MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTER)'ATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR FOR A SOCIAL SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of El Salvador for US$26.0 million equivalent i8 submitted for your
approval. The proposed loan vould be repayable over 20 years, including five
years of grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate and charges. The project
would be cofinanced on a parallel basis by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) for US$2.1 million equivalent, and by the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for US$0.3 million equivalent. The Government of
El Salvador (GOES) would be the Borrower and the Ministries of Planning (HIPLAN),
Health (MOE), and Education (MOE) would be the executing agencies.
2.      Background.  The combination of economic crisis, a devastating earthquake
in 1986, and internal warfare in the countryside have resulted in a deterioration
of public services in El Salvador. During the last ten years the share of public
spending on social sectors fell from 40 percent to 24 percent, and real per-capita
outlays on social services, by over 42 percent. Spending on education and health
declined the most as a percentage of GDP -- from about 3.9 percent on education
and over 1.8 percent on health in 1980 -- to 1.8 percent on education and 0.9
percent on healthi in 1989.
3.      Social indicators remain among the lowest in Latin America.  Infant
mortality is 5711,000 live births, maternal mortality is 1.411,000, and 50 percent
of children under 5 years of age suffer from malnutrition. About 35 percent of
the population are illiterate, and the average school attainment is 4.5 years,
whereas in rural areas is 3.1 years. Social ministries have a limited coverage.
While the social security system covers about 10 percent of the population, the
MOH services cover only 56 percent of the uninsured population, and the primary
school enrollment rate remains below 1979 level at 70 percent. External aid,
communities and NGOs have made increasing contributions to the social sectors,
helping to mitigate the impact of falling public resources, but their volume has
been insufficient to offset the decrease in the domestically financed public
spending.
4.      In June 1989, the GOES embarked on a far-reaching and radical economic
reform program to put the economy on a path of sustainable growth. This program
aims to create a more liberalized, private-sector led economy, focusing on reforms
in the external, fiscal, monetary, financial and agricultural sectors, with
special attention to poverty alleviation and delivery of social services. The
goal of the Government's social sector strategy as expressed in the Socioeconomic
Development Plan 1990-94, is for the social sectors to reverie past poverty trends
through: (a) implementation of compensatory programs such as rural public works
projects, a Social Investment Fund, and targeted nutrition programs for the most
vulnerable groups as an essential corollary to the structural adjustment program;
(b) strengthening delivery of basic social services, mainly health and education,
to increase the human capital of the poor; and (c) institutional improvements and
intra-sectoral reallocation of resources in favor of primary health and education
services. New initiatives are being designed in both the health and education
sectors to improve management practices and implementation capacity. The GOES
intends to gradually decentralize management responsibilities to the regional
levels and increase the participation of the private sector and communities.
Through a newly established system for monitoring public investment, the
Government is committed to shift the structure of public investment and raise the



share of social programs and projects from 20 percent to 50 percent of public
investment by 1994. Because of budgetary limitations, the GOES also intends to
implement policies that would Zenerate greater revenues, such as user charges,
improved efficiency in service delivery, and mobilize cwmmunity resources in
support of health and education services.
5.      Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the
proposed project is justified on four grounds. First, the proposed project is an
integral part of the Bank's assistance strategy for El Salvador, supporting
structural adjustment, emphasis in the social sectors, and poverty alleviation.
As a complement to the recently approved Structural Adjustment Loan, the propoaed
project would address the basic needs of the poor in some 80 most disadvantaged
municipalities of the country, thus alleviating the social costs of adjustment
among the most vulnerable groups. Second, it would help the government increase
and reorient public health and education expenditures toward basic health and
education services and targeted nutrition programs, thus improving the efficiency
of such expenditures. Third, the proposed project would facilitate the
implementation of the goverrnent's policies to improve management and efficiency
of services delivery, thus generating greater revenues through cost-recovery and
community participation in support of health and education services. Fourth, the
proposed project would assist the Government to promote effective donor
coordination and mobilize external funds for El Salvador's social programs. The
proposed project is the first operation in the social sector after 11 years of
hiatus. The four previous Bank financed projects suffered from implementation
delays due to weak management, burdensome procedures for the approval of contracts
and bidding documents, shortage of counterpart financing, and internal state of
unrest. The propos.d project design takes into account the lessons learnad from
past experience; it uses the existing organizational structure of the government
for project implementation, instead of creating a new one; international agents
would be hired as procurement agents to promote efficient procurement;
government's specific assurances were obtained at negotiations regarding the
provision of annual counterpart funds and increases in social sector Investments;
and provisions were incorporated to accommodate possible changes in the project
area due to internal strife during project implementation.
6.      Prolect Obiectives.  The proposed project would:  (a) improve the coverage
and delivery of basic social services targeted to about 1.1 million people in some
80 of the poorest municipalities of the country. Selection of the priority areas
is based on the severity of malnutrition among children, and insufficient supply
of basic health and school services; and (b) strengthen the institutional
capabilities of MIPLAN, MON and MOE to plan, manage, and evaluate delivery of
social programs efficiently.
7.      Proisct Description.  The proposed project consists of two major
components. The Basic Services Devclopment component (61 percent of total project
cost) would improve coverage and efficiency ois (i) primary health care program
consisting of family planning, maternal and child health care, mutrition, and safe
motherhood referral program; and (ii) pre-trimary and primary education program
consisting of implementation of community operated schools, provision of teaching
materials and textbooks, nutrition assistance, and teachers training. The
InstItutMo&al Develo_ment component (39 percent of total project cost) would: (i)
strengthen MOB capacity for planning, management, delivery of primary health
services, and cost-recovery; (ii) improve MOE capacity in planning and evaluation,
management, supervision, textbooks and teaching materials distribution, and staff
training; and (iii) strengthen MIPLAN capacity to develop a social sectors



- 3 -
information system, aaalyze social programs and evaluate their impact. The
project, expected to be implemented over four years, provides funds for training,
technical assistance and studies, vehicles, equipment, furniture, textbooks ai,d
instructional materials, and incremental operating costs (salaries, essential
drugs, micronutrients, and other supplies).
8.      The total project cost is estimated at US$35.6 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$9 1 aillion (26 percent).  A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$2.6 million would be granted for
expenditures incurred after March 6, 1991. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in El Salvador are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9533-ES, dated
May 31, 1991, is also attached.
9.      Implementation Arrangements.  The borrower would be GOES, which would act
as the administrator of the loan. The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed
during a five-year period. The project would be implemented through the existing
crganizational structures of the MIPLAN, MOH and MOE, but project coordination
units (PCUs) have been established in the three ministries.
10.     Actions Agreed.  During neaotiations, the following main agreements were
reacheds (a) the Government would hire incremental staff for health posts and
units only to the extent that existing personnel cannot be reassigned from
hospitals or administrative posts; (b) the Government would submit to the Bank the
results and recommendations of all studies and actions plans prepared under the
proposed project, which would be reviewed at the annual review meetings; (c) a
central textbooks and materials distribution unit would be established in the MOE
by no later than December 31, 1991; (d) the GOES would increase aggregate
expenditures for primary health, pre-primary and primary education, and the share
of non-salary recurrent expenditures, and would provide counterpart funds as
required under the project including incremental recurrent expenditures generated
by the project; (e) annual audits would be carried out by external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank; (f) the Government would ensure the stability of PCUs'
staff; and (g) the Government would conduct annual reviews jointly with the Bank
on overall project implementation, including agreements on action plans and
schedules of implementation.
11.     The conditions of effectiveness would be.  (a) the Government would submit
to the Legislative Assembly a bill of Lav, satisfactory to the Bank, for purposes
of introducing the health promoterc as a regular and permanent position in the
MOB, and providing for, at least, 579 of such referred positions, and a proposed
budget law for fiscal year 1992, satisfactory to the Bank, providing adequate
funds to cover the payment of services of, at least, 579 health promoters; (b) the
MOE would approve norms and mechanisms (retlamento) of implementation of community
operated schools, and would furnish to the Bank 27 contracts with community
groups; (c) the Government would complete, satisfactory to the Bank, the final
design of the MOE supervision system including schedule of implementation,
training for supervisory personnel, and a proposal for the development of
supervision manuals; and (d) the Government would have entered into procurement
se-.vice agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with UNICEF and UNDP. A conditlon
of disbursement for the health promoters and primary health care sub-components
would be that the health promoter positions have been created, adequate funds made



- 4 -
available, and the MOH has duly employed the 579 health promoters referred to
above as regular and permanent ataff.
12.     Benefits.  The proiposed project would have direct benefits on the health
status of pregnant and lactating women, infants, and children, and would provide
improved pre-primary and primary education services in disadvantaged areas which
represent about 30 percent of the country's population. The provision of basic
health and education services to about 1.1 million poor would: (a) reduce the
prevalence of gastrointestinal, infectious and communicable diseases,
complications of pregnancy, and malnutrition, all of which are associated with
high rates of infant, child, and maternal mortality; (b) increase the enrollment
of pre-school age children, from 14 percent in 1989 to 18 percent in 1994, to
improve performance in primary school; and (c) increase primary school enrollment
in rural areas, from 61 percent in 1989 to 66 percent in 1994, and decrease
repetition and dropout rates among primary school age children.  Institutional
development would contribute to improved planning, personnel and financial
management; increased service delivery capacity; higher productivity in the health
and education sectors and efficient allocations of government resources.
Community participation would help delegate delivery of services to the local
level, increasing services efficiency, contributing to ease government's financial
con3straints, and augmenting the demand for these services. The project would
provide a model for other poverty areas in El Salvador, and lay the basis for an
effective decentralization of social services delivery with active participation
of the community.
13.     Risks.  The major risk is possible delays in project implementation due to
deficient management capacity. To minimize this risk: (a) assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the project coordinating units staff would not be
reassigned to other functions during the life of the project; (b) the project
would be implemented by the existing organizational units as properly
strengthened; (c) UNICEF and UNDP would be hired as procurement agents which would
train local staff to take over these tasks in the future; (d) a procurement
seminar was conducted to increase GOES familiarity with Bank's procedures, and a
project launch seminar covering all implementation aspects would take place before
loan effectiveness; and (e) adequate technical assistance and training would be
provided for project implementation. Frequent supervision would be undertaken
during implementation. Additionally, due to possible sporadic violence in El
Salvador, during project implementation, it may be difficult to realize project
objectives fully in all of the project municipalities. To minimize this risk, the
Government and the Bank agreed at negotiations that proceeds of the Loan would not
be disbursed in municipalities that are inaccessible, for purposes of project
implementation and supervision, according to the assessment of the Bank, until
security concerns dissipate.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
