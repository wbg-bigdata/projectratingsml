economically and environmentally viable integrated production systems among small and
medium-sized farmers and livestock producers, within a context of holistic ecosystem and
natural resources management; and (b) an increased understanding of the role of biodiversity in
agricultural landscapes and the potential impact of the various land use practices upon
biodiversity and their economic and ecological sustainability.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

Revised Global Environment Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

  Note: The PAD Results Framework and Monitoring Matrix included an excessive number of
both KPIs and IOIs without initial targets. Specific target values for five KPIs were subsequently
defined in the Implementation Letter (dated June 16, 2005), with more targets added through the
first version of the Operational Manual (September 2005) and an M&E report prepared by PEU
(dated November 21, 2005). During MTR, consolidation and clustering of indicators, as well as
redefining of some targets, eliminated redundancies and streamlined relevant KPIs and IOIs.
These revisions were reflected immediately following MTR and incorporated in the project
Operational Manual. See Annex 2, Appendix 1 “Indicators Summary Table? for more details.
Presented below are the PAD KPIs and IOIs with revised target values where applicable.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Country and sector background: Uruguay has a rich natural resource base for livestock
and agricultural production and at the time of appraisal (2005), the agriculture and agro-
industrial sectors represented about 23 percent of national GDP. Over half of Uruguay’s
combined output was being exported, and further export growth was considered essential to
support national economic development, focusing on production specialization, quality, and
processing. Uruguay’s biodiversity is globally significant due to its location in the confluence of
the Amazonian and Chaco domains, with principal eco-systems comprising savannah, native
forests, wetlands, coastal ecosystems (including associated wildlife). However, despite the value
of its global biodiversity, Uruguay has very few national (or sub-national) protected areas,
reinforcing the importance of conservation efforts through private properties or other
arrangements.

1.1.2 The original savannah ecosystem with associated forests had been heavily altered by
several hundred years of extensive and increasingly intensive livestock production. Severe and
moderate soil erosion had affected about 10 percent of this area. Of the 16 million hectares
appropriate for livestock and agricultural production, some 70 percent were still under natural
pasture but in vulnerable condition due to fragmentation resulting in isolated plant populations
and threatening the fauna associated with these native grasslands. At time of appraisal,
awareness was growing that increased production and productivity in the livestock and
agricultural sub-sectors had to come from sustainable intensification of existing areas and not
further land conversion—compatible with the protection and conservation of the natural resource
base. The Government of Uruguay (GOU) also acknowledged the public sector’s key role in
promoting sustainable rural development through supportive investment in public goods and an
incentive structure that encourages responsible practices in the private sector.

1.1.2 It is important to note that due to the negative impacts of the regional economic and
financial crisis of 2002, Uruguay was in the midst of a dual transition at the time of project
design and launch: (i) an economic transition towards a path of equitable and sustainable
development, as the economy continued to recover; and (ii) a political transition, as the victory
of the Frente Amplio coalition in the October 2004 elections marked a new phase in the
country’s political history. As a result, the Bank Group’s assistance over the period covered by
the CAS discussed by Board on June 9, 2005 (FY05-10, Report No. 31804-UY) proposed a
strategic program of lending and non-lending services to support the main objective of the new
administration’s development plan “El Gobierno de Cambio–La Transición Responsable,? which
was the attainment of equitable and sustainable economic development. To attain this longer-
term goal, the GOU prioritized reducing vulnerability, sustaining growth, and improving living
standards. The GOU sought to direct the goals and results of the project in order to achieve
progress in the agricultural sector under all three of these priority areas.

1.1.3 Rationale for Bank assistance: The Uruguayan agricultural sector had benefited from
more than 50 years of collaboration between the GOU and the Bank with efforts shifting over

                                                1
  time from a focus on productive aspects to a broader approach emphasizing environmental issues
  and longer-term sustainable production systems, mainly through improved natural resources
  management (NRM). The rationale for Bank involvement incorporated lessons from the Natural
  Resources Management and Irrigation Development Project or PRENADER (Loan 3697-UY,
  1994-2002, P008173), Global Environment Facility (GEF) financed biodiversity projects in the
  region, and the Bank-led sector review report, Uruguay: the Rural Sector and Natural Resources
  (Report No. 24409-UR, 2002). The Integrated Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management
  Project (Proyecto de Produccion Responable or PPR) was partially financed through GEF
  resources (fully-blended) and, consistent with the GEF Strategic Priority of Mainstreaming
  Biodiversity in Production Landscapes, through: (i) developing systemic and institutional
  capacities of GOU agencies and other stakeholders and management procedures; (ii)
  disseminating relevant knowledge; and (iii) promoting partnership building between agencies,
  local communities and the private sector to secure biodiversity conservation.

  1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Performance
  Indicators, and reasons/justification

  1.4.1 The PDO was not revised during the project. The PAD Results Framework and
  Monitoring Matrix (Annex 3) originally included an excessive number of both Key Performance
  Indicators (KPIs) and Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) without targets (see 2.1.5 for
  further details). As a first step, specific target values for five KPIs were defined in the
  Implementation Letter (dated June 16, 2005), as well as in preparation of the first version of the
  Operational Manual (September 2005), which was approved by the Bank prior to effectiveness.
  Further definition of indicators and targets for both KPIs and IOIs (as presented in the PAD) to
  be monitored throughout the life of the project by the M&E team of the Project Executing Unit
  (PEU) and the Bank were included in a report dated November 21, 2005 (prepared by the PEU
  and a Bank consultant specialized in M&E and incorporated into the Operational Manual) and
  progress was reflected in mission Aide Memoires and Bank ISRs. The Mid-Term Review (MTR)
  proposed the consolidation and improved clustering of some indicators, as well as the reduction
  of the target value for the area4 to be supported by the project, in order to reflect the actual
  average size of beneficiary farms and eliminate some of the initial redundancies in the KPIs and
  IOIs, for both the PDO and GEO. These changes occurred immediately post-MTR and were
  formalized via revision of the project Operational Manual.5 See table below, as well as Annex 2,
  Appendix 1 “Indicators Summary Table? for more details.

                                    Revised KPIs Post-MTR
      Project Development Objectives6            Revised Key Performance Indicators
1. Promote the adoption of economically and                      -3,500 proposals presented for integrated production systems at farm

and the potential impact of the various land use                 -100,000 hectares administered by small and medium producers in the
practices upon biodiversity and their economic                   management of biodiversity
and ecological sustainability.                                   -5,000 hectares of natural habitats including natural forests under
                                                                 restoration or management for conservation and production



  4
    Incoming administration’s policy shift to target small and medium-sized farmers as eligible beneficiaries greatly reduced (and excluded in the
  case of NRM subprojects) the number of medium and large-sized farmers/producers as potential beneficiaries (as included in the original project
  design). This shift had a substantial effect on the target area (1,000,000 hectares) and amount of beneficiary co-financing. As a result of the MTR
  revision process, target area was reduced to 620,000 hectares (although ultimately the project did reach an area of 881,882 hectares).
  5
     While such changes/revisions would currently require a formal restructuring (OP guidelines, specifically “Processing Restructuring of
  Investment Projects, Guidelines for Staff,? dated November 2009), the Team formalized them in revisions to the project Operational Manual, as
  restructuring, per the above guidelines, was still not required at the time these revisions were made.

     The following sub-objective was also included in PAD Annex 3 Results Framework, although not referenced in the PAD main text or
  Loan/Grant Agreements: To develop partnerships between the public and private sectors, including effective institutional collaboration within the
  public sector, and to strengthen a demand-driven approach to investment decisions and financing.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.5.1 The GEO was not revised during the project. Given that the Bank loan and the GEF grant
were implemented in a fully integrated manner, the project’s revision of indicators (Section 1.4)
also included GEO KPIs and other IOIs linked to the conservation of biodiversity. In this case,
the revision/consolidation process was particularly relevant, given that project design explicitly
included an unusually high number of biodiversity-related IOIs to ensure that MGAP would
adequately address the incorporation of biodiversity into the productive landscape.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries (as approved)

1.6.1 As approved in the PAD, the primary target beneficiary population of PPR was small and
medium-sized farmers, particularly those with interest in or need for incorporating NRM and
biodiversity conservation practices in their operations. The project was demand-driven. At higher
levels, MGAP was expected to strengthen its overall NRM capacity, while other relevant sector
institutions at the central and regional levels would be strengthened to develop and implement
national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity and to
promote their mainstreaming/integration in sector development programs.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

1.7.1   Project objectives were to be achieved through four components (see Annex 2):

  Component 1: Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management (estimated total cost at
  time of appraisal US$87.63 million, including US$25.17 million IBRD financing and
  US$4.97 million GEF resources): technical and financial assistance to demand-driven
  activities to promote sustainable management of natural pastures and rain-fed as well as
  irrigated agriculture. GEF resources would support mainstreaming demand for biodiversity
  initiatives in priority ecosystems.
  Component 2: Establishment of Pilot Areas (estimated total cost US$1.50 million, 100
  percent GEF-financed): implementation of pilot demonstrations of sustainable use of natural
  resources and biodiversity in key micro-watersheds.
  Component 3: Support Services (estimated total cost US$3.86 million, including US$2.87
  million IBRD financing and US$0.29 million GEF resources): training to farmers,
  institutional strengthening of local and central authorities, (through improved GIS and

                                                     4
  studies), studies and applied research, and specialized training for technical staff providing
  technical assistance (TA) to farmers.
  Component 4: Project Executing Unit (estimated total cost US$2.61 million, including
  US$1.80 million IBRD financing and US$0.25 million GEF resources): overall project
  implementation and the Monitoring and Evaluation System.

1.8 Revised Components

1.8.1   Components were not revised.

1.9 Other significant changes

1.9.1 Changes in target beneficiary population: Following the change in government
between appraisal and Board approval, the target beneficiary population focus shifted from
medium-sized farming operations to a category called “family farmers.? This category, officially
defined by Ministerial decree, included several criteria related to size of holding (mostly
comprised of small and the lower segment of medium-sized farmers, but differentiated by
production system), on-farm labor structure, and residential status. This official definition was
adopted in the Operational Manual as the criterion for determining eligibility. Exceptions were
made for selected biodiversity subprojects, in which the objective of the subproject required
project support to larger livestock producers with more extensive holdings. As a result, the
beneficiary contribution to subprojects (and consequently overall project costs) was considerably
lower than anticipated in the PAD due to a lower co-financing requirement from small farmers—
although the loan amount and counterpart funding remained unchanged. The expected aggregate
target area covered by the project was also reduced, but the number and location of project
beneficiaries, as well as impact and behavioral change, were more widespread geographically.

1.9.2 Revised important project dates: (i) Loan Agreement was amended to extend the date
of effectiveness by 21 days (September 14, 2005 to October 5, 2005), as all conditions of
effectiveness had been met including adoption of the Operational Manual but the FM Specialist
was unable to finalize discussion of Financial Management Report (FMR) format with Borrower;
and (ii) Project closing date was extended 12 months to August 31, 2012 to permit full
disbursement of the GEF Grant and achievement of project objectives (both Loan Agreement
and Grant Agreement were modified accordingly).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 The blending of GEF resources in project design to support biodiversity conservation
represented, at that time, a highly innovative (and challenging) decision based on the assumption
that the most important elements of Uruguay’s biodiversity were located on private lands,
primarily dedicated to extensive livestock production. This basic assumption supported the two
main design elements of PPR and associated activities, that: (i) effective conservation of the
country’s biological resources required the active mainstreaming of biodiversity into the policies
and instruments of the production-oriented MGAP, and (ii) Uruguay’s unique features

                                                5
constituted an ideal environment to fully integrate biodiversity as a key element of a project
aimed at supporting a comprehensive NRM strategy.

2.1.2 Specific lessons from related GEF operations included the need for: innovative financing
and support mechanisms for long-term conservation of biodiversity, especially outside protected
areas; addressing the root causes of biodiversity loss, such as social and political factors;
mainstreaming biodiversity in national economic development plans to avoid becoming an
isolated, stand-alone activity; ensuring long-term sustainability; stakeholders’ participation from
beginning to build ownership in biodiversity conservation; private sector incorporated into
biodiversity management, especially outside protected areas—as in Uruguay’s case, where
biodiversity conservation is primarily in private hands; and local/regional capacity-building as
essential to ensure an adequate legal and policy framework and needed skills/knowledge.

2.1.3 Risk Assessment: This adjustment process during the latter part of project preparation
provided substantial elements to increase the potential risks, mainly those associated with: (i)
institutional capacity for project implementation (rated High in the PAD), and (ii) generation of
demand among farmers for investments in NRM and biodiversity (rated Moderate in the PAD).
The Bank’s decision to delay Board approval by one year not only enabled the new
administration to secure ownership, but also allowed for the development of a constructive
dialogue with the incoming authorities to agree on measures to mitigate these risks. Although
these factors did contribute to the initially slow implementation of the project, the overall
physical and financial performance achieved by the project would suggest that the mitigation
measures applied were adequate to address the envisaged risks.

2.1.4 Indicators: With regards to ensuring quality at entry, an area which required revisions at
the time of the MTR was the inclusion by the Bank preparation team of an extensive list of both
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) in the PAD
Results Framework and Monitoring Matrix. The initial over-design of this lengthy and broad list
of KPIs and IOIs, many of which were difficult to quantify or adequately measure, created
confusion at the time of project launch as to the actual number of indicators that could be
effectively monitored due to limited resources, as well as later on during subsequent evaluations
of the project and at project closure (Borrower Completion Report, or BCR, and this ICR).
Furthermore, insufficient data collection during project implementation, along with no
beneficiary production baseline established at the level of subprojects (nor indicators to measure
production/productivity), did not allow for a full, traditional ex-post economic and financial
analysis of subprojects, or alternatively, a full cost-effectiveness analysis (see Annex 3). This
was primarily due to the nature of KPIs and IOIs focused on measuring NRM and biodiversity
conservation improvements, but not sufficient to measure increases to income, productivity, or
the economic viability of subprojects.

2.2 Implementation

Factors affecting project implementation and outcome:

2.2.1 Initial implementation progress was slow due to several factors: lack of experience by the
new administration, PEU set up, promotion of subproject guidelines, development of

                                                6
capacity/demand for biodiversity conservation subprojects, and the operational complexity of
blended source of funds. However, once the initial pipeline of subprojects was established, PEU
management began addressing needs of the remaining components/subcomponents of the project,
and an acceptable/balanced rate of implementation was reached in Year 2 and effectively
sustained throughout the life of the project. While the implementation approach was strongly
focused on the subproject cycle, the overall positive outcomes of PPR were, to a large extent, the
result of the effective integration of subprojects with activities under Components 2 and 3. The
main challenge facing Component 1 was the development of initial demand for NRM proposals,
and more so for biodiversity-related initiatives. These difficulties were gradually overcome
through recruitment of a dedicated team of biodiversity specialists, consolidation of the technical
and operational framework, and establishment of a network of individuals/institutions with
interest in promoting biodiversity conservation initiatives.

2.2.2 Although PPR was implemented within the overall conceptual and operational
framework developed during preparation, two important factors influenced implementation,
which were overcome/mitigated through effective PEU planning and performance:
(i)   Increasing climatic variability. The agricultural sector was affected by three unusually
      severe summer droughts, with considerable impact on overall sector output, particularly
      the dairy and beef subsectors. The first drought occurred in the summer of 2006,
      coinciding with the initial stages of project implementation, and underscored the
      important role of PPR in substituting public emergency assistance with investments that
      would help prevent the devastating effects of subsequent summer droughts on “family
      farmers.? In response to this and within PPR’s existing menu of improved NRM activities,
      the GOU and Bank agreed on giving priority to farmers’ demand for improved on-farm
      supply of water for livestock consumption. This experience emphasized the point that
      climate variability/beneficiary vulnerability should be taken into consideration at project
      design, as the benefits accrued by producers from project-financed investments can be
      easily lost as a result of droughts or other climate related adversities;
(ii)  MGAP Structural Changes. During initial years of implementation, MGAP experienced
      considerable institutional volatility primarily due to structural changes by the incoming
      administration and ministry authorities. After several adjustments among entities’ roles
      and responsibilities within MGAP, in 2009 the Directorate for Rural Development
      (DGDR) was created and given responsibility to coordinate all MGAP programs
      involving support to “family farmers,? including PPR (See Section 5.2).

2.2.3 Mid-Term Review: A full assessment of PPR’s implementation performance was
conducted in August 2009 as part of the MTR, including a comprehensive, independently-
prepared report produced by a team working under the coordination of one of the nation’s largest
family producer organizations (Centro Cooperativista Uruguayo or CCU). The report was
enriched by a participatory consultation process in which a broad sample of project beneficiaries
and stakeholders contributed opinions and recommendations to improve project performance.
The conclusions and recommendations of the report were jointly analyzed by MGAP authorities
and the Bank, resulting in a series of adjustments to project implementation, which were
reflected in a detailed Action Plan and subsequently in revisions to the Operational Manual.

2.2.4   Project at Risk: The project was never declared at risk.

                                                7
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design: Specific software to ensure adequate project monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
was included in project design and scheduled to be developed during the first year of project
execution. This software, or Monitoring Information System (MIS), was intended to create a
baseline and measure project performance, results, and provide data for the assessment of
impacts. Shortcomings in design worth highlighting here, however, were the lack of (i)
beneficiary production baselines established at the level of subprojects, and (ii) inclusion of
indicators to measure the “economically-viable? aspect to the PDO. Nevertheless, some
economic data points collected during the M&E process were able to be adapted in order prepare
the ex-post analysis, as presented in Annex 3, and notwithstanding the limitations at project
outset with regards to the M&E system, the project team was still able to report on almost all
project indicators by project close.

2.3.2 Implementation: Due to budgetary constraints and consequent austerity measures
enforced by the new administration, the intended tailor-made MIS system was not contracted and
implemented. In place of that software system, the PEU developed a simplified (and less costly)
spreadsheet-based M&E system which, although less automated and unable to provide as
effective real-time data, still captured valuable project information. It was also able to produce an
impressive amount of data, and capture/contribute important information used in training and
dissemination materials (see Annex 9).

2.3.3 Utilization: Using the spreadsheet-based M&E system, the PEU and Bank team were
able to assess progress and performance of project components, and suggest
improvement/adjustments during regular Supervision missions. The collected data also assisted
during Bank/GOU portfolio reviews and in preparation of ISRs, as well as supporting project
evaluations, particularly at project mid-term and project-closure with the Sustainability
Assessment, Beneficiary Survey (see Annex 5), and Borrower Completion Report (BCR). It is
important to note the significant amount of information collected, reported, and analyzed through
the BCR, regarding project results and performance.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards compliance: PPR was classified Category B (Partial Assessment), and
safeguards performance/compliance was rated uniformly Satisfactory by supervision missions. In
conformity with OP 4.01, an ex-ante Environmental Assessment (EA) was carried out and
determined overall that anticipated (demand-driven) project interventions would facilitate
significant improvement in the quality of land and water resources. In general, irrigation
activities were determined to be those posing potential risk of negative environmental impact.
Other isolated cases were also identified during the EA where performance could have been
improved and this led to the introduction (and included in the Operational Manual) of a
“blacklist? which specified activities ineligible for funding. All subproject funding proposals
from potential beneficiary farmers or groups were required to include a statement on any
potential environmental consequences, which were then screened by the PEU following this
“blacklist.? The project team also included a Senior Environmental Specialist and supervision of
compliance with triggered safeguards was thorough and consistent, aiming to avoid and/or

                                                 8
minimize any potential negative impacts. Of all 5,300 subprojects implemented, preparation of
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was never necessary as none of the proposals
presented were evaluated as having any foreseen negative environmental impacts.

Fiduciary compliance:

2.4.2 Financial Management (FM): FM performance varied over the course of the project,
with most deficiencies occurring during the first two years of the project. FM supervision was
intensive in the initial years, primarily due to the lack of experience of the PEU with Bank FM
procedures/systems and human resource issues. Minor problems were diagnosed and evaluated,
hands-on training was provided, and time-bound action plans and close follow-up sought to
correct deficiencies. FM staffing, organization, information, archiving, and reporting were
substantially improved by the MTR and through project closing. All FM project ratings were
Satisfactory or higher in the case of government commitment and transparency.

2.4.3 Audit: Some audit misinterpretation by the PEU occurred at different times during the
project and audits were at times delayed in following established timetables. Auditors’ opinions
were generally unqualified, and the few qualified opinions were adequately addressed—the latter
reflecting the same internal control risks/deficiencies detected by Bank FM missions. MGAP and
the PEU worked diligently with the Bank FM team to resolve all issues defined.

2.4.4 Procurement: Performance was mixed throughout project implementation, with some
weaknesses identified, primarily due to inexperience with Bank procurement guidelines. Bank-
administered training informed and assisted key PEU staff to become better-acquainted with
Bank fiduciary requirements and accelerated procurement processing. Based on the findings of
the final review (PPP) which indicated some shortcomings in shopping procedures (use of point
system for goods, qualification of individual consultants), overall project procurement was rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 New lending operations: Largely due to the success of PPR, MGAP has continued to
develop and implement an innovative, integrated, and inclusive “climate-smart? agricultural and
rural development program. As a result, MGAP requested a new Bank-financed operation,
prioritized in the 2010-2015 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (Report #55863-UY, discussed
by the Executive Directors on August 18, 2010) which preserves the main pillars of PPR, while
incorporating measures to address the main lesson learned regarding vulnerability of
beneficiaries to the effects of climate variability. The recently-approved and effective operation
Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Climate Change Project (P124181), locally
known as the Proyecto de Desarrollo y Adaptación al Cambio Climático or DACC, includes
measures to enhance intra-ministerial (MGAP) collaboration between different departments, and
financial incentives (matching grants) and TA for on-farm investments in economically and
environmentally sustainable agricultural and livestock production practices (designed to improve
their resilience to extreme climatic events) to some 4,000 “family farmers? and medium-sized
farmers. This innovative project also includes the important technical design of an Agricultural
Information and Decision Support System which will consolidate many different sources of in-

                                                9
country information to generate short and medium term climate forecasting and inform
policymakers and farmers alike with “actionable? data for implementing climate change
adaptation strategies. Furthermore, the recently launched Climate-Smart Agricultural Water
Management TA (P144985) is envisioned to build further upon the foundation laid by PPR’s
successes and continue the GOU’s “climate-smart? agricultural and rural development program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 PPR’s objectives were innovative, both nationally and globally, and remain highly
relevant to the Bank’s partnership strategy and major pillars from the current 2010-2015 CPS
(Report #55863-UY) with Uruguay. As mentioned, PPR laid important groundwork for the on-
going DACC project (P124181) which represents one element of an integrated results-oriented
approach that would also include: (i) Bank assistance to MGAP to access other possible sources
of bilateral and multilateral financing for climate change; (ii) Bank analytical support in the form
of an AAA on “Low Carbon Growth Strategies for Agriculture and the Uruguayan Economy?
and a feasibility study for the “Introduction of NDVI/Weather Index Insurance to cover
grassland production in Uruguay?; and (iii) Bank TA and collaboration with MGAP regarding
dissemination of experiences, organization of conferences, and participation in international
events related to climate change. As did PPR, DACC continues to support the GOU’s National
Plan of Response to Climate Change (NPRCC) and Biodiversity Strategy.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

3.2.1 PPR represents an exemplary blending of IBRD and GEF resources, which successfully
achieved both the sustainable integration of NRM and the biodiversity conservation objectives of
the PDO and the GEO, with most targets surpassed. The following results were achieved, citing
key indicators and supporting evidence (see also Data Sheet and Annexes 2 and 3 for details).

Objective 1, Natural Resources Management: Adoption of economically and
environmentally viable integrated production systems by small and medium-sized farmers
in their production systems (both individually and in groups), within the context of holistic
eco-system and NRM (Substantially Achieved)

3.2.2 PPR has made a considerable contribution to the improvement of NRM in Uruguay’s
agricultural sector by supporting agro-environmental on-farm investments (mainly in the beef
and dairy subsectors) and promoting technologies that reduce the vulnerability of producers to
the country’s increasing climatic variability. The technical and financial assistance provided to
over 4,600 small and medium producers (representing almost 25 percent of total number of
“family farmers? in the country) resulted in improved soil and water management in almost
900,000 hectares of privately owned land. These direct interventions represented the main pillar
within a broader strategy aimed at achieving the sustainable adoption and dissemination of
improved NRM practices, that included outreach/training (2,600 public and private service
providers, 28,000 producers, and 150,000 indirect beneficiaries), publications, and institutional
strengthening (support to 56 local producer organizations, and relevant public agencies). In

                                                10
addition, these important achievements were enhanced by providing complementary services
which included TA to farmers, improved communication to raise awareness on NRM and
biodiversity matters, and institutional strengthening of MGAP and farmer organizations. This
integrated effort has led to increased understanding by all stakeholders that policies and
technologies can be applied to ensure that productive intensification is achieved without
deteriorating the country’s natural resource base.

3.2.3 Specific NRM-related achievements can be summarized as follows:
 The comprehensive set of agro-environmental practices (and sample-derived estimated
    results, see Annex 2) supported by PPR, include: (i) manure management systems in dairy
    farms (improved milk quality, 20-25 percent reduction in milking times); (ii) substitution of
    chemicals with natural (solar) disinfection of soils in horticulture (30 percent decrease in
    costs, improved soil quality); (iii) improved water management in intensive grazing systems
    (live weight gain increase 20-30 kg/hectare/yr); (iv) reduced soil degradation and erosion
    through promotion of crop rotations, increased soil coverage, and conservation tillage
    (increase 20 percent in total gross production, reduced operating costs); (v) improved
    grassland management through fencing and water distribution systems (increased grazing
    time by 30 percent, increased pasture area by +30 percent, increased dry matter production
    by 10 percent); and (vii) communal infrastructure for storage, treatment and
    disposal/recycling of agrochemical containers
 PPR led to improved farmer income, primarily due to increased productivity in dairy,
    livestock, and agricultural systems: (i) Livestock subsector: productivity improvement of
    344,240 livestock units (LU) by an average 20kg per year resulting in an estimated total
    incremental income of US$20.9 million per year; (ii) Dairy sector: improved water
    distribution/quality to milking cows, resulting in an estimated increase in productivity of 1.3
    liters animal/day and a total incremental income of US$33.5 million per year; and (iii)
    Horticulture sector: productivity increase of about 15 percent on average, as well as
    anticipated output sustainability over time
 PPR led to significantly reduced losses during the severe droughts faced by farmers in 2008
    and 2010, potentially exceeding avoided losses of US$30 million, through co-financing 1,600
    small on-farm reservoirs (tajamares), as well as developing a technological package for their
    improved design, construction, and management

Objective 2, Biodiversity: Increased understanding of the role of biodiversity in
agricultural landscapes and the potential impact of the various land use practices upon
biodiversity and their economic and ecological sustainability (Substantially Achieved)

3.2.4 PPR contributed important information, facilitated understanding, and led to behavioral
changes     within   Uruguay’s     livestock     and    agricultural    sectors   towards    the
incorporation/mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation in production practices (producers)
and policy/agendas (agricultural institutions/organizations). In addition, farmers’ capacity for
climate change adaptation has been strengthened due to project activities.

3.2.5 Specific biodiversity-related achievements can be summarized as follows:
 PPR carried out a total series of 78 capacity building events in relevant thematic areas
    including biodiversity conservation, making a substantial contribution to MGAP’s efforts to

                                                11
    increase overall knowledge and understanding of biodiversity conservation at all levels
    (MGAP staff, central and local public institutions, farmer organizations, producers, private
    extension and TA providers, rural teachers and students, and general public). This was
    complemented by knowledge products developed or promoted by PPR, including
    publications, manuals, studies, videos, brochures, webpage, local and international
    conferences and seminars, etc. (see Annex 9 for details).
   56 cooperation agreements (convenios) were signed with local and national agricultural
    organizations to promote government services to enhance the integrated management of
    natural resources and biodiversity conservation in the sector, all of which are expected to
    enhance the sustainability of the investments financed by PPR.

Global Environmental Objective: Conservation of important parts of Uruguay’s globally
significant biodiversity through financing the incremental costs associated with integrating
production systems in key biodiversity areas (Substantially Achieved)

3.2.6 PPR successfully promoted among farmers/producers important biodiversity
conservation and NRM practices, leading to conservation of globally significant biodiversity. Of
the 5,300 subprojects, 1,308 were targeted specifically to promote biodiversity conservation
practices (627 in extensive livestock operations blending NRM-biodiversity). Furthermore, 47
subprojects promoting ecotourism not only allowed small and medium farmers to establish rural
tourism operations but also raised awareness. The more noteworthy “outcome? achievements
include how PPR has led to a new biological vision (or “biodiversity-awareness?) for both the
productive sector and public institutions, spurring important behavioral changes for inclusion of
biodiversity in production/management decisions and policy strategies. This has been achieved
through the blending of actions supporting both NRM and biodiversity within both the public
and private sectors—a particularly notable achievement, considering the fact that MGAP
previously had very limited knowledge/experience related to biodiversity matters and the
country’s rich biodiversity is mainly concentrated in private lands.

3.2.7 Specific GEO-related achievements can be summarized as follows:
 Conservation protection measures providing direct/indirect improvements to conservation of
    243 native species (83 fauna, 160 flora), including 79 listed by IUCN’s Red List, 18 by
    CITES, and 51 defined as priority species by the National System of Protected Areas
    (SNAP);
 Regeneration/improved management of natural pastures and native forest;
 Establishment of conservation areas on farms to protect particular species or key sites of high
    biodiversity, e.g. conservation measures for wild deer populations, grassland birds, feathery
    palms, as well as numerous protected areas for regeneration of degraded environments in
    various parts of the country;
 Control of invasive alien flora and fauna species affecting both biodiversity and production;
 Protection of bio-diverse “riparian areas? which provide various ecosystem services: filtering
    pollutants, nutrient uptake in plant biomass, and habitat/food for many animal groups;
 Existing Geographic Information System (GIS) of MGAP improved by adding 6
    biodiversity-related layers through over 70 individual layers and 210 maps. Themes include:
    (i) Biodiversity Database, (ii) Eco-regional maps, (iii) classification of environments, (iv)


                                               12
     geo-location of farm-level water-harvesting facilities, (v) Freshwater Native Fish Database,
     and (vi) NRM subproject database with geo-referenced spatial location;
    Completion of comprehensive multidisciplinary Eco-regional Planning Study of country’s
     main natural habitats, and pilot projects developed in 10 biodiversity priority areas.

3.2.8 Project costs and financing: Total actual project costs were US$47.59 million,
comprising US$30 million IBRD loan funds; US$7 million GEF grant funds; GOU counterpart
funds totaling US$4.6 million; and beneficiary co-financing contributions of US$6 million.
Although the original loan, grant, and counterpart funding amounts remained unchanged and
were fully disbursed, total project costs were approximately 50 percent lower than estimated at
appraisal (see Annex 1), primarily due to the aforementioned shift in target beneficiary
population focus from medium-sized farming operations to “family farmers? (see 1.9.1). As a
result, beneficiary contribution to subprojects (and consequently, overall project costs) was
considerably lower than anticipated in the PAD due to a lower co-financing requirement.

3.2.9 Component 1, Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management, accounted for the bulk
of resources invested representing a high proportion of total project costs, 82.6 percent.
Investments in the other Components were as follows: Component 2, Pilot Areas, 5.2 percent;
Component 3, Institutional Strengthening and Training, 3.3 percent; and Component 4, Project
Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, 8.8 percent.

3.2.10 Co-financing: Under Component 1, PPR financed demand-driven subprojects
promoting/supporting integrated NRM and biodiversity conservation practices. Subprojects were
classified into four sub-components: (1) Soil and water; (2) Water use; (3) Management of
natural pastures; and (4) Conservation of biodiversity. Small-scale farmers co-financed 20
percent of the total subproject costs; and medium-scale farmers, 40 percent. For large farmers,
their original co-financing rate was 80 percent of subproject costs, but it decreased to 40 percent
in order to encourage the submission of subprojects focused on biodiversity conservation.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 The ex-post analysis of the project (Annex 3) focused primarily on illustrating the direct
economic and environmental impacts of the most common subprojects under the project by
quantifying increases in the income of participating farmers. 7 This analysis was based on a
sample of subprojects in the livestock, dairy, and horticulture subsectors; the sample differed
from models used during preparation, mainly due to the demand-driven nature and shift in focus
to “family farmers? (the PAD analysis was mainly supported by medium-sized rice farmers,
which were not included in the revised target population). PPR also achieved significant positive
environmental externalities which could not be quantified in monetary terms during the ex-post
economic analysis.




7
  During project appraisal, a cost benefit analysis was conducted leading to an estimated overall economic rate of return of 22.5 percent and
financial rates of return over 25 percent. Recalculation of the ERR and IRR at completion were not possible due to insufficient data collection
during project implementation to allow for a full cost benefit analysis or, alternatively, a cost effectiveness analysis ex-post. The lack of economic
data collection is attributable to the nature of project objectives/data being natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.

                                                                         13
3.3.2 Another important element indicative of project efficiency was the relatively large
amount of project funding (82.6 percent of project costs) that was transferred directly to the
hands of beneficiaries, either through funding of subprojects and/or through provision of TA
under Component 1. This proportional funding highlights not only the efficiency in allocation of
funds for direct investments, but also the array of knowledge-related and institutional
achievements obtained with the remaining 18 percent of project funds.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 Overall, PPR demonstrated notable levels of achievement with respect to PDO, GEO, and
performance indicators based on the following: (i) efficacy of project activities and achievements
as demonstrated through reported KPI and IOI final targets achieved; (ii) analysis indicating
project efficiency judged by its positive direct and indirect economic and environmental benefits;
and (iii) sustainability of project objectives ensured through demand-driven design, cost-sharing
with beneficiaries, TA network established, contribution to DACC project design, and positive
evidence/track record demonstrated in the Sustainability Assessment.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Complementing other MGAP initiatives specifically aimed at social and poverty issues in
rural areas (namely the Uruguay Rural Project financed by IFAD, approved December 2000,
US$24.5 million), PPR contributed to social development, gender, and poverty alleviation efforts
through a series of conceptual and operational elements. Most importantly, through focus on
family-based operations, subprojects involved nearly all family members in the design,
implementation, and subsequent benefits of subprojects and increased rural access to technology
and financial resources. At the community level, PPR promoted the implementation of group-
proposed subprojects and the empowerment of local producer organizations by strengthening and
promoting their inclusion in the subproject cycle as local beneficiary “screeners.? In addition,
PPR was instrumental in the delivery of comprehensive TA/outreach programs targeted at key
social development stakeholders (NGOs, cooperatives, rural development organizations, rural
teachers and students, etc.), job creation (particularly in rural areas), and support to numerous
community-based biodiversity subprojects.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 Although the vast majority of project funds (82.6 percent) were utilized to support on-
farm investments through Component 1, PPR achieved substantial results with regards to
institutional strengthening, both for public and private institutions.

3.5.3 Public sector institutional strengthening. Despite the institutional changes that affected
MGAP during the initial stages of the project, the support provided by ministry authorities
allowed the PEU (in particular the 19 decentralized professionals) to gradually develop
collaborative arrangements with key technical areas of MGAP. This served the dual purpose of
strengthening the PEU’s technical evaluation of subprojects and better aligning project actions

                                               14
with MGAP’s priorities. Two examples are emblematic of this approach: (i) MGAP’s response
to the 2006/2007 summer drought, which resulted in PPR’s highly successful drought prevention
subprojects, including the design and construction of small on-farm reservoirs (tajamares) and
increased awareness of the vulnerability of Uruguayan producers to climatic variability (see
DACC project); and (ii) PPR’s successful contribution to mainstream biodiversity elements
within the policies and instruments of public agricultural institutions through numerous
awareness campaigns and training events, as well as the development and dissemination of high
quality knowledge products focused on biodiversity (many technical studies and publications).

3.5.4 Private sector institutional strengthening. PPR also made a substantial contribution to
the development and operation of private institutions, mainly through engagement with local
producer organizations representing groups of “family farmers.? Through 56 formal agreements
(convenios) PPR provided technical and operational support to producer organizations, of which
the majority were small entities based in rural areas. These organizations also came to
understand the importance of sustainable NRM and biodiversity conservation, as well as the
empowerment induced by collaborative actions to secure improved provision of services to
members. Most importantly, the role of these organizations as facilitators in providing assistance
to MGAP strengthened the development and delivery of public policies and programs. In the
long run, these less tangible yet highly relevant contributions of the project represent important
pillars not only for the achievement of project objectives, but also for the consolidation of a new
collaborative model of public-private partnerships in the sector.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.5 PPR was the catalyst for the following noteworthy, unanticipated outcomes:
 As the droughts of 2008 and 2010 were unexpected, flexibility under Component 1 (i.e.
    demand-driven process for subprojects) allowed for meeting farmer demand to sufficiently
    adapt to drought conditions and thereby reduce overall vulnerability and production losses.
 Contracting of local technicians to provide TA and training directly on the farm sites
    expanded MGAP’s technical capacity and outreach. Also, beneficiaries in many instances
    were able to reciprocate and contribute to building further technical capacity by providing a
    producer-level, practical perspective for new ideas and approaches that could be replicated at
    a larger-scale in other parts of the country (where applicable).
 Under the demand-driven approach and the shift to “family farmers? as target beneficiaries, it
    was difficult for the PEU to estimate the amount and speed of initial responses to the first
    round of call-for-proposals. After an overwhelming response (possibly due to wide-spread
    communication and dissemination), the PEU was unable to disburse funding to approved
    subprojects rapidly enough to prevent frustration and disappointment from a number of initial
    beneficiaries. This experience, however, was limited to the first call for proposals and
    provided lessons for improving the subproject cycle and administrative capacity.
 Given PPR’s focus on “family farmers,? the demand/importance of partnerships (convenios)
    facilitating the growth and strength of producer organizations at the local level, with regards
    to NRM and biodiversity conservation, became an important element of project activities and
    helped facilitate longer-term sustainability.



                                                15
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 PPR carried out a Beneficiary Survey during the final months of implementation (see
Annex 5). Main findings were as follows: (i) beneficiaries assessed the overall project very
positively; (ii) beneficiaries who benefited from “integrated subprojects? expressed the highest
satisfaction levels; (iii) most beneficiaries reported that PPR contributed to improving their
livelihood, both in terms of increased income, as well as improved quality of life; (iv) water
management and pasture management were perceived as the most demanded interventions; (v)
beneficiaries described their relationship with PPR as “good,? and 70 percent of beneficiaries
said PPR improved their opinion about MGAP; (vi) the strategy to promote consolidation of
producers groups and stronger networks was rated as “successful;? (vii) most beneficiaries were
“very satisfied? with the support provided by PPR’s TA staff, and indications are that new
technical ties or working relationships were established after project completion; and (viii)
beneficiaries rated training, information sharing, and knowledge transfer activities as “very
useful and helpful.?

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environmental Outcome
Rating: Low

4.1     The overall rating regarding the risk to the sustainability of project development
and global environmental outcomes is supported by the following factors:
 Demand-driven approach helped ensure a “sense of ownership? in subproject investments,
    particularly as beneficiaries experienced positive direct and indirect benefits with regards to
    their productivity/incomes, quality of life, and physical environment (as documented in the
    MTR report, Beneficiary Survey, and Sustainability Assessment)
 Facilitation of private sector network (regionally-based) of TA providers supports the
    continuity and sustainability of services/activities demanded by producers
 Establishment of two Ministerial Task Forces to provide high-level advice on water and
    grasslands needs and priorities
 Mainstreaming of strategic alliances between MGAP and producer organizations as a means
    to enhance delivery of public support in rural areas
 Adoption of preventive public support instruments to replace traditional emergency
    assistance and help farmers cope with extreme climatic events
 Consolidation of decentralized institutional model of TA provision by DGDR
 Recent selection, through competitive procedures, of numerous former PEU members to
    become full-time staff of the Ministry
 Adoption by MGAP of key technical and operational elements through recently approved
    DACC Project and Adaptation Fund project
 Establishment of a permanent PEU by MGAP authorities to provide support to all
    multilateral lending operations and ensure continued administrative and managerial capacity
    for future Bank-lending operations

4.2    Sustainability: A comprehensive Sustainability Assessment of on-farm investments was
conducted as part of the final impact review by an independent team of consultants shortly
before project completion. The results of this Assessment were encouraging, determining that
over 90 percent of subprojects approved and implemented in the first two years of the project

                                                16
were still in a satisfactory state of operation and maintenance (O&M) four to five years later.
These findings suggest that the approach pursued by PPR was effective, as the subproject
investments not only contributed to improve NRM on-farm, but also had a positive impact on the
physical and financial performance of individual farm operations. Further, all of the final batch
of water-related subprojects will receive continued TA under the recently-approved lending
operation (DACC) ensuring adequate O&M assistance beyond PPR.

4.3     Finally, positive results from the public investments supported by PPR have encouraged
MGAP to adopt or mainstream many of its innovative instruments and methodologies into their
policies and operational programs, as well as for the National Directorate for the Environment
(DINAMA) to collaboratively support conservation efforts in/around protected areas.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank provided a high level of support to MGAP during the entire project preparation
process through a qualified and multidisciplinary team of specialists, including successfully
obtaining blended financial resources from the GEF. Continuity in Task Team leadership also
helped ensure that experience and lessons learned from prior Bank interventions in Uruguay,
including the PRENADER project (1994-2002, P008173) and the Uruguay: the Rural Sector and
Natural Resources Report (No. 24409-UR, 2002), were fully incorporated into PPR’s technical,
fiduciary, and operational design.

5.1.2 The Bank team provided important post-appraisal support to assist incoming MGAP
authorities to develop project ownership and define mutually agreeable targets to be used by the
project M&E unit to monitor project performance. As a result of the aforementioned dramatic
political change shortly after appraisal, the Bank engaged in a constructive dialogue with the new
authorities, which resulted in an extended processing of the project (9 months between appraisal
and negotiations). However, this was essential in order to successfully develop/instill project
ownership by the new MGAP authorities, and to make the necessary operational adjustments to
accommodate the priorities of the new administration overall planned project activities. The
success of this effort was ratified by the Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP-2)
conducted by the Bank’s internal Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in June 2010. This same
report also addressed “Quality of Results Framework? and “Quality of Arrangements for M&E"
(see Annex 2, Appendix 2).

5.1.3 Balancing these positive factors and the cited QAG ratings, the excessive number and
complex nature/content of the PDO, GEO, KPIs, and IOIs during project design (as presented in
the PAD Main Text and Annex 3 Results Framework), particularly in terms of measurability and
lack of targets, negatively impacted quality at entry and required revision/consolidation at the
time of the MTR in order to more effectively measure project outputs and outcomes.
Furthermore, many of the KPIs and IOIs were more output-focused, as opposed to outcome
focused, and lacked indicators for adequately measuring economic viability of subprojects.

                                               17
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.4 Frequent and Effective Supervision. The Bank conducted 20 full supervision missions
with extensive field trips to assess implementation on the ground, meet beneficiaries,
decentralized project staff, and other key stakeholders. Aide Memoires were detailed and
analytical, covering key issues and providing guidance to MGAP and the PEU through clear and
constructive recommendations. Then Bank team provided flexible and responsive assistance to
address unforeseen circumstances, in particular, recurrent droughts.

5.1.5 Continued Bank Portfolio Activities. Complementing supervision activities, in 2010 the
Bank actively collaborated with MGAP/PEU in drafting a AAA on “Family Farming?
(Title: Uruguay - Family Agriculture Development, Report No. 55220-UY, June 20, 2010). This
AAA highlighted the need for an integrated and inclusive agricultural development strategy
which technical and financial assistance is specifically targeted to “family farmers? to promote
the adoption of new technologies and sustainable agro-environmental production practices. The
report improved the Bank’s supervisory role, helped lay the groundwork for the current lending
operation (DACC), and provided important information that DGDR continues to use at present.
Bank Management (local Representative, the SMU, and the CMU) support also assisted the
Bank team in high-level dialogue with MGAP and Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to
address project issues, as well as facilitate numerous field visits by Bank managers to see project
activities and meet with beneficiaries. In addition, the Bank team worked with the CMU on an
innovative initiative to develop/establish the “UY Green Growth Cluster? which created a forum
for cross-sector collaboration between related Bank projects/initiatives/task teams.

5.1.6 Knowledge Events. Bank team support to MGAP was highlighted through several
knowledge events carried out in conjunction with PPR, including the GEF Assembly (June 2010),
a highly successful CGIAR/GCARD event (2012), and a “South-South? Exchange Program
event held in Colonia (June 2012) which focused on efficient water management in rural areas
and highlighted the on-farm achievements of PPR. This “South-South? event included 70
participants from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay and underscored the
importance of fluent communication and opportunities for exchanges on water-related issues
among individuals and institutions within the region.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.7 This rating acknowledges that Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry was
Moderately Satisfactory, primarily due to design-related challenges during preparation related to
the Results Framework indicators and targets. However Bank supervision and support to the
borrower/client during implementation was carried out in a Satisfactory manner to implement an
innovative, complex, and widely-recognized project, which has led to continued Bank portfolio
activities and effective dialogue with an innovation-friendly client.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 During preparation, MGAP (under the previous administration) designated the General
Office for Renewable Natural Resources (or RENARE, by its Spanish acronym) as the
Directorate within MGAP responsible for overall project implementation (consistent with the
PRENADER project). When the new administration took office, however, RENARE
experienced a major internal restructuring process that limited its capacity to effectively fulfill its
role as implementing agency of the project. Although this situation contributed to the slow start
of PPR, this institutional and operational vacuum was eventually addressed by the: (i) active
involvement of MGAP’s Vice-Minister, designated by the Minister as the institutional focal
point for PPR; and (ii) decision to strengthen the PEU in order to perform technical and
operational functions (especially those related to the subproject cycle). Institutional functions
were subsequently revised further with the creation of DGDR in 2009, designated to coordinate
all MGAP programs involving support to “family farmers,? including PPR. These changes,
although conceptually sound, had an impact on project implementation due to the initial staffing
and budgetary limitations of the newly established DGDR, which resulted in the need for PEU
staff to combine project duties with institutional tasks, particularly affecting the performance of
the PEU’s decentralized staff.

5.2.2 Despite these institutional restructurings, not uncommon with changes of political
administrations, actual GOU counterpart contributions to the project were 148 percent of
projected amounts (from appraisal). This included critical support by the MEF to make
budgetary adjustments to compensate for initial low financial performance within Uruguay’s
rigid 5-year fixed budget system.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.3 The commitment, dedication, and enthusiasm of PEU team members towards the
successful administration and execution of the project were notable. Initial project
implementation progress was very slow, however, due to several factors: lack of administrative
experience of the incoming administration; need to recruit and train PEU team; operational
complexity of blending loan and GEF grant resources (including incorporation of biodiversity
within MGAP); delays caused by austerity measures disallowing the development and launch of
the originally planned M&E system; and the unexpectedly long period required to initiate the
flow of subprojects. As a result, during the first 12 months, the project’s physical and financial
progress was minimal. Following this somewhat disappointing start, the efforts of PEU
management and staff to promote PPR in rural areas throughout the country began showing
encouraging results, and demand for subprojects by project beneficiaries gradually increased.
Through this process, an acceptable and balanced rate of implementation was reached in Year 2
and effectively sustained throughout the life of the project. This also included a comprehensive
and well-prepared BCR, beneficiary survey, and Sustainability Assessment at project closure.




                                                  19
5.2.4 Led by a committed Director, the PEU had a well-qualified team of technical and
administrative professionals, including centralized and decentralized staffing structure to perform
all functions related to (i) promoting PPR’s NRM and biodiversity objectives in rural areas; (ii)
supporting and supervising the network of private TA providers that assisted beneficiaries in
preparing and implementing subprojects; (iii) carrying out effective training, outreach, and
communication strategies/programs; (iv) performing initial screening and assessment of
subproject proposals; (v) linking PPR with local institutions and farmer organizations; and (vi)
organizing project-sponsored events such as training, technical seminars, and field trips.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.5 Overall, a large part of the project’s success is attributable to the effective
implementation, though delayed at first, by the PEU and support received through the life of the
project from MGAP (and other GOU entities).8 This success has been further manifested through
the recently-launched DACC operation promoting further institutional collaboration and
mainstreaming of “climate-smart? agriculture, building on the successes of PPR.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1    The most important lessons learned from this project are:
     A transparent demand-driven approach is critical to success of NRM projects. As
       the previous PRENADER project worked on a supply-driven basis, which led to some
       unsuccessful outcomes in beneficiaries’ adherence to project concept and mechanisms,
       PPR promoted a demand-driven approach which helped ensure a better “sense of
       ownership,? addressing real on-farm needs, and more cost-effective/sustainable
       investments;
     Integrating NRM and Biodiversity. The integration of NRM and biodiversity within the
       structure and mentality of a traditionally structured, production-oriented Ministry of
       Agriculture was a key factor in promoting “green growth? in the agricultural sector;
     Output vs. Outcome Indicators and Targets. Ex-post reviews highlighted the
       importance of KPIs with outcome-focused indicators and targets, and IOIs with output-
       focused indicators and targets to more effectively measure project impacts. Furthermore,
       KPIs and IOIs should be rationally and substantively consistent with project objectives;
     Detailed Design of the Subproject Cycle. Within a broad-based demand-driven
       approach, the design and operational aspects of the subproject cycle, as well as the
       frequency/timing/budget of calls for proposals should be carefully addressed during
       preparation and validated during the initial stages of project implementation to avoid
       credibility issues and frustration within the beneficiary community when delays occur or
       expectations are not met;
     Climate Change Adaptation Measures. In non-irrigated areas or production systems,
       climate variability and beneficiary vulnerability should be taken into consideration at
       project design, as the benefits accrued by producers from project-financed investments
       can be easily lost as a result of droughts or other climate related adversities;


8
  One are of missed opportunity for greater impact on integrating biodiversity more fully throughout relevant government ministries was the
limited participation and cooperation of DINAMA in project activities.

                                                                      20
         Effective Dissemination Strategy. In order to maximize the dissemination, visibility and
          perception of project actions and results, the implementation of PPR demonstrated the
          importance of including, within the structure of the PEU, a communications team staffed
          by specialized professionals, responsible for the design and implementation of a
          communication plan suited to the features and needs of the project.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1.    Commenting on the Bank’s draft ICR (see Annex 7, Appendix 1 with official
letter/comments from Borrower/Implementing Agency), the Borrower provided the following
comments/issues (in summary):

7.2     Borrower Summary Comments/Issues: The ICR is well-prepared, adequately
demonstrates project achievements, and reflects well the findings/information documented in the
BCR. However, the Borrower found the performance ratings regarding Bank and Borrower
performance, particularly Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality-at-Entry, were lower than
anticipated by the Borrower given the project’s significant achievements and impacts regarding
NRM, biodiversity conservation, and improvement in the quality of life for family farmers in
Uruguay. The Implementing Agency (MGAP) found the project to be highly satisfactory and felt
the justifications for the ICR performance ratings put undue emphasis on the perceived
limitations of the indicators and M&E system used. In the Borrower’s opinion, these restrictions
did not have a significant impact on the implementation and results of the project. On the
contrary, Borrower found the revision process to the project indicators and M&E system, which
occurred after project launch and at MTR, were positive contributions by the Bank and PEU
team which showed sensitivity to changes involving the change in government in 2005, as well
as reflected the adaptive approach utilized during implementation and which contributed in part
to the overall successful implementation and performance of the project.

7.3     Team Response: The team explained in the ICR review meeting9 held with the Borrower
the rationale used for the assigned ratings. In summary, and as outlined in the appropriate
sections of the ICR, the Moderately Satisfactory rating for Bank Performance in Ensuring
Quality at Entry primarily reflects the initially complex/onerous design of the PAD Results
Framework and Monitoring Matrix, including an excessive number of both KPIs and IOIs
without initial targets, and which required revisions for improvement. Notwithstanding, the
Satisfactory rating given for Bank Performance in Quality of Supervision, in part, reflects the
discussed adaptive approach by both the Bank team and PEU.

beneficiary contribution to total project costs. Additionally, the appraisal estimation of beneficiaries’ contributions included in-
kind family labor valued at market prices, whereas the final reported beneficiaries’ contributions did not account for most
“family-labor? in-kind costs, as most producers found it difficult to estimate the market value of family labor and did not keep

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1     PPR provided technical and financial assistance to 4,667 small and medium-sized
livestock producers and farmers to improve natural resources and biodiversity conservation, as
well as to ensure medium to long-term sustainability of livestock and crop production. It also
strengthened 658 producer groups. As a result of project activities, over 881,882 hectares
benefited from improved NRM, thus contributing to the conservation of the natural resource base
and the long term sustainability of agricultural development in the country. See “Indicators
Summary Table? at end of this Annex for details.

2.2    PPR provided technical and financial assistance on a matching grant basis for 5,300
subprojects. One of the main challenges of PPR was to ensure that the supported subprojects
were integrated, in the sense of combining measures enhancing NRM and biodiversity
conservation. It is important to note that GEF resources supported only activities directly linked
with biodiversity conservation.

2.3    PPR has been highly effective, as exemplified by the number of direct and indirect
beneficiaries reached (as reported in the BCR) of 28,000 direct beneficiaries (meaning producers
and their families) and 150,000 indirect beneficiaries (including everyone who has taken part in
the project activities, including training courses, workshops, field work, rural schools,
researches, institutional strengthening, etc). PPR also promoted private sector participation
through capacity building and the provision of production support services, particularly TA to
producers, training events, and extension materials and publications. Quality training was
delivered to farmers and producer organizations in several technical areas. The technicians also
received good quality training in natural resources and biodiversity management and now have
appropriate knowledge to replicate such assistance services. PPR carried out a total series of 78
capacity building events in different thematic areas and a total of 2,615 technicians were trained.

2.4     Strong linkages were established between project beneficiaries and the private and public
sectors operating in the agriculture sector. Some 56 cooperation agreements were signed with
local and national organizations to promote government services to enhance the integrated
management of natural resources and biodiversity, all of which are expected to enhance the
sustainability of the investments financed by PPR.

2.5    Activities under Component 1, Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management,
accounted for the majority of resources invested (82.6 percent), compared to Component 2 Pilot
Areas (5.2 percent); Component 3 Institutional Strengthening and Training (3.3 percent); and
Component 4 Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (8.8 percent). Through activities
under Component 1, PPR financed over 5,000 demand-driven subprojects promoting integrated
NRM and biodiversity conservation practices. Subprojects were classified into four sub-
components: (i) Soil and water; (ii) Water use; (iii) Management of natural pastures; and (iv)
Conservation of Biodiversity. Table 2 shows the most demanded activities under each
subcomponent as well as the resources released.

2.9    Other significant achievements (expanded points as summarized in section 3.2 of the
main text) include:

    PPR engaged with a total of 658 producer organizations (through endorsing individual
     beneficiaries’ proposals)
    Of the 5,300 subprojects implemented, 1,308 were targeted specifically to promote
     biodiversity conservation practices, and 627 were implemented in extensive livestock
     operations applying innovative approaches blending support to biodiversity-specific
     investments with NRM practices
    Completion of comprehensive multidisciplinary Eco-regional Planning Study of the
     country’s main natural habitats
    Implementation of 47 subprojects aimed at promoting ecotourism, which not only allowed
     small and medium farmers to establish rural tourism operations but also raised awareness
    Most significant biodiversity conservation and other environmental impacts from project
     activities:
         o Regeneration and improved management of natural pastures
         o Enhanced soil quality, primarily through better retention of organic material and
             nutrients, as well as carbon storage
         o Increased accessibility to water year-round and water quality
         o Recuperation of native forest and promotion of alternatives to sustainable uses of
             native flora and fauna
         o Establishment of conservation areas on farms to protect particular species or key sites
             of high biodiversity, e.g. conservation measures of wild deer populations, grassland
             birds, feathery palms (Butia capitata), and numerous protected areas for regeneration
             of degraded environments in various parts of the country
         o Control of invasive alien flora and fauna species, affecting both biodiversity and
             sustainable production. Species identified as particularly threatening were privet,
             gleditsia, gorse and blackberry, all of which were mitigated/controlled on important
             farm areas
         o Protection of “Riparian areas? of high biodiversity that provide various ecosystem
             services such as filtering pollutants, nutrient uptake in plant biomass, as well as
             habitat and food for many animal groups
    Total of 6 Geographic Information System (GIS) 10 layers were systematized and
     incorporated into existing GIS within MGAP, through over 70 individual layers and 210
     maps. The themes include: (i) Biodiversity Database, (ii) Eco-regional maps, (iii)

   Conservation protection measures promoted under PPR provided direct or indirect
    improvements to the conservation of 243 native species (83 fauna, 160 flora), including 79
    listed by IUCN’s Red List, 18 by CITES, and 51 defined as priority species by the National
    System of Protected Areas (SNAP)

2.10 Component 1: Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management (estimated total cost
at time of appraisal US$87.63 million, including US$25.17 million IBRD financing and US$4.97
million GEF resources) financed technical and financial assistance to individual producers and/or
groups for facilitating activities targeting integrated management of natural resources and
biodiversity conservation through environmentally, economically and financially sustainable
practices. The implementation of this component was demand-driven. GEF resources supported
mainstreaming demand for biodiversity initiatives in priority ecosystems, and supported
activities directly related to the conservation of biological diversity, whether included as an
integral part of the subprojects or that constituted the entire subproject proposal in itself.

       PPR provided technical and financial assistance on a matching grant basis for 5,300
        subprojects, directly benefiting 4,667 small and medium-sized farmers and livestock
        producers, to improve natural resources and biodiversity conservation, as well as to
        ensure medium to long-term sustainability of livestock and crop production.
   881,882 hectares of land benefited from farmers’ adoption of project-supported improved
    NRM practices/systems, thus contributing to the conservation of the natural resource base
    and the long term sustainability of agricultural development
   PPR led to improved farmer income, primarily due to increased productivity in dairy,
    livestock, and agricultural systems (see Annex 3)
   PPR led to significantly reduced losses during the severe droughts faced by Uruguayan
    farmers in 2008 and 2010, potentially exceeding US$30 million (see Annex 3 for details)
        o Addressing recurrent water shortages during dry summer months, mainly affecting
            family livestock producers, PPR improved the traditional technology of spring
            rainfall harvesting through co-financing some 1,600 small temporary reservoirs
            (tajamares)
        o Developing a technological package for the improved design, construction, and
            management of tajamares (including specifications for location/dimensions, fencing,
            water distribution, planting of native species for shade, and additional fencing for
            improved management of native grasslands)
   Small-holder farmers/producers were overwhelmingly the largest category of project
    beneficiaries, comprising 86 percent of subproject activities, with medium-sized with 13
    percent and large-sized 1 percent
   Project beneficiaries constituted over 10 percent of family farming households in Uruguay

2.11    PPR provided financial and TA to promote specifically:

        i) Livestock systems: adoption of improved NRM emphasis on the improvement of
        natural pastures and biodiversity. Specifically, this included investments in fencing, water
        supply systems for livestock and irrigation systems (used for strategic production of

                                                27
summer forage), soil improvement measures, management/maintenance of natural
grasslands, establishment of natural shelters, preferably with native species. Specifically
in the Departments of Artigas, Salto, Paysandu, Rivera, Tacuarembó, Flores, Durazno,
Treinta y Tres, Maldonado and Rocha, Component 1 co-financed the construction, repair,
and/or cleaning of embankments, fencing, well construction, glens cleaning channels,
troughs, distribution pipes, mills, pumps, and tanks.

ii) Dairy production systems: adoption of improved management of animal
excrement/effluent and/or holding pens and feeding stalls; new or improved water
sources; including distribution, to ensure quality pasture and soil management; improved
tillage rotational feeding practices to prevent erosion and improve soil quality;
systematization of internal roads in order to avoid or mitigate soil erosion; incorporation
of wetlands based on native macrophytes for wastewater treatment.

iii) Horticulture and fruit production systems: substitution of Methyl Bromide, in
greenhouses, adoption of improved soil management through conservation tillage and
rotational practices; direct planting/seeding; erosion control practices, including land
leveling for improved soil and water conservation, as well as reducing contamination of
water sources and improved physical and chemical properties of soils.

iv) Irrigated farming systems: adoption of NRM practices on irrigated areas; irrigation
technology to improve efficiency of water use; investments to expand the diversification
of high value crops, such as vegetables and fruits; and investments to consolidate and
expand the areas of irrigated agriculture developed by the PRENADER.

v) All production/farming systems: priority was given to promote the environmentally
sound management of agrochemicals, including the responsible/safe disposal of
containers.

vi) Integrated biodiversity conservation: In all types of production systems, activities
were piloted or given grant funding which incorporated the productive use and
conservation of biodiversity in rural areas. Special emphasis was placed on activities
aimed at improving rural practices to promote increased species populations, increasing
and maintaining key habitats for conservation of biological diversity in the country,
increased private conservation areas of biodiversity, and increased income from
productive uses of biological diversity. Specifically, these measures included GEF
funding for:
 Incremental costs for the use, management and conservation of biological diversity of
    natural pastures
 Incremental costs for the registration of existing native forest lands by beneficiaries to
    help ensure the sustainable management of these forests in perpetuity
    Practices to promote sustainable yields of timber and native forest
 Sustainable management and conservation of native wildlife
 Practices for integrated livestock production/management on native grasslands and
    forest landscapes
 Eco-tourism

                                        28
         Initiatives to control growth of invasive alien flora species (i.e. privet, Gleditsia,
          gorse, blackberry) and fauna species (i.e. wild boar) that threaten both sustainable
          production as well as native biodiversity
         Artisanal fishing, including support for activities related to sustainable fishing
          practices and fisheries, including the consolidation of cooperatives’ initiatives
         Initiatives in aquaculture for incorporation of native fish species to promote
          diversification of production, as well as increased supply of protein options in rural
          areas

      vii) Renewable energy. As pilot/demonstrating activities in different production systems,
      initiatives promoted adoption of renewable energy, including biogas digestors, windmills
      for water pumping, solar power, and micro–hydro.

2.13 Component 2: Establishment of Pilot Areas (estimated total cost US$1.50 million, 100
percent GEF-financed): implementation of pilot demonstrations of sustainable use of natural
resources and biodiversity in key micro-watersheds.

2.14 The original project plan was to organize demonstration projects in 10 priority areas
selected during the project preparation phase. Execution of this component, however, proved

                                                31
problematic initially. After adjustments made around the time of MTR, the project successfully
implemented subprojects and other pilot activities in all priority areas, with specific
demonstration activities held in three specific cases identified as priority areas: Arerunguá,
Laureles, and Lake Castillos.

2.15 Furthermore, GEF-financed activities supported many innovative (demand-driven)
approaches for mainstreaming biodiversity in the productive sector, for example, a pilot
experience now gaining wider interest as an additional income source for producers/landowners
is the collection and sale of fuel wood collected from invasive species. The practice was financed
by PPR and now has become cost-effective without subsidies (PPR produced a video now widely
disseminated).

2.16 Component 3: Support Services (estimated total cost US$3.86 million, including
US$2.87 million IBRD financing and US$0.29 million GEF resources): training to farmers,
institutional strengthening of local and central authorities (through improved GIS and studies),
studies and applied research, and specialized training for technical staff providing TA to farmers.

2.17 Key activities carried out under Component 3 include the following:
 PPR carried out a total series of 78 capacity building events in relevant thematic areas and
   trained a total of 2,615 technicians. Through these events/trainings, PPR reached an
   estimated 28,000 direct beneficiaries (producers and their families) and 150,000 indirect
   beneficiaries (including everyone who has taken part in the project activities, including
   training courses, workshops, field work, rural schools, researches, institutional strengthening,
   etc).
 PPR promoted private sector participation through capacity building and the provision of
   production support services, particularly TA to producers, training events, and extension
   materials and publications.
 Substantial contribution to MGAP’s efforts to increase overall knowledge and understanding
   of biodiversity conservation at all levels (MGAP staff, public central and local institutions,
   farmer organizations, producers, private extension and TA providers, rural teachers and
   students, and general public) through a significant number of knowledge products developed
   or promoted by PPR, including publications, manuals, studies, videos, brochures, webpage,
   local and international conferences and seminars, etc. (see Annex 9 for details).
 Some 56 cooperation agreements (convenios) were signed with local and national
   agricultural organizations to promote government services to enhance the integrated
   management of natural resources and biodiversity conservation in the sector, all of which are
   expected to enhance the sustainability of the investments financed by PPR.
 Substantial contribution to MGAP’s efforts to increase overall knowledge and understanding
   of NRM and agro-environmental practices at all levels (MGAP staff, public central and local
   institutions, farmer organizations, producers, private extension and TA providers, rural
   teachers and students, and general public) through a substantial number of knowledge
   products developed or promoted by PPR (technical publications, manuals, studies, videos,
   brochures, webpage, local and international conferences and seminars, etc.). See Annex 9 for
   details.

2.18 An important element of Component 3 was the creation of the Institutional Liaison Unit
within the PEU. This Unit worked to promote participation at the local level and provided
training, in close coordination with the Communications Unit of the PEU. The project
intervention model, using farming subprojects which stimulate group formation and have
institutional backing, was crucial. Among other functions, the groups served as forums for
producer-to-producer learning, in the same way as institutional backing was a means of
publicizing the project and of recognizing the role of organizations in the territory.

2.19   The Institutional Liaison Unit promoted activities such as:

       (a) Specialized training for professionals providing TA to producers for the design and
       execution of subprojects;

       (b) Training of producers on innovative ways of conserving natural resources and
       biodiversity in the productive sector. One of the innovative instruments supported by
       PPR (beginning in 2008) was Participatory Outreach Workshops. These workshops were
       held usually on producers’ farmland and with the participation and involvement of
       various stakeholders. The workshops began by identifying problems and needs of
       “family farmers? at the local level. Producers in the area and in other areas with similar
       production systems were also invited to participate actively in each workshop, as well as
       relevant extensionists, TA providers, producer organizations, and local authorities. The
       methodology used in these workshops consisted of stakeholder participation, a
       combination of practical, empirical, and scientific knowledge geared to problem-solving
       and specific needs, and an efficient multi-media approach incorporating various strategies
       and communication technologies for knowledge-sharing.

2.20 PPR also funded studies and applied research designed to improve the framework of
policies for NRM and to develop new techniques in areas posing special difficulties, with a focus
on achieving corresponding environmental benefits. Thus special emphasis was placed on
prevention of soil erosion and on the use and responsible management of pesticides.

2.21 The system of working agreements (convenios) were also valuable in publicizing project
proposals and facilitating the strategy of enhanced institutional coordination to ensure that NRM
remained on the agenda of local organizations. Although there were various types of convenios,
their focus was on NRM and biodiversity conservation awareness-raising and training in these
issues, as well as to support the infrastructure needed for an integrated approach. The training
made it possible to identify and address future needs, provide technical resources required, as
well as develop the capacity to help ensure sustainability of project activities following project
closure.

2.22 Component 4: Project Executing Unit (total cost US$2.61 million, including US$0.25
million of GEF resources) financed the Project Executing Unit (PEU), responsible for overall
project implementation and the M&E System.

2.23 PPR’s success can be in large part attributed to the commitment, dedication, and
enthusiasm of the PEU team members towards the successful execution and administration of the

                                               33
project. As mentioned in the main text, although initial implementation progress of the project
was very slow during the first 12 months with regards to the project’s physical and financial
progress, mostly due to necessary set-up of the PEU and needed training, the PEU was able to
arrive at an acceptable and balanced rate of implementation by Year 2 and effectively sustained
throughout the life of the project. This also included a comprehensive and well-prepared BCR,
beneficiary survey, and sustainability study at project closure.

2.24 Initial challenges causing the delay at project launch were due to several factors,
including the lack of administrative experience of the incoming administration; the need to
recruit and train the entire implementation team that would staff the PEU; the operational
complexity of blending loan and GEF grant resources (including incorporation of biodiversity
within MGAP); delays caused by austerity measures disallowing the development and launch of
the originally planned M&E system; and the unexpectedly long period required to initiate the
flow of subprojects. Following this somewhat disappointing start, the efforts of PEU
management and staff to promote PPR in rural areas throughout the country began showing
encouraging results, and demand for subprojects by project beneficiaries gradually increased.

2.25 Led by a charismatic Director, the PEU became a well-qualified team of technical and
administrative professionals. In addition to the valuable role of the PEU members in
implementing key project aspects such as training, communications, and administration, a key
positive feature of the PEU was the synergy created through centralized and decentralized
staffing structure being able to perform all functions on-the-ground throughout the country
related to the subproject cycle. Despite their initial lack of technical and operational experience,
the decentralized team of young professionals recruited to coordinate project activities in the
country’s 19 Departments was instrumental in the difficult task of promoting PPR’s NRM and
biodiversity objectives in rural areas; supporting and supervising the network of private TA
providers that assisted beneficiaries in preparing and implementing subprojects; performing the
initial screening and assessment of subproject proposals; linking PPR with local institutions and
farmer organizations; and organizing project-sponsored events such as training, technical
seminars, and field trips.

2.26 More specifically, the successful implementation of PPR by the PEU was strongly linked
to: (i) effective dedication and outputs from the PEU and the network of regional TA providers;
(ii) the training program; (iii) outreach and communication strategy; (iv) support to farmer
organizations; and (iv) strong support from MGAP’s authorities to the administrative and
managerial requirements of the PEU.

2.27 In addition to regularly monitoring and evaluating project indicators, providing ongoing
feedback and follow-up reporting, the project’s M&E Unit was also responsible for the design
and application of specific systems for measuring environmental impacts resulting from
implementation of subprojects. These systems provided objective findings regarding the impacts
of subprojects on producers’ farms, permitting subsequent analysis and interpretation of the
environmental impact of PPR during its execution.

2.28 In conjunction with the Sustainability Assessment, a Beneficiary Satisfaction Survey was
also conducted by the PEU (see Annex 5). Its sample size and methodology were different: the

                                                34
goal was to measure the level of satisfaction of beneficiary producers and to ascertain their
attitude towards conservation practices. The study concluded that beneficiaries generally had a
very positive view of the project. In addition, a large majority of beneficiaries agreed that PPR
had improved their production, their income and their quality of life.

2.29 With regard to training and workshops with producers, 56 percent of beneficiary
producers participated in a training activity, of which 95 percent indicated that they found these
activities “very useful? or “useful? (64 percent and 31 percent respectively).

Quality of Design and Project Launch: “This is a thoughtfully designed project introducing
new concepts in reaching out to smallholder farmers. The PAD provides a very good overview of
sector issues and shows the Bank’s familiarity with the agricultural sector after many years of
engagement. Largely neglected by previous [Government] policy, smallholder farmers are a
focal point of attention of the current [Government], which came into office at a time when the
project was ready for Board presentation. However, to gain ownership by the new
administration, LCR management decided to delay Board approval by one year, a wise decision
with hindsight. The Bank’s ‘pause’ during processing of the project to enable secure ownership
by a new [Government] Administration highlights the importance of this practice for future
operations, when a similar situation arises.?

more than outcomes. However, the project performance indicators are reflective of a project that
is meeting many, and surpassing some, of its objectives. Yet the qualitative progress assessment
focus on outcome and the M&E, once fully operational, will do so too. Also, various analytical

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Summary of Project benefits and costs in the ICR

3.1     Background: Through financing from the World Bank (US$ 30.0 million) and a grant
from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) (US$ 7.0 million), the Ministry of Livestock,
Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP, in Spanish abbreviations) implemented from 2005 to 2012 the
Integrated Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management Project (locally known as Proyecto
Produccion Responsable, or PPR). PPR focused on the adoption of economically and
environmentally-viable, integrated production systems within a context of holistic ecosystem and
NRM, while mainstreaming biodiversity.

3.2     Overall impacts of the project: Based on the subprojects analyzed in each productive
system, the positive economic results and environmental impacts are consistent with the initial
project hypotheses and the basic strategic principle of promoting “win-win? technologies that
would combine public and private environmental benefits with incremental financial returns to
the beneficiaries. As a result of the investments financed by PPR, the main economic benefits
could be summarized as improved farmer income (primarily due to increased productivity), and
reduced losses during the severe droughts faced by Uruguayan farmers in the summer months of
2008 and 2010.

3.3     With regard to positive environmental impacts the important contribution to natural
resources and biodiversity preservation is notable, from the regeneration of natural pastures
associated with productive subprojects to enhanced soil erosion prevention, improved soil quality
(primarily through better retention of organic material and nutrients, and indirectly through
carbon storage), improved accessibility to water year-round, water quality, and the efficient use
of water. Other major impacts have been the restoration of native forest, recuperation of bio-
diverse habitats, and ecosystem services. From a biodiversity perspective, PPR has enhanced the
geographic configuration that maintains the mosaic nature of Uruguay’s original habitats and
restoring biological globally-significant areas through a diversified rural landscape.

3.4     Most importantly, PPR led to important long-term behavioral changes within Uruguay’s
livestock and agricultural sectors (project beneficiaries constituted over 10 percent of the entire
farming population, and 25 percent of the universe of “family farmers?) towards the adoption of
agro-environmental practices. More specifically, the incorporation/mainstreaming of natural
resource management and biodiversity conservation in production systems, as well as national
agricultural institutions/organizations more fully mainstreaming these responsible practices into
their agendas. In addition, farmers’ capacity to adapt to the effects of climate variability has been
strengthened due to project activities.

3.5    Project costs and financing: As shown in Annex 1, total project cost was US$47.59
million, approximately 50 percent of the appraisal estimate. The IBRD loan and GEF grant
contributed US$30 million and US$7 million, respectively. The GOU counterpart funds
contribution was US$4.6 million, 154 percent of the original estimate of US$3.0 million. The
contributions from beneficiaries reached US$6 million, only 11 percent of the original estimates
of US$56.0 million. One reason for this unusually high estimate was the initial inclusion of

                                                 41
primarily medium and large farming operations as the targeted beneficiaries in the original
project design (particularly rice farmers), which would contribute larger proportions of total
subproject costs. However, as previously explained, the change in government shortly after
appraisal resulted in a shift in project focus from medium and large farming operations to the
category of “family farmers? comprised of small and medium-sized producers. The considerable
difference in subproject co-financing levels for each type of farmer (20 percent for small farmers
and 60-80 percent for large farmers) translated into the overall reduction in beneficiary
contribution to total project costs. Additionally, the appraisal estimation of beneficiaries’
contributions included in-kind family labor valued at market prices, whereas the final reported
beneficiaries’ contributions did not account for most “family-labor? in-kind costs, as most
producers found it difficult to estimate the market value of family labor and did not keep records.

3.6    Small-scale producers received financing equivalent to 80 percent of the total subproject
costs while medium-scale producers received 60 percent. For the large farmers, the original
subsidy was 20 percent but increased to 40 percent of the total subproject costs to encourage the
presentation of more biodiversity conservation proposals. Operational costs were kept low
primarily because mobilization of project-related staff and consultants was minimized through
contracting local project staff and TA providers, who conducted most training directly on the
farm sites, which expanded both the Ministry’s technical capacity and reach. The technicians’
contributions included: direct technical in-field support, systematization of information,
beneficiary training, and dissemination/promotion. Project beneficiaries contributed to building
technical capacity as well through providing new ideas, manpower, family labor and the above-
mentioned subproject cost-sharing resources.

B. Ex-ante Economic and Financial Analysis in the PAD

3.7     The economic and financial analysis carried out during project preparation, as presented
in the PAD, was based on a sample of investment subprojects expected to be demanded by
beneficiaries, following the experience of the predecessor PRENADER13 project. The impact of
these investments on natural resources and biodiversity management, agricultural productivity,
and farmers’ incomes was analyzed using farm models, illustrating the most common production
systems used by producers and situations in which biodiversity was mainstreamed into farmers’
investment decisions. The PAD economic and financial analysis included twenty (20) illustrative
farm models which consisted of:

     The Natural Resources Management and Irrigation Development Project (PRENADER), World Bank Loan No. 3697-UR, P008173

                                                                     42
          Traditional rice/livestock systems
          Small and large livestock producers with/without pasture
          Livestock production (full cycle) with/without irrigation
          Livestock/crops with pastures
          Livestock/crops with pastures and irrigation
          Livestock/crops without pastures
          Small and medium dairy farmers with/without irrigation
          Horticulture
          Fruits
          Vineyard with irrigation
          Citrus with irrigation

3.8     The economic and financial return calculations presented in the analysis included the cost
of incremental on-farm productive investments and recurrent expenditures related to the adoption
of practices to be promoted under PPR. The estimated overall economic rate of return of the
project was estimated at about 22.5 percent. As expected, given the level of financial incentive
provided, the selected farm models showed relatively high financial rates of return (> 25
percent). Input and output prices were assumed constant, as was the real exchange rate,
throughout the 20-year time horizon used in the financial analysis. The discount rate used was 10
percent.

C. Ex-post Analysis

Summary Findings

3.9     In the livestock subsector, the positive impacts from project activities on productive
parameters include improved livestock growth rates, reproductive coefficients, and overall herd
productivity. The project-funded activities improved the productivity of 344,240 livestock units
(LU) on average by 20kg per year resulting in an estimated total incremental income of US$20.9
million per year. In the dairy sector, PPR successfully promoted improved water management
through higher quality water distribution to milking cows, resulting in an estimated increase in
1.3 liters animal/day, which at current prices translates into an incremental income for project
beneficiaries of approximately US$33.5 million per year (based on analyzed increased milking
rates and current prices). PPR also contributed to the overall performance of the livestock
subsector by reducing the negative impact of severe summer droughts faced by Uruguay in 2008
and 2010. Although an exact quantification of avoided losses is not possible, as prior losses by
project beneficiaries were not recorded, MGAP’s Agricultural Planning and Policy Office
(OPYPA) estimated the direct losses of the livestock sector from the 2008 and 2010 droughts at
US$ 342 million.14 Project activities analyzed in the sample of horticulture subprojects were
estimated to lead to an average productivity increase of about 15 percent, as well as anticipated
output sustainability over time. There was an estimated 30 percent decrease in crop phyto-


14
 Assuming that only 10% of the country’s livestock farmers became more resilient as a result of project activities (conservative estimate), this
would represent a benefit (in terms of prevented losses) of over US$ 30 million (equivalent to IBRD loan which financed PPR).



                                                                      43
sanitary costs as a consequence of project interventions and an increase of final output prices and
marketing due to improved quality of the products. Overall, project activities were carried out on
1,328 hectares, or 57.7 percent of the total horticultural production operations in the country.
This accounts for almost one-third (29 percent) of total producers nationally.

Methodology of the Ex-post Analysis

3.10 The estimation of costs and benefits for the purposes of this ICR differs from the
approach followed by the PAD, due to a series of methodological and operational limitations
encountered when re-assessing the economic impact of PPR – particularly insufficient economic
data collection for individual subprojects during project implementation to allow for traditional
economic and financial analysis of subprojects or, alternatively, an ex-post cost-effectiveness
analysis. During the first call for proposals, subproject applications requested information
regarding gross income and variable costs per beneficiary household, but this information was
assessed as not reliable and difficult to collect, and therefore, the requirement to include it as part
of beneficiaries’ proposal submissions was removed by the PEU. As a result, there was also no
beneficiary production baseline established at the level of subprojects. Furthermore, the lack of
data to prepare a traditional economic and financial analysis can also be attributed to the nature
of project indicators being focused primarily on measuring outputs related to effective NRM and
biodiversity conservation practices, not on economic indicators that would facilitate the
preparation of a traditional economic and financial analysis.

3.11 PPR however did carry out a Sustainability Report and collected some other general
economic data during the latter half of implementation, upon which was based most of the
findings of this ex-post analysis. Also, MGAP with Bank assistance recently carried out a
detailed economic and financial analysis as part of the preparation of the PAD (Report No.
62277-UY, 17 October 2011) for the recently-launched Sustainable Management of Natural
Resources and Climate Change Project (P124181), or DACC. This analysis was based on a
sample of investment subprojects most likely to be demanded by beneficiaries and included
replications of some of the on-farm investments implemented under PPR. In the selected farm
models, economic return calculations included the cost of incremental on-farm productive
investment and recurrent expenditures for the adoption of sustainable agricultural production
systems promoted under DACC that would also increase farmers’ resilience to extreme climatic
events. The analysis of the sample of illustrative subprojects found them to be both economically
and financially viable with an economic IRR of 18 percent and high financial IRRs, ranging from
25 percent to 42 percent.

3.12 Given the above, the ex-post evaluation for PPR is focused primarily on illustrating the
direct economic impacts and environmental impacts of the subprojects most commonly
demanded by beneficiaries. Table 2 shows the relative importance of the main subproject types
in the overall project portfolio:

hypotheses of results expected With Project by subproject beneficiaries and consistent with the
initial project hypothesis.

BEEF PRODUCTION
3.14 A sample of 267 subprojects in two typical areas of livestock production were selected to
evaluate PPR interventions:

   (i) Area A: Central-Northern Uruguay, characterized by shallow soils (Basalto) where 123
   subprojects were monitored, comprising a total area of 51,172 hectares (average farm size:
   416 hectares)
   (ii) Area B: Eastern Uruguay characterized by shallow soils (Cristalino) where 144
   subprojects were monitored, comprising a total area of 41,520 hectares (average farm size:
   288 hectares)

Situation Without Project:

3.15 In the case of livestock grazing on natural pastures in Area A, the conventional system
over the years has resulted in significant environmental problems. The main problems (in order
of importance) were identified as: (i) degradation of natural pasture, (ii) depletion of water
resources in terms of availability and quality, (iii) lack of shade, (iv) soil degradation, (v) poor
native forest management, and (vi) weed control. In the sample of subprojects analyzed,
problems (i) and (ii) had occurred in over 90 percent of cases, and (iii) occurred in 58 percent of
cases analyzed (see Table 3 below).

3.16 Similarly, in the case of livestock grazing on natural pastures in Area B, the primary
environmental problems were consistent with those identified in Area A: degradation of natural
pasture (100 percent of cases analyzed), water quality and availability (72 percent), and lack of
shade (44 percent).

Situation With Project:

3.17 To mitigate the degradation of the natural pasture, interventions included: (i)
controlled grazing, (ii) division or subdivision of pastures into “paddocks,? (iii) measures for
improving quality of natural pasture, (iv) adjustments to stocking rates, and (v) weed control
(Table 4).

3.19 To mitigate water scarcity and declining water quality, the most widely demanded
intervention funded by PPR was installation of systems for water distribution in areas where
water availability is limited any time during the growing season. Activities included installation
of wells, pipes, distribution systems, troughs for livestock, automated mechanical refilling
systems (floats, buoys), storage tanks, rainwater tanks, pumping equipment, and retention ponds.


                                                 46

Table 6).

3.20 To mitigate other environmental problems, such as lack of shade and/or
mismanagement of native forest, various practices were put in place in both Area A and Area B.
Such interventions included: investments for registration and preparation of management plans
for native forests; regeneration of pastures with native trees species; and establishment of mixed
pastures, including silvo-pastoral initiatives.

3.21 To mitigate or reverse soil degradation, actions were taken to adjust stocking rates,
decreasing bare soil with species that cover the ground quickly, monitoring grass species,
presence of weeds, and limiting bare soil.

3.22 Positive Environmental impact: Practices resulted in: (i) recovered and improved
grasslands; (ii) improved conservation of biodiversity through protective practices; (iii) increase
in land cover and the diversity of species around retention ponds; (iv) improved quality and
increased availability of drinking water for cattle; and (v) increased awareness among producers
on the need for protection of water resources and biodiversity. With the use of innovative water
delivery systems for livestock grazing, PPR also improved use of organic fertilizers through
spraying of livestock manure on pastures. Among the most successful measures was found in
demonstrating the benefits of providing water to livestock in each paddock where they are
grazing. Providing shade was also important, not only for improving feed conversion
efficiencies, but to prevent cattle deaths due to heat stress. Heat stress has also been found to
reduce fertility in sheep and affect the well-being and weight of calves, and energy requirements
in livestock are reduced by shelters.

3.23 Economic impact: The positive environmental impacts from project activities are
expected to improve livestock growth rates, yields, and productivity. PPR estimated an average
increase of live-weight between 20 to 30 Kg per hectare per year (from a base of 90 Kg to 110
Kg per hectare per year). An increase of 10 percent was also estimated in pregnancy rates (from
70 to 80 percent) and an increase of 15 percent in stocking and reproduction rates. Investments
made in providing shade and shelter for livestock are expected to translate into an increase of 15
percent live-weight.

3.24 Furthermore, the BCR estimated that PPR achieved quality water storage and distribution
for 344,240 livestock units (LU) grazing on natural pastures, which ensured water supply for a
period of up to six months without rain. This estimation was based on real data from
implemented livestock subprojects. As PPR’s interventions took place on a total of 465,300
hectares of natural grassland, and considering the incremental increase in productivity of 20 Kg

                                                47
per hectare per year, and an average price of livestock unit of US$2.25 per Kg live-weight, the
incremental benefit would be an estimated US$20.9 million per year.

3.25 Other impacts: As a result of the severe drought suffered in 2008, PPR supported the
livestock sector through specific water supply interventions through the prioritization of
subprojects aimed at reducing the vulnerability of farmers to drought since 2007 and a call for
proposals specifically related to “Quality Water? and “Water for Animal Production? in 2009
and 2010, respectively. These specific programs benefited small and medium “family farmers?
by co-financing subprojects for wells, small on-farm rainfall harvesting reservoirs (“tajamares?),
irrigation systems, water supply and distribution systems The total investment in these specific
practices was US$9.9 million.

3.26 The GOU’s Agricultural Planning and Policy Office estimated (see Paolino et al. 2010)
that the direct losses of the livestock sector as a result of the 2008/2009 drought exceeded
US$342 million, broken down as follows: US$250 million in cows and steers not
sold/slaughtered, US$13 million due to increased mortality, US$59 million associated to the loss
of permanent artificial pastures, and US$20 million associated with the loss of forage.
Therefore, even if only 10 percent of livestock farmers became more resilient as a result of
project-financed adaptation measures, this would represent a benefit (in terms of prevented
losses) of over US$30 million (total amount of the IBRD loan).

DAIRY

3.27 A sample of 662 subprojects covering a total area of 73,481 hectares was observed to
characterize the dairy production system in the Without Project and With Project scenarios. Most
subprojects were located in the major milk producing areas (South-West and South) of the
country.

Situation Without Project:

3.28 The conventional dairy production system has created significant environmental
problems. In order of importance, the main problems identified in the sample of 662 subprojects
were: (i) water availability and quality (81 percent of the cases examined), both of which are
extremely important to guarantee proper milking procedures; (ii) management of effluent and
area surroundings (67 percent), which became increasingly important with rising sizes of
production units; and (iii) soil erosion and gullies (61 percent).

3.29 Other problems observed in the sample of subprojects analyzed related to natural pasture
management (33 percent of cases); access to dairy processing facilities (32 percent); use and
management of agro-chemicals (26 percent); and low forage persistency and grass management
(19 percent).

Situation With Project:

3.30 For the 662 subprojects analyzed, the total investment made by PPR was US$4.22
million in addition to TA of about US$1.5 million, paid by PPR for and on behalf of the
beneficiary. Beneficiaries contributed a total of US$1.4 million in counterpart contributions,
                                               48
which translated to about 19.7 percent of the total amount of approved subprojects. 94 percent of
farmers were small-sized and the remaining 6 percent medium-sized, with most farmers
members of a groups of five (on average).

3.31 The primary interventions used to address the problem of water quality and availability
were: (i) water distribution systems in different plots, implemented in approximately 54 percent
of the subprojects analyzed; (ii) new water sources (perforation) in 49 percent of the subprojects
analyzed; and (iii) retention ponds in just over a third (35 percent) of the cases analyzed. It is
important to highlight that in many subprojects, more than one of these interventions were
implemented simultaneously.

3.32 With regards to the management of effluents, 41 percent of the subprojects distributed
effluents on their fields as organic fertilizers. 38 percent of the subprojects installed a “flooring?
system in livestock holding pens for more effective effluent management/distribution. One-
quarter of the subprojects constructed lagoons (aerobic and anaerobic), and about 10 percent
used manual separation of solids, mainly in those production units with few milking cows.

3.33 With regards to soil erosion and gully mitigation, the main practices adopted were aimed
at reducing the overall loss of soil, including critical topsoil and nutrients. As a result, 85 percent
of subprojects implemented a variety of activities targeting soil conservation management, such
as the incorporation of zero tillage systems. Six out of ten subprojects (60 percent) established a
medium-term rotation, while nearly one in four farms (25 percent) increased pasture health and
longevity by including perennial grass and legumes in the pasture seed mixture. It is important to
emphasize that numerous subprojects incorporated more than one of these three interventions
mentioned.

3.34 Positive Environmental Impact: PPR expects to have had a positive environmental
impact through subprojects implemented in the dairy sector. Project interventions related to
water resulted in: (i) better distribution of livestock excrements on farms; (ii) decreased sanitary
problems on farms; (iii) reduced pasture degradation and increased longevity; (iv) decreased
likelihood of groundwater contamination; and (v) improved stream-water quality around the
farm. Soil conservation/management practices resulted in reduced erosion, mitigated gullies and
ditches areas, and increased soil quality in terms of organic matter (“soil carbon?).

3.35 Economic Impact: PPR had a positive economic impact on 156,140 hectares in the
country (representing 22 percent of the country’s dairy production) and ensured higher quality
water distribution for a dairy cows. Considering the average milk price to the producer of
US$0.43 per liter, and project activities resulting in an approximate increase in 1.3 liters per
animal, per day (assuming average production of 20 liters per animal, per day and 6.5 percent
increase in production due to project activities to improve water supply/distribution), this
presented an incremental income of about US$33.5 million per year.

HORTICULTURE SYSTEM

3.36 A sample of 119 subprojects affecting a total area of 1,328 hectares was taken to
characterize the typical horticulture system in the Without Project and With Project scenarios.
All these subprojects were located in the departments of Salto and Artigas (Bella Unión). The
                                                  49
profile of farms analyzed was mainly small-sized (9 out of 10 farms were small-sized and the
rest were medium-sized).



Situation Without Project:

3.37 An estimated 91 percent of the cases analyzed suffered from poor/degraded soil
management practices; 84 percent over-used agrochemicals; and 62 percent were inefficiently
using water for irrigation purposes.

Situation With Project:

3.38 Of the 119 subprojects analyzed, the total investment per subproject was US$11,400 (on
average), of which US$9,500 (on average) was financed by PPR. These figures do not include
TA provided by PPR, approximately US$2,835 per beneficiary on average. The total investment
reached US$1.7 million, of which PPR contributed US$1.47 million, including subproject and
TA costs. Beneficiaries contributed US$226,000 in counterpart contributions which translates
into 13.3 percent of the total amount. The duration of subprojects averaged about 2.5 years,
including technical advice. Some 97 percent of farmers were part of groups with an average of 8
members per group, mostly young farmers.

3.39 The main interventions/practices implemented to address problems related to poor soil
management practices were: (i) use of “green manure? in crop rotations (89 percent of total
subprojects analyzed); (ii) use of organic amendments (79 percent); (iii) farm infrastructure
improvements, including contouring, drains, sewers, and leveling (26 percent); and (iv) crop
rotation planning (15 percent). It should be noted that many subprojects included more than one
practice to mitigate and/or address the problem of poor soil management practices. With regards
to agrochemical use and management, nearly three-quarters of the subprojects implemented
several practices in the use and handling of chemicals in horticultural systems. Some 61 percent
of subprojects implemented environmentally-friendly practices such as “solarization? instead of
conventional soil sterilization practices typically utilizing harmful gases (e.g. methyl bromide).
Finally, about 36 percent of farms adopted the “Integrated Production Standards? promoted
under PPR, which cover all aspects of production for each crop from ecological, ethical, and
social aspects for responsible agricultural production to aspects of food quality and safety. The
standards are based on the use of natural resources, and regulating mechanisms to replace
potentially polluting inputs.
3.40 The third problem in order of importance shown in subprojects analyzed was the
inefficient use of water for irrigation. Some 62 percent of horticultural farms addressed this issue
by replacing old equipment and 44 percent of farms installed new drip irrigation systems. It is
worth noting that 11 percent of subprojects implemented required access to new water supply
through boreholes.

3.41 Positive Environmental Impact: Project interventions included the use of low or no-till
practices in crop rotation—usually best suited to horticultural production systems, as they
produce large quantities of dry matter. “Green manure? is particularly useful as it decomposes

                                                50
slowly and has a high capacity for recycling nutrients, allows for effective weed control, erosion
control, and sustainably increased production. Similarly, the use of organic amendments
increased the soil organic matter, stabilized soil aggregates, increased total porosity and soil
biological activity, and helped to improve soil nutrient content. Use of crop rotations methods
also reduced seed materials required, and helped to avoid crop health problems and soil nutrient
depletion during crop development.
3.42 Other positive environmental impacts which PPR expects to have contributed are:
reduced erosion, enhanced medium to long-term sustainability of soil quality, estimated 50
percent reduction in the quantity of agro-chemicals used, and decreased GHG emissions. With
regards to activities related to water management, PPR anticipates to have avoided water
contamination and increased responsible use of the resource.

3.43 Economic Impact: Project activities analyzed in the horticultural subprojects sample
were estimated to lead to an average productivity increase of 20 percent total gross production,
as well as anticipated output sustainability over time. There was an estimated 30 percent
decrease in crop sanitary costs as a consequence of project interventions, and an increase of final
output prices (+10 percent) and marketing due to improved quality of the products. With regards
to subprojects activities related to more efficient water use and/or distribution, PPR estimates an
increase of about 15 percent in crop productivity.

3.44 Overall, project activities benefitting horticultural production were carried out on a total
of 1,328 hectares, or 57.7 percent of total horticultural production operations in the country. This
accounts for 29 percent of total producers nationally (based on MGAP, Agricultural Statistical
Yearbook, 2008). Furthermore, 1,226 hectares (or 53.3 percent of total horticulture area
nationally) adopted improved management practices in use of agro-chemicals. Efficient
irrigation systems were installed on 823 hectares (or 36 percent of the total area for horticulture).
In the horticultural and fruit systems of the Metropolitan Region (Canelones), project activities
succeeded in reducing erosion and land degradation on 8,600 hectares and were able to establish
the responsible management of chemicals on 4,560 hectares.

BIODIVERSITY

Conservation of Natural Pastures

Situation Without Project:

3.45 The primary factors affecting sustainable use of natural pastures are the risk of
degradation and loss of species, related to continuous stocking, high stocking rates, and high
sheep/cattle ratios. Degradation signs are the increase of weeds and stoloniferous grasses adapted
to such grazing conditions and reduced frequency of bunch grasses, as well as a reduction in
number of species. Such changes in botanical composition result in an estimated 12 percent
reduction in annual forage production (Beretta et al., Uruguay May 2006).

Situation With Project:

3.46 Of the 5,300 subprojects approved under PPR, 1,523 subprojects incorporated
biodiversity conservation activities financed by the GEF. Of that total, 896 subprojects were
                                                 51
funded exclusively by GEF and 627 received a grant/funding from both Bank and GEF (Table
8).

            (*) Around 3% or 159 of all approved subprojects were not executed, primarily due to death of the applicant


3.47 Given that the predominant productive use for natural pastures in Uruguay is livestock
production, the largest contribution (in terms of quantity) of GEF funds was assigned to
integrated management practices in livestock production on natural pastures, promoting native
forage species. The most commonly promoted practices were aimed at the preservation of
valuable native grass species through: (i) adjusted stocking rates and grazing management,
according to resource capacity; (ii) increased paddock divisions/sub-divisions and water
availability to promote rotational grazing; (iii) improved coverage of soil and quality of forage
(legumes); (iv) natural fertilizers (phosphorus); and (v) forest shade/shelter using native species.

3.48 Positive Environmental Impact: PPR had a positive environmental impact on a total of
465,300 hectares of natural pastures through promoting sustainable resource use and encouraging
biodiversity conservation/responsible management. PPR also achieved the installation of forest
shade and shelter using native species in 484 different subprojects.
3.49 Through adjusting stocking rates and including more frequent fallow periods in grazing
management, PPR expects to have contributed to the effective maintenance and encouraging
sustainable growing conditions for natural pastures, as well as maintaining a more stable
ecosystem—and therefore improved the capability for recovering after droughts. PPR also
introduced an increased number of paddocks which encouraged more efficient grazing system
designs and improved re-growth of natural species.

Other important results supported through GEF project funds were the following:

      Recovery of native forest and promotion of alternatives to sustainable uses of native flora
       and fauna
      Establishment of conservation areas on farms to protect particular species or key sites of
       high biodiversity, e.g. conservation measures of wild deer populations, grassland birds,
       feathery palms (Butia capitata), and numerous protected areas for regeneration of
       degraded environments in various parts of the country



                                                               52
       Control of invasive alien flora and fauna species, affecting both biodiversity and
        responsible production. Species identified as particularly threatening were privet,
        gleditsia, gorse and blackberry (flora), and wild boar (fauna), all of which were
        mitigated/controlled on important farm areas
     Protection of “Riparian areas? of high biodiversity that provide various ecosystem
        services such as filtering pollutants, nutrient uptake in plant biomass, as well as habitat
        and food for many animal groups.
3.50 While the Environmental Impact Assessment System for PPR (see Stachetti et al. –
EMBRAPA, 2012) has not yet applied quantitative parameters which could prove favorable
impacts associated with sustainable resources exploitation and natural habitats conservation,
results from others projects indicate the improvements associated with conservation of
biodiversity.

 Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1     During the final months of the Uruguay Integrated Natural Resource and Biodiversity
Management Project (or PPR, as known locally) conducted a survey to measure project
beneficiary satisfaction with various aspects of its implementation and to gauge opinions about
various issues. The survey results are useful for the formulation and development of strategies
designed to integrate NRM and biodiversity conservation in further similar rural development
practice and activities. In line with this development goal, the GOU’s policy is to frequently take
into consideration the opinions and perceptions of project participants to improve the quality of
rural development projects and programs.

5.2     Objectives: The overall objective of this survey was to measure the level of project
beneficiaries’ satisfaction and to suggest recommendations for improvement of specific measures
and policies supporting responsible production in the context of rural development. The specific
objectives were: (i) to evaluate project beneficiaries’ perceptions of project implementation; and
(ii) to characterize the attitudes of producers about the sustainability of natural resource
management and biodiversity conservation practices implemented on their farming operations.

5.3    Methodology: The study used a qualitative descriptive approach to learn from
beneficiaries about their experience with PPR. Two quantitative research techniques were used,
including a survey and interviews. The information was collected from a representative sample
of project beneficiaries by sector of production and location (Department in Uruguay). The
survey research methodology facilitated the objectives to assess satisfaction of beneficiaries with
PPR activities and the sustainability of project objectives. It also compared the general
expectations of beneficiaries and their perceptions regarding the services provided by PPR. In
this way, it was possible to measure, in part, the quality of project services and the gap between
expectations and perceptions as strong indicators for future improvement.

5.4     Regarding beneficiaries’ perceptions, the survey focused on: (i) different aspects of
project implementation (financial, technical advice, training, management); and (ii) key themes
addressed by PPR such as integrated NRM and biodiversity conservation in agriculture. The
"attitudinal survey" analyzed beneficiaries’ conduct in relation to continued sustainable practices
of NRM and biodiversity conservation on-farm.

5.5     PPR’s technical unit led the formulation of the questionnaire for the survey, and data
collection work was carried out by a contracted consulting firm.

5.6      Study population: The study population comprised 3,357 subprojects covering various
types of production systems, approved within the first two calls for proposals in the years 2007
and 2008 15 and implemented nationwide. A representative sample was designed through a
stratified random sampling technique in order for the information collected to be generalized to
the entire universe of 3,357 total subprojects.



15
     This does not include the subprojects of the last call for proposals "Water for Livestock Production.?

                                                                          55
5.7    Main survey specifications: The sample was stratified in two-stages according to
geographical location (Department) - the primary unit of selection - and the main source of
funding (World Bank or GEF):
 Selection of the departments Canelones, Salto, San Jose, Rivera, Peach and Lavalleja was
    based on expert knowledge, concentration of subprojects, and variety of types of production
 The unit of observation in the sample was “producer?
 154 producers were interviewed between 24 July to 5 August 2012
 The questionnaire comprised 58 questions and the interview lasted approximately 20 minutes
 The respondents were the decision-makers on the farm, or their substitute

Main Findings:

A. Overall assessment of PPR

   In general, beneficiaries express high satisfaction with the overall project. Figure 1 shows
   that over 99 percent of the beneficiaries when asked to assess their participation in PPR
   expressed satisfactory (55 percent) and very satisfactory (44 percent) opinions, implying
   strong support for the process of project implementation.

Turning to the identification of what was the main goal in doing a subproject, 71 percent of
the beneficiaries believed their subproject solved a problem on their farming operation, 58
percent reported that they incorporated a new technological practice, and 33 percent stated
that the main goal was to attract a grant. With regards to the implementation of the subproject
activities, the majority of respondents noted an improvement in their level of production and
their quality of life (Fig 3).

With regards to the main contributions of PPR, the respondents noted that the project meant a
significant financial support on-farm in terms of farming and water improvements,
production techniques, and TA.
Regarding the improvements and changes introduced on-farm by the subprojects, 66 percent
of beneficiaries made changes in terms of water management and 41 percent introduced
pasture management practices. Activities such as chemical container management and
linkages with local institutions received fewer mentions (Figure 4).

One of the key objectives of MGAP has been to strengthen support to “family farming?
operations, as well as enabling and encouraging public and private partnerships. With this
intention, PPR facilitated local meeting points for information sharing, measures to reduce
“rural isolation? and to enhance horizontal and vertical cooperation. As shown below, 61
percent of respondents perceived the relationship with the project as “good? and 34 percent
as “very good.? Only 4 percent perceived this relationship as “regular? (Figure 5).

   In addition to the positive relationship between PPR and beneficiaries, over 70 percent
   expressed an improved opinion of MGAP as a result of the project (Figure 6). PPR proved to
   be a good mechanism for linking household production and MGAP, and when beneficiaries
   were surveyed about their previous involvement with MGAP programs, over half indicated
   that they had no prior involvement with the Ministry (Figure 7).

B. Initial knowledge of PPR

   32 percent of the respondents were aware of the existence of PPR through producer
   organizations in their areas (Figure 8). This reaffirms the importance of social organizations
   and their crucial role in articulating the initiatives promoted by the GOU.

The main reasons given by producers for their participation in PPR were to (i) improve the
natural resources of their farms, (ii) raise funds, and (iii) obtain TA (Figure 9).

Once potential beneficiaries learned about PPR and expressed a desire to prepare a proposal
for submission, producers first contact with PPR were with field technicians, mainly
agronomists. This reinforced the importance of field technicians working on behalf of
PPR/MGAP locally and also consolidated the working relationship between the producer and
the technician for tailored results to meet beneficiaries’ needs.

C. Integration in producer groups

   Producers believed that the strategy of PPR/MGAP to promote the consolidation of
   producers’ groups was successful. The calls for proposals launched by PPR also encouraged
   group/cooperative-led subprojects: 64 percent of the beneficiaries interviewed submitted
   their subprojects within a group framework (See Figure 10). Some 56 percent of these groups
   were newly established and 42 percent of them already existed. PPR was a plausible
   instrument for strengthening producer networks. The graph on the left-hand side of Figure 10
   shows that most of the producers (94 percent) were satisfied with the work of their group
   after subproject completion, and 50 percent of them were still conducting joint activities.
   This represented an improvement on previous projects, where groups mostly disintegrated
   after completing the execution of project activities.

                                                                 64%



68 percent of the producers considered integration in a producer group as “very useful? and 68
percent believe that the functioning of the group was “good,? as shown in Figure 11.

D. Satisfaction with project procedures and presentation of subprojects

   Beneficiaries were satisfied with different aspects of project implementation, with the highest
   ratings for clarity in explaining conditions for accessing grant funding – in other words, PPR
   successfully communicated objectives and eligibility criteria well, as well as the usefulness
   of receiving payment in advance at the beginning of the subproject.

E. Satisfaction with field technical assistance

   Some 86 percent of the interviewed beneficiaries stated that their subproject proposal was
   developed jointly with the field technician, while only 69 percent established subproject
   goals and targets jointly with the field technician. However, 20 percent of the interviewed
   beneficiaries stated that their subproject proposal was developed solely by the technician.

   Some 70 percent of producers presented their proposals to PPR through: (i) technicians from
   their own producer associations, (ii) technicians introduced by another producer, or (iii) other
   ways. This might indicate the establishment of new technical ties or a new working
   relationship between the technician and the producer after PPR.

   About 15 percent of interviewed beneficiaries acknowledged difficulties in accessing to a
   private field technician following project support, mainly due to inability to afford such
   services.

                          Figure 12: Satisfaction with field technicians

F. Satisfaction with technical assistance from project regional technicians

   The regional technician played a key role during the project. He/she was the MGAP
   reference locally and an indispensable interlocutor for PPR. The interviewed beneficiaries
   were consulted on the field visits conducted by the regional technician. 85 percent of the
   respondents said that the regional technician visited the farm regularly. But often these field
   visits were either to perform audits (34 percent) or to end-monitor (9 percent). Some 58
   percent and 38 percent of the interviewed producers felt “very satisfied? and “satisfied,?
   respectively, with the work completed by the regional technician.

G. Training activities, capacity development and knowledge transfer

   Since inception, PPR promoted capacity-building activities aimed at training producers,
   technicians, and rural communities. These activities had a strong impact on local areas and
   provided a mechanism to strengthen productive activity and quality of life for rural families.
   Through PPR, meeting points were established for the purposes of information sharing and
   knowledge transfer.

   Some 54 percent of the respondents participated in some form of training activity (Figure
   15). Of these, 95 percent evaluated these activities as “very useful? (64 percent) and
   “helpful? (31 percent).

    More than half of the producers interviewed had access to project technical manuals,
    brochures, and/or videos (54 percent). Those who were able to access communication
    materials evaluated them as “very useful? (59 percent) or “useful? (35 percent).

Conclusions

   Beneficiaries assessed the overall project “very positively? and most of them agreed that PPR
    contributed to the improvement of both income and quality of life
   Beneficiaries implementing “integrated subprojects? expressed the highest satisfaction levels
   Water management and pasture management were perceived as the most demanded
    interventions
   Beneficiaries described their relationship with PPR as “good,? and 70 percent of them had an
    improved opinion about MGAP
   Although most of the respondents perceived changes in their relationships with other farmers
    and producer organizations due to PPR, only a few of them highlighted these as the most
    relevant or the most important project achievement. Half of the producers who submitted
    their subproject as part of a group still maintained joint activities with their group
   Most beneficiaries were “very satisfied? with the support provided by project TA
    Beneficiaries rated training, information sharing, and knowledge-transfer activities as very
    useful and helpful

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

No official Stakeholder Workshop was held at project closing. However, a formal project closing
meeting was held September 17-18, 2012 in Piriápolis, Uruguay, in which many stakeholders
attended and participated in a presentation discussing findings from the Borrower Completion
Report (see Annex 7 for Executive Summary) and overall project achievements. No formal
written outputs/minutes were generated from this meeting.

      URUGUAY INTEGRATED NATURAL RESOURCES AND BIODIVERSITY
                    MANAGEMENT PROJECT (PPR)

            BORROWER COMPLETION REPORT EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                           (TRANSLATED)


Uruguay is essentially an agricultural country and is very well endowed with natural resources
for production in this sector. The agriculture and agro-industry sectors combined account for
over 25 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP). The output of these sectors is
exported and in the early 2000s accounted for 70 percent of Uruguay’s total export earnings.

Any increase in agricultural production must come from an increase in productivity, because
there is limited scope for additional land conversion and, in order to achieve long-term
sustainability, it is vital that intensification should not undermine the supporting natural resource
base.

In a general context of lower production, agreement was reached in 1994 on the first World
Bank-supported project designed to improve the management of natural resources in the
agricultural sector and to promote irrigation development: the Natural Resources Management
and Irrigation Development Project (PRENADER). The duration of the project was over seven
years and it helped to disseminate techniques of sustainable NRM, particularly through the pilot
micro-watershed project.

Despite the progress made by PRENADER, however, at the beginning of the twenty-first
century, before the new Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP)/World Bank
project was launched, there were still some problems of NRM. These mainly concerned soil
degradation, natural pasture degradation, excessive use and poor handling of insecticides in
agricultural, horticultural and fruit production systems, lack of rational management of expired
containers and insecticides, water and groundwater contamination, quantitative and qualitative
problems with water supply systems for livestock production, lack of shade for livestock,
inefficient use of irrigation, degradation of native forests, planting of alien species in soils
suitable for agriculture, and proliferation of invasive alien flora and fauna species. In addition,
there was no national eco-regional biological vision and nothing was being done to promote and
enhance native biological diversity and allow its rational use. Artisanal fishing in inland waters
was not managed rationally.

MGAP decided to tackle these problems, selecting a project focused on improving NRM and
mainstreaming biodiversity by supporting plans for integrated management of natural resources
in agricultural establishments.

In May 2005, the World Bank conducted an appraisal of the proposed project and prepared the
relevant Project Appraisal Document (PAD), summarizing the agreements reached with the
GOU on the project proposal. These agreements establish, inter alia, that the project would

                                                 66
receive technical and financial support from the World Bank, under the Loan Agreement for an
amount of US$30 million, and financial resources consisting of a grant from the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) in the amount of US$7 million, MGAP matching funding (US$3
million) and a significant contribution from the project beneficiaries.

The date of effectiveness of the project (arrival of the first funds) was November 2005.

The project was extremely successful and in 2011, by agreement between MGAP and the World
Bank, it was extended for one year with a final completion date of August 31, 2012.

One of the project’s most striking features was that it succeeded in mainstreaming the
biodiversity component, not only at the production/farm level but also by including the topic in
the country’s agricultural institutional arrangements and generating support for the identification
and adoption of production-compatible conservation practices.

The overall project objective was to promote the adoption of economically and environmentally
viable systems of integrated and efficient management of natural resources for agricultural use,
including biological diversity.

In order to do this, specific goals were set to resolve the issues described and an implementation
strategy was designed focusing on:

      A financial incentive scheme for producers to encourage sustainable management of
       natural resources;
      Use of all public and private institutions already existing in Uruguay, with particular
       emphasis on trade unions and producer organizations, cooperatives and rural
       development associations;
      Strong emphasis on communication at various levels of society in order to publicize the
       goals, activities and benefits of involvement in the project;
      Private TA. The project funded local in-field technicians to design, formulate and
       supervise the execution and correct completion of subprojects. The TA funding was
       additional to the grant and project support therefore consisted of TA and direct
       disbursement;
      Encouraging producer groups to put forward technical proposals for project funding.
       Group work fosters interaction between neighboring producers for the design and
       execution of subprojects, as well as for more productive organization of training and
       participatory outreach events;
      Working agreements concluded with producer organizations and other agricultural
       institutions. Under these agreements, the project funded a part and the institution made a
       matching contribution;
      Special attention to training, both of technicians and of producers, participatory outreach
       and communication, using various media and instruments.

PPR initially came under the authority of the General Directorate for Renewable Natural
Resources (RENARE). Subsequently, following the creation in 2008 of the General Directorate
for Rural Development (DGDR), it was transferred to that new Directorate, together with the

                                                67
other externally-financed MGAP projects. However, there continued to be close contact and
coordination with RENARE and other MGAP General Directorates: the General Directorate for
Forestry (DGF), the General Directorate for Agricultural Services (DGSA), the General
Directorate for Farms (DIGEGRA), the Department Directors and the Decentralization Unit
(created in 2007).

Apart from MGAP, the project coordinated and interacted with directorates in other ministries as
well as public and private institutions connected with the agricultural sector. These public
institutions included the National Directorate for the Environment (DINAMA), the National
Directorate for Land Use (DINOT) and the newly created National Directorate for Water
(DINAGUA), which are all part of the Ministry of Housing, Land Use and Environment. The
private institutions included the National Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA), the
Agricultural Planning Institute (IPA), the Land Settlement Institute (INC) and the Directorate for
Development Projects (DIPRODE) of the Office of Planning and Budget (OPP).

There was also extensive technical coordination with the University of the Republic (UdeLaR)
and in particular with the Faculty of Agronomy, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, the Faculty
of Science and the Faculty of Engineering.

Lastly, mention should be made of the interaction with producer organizations and particularly
with two cooperative trade unions (the National Rural Development Commission (CNFR) and
Federated Agrarian Cooperatives (CAF)) and a number of cooperatives and rural development
associations throughout Uruguay affiliated with the above-mentioned trade unions.

In March 2005, discussions began between the team designing the new project, the new
administration and the World Bank mission. Agreements were concluded and progress was
made in drafting the basic documents. Shortly afterwards, the document entitled “Integrated
Natural Resources and Biodiversity Management? (“Responsible Production?) was approved.

After two months of joint work and on the basis of the discussions and consensus achieved, the
initial agreements were signed at the World Bank office in Buenos Aires. Later, in June 2005,
the loan agreement and GEF grant were signed at the recently inaugurated World Bank office in
Montevideo. The signatories were: for the World Bank, Ms. Pamela Cox, Vice-President; for the
GOU, the Minister for Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr. José Mujica, and the Minister
for Economy and Finance, Mr. Danilo Astori. They are currently President and Vice-President
of the Republic, respectively.

Throughout its execution, PPR received important technical and supervisory support from the
World Bank through various channels. There were 20 supervisory missions, ten portfolio
reviews and a number of fiduciary review missions. A mid-term review was also conducted by
an independent consultant.

The project was organized by a Project Executing Unit, which was given the necessary technical
and administrative staff and the teams needed for its normal operation. Shortly after the start of
activities, 16 regional technicians were hired. They were the executive arm of the project
throughout the country.

                                               68
TA for the subprojects was entrusted to a technician selected by the producer and his group.
Thus a large number of technicians trained in agrarian science (agronomists, veterinarians,
agricultural technicians) and in other specific disciplines needed for projects of a particular kind
(geologists, biologists, etc.) worked throughout Uruguay.

In order for goals to be met and for the strategy to be implemented, the project was divided into
four components. A detailed description is given below of the components, the activities for
each of them and the results achieved.

Component 1: Natural resources and biodiversity management

This project channeled financial resources directly to individual producers or groups of
producers interested in implementing farming projects (subprojects) for integrated natural
resources and biodiversity management.

The project provided financial resources and TA to promote conservation practices and
management of natural resources and biodiversity in livestock, dairy and intensive crop
production systems.

On a smaller scale, work was done on farming systems and artisanal fishing in inland waters.

Analysis of a sample consisting of 75 percent of the subproject completion reports shows that, in
general, implementation of the various activities far exceeded what had originally been proposed.

An analysis of what was actually done compared with what was proposed in the subproject
shows that the practices included in the systematization item (leveling, systematization of
planting, road lowering, contouring and terracing) had high rate of implementation (86.4 percent
in the sample analyzed). The implementation rate was also high for activities involving
management of soil, natural pasture and water for livestock, because climate events during the
project lifetime (droughts) encouraged producers to engage in such activities in order to have
water of sufficient quantity and quality as well as forage for animal feeding.

One of the project’s main goals was to integrate all the supported subprojects, including
biodiversity of production systems, and to integrate the two main sources of funding (World
Bank and GEF) for supported subprojects.

While it was difficult to reconcile biodiversity with the national production system, the co-
financing of subprojects with loans and grants did much to overcome these difficulties, providing
excellent additionality.

Of the 5,300 subprojects funded under PPR, 1,523 specifically incorporated the biodiversity
component by emphasizing conservation and/or sustainable use, funded by the GEF. Of this
total, 896 subprojects were funded exclusively by the GEF and 627 had combined GEF/World
Bank funding. As regards the size of the farms where the GEF funds were used, there were
1,220 small-scale producers, 248 medium-scale producers and 50 large-scale producers (MGAP
definitions).

                                                69
Upon conclusion of the project, there were 1,732 proposals for improving natural pasture
management, most of which have some GEF funding. In addition, a total of 465,300 hectares of
natural pasture are affected, with promotion of sustainable use of the resource and of
biodiversity. There are 484 activities for shade and shelter creation using native species,
combined with integrated management of natural pasture.

In pursuit of the biodiversity goals, the project encouraged registration of native forests of
beneficiary producers, subsidizing the costs under farming subprojects. It also promoted various
alternative sustainable uses of native flora and fauna.

The creation of conservation areas on productive farms has been encouraged, in order to protect
particular species or key sites of high biodiversity. Examples are conservation of wild deer,
grassland birds, feathery palms and numerous protected areas for regeneration of degraded
environments in various parts of the country.

Worked was also done on control of invasive alien flora and fauna species affecting both
biodiversity and, to a great extent, agricultural production.

With regard to biodiversity, mention should be made of the coordination with the DINAMA,
through ongoing participation of the project in the Expanded Project Executing Agency of the
Directorate’s National System of Protected Areas, as well as with various non-governmental
organizations.

Following the severe drought which affected the north of the country at the end of 2005 and in
2006, MGAP asked the project management and the World Bank whether funds from PPR could
be used to finance a special program to supply water for livestock. The World Bank issued the
necessary “no objection? and the Fund for Prevention of the Effects of Drought was designed. It
became operational in late 2006 to deal with the effects of the drought. The new program helped
small-scale and medium-scale “family farmers? in the departments of Tacuarembó, Paysandú,
Salto, Rivera and Artigas.

The subprojects of this component consisted of specific financial support in the form of co-
financing of construction of wells, embankments and water management and distribution
systems for livestock farmers. Both small-scale and medium-scale “family farmers? received 80
percent of the total cost of the project and provided 20 percent as a matching contribution.

Modeled on the Fund for Prevention of the Effects of Drought and its impact, and following
another drought which affected the east central part of the country, the Quality Water Project was
launched in 2009. This was an initiative of the intendencias of Durazno, Flores, Maldonado,
Rocha and Treinta y Tres.

Lastly, another drought affected a large part of the country in 2010. This was the reason for the
“Water for Livestock Production? (or APA, per its Spanish acronym) initiative, designed to find
ways of supplying water on farms of small-scale and medium-scale livestock and dairy
producers throughout the country, in a context of climate change.



                                               70
Following a unanimous decision by MGAP authorities, the DGDR and PPR, funding for these
subprojects is shared between this Project and the new MGAP/World Bank project
“Development and Adaptation to Climate Change?, which is already operational.

This arrangement whereby execution is shared between two projects (one ending and the other
beginning) is viewed as promoting a smooth transition between the two and gives the new
project a platform of subprojects enabling it to be launched without any pressure to generate
demand for the activities offered to the beneficiary population.

Component 2: Priority Biodiversity Areas

The plan was to organize demonstration projects in ten priority areas selected during the project
preparation phase.

Execution of this component proved problematic. It was finally possible to cover all the priority
areas through farming subprojects, although consultations for demonstration projects were held
in only three cases: Arerunguá, Laureles and Lake Castillos.

Component 3: Support Services

An important element of this component was the creation of the Institutional Liaison Unit. This
Unit worked to promote participation at the local level and provided training, in close
coordination with the Communication and Dissemination Unit.

The project intervention model using farming subprojects which stimulate group formation and
have institutional backing was crucial. Among other functions, the groups served as forums for
producer-to-producer learning, in the same way as institutional backing was a means of
publicizing the project and of recognizing the role of organizations in the territory.

The system of working agreements was helpful in publicizing project proposals and was a good
strategy of institutional coordination to ensure that the issue remained on the institutional and
social agenda.

Although there were various types of agreement, they all concerned integrated natural resources
and biodiversity management, awareness-raising and training in these issues and infrastructure
support needed for an integrated approach.

The training made it possible to identify and acknowledge future needs, as well as technical
resources required, and to develop human resources for the actual project.

Within this sub-component, the Institutional Liaison Unit promoted activities such as:

(a) Specialized training for the professionals providing TA to producers for the design and
execution of subprojects.




                                               71
(b) Training of producers in innovative ways of using and conserving natural resources and
biodiversity.

Mention should be made of the Participatory Outreach Workshops which, in addition to being a
working tool, were also a reaffirmation of the project approach and modus operandi. The
Workshops started in 2008, on producers’ farms and with the participation and involvement of
various stakeholders. They began by identifying problems and needs of “family farmers? at the
local level. Producers in the area and in other areas with similar production systems were thus
able to participate actively and enthusiastically in each Workshop. The relevant technicians,
producer organizations and local authorities also participated.

The methodology used in the Participatory Outreach Workshops consisted of stakeholder
participation, a combination of practical, empirical and scientific knowledge geared to problem
solving and specific needs, and an efficient multi-media approach incorporating various
strategies and communication technologies for knowledge sharing.

The project also funded studies and applied research designed to improve the framework of
policies for natural resource management and to develop new techniques in areas posing special
difficulties, with a clear environmental benefit. Thus special emphasis was placed on prevention
of soil erosion and on the use and responsible management of insecticides.

Component 4: Project Administration

The project’s M&E Unit provided ongoing follow-up of the variables involved in the subprojects
being implemented and in the project as a whole using the indicators specified and agreed in the
Logical Framework for PPR.

It was also responsible for the design and application of specific systems for measuring
environmental impacts resulting from implementation of subprojects. Use was made of tools
generated by the project, such as the Assessment of Environmental Impact of Rural Activities
and the sustainability indicators for family dairy farming. Both provided objective findings
regarding the impacts of subprojects on producers’ farms, permitting subsequent analysis and
interpretation of the environmental impact of PPR during its execution.

Also for the purpose of assessing the impact of PPR, a Survey on Adoption and Sustainability of
Management Practices was conducted. The complete results of this survey will be published
separately from this report.

For the study, a methodology based on “continuity of measures? and “perception of impact of
measures? indices was used. The management measures with a clearly positive impact were:
subdivisions, embankments, irrigation equipment, fertilization and refertilization of natural
pasture, adjustment of livestock load per hectare, “green manure?, storage tanks, semi-artesian
wells; and direct seeding or minimum tillage.

Seeding coverage with legumes, overhaul of water sources, monitoring of fallow periods and
occupation of natural pastures; drinking stations, effluent management, other organic

                                              72
amendments, crop rotation, mitigation of gullies and improved fertilization schemes had a
positive impact, with scope for improvement in some aspects.

The measures with insufficient impact were: planting of shade and shelter woodlands, creation
of pastures, systematization of land plots, control of erosion, improvement of infrastructure and
working conditions, rotary hoeing and water quality analysis.

The team of consultants found that the water collection and distribution installations are in good
shape and doing their job, providing an acceptable supply. They deliver good quality water and
the parts are working well. This is one of the measures with the greatest impact at the level of
the farming system and with the highest level of acceptance among producers.

However, there are a few cases in which some of the technical criteria promoted by the project
are not fully met.

With the exception of special circumstances due to disbursement delays (to be improved in
future activities) or to increased costs over the period, the measures planned were implemented.

Producers find that the measures adopted are appropriate for production and conservation of
natural resources and that the differences in results or continuity concern specific aspects which
have been addressed in this study.

It is considered essential for the field technician to monitor implementation of actions that
integrate production with conservation. This is true of the various phases: for identification of
problems and possible solutions, as a way of revitalizing an area, for technical adjustment of
measures, etc.

In conjunction with the Adoption and Sustainability Assessment, a Beneficiary Satisfaction
Survey was conducted. Its sample size and methodology were different: the goal was to measure
the level of satisfaction of beneficiary producers and to ascertain their attitude towards
conservation practices.

Generally speaking, beneficiaries were found to be extremely satisfied with the project in
general. When the degree of general satisfaction was analyzed by type of project and item of
production, it was found that producers with “integrated? financing had a generally more positive
view of the project (54 percent were very positive).

Similarly, a more detailed analysis showed that those with the most positive view of the project
are producers engaged in dairy farming (49 percent were very positive).

When asked to identify the main reason for implementing a project, producers generally replied
that it was to solve a problem on their farm. They said that implementing the project usually
brought about an improvement in their production and quality of life; on the other hand, it most
infrequently meant access to services and inputs, reflecting producers’ interests and the fact that
the country’s agriculture is well organized. When asked how they viewed the contribution of the



                                                73
project, producers replied that it provided considerable financial assistance for farming,
obtaining water, improving production and technical aspects.

Producers considered their relationship with PPR to be good (61 percent) or very good (34
percent). Only 4 percent viewed the relationship as average.

A corollary of this positive relationship is the change in producers’ image of MGAP as a
government institution brought about by implementation of PPR. Over 70 percent of producers
said that the Ministry’s image had been enhanced by their participation in the project.

PPR created a good link between family farming and MGAP. When asked about their previous
contacts with the Ministry, over half of the beneficiary producers said that they had none until
they participated in the project with that Ministry.

As regards producers’ degree of satisfaction with various aspects of the project execution,
considerable satisfaction was expressed with all aspects (over 75 percent). Producers
particularly appreciated the clear explanation of conditions for obtaining project funding,
demonstrating the excellent ability of the project to communicate its goals and criteria, and the
fact that they were able to obtain an advance of funds to commence the farming project.

With regard to training and workshops with producers, 56 percent of beneficiary producers
participated in a training activity. Of that 56 percent, 95 percent found these activities very
useful or useful (64 and 31 percent respectively).

The study concluded that beneficiaries generally had a very positive view of the project. In
addition a large majority of beneficiaries agreed that PPR had improved their production, their
income and their quality of life.

The Communication and Dissemination Unit was requested to implement the Communication
and Dissemination Plan and it started work by drafting the Plan for the entire project period.

The approach adopted was to publicize the existence and the features of the project and to keep
up a permanent flow of information on the progress of activities and the results obtained, as well
as the concepts involved in the final goal of the project: to solve the problems identified with the
existing state of national resources and to reverse the process of deterioration which they have
suffered, by creating a general awareness and adopting the recommended management practices.

In order to attain the goals of the project, it was necessary to reach different audiences,
depending on the topic covered. For topics relating to the operation of the project, the target
audience was groups of producers, local governments and the technicians directly involved in the
farming or group projects being funded. In the case of natural resources and biodiversity
management, it was a broader audience encompassing the entire rural family in addition to
producers and technicians.

The target audience for promotion and dissemination activities was the rural dweller, his family
and his groups, together with the agriculture technicians. Various strategies, instruments and

                                                74
activities, which are described in the body of this report, were used to implement the
Communication and Dissemination Plan. It is worth mentioning the number of promotion and
dissemination workshops: 230 workshops attended by 5,450 participants.

The Participatory Outreach Workshops were an important method of communication, outreach
and training.

The technical visits to farms were also crucial and a key role was played by the technicians from
the Natural Resources Unit and the regional technicians, at field workshops, following up on
Component 1 subprojects in various parts of the country.

Lastly, one-day training workshops were held for various audiences on specific topics. There
were workshops for producers, on topics such as management of agrochemicals and triple
washing of containers, biodigestors, gorse control, treatment of effluents etc.

The topics covered for technicians included construction and maintenance of boreholes,
construction of embankments, renewable energies, etc.

In the education sector, which will be dealt with in a separate chapter of this report, training
workshops were organized for rural teachers, for geography teachers and for students at urban
and rural schools.

In addition, at project start-up, intensive training was provided to 90 mass media specialists
throughout the country on sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity and on
how responsible production works.

Audiovisual materials were used extensively in project communication activities, because of
their strong impact and lasting effect. In this context, promotional materials were prepared for
the media, as well as testimonial videos in which producers themselves recount their
experiences, and thematic videos designed to remain relevant after the completion of PPR. In
all, over 150 complete sets of material were prepared.

Similarly, the technical and communication aspects of PPR were reflected in printed matter of
various kinds and with different objectives, including books (manuals). Particular emphasis was
placed on work with the education sector, in the belief that it is essential to introduce the topic of
the environment to the very young. Rural schools are an excellent way of reaching rural
families, because they are the most widespread institutions in Uruguay. Rural teachers are
models for their community and therefore influence their environment.

Before starting to plan the materials, training sessions were held with 360 rural teachers and
workshops at which the teachers proposed methods and types of material best suited for the
classroom. This method, in which teachers were consulted beforehand, was very much
appreciated and ushered in a new type of relationship between the Ministry and the teaching
profession.




                                                 75
The Administration and Finance Unit was in charge of project administration, financial
management and accounting. It was also responsible for hiring, financial transfers, procurement,
consultancies, financial evaluation of subprojects and everything needed for the project to
function.

Its main task was to keep an accounting record of financial transactions in order to provide
financial information to the project management, the World Bank, the GOU and third parties in
order to facilitate decision-making, project implementation monitoring and participation in
operational planning. It was responsible for management of the procurement needed for project
implementation and for administration of the human and material resources of the Project
Executing Unit.

All project operations involving movements of funds were processed and monitored by the
Administration and Finance Unit. It was responsible for the coordination of mechanisms and
operations with the Court of Accounts of the Republic, the Auditor’s Office of the Nation, the
General Treasury of the Nation and the Auditor’s Office of MGAP.

The Administration and Finance Unit coordinated all monitoring by government agencies, the
Court of Accounts of the Republic and the Internal Auditor’s Office, processing and providing
information to the auditors and arranging for implementation of the recommendations made by
those agencies.

It performed the same duties with regard to World Bank supervision missions, portfolio reviews,
financial reviews and procurement.

The Administration and Finance Unit was also responsible for the general administration,
logistics and secretariat of the project. This task required considerable effort and commitment
and, as noted below, should have been entrusted to a specialized unit.

Details of the statements of accounts and financial management are given in the body of the
document, although it should be noted that the financial performance data are not final and that
the accounts have not yet been closed.

Overall Conclusions

After seven and a half years, the following conclusions can be drawn about PPR:

   The project succeeded in putting responsible production on the agenda of the various
    institutional stakeholders in the agricultural sector.
   By offering financial incentives to producers, the GOU is promoting the adoption of new
    practices and activities which benefit the producers and society as a whole and motivate them
    to invest in their own establishments.
   The support of all the public and private institutions already existing in Uruguay, and
    particularly of trade unions and producer organizations, cooperatives and rural development
    associations, made it possible to reach a larger number of beneficiaries more rapidly.


                                               76
   The permanent presence of regional technicians throughout the country ensured follow-up of
    subproject execution and completion of the multiple field tasks related to the project. The
    regional technicians interact on a regional basis with the direct beneficiaries, their technicians
    and public and private local institutions.
   The methodology for evaluation of the subprojects was found to be very good. The regional
    technicians performed the field validation jointly with private technicians and producers. In
    addition, the Central Evaluation Commission, an internal interdisciplinary body, acted
    independently and complied strictly with criteria for technical, environmental and financial
    viability.
   The outreach, training and dissemination programs made it possible to keep a large number
    of technicians, producers, rural schoolchildren, high school students and rural inhabitants in
    general informed about the premises and concepts of NRM and environmental conservation.
   It was a good idea to become involved in the education of children and young people in order
    to create and sustain interest in environmental conservation, sustainability of natural
    resources and biodiversity at an early age. It is assumed that a child or a young person who
    has received an environmental education will pass on these concepts to his or her family and
    milieu.
   In addition, this creates a very important logistical base: every Uruguayan schoolchild has a
    computer and computers are also being provided to secondary school students. Information
    technology is extremely important for dissemination of the concepts of environmental
    conservation and NRM.
   The use of technology to interact and share experience, methods and techniques for
    sustainability of natural resources and biodiversity at the various levels of the target audience
    (producers, technicians, managers, general public) is extremely important for the
    understanding and acceptance of the technical and methodological messages conveyed.
   The TA given to all beneficiary producers provided ongoing technical guidance concerning
    new practices and activities and fostered a good relationship between technicians and
    producers. This is acknowledged even by producers who had never received TA on their
    farms.
   Also in the case of farming projects, PPR operated through groups of producers. Some
    groups already existed and others were formed on the basis of MGAP projects. Producers
    and their trade unions realized the need for technical and methodological support for the
    formation of groups to ensure that they were harmonious.
   Special attention was paid to training for technicians and producers, to participatory outreach
    and to communication using various media and instruments. From the outset, the emphasis
    was on production of technical materials, publications, audiovisual material and anything that
    could help to disseminate the premises of conservation and sustainable use of natural
    resources and biodiversity.
   Interaction with the various technicians, farm advisers, regional technicians and producer
    groups revealed the need for ongoing training either to provide updates on the various issues
    or to cover topics on which people had not had an opportunity to be trained as part of their
    professional development.
   PPR leaves operating capacity (infrastructure, practices, instruments) with the potential to
    improve NRM and to ensure appropriate treatment of biodiversity. Thus the project is
    leaving the country a great deal of infrastructure for better development and use of natural


                                                 77
    resources, especially in the case of “family farmers? for whom the GOU subsidies are
    justified.
   A team specializing in integrated natural resources and biodiversity management will build
    the institutional capacity of MGAP to work on this issue.
   At the right time (and to a certain extent ahead of time), PPR promoted the adoption of
    practices and strategies with the potential for policy formulation.
   When the project was launched, the central team thought that it would be difficult to sell the
    topic of NRM to producers, who were more concerned with productivity and profitability.
    Today producers recognize that many good water and soil management practices result in
    almost immediate increases in productivity.
   Unfortunately, this linkage between conservation and productivity was not perceived to the
    same extent in the case of the biodiversity resource. PPR succeeded in promoting recognition
    of the advantages of biodiversity in its various aspects, including natural pastures.
   The idea of environmental impact assessment at the level of agricultural production was
    introduced through the Assessment of Rural Environmental Impact. This assessment has
    considerable potential, although it could be used to only a limited extent in PPR.
   PPR had a high execution rate, with more projects, direct and indirect beneficiaries and
    impacted areas than had been initially envisaged.
   Support was received from a large number and great variety of institutions and in particular
    from producer organizations, which helped to disseminate the objectives and methodology,
    approved and supervised field projects and acted as catalysts in the training, outreach,
    communication and dissemination processes.
   During the period in question, major organizational changes in MGAP and important
    climatic phenomena occurred. Fortunately the project design made it easily adaptable and
    able to accommodate these new institutional and climatic situations.
   MGAP has acquired extensive experience in integrated natural resources and biodiversity
    management connected with agricultural production, which must continue and be encouraged
    when PPR comes to an end.
