3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The project objective was to increase system responsiveness to changing labor market demands and
management efficiency of the participating institutions, including setting up mechanisms to use labor
market signals to run and fine-tune training programs, strengthening links with industry, increasing
nongovernment sources for education and training and devolving responsibility to schools under clearly
defined terms of accountability. Specifically, the project would: (a) improve and increase the supply of
skilled labor to meet labor market demands; (b) raise the quality and efficiency of the vocational education
and training system; and (c) build up capacity for monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of pilot
experiences and replication.     To achieve these objectives, a two-prong approach was taken: (i) the
development of 80 (reduced from the original 82) key secondary vocational and technical schools as models
for upgrading the quality and efficiency of vocational education; and (ii) improving the planning and
management of vocational education.

The objectives were consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China, which was
to assist the Government in developing the institutions and mechanisms necessary to sustain rapid growth
and broad-based development, for which a modern labor market and market-oriented vocational and
technical skills would be crucial.        The project would take two strategic steps in developing
vocational-technical skills and a labor market. The first would be the pilot-testing of crucial improvements
in the market-responsiveness and quality of China's vocational and technical schools and their capacity to
provide well-trained workers in the skills sought by the market. The second would be to enhance the
capacity of schools to extend their in-service training and other types of adult education to workers. The
project complemented other investment and technical assistance operations outlined in the CAS for
economic law reform, industrial restructuring, and vocational training, all of which facilitate the
development of a comprehensive framework for the basic policy and investment provisions necessary to
promote market reform.

Project Design. Two aspects were critical to a good project outcome. The first was the upfront emphasis
on project outcomes and impact by clearly stating the key performance indicators (KPIs) and linking them
to the main project objectives. This provided a firm framework for the project institutions and the
provincial and central implementation agencies to focus on the project's basic intent. Fourteen KPIs were
agreed between the Bank and MOE-FILO before credit effectiveness. (See Annex 1) The second aspect
was the detailed preparation of technical assistance (SAR Report No. 15473-CHA, dated May 16, 1996,
Annex 9), which was crucial to the project's reform thrust, particularly the criteria for the selection of
international consultants that included the capability to operate training programs and follow-up seminars
in China.

A bottom-up approach taken in project preparation ensured full participation of the candidate schools, local
government and provincial stakeholders, with MOE-FILO holding overall responsibility. The original
participating provinces were Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong and Tianjin Municipality. They
were selected on the basis of their rapid industrialization, employment-driven demand, and commitment to
planning and managing vocational education reform.        However, in 1998, Tianjin Municipality withdrew
from the project and was replaced by Beijing Municipality.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Objectives not revised.

3.3 Original Components:
The project design was simple and clear-cut, with three components:

a: Development of Key Institutions for Vocational Education ($56.8 million);



                                                     - 2 -

b: Improving Management and Planning of Vocational Education ($1.0 million); and
c: Supporting Project Management ($0.4 million)

The original participating provinces and their respective project schools (number in parenthesis) were as
follows: Guangdong (14), Shandong (17), Jiangsu (23), Liaoning (15), and Tianjin Municipality (13),
covering 82 schools altogether. The withdrawal of Tianjin Municipality and replacement by Beijing
Municipality (with 11 schools) brought the final total number of project schools to 80.

3.4 Revised Components:
Although it was not strictly a component revision, the replacement of Tianjin Municipality in 1998 by
Beijing Municipality was due to the failure to reach agreement on Bank credit/loan funds on-lending
procedures between the Ministry of Finance and Tianjin Municipality, notwithstanding the fact that the
latter had invested funds in project activities. Following an amendment to the Development Credit
Agreement and the Loan Agreement Beijing Municipality joined the project in 1998. Although Beijing
Municipality joined the project mid-way, it did not materially affect the project as a whole, as Beijing
Municipality was able to catch up in all essential aspects (civil works construction, equipment
procurement, and overseas and domestic staff training).

3.5 Quality at Entry:
There was no formal Quality at Entry criteria in effect at project preparation and appraisal. Nevertheless,
the project design followed the essential standards of the Bank Quality Assurance Group regarding: (a)
technical, economic, environmental and social aspects and lessons learned; (b) financial management; and
(c) Borrower's commitment, ownership, participation and readiness for implementation. Project design
was consistent with the Bank's China CAS, which focused on poverty reduction and reducing constraints to
sustained growth, and was finalized after a rigorous peer review process.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
All the Key Performance Indicators show that the project achieved and, in some cases, exceeded several
quantitative targets, which reflect the realization of key outcomes pertaining to the project schools' external
efficiency and strengthening of institutional links with enterprises.

4.2 Outputs by components:

A. Development of Key Institutions for Vocational Education ($56.8 million)

The project has substantially achieved the objective of developing the 80 key project schools (PSs) as
models for upgrading the quality and efficiency of vocational education through (a) course revision and
curriculum development; (b) staff development and training; (c) international and domestic technical
assistance; and (d) upgrading and equipping of laboratories and workshops.            Each PS was assisted
according to its own detailed plan, which focused on one or two major specializations representing the local
or regional economic development priorities. Reform of training focused on making the system more
flexible and responsive to market demands.

(a) Course Revision and Curriculum Development

All the PSs reported successful completion of curriculum restructuring and course revision, which
generally accomodated market signals and the local economy's changing demands for vocational skills.
The curriculum base has been broadened, giving general               education subjects a larger share and


                                                       - 3 -

proportionately reducing specialized courses. Based on students' needs, the new courses stress skill
acquisition and individual development. With a broadened general knowledge base, students could acquire
a balanced skill-mix and gain greater flexibility and adaptability in the fast-changing economy and labor
market. They are also required to achieve competency in computer applications and standard Chinese
language, which strengthen their basic cognitive skills for further learning. The adoption of a course-credit
system has facilitated the introduction of more courses designed as modules of industrial theory and
practice. Teaching methods have become more student-centered.            Practical workshop and laboratory
training have been increased and supported by the provision of new equipment procured under the project.
The replacement of old courses by new courses based on local-economy demands                  demonstrates an
increasing responsiveness to changing market forces. The project achieved significant efficiency gains in
terms of average weekly teaching hours, which increased by 32 percent from the per school average of 11
hours in 1996 to 14.5 hours in 2002, with the biggest gains of 51 percent and 40 percent by Shandong and
Liaoning Provinces.

The appraisal projection of enrollment increase from 42,000 to 60,000 in full-time pre-employment courses
over the project period was far exceeded in reality. The total student enrollment in 2002 was about
200,290, an increase of 170 percent over the baseline enrollment in 1996 of about 117,700. The average
per-school enrollment in 2002 was about 2,500 compared with about 1,470 in 1996. Graduates totalled
over 56,800 of which about 61,600 (about 91 percent) found employment within six months of graduation,
with the highest employment rate of 96 percent in Beijing Municipality and the lowest of about 87 percent
in Shandong Province.

(b) Staff Development and Training

The overall success in achieving the desired reforms in course revision, curriculum development, and
institutional planning and management was due to a well-timed, meticulously planned and sharply focused
program of training selected key specialist teachers and school principals at the Singapore Nanyang
Polytechnic (NYP) and other administrators and teachers locally. The early start of the training at NYP
with follow-up support in China by NYP consultants was critical to the timely planning and initiation of
reforms in the PSs. Central to the NYP training program were two unique concepts of the `Teaching
Factory' and `Integrated Technology Teaching and Learning' (ITL) which served as the pedagogic
foundation for staff and curriculum development as well as for organizing and delivering training. These
concepts provided a common platform for training both the specialist teachers and the principals who
subsequently were equipped with a common frame of reference for designing and implementing the desired
reforms in the PSs. An extension of the above concepts is the `Specialist Center' (SC), an NYP innovation
that also inspired some principals and specialist teachers to establish similar units in their schools. The SC
is designed to provide students with extensive practice and application-oriented training. It allows them to
apply the theoretical concepts they have learnt, thereby enabling them to maximize their understanding and
learning of technology.

The NYP was chosen to provide this technical assistance because of Singapore's good reputation for highly
successful vocational and technical education programs closely linked with industry and the labor market,
and NYP's ability to run the program in Chinese, the latter being a key consideration for avoiding the need
for time-consuming and costly language training for PS staff. Providing the training in Chinese greatly
facilitated the timely and successful implementation of the program.

Key specialist teachers, totalling 82 (including 12 women), were trained at NYP in four groups over a
two-year period, from May 1998 through November 2000, with the following provincial representation (the
number of participants in brackets): Guangdong (16); Shandong (17); Jiangsu (16); Liaoning (12); and


                                                     - 4 -

Beijing (21). The training was provided in four main specializations (the number of participants given in
brackets): Electronics (20); Manufacturing Technology (19); Mechatronics (12); and Information
Technology (31). Each specialization includes a wide range of sub-disciplines. The program upgraded and
enhanced the specialist teachers' technical and professional capabilities to enable them to develop and
introduce up-to-date teaching methods and curricula responsive to industry needs.

School principals, totalling 75, including five women, were also trained in four groups, each group being
given a three-week training dealing with the specializations of the schools represented by the principals.
The training took place over a 20-month period, from December 1997 through August 1999.                  The
provincial representation was as follows (the number of participants in brackets): Guangdong (14);
Shandong (15); Jiangsu (21); Liaoning (15); and Beijing (10).

Domestic seminars, complementing and reinforcing the overseas training, were held to disseminate among
staff of PSs and non-project schools the `good practice' ideas gained from the NYP experience that had a
direct bearing on curriculum reform, course development, and institutional planning and management. A
total of three seminars, presented by returnees from overseas training and NYP experts and dealing with
three main topics, were held in Beijing (October 1999, on Vocational Education), Dalian (July 2001, on
Labor Market Information), and Guangzhou (December 2002, on Vocational School Management).

Domestic staff training operated at provincial level was a key quality input whose outcome is reflected in
the very significant increase in the number of staff from all the project provinces who benefited from
administrative training, pedagogical skill training, and academic qualification upgrading. Across all
provinces, the average percentage of staff trained was about 186 percent for administrators, 493 percent
for qualification upgrading, and 594 percent for skill training over the planned targets. Most significant are
the numbers for the last two categories, which reflect the importance the provinces placed on raising staff
qualifications and improving their teaching skills. The potential long-term impact on quality improvement
may be gauged from the fact that, on average, each PS showed the following results: administrators ­ about
18 trained against 9 planned; academic qualification upgrading - about 32 trained against 6 planned; and
pedagogical skill training - about 44 trained against about 7 planned.

In-service training      benefited nearly 157,500 staff from industry/enterprise trained in the project
provinces, about 233 percent more than the planned target of about 67,700, ranging from about 109
percent for Beijing to 460 percent for Guangdong. The scale of the in-service training is a concrete
demonstration of not only the strengthened links between PS and industry, but also better utilization of
school facilities and staff and increased the income of PSs. This, in turn, has strengthened school financing
from nongovernment sources.

(c) International and Domestic Technical Assistance

The contract with NYP provided for training key teaching staff and administrators in Singapore, described
above, and follow-up services to the PSs by NYP specialists. The specialists assisted the trained key staff
in preparation of courses and related teaching-learning materials and curriculum development. They also
helped the key staff prepare and implement seminars and workshops to disseminate skills in these areas to
other teachers. Nanyang Polytechnic provided 15 experts for follow-up consultations, 5 experts for school
principals in 1999 and 10 experts for teachers in 2000. All the provincial FILOs reported satisfactory
outcomes of the technical assistance received by the PSs, several of which have on their own initiative
established special relations with NYP for the latter to continue its advisory service.

(d) Upgrading of Training Facilities

Project schools' laboratories and workshop facilities were renovated and upgraded through expansion and
adaptation of the existing facilities and the provision of appropriate technology and up-to-date training
equipment. Total civil works construction for the 80 PSs amounted to about 347,400 square meters, or 154
percent of the original estimate. This translated into about 4,300 square meters against the planned 2,800
square meters per PS.      Civil works, financed with counterpart funding, were completed long before
scheduled equipment delivery. Project schools were able to make adjustments in the selection of technology
and specifications appropriate for the restructured and updated programs and courses. The upgraded
facilities, appropriately equipped with selected technology, have improved the teaching/learning
environment and enabled students, teachers and school administrators to carry out the reforms needed to
make the training programs market-oriented, demand-driven and efficiently managed in meeting the
changing demand for new and better skills.

B. Improving Management and Planning of Vocational Education ($1.0 million)

(a) Management Improvement

This was effected through overseas and domestic training of principals and other administrative staff
described above. Post-training evaluation carried out by NYP staff showed that the training enabled
principals to understand the importance of industry linkages and of ensuring the relevance of the
curriculum to commerce and industry in a developing economy. They experienced at first hand the
translation of modern theories of VTE into effective practice in a real-life setting and NYP's approach to
managing and using resources more effectively, including the need for continuous staff development,
capabilities enhancement, and establishing specialist centers.       They recognized the importance of
establishing a total quality management system to ensure that their graduates have acquired the relevant
adaptive skills to meet the evolving demands of modern business and industry.

(b) Improvement of Planning

This is evidenced by principals and other VTE managers placing high value on developing and maintaining
a graduate tracer system as a means of gathering feed-back information to monitor actual developments in
the labor market to ensure that the courses offered by the schools remain relevant to market demands. This
has resulted in improvement in the school-based labor market information system. Reference has been made
above to increased weekly teaching hours in PSs and the over 90 percent employment rate of graduates.
All project provinces have in place a five-year (2003-2007) plan for school information development.

(c) Closer Links with Industry

The establishment in each PS of the school Industrial Advisory Committee (IAC) and the School Governing
Board (SGB) has facilitated closer links with industry. The IAC is the forum for employer participation in
planning and developing training courses and programs and provision of feedback on student performance
following employment, while the SGB represents local industries and businesses.

All the above has resulted in an overall improvement in the management of vocational education offered by
the PSs, with spillover effects in the non-project schools. This is evidenced by (a) market responsiveness
through closer ties with industry; (b) a more flexible, modular approach to vocational training; and (c)
actual practice of student-centered teaching/learning techniques and assessment, with emphasis on
individual development. All the reforms initiated under the project are facilitating the production of a new
generation of technicians with the ability to meet new skill demands in the fast-changing labor market.

C: Project Management Support ($0.4 million)

Decentralized project implementation was achieved through a well-planned and efficiently executed
program of management training for staff from provincial units and PSs in planning, coordination,
procurement, disbursement, and reporting. The Chinese Expert Panel through its strong advisory support
throughout implementation contributed effectively to the strengthening of local capacity, resulting in a
smooth project startup and timely completion.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
No NPV or ERR was calculated for this project.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
No financial rate of return was calculated.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The most important pivotal achievement is the strengthened capacity, albeit varying among schools and
provinces, for institutional planning and management of vocational education brought about initially by the
highly successful training of key specialist teachers and principals at the Singapore NYP, whose innovative
concepts of `Teaching Factory' and `Integrated Technology Teaching and Learning' have, in varying
degrees, been adopted by the PSs. The overseas staff training was reinforced by follow-up in-country
seminars. Institutional development was augmented by the well-planned and executed staff development
program which resulted in thousands of administrators and teachers being trained in modern management
and classroom teaching techniques. The ultimate institutional development impact may be gauged by the
new market-oriented courses and the high employment rate for PS graduates, whose starting salary in 2002
was RMB 800 compared with RMB 700 for a non-project school graduate.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The main factor was the exchange rate fluctuation between the SDR and US dollar. The unfavorable
exchange rates during the project period significantly reduced the credit proceeds available to the project
entities.


5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Special Account for the project was placed under the former Finance Division of the World Bank
Department of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Subsequently, internal reorganization of that department led
to the transfer of the Special Account responsibility to the Financial Transaction Center, a consulting arm
affiliated to MOF. Staff shortage and frequent staff turnover often caused delays and inconsistency in
processing withdrawal applications. This was compounded by poor communication with provincial project
authorities regarding withdrawals and reimbursement eligibility procedures. All these problems combined
with the unfavorable SDR-US dollar exchange rates adversely affected some project provinces. MOF is
encouraged to review its policy with regard to Special Account management and provide oversight on the
staffing and quality of service of the Financial Transaction Center.


5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Project implementation arrangements were excellent, with a clear distribution of responsibilities among all
the concerned entities. At the national level, the National Project Steering Committee (NPSC), chaired by
MOE/FILO, had primary responsibility for overall implementation, aided the Chinese Expert Panel (CEP),



                                                     - 7 -

which provided advisory support to MOE/FILO and the Provincial Education Offices on substantive
aspects of vocational education reform and project implementation and coordination.


5.4 Costs and financing:
Project costs estimated at appraisal were $68.4 million, with $30 million equivalent financed by the Bank
and $38.4 million equivalent by the Government. At project completion, the total project costs amounted to
$74 million equivalent, of which $44 million equivalent had been provided by government counterpart
funding, and the balance by the IDA credit of $20 million equivalent and the IBRD loan of $10 million
equivalent. The $10 million equivalent reflects the additional amount of funding provided by the local
governments in the project provinces and localities to cover the cost of facilities upgrading. As of March
13, 2003, the IDA credit and IBRD loan in the amount of $30.00 million equivalent had been fully
disbursed.


6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The favorable rating is based on five key considerations. First is the strong commitment by the central
government as well as the provincial governments and local authorities to reforming vocational education.
Second is their reliance on the reformed vocational schools to produce the new generation of skilled
workers for the fast-changing market economy. Third is the growing trend towards increasing the share of
school financing from non-government sources which at the end of 2002 was about 31 percent of total
expenditure of schools (TES) for all the project provinces. Significantly, tuition fees accounted for 28
percent of TES, reflecting the increasing willingness of students to pay for their training. Rising incomes in
the urban areas will likely reinforce this trend. Fourth are the plans for post completion school staff training
of three of the five project provinces which show a commitment of over RMB 26 million to training about
6,300 staff; and finally the pilot-tested School Industrial Advisory Committees and School Governing
Boards established in project schools are likely to be institutionalized and adopted by non-project schools.


6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Arrangements by the project provinces, based on PS plans, for regular operations of project schools are
reflected in the post-completion investment plans for three provinces (Guangdong, Shandong and Liaoning)
for the period 2003-2007: (a) for staff training: about RMB 26 million; (b) for civil works maintenance:
about RMB 104 million; (c) for equipment maintenance: about RMB 76 million; and for school
information development: about RMB 102 million.


7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance in lending was satisfactory. Two important Bank sector studies provided the framework
for planning the project: (i) the 1992 study on China's urban employment and wage system (Report No.
10266-CHA), which led to an action plan for reforms in employment and wage structure; and (ii) the 1993
study on the employment and training implications of enterprise reform (Report No. 11785-CHA). The
previous VTE project (Credit 2114-CHA, which closed at the end of 1996) provided the impetus to
designing a more focused investment to assist China address the issues arising from the urgent need to
change to a market-oriented economy. While the VTE project yielded some positive results (improved
internal efficiency, increased self-sufficiency from tuition fees and school-owned enterprises, and improved
access to technical education as evidenced by increased enrollments), its coverage of 17 provinces proved



                                                      - 8 -

to be over-ambitious, its staff training and technical assistance, which depended on participants'
English-language proficiency, lacked relevance and effectiveness. This project was therefore conceived on
the basis of major economic and sector work and drawn on the main thrust of the Bank Policy Paper on
Training as well as lessons learned from Bank-assisted development programs in China and worldwide.

7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision performance was satisfactory.           All partners worked effectively to ensure timely
implementation of project activities. Altogether there were 13 supervision missions which provided timely
support to the central as well as provincial implementing units by focusing attention on the main project
objectives of developing key institutions, curriculum renewal and course revision, and staff development
and training.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Based on the above assessment, overall Bank performance was satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance in preparation was satisfactory. The provinces and Beijing Municipality were
responsible for selecting the schools following agreed criteria, which included (a) current registration as
local-level key institutions; (b) potential for meeting local labor market needs; (c) current enrollment of at
least 1,000 students with plans to increase to about 2,000 over five years; (d) reasonable teaching
conditions and competent management; and (e) demonstrated potential for meeting project objectives and
supporting sustainable development in the post-completion period.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance was satisfactory.               As mentioned in para. 5.3 above,
responsibilities for carrying out and coordinating project activities were clearly delineated and strategically
distributed among national, provincial, local and school authorities. Overall implementation was ably
served by the Chinese Expert Panel.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
MOE/FILO's performance was satisfactory. Its major contribution as the primary implementing agency
was in coordinating project activities carried out at the provincial and school levels, organizing staff
training, domestic seminars and collating the periodic provincial project reports.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, Borrower performance was satisfactory, based on its commitment to reforming the vocational
education system, the bottom-up approach to planning the project and preparing investment plans for
post-implementation operations to ensure project sustainability.

8. Lessons Learned

Project preparation

l A bottom-up approach to project planning, design and implementation facilitates stakeholders
    commitment and ensures successful implementation.
l Reforms in curriculum, teaching-learning methods and student assessment need to be firmly grounded
    in labor market demands.
l Institutional development and its functional relevance to the community and the economy are best
    ensured through links with local enterprises and industries.
l Finalization of a staff training program before credit/loan effectiveness and early implementation will



                                                      - 9 -

    ensure that the trained staff will have adequate time to bring benefits to the project.


Project implementation

l In support of decentralization, implementation responsibilities should be clearly delineated and
    strategically distributed to key agencies at national, provincial, local and institutional levels to ensure
    accountability and smooth coordination of project activities.
l Successful project implementation with multi-provinces/entities depends upon strong local capacity
    built with targeted assistance and dedicated agencies adequately staffed by trained personnel with the
    relevant skills and experience.
l In support of school-based management, establishment of School Boards (Governing Council) and
    Industrial Liaison Committees is an effective mechanism in embracing community participation and
    partnership with industries.
l Decentralized and provincial-based procurement under the guidance of experienced national
    implementing agency accelerates the procurement process, ensures end-user satisfaction, and builds up
    provincial procurement capacity.
l Early procurement training with close attention to contract management issues will facilitate the
    establishment of a mechanism for post-delivery follow-up service to end-users.
l Effective communication between service providers and end-users is essential for assessing user needs
    and providing quality service for ICB procurement.
l Special accounts administered by sector implementing agencies is likely to be more efficient in
    facilitating timely disbursement and reducing delays.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Overview

With the cooperation among the departments related at the central and local levels and the united efforts
contributed by the project schools, the objectives of the Vocational Education Reform Project have been
accomplished. Generally the borrower has no objections to the project description and comments made by
the Bank. The borrower thinks that the narrative part of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
makes an objective and clear description of the project targets, contents, outputs, assessment and
experiences, and the statistics listed in the tables affiliated are trustworthy. On the whole, the borrower
agrees to the viewpoints, analysis and suggestions made in the ICR. According to the credit management
procedures of the World Bank, the borrower will account as follows in terms of project impacts,
performances and sustainability.

Project Impact

As designated in the World Bank Staff Appraisal Report, all the project schools have set up School
Governing Boards (SGBs) and Industrial Advisory Committees (IACs). In general, the School Governing
Boards are composed of the staff from the sectors of education, planning, labor and employers. Meetings
will be held annually or semiannually to provide guidance and make coordination on issues related to
school planning program, school development, reform and employment of graduates. The Industrial
Advisory Committees, led by the educational sector, are composed of the people from employers,
vocational education specialists, principles and backbone teachers of the project schools. Under the
guidance of the School Governing Boards, the Industrial Advisory Committees aim to help making
decisions on school objectives, curriculum development, selection of teaching materials and skill training of
the specialized teachers. As reported by the project provinces and schools, SGBs and IACs have played and




                                                       - 10 -

will play important roles in school planning, curriculum development and employment improvement.

New Vocational Education Concept

Several groups of principals and teachers were trained in Singapore. The trainees come back with new
ideas of teaching factory and course modules integrated with advanced technologies. The course-credit
system and application-oriented instruction are introduced into the project schools and disseminated to
other schools with similar background. The follow-up consultation model undertaken by the Singapore
specialists brings good impacts on the inter-school discussion and exchanges, which broaden their views on
the recent development of theories and practices in vocational education and training. The courses and
teaching materials are revised at different levels considering the fast-changing economy and the demand of
market.

Labor Market Information System

With rapid economic development and transformation of employment system of graduates, the vocational
schools face huge pressure. However, the schools have made adjustments in terms of selection of subjects
and revision of teaching materials and arrangements of theoretical and skill teaching based on the feed-back
of tracer study of the graduates. The Bank-financed equipment will help schools to adopt the computerized
approaches and enhance such practices. Labor market information system is introduced and will play
pivotal roles in building up the capacity of coping with challenges of the market economy.

Performance of the World Bank and the Borrower

The World Bank staff and consultants working on the project possess high professional and managerial
ability. They work harmoniously with the Chinese counterparts in the project life and made many
constructive suggestions while visiting and supervising the project entities and help solve problems. The
Ministry of Education and the World Bank separately or jointly conducted site visits during the project
implementation in all project provinces and the majority of the project schools so as to find and solve
problems timely. The output and outcomes of the project tell that the World Bank and the Borrower have
cooperated well and have fulfilled their duties in executing and supervising the project successfully.

Project Sustainability

In 2002, the Central Government of China held a national conference on vocational education. New
measures have been adopted to solve the existing problems and strengthen the reform and development of
the vocational education sector. At the same time, the project schools, under the guidance of the Ministry of
Education, have developed their own sustainability plans for works maintenance, equipment service, staff
training and school informationalization for the period of 2003-2007.

The project schools are planning to invest US$ equivalent 5 million, 22 million, 12 million and 24 million
respectively for staff training, civil works maintenance, equipment maintenance and school information
construction in the following five years.

On the one hand, the School Governing Boards and the Industrial Advisory Committees will continuously
play roles in school programming and development. On the other hand, the investment will be offered from
the central, provincial and city governments and the maintenance and upgrading fees have been committed
by the project schools. The assistance of the governments at all levels and input program of the project
schools will afford guarantee of the project sustainability.
