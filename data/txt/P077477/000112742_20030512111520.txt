Strategic Context

Sector-related

Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) 
goal supported 
by 
the 
project: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
Document 
number: 
20886 
The 
current 
CAS 
covers 
the 
period 
of 
FY2001-2003. 
The 
next 
CAS 
is 
under 
preparation 
and 
is 
scheduled 
for 
delivery 
in 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
FY2004.  The 
Second 
Local 
Government Development 
Project 
(LGDP 
11) 
was 
originally 
planned 
as 
a 
PRSC 
focussed 
on 
decentralization 
for 
delivery 
in 
FY2004. 
This 
PRSC 
was therefore 
not 
in 
the 
pipeline 
of 
projects 
identified 
in 
the 
FY2001-2003 CAS. 
During 
the 
Mid-Term 
Review 
of 
the 
on-going 
Local 
Government Development 
Program 
(LGDP 
I) 
which 
was 
undertaken 
in 
February 
2002, 
it 
was 
determined that 
the 
capacity 
at 
the 
Local 
Government 
level 
was 
not 
yet 
ready 
for 
the 
PRSC 
modality. 
To 
maintain 
the 
momentum 
of 
reforms 
and 
institutional 
building 
carried 
out under 
LGDP 
I, 
it 
was 
determined that a 
deepening 
of 
the 
achievements 
under 
LGDP 
I 
will 
be 
required. 
The 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
therefore 
provide 
the 
bridge 
between 
LGDP 
I 
and 
the 
decentralization 
PRSC 
which 
is 
envisioned 
in 
the 
next 
CAS 
cycle. 
Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
November 
16, 
2000 
LGDP 
I 
was 
designed 
as 
a 
pilot 
project and 
has 
the 
following 
development 
objectives: 
(a) 
test the 
feasibility 
of 
implementing constitutional and 
legal 
mandates 
with 
respect 
to 
decentralized 
service 
provision 
and 
evolution 
of 
the 
development 
budget; 
(b) 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Local 
Government, 
the 
Local 
Government 
Finance 
Commission 
and a 
sub-set 
of 
local 
govemments 
for 
improved 
service 
delivery, 
accountability 
and 
transparency; 
(c) 
introduce 
and 
test 
alternative 
service 
delivery 
mechanisms 
through private 
sector 
beneficiaries, communities 
and stakeholders; 
and 
(d) 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
project implementation 
for 
actual 
experiences 
and 
good 
practices 
for 
formulating 
an 
appropriate 
strategy, 
implementation 
of 
modalities 
and phasing 
for 
eventual 
scaling 
up 
nationally 
over 
time. 
LGDP 
I1 
would 
incorporate 
the lessons 
learned 
under 
LGDP 
I 
and 
make the 
program 
national 
in 
scale, 
seeking 
to improve 
delivery 
of 
basic services 
to 
support economic 
growth 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Government’s 
decentralization 
policy. 
Uganda’s PRSP 
implementation 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Support 
Credit 
(PRSC) 
with 
the 
prime 
objective 
of 
improving efficient 
allocation 
of 
resources 
and 
service 
delivery. 
The 
PRSC 
also 
supports the 
Plan 
for 
Modernization 
of 
Agriculture 
which 
is 
intended 
to 
develop 
structures 
and 
capacities 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
One 
element 
of 
the 
poverty reduction 
strategy 
which 
needs 
additional 
support 
is 
the 
cross sectoral 
aspect 
of 
decentralization. 
In 
this 
context, 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
intending 
to 
fill 
the 
technical 
and 
financial 
need 
by 
providing 
the 
much 
needed 
support 
for 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
decentralization 
program 
in 
Uganda.

As 
indicated 
in 
the CAS, 
one 
of 
the 
areas 
IDA’S 
future 
lending program 
and 
portfolio 
improvement 
strategy 
should 
focus 
on 
is 
the 
decentralization 
from 
the 
center 
to 
the 
district 
councils 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
a 
major 
challenge 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
and 
already 
affects 
the 
implementation 
of 
some 
projects, 
particularly 
agriculture extension 
and social 
sector 
interventions. 
Local 
capacity 
must 
be 
strengthened; 
sound procedures 
for 
funding 
district 
councils 
must 
be 
adopted; 
and 
a 
solid 
framework 
for 
accountability 
needs 
to 
be 
established. Therefore, 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
an important program 
of 
reform 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
Bank’s 
CAS 
and 
the 
country’s 
PRSP 
agenda. 
This 
makes 
the 
LGDP 
I1 
resources necessary 
for 
the 
government 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
and 
the 
grant nature 
of 
it 
will 
ensure 
that 
GOU 
can 
borrow 
and 
not 
hamper 
its 
progress 
towards 
debt 
sustainability. 
In 
addition, 
the 
grant 
element 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
and 
PRSC 
will 
signal 
to 
the 
GOU, the Bank’s 
commitment 
to 
helping 
Uganda achieve 
its 
debt 
targets. 
Transfers 
to 
the 
local 
governments 
are 
programmed 
at 
around 
34 
percent 
per 
annum 
currently 
in 
the 
budget 
and 
of 
this 
IDA 
is 
the 
single 
major 
donor 
financier 
through 
its 
support 
through 
PRSC 
and 
LGDP 
II. 
This 
is 
undoubtedly central 
to 
addressing the economic 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
agenda 
in 
Uganda. 
Given 
that 
the 
current 
CAS 
was 
prepared 
prior 
to 
the 
introduction 
of 
the 
IDA 
Grants 
in 
September 
2002, 
the 
allocation 
of 
the use 
of 
the grants 
in 
Uganda 
will 
be 
covered 
in 
the 
next CAS. 
It 
is 
expected that 
the 
IDA 
grants 
will 
be 
allocated 
to 
the 
PRSC 
in 
the 
upcoming 
CAS. 
LGDP 
I1 
(in 
addition to 
PRSC) 
was 
selected 
for 
grant 
financing 
because 
of: 
(1) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) 
(5) 
its 
complementary 
character 
in 
Bank’s Uganda 
program 
in 
addressing 
poverty 
reduction 
together 
with 
PRSC; 
the project’s 
innovative 
approach 
to 
donor 
collaboration 
in 
supporting 
the decentralization 
process 
which 
is 
central 
to 
Uganda’s 
development 
challenges; 
the GOU’s commitment 
to reducing 
the 
debt 
burden 
has 
placed 
unfair 
burden 
on 
the 
smooth 
implementation 
of 
the 
Poverty 
Eradication 
Action 
Plan 
(PEAP) 
and decentralization 
program; 
the 
GOU 
also 
feels that 
the 
popular 
support 
and commitment 
to 
the 
decentralization 
initiative 
will 
be 
strengthened 
by 
the 
grant 
financing;  and 
LGDP 
I1 
has 
a 
significant capacity 
building 
component. 
Decentralization 
in 
Uganda 
’s 
CAS: 
Given 
the 
increasing 
share 
of 
fiscal 
decentralization 
in 
Uganda, the 
LGDP 
I1 
operation 
supports 
the 
decentralization program 
both 
at 
the 
level 
of 
institutional 
development 
and 
the 
financial 
resources. 
In 
addition, 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
complementary 
to 
PRSC2 and 3 
and 
will 
promote 
achievement 
of 
the 
PEAP 
objectives. 
In 
the 
current CAS, 
one 
of 
the 
key 
lessons 
of 
OED‘s 
Country 
Assistance 
Evaluation 
for 
Uganda 
stressed 
that 
the 
Bank 
should 
address 
decentralization 
in 
depth. 
Strong 
Development 
Impacts: 
This 
particular 
operation 
is 
essential also 
because 
it 
is 
an 
instrument 
to 
mobilize 
broad 
grant support 
around 
the 
decentralization 
process. 
This 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
stronger 
demonstration effects 
for 
the 
future. 
Government 
preferences: 
Government 
has 
expressed 
particular 
interest 
in 
grant 
financing 
for 
the 
decentralization 
program 
because 
they 
see 
it 
as 
a 
means 
to 
draw 
greater 
and 
broader support 
for 
this 
cross 
cutting reform 
program. 
In 
addition, 
this 
reduces the government’s 
burden 
on 
debt 
build 
up 
which 
has 
been 
a concem 
as 
the 
debt 
service 
ratio 
has 
reached 
unfavorable 
levels.

0 
Evidence 
of

gap 
between budgeted 
and

Evidence 
of 
progress 
in

Monitoring 
System 
and 
Results. 
Since the 
inception 
of 
LGDP 
there 
has 
been 
considerable 
attention 
given 
to 
developing 
a systematic 
performance 
monitoring 
system. 
Under 
LGDP 
1, 
IDA 
assisted 
with 
the 
development 
of 
the software 
necessary 
for 
systematic 
input 
and 
output monitoring. 
Under 
LGDP 
11, 
this 
system 
will 
be 
rolled 
out 
and 
training provided 
for 
staff 
responsible 
for 
Monitoring 
and Evaluation 
(M&E) 
such 
that 
monitoring 
information 
will 
be 
generated systematically. 
IDA 
resources 
will 
be 
channeled 
to 
the Consolidated 
Fund 
based 
on 
the annual 
LG 
assessments 
which 
will 
be 
carried out 
in 
AugusdSeptember each year 
to 
identify 
the 
LGs 
which 
will 
be 
eligible 
for 
LG 
Development 
Grant. 
Similarly, 
other donors 
will 
also channel 
their 
resources based 
on 
the 
agreed 
criteria. 
These 
will 
ensure that a transparent and coherent 
monitoring 
system 
is 
available 
to 
assess 
the 
eligibility 
of 
LGs 
and 
appropriate resources 
are 
channeled 
into 
the Consolidated 
Fund. 
In 
addition, 
since 
IDA’S 
resources are 
provided 
increasingly 
as 
budget 
support, 
GOU 
has 
developed a 
systematic budget 
performance 
monitoring 
which 
reports 
on 
resource 
utilization. 
Currently, 
GOU 
produces quarterly, 
half 
yearly 
and annual reports 
on 
details 
of 
budget 
execution 
which 
provides 
vital 
information 
for 
monitoring 
the 
program. 
In 
addition, the 
Poverty 
Action 
Fund 
(PAF) 
monitoring 
system, 
which 
was 
set 
up 
by 
GOU 
in 
1998 
as 
a 
mechanism 
for 
monitoring 
the 
channeling 
of 
HIPCs 
debt 
relief 
into 
spending 
programs, 
directly 
supports 
poverty 
programs. 
This 
system has a 
detailed 
output 
monitoring 
system 
which 
covers a 
large 
part 
of 
LG 
activities. 
In 
addition, 
every 
year 
the 
GOU 
produces 
a PRSP progress 
report 
which 
provides 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
PRSP 
implementation 
which 
comments 
on 
the service 
delivery 
and 
LG 
performance. 
Also, 
annual 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(PER) 
reports 
provide detailed 
analysis 
of 
central 
and 
LG 
budget 
performance and 
concerns. 
All 
these 
will 
be 
complemented 
with 
the 
periodic national 
service 
delivery 
surveys 
which 
will 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
decentralized 
service 
delivery 
programs. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
The 
Government’s  strategy 
for 
economic 
transformation 
is 
spelled 
out 
in 
its 
PEAP, a 
medium-term 
development 
plan 
that 
guides 
government 
policy 
and 
provides 
a 
framework 
for 
detailed 
sector 
and 
local 
government 
plans. 
The 
PEAP 
was 
first 
drafted 
in 
1997, 
after 
18 
months 
of 
consultation 
with 
key 
stakeholders. 
It 
was 
revised 
in 
the 
MarcWApril 
of 
2000 
and 
a summary 
of 
the 
revised 
PEAP 
was 
presented 
as 
Uganda’s 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper 
to 
the 
boards 
of 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
in 
May 
2000. 
The 
PRSP focuses 
on 
four 
key 
pillars: 
(a) 
creating 
an enabling 
environment 
for 
economic 
growth 
and 
structural transformation; 
(b) 
ensuring 
good 
governance 
and 
security, 
including 
improvement 
in 
public 
service 
deliveiy 
and decentralization; 
(c) 
directly 
increasing 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
poor 
to 
raise 
their 
incomes; 
-4- 
Page  9
and 
(d) 
directly 
increasing 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
the poor. 
A 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
Government’s strategy 
is 
its 
decentralization 
policy. 
This 
policy 
is 
mandated 
by 
the 
1995 
constitution, 
and 
its 
basic structure 
is 
laid 
out 
in 
the 
1997 
Local 
Governments 
Act. 
It 
is 
further 
elaborated 
in 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
Planning and Economic 
Development 
“Letter 
of 
Sector 
Policy on 
Fiscal 
Devolution, 
Control 
and Management 
of 
Public 
Expenditure” 
of 
October 
1999, 
which 
was 
a. 
joint 
letter 
for 
LGDP 
I 
and Second 
Economic 
and 
Financial 
Management Project 
(EFMP 
11). 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note that 
local 
governments 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
implementation 
of 
the 
Government’s PEAP/PRSP, 
including primary 
education 
and health, 
as 
well 
as 
physical 
infrastructure. 
Thus, 
the 
evolving 
relationships between central and 
local 
governments, 
including 
most 
sectors, 
is 
crucial 
to 
the 
success 
of 
Government’s  strategy. 
These 
relationships 
include 
inter 
alia 
fiscal 
and 
institutional 
capacity 
dimensions. 
Also 
of 
vital 
concern 
for 
the 
strategy 
is 
downward 
accountability 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
based 
on 
transparent 
and 
highly 
participatory decision 
making 
and 
monitoring 
of 
implementation. 
LGDP 
I 
was designed 
as 
a demand-driven 
project, 
with 
its 
implementation carried out 
in 
the context 
of 
hard 
budget 
constraints, transparent 
eligibility 
and 
access 
criteria 
for 
participating 
in 
the 
project 
aimed 
at 
achieving 
improved 
service 
delivery 
standards. 
LGDP 
I 
provides 
a 
modality 
for 
transferring 
development 
funds 
from 
the 
Center 
to 
the 
local 
governments 
in 
line 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Constitution 
(1995), 
and 
the 
Local 
Governments 
Act, 
1997, 
as 
amended. 
This 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
services 
that 
have 
been mandated 
to 
the 
local 
governments are 
not only 
sustainable, 
delivered 
on 
a 
timely 
basis, 
and 
with 
value 
for 
money, 
but 
also 
are 
delivered 
through 
a process 
which 
is 
fully 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
law 
and 
regulations. 
Those 
local 
governments 
which 
have 
accessed 
the 
funding 
will 
only 
continue 
receiving 
this 
funding 
if 
they 
continue 
to 
meet 
the 
minimum 
conditions. 
The internal and 
the 
national 
assessments 
determine 
the 
level 
of 
performance, against a 
set 
of 
predetermined indicators, 
of 
the 
beneficiary 
local 
governments.  Those 
which 
score 
favorably 
against 
the 
indicators have 
a 
reward 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
increase 
by 
20% 
of 
the 
allocation 
of 
the 
previous 
year 
while 
others 
scoring 
below 
a 
minimum 
threshold 
have 
their 
previous 
year’s 
allocation reduced 
by 
20%. 
Under 
tranche 
1 
of 
LGDP 
I, 
development 
grants were 
provided 
to 
54 
HLGs, 
increasing 
to 
65 
HLGs 
under 
tranche 3 
out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
74 
HLGs. 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
conceived 
as 
the second phase 
of 
LGDP 
I. 
It 
will 
involve 
all 
74 
HLGs 
and 
more 
than 1000 
lower 
level local 
governments 
(LLGs). 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
results 
of 
the 
LGDP 
I 
Development Grant 
tranches 
1 
& 
2 was 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
Uganda. 
Under 
tranche 
1, 
a 
total 
of 
1,896 
projects 
were completed, 
and the overall 
quality 
of 
86% 
of 
those 
projects 
were 
rated 
as 
satisfactory 
or 
higher 
by 
the 
respective 
local 
governments. 
Under 
tranche 
2, 
a 
total 
of 
2,849 
projects were 
completed and 
88% 
of 
those 
projects 
were 
rated 
as 
satisfactory 
or 
higher. 
The 
total 
cost 
of 
the 
completed projects 
in 
tranche 
1 
was 
Ush 
10.6 
billion 
and 
Ush 
18.8 
billion 
in 
tranche 
2. 
The 
average 
cost 
of 
all 
investments 
in 
tranche 
1 
was US$2,773 
while 
in 
tranche 
2 
it 
was 
USS3,609. 
The LGDP-financed projects 
created 
significant 
employment at the 
local level 
since 
the 
projects 
were 
generally 
labor 
intensive. 
Labor 
represented 
31% 
of 
the 
total project 
costs 
in 
tranche 
1 
and 
24% 
in 
tranche 
2. 
The 
participation 
of 
female 
workers 
in 
LGDP 
projects 
was 
also 
significant 
with 
about 17% 
of 
the 
total 
person 
days 
being 
provided 
by 
women 
in 
tranche 
1 
and 
24% 
in 
tranche 
2. 
An 
analysis 
of 
the investments 
financed 
from 
tranches 
1 
and 
2 
by 
sectors 
indicates consistency 
with 
the 
National 
Program 
Priority 
Areas, 
namely education 
(30%), 
roads 
(25%), 
health 
(lo%), 
sanitatioddrainage 
(lo%), 
water 
(14%). 
The total 
development 
grants 
to 
LGs 
in 
2001/2002 
amounted 
to 
US80.3 
million, 
of 
which 
the 
share 
of 
LGDP 
I 
was 
US17.8 
million. 
For 
2002/03, 
LGDP 
I 
share 
of 
the 
total 
development 
grants 
was 
US22.7 
million 
out 
of 
US$82.9 
million. 
Under 
LGDP 
11, 
the 
LGD 
grants 
would 
increase 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
folding 
in 
of 
other 
bilateral 
grants 
into 
the 
program and the 
increased 
IDA 
resources.

Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
As 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
I 
took 
hold, 
it 
became 
evident 
to 
Government 
that there was a 
fundamental 
inconsistency between 
numerous, sector 
specific 
and conditional 
grants 
to 
local 
governments 
(primarily 
donor 
supported) 
and the discretionary 
development 
budget 
support 
to 
local 
governments 
(LGs) 
provided 
under 
LGDP 
I. 
The 
discretionary 
development 
budget 
support 
has 
little 
conditionality 
with 
respect 
to 
sector 
allocation 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
leaving 
these 
allocation 
decisions 
to 
be 
made 
according 
to 
local 
priorities 
defined through 
a transparent 
and 
participatory 
decision-making 
process, 
thus 
providing 
an 
emphasis 
on 
downward 
accountability 
to 
local 
communities. 
In 
contrast, sector 
specific 
and 
highly 
conditional 
grants 
to 
local 
governments 
primarily 
promote accountability 
upward, 
to 
the 
sector 
ministry 
or 
special purpose 
fund 
providing 
the 
conditional 
grant. 
The 
Government 
undertook 
a 
study 
on 
fiscal 
decentralization 
in 
200 
1, 
and 
this 
has 
evolved 
in 
the 
development 
of 
its 
Fiscal Decentralization 
Strategy 
, 
the 
piloting 
of 
which 
was 
approved 
by 
Cabinet 
in 
June 
2002. 
Through 
the 
FDS, the 
Government 
has 
made 
the 
strategic 
choice 
to 
mainstream 
the 
LGDP 
approach 
to fiscal 
decentralization, emphasizing 
improvement 
in 
decentralization 
of 
public 
service 
delivery through 
greater 
autonomy and 
downward accountability 
of 
local 
governments. 
LGDP 
I1 
directly 
supports 
this 
strategic 
choice 
of 
Government, and 
other 
donors 
are 
increasingly supportive 
of 
this 
approach.  These 
donors 
are 
demonstrating 
a 
willingness 
to 
replace numerous, sector 
specific conditional 
grants 
with 
discretionary 
development 
budget 
support 
that 
comprise a predictable, transparent 
and 
sustainable 
intergovernmental 
fiscal 
transfer 
system 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
(a) 
the 
legal 
mandates 
for 
local 
government service 
delivery, 
(b) 
a 
significant 
local 
revenue 
base 
that 
is 
effectively 
mobilized, 
and 
(c) 
an 
overall 
hard 
budget 
constraint 
on 
fiscal 
transfers 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
sound macroeconomic 
fundamentals. 
Throughout 
the 
Region, 
a 
key 
issue 
affecting 
the 
local 
government sector 
is 
the 
sustainability 
of 
local 
government investments. 
To 
adequately 
address 
this 
issue 
requires 
that the 
technical, 
financial 
and 
planning 
capacities 
of 
the 
LGs 
to properly 
operate 
and 
maintain 
these 
investments 
be 
strengthened. 
The 
Mid-Term 
Review 
(MTR) 
of 
LGDP 
I 
also 
has 
flagged 
this 
issue, 
as 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
local 
governments 
are 
having 
difficulty 
in 
providing 
the 
ten 
percent 
investment counterpart requirement 
as 
a 
condition 
for 
receiving 
local 
development 
grants 
for new 
capital 
investments. 
The 
MTR 
also 
flagged 
significant, 
recent declines 
in 
local 
government own-source revenue 
mobilization. 
This 
increases the 
concern that 
the 
sustainability 
of 
new 
investments 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
LGDP 
11, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
capital 
stock 
existing 
at 
the 
launch 
of 
LGDP 
II, 
could 
be 
undermined. 
A 
strategic 
principle 
for 
the 
design 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
(as 
well 
as 
for 
implementation 
of 
Government’s 
FDS) 
is 
that 
only (with 
very 
rare 
exceptions) 
local 
governments 
that 
are 
financially 
viable should 
be 
making 
new 
investments. 
The 
principle 
of 
financial 
viability 
would 
mean 
a 
local 
government 
should be 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
that the 
new 
investment, 
as 
well 
as 
existing 
capital 
stock, 
will 
be 
adequately operated 
and maintained. 
Thus, 
access 
to 
local 
development grants 
for 
capital 
investments 
(see 
section 
C. 
1) 
will 
be 
conditioned 
to 
the 
local 
government 
demonstrating 
its 
ability 
to 
have 
adequate 
financial 
resources 
for 
counterpart 
funds 
(current 
account 
surplus) 
for 
the 
operation and 
maintenance 
of 
existing 
investments 
as 
well 
as 
those 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
LGDP 
II. 
For 
local 
governments 
that 
do 
not 
meet 
the 
financial 
viability 
criterion 
for 
access 
to local 
development 
grants, 
support 
will 
be 
available 
to 
assist 
them 
to 
meet 
this 
criterion 
in 
the 
future 
under 
the 
proposed 
local 
government capacity 
building 
and 
local 
government 
revenue 
enhancement 
components 
of 
LGDP 
II. 
This 
principle 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
Government’s FDS, 
and 
it 
would 
also 
be 
a strategic 
part 
of 
the 
design 
of 
a 
future 
decentralization 
PRSC. 
In 
summary, a strategic 
choice 
under 
the 
project 
is 
to 
provide 
incentives 
for 
sound 
local 
government 
fiscal 
performance, 
sanctions 
for 
under-performance, 
and 
support 
to 
improve 
performance.

The project 
has 
five 
components: 
(Annex 
2 
details 
description 
of 
the 
project 
components) 
Component 
1 
- 
Support 
for 
the 
Decentralization 
Process. 
This 
component 
consists 
of 
activities 
to 
support 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
LGs 
to 
plan 
and 
implement projects 
which 
will 
be 
funded 
by 
the 
Local 
Government Development 
Grant 
(Component 
2), 
activities 
to 
support the 
development 
of 
a 
national 
LG 
capacity 
building 
strategy 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Human 
Resource 
Development 
(HRD) 
functions 
in 
LGs, 
and 
support 
of 
annual 
workshops 
through 
which 
progress 
towards decentralization 
in 
Uganda 
will 
be 
assessed, 
and establishment 
of 
an analytical 
and 
design 
basis 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
decentralization 
budget 
support 
instrument. 
It 
would 
also 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
national 
assessment 
system, 
operationalization 
of 
the 
planning 
guidelines 
and 
information 
systems, 
and 
audits 
of 
the accounts 
of 
all 
LLGs 
for 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the 
Project. 
Component 
2 
- 
Local 
Development 
Grants. 
This 
component 
will 
continue 
and extend 
the 
financing 
of 
local 
infrastructure investment 
through 
supporting 
a 
system 
of 
central-local 
intergovernmental 
transfers. 
Component 
3 
- 
Local 
Government Capacity 
Building. 
This 
component 
will 
provide 
capacity 
building 
grants 
to 
LGs. 
Component 
4 
- 
Local 
Government 
Revenue Enhancement. 
This 
component 
will 
finance 
technical 
assistance 
at 
both 
the 
policy 
and operational 
levels. 
Component 
5- 
Support 
to 
Project 
Implementation. 
This 
component 
will 
consist 
of 
activities 
to 
support 
project 
management, 
monitoring, evaluation 
and 
audits 
of 
the 
accounts 
of 
the 
Project.

2. 
Key 
policy 
and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported by 
the 
project: 
The 
Government 
of 
Uganda 
(Cabinet) endorsed 
the 
FDS 
in 
mid-2002. 
LGDP 
will 
lead 
the 
primary 
modality 
for 
the 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
decentralization 
of 
the 
development 
budget 
under 
the 
FDS. 
It 
is 
intended 
that 
the 
grant 
system 
initiated 
through 
LGDP 
will 
become a 
fundamental 
feature 
of 
the 
intergovernmental 
fiscal 
framework 
in 
Uganda 
during 
the 
life 
of 
the 
operation and 
thereafter. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
As 
all 
Ugandans 
live 
in 
a 
local 
government 
jurisdiction, 
all 
would 
be 
potential 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
Project. 
Through implementation 
of 
an efficient, 
equitable and 
sustainable 
intergovernmental 
fiscal 
system, 
all 
local 
authorities should 
have the resources 
to 
meet 
at 
least 
minimum 
service 
level 
standards 
and 
coverage.  Thus, 
beneficiaries 
should include 
local 
govemments and 
their 
institutions 
and 
their 
constituents, 
as 
well 
as 
private 
contractors 
for 
implementation 
of 
substantial 
parts 
of 
local 
government 
programs. 
Specific 
benefits 
may 
not 
be 
identified 
at 
this 
time. 
However, 
based 
on 
current 
experience, 
typical 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be: 
(i) 
employment 
generation, 
open 
up 
markets, 
promote 
increased 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
services; 
(ii) 
improved 
public 
health 
and 
environmental 
conditions; 
(iii) 
decreased 
production 
costs due 
to 
lower 
vehicle 
maintenance and 
transport 
costs 
resulting 
from 
road 
improvements; 
(iv) 
greater 
empowerment 
of 
local 
communities and improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life; 
and 
(v) 
improved 
environmental 
management 
of 
local 
government 
capital 
works. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
The 
overall 
project implementation 
period 
is 
4 
years. 
The 
institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements 
for 
the 
projects 
will 
be 
as 
follows: 
(i) 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
Planning 
and 
Economic 
Development 
(MoFPED) 
is 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
macro-economic 
stability. 
Since the 
National 
Planning 
Authority 
is 
not 
yet 
operational, 
the 
MoFPED 
is 
also responsible 
for 
coordinating 
all 
development plans 
at 
the 
national level. 
Districtlmunicipal 
councils 
are 
required 
to develop 
three year 
rolling 
development plans 
incorporating 
investment plans 
from 
lower 
Local 
Governments 
(LGs). 
MoFPED 
receives 
the development investment plans 
from 
the 
districts/municipalities 
and incorporates 
them 
in 
the 
overall 
national 
investment 
budget. 
Disbursements 
to 
LGs 
under 
components 2 
and 
3 
of 
the 
Project shall 
be 
made 
by 
MoFPED 
based 
on 
the 
advice 
of 
the 
MoLG 
on 
whether a 
LG 
has 
met 
the 
access 
requirements 
for 
receiving 
both 
the 
development 
and 
capacity 
building 
grants 
or only 
the 
capacity 
building 
grant. 
(ii) 
Ministry 
of 
Local 
Government 
(MOLG). 
MoLG 
will 
be 
the 
executing 
ministry 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
and 
also 
the 
agency responsible 
for 
Components 
1,4 
& 
5. 
MoLG 
will 
manage 
the 
project 
by 
coordinating 
the 
activities 
across 
the 
various 
components 
and 
evaluating 
LGs' 
performance 
with 
respect 
to 
project 
implementation. 
The 
primary role 
of 
MoLG 
is 
inspection, 
monitoring 
and coordination 
of 
LGs. 
In 
addition, 
MoLG will 
be 
responsible 
for 
advising 
and 
publishing 
the 
transfers 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
and 
accountability. 
MoLG 
will 
also, 
where 
necessary, 
offer 
training 
and technical 
advice 
to 
LGs, 
do 
compliance 
verification 
and 
mentor 
those 
LGs 
which 
have 
qualified 
for 
access 
to 
funds 
under 
Components 
2 
& 
3 
to 
enhance 
and 
improve 
their 
performances. 
MoLG 
will 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
performance 
of 
LGs 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
national 
policies, regulations, 
standards, 
procedures 
and 
adherence 
to 
guidelines. 
Local 
Governments 
which 
fail 
to 
comply 
with 
such 
performance 
measures 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
sanctions. 
A 
Program 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCLJ), 
currently 
the 
Project 
Management 
Unit 
(PMU), 
will 
support 
MoLG 
in 
the 
management 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
various 
Project 
activities. 
The 
PCU 
will 
provide technical 
back-up 
support 
to 
MoLG 
and 
ensure 
that 
MoLG 
gradually 
take 
over

responsibility 
for 
the 
non-Project 
specific 
management tasks 
in

with 
the

strategy. 
This 
strategy 
is 
important 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
Project after 
2005/2006.

to 
be 
a central 
pillar 
for LGDP

mechanism. 
It 
will 
be 
done 
in 
two 
phases: 
(i) 
the 
internal 
assessment 
by 
the 
District/Municipality 
of 
their 
sub 
counties/division and 
town 
councils; and 
(ii) 
the 
national 
assessment 
team 
will 
assess 
the 
District/Municipality 
during 
August/September 
of 
every 
year. 
On 
basis 
of 
reports 
from 
the 
internal 
assessment 
and 
national 
assessment, 
an 
independent 
assessment 
team 
(comprising 
both local 
and 
international 
experts) 
will 
annually 
appraise 
the 
assessment 
process. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
LGDP 
I1 
could 
have 
pursued 
the 
pilot 
and 
testing 
mode 
of 
the 
first 
project. 
However, the 
MTR 
(February 
2002) 
provided 
broad, 
positive 
results 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
development 
objectives 
of 
LGDP 
I. 
Based 
on 
this 
evaluation, 
the 
Government 
officially 
requested, 
in 
April 
2002, 
that 
the 
Bank 
support 
-9- 
Page  14
preparation 
of 
LGDP 
11, 
based 
on 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
MTR. 
Although 
the 
MTR 
provided 
generally 
positive 
feedback, 
it 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
it 
also 
highlighted 
serious 
concerns, 
most 
notably 
the 
weakening 
of 
local 
government resource 
mobilization. 
In 
response 
to 
this 
concem, the proposed 
LGDP 
I1 
includes 
a 
new 
component 
for 
local 
government revenue 
enhancement. 
Some 
consideration 
was 
given 
to 
following 
up 
on LGDP 
I 
with 
a PRSC. 
This 
alternative 
was 
rejected 
as 
too 
risky. 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
viewed 
as 
a 
“bridge” 
between 
LGDP 
I 
(piloting 
and 
testing 
instruments 
to 
support 
improved 
local 
government service 
delivery, 
and 
not including 
all 
local 
governments) 
and 
a 
potential 
decentralization 
PRSC. 
During 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
11, 
Govemment 
will 
evaluate the 
pilot 
phase 
of 
its 
Fiscal 
Decentralization 
Strategy, 
adjust 
the 
strategy 
as 
appropriate, 
and 
begin 
implementation 
in 
all 
local 
governments. 
The 
MTR 
and 
draft Implementation Completion Report 
(ICR) 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
provide 
important 
inputs 
for 
the 
Government 
and the 
Bank 
to 
evaluate 
the 
potential 
benefits 
and 
risks 
of 
a 
future 
decentralization PRSC that 
ideally 
would 
be 
initiated 
as 
LGDP 
11 
is 
closing.

A 
key 
design 
feature 
of 
LGDP 
I 
was 
to 
incorporate 
the 
findings 
of 
Uganda's 
Participatory Poverty 
Assessment 
Report 
which 
details 
the 
perceptions 
and 
insights 
of 
the 
poor 
with 
regard 
to 
various 
aspects 
such 
as 
the nature 
of 
poverty, socialleconomic 
strategies, 
serviceslinfrastructure, 
governance, 
and 
security. 
The 
report's 
findings 
as 
to 
what 
may 
be 
required 
for 
better 
delivery 
of 
services 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
the 
poor 
communities were 
incorporated 
in 
the 
participatory 
consultative 
process 
with 
the 
beneficiary 
communities. 
In 
addition, a 
detailed 
Community 
Participation 
Review 
exercise was 
conducted 
in 
the 
early 
preparatory 
stage 
of 
LGDP 
I 
to 
analyze and document 
various demand-driven 
approaches 
to 
investment 
planning, 
decision 
making 
and implementation. 
This 
analysis 
provided 
the 
basis 
for 
defining 
the 
participatory 
approach 
to 
the 
project drawing 
on 
the 
best 
practices that 
were 
identified. 
Most 
government projects, 
however, have tended 
to 
be 
"top-down'' 
with 
"vertical 
or 
parallel" 
structures 
although 
quite 
a 
number 
of 
projects 
in 
Uganda 
have been 
conceptualized 
and implemented 
using 
the 
participatory 
approach, 
mainly 
by 
NGOs. 
These 
projects 
omitted 
and/or 
limited 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
key 
stakeholders 
or 
target 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
decision 
making 
and implementation 
phase. 
As 
a 
result, 
such 
projects 
have 
been 
regarded 
as 
"external", 
lacking 
beneficiary 
support, 
commitment, 
and 
ownership 
and, 
therefore, have 
not 
been 
sustainable. 
In 
this 
context, the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
these 
previous activities include: 
(i) 
Lack 
of 
community 
consultation 
resulting 
in 
adverse 
public 
reaction; 
(ii) 
Lack 
of 
ownership 
due 
to 
inadequate 
involvement 
of 
the 
client 
in 
the 
decision 
making 
process; 
(iii) 
Unsustainable 
investments 
due 
to 
inadequate 
attention 
to 
operations and maintenance; 
and 
(iv) 
Inadequate 
capacity 
of 
the 
client 
to 
effectively 
manage 
investment 
contracts. 
Successful 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
I 
has 
been 
dependent 
on 
a strong 
sense 
of 
ownership 
by 
the 
clients,

the

of 
LGDP 
I 
provided 
the 
following 
main 
conclusions: 
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
The 
project 
development 
objectives 
are 
still 
relevant and 
achievable 
by 
the 
project; 
Capital 
investment 
in 
local 
infrastructure 
by 
local 
authorities, 
funded 
by 
the 
LGDP, 
have 
been 
generally proceeding 
successfully; 
Progress 
with 
ensuring the sustainability 
of 
local 
service 
delivery 
has 
been 
slow-this 
is 
particularly 
evident 
in 
the 
area 
of 
local 
resource 
mobilization; 
Improvements 
have 
been achieved 
in 
the 
capacity 
and 
understanding 
by 
local 
governments 
of 
their 
roles 
and responsibilities, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
planning, 
budgeting 
and 
financial 
management; 
and 
There 
is 
a 
need 
to 
review 
the 
annual 
LG 
national 
assessment 
process, 
specifically 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
content, procedures 
(possibilities 
for 
appeal), 
and 
institutional/structral 
issues. 
e) 
Thus, 
the 
main 
lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
partial 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
I 
are 
that 
its 
design 
is 
basically 
sound 
and that 
its 
key 
components 
(support 
for 
the 
decentralization 
process; 
local 
development 
grants; 
local 
government 
capacity 
building; 
and 
support 
to 
project 
implementation) 
merit 
continued 
support 
under the proposed 
project. 
However, the 
MTR 
also 
concluded 
that the 
Government’s decentralization 
policy could 
be 
undermined 
if 
the 
performance 
of 
local 
governments 
in 
mobilizing 
their 
own-source 
revenues 
is 
not improved 
substantially, 
urgently, and 
in 
a sustainable manner. These lessons 
learned 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
proposed 
component 
for 
local 
government 
revenue enhancement. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and 
ownership: 
At 
the 
policy 
level, 
the 
strongest 
indicator 
of 
the 
Government’s commitment and 
ownership 
is 
its 
Fiscal 
Decentralization 
Strategy (FDS). 
The 
FDS 
consolidates 
lessons 
learned 
from 
several 
prior 
initiatives 
that 
aimed 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
the 
1995 
Constitution’s 
mandate 
for 
decentralization 
of 
a substantial 
proportion 
of 
the 
nation’s 
governance, 
including 
its 
first 
Poverty Eradication 
Action 
Plan. 
This 
plan 
clearly articulated 
the 
Government’s 
priorities 
for 
poverty 
reduction, 
and 
decentralization 
was 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
approach, 
as 
it 
continues 
to 
be 
under 
its 
PRSP. 
The 
Government’s 
commitment 
and 
ownership 
has 
also 
been 
firmly 
demonstrated 
through 
its 
strong 
support 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
I. 
Based 
on 
the 
MTR 
recommendations, a 
workshop 
on 
preliminary 
preparation 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
was 
held 
in 
June 
2002. 
This 
workshop 
was attended 
by 
more 
than 
85 
participants 
from 
government 
and 
the 
donor 
community, and 
a 
broad 
consensus 
was agreed 
to 
on 
LGDP 
I1 
design 
principles and 
the proposed 
components 
of 
the 
project. 
Also, the 
Cabinet approved 
in 
principle, 
in 
July 
2002, 
the 
design 
of 
LGDP 
11, 
based 
on 
the 
MTR 
evaluation 
and 
recommendations. 
5. 
Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
At 
the 
workshop 
noted 
above, 
there was 
a 
broadening 
consensus 
that 
the 
LGDP 
I 
“model” 
is 
consistent 
with 
Uganda’s 
constitutional provisions 
for 
decentralized 
governance 
and 
its 
PRSP 
in 
general, 
and 
with 
the 
Government’s 
decentralization 
policy 
in 
particular. 
As 
noted 
in 
Section 
B.3, a 
key 
element 
of 
this 
“model” 
is 
the 
unconditional 
grants 
that promote 
downward 
accountability. 
This 
is 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
programs 
of 
most 
other donors 
that channel 
funds 
conditioned 
to 
their 
use 
for 
sector-specific 
endeavors 
andor 
with 
limited 
geographic coverage. 
The Bank 
is 
broadly 
viewed, 
by 
Government 
and increasingly 
- 
12 
- 
Page  17
by 
other 
donors, 
as 
providing 
a 
unique 
and 
essential 
value 
added 
of 
providing policy 
advice and 
implementation 
support 
for 
decentralization 
in 
a 
comprehensive manner, 
across 
sectors 
and throughout 
the 
country.  There 
is 
a 
growing 
momentum 
for 
other donors 
to 
“buy 
into” 
the 
LGDP 
“model”  supported 
by 
the 
Bank. 
This 
has the 
potential 
to 
consolidate support, 
within 
Government 
and 
across donors, 
for 
the 
intergovernmental 
relations 
that 
are 
evolving 
under 
the 
Government’s 
decentralization 
policy. 
This 
consolidation 
of 
support 
is 
the 
chief 
value 
added 
by 
the Bank, 
to 
be 
achieved 
under 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
11, 
and 
potentially 
under 
a decentralization 
in 
PRSC.

As 
designed, 
LGDP 
I1 
involves further 
testing 
and 
replicating 
a 
system 
of 
participatory, 
demand-driven 
investment allocation, planning, 
implementation 
and 
improved 
service 
delivery 
in 
the context 
of 
decentralization.  However, 
since 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
LGDP 
I1 
investments 
required 
under 
the 
project 
cannot 
be 
determined a 
priori, 
the 
justification 
of 
LGDP 
rests 
on 
demonstrating the 
following 
two 
hypotheses: 
(i) 
that the 
LGDP 
processes 
that 
are 
in 
place 
are 
functional and 
sustainable; 
and, 
(ii) 
that the 
priority 
investments 
identified, 
selected 
and 
implemented 
following 
LGDP 
processes 
do 
achieve the 
desired 
outputhmpact. 
The 
first 
hypothesis 
was tested 
during 
the 
MTR. 
The 
result 
confirmed 
that 
the 
LGDP 
processes 
are 
functional and 
that 
sustainability 
may 
require 
taking 
further 
local 
government 
revenue 
enhancement 
measures. 
The 
second hypothesis 
is 
being 
validated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
data generated 
by 
tranches 
I 
and 
I1 
under 
LGDP 
I. 
A 
total 
of 
1,896 
subprojects 
under 
tranche 
I 
and 
2,849 
subprojects 
under 
tranche 
I1 
covering 
several sectors were 
financed 
on 
the basis 
the 
LGDP 
framework 
at 
a 
total 
cost 
of 
Ush. 
10.6 
billion 
and 
Ush.18.8 
billion 
respectively. 
The 
quality 
of 
the 
implementation 
results 
was 
assessed 
as 
satisfactory 
at 86% 
and 
88% 
levels respectively. 
Assessment 
of 
the 
viability 
of 
the 
program 
was based 
on 
tranche 
I 
and 
I1 
data 
of 
LGDP 
I 
using 
various 
evaluation 
approaches. 
The 
analyses 
undertaken 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project 
appraisal 
indicate 
that 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
I1 
investment 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
viable. 
The feasibility 
measures 
indicate 
that the Project: 
(i) 
is 
cost-effective; 
(ii) 
has 
high 
economic 
rate 
of 
return; 
and 
(iii) 
high 
benefit-cost 
ratios and 
associated 
social 
and 
economic 
benefits. 
In 
the 
aggregate, 
the 
results 
of 
the 
analyses 
confirm 
that 
LGDP 
investment 
framework 
would 
most 
likely 
lead 
to 
selecting 
and 
financing 
viable social 
and 
economic 
priority 
investment 
interventions 
by 
local 
governments. 
Overall, 
the 
LGDP 
framework 
is 
indeed functional and provides 
a 
fairly 
sound 
process 
for 
effective 
prioritizing 
and 
resource 
allocation 
of 
the 
Local 
Development Grant 
of 
LGDP 
11. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$

FRR

(see 
Annex 
4) 
capacity 
to 
generate 
revenues 
and 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
absorption 
capacity. 
The 
resource envelope 
defined 
for 
the 
program 
appears 
to 
be realistic 
both 
when 
looking 
at 
the 
Fiscal Impact: 
Overall, the 
fiscal impact 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
relatively small 
to 
the Government budget 
but 
its 
potential 
benefit 
is 
high. 
Annually, 
LGDP 
II 
disbursements 
represent about 
4% 
of 
the 
Central 
Government current 
-13- 
Page  18
revenue 
and 
even 
a smaller 
part 
of 
its 
total 
expenditure. 
Moreover, 
while 
the expected 
impact 
on 
the 
ground 
in 
terms 
of 
capacity 
building 
and 
poverty 
alleviation 
is 
deemed 
significant, 
the 
overall 
size 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
investment 
relative 
to GDP 
is 
only 
about 
0.5%. 
At 
the 
central 
level, 
the 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
LGDP 
II 
is 
consistent 
with 
Government’s 
Medium 
Term 
Expenditure Framework 
and 
does 
not 
exceed 
the 
budget 
ceilings allocated 
for 
fiscal 
flows 
to local 
authorities 
and other 
permitted 
expenditures 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project. 
At 
local 
level, 
the 
key 
fiscal 
issues 
concern the 
ability 
of 
local 
authorities 
to 
fund 
the 
increased 
operational and 
maintenance expenditures 
that 
an 
increased 
stock 
of 
physical infrastructure 
(funded 
from 
the 
LGDP) 
entails 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
various 
sector 
ministries 
to 
finance 
the recurrent 
costs 
associated 
with 
teachers 
and 
nurses 
salaries, etc. 
This 
is 
dealt 
with 
under 
“Sustainability” 
below. 
3. 
Technical: 
The choice 
of 
technology 
will 
be govemed 
by 
existing 
national technical 
standards 
and 
would 
be 
arrived 
at 
through 
an 
iterative community participatory 
approach 
based 
on 
the 
level 
of 
the 
available budget 
envelope, the 
ability 
of 
the beneficiaries 
to 
meet 
the 
cohnding 
requirements 
and 
the 
Operation 
and 
Maintenance 
(O&M) 
costs. 
Local 
contracting 
industry 
capacity 
has 
been 
built 
to 
a 
limited 
extent 
over 
the 
last 
three 
years 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
I, 
and 
capacity 
has 
been 
improving 
steadily. 
Tendering 
and contracts management 
capacity 
of 
the 
technical 
departments 
of 
the 
LGs 
has also 
been 
built 
gradually and 
has 
been 
improving 
over 
the 
implementation 
period 
of 
LDGP 
I. 
Thus, 
there 
is 
a 
fairly 
sound 
base 
for 
continuous 
enhancement 
of 
these 
capacities 
during 
the 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
11. 
4. 
Institutional: 
The 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
project implementation 
will 
be 
as 
per 
the 
government structure. 
At 
the 
central 
level, 
the 
MoLG, 
MoFPED, 
and 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General 
shall 
be responsible 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
the 
project, ensuring that 
the 
project 
resources 
are 
budgeted 
for 
and 
disbursed 
within 
the 
national 
MTEF, 
and the 
project 
accounts 
audited 
as 
per 
the 
Development Financing 
Agreement 
(DFA) 
and 
GoU 
requirements 
respectively. 
At 
the 
LG 
level, 
the 
Districts 
and 
Municipal 
LGs 
together 
with 
their 
respective 
lower 
LGs 
shall 
be 
responsible 
for 
meeting 
the 
access 
requirements and 
utilizing 
the 
grants 
as 
per 
their 
work 
plans and 
budgets. 
Management 
of 
the 
completed facilities, 
including 
operations 
and 
maintenance, 
will 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
ownersbeneficiaries 
or 
wherever 
the 
recurrent 
cost 
implication 
lies. 
O&M 
responsibilities 
have been 
detailed 
in 
the 
Operational 
Manual 
for 
the 
Local 
Government Grant 
(Annex 
1 
to 
the 
Project Implementation 
Plan). 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Local 
Government 
will 
be 
the 
executing 
ministry 
for 
LGDP 
I1 
and 
will 
also 
be 
directly 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
Components 
1,4 
& 
5. 
4.2 
Project 
management: 
MoLG 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
executing and coordinating 
the 
activities 
for 
the 
project. 
A 
Program 
Coordination 
Unit 
(PCLJ) 
(currently 
the 
PMU) 
will 
support 
the 
MoLG 
in 
the management 
and 
coordination 
of 
the various 
Project activities. 
In 
line 
with 
the proposed mainstreaming 
of 
the 
LGDP 
I 
PMU, 
existing 
programs 
being 
executed 
by 
PMU 
shall 
be 
gradually 
mainstreamed 
into 
the 
MoLG, 
in 
a 
phased manner, 
beginning 
with 
those 
activities 
which 
are 
routine 
in 
nature. 
During 
this 
mainstreaming 
transition 
period, 
the 
PCU 
will 
provide 
only 
the 
necessary 
technical backup 
support, 
and 
will 
primarily 
concentrate 
on 
ensuring 
that 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
implemented 
as 
per 
IDNGoU 
protocol 
agreement. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
PCU 
will 
gradually 
change 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Project 
with 
tasks 
gradually 
being 
integrated 
into 
the 
mainstream 
activities 
of 
the 
MoLG. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
PCU 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
kept 
at 
the 
present 
level 
over 
the 
project 
time-frame, 
but 
the 
role 
of 
the 
staff 
will 
gradually 
change 
from 
project implementation 
to 
consultancy 
and 
technical 
support 
to 
the 
MoLG 
(although 
the 
core 
Project 
management 
functions, 
like 
- 
14- 
Page  19
financial 
management 
will 
be 
kept 
within 
the 
PCU). 
The 
PCU 
will 
prepare 
work 
plans, budgets, 
reports 
and other 
documents, 
will 
maintain liaison 
with 
all 
component task 
managers, 
will 
disburse 
funds 
and 
review 
fund 
accountability, 
organize 
and 
oversee 
quarterly 
review 
meetings, 
procure 
equipment 
and 
services, 
monitor 
and evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
activities 
and 
the 
Project 
WIs, 
contracting 
and 
supervision 
of 
consultancy 
assignments 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
reports 
detailing 
consultancy 
findings. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
Procurement 
under 
the 
Project shall be 
guided 
by 
the 
IDA 
procurement 
guidelines 
(at 
National 
level) and 
at 
the 
LGs 
level, 
by 
the 
Draft 
Local 
Governments 
(Tender) Regulations, 
2001 
(under sub-section 
(1) 
of 
section 
176 
of 
the 
Local 
Governments Act, 
1997. 
Procurement 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
using 
MoLG 
structures 
created 
under 
the 
new 
procurement 
law. The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
day 
to 
day procurement 
activities carried 
out 
by 
the Procurement 
Specialist 
availed 
by 
the 
ministry 
specifically 
to 
deal 
with 
procurement 
activities related 
to 
this 
project. 
At 
the 
LG 
level, the 
existing 
structures 
will 
be 
used 
in 
a 
similar 
manner 
with 
the 
Tender 
Board 
Secretaries 
(TBS) responsible 
for 
quality 
assurance 
of 
all 
procurement documents 
prior to 
presentation to 
their 
Tender 
Boards 
for 
approval 
or 
contract 
award. 
MoLG 
will 
also 
monitor 
the 
procurement 
activities 
at 
the 
LG 
level 
where 
the 
capacity 
will 
be 
systematically 
built 
and 
reviewed 
over 
the 
life 
of 
LGDP 
11. 
The Project Implementation 
Plan 
(PIP) 
has 
been 
prepared 
which 
outlines 
the 
procurement 
procedures 
including 
standard 
forms 
to 
be 
used 
under 
the 
project. 
The 
PIP 
is 
a 
living 
document that 
will 
be 
updated 
as 
new 
developments 
in 
the 
procurement 
reforms 
under 
the 
new 
Public 
Procurement and Disposal 
of 
Public 
Assets 
Authority 
(PPDPAA) 
will 
be 
incorporated 
subject 
to 
agreement 
between 
GoU 
and 
IDA. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The 
Country Financial 
Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
carried 
out 
by 
IDA 
in 
2001 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
GoU 
indicated 
that 
inadequate 
financial 
accounting and 
auditing 
systems 
and 
capacities 
both 
at 
the center and 
in 
the 
LGs 
pose 
a 
major fiduciary 
risk. 
Some 
of 
the 
reforms aimed 
at 
addressing 
existing 
weaknesses 
have 
yielded positive 
improvements 
in 
the 
accountability 
environment 
in 
the 
public 
sector, 
and 
will 
further 
be 
partly 
supported 
by 
the 
LGDP 
11. 
A 
CFAA 
update 
is 
planned 
for 
FY04. 
The 
key 
objective 
of 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management 
system 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
funds 
are 
used 
only 
for 
their 
intended 
purposes 
in 
an 
efficient 
and 
economical way. 
The 
key 
risks 
that 
the 
project may 
face 
relate to 
staffing 
and 
LG 
capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
control 
procedures (accounting, 
intemal 
audit 
and 
inspection), 
funds 
flow 
delays 
and 
inadequate 
levels 
of 
counterpart 
funding, 
inadequacy 
of 
mechanisms 
used 
to identify community 
needs, 
and 
lack 
of 
audit 
capacity. 
To 
mitigate 
the 
above 
risks, 
MoLG 
will 
establish 
a 
strong 
intemal 
control 
system 
and 
ensure 
that 
the 
PCU 
is 
always 
staffed 
with 
appropriately 
qualified 
staff. 
A 
financial 
performance 
assessment 
will 
be carried out annually 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with all 
accountability 
rules 
and 
procedures 
as 
a 
precondition 
for 
access 
to 
development 
grants 
by 
LGs. 
Project 
funds 
will 
also 
be 
disbursed 
in 
accordance 
with 
an 
agreed schedule 
to 
which 
the 
GoU 
will 
be 
committed. 
The 
disbursement 
of 
the 
IDA 
Credit 
to 
the 
project 
for 
components 
1,4 
and 
5 
will 
be 
done 
quarterly 
based 
on 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports 
(FMRs). 
Funds 
for 
components 
2 and 3 
will 
be 
disbursed 
to 
the 
Special 
Account. 
From 
there, 
the 
IDA 
funds 
in 
conjunction 
with 
those 
from 
other 
donors 
will 
be 
disbursed 
in 
quarterly 
releases 
into 
the 
Consolidated 
Fund 
(CF). 
From 
there, 
funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
to 
the 
LGs 
for 
investments subprojects consistent 
with 
Schedule 
11, 
Part 2 
of 
the 
Local 
Govemments 
Act 
of 
1997 
and 
using 
LGDP 
modalities. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
counterpart 
funds 
for 
components 
1,4 
& 
5, 
it 
is 
proposed that 
MoLG, 
will 
apply 
to 
the 
Poverty 
Eradication 
Working 
Group 
to 
consider the 
activities 
under 
the 
above 
components 
under 
PAF. 
MoLG 
will 
carry 
out 
a 
Financial 
Performance 
Assessment 
(FPA) 
in 
AugustiSeptember each 
year. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
this 
will 
determine 
access 
by 
LGs 
to 
development 
grants. 
For 
components 
2 
and 
3, 
consolidated 
quarterly 
financial 
reports 
will 
be 
prepared 
by 
each 
HLG. 
- 
15- 
Page  20
The 
submission 
of 
these 
reports 
to 
the 
MOLG 
will 
be 
a prerequisite 
for 
the 
release 
of 
quarterly 
disbursements 
to 
the 
LGs. 
The 
staffing 
department 
of 
the 
PMU 
is 
made 
up 
of 
the 
Program Accountant, and 
an 
Assistant 
Program 
Accountant 
and an 
Accounts 
Assistant. 
The 
accounting 
systems, 
policies 
and 
procedures 
employed 
by 
the 
PMU 
in 
accounting and managing 
for 
LGDP 
funds 
are 
documented 
in 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Manual 
(FMM) 
for 
the 
project. 
The 
PMU 
has 
completed the 
installation 
of 
the 
accounting 
system, 
based 
on 
Sunsystems 
software, 
and 
staff 
were 
fully 
trained 
in 
its 
operation. 
The 
FMM 
will 
be 
updated 
to 
include 
detailed descriptions 
of 
the accounting 
system 
and 
procedures. 
The 
Project 
Chart 
of 
Accounts 
will 
be 
amended 
to 
allow 
for 
project 
costs 
to 
be 
directly 
related 
to 
specific 
work 
activities 
and outputs 
of 
the 
project 
and 
formats 
of 
the various 
periodic financial 
reports. 
MoFPED 
(Treasury 
Department) 
will 
be 
responsible for 
conducting 
the 
internal 
audit 
function 
for 
the 
project. 
This 
will 
be 
strengthened 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
Government Financial 
Regulations and 
through 
the 
allocation 
of 
more 
staff 
resources. 
The 
Auditor 
General 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
external 
audit 
of 
the 
project 
and the 
relevant 
local 
government 
accounts. 
The 
audited 
financial 
statements 
together 
with 
the 
auditor’s 
report 
and 
the 
auditor’s management 
letter 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
within 
six months 
after end 
of 
each 
financial 
year. 
Actions 
outlined 
in 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Action 
Plan 
will 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
project 
to 
strengthen 
the 
financial 
management 
system. 
The 
actions consist 
of 
updating 
the 
FMM, 
finalization 
of 
internal audit 
arrangements, 
completion 
of 
the 
audit 
approach 
for 
the 
audit 
of 
lower local 
government 
financial 
statements, 
updating 
of 
the 
Project 
Chart 
of 
Accounts, 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
Terms 
of 
Reference 
for 
the 
external audit 
for 
the 
project financial 
statements. 
The 
Government 
will 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
staffing 
arrangements 
are 
maintained throughout 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project. 
The conclusion 
of 
the 
assessment 
is 
that the 
financial 
management arrangements 
for 
the 
project 
satisfy 
the 
Bank’s 
minimum 
requirements under 
OP/BP 
10.02 
and 
are 
adequate 
to 
provide, 
with 
reasonable 
assurance, 
accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
on 
the 
status 
of 
the 
project required 
by 
IDA. 
Satisfactory 
steps 
have also been 
taken 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
arising 
from 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
local 
government 
financial 
management arrangements 
and 
these 
continue 
to 
yield 
satisfactory improvements 
in 
the 
local 
government 
accountability 
environment. 
Actions intended 
to 
further 
strengthen 
the 
project’s 
financial 
management 
system 
are 
outlined 
in 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Action 
Plan 
above.

Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation 
and disclosure) 
and 
the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The 
GOU’s 
National 
Environment 
Statute 
of 
1995 
and the Bank‘s 
Operational Policies 
4.01 
requires 
the 
preparation 
of 
an 
Environmental 
Assessment 
and 
Social Management 
Framework 
(ESMF) 
which 
establishes 
a mechanism 
to 
determine and 
assess 
future 
potential 
environmental 
and social impacts 
of 
Local 
Government subproject investments 
under 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
11. 
The 
ESMF 
establishes 
the 
screening process 
or 
mechanism 
for 
the 
subprojects 
to 
enable 
the 
LGs 
to 
identify 
potential 
environmental 
and social impacts 
of 
subprojects 
and 
to 
address 
them 
by 
incorporating 
the relevant 
mitigation 
measures 
into 
the 
designs 
of 
the 
subprojects. 
It 
also 
assesses 
the 
capacity at 
the 
District 
and 
Lower 
Local 
Governments 
to 
implement 
the 
proposed 
screening process 
and 
mitigation 
measures, 
including 
the 
provision 
of 
support 
to 
communities 
in 
cases 
of 
community 
managed subprojects, 
and 
make 
recommendations 
as 
appropriate, 
including 
training 
needs 
and 
costs. 
The 
ESMF 
indicates 
the 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
the 
environmental and social 
management 
of 
future 
subprojects, 
including 
monitoring 
indicators and a 
costed 
monitoring 
plan. 
The 
ESMF 
also 
assesses 
the 
content, 
use 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
existing Environmental 
and Social 
Checklist 
prepared under 
LGDP 
I 
and 
PRSC2.

The 
investments 
under 
Component 
2 
fall 
under 
various 
sectors 
such 
as 
water 
supply, 
drainage, sanitation, 
solid 
waste 
management, 
access 
roads, 
construction 
of 
schools 
and 
health facilities. 
In 
addition, the 
investments 
are 
sectorally 
varied 
given 
that 
they 
are 
determined 
by 
local-level 
priorities 
which 
will 
differ 
from 
one 
local 
government 
to 
another. 
Due 
to 
the 
diverse nature 
of 
the 
investments, the 
scope 
of 
the 
environmental 
analysis 
for 
each 
investment 
would 
also vary. 
The 
investments 
financed 
by 
LGDP 
I 
by 
sector have 
been 
education 
(30%), 
roads 
(25%), 
health 
(lo%), 
sanitatioddrainage 
(10%) 
and water 
(14%). 
The 
ESMF 
presents 
definitive, 
conclusive and clear 
procedures consistent 
with 
the 
Laws 
in 
Uganda 
and the 
World 
Bank 
Safeguard 
Policies. 
The 
ESMF 
report 
was 
disclosed 
to 
the 
public 
on 
March 
26,2003 
by 
the 
Government 
of 
Uganda and 
the 
World 
Bank. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
The 
Environmental 
Mitigation 
Plan 
(EMP) 
which 
is 
prepared 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Environmental 
and 
Social 
Impact 
Assessment 
(ESIA) 
would 
consist 
of 
a 
set 
of 
mitigation 
measures, 
monitoring 
and 
institutional 
measures 
to 
be 
taken 
during 
implementation 
and operation 
of 
the subprojects 
to 
eliminate 
adverse 
environmental 
and social 
impacts, 
offset 
them 
or 
reduce 
them 
to 
acceptable 
levels. 
The 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
are: 
(i) 
mitigation 
plan 
which would 
describe 
the technical details 
of 
each 
mitigation 
measure, 
together 
with 
designs, 
equipment 
descriptions and 
operation 
procedures 
as 
appropriate; 
and 
(ii) 
monitoring 
objectives that 
would 
specify 
the type 
of 
monitoring 
activities 
that 
will 
be 
linked 
to 
the 
mitigation 
measures. 
The 
EMP 
would 
also 
provide 
specific description 
of 
institutional 
arrangements. 
In 
addition, 
the 
EMP 
would 
include an 
estimate 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
measures 
and 
activities 
recommended 
so 
that 
the 
LGs 
can 
budget 
the 
necessary 
funds. 
The 
mitigation 
and 
monitoring 
measures 
recommended 
in 
the 
EMP 
would 
be 
developed 
in 
consultation 
with 
all 
affected 
groups 
to 
include their 
concerns 
and 
views 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
EMP. 
5.3 
For 
Category

and

projects, 
timeline 
and 
status 
of 
EA: 
Date 
of 
receipt 
of 
final 
draft: 
March 
6, 
2003 
The project 
has 
a 
category 
B 
rating. 
The 
investments 
under 
this 
project 
will 
focus 
on 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
delivery 
of 
basic services and 
will 
result 
in 
improved 
living 
conditions. 
The 
investments 
under 
the 
project 
would 
be sectorally 
varied 
given 
that they 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
local 
level 
priorities 
which 
will 
differ 
from 
one 
local 
government 
to 
another. 
The 
types 
of 
investment 
are 
comnion community 
development 
projects 
whose 
potential environmental and 
social effects 
are 
well 
understood, 
unlikely 
to 
be 
significant,  and 
readily 
manageable. 
Modular 
sector 
specific environmental checklists 
have 
been 
prepared 
for 
projects and 
these 
checklists 
will 
be 
used 
to 
determine 
that the investments 
conform 
to 
environmentally 
appropriate guidelines and 
that 
they 
incorporate 
the 
mitigation 
measures 
defined 
therein. 
Local 
Governments 
will 
be 
required 
to 
apply 
the 
environmental 
checklists 
for 
appraising 
their 
investments and 
comply 
with 
the 
mitigation 
measures 
contained 
therein. 
In 
addition, 
routine 
checks 
will 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
that 
individual 
investments 
also 
conform to nationally 
applicable 
environmental 
standards. 
All 
of 
these measures are 
contained 
in 
the 
ESMF 
prepared 
for 
the 
project. 
The 
environmental 
checklist 
prepared 
under 
LGDP 
I 
will 
be 
revised 
and 
upgraded 
so 
that 
it 
conforms 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
ESMF 
and the Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF). 
Under 
the 
project, 
an environmental and 
resettlement 
training 
module 
will 
be 
developed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
standardized 
training module 
for 
LGs. 
The 
project 
does 
not 
intend 
to 
displace 
any 
settler 
within 
the 
project location. Project 
design, 
determination 
of 
investment 
sites 
and 
implementation 
arrangements 
are 
all 
to 
be 
formulated through 
a 
participatory 
process. 
Availability 
of 
land without 
any 
form 
of 
encumbrances 
is 
one 
of 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
project 
site 
selection 
and 
implementation. 
An 
RPF 
has 
been prepared 
and Resettlement Plans subsequently 
developed 
and presented 
for 
approval 
if 
land 
taking 
is 
necessary. 
The 
RPF 
establishes 
the 
resettlement 
and 
compensation 
principles, 
organizational 
arrangements 
and design 
criteria 
to 
be 
applied 
to 
meet the 
needs 
of 
the people 
who may 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
project

5.4 
How 
have stakeholders 
been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental screening 
and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental impacts and proposed environment 
management 
plan?  Describe 
mechanisms 
of 
consultation that were 
used 
and 
which 
groups were consulted? 
Environmental 
screening 
of 
subprojects 
would 
be 
carried 
by 
the 
LGs 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
their 
Technical Planning 
Committees 
(TPCs), 
Investment Committees 
(ICs), 
Project 
Management Committees 
(PMCs), 
and 
District 
Technical 
Departments 
(DPTs) 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
carry out 
the 
appropriate 
ESIA 
when 
needed 
for 
each 
subproject. 
Before 
approving 
a 
subproject, the 
TPC verifies 
that 
the 
subprojects 
meet 
the 
environmental and social requirements 
of 
the 
national 
and 
local 
governments and 
consistent 
with 
the 
overall 
LGDP 
I1 
ESMF 
and other applicable environmental and 
social 
policies 
and 
safeguards 
of 
the 
World 
Bank. 
They 
must 
also ensure 
that 
any 
legally 
required 
ESIA 
report 
has 
been 
prepared and 
approved 
by 
the 
Local 
Government 
Council 
before 
the 
subproject 
is 
approved 
for 
funding. 
Public 
consultations 
will 
be 
held 
with 
the 
local 
communities and 
all 
other 
interested 
/affected 
parties. 
These 
consultations 
will 
identify key 
issues 
and 
determine 
how 
the 
concerns 
of 
all 
parties 
will 
be 
addressed 
in 
the 
terms 
of 
reference 
of 
the 
ESIA. 
To 
facilitate meaningful 
consultations, 
the 
LGs 
through 
the 
PMCs, 
would 
provide 
all 
relevant 
material 
and 
information 
concerning 
the 
subprojects 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
prior 
to 
the 
consultation, 
in 
a 
form 
and 
language 
that 
are 
understandable 
and 
accessible 
to 
the 
groups 
being 
consulted. 
Depending 
on 
the 
public 
interest 
in 
the 
potential 
impacts 
of 
the 
subprojects, 
a 
public 
hearing 
may 
be 
requested 
to better convey 
concerns. 
To 
ensure 
that 
an appropriate 
public 
consultation 
mechanism 
is 
developed, the TPC’s 
should 
ensure 
that 
the 
ESIA 
terms 
of 
reference 
include 
such 
a 
requirement. Once 
the 
ESIA 
has 
been 
reviewed 
and cleared 
by 
the TPC’s 
and 
local 
government councils, 
the 
PMC’s 
will 
inform 
the 
public 
about 
the 
results 
of 
the 
ESIA. 
This 
approach 
would 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
OP 4.01 
Environmental 
Assessment 
as 
well 
as 
Uganda’s 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
its 
public 
consultation 
process. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have been established 
to 
monitor 
and evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
Modular 
sector 
specific environmental checklists 
have 
been 
prepared 
for 
the 
project 
and 
these 
checklists 
will 
be 
used 
to 
determine 
that 
the 
investments 
conform 
to 
environmentally 
appropriate 
guidelines 
and 
that 
they 
incorporate the 
mitigation 
measures 
defined 
therein. 
For 
LGDP 
I, 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
guidelines 
for 
the sub-projects were 
developed 
to 
monitor 
performance 
and 
process.  These 
guidelines 
suggested 
what 
should be 
monitored, 
indicators 
of 
achievement 
of 
improvements, 
means 
of 
verifying 
the 
improvements, 
frequency 
of 
monitoring, methodology 
or 
how 
the 
monitoring 
will 
be 
done, 
and 
finally 
who 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
monitoring. 
Additionally, 
for 
LGDP 
11, 
these 
guidelines 
will 
be revised 
to 
provide 
clear 
and 
functional environmentalhocial 
issues 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
roles 
and 
responsibilities, 
and 
to 
provide 
monitoring 
indicators 
in 
order 
to 
measure 
the 
success 
of 
the 
mitigation 
measures, 
cumulative impacts 
from 
implementation 
of 
multiple 
sub 
projects,  compliances 
with 
approval 
processes 
and conditions, 
and 
identifying 
further 
ESMF 
process-strengthening 
and capacity 
building 
needs. 
Local 
Governments 
will 
be 
required 
to 
apply 
the environmental checklists 
for 
appraising 
their 
investments and 
comply 
with 
the 
mitigation 
measures 
contained 
therein. 
To 
determine 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
ESIA 
required, 
potential 
impacts 
in 
the 
following 
areas 
need 
to 
be 
considered: 
(i) 
social 
issues; 
(ii) 
health 
issues; 
(iii) 
protected 
areas; 
(iv) 
cultural 
heritage, 
archaeological 
sites; 
(v) 
existing natural 
resources such 
as 
forests, soils, wetlands, 
water 
resources; 
and 
(vi) 
wildlife 
or 
endangered species’ habitats. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
RPF, 
an 
individual 
Resettlement 
Plan 
(RP) 
will 
be 
prepared 
during 
project 
implementation 
for 
cases 
where 
land 
acquisition 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
necessary. 
Responsibilities 
for Monitoring 
and Evaluation 
of 
the 
Mitigation 
Measures 
would be 
assigned 
to 
the 
TPC, 
PMCs 
and 
the 
National 
Environment 
Authority 
(NEMA).

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and specify 
the 
project's social 
development 
outcomes. 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
is 
improved 
Local 
Government 
institutional 
performance 
for 
sustainable, 
decentralized 
service 
delivery. 
The 
key 
social 
issue 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
this 
is 
done 
in 
a 
socially 
and 
environmentally 
sustainable 
and 
gender 
sensitive 
manner. 
The 
project's planned social 
development 
outcomes 
of 
greater empowerment 
and social inclusion, 
are 
that the 
investments 
identified, 
prioritized 
and 
funded 
by 
LGs 
are 
environmentally 
sound 
and 
identified 
and 
monitored 
in 
a 
participatory, 
transparent 
and 
accountable manner 
through 
the 
utilization 
of 
the 
Harmonized 
Participatory Planning 
Guide 
(HPPG) 
for 
lower 
councils, 
a 
framework formulated 
and 
promoted 
by 
local 
governments 
and 
civil 
society 
in 
Uganda.  Gender concerns 
shall be 
addressed 
by 
ensuring that 
gender 
mainstreaming 
by 
LGs, 
in 
planning 
and 
budgeting, 
are 
included 
in 
the 
performance 
assessment 
criteria and 
an 
incentive 
mechanism 
is 
built 
into 
assessment 
process 
to 
reward good 
and sanction 
poor 
performers. 
Similarly, 
Local 
Governments 
working 
towards 
improved 
access 
to 
services 
that 
come 
out 
of 
the 
likely 
investments 
under 
LGDP 
I1 
by 
the 
often 
disadvantaged 
and 
marginalized 
groups 
of 
people 
like 
the 
disabled, the 
elderly, 
the 
women, 
orphans, etc. 
is 
paramount. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The 
GoU 
decentralization 
policy 
provides 
for 
a 
participatory 
approach 
to 
governance 
at the various 
levels 
of 
society. 
The 
primary 
beneficiaries 
of 
sustainable 
and decentralized 
service 
delivery 
resulting 
from 
improved 
LG 
institutional 
performance, the 
people 
of 
Uganda, 
will 
participate 
in 
identifying 
and 
prioritizing 
and 
monitoring 
investments 
in 
a 
participatory 
manner 
through 
the 
utilization 
of 
the 
HPPG. 
Indicators 
of 
participation 
at 
the 
various 
levels 
have 
been developed 
and 
built 
into 
the guide. 
During 
the 
reviews 
of 
LGDP 
I 
and 
the 
technical 
analysis 
for 
the design 
of 
the 
project, 
a 
participatory 
approach was 
used 
whereby 
all 
the 
key 
stakeholders 
(Line 
Ministries, 
donors, 
Civil 
Society 
Organizations, 
LGs, 
etc) 
were 
consulted 
and 
a number 
of 
feedback workshops 
organized 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
provide 
their 
inputs 
and 
validate 
the 
conclusions 
and recommendations 
of 
the 
review 
reports 
and 
technical 
studies. 
As 
a 
result, 
Non 
Governmental Organizations 
(NGOs), 
CBOs 
and private 
sector service 
providers 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
LGs 
capacity 
building 
plans 
as 
per 
guidelines 
for 
minimum 
conditions 
assessment. 
The 
timing 
of, feedback 
on 
and 
team 
composition 
of 
the 
annual 
assessment 
have 
been 
influenced 
to 
include 
civil 
society 
and 
donor 
input 
and representation. 
Similarly, 
a number 
of 
bilateral 
donors 
have expressed 
interest 
to 
co-fund 
LGDP 
11. 
Efforts 
to 
provide 
for 
incentives 
or 
mechanisms 
for improving 
support 
and 
participation 
for 
improved 
service 
delivery 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the' 
project 
,e.g. 
the transfer 
of 
unconditional 
grants 
that promote 
downward 
accountability, 
while 
rewarding 
well 
performing 
LGs. 
For 
continued participation, 
the 
participatory 
approach 
adopted 
during 
the 
Project 
design 
shall 
continue 
during 
the 
implementation 
phase 
through 
meetings, 
consultative 
and 
feedback 
workshops 
that 
will 
support 
the 
critical 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
including 
the 
transfer 
of 
control 
of 
some 
decisions 
and 
resources 
like 
the 
Local 
Development and 
Local 
Capacity 
Building 
Grant. 
The 
same 
policy 
requires 
LGs, 
through 
a 
participatory 
manner, 
to 
prepare three-year 
rolling 
development plans 
incorporating 
the 
plans 
of 
lower 
LGs. 
This 
legal 
provision 
has 
been strengthened 
under 
the 
project 
by 
making 
it 
a 
minimum 
access 
criterion 
for 
LGs. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
Civil 
Society Organizations 
(CSOs) 
including 
NGOs, 
both 
international 
and indigenous 
have 
actively 
participated 
in 
the 
district 
reviews 
of 
LGDP 
I, 
stakeholders meetings, workshops, 
and 
the 
technical 
analysis 
for 
the 
design 
of 
the 
project 
and 
this 
collaboration 
will 
continue 
during 
implementation, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation. 
Civil 
society organizations have comparative 
advantages 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
advocacy, 
community mobilization 
and training. One 
key 
area 
where 
CSOs 
have 
been 
very 
active 
is 
in 
-19- 
Page  24
the 
revision 
of 
investment 
planning 
guides 
to 
make 
them 
more 
participatory. 
Partnerships 
between 
LGs 
and 
CSOs 
including NGOs 
in 
the 
implementation and 
monitoring 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
greatly 
encouraged. 
It 
is, 
therefore, the 
intention 
that 
the 
current 
policy 
where 
LGs 
are 
not 
encouraged 
to 
use 
force 
accounts 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
services 
shall 
be 
applied 
and 
enforced 
under 
the 
Project. 
This 
would allow 
LGs 
to 
contract 
NGOs/CSOs, 
through 
a 
competitive 
process, 
to 
provide 
services 
for 
which 
they 
have 
the 
comparative 
advantages. 
Those NGOs/CSOs, 
which 
have 
their 
own 
resources, 
shall 
be 
encouraged 
to 
complement the 
efforts 
of 
the 
project. 
6.4 
What 
institutional 
arrangements have 
been 
provided to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes? 
The 
MoLG 
has 
developed a 
gender 
mainstreaming 
strategy 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Gender, 
Labor, and 
Social 
Development 
(MoGLSD) 
and other 
stakeholders. 
The 
MoLG 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
commissioning 
a consultant 
to 
develop 
gender 
proxy 
indicators arising 
out 
of 
the 
strategy. These 
indicators 
shall be 
used 
for 
assessing 
LGs 
compliance 
to 
gender 
mainstreaming requirements. Plans 
are 
underway, 
with 
financial 
support 
from 
the 
United 
Nations 
Capital 
Development 
Fund 
(UNCDF), 
to 
conduct 
training 
of 
trainers 
(TOT) 
for 
LGs 
on 
gender 
mainstreaming 
strategy. 
The 
MoGLSD 
in 
collaboration 
with 
MoLG 
shall 
be 
the 
institutions 
to 
ensure 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the strategy. 
In 
addition, 
the 
MoLG 
with 
LGs 
and 
CSOs 
input 
has 
prepared 
and 
issued 
to 
all 
LGs, 
in 
March 
2002, 
a 
draft Harmonized Participatory Planning Guideline 
(HPPG) 
for 
field-testing. 
The 
draft 
HPPG 
introduces 
innovative 
approaches 
as 
to 
how 
LGs 
should 
address 
issues 
such 
as 
gender, 
environment, 
poverty, and 
livelihood 
analysis, 
etc 
(as 
opposed 
to problem 
based 
planning) 
while 
preparing 
their 
three-year 
development plans. 
In 
addition, 
the 
manual 
provides 
for 
participatory 
performance 
monitoring 
that 
will 
help 
in 
mapping out 
changes 
in 
priority 
investments 
and 
hence 
responding 
to 
user 
preferences 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time promoting 
community 
empowerment. 
The 
draft manual 
has 
been 
circulated 
widely 
to 
stakeholders (donors, 
NGOs, 
CSOs, 
line 
ministries) 
for 
comments, 
and 
it 
is 
due 
for 
review 
in 
May/June 
2003 
after 
which 
it 
shall 
be 
published 
incorporating 
comments 
from 
stakeholders. 
The MoFPED, 
MoLG 
and 
the 
National 
Planning 
Authority 
(NPA) 
shall 
be 
the institutions 
for 
the 
developing 
of 
the 
planning 
guide.  Successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
above 
two 
guides, 
beginning 
FY2003/4 
(year 
1 
of 
LGDP 
11) 
would 
result 
into 
the 
Project achieving 
its 
social development 
outcomes 
of 
greater 
empowerment 
and 
social 
inclusion. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes? 
Under 
LGDP 
I, 
a Management 
Information 
System 
(MIS) 
was 
developed 
for monitoring 
and evaluating 
the social development 
outcomes 
of 
LGDP 
and 
also 
to 
provide 
the 
MoLG 
with 
a 
one-stop 
information 
center 
on 
LGs. 
This 
same 
MIS 
will 
be 
used 
for 
LGDP 
I1 
and 
National 
Service 
Delivery 
surveys 
that have 
a strong 
user 
satisfaction 
component 
to 
be 
done 
by 
Uganda Bureau 
of 
Statistics(UB0S) 
will 
employ 
both 
qualitative 
and 
quantitative 
approaches. 
Critical 
monitorable 
indicators include 
the 
following: 
0 
0 
% 
of 
LGs 
using 
the 
harmonized 
participatory 
planning 
guide 
for 
lower 
councils 
% 
of 
total 
expenditure 
by 
LGs 
for 
service 
provision 
contracted 
out 
to 
nongovernment entities 
% 
of 
LGs 
with 
institutionalized action 
plan 
on 
accountability 
and 
transparency 
including private 
sector 
0 
Training 
of 
LGs 
on 
how 
to 
use 
the 
system 
are 
to 
be 
conducted under 
the 
remaining 
period 
of 
LGDP 
I 
and 
during 
the 
life 
of 
LGDP 
11.

Describe 
provisions 
made 
by 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
applicable 
safeguard 
policies. 
A 
Resettlement 
Policy 
Framework 
(RPF) 
has 
been 
prepared 
under 
the 
project 
and 
was 
disclosed 
to 
the 
public on March 
26,2003, 
both 
in 
Uganda and 
at 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
RPF 
establishes 
the 
resettlement 
and 
compensation 
principles, 
organization 
arrangements 
and 
design 
criteria to 
be applied 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
people 
who may 
be affected 
by 
the 
project. 
The 
RPF 
is 
prepared 
to 
the 
standards 
of 
the 
Government's 
own 
policy 
on 
resettlement 
and 
compensation 
and 
the 
policy 
of 
the 
World 
Bank, 
OP 
4.12. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
RPF, 
an 
individual 
Resettlement 
Plan 
(RP) 
will 
be 
prepared 
during 
project 
implementation 
for 
cases 
where 
land 
acquisition 
turns 
out 
to 
be 
necessary. 
The 
RP 
will 
include 
measures 
to 
ensure 
that 
displaced 
persons 
are 
informed 
and 
consulted 
on 
their 
options 
and 
rights 
to 
resettlement 
and 
compensation 
and 
provided 
with 
prompt 
and 
effective 
compensation 
at 
full 
replacement 
cost 
for 
losses 
of 
assets 
and 
access, 
attributable 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
RPF 
will 
specify 
the 
format 
for 
reporting 
that 
the 
land 
given 
to 
the 
government 
as 
a 
"voluntary 
donation" 
by 
communities 
is 
in 
fact 
not 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
any 
villagers 
without 
the 
clout 
to 
decline 
to 
donate 
the land. 
The 
GoU 
has 
been 
very 
successful 
in 
carrying 
out 
the 
decentralization 
policy 
as 
all 
the 
local 
government 
institutions and 
structures 
are 
in 
place. 
The 
screening process 
will 
take advantage 
of 
this 
by 
assigning 
new 
responsibilities required 
in 
the 
RPF 
to 
the relevant 
local 
government 
planning 
bodies at the 
closest 
level 
to 
the 
affected 
communities. 
These 
planning 
bodies 
exist 
and 
are 
functional 
in 
Uganda.

An 
Environmental and Social 
Management 
Framework 
(ESMF) 
was 
prepared 
for 
the 
project 
and 
was 
disclosed 
to 
the 
public 
on 
March 
26,2003, 
both 
in 
Uganda and 
at 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
role 
and 
functions 
of 
the 
ESMF 
are 
described above 
in 
Section 
5.3. 
The 
ESMF 
and 
RPF 
will 
require 
individual 
subproject 
ESIAs 
and 
RPs 
in 
some 
cases. 
These 
will 
be 
disclosed 
to 
the 
public, 
prior to 
subproject 
approval, 
to 
meet 
relevant 
World 
Bank 
and 
Ugandan 
requirements. 
F. 
Sustainability and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
Sustainability 
issues 
for LGDP 
I1 
arise 
at 
two 
levels: 
(i) 
sustainability 
of 
the 
physical infrastructure 
investments made 
by 
local 
authorities 
with 
their 
receipts 
from 
the 
Local 
Development 
Grant 
(LDG), 
particularly 
if 
local 
revenues 
remain 
stagnant 
or 
decline; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
LGDP 
capital 
and 
capacity-building 
transfers 
as 
an ongoing 
element 
of 
the 
intergovernmental 
fiscal 
system 
in 
Uganda. 
The 
former 
issue was 
clearly identified 
during 
the 
mid-term 
review 
of 
LGDP 
I 
- 
where 
it 
was 
noted 
that 
-21 
- 
Page  26
the 
local 
revenue 
performance 
of 
many 
local 
authorities 
was 
deteriorating 
- 
and 
has 
remained 
a 
key 
source 
of 
concern 
for 
the 
Government 
of 
Uganda and 
donors since 
that time. 
LGDP 
I1 
seeks 
to 
address 
to 
address 
this 
issue 
in 
two 
ways. 
First, 
the 
assessment 
criteria 
(conditions) 
which local 
authorities 
will 
need 
to 
meet 
in 
order 
to 
access 
their 
LDG 
allocations 
will 
be 
tightened 
so 
as 
to 
sharpen 
incentives 
to 
improve 
local 
revenue performance. 
Second, 
Component 
4 
of 
the proposed 
project 
will 
support an 
extensive 
set 
of 
activities 
at 
policy, legal 
and 
operational 
levels 
to 
improve 
the 
own-source revenue 
performance 
of 
local 
authorities 
across 
the 
country. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
level 
(ii) 
issues, 
it 
is 
important 
that 
LGDP 
modality 
is 
retained 
as 
a 
fundamental 
feature 
of 
the intergovernmental transfer 
system 
in 
Uganda 
beyond 
the 
life 
of 
the project. 
Prospects 
for 
this 
are 
very 
good. 
In 
fact 
a 
cardinal 
feature 
of 
the government’s 
Fiscal Decentralization 
Strategy (approved 
by 
Cabinet 
in 
2002 
and 
currently 
under 
implementation) 
is 
that 
fiscal 
flows 
to

from 
both

the

by 
a

1.3 
Sector 
Issues 
Related to 
Decentralization. 
This 
component 
will 
supplement 
the 
FDS 
by 
identifying 
areas 
where sector 
policies, 
laws 
and practices 
are 
inconsistent 
andor 
not 
supportive 
to 
the 
overall framework 
of 
decentralization and propose solutions 
to 
these 
problems. 
Two 
activities 
will 
be 
carried under 
LGDP 
I1 
to 
support 
the 
resolution 
of 
cross sector 
issues: 
(i) 
review 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
LG 
administration 
and 
deconcentrated 
central government technical support 
units; 
and 
(ii) 
review 
of 
the 
LG 
legal framework 
(links 
between 
the 
LG 
Act 
and 
other 
related 
Acts) 
to 
identify 
contradictions 
and 
find 
solutions, 
e.g. 
the 
leadership 
code 
and the 
LG 
Act

1.4 
sub-component 
is 
to 
assist 
MoLG 
to coordinate capacity 
building 
for 
decentralization 
by 
formulating 
and 
implementing 
a 
National 
LG 
Capacity 
Building 
Strategy 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
relevant 
stakeholders. 
The 
Strategy 
should provide 
the 
framework 
for 
coordination 
of 
capacity 
building 
activities 
for 
a 
more 
demand 
driven 
process, 
whereby 
LGs 
themselves 
define 
training 
needs. 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
provide 
resources 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
(i) 
establishment 
of 
a 
LG 
Capacity 
Building 
Policy 
Committee, 
chaired 
by 
MoLG, 
being 
responsible 
for 
formulating 
a 
National 
LG 
Capacity 
Building 
Strategy; 
and 
(ii) 
to 
support 
for 
the 
running 
of 
a 
LG 
Capacity 
Building 
Unit 
within 
MoLG 
to 
serve 
as 
secretariat 
for 
the committee, and 
to 
implementing 
and 
following-up 
on 
the 
strategy. 
The 
unit 
will 
be 
augmented 
by 
technical 
working 
groups 
that 
will 
be 
formed 
to 
undertake 
specialize 
tasks. 
The 
working 
group 
will 
include 
key 
stakeholders 
and 
experts 
with 
the 
required 
expertise 
from 
government and 
non 
governmental organizations, 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
A 
technical 
working 
group 
on 
standardized 
training 
will 
be 
established 
prior 
to 
start 
of 
the 
Project 
and 
will 
include 
representatives 
from 
key 
relevant 
stakeholders, 
including 
line 
ministries. 
Strategic 
Framework 
- 
National 
Strategy 
and 
Institutional 
Set-up. 
The 
aim 
of 
this 
1.5 
Strengthen 
LG 
Human 
Resource 
Development Function. 
The 
aim 
of 
this 
sub-component 
is 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Human 
Resource 
Development 
Function 
of 
the 
district 
and 
municipal 
councils 
to 
plan 
for 
their 
own 
capacity 
development 
and 
training 
needs 
- 
and thereby 
support 
a 
demand 
driven 
approach 
to 
LG 
training. 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
provide 
resources 
for 
the 
development 
and 
piloting 
of 
a 
HRD 
course 
and 
introduction 
courses 
on 
the 
new 
manuals 
to 
build 
up 
‘district 
resource 
pools’ 
(trainers 
in 
LG). 
1.6 
Audit 
of 
the 
Accounts 
Lower Local 
Government 
(LC 
111s). 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
provide 
resources 
to 
carry 
out audits 
of 
the accounts 
of 
all 
the 
LC 
111s 
for 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the 
Project. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
Office 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General 
will 
institute 
a 
sustainable arrangements 
for 
the 
audit 
of 
LC 
111s. 
1.7 
Procurement Capacity 
Building 
at 
the 
HLG 
. 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
support 
the 
harmonization 
of 
procurement regulations and practices 
of 
the 
LGs 
with 
those 
of 
the 
CG. 
This 
is 
to 
be 
achieved 
by 
providing 
specialized 
training 
in 
procurement 
to 
create 
a core 
of 
four 
procurement 
proficient staff 
in 
each 
of 
the 
74 
HLGs 
and 
equip 
them 
to 
sensitize 
other 
staff 
and 
councilors 
who 
will 
be 
involved 
in 
- 
33 
- 
Page  38
procurement 
activities 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
program. 
Follow 
up 
will 
include further 
specialized 
training 
for 
this 
core 
staff 
and 
issues-based 
workshops 
as 
well 
as 
bi-annual 
independent 
procurement 
reviews. 
1.8 
Local 
Financial Management 
. 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
supplement the 
FDS 
and the 
Integrated 
Financial 
Management 
Systems 
(IFMS) 
by 
developing and 
implementing 
a 
strategy 
to 
improve financial 
management 
in 
those 
LGs 
which 
will 
not 
be 
covered 
by 
the 
IFMS 
in 
the 
short 
to 
medium 
term. 
The 
strategy 
will 
draw 
on 
the 
preliminary 
study 
conducted 
as 
part 
of 
the 
2002103 
PER. 
It 
will 
expand 
on 
the 
study 
and 
develop 
concrete 
and 
specific 
proposals 
for 
improving 
financial 
management 
in 
the 
identified 
LGs. 
Resources 
will 
also 
be 
made 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
strategy. 
Project 
Component 
2 
- 
US$107.50 
million 
2. 
Local 
Development 
Service 
Delivery 
The 
component comprises 
a 
non-sectoral 
conditional 
grant (termed the 
Local 
Development 
Grant, 
LDG), 
distributed 
on 
a 
formula 
basis 
between 
all 
local 
authorities 
in 
Uganda 
for 
investment 
in 
local 
infrastructure 
in 
accordance 
with 
local 
needs 
as 
these 
are 
determined 
through 
local 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
processes. 
Although 
all 
local 
authorities 
will 
be 
eligible 
to 
receive 
LDG 
funding, 
actual 
access 
to 
the 
grant 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
capacity, 
accountability, 
and 
performance 
conditionalities 
which 
are 
designed 
to 
incentivise 
improvements 
in 
sustainable service 
delivery 
at 
the 
local 
level. 
The 
LDG 
will 
thus 
be 
closely related 
to 
the 
local 
capacity 
building 
and 
revenue-enhancement 
activities 
which 
are 
supported 
through 
Components 
3 
and 
4 
of 
the 
grant 
The 
LDG 
within 
the 
grant 
will 
extend 
over 
a 
three 
year 
period 
- 
2003104,2004105 
and 
2005106 
- 
where 
after 
it 
is 
expected that 
will 
be 
funded 
from 
the 
GoU 
budget 
on 
a 
budget-support basis. 
All 
tiers 
of 
local 
government 
are 
eligible 
for 
accessing 
these resources, 
however, 
access 
to 
these 
funds 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
only 
those 
LGs 
which 
have 
met 
a 
set 
of 
minimum 
institutional, 
financial 
and 
operational 
requirements. 
The 
level 
of 
funding 
transferred 
to 
the 
LGs 
will 
increase 
gradually 
during 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Project along 
with 
a gradual 
swapping 
of 
sector 
grants 
and 
bilateral 
district 
support 
programs 
into 
LGDP 
modality. 
Design 
of 
the Component 
and 
Activities: 
2.1 
is 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
that 
(i) 
the 
aggregate 
annual amount 
should 
fall 
within 
the 
relevant 
Medium-Term 
Economic Framework 
(MTEF) 
ceiling, 
and 
(ii) 
individual local 
governments 
should 
receive a 
constant 
real 
per 
capita 
amount, 
taking 
the 
amounts 
received 
under 
LGDP 
I 
as 
a 
point 
of 
departure. 
Nominal 
allocations 
to 
local 
authorities 
will 
thus 
increase 
in 
line 
with 
inflation 
and 
population 
growth. 
In 
the 
long 
term, 
the 
per 
capita 
amount 
should 
also 
rise 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
assimilation 
of 
sector 
conditional 
grants 
within 
the 
LDG 
mechanism, 
but 
as 
it 
this 
is 
unlikely 
to 
occur over 
before 
FY 
05-06, 
increases 
of 
this 
land 
will 
not 
be 
a 
feature 
of 
LGDP 
11. 
Size 
of 
the 
LDG. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
LDG 
has 
been 
determined 
in 
accordance 
with 
sustainability 
and 
2.2 
maintained 
in 
LGDP 
11. 
This 
means 
that 
the 
urban 
authorities 
will 
receive a 
higher 
per 
capita 
LDG 
than 
the 
rural 
authorities, 
initially 
at 
the 
existing 
LDG 
level, 
indexed 
by 
the 
inflation 
rate 
- 
i.e. 
US$2.0 
per 
capita. 
The 
rural 
LGs 
start 
at 
1 
.O 
US$ 
from 
FY 
2003104. 
The 
town 
councils 
will 
be treated 
as 
urban 
authorities.

and 
simple 
formula 
for 
the 
horizontal

as 
these 
grants need 
to 
be 
managed 
holistically 
due 
to 
clear inter-linkages. 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
keep 
the existing allocation 
formula 
as 
per 
LGDP 
I 
for 
the 
first 
FY 
2003/04. 
The formula 
will 
then 
be 
adjusted 
to 
the decisions made 
by 
the 
GOU 
as 
part 
of 
the 
FDS 
review 
and 
reform 
work. 
The 
LGDP

Manual 
and 
the 
LGs 
are 
assessed 
on 
yearly 
basis 
in 
AugusUSeptember. 
The 
actual 
coverage 
of 
LGs 
will 
then 
depend 
on 
their 
compliance 
with 
the 
minimum 
conditions. 
Coverage and 
eligibility. 
LGDP 
11 
eligible 
LGs 
are 
all 
LGs 
in 
Uganda, 
which 
have 
complied 
to 
2.6 
Co-financing requirements. 
The 
reasons 
behind 
the co-funding 
requirement 
in 
LGDP 
I 
are 
well 
documented 
in 
the 
Mid-term 
Review 
of 
the 
LGDP 
I 
and 
other preparatory 
documents 
for 
the 
LGDP 
11. 
The 
level 
of 
LG 
co-funding 
requirements 
for 
the 
LDG 
part 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
be 
kept 
at 
the 
present 
10 
%. 
LGs 
will 
be 
permitted 
to 
fund 
their co-financing obligations 
from 
own 
revenue 
sources. 
The 
coming 
changes 
of 
the co-finance requirements 
within 
the 
FDS 
framework 
will 
have 
an impact 
on 
the 
overall 
intergovernmental 
fiscal 
transfer 
system, 
and 
LGDP 
I1 
will 
be 
flexible 
and 
if 
necessary, 
adjusted 
to 
these 
changes. 
2.7 
Investment 
Menu. 
The 
investment 
menu 
for 
the 
subprojects 
is 
defined 
as 
the 
Second Schedule 
of 
the 
Local 
Government 
Act, 
1997. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
performance 
assessment 
system, 
LGs 
will 
have 
an 
incentive 
to 
use 
minimum 
85 
% 
of 
the 
LDG 
on 
the 
PEAP 
areas. 
LGs 
are 
allowed 
to 
spend 
maximum 
5 
YO 
of 
the 
LDG 
on 
retooling, 
5 
YO 
on 
investment 
servicing 
costs 
and 
5 
% 
on 
monitoring 
costs, 
linked 
to 
the 
specific projects.

LGDP-formats). 
Releases 
of 
LDG. 
The 
release 
of 
funds 
to 
LGs 
will 
be 
made 
in 
quarterly 
installments 
against 
2.9 
Assessment 
System. 
The 
assessment 
system 
comprises 
(i) 
the 
Assessment 
Process, 
the 
key 
elements 
of 
which 
are 
listed 
below, 
and 
(ii) 
the 
Assessment 
Manual. 
A 
new 
manual 
(a 
redesigned 
version 
of 
the 
manual 
used 
for 
LGDP 
I) 
is 
being 
produced 
as 
part 
of 
the PIP. 
The 
National 
Assessment 
should be

made 
in 
Augusb'September 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
September 
each year. 
As 
part 
of 
the performance 
evaluation 
system, 
incentives 
and 
penalties 
would 
be 
applied wherein 
those 
LGs 
that 
perform 
adequately 
would 
be 
rewarded 
with 
access 
to 
20% 
additional 
funds 
and 
those 
who 
do not perform 
well 
would 
have 
their allocation 
reduced 
by 
20%.

Local 
Government 
Capacity 
Building 
This 
component 
will 
enhance 
the capacity 
of 
LGs 
to 
fulfill 
their 
mandates 
and 
to 
develop and 
test a 
system 
for 
sustained 
capacity 
building 
and 
training 
of 
LGs 
to 
meet 
the capacity 
building 
needs 
of 
individuals 
as 
well 
as 
organizations. 
This 
component 
is 
closely related 
to 
Component 
1 
sub-components 
on 
a 
National 
Strategic 
Framework 
for 
Capacity 
Building 
and Support 
to 
the 
LG 
HRD 
function, 
which 
ensures 
coordination, 
Quality 
Assurance, 
training 
materials 
and 
demand 
driven 
support 
to 
the 
LGs, 
especially concerning 
the 
design 
and 
utilization 
of 
the grants. 
An 
assessment 
of 
the capacity 
building 
and 
training 
activities 
within LGDP 
I, 
has 
revealed 
a 
need 
for 
increased 
quality 
as 
well 
as 
a 
need 
for 
a 
more 
coordinated effort. 
Thus, 
though 
much 
capacity 
building 
takes 
place 
at 
LG 
level 
(funded 
by 
a 
number 
of 
sources 
and 
agencies), 
it 
is 
to 
a 
large 
extent uncoordinated, 
often 
overlapping and 
with 
different 
(sometimes 
conflicting) 
approaches, 
content 
and methodologies. There 
is 
a 
need 
for 
establishing 
a 
national framework 
and 
system, 
which 
can 
provide 
the 
point 
of 
departure 
for 
a 
high 
quality 
national 
system, 
where 
the 
LGs 
themselves 
are 
empowered 
to 
define 
needs, 
procure 
and 
carry 
out 
training. 
3.1 
activities 
and 
are 
divided 
with 
35% 
to 
Districts/MCs 
and 
65% 
to 
lower 
LGs. 
The 
CBG 
under 
LGDP-I1 
will 
be 
structured 
differently, 
aiming 
at 
increasing 
the 
quality 
of 
training 
and 
to 
help 
establish 
a 
national 
system 
of 
standardized 
training 
modules recognized 
by 
all 
stakeholders. 
Thus, 
in 
LGDP 
I1 
much 
of 
the 
CBG 
provided to 
LGs 
would 
have 
to 
be used 
within 
a 
menu 
of 
specific 
courses. 
The 
course 
menu 
is 
developed based 
on 
capacity 
needs 
assessments 
carried out 
by 
LGs. 
The 
development 
of 
standardized 
training 
courses 
and 
the 
elaboration 
of 
a 
short-list 
of 
qualified 
national 
training 
providers 
will 
be 
coordinated 
by 
the 
LG 
Capacity 
Building 
Unit 
and 
the 
specific Technical 
Working 
Group 
on 
Standardized 
Training. 
The 
short-list 
of 
qualified training 
providers 
will 
be updated 
semi-annually. 
Among 
the 
providers 
on 
the 
shortlist, 
LGs 
will 
be 
able 
to 
purchase 
training 
courses 
according 
to 
their 
Capacity 
Building 
Plan. 
The 
grant 
will 
be restricted 
to 
non-sectoral, generic 
training 
and 
skills 
development. 
Horizontally, 
the 
grant 
will 
be 
allocated 
according 
to 
the 
formula 
for 
the 
Local 
Development Grant (according 
to 
population 
85% 
and 
geographical 
size 
15%). 
Vertically,

Local 
Government 
Revenue 
Enhancement 
This 
component 
is 
to 
enhance 
the capacity 
of 
local 
governments 
to 
administer 
their 
own 
sources 
of 
revenue 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
and 
sustain acceptable 
levels 
of 
service 
delivery. 
The 
Mid-Term 
Review 
of 
- 
36 
- 
Page  41
LGDP 
I 
indicated 
that 
the 
primary 
challenge 
confronting 
the 
Project 
lay 
in 
the 
area 
of 
sustainability. 
This 
challenge 
has 
become 
increasingly 
acute 
because 
of 
a deterioration 
of 
“own 
source” revenue 
mobilization 
by 
local 
authorities, 
the 
consequence 
of 
which 
has 
been 
to 
diminish 
the resources 
available 
to 
these 
authorities 
to 
fund 
(i) 
rising 
recurrent 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
maintenance 
and operation 
of 
the 
increasing stock 
of 
local 
infrastructure 
funded 
through 
LGDP 
and other development 
grants, 
and 
(ii) 
their 
counterpart 
funding 
obligations. 
It 
is 
fundamental to 
the 
sustainability goal 
of 
LGDP 
11 
that 
the 
Project 
support 
efforts to 
enhance 
the 
local 
revenue 
performance 
of 
local 
authorities. 
These 
activities 
will 
be 
undertaken 
in 
close association 
with 
a 
number 
of 
other 
activities underway 
to 
address 
local 
revenue 
enhancement 
in 
Uganda, 
and 
will 
be 
coordinated 
through 
the 
CCLRE. The 
following 
activities 
under 
this 
component 
are: 
4.1 
Strengthening 
Local 
Revenue 
Policies 
and 
Legislation. 
One 
of 
the factors responsible 
for 
the 
poor 
revenue 
performance 
in 
Uganda 
is 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
overall 
policy 
and legal 
environment 
relating 
to local 
revenues. 
This 
is 
especially evident 
with 
regard 
to 
three 
important 
revenue 
sources 
- 
Graduated 
Tax, 
Property Tax 
and 
the 
taxation 
of 
business and traders 
through 
a 
variety 
of 
local 
levies and 
duties. 
This 
sub-component 
will 
provide 
support 
to 
GoU, 
specifically 
MoLG, 
to 
improve 
the 
legal 
and 
policy 
environment around 
these 
revenue 
sources. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve 
this 
goal, 
the 
following 
activities 
will 
be 
undertaken: 
(i) 
a 
comprehensive 
review 
of 
GT 
policies 
and 
legislation 
will 
be 
undertaken 
and, 
on 
this 
basis, 
proposals 
will 
be 
formulated 
for 
improving 
the 
policy 
and 
law 
relating 
to 
this 
system 
specifically 
as 
regards 
tax 
base coverage, 
assessment 
procedures, 
administration 
and 
enforcement. 
A 
study 
will 
also 
be undertaken 
in 
order 
to 
assess 
and propose 
concrete 
options 
for 
replacing 
the 
GT 
with 
a 
more 
appropriate 
tax instrument 
at some 
future point; 
(ii) 
technical 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
Property 
Tax to 
inform 
the 
new 
Property Tax Legislation, 
i.e. 
the 
Local 
Governments 
(Rating) 
Bill 
and related 
Regulations; 
(iii) 
Business 
levies 
and 
fees. 
A 
thorough 
review 
of 
the 
current 
policies and legislation 
dealing 
with 
the 
licensing and regulation 
of 
businesses 
and 
traders 
and 
the 
possible 
development 
of 
a 
rationalized 
system 
of 
LG 
business 
taxation 
(in 
which 
the 
fiscal 
and 
regulatory 
aspects are 
clearly 
separated 
and 
which could 
replace 
a 
system 
of 
multiple 
licenses 
and 
duties and 
arbitrary tariffs) 
is 
required. 
As 
lessons 
could 
be 
learnt 
from 
recent 
changes 
to 
the 
system 
of 
business 
licensing 
in 
Kenya 
and 
studies 
in 
Malawi, 
the 
policies 
and 
practices 
in 
these 
countries (and 
possibly 
elsewhere) 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
review. 
4.2 
and educate 
political 
leaders 
and 
senior 
officials 
at 
both 
central and 
local 
government 
level 
on 
the 
important 
role 
of 
and 
need 
for 
local 
taxation 
to 
achieve 
more 
accountable 
and 
sustainable 
local 
government. 
The 
key 
function 
of 
such 
education 
is 
to 
enable 
central govemment 
politicians 
and 
government 
officials to provide 
local 
leaders the 
political 
and 
institutional 
support 
to 
collect 
their 
own 
sources 
of 
revenue. 
At 
the 
local 
level, 
local 
politicians 
and 
LG 
officials 
need 
to 
be 
able 
to 
grasp the 
importance 
of 
local 
taxes 
as 
a 
means 
to provide 
sustainable 
or 
improved 
levels 
of 
service 
delivery 
and 
to 
be 
able 
to 
explain 
the 
reciprocal 
needs 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
council 
and 
the 
community to 
the 
latter. 
To 
ensure 
that 
all 
LGs 
benefit 
from 
this 
training, 
training 
sessions 
for 
LG 
will 
have 
to 
be 
presented 
at 
appropriate 
regional 
locations. 
Training 
of 
Politicians 
and 
Officials. 
The 
sub-component 
would 
provide 
support 
to 
sensitize 
4.3 
Strengthening 
Local 
Revenue 
Systems. 
A 
third 
area 
of 
activity 
is 
to 
support 
nationwide efforts 
in 
the 
area 
of 
local 
revenue 
administration. 
In 
early 
2003, 
a comprehensive 
study 
which 
aims 
to 
identify

in 
all 
Uganda 
and 
to 
develop a 
set 
of 
manuals 
focusing 
on 
improvements 
to 
local 
revenue 
administration 
for 
implementation 
within 
local 
authorities 
will 
be carried 
out under 
District 
Development 
Program 
II. 
The 
manuals 
will 
then 
be

Economic Justification 
Summary 
UGANDA: 
Second Local Government Development 
Project 
1. 
first, 
the 
discretionaly 
development budget 
support 
to 
Local 
Governments 
(LGs) 
under 
Local 
Government 
Development 
Program 
I 
(LGDP 
I); 
and 
second, 
the 
specific 
and 
conditional 
grants 
to local 
governments 
primarily 
supported 
by 
other donors. 
The 
discretionary 
development budget 
support 
has 
little 
conditionality 
with 
respect 
to 
sector 
allocation 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
leaving 
these 
allocation 
decisions 
to 
be 
made 
according 
to 
local 
priorities 
through 
a 
transparent 
and participatory 
decision-making 
processes. 
The 
LGDP 
framework 
provides 
an 
emphasis 
on 
downward 
accountability 
to 
local 
communities. 
In 
contrast, 
sector speciJic 
and 
conditional grants 
to 
local 
governments 
primarily 
promote 
accountability 
upward to 
the 
sector 
ministry 
or 
special purpose 
fund 
providing 
the 
conditional 
grant. 
There 
are 
two 
main 
modes 
of 
financing 
for 
local 
governments 
development programs 
in 
Uganda: 
2. 
demand-driven 
discretionary investment allocation, planning, 
implementation and 
maintenance 
of 
investments 
in 
support 
of 
the decentralization 
process. 
As 
such, 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
LGDP 
investments 
required 
cannot 
be 
determined a 
priori. 
The 
justification 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
rests 
on 
demonstrating 
the 
following two 
hypotheses: 
(i) 
that 
the 
LGDP 
processes 
that 
are 
in 
place 
are 
functional 
and 
sustainable; 
and, 
(ii) 
that 
the 
LGDP 
priority 
investments 
identified, 
selected 
and implemented 
following 
the 
LGDP 
processes 
do 
achieve the 
desired 
output/impact. 
As 
designed, 
LGDP 
I1 
involves 
further 
testing 
and 
replicating 
a 
system 
of 
participatory, 
3. 
confirmed 
that 
the 
LGDP 
processes 
tested 
under 
tranche 
I 
& 
I1 
of 
LGDP 
I 
are 
functional. 
Furthermore, 
these 
processes are 
likely 
to form 
the 
framework 
for 
an 
economically, 
financially 
and socially viable 
demand-driven 
decentralized 
approach 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
infrastructure 
and service 
delivery 
by 
local 
governments. 
However, 
the 
MTR 
also 
highlighted 
the 
need 
for 
enhancing 
the 
revenue 
base 
of 
the 
LGs 
to 
ensure 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
investment 
made. 
The 
first 
of 
these 
hypotheses was 
validated 
during 
the 
MTR. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
assessment 
4. 
The 
viability 
of 
LGDP 
II 
depends 
on 
further 
demonstrating that the 
second 
hypothesis 
is 
also 
true. 
This 
hypothesis 
assumes 
that 
the 
decentralized decision-making 
framework 
for 
local 
investment 
interventions 
put 
in 
place under 
LGDP 
leads 
to 
the 
identification, 
selection and 
prioritization 
of 
economically 
and 
socially viable 
investment interventions 
by 
local 
governments. 
5. 
Under 
tranche 
I 
and 
I1 
of 
LGDP 
I 
a 
total 
of 
1,896 
and 
2,849 
subprojects 
respectively, financed 
investments 
in 
water 
supply, 
footpaths, 
roads, 
drainage, sanitation, 
solid 
waste, 
street 
lighting, 
abattoir, 
schools, 
clinics, 
etc. 
The 
total 
costs 
for 
these 
respective 
tranches were 
Ush. 
10.6 
billion 
and 
Ush. 
18.8 
billion. 
The 
quality 
of 
the 
respective 
tranches was 
assessed 
to 
be 
86% 
and 
88% 
satisfactory. 
6. 
Since 
it 
is 
difficult to 
ascertain 
a 
priori 
the 
economic 
feasibility 
of 
the 
LGDP 
I1 
investment, 
the 
justification 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
data 
collected 
on 
tranche 
I 
and tranche 
I1 
under 
LGDP 
I. 
To 
this 
end, 
the 
following 
assessments 
were undertaken 
under 
LGDP 
I 
for 
the 
education 
and 
road 
sectors 
(where 
substantial 
investments 
have gone 
and 
the 
program) 
as 
a 
whole 
from 
the 
social and 
economic 
benefit 
perspectives: 
(i) 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
the education 
sector investments- 
23.6% 
to 
24% 
of 
total 
investment; 
(ii) 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
the 
road 
sector investments 
- 
32.6% 
to 
38.9% 
of 
total 
investment; 
(iii) 
cost-benefit analysis 
for 
a 
typical 
water subproject investment 
- 
7.8% 
to 
11.4% 
of 
total 
investment 
(iv) 
overall 
social 
benefits 
-

(discretionary 
& 
conditional) 
show 
significant 
differences 
in 
unit 
costs. 
In 
fact, 
based 
on 
the 
sample subprojects 
financed 
using 
the 
two 
approaches 
in 
the 
same 
locality, 
it 
was 
found 
that 
the 
LGDP 
approach 
was 
more 
cost-effective 
than 
the 
non-LGDP 
approach. 
Quantitatively, 
on 
average, 
under the 
LGDP 
approach 
the 
cost 
of 
a 
standard 
classroom 
(8 
m 
x 6 
m) 
was 
Ush.3,920,775 
compared 
to 
USh.6,206,522 
under 
the 
non-LGDP 
approach. 
Similarly, 
the 
cost 
of 
a 
standard 
desk 
(3-seater-twin 
desks) 
was Ush.46,7 14 
under 
LGDP 
approach 
compared 
to 
Ush.58,4 10 
under 
non-LGDP 
approach, 
or 
80% 
of 
the 
later 
approach. 
The 
investments 
in 
the 
education sector (classrooms, 
desks, etc.) 
identified 
by

of 
the

respectively. 
The 
proposed 
upgrading 
of 
roads consisted 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
short 
road 
sections 
with 
different 
design 
standards, 
averaging 
in 
most communities 
0.5 
to 
2 
km 
in 
length 
per 
roadfootpath 
section. 
Most 
of 
these 
roads 
are 
characterized 
by 
poor 
surface 
conditions. 
Since 
the 
tertiary 
roads 
are 
predominantly 
on-site 
and 
local 
service roads, 
and 
not major 
collectors 
or 
trunk, 
data 
on 
traffic 
is 
not 
available. 
Moreover, 
car ownership 
is 
low 
in 
these 
communities 
as 
income levels 
are 
low. 
Public 
transport 
is 
used 
for 
home 
to 
work/ 
marketlcenter 
of 
services 
trips 
only 
where roads 
are 
passable. 
As 
traffic 
is 
generally 
low, 
the 
main 
benefit 
of 
upgrading 
of 
these 
roadslfootpaths 
and associated 
drains 
is 
to 
improve 
access 
for 
public 
transport, 
to 
serve 
as 
emergency roads 
or 
improve 
access. 
Therefore, 
undertaking 
a 
traditional 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
was 
not 
considered 
as 
a good 
indicator 
of 
the 
investment benefits. 
The

and 
footpaths 
identified 
by 
participating 
Local 
Governments

cost-effectiveness 
index. 
The index 
is 
based 
on 
the assumption that 
only 
people 
within 
a 
limited 
walking 
distance 
from 
the 
footpathlroad 
are 
likely 
to benefit 
from 
such an investment. 
This 
index 
is 
therefore 
highly 
dependent 
on 
the 
density 
of 
the 
population 
of 
the 
community. 
The 
values 
of 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
index 
range 
around 
Ush.752 
per 
person 
for 
a 
footpath 
to 
Ush. 
967 
per 
person 
for 
a 
road 
(less 
than 
a 
dollar 
per 
person). 
The 
results 
indicate 
that 
for 
a 
given 
technical 
standards selected, 
the 
higher 
the density 
of 
people 
along 
the 
roadfootpath, 
the 
more 
cost-effective the 
investment. 
The 
LGDP 
processes appear 
to 
prioritize 
subprojects 
which 
tend 
to 
serve 
a 
large 
number 
of 
people 
per 
unit 
of 
investment and 
are 
therefore cost-effective. 
An 
approach 
to 
measure 
the 
efficiency 
of 
resource 
allocations 
in 
roadslfootpaths 
is 
to 
use 
a

about 
11.4% 
and

respectively. 
A

been 
completed 
under

at

The 
benefits 
are 
based 
on 
willingness 
to 
pay, 
and timelcost 
savings. 
Prior 
to 
the 
supply 
of 
water 
through 
standpipes, 
household 
members 
who 
fetch 
water 
from 
spring 
often 
wait 
one 
to 
two 
hours 
to 
purchase 
from 
vendors 
who 
deliver 
water 
to 
households 
with 
20-liter 
can. 
In 
addition, 
the 
availability 
of 
-41 
- 
Page  46
piped 
water 
reduces 
the incidence 
of 
water 
borne 
diseases 
and 
this 
benefit 
is 
not quantified 
in 
the 
analysis. 
A 
typical 
standpipe 
investment 
costs 
about 
Ush.4 
million. 
On 
the 
average, 
daily 
consumption 
per 
average 
household 
of 
6 
members 
is 
60 
liters 
(about 10 
liters 
per 
household 
member). 
A 
standpipe 
is 
likely 
to 
serve 
about 100 households. 
Maintenance 
and operation per 
year 
would 
cost about 
15% 
of 
the 
total 
investment 
cost. 
The 
asset 
life 
of 
the 
investment 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
20 
years. 
The 
investment 
yields an 
ERR 
of 
17% 
and a 
NPV 
of

A

analysis, 
with 
the

by

and 
no

in

yields an 
ERR 
of 
12% 
and 
NPV 
of 
Ush.O.56 
million, indicating 
a 
robust 
result.

It 
is 
difficult 
and 
time 
consuming 
to quantify 
individually 
the 
benefit 
of 
such 
projects. However, 
it 
is 
not 
difficult 
in 
the 
aggregate 
to 
demonstrate 
that improvements 
in 
the 
physical 
environment and 
in 
the

of

positive 
benefits 
on 
the 
health 
and

Most 
of 
the illnesses 
in 
these 
communities 
are 
infectious 
diseases 
that 
are 
exacerbated 
by 
the 
deteriorating 
physical 
living 
conditions 
in 
the 
LGs. 
The 
incidence 
of 
such 
diseases 
is 
higher 
in 
poorer communities. 
As 
a result, household 
members 
suffered 
loss 
of 
working 
days 
and school 
days 
due 
to 
illnesses. 
Uganda 
has 
an 
average 
per 
capita 
income 
of 
US$260 
per 
year 
or 
USS1560 
per 
household 
per 
year 
or US$6 
per 
working 
day. 
A 
saving 
of 
two 
working 
days 
income 
per 
household 
due 
to 
improved 
environmental conditions attributable 
to 
this 
project could 
result 
in 
savings 
of 
US$12.0 
per 
year 
per 
household. 
A 
further 
saving 
in 
medical 
expenses 
of 
1 
% 
of 
average 
household income 
would 
result 
in 
US15.60 
per 
household. 
The 
total 
annual savings 
per 
household 
per 
year 
would 
amount 
to 
US$27.20. 
The 
maximum 
investment 
per household 
over 
the three-year 
period 
is 
USS36.00. 
With 
an 
economic 
life 
of 
10 
years, 
the 
benefit 
to

ratio 
would 
be 
9.2. 
Even 
assuming 
a 
aggregate 
service 
life 
of 
5 
years, 
the 
benefit-cost 
ratio 
would 
be 
4.6. 
The 
health 
statistics 
collected 
at 
district levels indicate 
that

waste, 
street 
lighting, 
abattoir, 
schools and 
clinics- 
in 
the 
participating 
LGs 
would 
also 
lead 
to 
an 
appreciation 
in 
the 
property 
value 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
interventions. 
An 
informal 
survey among 
representatives 
of 
the 
participating 
districts indicated 
that 
similar 
rooms 
located 
in 
better 
serviced 
locations 
would 
have 
higher rental 
values 
of 
10% 
and 
20%. 
Given 
the large number 
of 
owner 
occupied 
homes 
with 
permanent structures 
in 
the 
urban 
areas, 
significant 
benefit 
can accrue 
to 
the 
owners 
from 
an 
appreciation 
of 
the 
value 
of 
their 
properties. 
As 
many 
factors 
affect property 
value, 
a 
single 
indicator 
would 
not 
capture 
all 
of 
the 
benefits. 
Nevertheless, 
differential 
rent 
is 
a 
good 
proxy 
of 
benefit arising 
from 
appreciation 
of 
property 
value 
due 
to improved 
physical 
environment 
or 
the 
addition 
basic services 
in 
proximity. 
As 
an 
indication, 
a 
10% 
increase 
in 
a 
rental 
value 
of 
a 
room 
that 
rents 
for 
US$lO.OO 
per 
month 
would 
result 
in 
saving 
of 
US$l 
dollars 
per 
month.

In 
summary, the 
analyses 
undertaken 
above 
indicate 
that 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
11 
investments 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
viable. 
The 
feasibility 
measures 
indicate that 
the

is 
cost-effective;

and 
(iii)

In 
the 
aggregate, 
the 
results

confirm 
that the

that 
is 
in

is 
indeed functional

Risks 
17. 
The 
main 
lesson learned 
from 
the 
implementation 
experience 
of 
tranche 
I 
& 
I1 
of 
LGDP 
I 
is 
that 
the design 
is 
basically 
sound 
and 
its 
key 
components 
merit 
continued 
support 
under 
a 
follow-on 
project. 
However, 
the 
MTR 
also 
concluded that 
the 
Government's 
decentralization 
policy 
could 
be undermined 
if 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
local 
governments 
in 
mobilizing 
own-source revenue 
is 
not 
improved 
in 
a 
sustainable manner. 
This 
risk 
is 
being 
mitigated through 
addition 
of 
Local 
Government Revenue 
Enhancement 
measures. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
investments 
is 
small relative 
to 
the 
GDP 
and 
represent less 
than 
0.5% 
of 
the 
GDP, 
and 
thus 
the 
impact 
on 
the Government's finances 
is 
relatively 
small. 
The 
risk 
of 
not 
getting 
the 
required 
counterpart 
financing 
from 
the 
Government 
is 
also 
relatively 
small.

Annex 6(A):  Procurement 
Arrangements 
UGANDA Second 
Local Government 
Development Project 
Procurement 
General 
1. 
Public 
procurement 
procedures 
in 
Uganda 
are 
undergoing reform. 
In 
November 
2002, 
new 
procurement 
legislation 
based 
on 
the 
UNCITRAL 
model 
was passed 
by 
Parliament 
and 
was 
subsequently 
signed 
into law 
by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Uganda 
on 
December 19,2002, 
resulting 
in 
“The 
Public 
Procurement 
and Disposal 
of 
Public 
Assets 
Act, 
2003 
”. 
The 
Bank 
contributed 
substantially 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
new 
legislation. 
The 
supporting regulations 
have 
been 
drafted and 
are 
under 
review 
by 
the 
Bank 
and 
other donors. 
The 
Minister 
of 
Finance 
will 
appoint 
the commencement day 
of 
the 
Act 
by 
Statutory Instrument 
once 
the regulations 
are 
finalized. 
2. 
The 
new 
Act 
applies 
to 
all 
public 
procurement 
and 
disposal 
activities 
undertaken 
by 
public 
institutions, 
including 
parastatal 
organizations 
and 
defense 
procurement. 
It 
specifies 
Accounting 
Officers, 
Contract Committees 
or 
Tender Boards 
(in 
case 
of 
Local 
Governments), 
Procurement and 
Disposal 
Units, 
and 
User 
Departments 
for 
procuring 
entities 
each 
with 
a 
different 
responsibility. 
Until 
the 
new 
law 
is 
operational, 
CG 
and 
LG 
procurements 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
under 
different 
legal 
frameworks. 
3. 
At 
the 
CG 
level, 
“The 
Public 
Finance 
(Procurement) Regulations, 
2000 
” 
abolished 
the 
then 
Central 
Tender 
Board 
(CTB) 
and 
created a 
procurement 
regulatory 
body, 
the 
Reformed Central 
Tender 
Board 
(RCTB). 
In 
place 
of 
the 
CTB, 
contract committees were 
set 
up 
in 
all 
procuring 
entities 
to 
award 
contracts 
while 
procurement 
units 
are 
being 
built 
up 
to 
prepare, issue 
and 
evaluate tenders 
as 
the technical 
units 
on 
procurement. 
The 
procuring 
entities 
without 
adequate 
capacity 
are 
required 
to 
employ 
procurement 
agents 
to 
support 
their 
procurement 
units. 
4. 
At 
the 
LG 
level, 
“Local 
Government Act, 
1997” 
and 
the 
“Local 
Government 
Financial 
and 
Accounting 
Regulations, 
1998 
”are 
the 
legal 
instruments 
for 
controlling 
procurement 
in 
public 
entities. 
Under 
this 
law, each 
district 
has 
set 
up 
a 
District 
Local 
Government Tender 
Board (DLGTB) 
while 
each 
municipal council 
has 
set 
up 
an 
Urban 
Tender 
Board 
to 
award 
contracts. 
These 
Tender Boards 
appointed 
by 
the 
councils 
from 
the 
citizenry 
are 
supported 
by 
a Secretary 
to 
the 
Board 
nominated 
by 
the 
Chief 
Administrative 
Officers 
and 
by 
Town 
Clerks 
from 
among 
their 
staff 
and 
appointed 
by 
the 
Councils 
for 
the 
districts 
and 
municipal 
councils 
respectively. 
The Technical 
Officers 
of 
the 
districts 
or 
urban 
councils 
thus 
serve 
as 
part 
of 
the 
‘Procurement 
Units’ 
(in 
the 
CG 
level 
arrangement) together 
with 
the 
Tender 
Board 
Secretaries.

of

Act, 1997) 
” 
is 
also 
widely 
used 
by 
the 
Tender 
Boards 
to 
guide 
procurement. 
At 
the 
sub-counties, 
there 
is 
currently 
no 
clear 
legal 
structure 
for 
procurement 
activities 
and 
the 
practice 
is 
for 
the 
DLGTB 
to 
set 
thresholds 
for 
procurement 
within 
the 
sub-county 
where 
the 
sub-county 
Technical Committee 
processes 
the 
tenders 
and 
the 
sub-county 
Investment 
Committee 
awards 
the 
contracts. 
All 
the 
contracts 
awarded 
by 
sub-counties 
are 
then 
reviewed 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis 
by 
the 
DLGTB.

Implementation 
of 
the 
new 
law 
includes 
the 
harmonization 
of 
the procurement regulations and 
practices at 
both 
the 
CG 
and 
LG 
levels. 
The 
Bank 
intends 
to 
provide 
assistance 
in 
implementing 
the 
new 
procurement 
legislation 
and 
regulations 
through 
various 
interventions 
among 
which 
is 
supporting the 
roll 
out 
of 
the 
harmonization 
under 
Component

All 
procurement 
of 
goods 
and

under 
components 
1,4,

will 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
“Guidelines: 
Procurement under

and 
IDA 
Credits, January 1995, revised 
August 
1996,

All 
procurement 
of 
consultant services 
under 
components 1,4,

would 
be 
done 
in

Procurements 
under 
components 
2 
and 
3 
at 
the 
LG 
level 
utilizing 
the 
LDG 
and 
CBG 
funds 
will 
be guided 
by 
national 
procedures acceptable 
to 
the 
PPDA 
and provided 
they 
are consistent 
with 
the 
IDA 
guidelines 
both 
prior 
to 
and 
after

Procurement 
Capacity 
7. 
A 
Country 
Procurement Assessment 
Report 
(CPAR) completed 
in 
February 
2001 
identified 
the 
lack 
of 
adequate 
procurement 
capacity 
as 
the 
single most 
important 
issue 
in 
public 
sector 
procurement 
in 
Uganda. 
This 
has 
been 
confirmed 
in 
another 
study 
carried 
out 
in 
70 
procuring 
entities at 
CG 
and 
LG 
levels. 
One 
of 
the 
interim 
solutions that 
is 
suggested 
in 
the 
CPAR 
is 
the employment 
of 
consultants 
to 
assist 
weak 
procurement 
units.

will 
depend 
on 
the 
LG 
prioritized 
sub-projects 
and 
is 
not 
known 
‘a 
priori’. 
Whereas 
the type 
of 
activities 
to 
be 
financed 
under 
the 
project 
have 
been 
defined, the 
specific procurements 
(goods, 
works 
and 
services) 
to 
support 
these 
activities 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
defined 
precisely. 
This 
is 
particularly 
true 
for 
activities 
under 
Component 
2 
(about 
70% 
of 
the 
Project) 
where 
actual 
access 
to 
the 
LDG 
funding 
by 
a 
district 
will 
be 
determined 
by 
capacity, 
accountability,  and performance 
conditionalities 
and 
to 
be 
utilized 
for 
investment 
in 
local 
infrastructure 
in 
accordance 
with 
local 
needs 
as 
these are 
determined 
through 
local 
planning 
and

the 
PCU) 
at 
the 
CG 
level 
and 
within 
the 
structures 
of 
the 
LGs. 
A 
Procurement 
Capacity 
Assessment 
was 
carried 
out and concluded 
that 
the 
Overall 
Procurement 
Risk 
is 
Average at 
the 
CG 
level 
and 
High 
at the 
LG 
level. 
In 
conjunction 
with 
this 
assessment, 
the 
Bank 
has 
recommended, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
(i) 
the 
MoLG 
should retain 
the 
Procurement Specialist 
currently 
contracted 
in 
the 
PMU 
for 
LGDP 
I 
to 
support 
the 
ministry’s 
Procurement 
Unit 
where 
another Procurement 
Specialist 
of 
equivalent 
or 
higher 
qualifications 
should 
be 
recruited before 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
project; 
(ii) 
the 
POM 
detailing 
the 
procurement 
procedures 
to 
be 
used 
under 
the 
program 
should 
be 
availed 
to 
all 
staff who 
will 
deal 
with 
procurement 
for 
the 
program 
to 
enable 
them 
carry out their 
procurement 
responsibilities 
in 
an 
efficient 
manner; 
(iii) 
the 
Procuring 
Entities 
would 
use 
IDA’s 
Standard 
Bidding 
Documents 
and Standard 
Form 
of 
Evaluation 
for 
ICB 
and 
NCB 
(with 
modifications) 
procurement; 
(iv) 
the 
Procuring 
Entities 
would 
use 
IDA’s 
Standard 
Request 
for 
Proposals 
and 
Standard 
Form 
of 
Evaluation 
for 
the 
selection 
of 
Consultants; and 
(v) 
when 
the 
new 
Public 
Procurement and 
Disposal 
of 
Assets 
Authority 
issues 
acceptable 
Bidding 
Documents, Request 
for 
Proposals 
or 
Evaluation Forms 
these 
may be 
used 
for 
NCB 
procurement 
at 
the 
CG 
level 
and 
for 
procurement and selection 
of 
consultants 
at 
the 
LG 
level. 
Procurement 
in 
this 
project 
will 
be 
mainstreamed 
within 
the 
structure 
of 
the 
MoLG 
(supported 
by 
10. 
To 
ensure 
that 
there 
is 
continued capacity 
building 
in 
the 
area 
of 
procurement, 
the 
Procurement 
Specialists 
at 
the 
MoLG 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Secretaries 
to 
the 
Tender 
Boards 
and other procurement 
staff 
will 
receive 
further 
training 
in 
procurement. 
In 
particular, 
the 
staff 
involved 
with 
procurement 
at 
the 
CG 
level 
will 
receive 
training 
in 
IDA 
procurement procedures 
to 
enhance 
their 
skills.

1. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
efforts 
to 
harmonize procurement practices 
at 
the 
LG 
with 
those 
at 
the CG, 
MoLG 
has 
initiated 
plans 
to 
establish 
Procurement 
Units 
at 
each 
Higher 
Local 
Government 
(HLG) 
i.e. 
the 
56 
-46- 
Page  51
districts 
and 
18 
municipalities. The 
Procurement 
Units 
under 
the 
Public 
Procurement and 
Disposal 
of 
Public 
Assets 
Act 
(PPDPAA), 
2003 
act 
as 
Secretariats 
of 
the 
Tender 
Boards 
of 
the 
LGs 
thereby 
replacing 
the 
current 
Secretaries 
to 
Tender 
Boards. 
To 
support 
this 
effort 
therefore, 
under component 
1 
of 
LGDP 
11, 
each 
of 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
Procurement 
Units 
and 
their 
assistant, 
the 
district 
or municipal 
engineer, 
and 
the 
director 
of 
health 
services 
for 
each 
of 
the 
74 
HLG 
will 
be 
assisted 
to 
undertake 
a 
basic procurement 
course. 
Subsequently, 
these 
four 
staff 
will 
form 
the 
core 
of 
key 
procurement 
staff 
and 
will 
be 
assisted 
to 
attend 
issues-based 
and specialized 
procurement 
training twice 
per 
year 
as 
a 
follow 
up. 
The four 
key 
procurement 
staff 
in 
the 
HLGs 
will 
also 
be 
equipped 
with 
presentation 
materials 
and 
skills 
for 
use 
in 
sensitizing 
the members 
of 
their 
Tender 
Boards and Evaluation 
Committees 
on 
an on-going 
basis. 
Procurement 
Planning 
and 
Monitoring 
12. 
The 
MoLG 
has 
prepared a 
procurement 
plan 
for 
components 
1,4 
and 
5 
to 
cover 
the 
entire 
period 
of 
LGDP 
Il 
and detailed 
procurement 
plans 
for 
the 
first 
Project 
year. 
The 
first 
year 
procurement 
plan 
includes relevant 
information 
on 
all 
goods, 
and 
consulting 
services 
expected 
to 
be 
procured, 
the 
procurement 
unit 
responsible and 
their 
estimated 
cost; 
type 
of 
contract; 
procurement/selection 
method 
as 
well 
as 
timing 
in 
the 
procurement process. 
The procurement 
plan 
will 
be 
updated 
on 
an 
annual basis 
in 
conjunction 
with 
preparation 
of 
the 
Annual 
Work 
Project 
and 
Budget. 
The 
procurement plans 
at 
the 
LG 
level 
will 
be 
prepared 
as 
part 
of 
their 
local 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
process against 
which 
they 
will 
access 
both 
the 
LDG 
and 
the 
CBG 
funds 
for 
sub-projects. 
13. 
A 
General 
Procurement 
Notice 
(GPN) 
is 
mandatory 
and 
must 
be published 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
Development 
Business 
(UNDB) 
and 
in 
national 
newspaper 
as 
provided 
under 
the 
Guidelines, 
immediately 
after 
negotiations. 
The 
GPN 
would 
be 
updated 
on 
a 
yearly 
basis 
and 
would 
show 
all 
outstanding 
International Competitive 
Bidding 
(ICB) 
for 
goods 
contacts 
and 
all 
International Consulting 
Services. 
Specific 
Procurement 
Notices 
for 
goods 
to 
be procured 
under 
ICB 
and Expressions 
of 
Interest 
for 
consultant 
services estimated 
to 
cost 
the equivalent 
of 
US$200,000 
and 
above 
will 
also 
be 
published 
in 
the 
UNDB. 
Details 
of 
project 
costs 
by 
procurement 
arrangements 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
A. 
14. 
Monitoring 
and evaluation 
of 
procurement performance 
at 
all 
levels 
(national, 
HLGs 
and 
LLGs) 
will 
be carried out through 
prior 
reviews 
for 
procurements 
above 
the 
prior 
review 
thresholds and 
through 
annual 
ex-post 
procurement 
audits 
and regular 
ad 
hoc 
reviews 
for 
all 
procurements 
not 
subject 
to 
prior 
reviews. 
Independent Procurement 
Reviews 
of 
the 
Project 
will 
also 
be 
conducted 
every 
two 
years. 
15. 
Such audits 
would: 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
verify 
that 
the 
procurement and 
contracting 
procedures 
and 
processes 
followed 
for 
the 
projects 
were 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Development Financing 
Agreement 
(DFA); 
verify 
technical 
compliance, 
physical 
completion 
and 
price 
competitiveness 
of 
each 
contract 
in 
the 
selected representative 
sample; 
review 
and 
comment 
on 
contract 
administration 
and 
management 
issues 
as 
dealt 
with 
by 
participating 
LGs; 
review 
capacity 
of 
participating 
LGs 
in 
handling 
procurement 
efficiently; 
and 
identify 
improvements 
in 
the 
procurement 
process 
in 
the 
light 
of 
any 
identified 
deficiencies. 
16. 
Monitoring 
of 
procurements 
shall 
start 
with 
setting 
up 
procurement 
indicators 
at 
the 
MoLG, 
district 
and 
LLG 
levels 
in 
consultation 
with 
the Procurement Specialist and Tender 
Board 
secretaries 
or 
heads 
of 
Procurement 
Units 
wherever 
these 
have 
been 
established and 
recruitments 
done. 
The 
team 
entrusted 
with 
monitoring 
shall 
use the established 
indicators 
to 
assess 
whether 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
goods, 
works 
and 
services 
procured 
matches the 
funds 
spent. 
The 
new 
Procurement 
Specialist 
will 
head 
the Procurement 
-

- 
Page  52
Unit 
at 
the 
MoLG 
and 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
monitoring 
procurement 
activities 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
existing 
Procurement 
Specialist 
at 
PMU 
and 
the 
Tender 
Board 
Secretaries 
(TBS) 
or 
new 
heads 
of 
Procurement 
Units. 
The 
TBS 
will 
monitor 
and coordinate procurement 
activities 
in 
collaboration 
with 
sub-county 
authorities. 
These 
will 
be 
achieved 
through, 
MoLG 
setting 
prior review 
thresholds 
for 
the 
HLG 
procurements, 
and 
carrying 
out 
post 
procurement 
reviews 
on 
a 
satisfactory 
sample 
of 
contracts 
not 
subject 
to 
their 
prior 
review 
on 
an 
arrangement 
similar 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Bank 
Procurement 
Guidelines, 
and 
special 
field 
visits 
to 
the 
districts 
and 
sub-counties 
to 
assess 
procurement 
procedures 
followed for 
a 
sample 
of 
contracts 
at 
least once 
every 
quarter. 
The 
independent 
procurement 
reviews 
once 
every 
two 
years 
by 
MoLG 
will 
be 
done 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Public 
Procurement 
and 
Disposal 
of 
Assets 
Authority 
(PDPAA) 
by 
hiring 
consultants 
to 
conduct 
the 
review 
of 
a 
satisfactory 
sample 
of 
both 
prior 
and 
post 
review 
contracts 
in 
all 
the 
74 
HLGs. 
The 
consultant’s 
report 
will 
be 
shared 
with 
IDA. 
17. 
The 
procurement 
monitoring 
arrangements 
stipulated 
here 
to 
be 
conducted 
by 
MoLG 
will 
done 
in 
parallel 
to 
and complement 
those 
of 
IDA 
under 
the Procurement Guidelines. 
Procurement 
Implementation 
Arrangements 
18. 
Procurement 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
using 
MoLG 
structures created 
under 
the 
new 
procurement 
law. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the day 
to 
day procurement 
carried out 
by 
the 
Procurement 
Specialist 
availed 
by 
the 
ministry 
specifically 
to 
deal 
with 
procurement 
activities related 
to 
this 
project. 
The 
Procurement Specialist 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
among other 
things: 
(i) 
preparation 
of 
the 
GPN 
and 
its 
annual updates; 
(ii) 
preparation 
of 
SPNs; 
(iii) 
draft 
bidding 
documents and 
RFPs; 
(iv) 
draft 
contract 
documents; 
and 
(v) 
contract 
administration 
and 
management. 
In 
recruiting 
or 
employing 
consultants, 
the 
department 
or 
unit 
in 
need 
of 
the 
consultant 
will 
be responsible 
for 
drafting TORS 
and 
will 
coordinate 
with 
the 
Procurement Specialist 
for 
further 
processing. 
A 
Procurement 
Evaluation Committee 
will 
be 
constituted 
on 
an 
ad 
hoc 
basis 
to 
evaluate 
bids 
and 
proposals. 
The 
Procurement Specialist 
is 
already 
Secretary 
to 
the Contracts 
Committee, 
and 
so 
he 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
quality 
assurance 
of 
all 
procurement 
documents 
prior 
to 
presentation 
to 
the Contracts 
Committee 
for 
approval 
or 
contract 
award. 
At 
the 
LG 
level, 
the 
existing 
structures 
will 
be 
used 
in 
a 
similar 
manner. 
However, 
there, 
the 
Heads 
of 
Departments 
of 
the 
LGs 
will 
each 
be 
responsible 
for 
drafting 
bidding 
documents 
and 
RFPs 
as 
well 
as 
for 
contract 
administration 
and management 
for 
procurements 
falling 
within 
their 
departments. 
The 
TBSs 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
quality 
assurance 
of 
all 
procurement 
documents 
prior to 
presentation 
to 
their 
Tender 
Boards 
for 
approval 
or 
contract 
award. 
19. 
The 
PIP 
has 
been prepared 
in 
which 
details 
of 
procurement 
procedures 
including 
standard 
forms 
to 
be 
used, are 
outlined. 
The 
PIP 
is 
a 
living 
document 
that 
will 
be 
updated 
as 
new 
developments 
in 
the 
procurement 
reforms 
will 
be incorporated 
subject 
to 
agreement 
between 
GoU 
and 
IDA.

(Januaiy 
1997; 
Revised 
September 
1997, January 
1999 
andMay

Consultant 
selection 
for 
the 
assignments 
will 
be 
addressed 
through competition 
among 
qualified 
short-listed 
firms 
or 
individuals 
in 
which 
the selection 
will 
be 
based 
on 
Quality-and-Cost-Based 
Selection 
(QCBS) 
by 
evaluating 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
proposal 
before comparing 
the 
cost 
of 
the services 
to 
be 
provided. 
For 
contracts 
of 
a 
routine 
nature estimated 
to 
cost 
less 
than

addition 
selection 
shall 
also 
be 
done based 
on 
other 
methods 
as 
provided 
for

the 
guidelines. 
To 
ensure 
that 
priority 
is 
given 
to 
the 
identification 
of 
suitable and 
qualified 
national 
consultants, 
shortlists 
for 
contracts estimated 
under 
USS200,OOO 
may 
comprise 
entirely 
of 
national 
consulting 
firms 
if 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
qualified 
(at least three) 
are 
available 
at 
competitive 
costs. 
However, 
if 
foreign 
firms 
have expressed 
interest, 
they shall 
not 
be 
excluded 
from 
consideration. 
In 
exceptional 
cases, 
and 
when 
it 
is 
beneficial 
to 
the 
Client 
and 
the 
project, consultancy contracts 
may

Training 
and 
Workshops. 
Training, 
workshops, 
and 
study 
tours 
will 
be carried 
out 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
approved annual programs that

tourslworkshops, 
the 
number 
of 
trainees, 
and 
cost 
estimates. 
Selection 
of 
training 
institutions 
for

based 
on 
a 
competitive 
process 
using 
the 
Quality

selection 
(QBS) method. 
Components 
2 
and 
3 
24. 
The 
procedures 
for 
procurements 
of 
sub-projects 
under 
Component 2 
will 
follow 
the current 
practices 
at 
the 
LG 
level 
until 
harmonization 
of 
the 
regulations and practices 
with 
those 
at 
the 
CG 
level. 
To 
ensure 
monitoring 
and 
back-up 
particularly 
where the 
estimated 
contract 
values 
are 
considered 
large, 
the 
MoLG 
will 
set 
acceptable 
Prior Review 
Thresholds 
(PRTs) above 
which 
bidding 
documents 
drafted 
at 
the 
HLG 
and 
the 
evaluation 
reports and 
award 
decisions 
of 
the 
HLG 
Tender 
Boards 
will 
be 
reviewed 
before 
issuance 
and 
contract 
award 
respectively. 
These 
reviews shall 
be 
conducted 
expeditiously 
in 
order 
not to 
interrupt implementation 
plans and 
MoLG 
will 
make 
adequate 
arrangements 
to 
ensure 
that 
responses 
to review 
requests 
are 
delivered 
in 
a 
period not 
exceeding 
12 
working 
days. 
LLGs 
will 
have 
inputs 
into 
the 
procurement 
of 
training 
under 
component 
3, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
will 
select the 
appropriate 
training 
according 
to 
identified 
needs. 
For both 
HLGs 
and 
LLGs, 
the courses 
are 
to 
be 
vetted 
and 
providers 
prequalified 
by 
the 
MoLG 
and the 
LGs 
will 
directly 
contract 
from 
the 
menu 
of 
providers 
for 
a selection 
from 
the 
menu 
of 
courses. 
25. 
The 
Procurement 
Guidelines 
and 
Arrangements, 
Section 
5 
of 
the 
PIP 
details 
out 
the 
procedures 
and 
approval 
responsibilities 
as 
well 
as 
the 
monitoring 
mechanisms 
for 
procurement 
at 
the 
LG 
level. 
The 
procurements 
at 
the 
LG 
and 
LLG 
levels 
are 
of 
small 
value and 
falling below prior review 
thresholds 
for 
both 
selection 
of 
consultants 
and procurement 
of 
works, goods 
and 
equipment. 
However 
the 
allocation 
procedures 
of 
the 
LDG 
will 
ensure 
that 
there 
is 
adequate 
capacity 
to 
carry out 
any procurements 
of 
significant 
value at 
the 
LG 
level 
before 
the 
allocatiodtransfer 
is 
made. 
The 
Procurement Specialist 
at 
the 
MoLG 
shall 
constantly 
review 
procurement capacity 
for 
this 
purpose.

providers 
under 
the 
scheme 
developed 
during 
the

development 
courses 
for both 
staff 
and councilors 
of 
the

by 
the 
HLGs 
and 
LLGs

in 
which 
case 
the 
Secretary 
to 
the 
Tender 
Board or 
the 
sub-county 
chief 
will 
be 
available 
to 
support

Summary 
Risk 
Analysis 
1.2 
The 
objectives 
of 
the project’s 
financial 
management 
system 
are: 
to 
ensure 
that 
funds 
are 
used 
only 
for 
their intended 
purposes 
in 
an 
efficient 
and 
economical 
way 
while 
implementing 
agreed 
activities; 
to 
enable the 
preparation 
of 
accurate and 
timely 
financial 
reports; 
to 
ensure 
that 
funds 
are 
properly 
managed 
and 
flow 
smoothly, adequately, 
regularly 
and 
predictably 
to 
implementing 
agencies; 
to 
enable 
project 
management 
to 
monitor 
the 
efficient 
implementation 
of 
the 
project; and 
to 
safeguard 
the 
project 
assets 
and 
resources. 
1.3 
Furthermore, 
the 
following 
are 
necessary features 
of 
a strong 
financial 
management 
system: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
the 
Project Coordination 
Unit 
should 
have 
an 
adequate 
number 
and 
mix 
of 
skilled 
and 
experienced staff; 
the 
internal 
control 
system 
should 
ensure 
the conduct 
of 
an 
orderly 
and 
efficient 
payment and 
procurement 
process, 
and proper recording and 
safeguarding 
of 
assets 
and 
resources; 
the 
accounting 
system 
should 
support 
the 
project’s 
requests 
for 
funding 
and 
meet 
its 
reporting 
obligations 
to 
fund 
providers 
including 
Government 
of 
Uganda, 
IDA, 
other 
donors, and 
local 
communities; 
the 
system 
should 
be 
capable 
of 
providing 
financial 
data 
to 
measure 
performance when 
linked 
to 
the 
output 
of 
the project; and 
an 
independent, 
qualified 
auditor should 
be 
appointed 
to 
review 
the 
Project’s 
financial 
statements 
and 
internal 
controls. 
(iv) 
(v) 
1.4 
The 
table 
below 
identifies 
the 
key 
risks 
that 
management 
may 
face 
in 
achieving 
these 
objectives 
and 
provides 
a 
basis 
for 
determining 
how 
management 
should 
address these 
risks.

DESCRIPTION OF 
FINANCIAL 
MANAGEMENT 
ARRANGEMENTS 
Financial 
Management 
in 
Local 
Governments 
1.5 
Section 
87 
of 
the 
Act 
sets 
out 
the 
requirement 
for 
Local 
Governments 
to 
maintain 
proper books 
of 
accounts 
and 
to 
produce 
statements 
of 
final 
accounts 
within 
four 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
the 
financial 
year. 
The 
Act 
also 
mentions 
that 
these 
accounts 
shall 
be 
audited 
by 
the 
Auditor 
General 
or 
someone 
appointed 
by 
him 
or 
her. 
The 
Auditor 
General reports 
to 
the 
Parliament, 
Line 
Ministers, 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance, 
the 
Local 
Government 
to 
which 
the 
audit 
relates, the 
Local 
Government 
Public 
Accounts 
Committee, the 
Local 
Government 
Finance Commission, the 
Inspector 
General 
of 
Government 
and 
the 
Resident 
District 
Commissioner. 
1.6 
The 
FPA 
report 
issued 
in 
June 
2002 
states 
that 
the 
financial 
management 
capacity 
of 
LGs 
has 
improved 
tremendously. 
The 
FPA 
process 
has 
acted 
as 
an 
incentive 
for 
LGs 
to 
seek 
improvements 
in 
their 
systems, 
particularly 
through 
the 
recruitment 
of 
key 
qualified 
staff 
in 
the 
key 
departments 
of 
Finance, 
Planning 
and 
Internal 
Audit. 
This 
is 
in 
addition 
to 
other processes 
that 
require 
LG 
accountability 
in 
their 
provision 
of 
services. 
The 
improvement 
is 
indicated 
by 
the 
number 
of 
Local 
Governments that have 
prepared 
and 
submitted 
for 
audit 
their 
financial 
statements 
for 
the 
year ended 
30 
June 
200 
1 
compared 
to 
the 
number 
for 
the 
period 
ended 
2000. 
Other 
government 
and 
donor supported 
initiatives 
such 
as 
the 
EFMP 
11, 
the 
Local 
Government 
Training 
Program and 
DANIDA 
support 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
final 
accounts also 
contributed 
to 
this 
trend. 
1.7 
The 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
project 
will 
require 
financial 
management mechanisms 
that 
hold 
local 
governments accountable 
for 
project 
transactions. 
The 
basis 
for 
these 
accountability 
mechanisms 
is 
laid 
down 
in 
the 
Local 
Governments 
Financial 
and 
Accounting 
Regulations, 
1998 
(LGFAR). 
These 
shall 
be 
followed 
when 
Local 
Governments account 
for 
funds 
under 
Components 
2 
and 
3 
of 
the 
project. 
1.8 
A 
Fiscal Decentralization 
Strategy (FDS) was 
developed 
by 
GoU 
after 
a 
study 
on 
fiscal 
decentralization 
in 
200 
1. 
The 
study 
reviewed 
the 
intergovernmental 
fiscal 
transfer 
systems, 
reporting 
and 
accountability 
procedures. 
In 
June 
2002, 
the 
Cabinet approved the 
piloting 
of 
the 
strategy 
in 
15 
LGs 
and 
appropriate support 
will 
be 
provided 
under 
the 
LGDP 
11. 
A 
consultancy 
has 
been 
commissioned 
to 
review local 
government 
financial 
accountability, 
to 
devise 
ways 
and 
means 
to 
further improve 
the 
financial 
management 
environment 
within 
local 
governments 
and 
to 
design 
financial 
performance 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
procedures. 
Through 
detailed 
case 
studies, 
the 
consultancy 
will 
seek 
to 
further 
enhance 
GoU’s understanding 
of 
the 
processes 
and 
institutional 
arrangements 
that 
promote or 
inhibit 
improved 
financial 
management 
and accountability 
at 
the 
local 
government 
level. 
The 
outputs 
of 
the 
consultancy 
will 
be: 
a 
set 
of 
Guidelines 
for 
FDS 
financial 
management 
and 
reporting 
accountability;  a 
manual 
on 
financial 
and performance 
management benchmarking; 
and 
a 
framework 
for 
improving 
LG 
financial 
and performance 
management. 
1.9 
In 
addition 
to 
those 
described 
above 
and 
in 
the 
following 
sections 
of 
this 
report, other 
aspects 
of 
LG 
financial 
management 
are 
as 
follows: 
(i) 
Accounting 
and bookkeeping: 
The 
Local 
Government 
Financial 
and 
Accounting 
Regulations 
state 
that 
each 
local 
government 
council 
shall maintain 
the 
following 
books 
of 
accounts: Cash 
book; Journal; 
General 
Ledger 
and subsidiary 
ledgers; 
Abstracts; 
Asset 
registers; 
and a 
Vote 
Book. 
Subsidiary 
ledgers 
will 
be 
maintained 
for 
LGDP 
I1 
transactions.  These 
and 
other 
rules 
are 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Local 
Government 
Financial 
and 
Accounting 
Regulations.

(ii) 
Public 
Accounts 
Committees: 
The 
PAC 
for 
each 
HLG 
examines 
reports 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General, 
Chief 
Internal Auditor 
and any other reports 
of 
commissions 
of 
inquiry. 
The 
PAC 
prepares 
a 
report 
and 
submits 
it 
to 
the 
Council 
and 
to 
the 
Minister 
of 
Local 
Government 
who 
lays 
the 
report 
before 
Parliament. 
It 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Council 
and 
the 
Chief 
Administrative 
Officer or 
Town 
Clerk 
to 
implement 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
PAC. 
The 
Parliamentarv 
Local 
Government Accounts Committee: 
The 
Local 
Government Accounts 
Committee 
was 
created 
by 
the Parliament 
in 
July 
2001. 
The 
committee 
examines 
the 
reports 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General 
on 
Local 
Government 
accounts. 
The Committee 
also considers the 
Auditor 
General’s 
report 
in 
relation to 
the 
Local 
Government 
Public 
Accounts Committee 
reports 
laid 
before 
Parliament 
by 
the 
Minister 
of 
Local 
Government. 
The 
Committee’s 
report 
is 
presented 
to 
Parliament 
for 
debate 
twice 
a 
year. 
The 
creation 
of 
the 
committee 
has 
strengthened the 
evaluation 
process 
of 
the 
audit 
reports.

Officer  (CFO). 
The 
CFO 
reports 
to 
the 
CAO 
for 
all 
financial 
transactions 
and accounts 
in 
the 
LG, 
including 
those 
financed 
under 
the 
project.

responsible 
for 
managing 
the 
financial 
transactions 
of 
a 
sub-county. 
In 
an 
effort 
to 
equip 
LG 
accounts 
and 
audit 
staff 
with 
up-to-date 
skills 
in 
accounting and 
financial 
management, 
many have 
been 
enrolled 
for 
a 
course sponsored 
by 
the 
MOFPED 
which 
will 
enable 
them 
to 
obtain professional 
or 
technical 
accounting qualifications. 
Planning 
and Budgeting 
1.15 
A 
project 
budget 
has 
been 
drawn 
up 
and 
is 
included 
in 
the 
PAD 
and 
the PIP. 
Project 
annual 
budgets 
will 
be drawn 
from 
the 
PIP and 
disbursement 
schedule. 
The 
annual budget 
will 
be 
prepared 
based 
on 
the 
policy 
guidelines issued 
by 
MOFPED 
Treasury 
on 
the 
fiscal 
policy 
of 
the 
government. 
The 
budget 
format 
will 
be 
based 
on 
the 
Project 
categories 
and 
sub-categories. 
1.16 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
six 
monthly 
forecasts 
will 
be 
made 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
every 
quarter 
which 
will 
form 
the 
basis 
of 
disbursements 
for 
funds 
for

laid 
down 
in 
the 
LGFAR.  National planning 
guidelines 
issued 
by 
the 
Decentralization 
Secretariat 
will 
support the 
LGs 
in 
planning 
and 
budgeting 
for 
investment 
funds 
and 
address 
inclusion 
of 
community 
plans 
in 
consolidated

plan 
in 
place, 
and 
expenditure 
under

Il 
has 
to 
be 
in 
line 
with 
council-approved 
annual plans. 
The 
disbursement 
of 
grants 
to 
LGs 
will 
be 
based 
on 
their 
workplans. 
Planning 
and

Accounting 
Systems 
and Procedures 
Financial 
Management 
Manual 
(FMM) 
1.18 
The 
accounting 
systems, 
policies 
and 
procedures 
employed 
by 
the 
PCU 
in 
accounting 
and 
managing 
for 
LGDP 
funds 
are 
documented 
in 
the 
project’s 
FMM. 
The 
FMM 
will 
be 
used 
by: 
IDA 
and 
other 
donors 
to 
assess 
the 
acceptability 
of 
the 
project 
accounting, 
reporting 
and 
control 
systems; 
staff 
as 
a 
reference manual; and 
by 
the 
auditors 
to 
assess 
project 
accounting 
systems 
and 
controls 
and 
in 
designing 
specific 
project 
audit 
procedures. 
1.19 
Specific 
procedures 
are 
documented 
for 
each 
significant 
accounting 
function. 
They 
are 
written 
to 
depict 
document and 
transaction 
flows, 
the appropriate 
filing 
of 
project 
documents, management 
approvals 
and organizational duties 
and 
responsibilities. 
The 
accounting 
system 
consists 
of 
the 
methods 
and 
records established 
to 
identify, 
assemble analyze, 
classify, 
record 
and 
report 
the 
transactions 
of 
a 
project, and 
to 
maintain accountability 
for 
the 
related 
assets 
and 
liabilities. 
The 
following 
aspects are 
covered 
in 
the 
FMM: 
Flow 
of 
Funds; 
Financial 
and 
Accounting 
Policies 
for 
the Project; 
Accounting 
System 
(including 
centers 
for 
maintenance 
of 
accounting 
records, 
Chart 
of 
Accounts, 
formats 
of 
books 
and 
records, 
accounting and 
financial 
procedures); 
Authorization 
procedures 
for 
transactions; 
Budgeting 
System; 
Financial 
Forecasting 
System; 
Procurement 
And 
Contract 
Administration 
Monitoring 
System; 
Financial 
Reporting (including 
formats 
of 
reports, 
linkages 
with 
Chart 
of 
Accounts 
and 
procedures 
for 
reviewing 
financial 
information); 
Procedures 
undertaken 
by 
MoLG 
during 
the 
Financial 
Performance 
Assessments; 
Auditing 
Arrangements; 
and 
Human 
Resource Aspects. 
In 
addition, the 
FMM 
documents 
the arrangements 
that have 
been 
made 
for 
recording 
project 
impacts, outcomes, outputs, 
and 
inputs 
that 
are 
required 
to 
assess 
progress 
toward 
the 
achievement 
of 
project 
objectives.

Accounting 
system 
1.20 
To 
maintain 
the 
efficiency, 
accuracy and 
timeliness 
of 
financial 
reporting 
and 
to 
facilitate 
management analysis 
of 
the 
financial information, 
the 
PCU 
has 
completed 
the 
installation 
of 
a software 
based 
accounting 
system 
and 
staff 
were 
fully 
trained 
in 
its 
operation. 
The 
system, 
based 
on 
Sunsystems 
software, 
has 
two 
modules: 
the 
Ledger 
Accounting 
and 
Vision 
Executive 
modules. 
1.21 
The Ledger Accounting 
module 
incorporates 
the 
general ledger, budgets, 
cashbook 
and 
bank 
reconciliation 
functions. 
The 
major 
functions 
performed 
within 
this 
module include 
journal 
processing, 
budgeting, bank reconciliation, 
financial reporting 
and 
control.  The 
module 
also enables 
the 
importing 
of 
budgets created 
using 
the 
Excel 
spreadsheet 
software. 
The 
Vision 
Executive 
module 
enables 
the 
project 
to 
automatically 
generate 
the 
FMRs 
that 
are 
required 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
IDA 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis, 
in 
addition to 
statutory 
reports. 
Other 
reports 
may 
also 
be 
configured 
by 
project 
staff 
following 
the 
training 
they 
received. 
The 
software 
also 
includes 
controls 
preventing 
the 
posting 
of 
transactions 
to 
wrong 
periods and 
limiting 
access 
only 
to 
authorized 
personnel. 
1.22 
The 
FMM 
will 
be 
updated 
to 
include 
a 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
accounting 
system 
and 
procedures. 
The 
accounting 
records 
will 
be 
kept 
up-to-date 
and 
the 
financial 
statements 
summarizing 
these 
will 
be 
presented 
for 
audit 
from 
time to 
time. 
A 
monthly 
Trial 
Balance 
will 
be 
drawn 
to 
ensure 
the 
arithmetical 
accuracy 
of 
the 
postings 
and 
balances 
with 
books 
of 
account. 
A 
bank reconciliation 
report 
will 
be 
prepared 
for 
the 
individual 
bank 
accounts 
and the 
balances 
reconciled 
with 
the 
Statement 
of 
Accounts 
received 
from 
the 
bank. 
While 
monthly 
and 
quarterly 
accounts 
and reports 
will 
be 
compiled 
on 
cash 
basis, 
the 
semi-annual and annual accounts 
will 
take 
into 
account 
accrued expenditure. 
The 
annual 
accounts 
will 
also 
include 
a 
schedule 
of 
commitments 
made. 
Project 
Chart 
of 
Accounts 
1.23 
A 
Chart 
of 
Accounts 
already 
exists 
for 
LGDP 
I 
that 
allows 
project 
costs 
to 
be 
directly 
related 
to 
specific 
work 
activities 
and 
outputs 
of 
the 
project. 
It 
will 
be 
amended 
to 
enable data 
to 
be 
captured 
and 
classified 
by 
budget 
heads, 
project 
components, 
expenditure 
categories, 
and 
disbursement categories. 
1.24 
Each 
accounting transaction 
bears 
an 
account code 
indicating 
the 
category 
under 
which 
it 
is 
financed, 
the 
component 
or 
activity 
under 
which 
it 
is 
classified 
and 
the 
type 
of 
transaction. 
These 
codes 
are 
listed 
in 
the 
Chart 
of 
Accounts. 
The overall 
form 
of 
account 
codes 
is: 
A-BBB-CCCC 
where: 
A 
represents 
the 
Financing 
Category 
reflected 
in 
the 
Development 
Financing 
Agreement; 
BBB 
represents 
the 
component/activity(and 
Sub-component 
or 
sub-activity 
where 
applicable), 
as 
reflected 
in 
the 
PIP; 
CCCC 
reflects 
the 
transaction 
type, 
i.e. 
whether 
it 
is 
an 
asset, 
liability, 
expense, 
or 
income, and 
the 
transaction description. 
The 
structure 
of 
accounting 
codes 
will 
thus 
enable the 
reporting 
of 
the 
project 
transactions 
to 
be 
analyzed 
between 
Financing 
categories and 
between 
Project 
components. 
Financial 
Reporting 
1.25 
Formats 
of 
the 
various 
periodic 
financial 
reports 
to 
be 
generated 
from 
the 
financial 
management 
system 
will 
be 
developed. 
There 
will 
be 
clear 
linkages 
between 
the 
information 
in 
these 
reports 
and 
the 
Chart 
of 
Accounts. 
The financial 
reports 
will 
be 
designed 
to 
provide quality 
and 
timely 
information 
to 
project 
management, 
implementing 
agencies, 
and 
various 
stakeholders 
on 
project 
performance. 
1.26 
These 
reports 
include 
financial 
statements 
(e.g. 
sources 
and 
application 
of 
funds; 
expenditure

and comparison 
with 
budgets; 
short-term forecasts 
of 
expenditure; 
unit 
costs 
for 
key 
items 
and 
comparison 
with 
budgets; 
etc.). 
The 
reports 
will 
closely 
follow 
sample 
formats that 
are 
indicated 
in 
the 
Guidelines 
for 
Borrowers 
on 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports.

formats 
of 
these

will 
be 
developed 
in 
accordance 
with 
IDA 
requirements 
prior 
to 
project 
implementation. 
Annual 
Financial 
Statements 
and 
Annexes 
for 
the 
project 
will 
include: 
a Statement 
of

and 
1.29 
For 
LGs, 
the 
LGFAR 
require every 
local 
government 
to 
produce 
statements 
of 
final 
accounts 
within 
four 
months 
from 
the 
end 
of 
each 
financial 
year 
and 
provides 
formats 
and 
schedules 
to 
guide 
the 
preparation 
of 
these 
accounts. 
LG 
expenditures 
financed 
using 
grants 
provided 
under 
components 2 
and 
3 
will 
be 
reflected 
in 
these 
financial 
statements. 
The 
Chief 
Administrative 
Officer 
is 
required 
to 
submit 
the 
accounts 
to 
the 
Auditor 
General. 
The 
Local 
Governments 
Act 
further 
requires that 
in 
addition 
to 
normal 
Government 
Accounting 
requirements, 
separate 
reports 
shall 
be 
made 
and 
submitted 
to 
donors 
to 
account 
for 
donor 
funds 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
relevant 
agreements. 
For 
each quarter, 
consolidated 
quarterly 
financial 
reports 
will 
be 
prepared 
by 
each 
HLG. 
These 
will 
consolidate 
the 
accounts 
for 
the 
LLGs 
within 
their 
area 
of 
jurisdiction 
and their 
submission 
to 
the 
MOLG 
will 
be 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
release 
of 
quarterly 
disbursements 
to 
the 
LGs. 
2. 
Audit 
Arrangements 
Internal 
Auditing 
2.1 
The 
project 
is 
subject 
to 
statutory 
internal 
audit 
regulations 
through 
which 
the 
internal 
audit 
function 
is 
provided 
by 
the 
MoFPED 
(Treasury 
Department). 
However, 
the 
performance 
of 
this 
function 
is 
currently 
only 
limited 
to 
the 
pre-audit 
inspection 
of 
the 
project’s 
transactions due 
to 
the 
availability 
of 
appropriate 
staff 
resources. 
No 
internal 
audit reviews 
are 
undertaken 
to 
ensure, 
for 
instance, that 
the 
management 
complies 
with 
internal 
controls. 
In 
addition to 
the 
pre-audit 
checks 
currently 
conducted 
by 
the 
MOLG 
Internal Auditor, 
inspectors 
from 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
Planning and Economic 
Development conduct 
reviews aimed 
at 
ensuring that expenditures 
are 
made 
in 
accordance 
with 
Government regulations. 
2.2 
For 
LGs, 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
Internal 
Audit 
Department 
is 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
Local 
Government 
Act 
and 
the 
responsibilities 
are 
set 
out 
in 
S 
91. 
The 
Chief 
Internal 
Auditor 
of 
a 
local 
government 
reports 
directly to 
the 
local 
council 
on 
whether the 
systems 
and operations 
of 
the 
local 
- 
60 
- 
Page  65
administration 
are 
efficient, 
effective, economical, free 
from 
fraud 
and other malpractices, 
and whether 
they 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
LGFAR. 
His 
duties and functions 
include 
general audits, 
value 
for 
money reviews 
and 
special 
investigations 
when 
called 
upon 
and 
where 
the 
Auditor 
General 
is 
unable 
to 
do 
so. 
The Internal 
Audit 
Manual 
issued 
in 
January 
2000 includes 
guidance 
on 
the 
objectives 
and 
procedures 
of 
internal 
audit 
engagements 
in 
local 
governments. 
Appropriate reliance 
shall 
be placed 
on 
these 
arrangements 
with 
respect 
to 
grants 
disbursed under 
Components 
2 
and 
3. 
2.3 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
with 
new 
Government 
Financial 
Regulations 
to 
be 
issued 
under 
the 
forthcoming 
Public 
Finance and 
Accountability 
Act, the 
MOFPED 
will 
be 
charged 
with 
ensuring 
that the 
internal 
audit 
function 
in 
each Government 
Ministry 
is 
appropriate 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
that 
Ministry. 
They 
may 
issue 
instructions 
to 
other 
Ministries 
in 
the discharge 
of 
this 
responsibility 
and 
to 
ensure 
that the 
status 
and 
powers 
of 
the 
internal 
audit 
function 
in 
each 
conforms 
to 
internationally 
accepted standards. 
The 
Permanent Secretary 
in 
the 
MoLG 
will 
be 
required 
to 
establish and 
maintain 
an 
effective internal 
audit 
function 
which 
shall 
be 
responsible 
to 
him 
or 
her 
for 
the appraisal 
of 
the 
soundness 
and application 
of 
accounting, 
financial 
and 
operational controls 
and 
the 
review 
of 
operations 
or 
programmes 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
results 
are 
consistent 
with 
established 
objectives 
and 
goals 
and 
whether 
the operations 
or 
programmes 
are 
being 
carried out 
as 
planned. 
Other 
duties 
of 
internal 
audit 
function 
include 
the 
review 
and 
reporting 
on: 
proper control 
over 
all 
financial 
resources 
of 
the 
unit; 
conformity 
with 
financial 
and 
operational 
procedures 
laid 
down 
in 
any 
legislation 
and 
good 
accounting practice; 
and 
the 
reliability 
and 
integrity 
of 
financial 
and 
operating 
data. 
2.4 
To 
expand 
the 
currently 
limited 
scope 
of 
its 
internal 
audit function, 
the 
MoLG 
should 
therefore 
prepare 
a 
document 
setting 
out 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
Ministry 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
expected duties, 
including 
those 
related 
to 
the project, and 
the 
staffing 
resources 
required 
for 
those 
duties. 
The 
frequency 
and extent 
of 
internal 
audit reviews 
and 
testing 
of 
the 
internal 
controls should 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
nature, 
complexity, 
and 
risk 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
activities. 
These 
requirements 
will 
be 
agreed 
between 
MoFPED 
and 
MoLG, 
after 
which 
the 
necessary 
staffing 
resources 
will 
be 
committed 
to 
fulfilling 
the 
agreed 
Terms 
of 
Reference. 
These 
should 
ensure 
that 
the

Although 
the 
requirement 
for 
the 
Auditor 
General 
to 
audit 
the 
financial 
statements 
of 
Local 
Governments 
including 
LLGs 
is 
stipulated 
in 
the Constitution, 
the 
Office 
of 
Auditor 
General 
has 
in 
the 
past 
suffered 
significant 
capacity 
weaknesses 
that have prevented 
this 
constitutional 
requirement 
and 
mandate 
to 
be 
fulfilled, particularly 
in 
the 
case 
of 
LLGs. 
The project 
will 
therefore 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
OAG 
over 
a 
period 
of 
three 
years 
to 
enable 
the audits 
of 
the 
financial

of 
LLGs 
to 
commence. 
The 
Office 
of 
the 
Auditor 
General 
will 
prepare an

2003. 
The

of 
the 
approach, 
through 
which 
the requirement 
to 
audit

will 
be 
satisfied, 
will

satisfy 
the 
Bank’s 
minimum 
requirements 
under 
OP/BP10.02 
and 
are 
adequate 
to 
provide, 
with 
reasonable

accurate 
and 
timely 
information 
on 
the 
status 
of 
the 
project 
required 
by 
IDA. 
Satisfactory 
steps 
have also 
been taken 
to 
mitigate 
risks 
arising 
from 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
local

Assessment 
of 
Financial 
Performance 
of 
LGs 
3.18 
The 
MoLG 
will 
perform 
a 
Financial 
Performance 
Assessment 
(FPA) 
of 
LGs 
in 
August/September 
each year. 
A 
satisfactory 
FPA 
for 
each 
year 
will 
be 
a prerequisite 
for 
qualification 
of 
LGs 
to 
receive 
grants 
in 
the 
period following 
the 
one 
in 
which 
the 
FPA 
is 
carried 
out. 
The 
assessment 
will 
involve: 
(i) 
determination 
of 
whether 
there 
is 
continuing sufficient 
accounting capacity 
in 
the 
local 
governments; 
(ii) 
verification 
of 
expenditures 
using 
relevant supporting 
documentation; 
(iii) 
physical 
inspection 
of 
investments;(iv) 
a 
review 
of 
the 
status 
of 
audits 
of 
local 
govemments 
in 
the 
project; 
(v) 
a 
review 
of 
cashflow 
forecasts; 
(vi) 
a 
review 
of 
reports 
of 
transfers 
of 
funds 
from 
the 
Government’s 
Consolidated 
Fund 
to 
the 
Local 
Governments; 
and 
(vii) 
compliance 
by 
local 
governments 
with 
project 
objectives. 
The 
procedures 
undertaken 
during 
such 
assessments 
are documented 
in 
a 
FPA 
Procedures 
Manual. 
Suspension 
of 
disbursements 
3.19 
IDA 
will 
have 
the 
right, 
as 
reflected 
in 
the Development 
Financing 
Agreement, 
to 
suspend 
disbursement 
of 
funds 
if 
reporting 
requirements 
are 
not 
complied

RE: 
LETTER 
Of 
SECTOR 
POLICY 
ON 
FISCAL 
DEVOLUTION 
AND 
LOCAL 
GOVERNMENTS' 
CAPACITY 
BUILDING. 
1. 
I 
am 
writing 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Govemment 
of 
the Republic 
of 
Uganda 
to 
request 
US$125m 
for 
implementation 
of 
key 
priority activities 
under 
the 
second phase 
of 
Local 
Government 
Development 
Programme (LGDPII). 
This 
letter 
outlines 
our 
policy on 
the 
devolution 
of 
development 
funds 
to 
Local 
Governments 
(CGs) 
and 
the 
strategy for 
building 
the 
capacities 
of 
LGs for improved service 
delivery, 
accountability 
and 
transparency 
to 
the 
population. 
The 
letter 
also 
describes 
the 
ongoing 
initiatives, 
major policy 
reforms, 
and 
the 
actions 
that 
Government 
will undenake 
to 
implement 
these measures through 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
II. 
Background 
2. 
Uganda's strategy 
for 
economic 
transformation 
is 
spelt 
out in 
the 
Poverty 
Eradication 
Action 
Plan 
(PEAP), 
a 
medium-term 
development plan that 
guides 
Govemment 
Policy 
and 
provides 
a 
framework 
for 
detailed 
sector 
and 
Local 
Govemment 
plans. 
The 
PEAP 
was 
first introduced in 
1997 
after 
18 
months 
of 
consultation 
with 
stakeholders. 
It 
was 
revised in 
eariy 
2000 
and 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
revised 
PEAP 
was 
presented 
as 
Uganda's Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) 
to 
the 
Boards 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
the 
International 
Monitory 
Fund 
(IMF) 
in 
May 
2000. 
The 
PRSP 
focuses 
on 
four 
key pillars: 
d) 
creating 
an 
enabling 
environment 
for economic 
growth and 
structural 
transformation; 
2) 
ensuring 
good 
govemance 
and 
security, 
including 
improvement 
in 
public 
service 
delivery and 
decentraiisation; 
3) 
increasing the 
ability 
of 
the poor 
to 
raise their 
incomes: 
and 
4) 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
the 
poor. 
1 
Page  82
3. 
Decentralisation 
policy  is  a 
cornerstone  of 
Government‘s 
strategy 
for 
economic 
transformation. 
The 
policy focuses 
on 
the 
devolution 
of power 
and 
functions 
within 
the 
planning, 
management 
and  delivery 
of 
basic 
services 
by 
Local Governments. The 
policy, 
which was announced in 1992, 
is 
enshrined 
in the 
Constitution 
and 
has 
a detailed 
legal 
framework for its 
implementation 
provided for 
in 
the 
Local 
Governments Act 
of  1997. 
This 
policy was 
further elaborated 
on 
in 
the 
“Letter 
of 
Sector Policy 
on 
Fiscal 
Devolution, 
Control and 
Management 
of 
Public’ 
Expenditure” of 
October 
1999 
which 
was a joint letter for 
both 
the 
EFMP 
II 
and 
LGDP 
I 
projects. 
4. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
LGs play key roles 
in the 
implementation of the 
Government’s 
PEAP/PRSP, 
in 
such areas 
as primary education, primary 
health 
care, 
water and sanitation, 
feeder 
roads and agricultural 
extension. 
These 
sectors 
are key 
to 
improving the 
living 
conditions of our 
population. 
Thus, the evolving relationships 
between 
Central 
and 
LGs, is crucial 
to the 
success 
of Government’s 
strategy. These 
relationships include, 
inter 
alia, 
fiscal 
and 
institutional capacity 
dime.nsions. 
Also 
of 
vital concern for the 
strategy 
is 
downward accountability 
at 
the local level, 
based 
on 
transparent 
and 
highly 
participatory decision 
making and 
monitoring 
of 
implementation 
of 
programmes. 
- 
5. 
The 
LGDP 
implementation will 
further enhance 
the efforts 
of the GoU 
in 
the 
implementation of 
the 
decentralization policy where 
there  is 
a  need 
to 
address 
the 
apparent 
tension 
between the requirement 
to 
achieve national 
sectoral targets  and 
the 
drive 
towards 
identifying 
local 
priorities. 
This 
apparent tension 
can  be 
resolved by ensuring 
that  local 
prioritisation is 
recognized 
through 
the 
consultative 
process. 
Local 
prioritisation 
can 
then 
be 
integrated 
into  national  targets 
and 
the 
activities  can 
be 
properly 
sequenced 
to facilitate 
both 
ownership at 
local level and achievable targets 
at 
the national level. 
It 
is 
important to acknowledge 
that 
an effective two- 
way dialogue 
must continue 
to be 
developed 
between local communities, 
local 
governments 
and central 
government. 
This will enable communities 
to 
develop 
their  own  projects 
and 
to 
participate  fully 
in 
the 
relevant 
activities. 
While the country, as a 
whole 
will 
be 
better placed 
to 
define and 
achieve its objectives 
and  to 
measure progress, 
the 
Local Government 
Development 
programmes  are 
playing 
a  prominent role 
in 
these  crucial 
developments. 
6. 
The 
on-going 
Local 
Government  Development  Programme 
(LGDPI), 
became effective 
in 
October 
2000 
and 
is 
scheduled 
to be 
completed 
in 
June 
2004. 
This  Programme  supports  the 
dovernment’s 
PRSP. 
The 
LGDPI 
was 
designed 
as 
a pilot project with the objective 
to: 
(a) 
test 
the 
feasibility 
of 
implementing Constitutional and legal mandates 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
decentralised 
services 
and 
devolution

(b)

capacity 
of the 
Ministry 
of  Local Government, the  Local 
Government  Finance 
Commission 
(LGFC)

project 
implementation  for  documenting 
experiences 
and 
good  practices for 
formulating appropriate strategy for 
scaling 
country 
wide. 
7. 
The 
basic 
feature 
of 
the 
LGDP 
is 
its 
unique 
link 
between 
the 
decentralisation of 
development budget, 
capacity building 
support 
and 
a 
clearly  defined 
performance 
assessment 
system  with 
strong 
in-build 
incentives 
for 
Local 
Governments  (LGs). 
In 
order 
to 
enhance 
the 
- 
performance 
of 
LGs 
in 
implementing 
their 
Constitutional 
and 
legal 
mandates for decentralised 
service 
provision one of the 
main 
pillars 
of 
the 
LGDP 
I 
is 
the 
incentive 
system. 
The incentive system 
rewards good 
LGs 
performance 
and 
sanctions poor 
performance. Poor performing LGs are 
supported through 
the 
capacity 
building grant 
to 
improve their performance, 
Finally,  LGDP 
is 
based  on  the 
principles  of  participatory  planning, 
involvement  of  all  levels  of 
LGs 
in 
the  decision-making 
and 
service 
provision, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
creation 
of  ownership and sustainability 
of 
the 
investments. 
8. 
The 
Mid-Term Review of the 
LGDP-I 
was conducted 
in 
February 
2002. 
The 
review concluded that 
the  Programme 
was 
on’course 
and 
achieving its 
objectives. 
The, 
programme 
provided 
funds 
for 
service 
provision 
in 
key 
PEAP areas 
and 
valuable 
experiences 
in 
the field 
of 
fiscal decentralisation. 
The  review  recommended the 
LGDP 
I 
model, 
to 
become  the  national 
system 
for 
transfers of 
development 
grants to LGs 
over 
the medium term. 
The 
Review  also  highlighted 
a 
number 
of 
,areas 
that  need  further 
refinement, especially 
in 
order 
to make 
the 
programme more sustainable 
in 
respect 
of 
service provision, 
good 
governance and promoting 
the 
efficiency 
in 
the .utilisation 
of 
the capacity building grant. 
9. 
In 
a 
related  development,  Government  undertook 
a 
study 
on 
fiscal 
decentralisation 
in 
2001, 
which 
reviewed  the  inter-governmental fiscal 
transfer systems, reporting 
and 
accountability procedures. 
The 
findings of 
the 
study 
formed 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
development 
of 
its 
Fiscal 
Decentralisation Strategy 
(FDS), 
which was  approved by Government in 
June 
2002. 
Through 
the 
FDS, 
the Government 
has made 
a 
strategic choice 
to 
mainstream 
the 
LGDP modalities and guide the development component 
of 
the inter-governmental fiscal transfers. 
The 
flexibility under FDS, enables 
greater 
local 
governments’  autonomy 
in 
the 
decentralisation 
of 
public 
service delivery and downward accountability. 
10. 
The 
LGDP-II 
will 
directly support 
the 
Government’s Fiscal Decentralisation 
Strategic choice and incorporate the lessons learned under 
LGDPI 
with 
a 
view to  improving delivery of basic services  and engendering economic 
growth 
and 
poverty reduction 
in 
line with the Government’s PEAPlPRSC

and decentralisation 
policy. 
The Programme 
will also 
incorporate lessons 
learned from bilateral 
donor 
programmes, 
implemented 
since 
the 
start of 
the  LGDP 
I 
in 
October 
2000. 
The Programme will 
support 
the 
FDS and 
serve 
as 
“bridge” 
operation 
in 
preparation 
for 
broader  support 
to 
Government’s 
decentralisation 
policy through a 
future 
budget support 
to 
decentralisation. 
11. 
Donors  are 
increasingly 
supportive 
of 
the 
LGDP 
modality 
and 
are 
demonstrating 
willingness 
to 
foster  efforts 
to 
establish  a  predictable, 
transparent and 
sustainable 
intergovernmental fiscal transfer system and a 
LGs 
capacity building 
strategy 
that 
is 
consistent 
with: 
(a) 
the 
overall 
policy 
framework 
as 
set out by Central Government; 
- 
(b) 
the 
legal 
mandates 
for Local Governments’ 
service delivery; 
(c) 
a significant 
local 
revenue base 
that 
is 
effectively 
mobilised; 
and 
(d) 
an 
overall 
hard 
budget constraint 
on 
fiscal transfers that 
is 
consistent 
with sound 
macro 
fundamentals. 
12. 
I 
now wish 
to 
outline 
the 
guiding principles 
of 
the policy framework 
in 
which 
the full decentralization of 
the 
development 
resources 
and capacity building 
for LGs 
will 
occur. 
I 
also 
give 
details about the 
expected 
contribution 
of 
the 
LGDP 
II 
to 
the 
realization of 
this policy 
framework. 
Govern 
men t’s Fisca 
I 
Policy 
13. 
The 
Government’s fiscal  policy  continues  to 
be 
guided 
by 
three  main 
objectives  namely: 
a) 
maintaining  macroeconomic 
stability 
by  matching 
public  expenditure 
with 
available 
resources; 
b) 
allocating  additional 
resources 
to 
PEAP 
areas 
for 
poverty 
reduction; 
and 
c) 
reducing 
dependence on 
external 
resources through 
increasing 
the revenue base 
in 
a sustainable manner without causing distortions 
in 
taxes. These objectives 
are intended 
to 
gradually 
reduce 
the 
overall fiscal deficit 
in 
relation 
to 
Gross 
Domestic Product 
(GDP), 
which is consistent with the objective of Pillar 
1 
of 
the 
PEAP, 
namely 
Economic  Growth  and  Structural  Transformation. 
Government will 
therefore 
continue 
to place 
emphasis 
on 
efficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
its 
resources 
with 
emphasis 
on 
Good 
Governance 
as 
a pre-requisite 
for effective poverty reduction efforts. 
Decentralisation Principles 
and 
Objectives 
14. 
The  Ugandan 
decentralisation 
policy 
is 
based 
on  the  principles  of: 
devolution 
of 
powers, 
functions 
and 
service 
to 
all  levels 
of 
Local 
Government; enhancing 
good 
governance and democratic participation 
to 
enrich 
the 
decision  making  process;  provision 
of 
suitable  structures 
throughout 
government; 
and 
recognition  of  a  hard  budget  constraint. 
These  principles  have 
been 
provided  for 
in 
the  1995 Constitution 
and 
further elaborated in the 
Local 
Governments 
Act, 
1997. 
The key 
to 
these 
4 
Page  85
principles 
is 
the 
autonomy 
in 
service 
delivery 
which 
has 
been 
devolved 
to 
LGs  while 
the 
centre 
retains  the 
responsibility 
for 
national 
policy 
formulation, setting standards, 
supervision, 
offering 
technical 
advice and 
guidance, 
providing 
support 
supervision  and 
determining 
the 
national 
medium term 
budget 
and expenditure 
frameworks. 
These 
principles have 
changed 
the 
relationship  between 
central  and 
local 
government  and 
between 
the 
different levels within local 
government. 
Fiscal 
Decentralisation. 
15. 
The 
objective 
of 
Fiscal Decentralisation 
Strategy 
(FDS) 
is to 
streamline 
the 
resource  transfer  modalities 
to 
LGs  without 
constraining 
the 
effective 
service delivery functions 
that 
were devolved 
to- 
them  under 
the 
LGs 
Act 
1997. The Constitution provides for three 
types of 
grants 
to be 
transferred 
- 
to 
LGs namely: 
Unconditional Grant, 
Conditional 
Grant  and  Equalisation 
Grant. This is in addition 
to 
powers 
devolved 
to LGs 
to 
levy, 
charge, 
collect 
and appropriate fees and 
taxes 
in 
accordance 
wifh 
the 
law. 
The 
drafting 
of 
the 
LGs (rating) Bill, 
2003, 
which is 
soon 
to 
become 
law, 
is 
a demonstration 
of 
Government’s commitment 
to 
improve revenue 
performance 
in 
LGs. This 
further strengthens 
the 
provisions 
in 
the 
Constitution 
and 
the 
LGs 
Act 
1997 
and underscore Government’s 
commitment 
to the implementation of 
FDS. 
On 
going 
initiatives linked 
to 
LGDP 
II 
16. 
There 
are 
a  number of  donor-funded 
initiatives 
linked 
to 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
II. 
Brief 
overviews 
of 
those 
initiatives 
are 
given 
here 
below. 
a) 
Decentralisation 
Support 
Programme 
(DSP) 
by 
DflD 
17. 
The 
DSP 
aims  at  strengthening 
key 
Central  Government  institutions 
(Ministry 
of 
Local 
Government 
-MoLG, 
Local 
Government 
Finance 
Commission 
-LGFC, 
and  Uganda 
Local 
Authorities Association 
-ULAA) 
with the objective of enhancing their 
capacity, 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
. 
to 
implement  the  Government’s 
decentralisation 
policy. 
The 
DSP 
is 
designed 
to 
implement 
and 
reinforce  the 
objectives, 
instruments  and 
modalities  of 
LGDP 
I 
and  is 
managed 
through 
the  same 
institutional 
arrangements. Co-ordination and 
synergy between 
DSP and 
LGDP 
I 
have 
been 
handled through 
the 
utilisation 
of 
the 
same 
implementation institutions 
such as the Programme Steering 
Committee (PSC), 
Programme 
Technical 
Committee 
(PTC), 
Programme 
Management 
Unit  (PMU) 
as 
well  as 
streamlining 
systems 
for 
financial 
accounting, 
reporting 
and 
disbursement. 
The 
DSP support 
to 
MoLG 
and 
LGFC 
has 
been articulated 
through 
a four 
year 
LGDP 
I 
(Component 
I) 
whose implementation 
is 
due 
to 
come 
to 
an 
end 
in 
2004. 
DflD is in broad 
agreement 
with 
the 
design 
of LGDP 
I1 
and 
has 
indicated that DSP will 
be 
extended to address 
the 
gaps 
in 
capacity 
within the MoLG 
after 
its 
current phase. 
Government 
recognises that most 
of 
the 
DflD’s support 
is 
provided 
in 
form 
of 
general 
budget 
support and 
therefore  requests 
DflD 
to 
continue with  this  instrument. 
The 
DflD 
will 
therefore  not 
co-fund 
LGDP 
II 
but 
shall  provide 
parallel 
funding 
to 
complement 
LGDP 
II 
through 
the 
DSP.

Support 
to 
Local Development 
and 
Decentralisation 
by 
DANIDA 
Under 
its 
phase 
I, 
DANIDA supported the 
Decentralisation Secretariat as 
well as establishing 
the 
legislative framework 
for 
decentralisation. Under 
phase 
11, 
it 
supported 
the 
development 
of 
the wider institutional framework 
with 
support 
to 
MoLG, 
LGFC, 
ULAA, 
Urban 
Authorities 
Association 
of 
Uganda (UAAU) and 
the 
office 
of 
the Auditor General. 
The 
current 
phase 
111, 
Support 
to 
Local Development 
and 
Decentralisation, 
is 
focused 
on 
capacity 
building for improved 
governance 
and 
further 
strengthening 
of the 
institutional framework. 
Given 
the 
need 
for synergy, 
DANIDA 
support to 
capacity building will 
be 
an 
integral 
part of 
the LGDP 
11. 
To 
this effect 
DANIDA 
has 
pledged 
to finance 
Component 
3 
of 
LGDP 
ll 
- 
LGs 
Capacity 
Building.  Out 
of 
the  proposed 
three 
sub-components 
of 
Capacity 
Building under 
LGDP 
11, 
DANIDA 
has 
pledged to 
fully finance 
the 
following 
two 
sub-components: 
a) 
The 
National  LG 
Capacity  Building 
Strategy  and  the 
M 
& 
E, 
and 
b)  Strengthening 
the 
Human  Resource 
Development 
(HRD) 
functions 
in 
LGs. 
DANIDA 
shall 
also  contribute 
funding 
to 
the 
LGDP 
II 
basket 
as 
co-financier 
fqr 
sub-component 
three for 
the 
LGs 
capacity  building 
grant. 
The  implementation 
of 
the 
start 
up 
activities 
is 
already well 
underway, 
and 
DANIDA 
has 
provided 
technical 
assistance to 
work 
with 
the 
MoLG 
beginning October 
2002. 
- 
c) 
Strengthening Decentralisation 
in 
Uganda (SDU) 
by 
USAID 
20. 
The 
goal 
of the 
SDU 
is 
to ,build capacity 
in order 
to 
foster 
democratic 
principles 
in 
Uganda 
through 
the 
process 
of 
establishing 
productive 
partnerships between 
LGs 
and 
civil 
society. 
The 
SDU 
is a 
pilot project 
covering 
only 
six 
Districts: 
Luwero, 
Apac, Tororo, 
Mbarara, 
Kabale 
and 
Nakasongola. The 
project’s 
focus 
is on 
capacity 
building 
of 
elected 
and 
appointed officials 
together 
with 
representatives 
of 
civil 
society. It intends 
to 
achieve 
a more 
transparent, effective 
and 
accountable 
LGs 
system. 
The 
project  components  and 
capacity 
building 
effort  focus 
on 
financial 
management 
and 
budgeting, 
governance and 
the operations 
of 
civil society 
with  gender  mainstreaming. 
Given 
technical 
difficulties, 
USAID 
cannot 
provide 
basket 
funding 
to 
LGDP 
II. 
The 
SDU 
is, 
however, 
complementing 
LGDP 
activities by providing technical assistance 
within the 
six 
supported 
LGs, 
in an 
event 
of failure 
to 
access 
the 
Locql Development Grants, 
by 
assisting 
them to 
develop  requisite capacity 
to 
access 
the 
grant 
in the 
following financial 
year. 
d) 
Direct District Support Programmes (DDSP) by  Netherlands, Ireland 
Aid, Austria and Belgium. 
21. 
There are 
a 
number 
of 
Districts that presently 
benefit from 
direct 
bilateral 
District  Support  Programmes  that 
often  include  technical 
assistance, 
project financing, 
and 
or 
capacity building. 
It 
is 
important to 
note 
that most 
of 
the donors 
in 
this 
group 
have 
indicated willingness 
to 
mainstream 
their 
District programmes 
into the 
LGDP 
II. 
These include the 
Royal Netherlands 
Embassy 
(RNE), 
Irish 
Aid, 
and 
Austria. 
While  Belgium will 
continue 
to 
6 
Page  87
provide direct support 
to 
specific 
areas, 
it 
has indicated 
willingness 
to co- 
ordinate closely with the 
capacity 
building activities under 
LGDP 
11. 
Several 
of 
the 
donors such 
as 
the 
RNE, 
DANIDA, and 
Ireland Aid 
who 
are 
expected 
to 
join  the 
LGDP 
II, 
will  continue 
to  provide technical 
assistance 
to 
a 
number 
of 
Districts, 
hence 
supplementing  the 
more  generic 
capacity 
building 
support 
to be 
provided under LGDP 
11. 
e) 
22. 
The 
Micro Projects 
Programme 
(MPP) 
by 
the 
European 
Union 
Under 
the 
6th, 
7th, 
and 
8'h 
MPP 
20 
Districts were 
supported 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
enabling 
them 
improve 
access and use 
of 
social 
infrastructure. 
A 
capacity  building 
component was 
provided to 
address 
specific 
gaps 
related 
to  the 
establishment,  operations 
and  maintenance 
of  social 
infrastructure  created. 
The 
programme 
review 
held 
in 
March 
2002 
- 
recommended 
that 
the 
programme 
should  orient 
itself 
to 
more 
generic 
capacity 
issues 
and 
to 
involve 
LGs 
more increasingly 
in 
procurement 
of 
the 
service 
providers 
so 
as 
to 
build 
their 
capacities  as 
opposed 
to 
the 
centralistic approach, 
which 
was 
hitherto being used 
by 
the programme. 
The 
EU 
has fielded a 
mission 
in 
November 
2002 
to formulate the 
gth 
MPP 
taking  into  consideration  Government  policy 
on 
decentralisation, 
fiscal 
decentralisation 
and 
the 
on-going design 
of 
LGDP 
II. 
The 
final decision 
regarding 
this 
EU 
support 
shall be 
clarified 
after 
final 
decision 
has 
been 
made 
between 
EU, 
MoFPED, 
and 
MoLG after 
the 
three institutions 
have 
studied 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
formulation 
t,eam. 
fl 
Capacity  Building 
Programme 
for 
Decentralisation 
by 
Makerere 
University. 
23. 
Makerere University initiated research 
to 
assess the 
changing 
needs 
in 
Districts 
given  the 
new 
mandate 
of 
service 
delivery 
as 
defined 
in  the 
decentralisation policy. 
The 
research 
findings 
clearly indicated 
that for 
the 
Local  Governments' to  perform their 
new 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
for 
effective 
and efficient 
service 
delivery 
they 
require specific skills which 
are 
not  wholly 
provided 
within 
existing  University  curricula 
and 
outreach 
activities. 
In 
response 
to these findings, Makerere University through 
a 
joint 
committee comprising representatives 
of 
Government and 
the 
University 
developed 
a proposal 
to align training 
of 
students with 
current 
realities. 
Rockfeller 
Foundation 
and 
the 
World 
Bank 
have agreed 
to 
finance 
the 
initiative. 
The 
programme 
is now 
underway 
on 
a 
pilot basis 
in 
5 
Districts 
and 
is  being 
managed by 
the 
University. The 
programme 
will 
support 
LGDP 
I1 
by having 
a 
strong 
supply 
of training 
providers for 
capacity 
building 
under component 
3. 
g) 
Second 
District 
Development Programme (DDP Ir) 
by 
UNCDF. 
24. 
The 
DDP 
II 
is a 
follow-up to 
DDP 
I, 
which 
was 
a 
precursor 
to 
LGDP 
I. 
The 
project  (DDPII) 
is 
being executed  by 
the 
MoLG 
and  co-financed 
by  a 
number 
of donors 
including 
UNCDF, 
DANIDA, 
DFID 
and Japan 
Trust 
Fund. 
While the 
outcomes 
of DDPl 
guided 
the 
design/formulation principles 
for 
LGDPI, 
the  DDPII 
focuses 
on 
specific 
issues that 
emerged and 
are 
not 
7 
Page  88
addressed under 
LGDPII. 
The 
project 
is 
being 
piloted 
in 
eight Districts. 
The 
programme 
focus 
is 
participatory  planning 
and 
budgeting, 
gender 
mainstreaming 
as 
well 
as 
strengthening 
LGs’ 
administration 
of 
justice. 
The 
programme has 
a strong 
link with LGDP 
II 
through 
its components, and 
also  focuses 
on 
Local 
Revenue 
Enhancement, 
which 
is 
linked 
to 
Component 
4 
of 
LGDP 
II. 
The end target 
is 
to 
mainstream 
the 
findings 
of 
LGDPll and 
DDPII into 
a 
harmonised 
decentralisation 
framework. 
h) 
Second 
Economic  and  Financial  Management Project 
(EFMP 
11) 
by 
World 
Bank. 
25. 
The 
EFMP 
II 
was 
designed 
to 
improve the  effectiveness 
of 
the 
public 
expenditure 
management 
processes 
through 
central 
and 
local 
governments 
with 
specific 
focus 
on 
strengthening 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the  Central and 
LGs 
planning, 
budgeting and  financial 
management 
processes. 
The 
EFMP 
II 
places 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
a) 
developing 
the 
human 
resource  capacities 
in 
the  areas  of  planning, 
budgeting, accounting and auditing; b) 
implementing 
an 
appropriate legal 
and  regulatory 
framework 
and  institutionalising  computerised  financial 
management 
systems 
as 
a 
basis 
of 
improving 
fiscal 
and financial reporting. 
While 
there exists training under 
EFMP 
II, 
the 
training 
covers professional 
development  aspects as well 
as 
specific financial management  system 
skills. 
It 
will  therefore 
be 
complemented by the training under LGDP 
II, 
which  shall 
be 
based 
on  specific  capacity 
needs 
demanded 
by 
local 
governments.  The  training  under  LGDP 
II 
is 
also 
intended 
to 
provide 
opportunities 
to 
local governments 
to 
develop 
generic 
skills training. 
i) 
Financial 
Accountability Programme 
(FAP) 
by 
DflD. 
26. 
The 
objective 
of 
FAP 
is to 
improve accountability 
and 
transparency 
in 
the 
financial 
management 
process 
and 
to 
reduce 
and 
eventually 
the 
opportunities for corruption 
in 
the use 
of public funds 
both in 
central and 
local governments. The 
FAP 
has provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
review and 
revise 
the 
financial legislation’ and is 
also 
providing 
support 
to 
clarifying 
the 
audit 
and 
inspection functions; increasing 
the 
awareness 
and 
involvement 
of 
the  public 
and  civil  society 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public  finances. 
Although 
the 
programme addresses mainly the central Government level, 
it’s 
work 
particularly 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
financial legislation and 
the 
internal 
audit 
function, 
have 
significant 
relevance 
to 
financial 
management 
improvements under local governments. 
A 
Major 
Policy 
Reforms 
27. 
There are number 
of 
policy reforms, which are 
currently 
being 
implemented 
by 
Government in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
LGs 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
improved 
service delivery. 
The 
highlights 
of the reforms are 
presented here 
below:

Restructuring 
of 
Local 
Governments 
Whereas 
Central 
Government 
Ministries 
were 
restructured 
in 
1998 to bring 
their 
structures 
and 
mandates 
in  line  with 
the 
Constitution 
and 
the 
decentralisation 
policy 
in 
the 
LGs Act, 
LGs were 
last 
restructured 
in 
1994. 
The 
current 
LGs 
structures are therefore unaffordable 
and are 
not quite 
relevant to the 
roles 
and 
setvice 
delivery 
responsibilities assigned 
to 
them 
under 
schedule 
I1 
of 
the LGs 
Act. The Ministry of 
Public 
Service 
(MOPS) 
in 
collaboration 
with 
MoLG 
is 
in  the 
process 
of 
concluding 
a 
study 
of 
restructuring 
LGs. 
The recommended 
model 
structures 
under the 
study 
will 
streamline 
LGs 
operations 
to be 
consistent 
with 
the mandates 
assigned 
to 
LGs 
under 
the 
LGs 
Act. 
The 
bloated, unaffordable 
local 
Government 
structures 
which 
differ 
from 
one 
Local 
Government 
to 
another 
has been 
one,of 
the 
root 
causes 
of 
the 
non-payment 
of persons 
employed 
by LGs 
leading to 
the 
accumulation 
of 
salary 
arrears,  in  some 
LGs, 
over 
the  years. 
The  results  of the  local 
Government 
restructuring 
process 
therefore will 
provide a 
minimum 
and 
affordable 
structure 
to  local 
governments 
at 
the  same  time 
effectively 
deliver 
the 
decentralised 
functions 
as 
spelt out under 
schedule 
I1 
of 
the 
LGs 
Act. 
Once 
the 
funding 
modality 
for the 
structure is 
adopted, 
the 
budgeting 
for 
staff 
salary  will 
be 
based  on  the 
LGs 
approved 
structures. 
As 
Government 
clears 
the backlog 
of 
the 
arrears, 
this  arrangement 
will, 
no 
doubt, 
curtail 
the 
increasing 
trend in 
creation 
of 
salary arrears. 
Fiscal 
Decenfralisation 
Strategy 
(FDS) 
This 
strategy 
aims 
at 
streamlining 
the modalities 
of 
the 
intergovernmental 
fiscal 
transfer 
systems 
(guidelines, 
reporting 
systems, 
planning, 
budgeting, 
allocation formulae, 
monitoring 
requirements, 
etc) and 
enhancing the 
LGs 
autonomy  to 
make 
decisions 
according 
to 
local  priorities 
and  thereby 
deepen 
the 
decentralisation 
process. The strategy 
is 
designed 
to 
ensure 
the 
realisation 
of 
local 
autonomy  while 
at 
the 
same  time 
focusing 
on 
national 
service delivery 
targets 
and 
accountability. 
Two committees, 
with 
representatives 
drawn 
from 
Central 
and 
LGs, 
are  responsible 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
FDS; 
i.e the 
LGs 
Budget 
Committee 
(LGBC) and the 
LG 
Releases 
and 
Operations 
Committee (LGROC). 
The 
initial 
preparatory 
activities 
of  the 
strategy 
are 
supported 
by 
a joint  donor 
basket fund. 
Effective 
from 
FY 
2003/4, 
the 
transfer 
of 
resources 
based 
on 
the 
FDS 
modality will be piloted 
in 
twelve 
(12) 
districts 
and 
three 
(3) 
municipalities. 
This 
piloting 
should 
lead to the 
merger 
of 
the 
sector 
development 
grants 
with 
the 
non-sector 
development 
grants 
(LGDP 
11) 
by 
FY2005/6. 
The 
LGDP 
11 
will 
supplement and 
support 
FDS 
initiatives through 
Component 
I 
which 
contains 
a 
number 
of  follow 
up  and  support 
activities  on 
planning, 
budgeting, 
and 
monitoring and evaluation 
(M 
& 
E). 
In 
addition, the 
Local 
Development 
Grant 
under 
component 
II 
of 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
the 
basis  for 
streamlining 
the 
development 
transfer 
system. 
The LGDP 
II 
implementation 
schedule has 
been 
carefully 
designed 
to fit 
into 
the 
plan for the 
rollout 
of 
the 
FDS 
to 
ensure 
synergies between 
the 
two 
initiatives.

Integrated Financial Management 
System 
(IFMS) 
Effective  from 
FY 
2003104, 
the  Government,  through 
EFMP 
II 
will, 
introduce a  computerised 
System 
as  a  basis for  improving fiscal 
and 
financial management and 
reporting. 
The 
implementation will in 
the first 
year 
(2003/04), 
be piloted 
in 
4 
local 
governments and 
6 
ministries. This will 
be 
extended 
to 
at 
least 
6 additional districts 
in 
the 
second 
year. 
The scope 
of implementation will be extended 
to 
cover a fully-fledged 
revenue 
system 
for 
Kampala 
City Council 
in the 
second year. 
The 
implementation 
of the 
IFMS 
is 
supported 
by 
the introduction in 
the 
FY2003/04, of a 
new 
standard 
and uniform financial Chart of 
Accounts 
based 
on 
internationally acceptable 
standards and practices. This is expected 
to 
enhance 
the 
standardization 
of 
norms 
for financial 
classification, 
tracking and reporting throughout all 
levels of government.  The new systems will make 
it 
possible for 
LGs 
to 
significantly upgrade the capacity for managing accounts 
to 
produce 
final 
account timely. This reform will 
involve 
significant activity at 
LGs 
and will 
necessitate 
close 
co-ordination 
between 
LGDP 
II 
and 
EFMP 
II 
management. Significant 
capacity 
building 
will 
be 
undertaken 
at 
LGs 
to 
enable the  financial  management cadre 
to 
use 
the 
system. 
The 
Royal 
Netherlands Embassy 
(RNE) 
has fully provided the hitherto budget shortfall 
which, was 
required under 
EFMP 
II 
to 
execute 
the 
training 
in 
LGs. 
Public 
Expenditure Management 
Commift 
ee 
(PEMCOM) 
The 
PEMCOM was 
formed 
to 
coordinate and ,harmonise Government's 
activities  pertaining 
to 
public  expenditure  and  financial  management 
reforms. The PEMCOM provides a mechanism for government 
to 
plan 
and 
monitor the public expenditure reform initiatives and provide informed 
input 
to 
the 
Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit 
(PRSC) 
Matrix  and 
other 
instruments  supporting  the 
Poverty 
Eradication  Action 
Plan  (PEAP) 
implementation as they relate 
to 
PEM reform. 
The 
LGDP 
II 
together with 
other 
financial  management  related  initiatives 
fall 
within  the  PEMCOM 
coordination  mechanisms.  Membership 
to 
the  PEMCOM  includes 
the 
MoFPED  (Chair),  MoLG  and  sector  ministries. 
The 
PEMCOM 
meets 
quarterly. 
Gaps and proposals under 
LGDP 
II 
33. 
Under 
LGDP 
I, 
a 
number 
of 
initiatives were  started. These  include 
the 
development 
of 
mentoring guides for LGs; 
the 
development 
of 
LGs M 
& 
E 
manual; 
LGs 
Inspection Manual; and a Communication Information System 
(ICT) 
for 
LGs. 
Also 
started under LGDP 
1 
is 
the, review and publication 
of 
the 
LGs 
Tender  Board  Rules  and  Regulations, 
and  the 
review 
of  the 
Harmonised Participatory Planning Guide  (HPPG) for 
lower 
LGs. 
These 
initiatives shall 
be 
consolidated under LGDP 
II. 
,While significant progress 
has been 
made in the 
implementation 
of 
the 
decentralisation policy, fiscal 
decentralisation, and improving 
the 
capacities 
of 
LGs, there are still gaps, 
which shall require further attention. 
The 
gaps are outlined 
below:

Gaps related 
to 
Decentralisation Policy 
There 
is 
need 
to identify 
areas where 
sector policies, 
laws and 
regulations 
are 
inconsistent 
and/or 
not  supportive 
to 
the  overall  framework 
of 
decentralization. This 
is 
a 
major 
component 
under  FDS. 
Three  major 
issues need 
to be 
addressed, 
while 
other related 
issues may 
be included 
under 
these 
reviews. 
The 
first 
is 
the 
relationship 
' 
between 
LGs' 
administration 
and 
deconcentrated central 
Government 
Technical 
Support 
Unit (TSU), mainly 
in 
the sectors of 
water, roads 
and 
health. Second 
is 
the 
review of 
the 
LGs legal 
framework, 
especially the 
link 
between 
the LGs 
Act 
and other 
related 
Acts, 
in order 
to identify contradictions and 
find solutions 
e.g 
the Leadership 
Code, 
the 
Public 
Finance and Accountability 
Bill etc. 
Third 
is 
institutional 
reforms 
to 
make sure 
that 
they 
are 
compatible 
with the 
decentralisation 
policy 
and 
principles, for example'water 
supply 
in 
Kampala 
City is 
managed 
by 
a 
Board 
which 
has 
no 
relationship with 
the 
City Council. 
Studies 
shall 
be 
commissioned under LGDP 
II 
to 
review 
these 
relationships 
with the view to harmonising 
them, 
Gaps 
Related 
to Fiscal 
Decen 
tralisa ti0 n and Accountability. 
Districts' 
budgets 
have 
continued to 
be 
unrealistic because they 
are based 
on 
unrealistic revenue 
and 
expenditure projections. Districts Development 
Plans 
are 
still 
problem-based 
and 
not vision-based 
and 
as such 
most of the 
development  plans 
are 
not  aligned  to 
the 
available 
resources 
and 
appropriate strategies for exploiting 
the 
development opportunities 
existing 
within 
the  districts. 
There 
is 
therefore 
need 
to 
change 
the  planning 
methodology 
at 
LGs. 
Under LGDP 
II, 
the 
District Planning 
Guide shall be 
reviewed 
to bring 
it 
in 
line with visionary planning taking into 
consideration 
crossing 
cutting 
issues 
such 
as 
environment, gender, poverty 
analysis 
and 
the 
livelihood 
of 
the 
communities within 
the 
district. 
The 
major challenge confronting 
LGs 
is 
the 
increasingly 
deteriorating local 
revenue 
which 
has diminished 
the 
resources available 
to 
fund 
(a) growing 
recurrent  costs 
associated  with 
the 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
increasing 
capital 
stock 
of 
local 
infrastructure funded over 
the years; 
and 
(b) their counter-part obligations. 
It 
is 
therefore critically important 
that for 
sustainability, 
the 
LGDP 
II 
should support 
efforts'to 
enhance 
LGs 
revenue 
performances. Accordingly, component 
4 
of 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
II 
shall 
look 
at 
practical 
ways 
and means as 
to 
how 
best local revenues 
in 
LGs 
could be 
enhanced 
during 
the project time 
including policy review 
for local 
revenue. 
The 
largest proportion 
(75%) of 
the 
grants 
from 
Central Government 
to 
LGs 
constitutes conditional grants. 
This does 
not 
only 
undermine 
LGs autonomy 
in 
decision 
making to 
local 
problems but also the 
problems 
of 
multiplicity of 
reporting, accounting 
and 
monitoring formats. 
The multiplicity 
of conditional 
grants 
management 
systems 
has, 
inter 
lia, 
contributed 
to  some of 
the 
inefficiencies in 
LGs. 
In 
addition there  is  need to 
review 
the  allocation 
formulae 
for the 
sharing of 
the 
grants amongst LGs to 
ensure equity 
and 
11

40. 
fairness. 
The 
FDS 
has begun 
to 
address some 
of 
these concerns 
and 
will 
be complemented 
by LGDP 
11. 
The Office of the 
Auditor 
General 
(OAG) 
has 
the Constitutional mandate 
to 
audit the accounts 
of 
all public 
bodies. 
This 
means 
the OAG has 
to 
audit 
not 
only 
the 
accounts of 
districts 
and 
Municipal 
LGs 
in addition 
to central 
Government Ministries/Departments 
but 
also 
the 
accounts 
of all the 
Lower 
Local 
Governments (LLGs). 
The 
capacity within 
the 
OAG 
in 
terms 
of 
staff, 
skills 
and 
facilities 
is 
not 
adequate to 
carry 
out the 
full audit 
of LLGs 
in 
a 
timely manner. 
As 
a 
stopgap 
measure, 
LGDP 
II 
shall 
assist 
the 
OAG 
by 
providing financial resources for the 
procurement 
of 
private 
audit firms 
who 
shall 
audit 
LLGs’ 
accounts 
during the first 
2 
years 
of 
the 
programme. 
By 
FY2005/6 
Government 
would have put 
in 
place 
a 
more 
sustainable 
strategy 
for 
auditing 
of 
LLGs’ 
accounts. This 
strategy 
shall 
be 
implemented 
in 
tandem, 
in 
the 
short 
and 
medium term, with 
the 
Public 
Expenditure 
Review 
(PER), 
which 
would 
include, 
amongst other things, 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
financial 
management (budgeting and 
accounting) 
in 
LGs. 
Gaps 
related 
to 
Administrative Framework. 
Government 
is 
in 
the process 
of 
completing 
the 
study 
for 
restructuring 
of 
LGs 
to 
make them commensurate 
to 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
assigned 
to 
LGs 
under 
the 
1997 
LGs 
Act. 
A local 
Government 
is 
expected 
to 
“buy” 
into  a  model 
structure,  which 
is 
suitable  to 
its  respective 
site. 
The 
operationalisation 
of 
structures coupled with the lessons 
yet to 
be 
attained 
under 
the 
existing pilot  decentralisation 
of 
the 
payroll, 
will 
set 
a 
clear 
direction for 
an 
efficient decentralisation 
of 
the 
payroll 
management 
to 
LGs. 
There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) 
initiatives, 
which 
are 
currently 
on 
going. 
There 
is 
no 
link 
betwe.en 
the  various 
systems, 
leading to 
overlaps, conflicting coding 
systems 
and 
great 
transaction 
costs 
for 
LGs. 
There 
is 
therefore 
a 
clear 
need 
for 
closer 
co-operation 
and 
co- 
ordination. Under the proposed 
LGDP 
II, 
the 
LGs 
M 
& 
E 
system 
developed 
under 
LGDP 
I, 
which 
focuses 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
computerised 
M 
& 
E 
system, 
will 
strive 
to 
bring 
these 
initiatives 
into 
harmony. 
Govern

Strategy 
41. 
While 
Government 
will 
maintain the 
transfer 
of 
resources 
to 
LGs in form 
of 
conditional, 
unconditional and equalisation grant; 
the strategy to 
address 
the 
constraints to 
fiscal 
devolution 
is 
to design 
a Decentralisation 
Support 
arrangement 
as 
one 
of the 
major components 
of 
donor 
support 
to GoU, 
During 
the 
implementation 
of 
LGDP 
II 
necessary 
steps 
will 
be 
taken to 
address 
relevant 
issues 
to 
ensure 
a 
sm,ooth 
transition 
of 
the 
Decentralisation 
issues 
to 
a budget 
support modality.

42. 
The 
proposed 
LGDP 
II 
will 
be 
implemented over 
a four-year 
period 
2003- 
2007. 
The LGDP-II will address 
four mutually 
strengthening 
areas: 
support 
to 
decentralisation 
process: 
Local 
Dvelopment 
Grant; 
Local 
Government 
Capacity 
Building;  and 
LGs 
Revenue 
Enhancement. 
The 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed by 
LGDP 
It 
are 
summarised below. 
Support 
for 
the Decentralisation Process 
43. 
The 
objective of the Support for the Decentralization Process 
is 
to 
provide 
better 
co-ordination 
by strengthening the 
role of 
MoLG 
in 
co-ordinating the 
decentralisation  of  related 
activities. 
The 
LGDP 
I1 
compliments  the 
initiatives under 
Support 
to the 
Decentralisation process (SDP) financed by 
- 
DflD, 
which 
focus 
on 
the capacity 
building 
needs 
for staff 
under the 
MoLG. 
The 
support 
to 
decentralisation 
under 
LGDP 
I1 
will, 
infer 
alia, 
support 
the 
FDS 
Implementation 
process; 
and 
design 
tools 
to 
support 
the 
Decentralisation 
of 
the Development 
Budget. 
44. 
Under 
LGDP 
I, 
a  number of 
Manuals 
and  Guides 
were 
commissioned. 
These include the Harmonised 
Participatory 
Planning 
Guide 
(HPPG); 
the 
Urban Planning 
and 
Management 
Guide; 
LGs Communication 
Strategy; 
and 
LGs 
M 
& 
E 
system. 
Under 
LGDP 
11, 
support shall 
be 
extended for 
the 
implementation of the FDS and 
providing 
administrative 
tools 
for improved 
service 
delivery. The 
support will built 
on 
the 
initiatives started 
under 
LGDP 
I 
by 
(a) 
operationalising the  Harmonised Participatory  Planning  Guide 
(HPPG); 
(b) operationalising the 
Urban 
Planning Guidelines; 
(c)

Local 
Development Grants 
45. 
The objective 
of 
the 
Local 
Development Grant 
(LDG) 
is 
to 
increase non- 
sectoral development grants transferred 
to 
local governments in a timely 
and transparent manner within the planning and budgeting process. 
The 
LDG 
will 
be 
distributed 
on 
a formula basis between all 
LGs 
in 
Uganda for 
investment 
in 
local 
infrastructure 
in 
accordlance 
with 
local 
needs 
determined through local planning and budgeting processes. Although all 
LGs will 
be 
eligible 
to 
receive 
LDG 
funding, the extent 
to 
which a local 
Government will access 
the 
grant is determined 
by 
its respective capacity 
to 
meet  the  co-funding  requirement,  accountability, 
and 
performance 
conditionalities,  which 
are 
designed 
to 
incentivise 
improvements 
in 
sustainable service delivery 
at 
the 
local level. 
It,should 
be 
noted that 
the 
LGDPI  experience  reveals 
that 
most  local  governments  encountered 
constraints 
in 
satisfying the 
10% 
counterpart funding  requirements. For 
effective 
performance  of 
this 
major 
component 
under 
the 
LGDPll

programme, 
it 
is 
imperative  that  efforts 
are 
made 
to 
enhance 
local 
governments’ 
capacity 
in local 
revenue 
mobilisation. 
LGs 
Capacity Building Grants 
46. 
The 
objective of 
the 
Capacity 
Building 
Grants 
is 
to enhance 
the 
capacity 
of 
LGs 
to 
fulfil  their 
service  delivery  mandates. 
The  grants  will 
provide 
resources 
to 
enable 
LGs 
to 
strengthen staff capacities 
and 
lay 
a foundation 
for 
continued 
improvement and 
strengthening. The 
goal 
is 
to 
ensure 
that all 
LGs 
staff 
and 
politicians 
have 
the 
basic 
skills 
and 
knowledge required 
to 
perform their functions 
and 
to 
contribute to 
the 
overall 
effective 
operation 
of 
the 
government. 
The 
grants 
will 
be 
utilised 
by 
LGs 
in a 
demand driven 
manner 
according 
to 
own 
priorities 
and  combined 
with  central  quality 
assurance 
and co-ordinationlsuppott. The grants 
are 
closely related 
to 
the 
~ 
MoLG 
role 
in 
providing 
the 
National Strategic 
‘Framework 
for  Capacity 
Building 
in 
LGs 
and 
the 
Support to the Human Resource Function 
in 
LGs, 
which 
ensure 
efficient co-ordination 
and 
utilisation 
of 
the 
grants. 
In 
addition, 
the 
LGs 
performance assessment 
contains 
the 
incentive criteria 
for efficient 
use 
of 
the 
funds. 
Local Government Revenue Enhancement 
47. 
i) 
48, 
ii) 
49. 
iii) 
50. 
There 
is 
need 
to 
enhance 
the 
capacity of  LGs 
to  administer 
their 
own 
sources 
of 
revenue 
in 
order 
to 
achieve and 
sustain acceptable 
levels of 
service delivery 
and 
ensure 
that 
operational 
and 
maintenance costs 
of 
the 
investments are  properly addressed. 
Under 
the 
proposed 
LGDP 
II 
the 
following activities 
will be 
undertaken 
in 
close association with 
a 
number 
of 
other  activities 
underway 
under 
the  DDP 
I1 
to 
address 
local 
revenue 
enhancement 
in 
Uganda,  and  will  be  co-ordinated  through 
the 
Co- 
ordinating Committee 
on 
Local 
Revenue 
Enhancqment 
(CCLRE). 
Strengthening Local Revenue Policies and Legislation 
The 
MoLG 
will 
be 
assisted through 
LGDP 
II 
to 
review 
existing 
policies 
and 
regulations 
on 
LGs 
revenue mobilisation 
so 
that 
they 
reflect 
international 
best 
practice. 
Training 
of 
Politicians 
and 
Officials 
Negative statements 
made 
by some 
politicians 
regarding certain 
LGs 
taxes 
have contributed 
to the 
LGs revenue 
decline. 
Efforts 
shall 
be made under 
LGDP 
II 
to create 
a 
more 
favourable local 
environment 
to 
enhance 
local 
revenue by  training  those  responsible 
for 
making 
and  commenting 
on 
policy 
and 
those 
responsible 
for 
implementing LGs 
fiscal 
legislation 
at 
both 
Central Government and LGs 
levels. 
Strengthening 
Local 
Revenue Systems 
Under 
the 
DDP 
II, 
Government has commissioned 
a 
study 
for 
documenting 
existing 
local 
revenue enhancement 
best 
practices 
in  use 
by  LGs and 
14 
Page  95
provide alternative 
revenue 
sources 
to 
complement 
graduated 
tax. LGDP 
II 
will 
support this initiative 
and 
roll-out 
the best 
practises 
country wide 
to 
all 
LGs. 
iv) 
Extension 
of 
Property 
Tax 
System 
51. 
Government 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
revising 
the 
Local 
Governments (Rating) 
Decree 
1979, 
which currently 
provides 
a 
framework 
for Property Tax. 
The 
Local 
Government 
Rating 
Bill has 
been 
passed 
by 
Cabinet 
and 
will soon be 
tabled in 
Parliament 
for 
debate and enactment, 
,Over 
the 
implementation 
period, the 
LGDP 
II 
will implement 
the 
provision 
of 
the proposed 
law, when 
it 
comes 
into 
force, 
by 
strengthening 
the 
property 
tax 
in 
three towns where 
property 
tax 
is 
in a 
state 
of 
disrepair 
and 
pilot 
the 
extension 
of 
lessons 
learnt to 
eight 
regional 
towns and 
disseminates 
the 
results to other LGs. 
Government  shall 
monitor 
the 
success 
of 
the  various  initiatives  and 
activities undertaken to 
improve revenue performance 
of 
all 
higher 
LGs. 
This 
will 
be 
done 
by 
finalising  and  adjusting 
the 
Local 
Government 
Financial 
Information 
Analysis  System  (LGFIAS) 
- 
a  LG  revenue 
and 
expenditure monitoring 
system; 
piloting 
of

supervisors 
for all 
74 
Higher Local Governments (HLGs), 
and collection 
and verification 
of 
budgets 
and accounts 
supplied 
by visiting 
every HLG. Through 
proper 
monitoring 
weak  LGs can 
be identified 
and 
assisted through the 
Best

of 
all 
the 
LC 
Ills 
for 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
the 
program as 
a 
stopgap 
measure. This 
is 
a 
continuation of 
the 
work 
being  done 
under  LGDPI, 
For 
a  sustainable 
solution, the Office 
of 
the Auditor 
(OAG) 
will 
develop 
a 
suitable strategy as

will 
handle 
the 
audits 
of 
LLGs accounts over 
the medium 
and long term. 
Implementation 
and 
Co-ordination 
mechanism 
54. 
The 
Programme 
will 
be 
executed through 
the 
structures 
of 
the Government 
of 
Uganda. 
The 
institutional set 
up 
of the 
Programme 
will be 
closely 
linked 
and 
aligned 
to 
that 
under 
the 
FDS and Public Expenditure 
Management 
Committee 
(PEMCOM). 
Furthermore, 
close  linkages will 
be 
established 
between the 
different Committees under 
the 
FDS 
and LGDP 
I1 
namely 
the 
Policy 
Steering 
Committee 
(PSC) 
- 
concerned with 
policy  issues, the 
Project 
Technical

(PTC) 
- 
concerned 
with 
technical 
implementation 
issues, 
and 
the 
MoLG/PCU 
as 
the 
overall 
executing /co- 
ordinating 
agency. 
As 
a measure 
to 
minimise 
duplication, 
the Programme

Consistent with 
the 
Constitution 
and 
the 
Local 
Governments Act, 
1997, 
the 
participating central government institutions will maintain 
their 
roles 
in 
as 
far 
as  mentoring local governments, 
monitoring 
and  evaluation  of  LGs 
performances 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with  national 
policies,  regulations, 
standards, 
procedures 
as 
well 
as 
adherence 
to 
guidelines. 
The 
specific 
institutional 
responsibilities are: 
Roles and 
Responsibilities 
of 
MoLG 
56, 
- 
The 
MoLG will 
be 
the executing Ministry for 
LGDP-I1 
and 
the 
institution 
responsible  for 
implementing  activities 
related 
to 
support 
to 
overall 
decentralisation 
process 
and LGs revenue enhancement. 
MoLG 
will also 
be 
responsible 
for 
effecting (through 
MoFPED) 
and 
publishing 
the 
transfers 
to 
LGs 
to 
ensure transparency and 
accountability. 
The  MoLG 
will  also, 
where 
necessary, 
offer  training  and  technical  advice, 
do 
compliance 
verification, and 
mentor 
to 
enhance and 
improve 
on 
LGs 
performances. 
Areas  which 
require 
compliance 
supervision 
of 
LGs  by 
MoLG 
are  in 
tenderingkontracting; 
recruitment; 
schemes 
of 
service;

requirements (such 
as 
final  accounts,  balanced 
budget,  development  plans);  sharing 
of

reports. 
Roles 
and 
Responsibilities 
of 
Ministry 
of 
Finance, 
Planning 
and 
Economic 
Development 
(MoFPED) 
57. 
The 
MoFPED’s mandate is 
to 
manage 
and 
control public finances 
in 
a 
prudent and 
sustainable 
manner and ensure efficiency and effectiveness of 
all  public 
spending. 
In 
regard 
to 
LGDP 
11, 
MoFPED responsibilities will 
focus 
on enabling the transfer of 
the 
grant funds 
in 
a timely and expeditious 
manner 
to 
LGs 
based on 
the 
advice 
of 
the 
MoLG/PCU. 
The 
Permanent 
Secretary/ Secretary to 
the 
Treasury 
(PS/ST), who 
is 
a  member 
of 
the 
Programme Steering Committee, will play a crucial co-ordinating role with 
MoLG in ensuring the linkage and synergy between 
the 
implementation of 
the 
Fiscal  Decentralisation  Strategy 
(FDS); 
the 
Integrated 
Financial 
Management 
Services (IFMS) 
under the 
EFMP

in 
LGs 
as 
outlined 
in 
the final report 
on 
restructuring 
of 
LGs. 
The 
MoPS 
will also 
be 
required

Roles 
and 
Responsibilities of 
Line 
Ministries 
59. 
For 
an 
effective decentralisation 
process, 
it is imperative that 
cross 
sector 
issues 
are 
identified 
comprehensively and resolved. 
The 
involvement of 
the 
various 
line 
Ministries 
with 
sectoral 
mandates 
(especially 
Health, 
Education, 
Roads and Water)  in 
LGDP-II 
is therefore crucial 
to 
minimise 
areas 
of 
duplication which 
negatively 
impact 
on 
programme implementation 
at 
LGs 
level.  Under  LGDP 
II, 
provision  has 
been 
made  for 
the 
establishment of 
a 
forum and 
a process where 
stakeholders will discuss 
sectoral issues 
in 
the realm of 
decentralisation. 
This decentralisation forum 
will 
establish 
critical linkages with 
the various 
sector reviews. This forum 
will  therefore 
play  a 
major  role  in  the  development 
of 
the  Strategic 
Decentralisation Framework. 
Lastly, 
line  Ministries 
are 
expected 
to 
co- 
ordinate, 
integrate  and  provide  the  necessary  interface  between  their 
. 
respective activities related 
to 
Monitoring 
and  Evaluation 
of 
both at 
the 
centre 
and 
LGs 
level. 
Roles 
and 
Responsibilities 
of 
LGFC 
60. 
The 
LGFC 
will play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the Programme, especially as 
a 
chair 
of 
the  LGs  Budget 
Committee  LGBC) 
and 
the 
LGs  Revenue 
Enhancement Committee 
(LGREC), 
which have close links 
to 
the LDG and 
the 
LGs 
revenue  enhancement 
activities 
under 
LGDP 
II. 
All 
tax 
enhancement activities  under 
LGDP 
II 
will 
be 
,closely co-ordinated with 
other ongoing activities under 
programmes 
such as 
the 
DDP-II. The LGFC 
will 
be 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Programme Technical Committee 
(PTC) 
under 
LGDP 
II. 
Programme 
Financing 
and 
Design 
Issues 
61. 
62. 
63. 
In 
order 
to 
encourage co-ordination, LGDP 
II 
shall be 
a 
multi-donor-funded 
programme. 
It 
is Governments 
policy 
to 
encourage donors 
to 
move 
away 
from individual project financing 
to 
a 
general budget support. The LGDP 
II 
will provide 
a 
facility 
to 
allow a 
general budget support through the creation 
of 
a 
Decentralisation budget 
support 
as major component  of the  PRSC 
Policy 
matrix. 
This  will  provide  an  interface  where  donors  would 
be 
expected 
to 
provide their support to LGs under 
the 
Government's general 
budget support. 
Government  recognises  that  there  are 
a 
number 
of 
constraints 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
decentralisation policy, fiscal  decentralisation, and 
building 
the 
capacities 
of LGs 
for improved service delivery. 
The 
LGDPII 
and 
the  recently  adopted 
FDS 
therefore  are  conceived  as 
a 
bridge 
operation for broader support 
to 
Government's decentralisation policy. 
The 
design of 
the 
LGDP-II 
is 
based 
on 
eight basic 
principles; 
that is LGDP 
II 
will: 
(a) 
Support the Government's decentralisation policy and co-ordination 
of 
various initiatives, including supporting 
the 
FDS 
implementation,

ensure that 
investments 
are 
financially viable and that 
the 
recurrent 
costs  are 
adequately  addressed 
in 
the  planning,  budgeting 
and 
budget execution 
procedures; 
provide enhanced 
discretionary 
power for 
LGs 
to 
plan, budget and 
allocate 
resources  according 
to 
local  priorities with  incentives 
to 
address  national 
targets,  and 
strong 
downwards  and 
up-wards 
accountability 
; 
build  incentives  for 
LGs 
to 
improve  administrative  performance, 
ensure  sustainable 
development 
in 
own 
revenue  sources  and 
address the 
key 
basic 
service 
delivery 
areas; 
ensure ownership and participation and involvement of all levels of 
LGs, 
improve 
LGs 
administrative capacity by a demand-driven approach, 
combined 
with 
improved overall national co-ordination and Quality 
Assurance 
(QA); 
provide support 
to 
more future 
viable 
LGs,by 
focusing 
on 
supporting 
own 
revenue 
sources 
(legal 
framework, 
administration and learning); 
and finally 
improve on the relationship between central and 
LGs 
by 
supporting 
the MoLG, 
which 
is 
directly 
in charge 
of 
decentralisation. 
LGDP-II is therefore carefully 
designed 
to 
complement 
and support other 
ongoing initiatives, 
especially 
the FDS, 
the 
DflD 
Decentralisation Support 
Programme and direct District support programmes 
by 
bilateral donors 
to 
specific  districts  (Danida, 
USAID, 
Ireland,  Austria,  Belgium 
etc.). 
The 
design 
of 
LGDP 
II 
has 
also 
taken  into  consideration 
the 
existence  of 
parallel programmes, which  most have agreed 
to 
adjust 
to the 
LGDP-II 
framework. 
Such 
programmes include 
the 
support to MoLG 
(DflD's 
DSP) 
and the SDU by USAID. 
Conclusion 
65. 
1 
would 
wish 
to 
take this 
opportunity 
to 
reiterate Government's commitment 
to 
the continued development and implementation of the decentralisation 
policy, 
fiscal 
decentralisation and the building of 
LGs 
capacities 
for 
efficient, 
effective 
and 
improved service delivery 
to 
the  people 
of 
Uganda. 
The 
Government 
is 
commitment 
to 
streamlining 
the 
decentralisation 
of 
LGs 
development 
budget  with 
special  focus 
on 
shifting 
resources 
from 
projectlprogramme support 
to 
decentralised budget support. 
The 
LGDPll 
is 
expected 
to 
work 
out 
the  operational modalities  attached 
to 
this  policy 
change. 
This 
policy 
shift 
and 
commitment, 
would 
not 
only 
ensure 
sustainability 
and 
consistency within 
the 
national  Mid Term  Expenditure 
Framework 
(MTEF) 
but will 
also 
allow a regular and systematic review 
of 
decentralisation and 
LGs 
as 
a 
sector.

be 
strengthened 
to 
take 
into 
account 
new 
policy 
and 
Project direction. 
Performance 
monitoring 
will 
be 
done 
through a 
multi-pronged 
approach 
to 
suit 
the 
variety 
of 
programme 
components: 
(i) 
The 
annual 
Local 
Government 
Assessment 
(LGA) 
for 
minimum 
governance 
criteria 
and 
performance 
measures 
which 
is 
a 
bridge 
process 
to 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
compliance 
inspection. 
The 
LGA 
provides 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
Local 
Government 
Annual Financial 
Assessment. 
The 
Financial 
Assessment 
Report 
acts 
as 
a 
trigger 
for 
annual 
releases. 
The 
quality 
of 
the 
LGA 
will 
be 
verified 
through 
an independent 
assessment 
of 
the 
LGA 
process. 
(ii) 
Thematic reviews 
to 
determine 
performance 
of 
key 
issue 
areas; 
(iii) 
Regular 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
through routine 
checks 
and 
on-spot 
monitoring 
using 
Local 
Government 
Information, Communication 
System 
(LOGICS) 
developed under 
the 
LGDP 
I 
M&E 
and 
Inspection 
of 
Local 
Governments; 
(iv) 
Quarterly 
Project 
Reviews 
that 
build 
on 
the 
existing 
Project Technical Committee 
meetings; 
(v) 
Periodic 
(quarterly and 
annual) 
monitoring 
of 
the 
Key 
Performance 
indicators 
(KPIs); 
(vi) 
Monitoring 
of 
revenue enhancement 
activities 
and 
LGs 
co-financing 
efforts 
using 
the 
Local 
Government 
Financial Analysis 
and 
Information 
System 
(LGFAIS) 
and 
the 
co-financing 
monitoring 
charts 
(CMC) 
introduced 
under 
LGDP 
I 
respectively; 
(vii) 
Output/Impact 
assessment 
and 
technical 
audits; 
(viii)Quarterly 
programme 
reviews; and 
(ix) 
Midterm 
reviews. 
The 
assessment 
of 
Minimum 
Conditions and 
Performance 
Measures 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
a central 
pillar 
of 
the 
LGDP 
I1 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
mechanism. 
The 
objectives 
of 
the 
Local 
Government 
Assessment 
are 
to: 
(i) 
verify 
compliance 
of 
the 
Local 
Governments 
to 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
laws and 
national 
guidelines especially 
the 
Local 
Government 
Act 
1997, 
Finance 
and 
Accounting 
Regulations 
1998 
and Tendering and 
Procurement 
Rules 
and Regulations 
2000; 
(ii) 
determine the 
LGs 
that 
have the 
capacity 
to 
manage 
discretionary development 
funds 
and 
therefore 
eligible 
to 
access 
the 
Local 
Development 
Grant 
(LDG) 
under 
LGDP 
II; 
(iii) 
provide 
incentives/disincentives 
for 
LG 
performance 
through rewarding 
good 
and 
sanctioning 
poor 
performance 
by 
Local 
Governments; 
and 
(iv) 
assist 
the 
Local 
Governments 
to 
identify 
functional 
capacity 
gaps 
and 
needs. 
The 
assessment 
is 
a 
major 
input 
in 
the 
development 
of 
an 
appropriate 
capacity 
building 
plan. 
The 
assessment 
of 
Minimum 
Conditions and 
Performance 
Measures 
will 
be 
done 
in 
two 
phases: 
first, 
the 
internal 
assessment 
by 
the 
District/Municipality 
of 
their Sub-counties/Division 
and 
Town 
Councils 
to 
identify 
those, 
which 
have 
met 
the 
Minimum 
Conditions and 
Performance 
Measures 
and 
- 
9s 
- 
Page  102
those, 
which 
have not. 
The 
Internal 
Assessment 
will 
be 
conducted 
during 
June-July, 
at 
least 
one 
month 
before the 
national 
assessment. Second, 
the 
National 
Assessment 
Team 
(NAT) 
will 
assess 
the 
Districts 
and 
Municipalities 
during 
July 
- 
August 
of 
every 
year. 
A 
40 
percent 
sample 
of 
Sub-countiesIDivisions 
and 
Town 
Councils 
will 
be 
assessed 
to 
validate 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
internal 
District/Municipal 
assessment. 
To 
guide 
the 
assessment 
process, 
the 
Assessment 
Manual 
for 
Local 
Governments 
detailing 
the 
assessment 
process, procedures, 
information 
sources, 
and checklists 
has 
been 
upgraded 
to 
capture 
new 
directions 
such 
as 
revenue 
generation 
and 
capacity 
building. 
Reporting 
and 
feedback 
from 
the 
assessment 
will 
be 
emphasized 
both 
at 
the 
Local 
Government and 
national 
levels. 
The internal 
assessment 
team 
will 
prepare 
a 
report 
on 
the 
assessment 
using 
an agreed format. 
The 
use 
of 
a 
standardized 
format 
will 
help 
determine 
qualification 
and 
allow 
comparison 
of 
the 
internal 
and 
national 
assessment 
results. 
The 
report 
will 
be 
a 
critical monitoring 
tool 
and 
reference 
for 
the 
Project 
at 
that 
level. 
The 
National 
Assessment 
team 
will 
produce 
2 
reports, 
a 
synthesis 
report capturing 
key 
processes, 
finding 
and 
recommendations and 
a 
Local 
Government 
report detailing 
the performance 
under 
the 
respective indicators. 
The 
objectivity 
and 
credibility 
of 
the 
assessment 
process 
will 
be 
determined 
through 
an 
external 
quality control 
and 
vetting 
mechanism. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
national 
assessment 
will 
define 
LG 
performance; 
help 
identify 
good 
practice 
and 
lessons, 
which 
will 
inform 
subsequent 
MoLG 
support. 
The 
Minimum 
Conditions 
and 
Performance Measures 
are 
derived 
from 
the 
GoU 
laws 
and 
guidelines, 
including 
among 
others, 
The 
Local 
Governments 
Act 
1997 
(and 
Amendments 
2000), 
Finance 
and 
Accounting 
Regulations 
1998, 
Local 
Government 
Tendering 
and 
Procurement 
Regulations 
2000, 
and 
the 
National 
Gender 
Policy 
1997. 
Therefore, 
the 
assessment 
under 
LGDP 
I1 
is 
an 
interim 
sub-set 
of 
the 
MoLG 
routine 
compliance inspection and 
monitoring 
activities. 
Thematic 
reviews 
to 
determine 
performance 
of 
key 
issue 
areas: 
The 
annual 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
reviews 
will 
progressively 
examine 
thematic 
issues 
and 
provide 
an in-depth 
analysis 
of 
the performance 
of 
key 
indicators. 
Under 
LGDP 
1, 
thematic 
reviews 
were 
instrumental 
in 
flagging 
key 
operational and 
policy 
concerns. 
This 
review, 
which 
is 
usually carried out 
mid 
each 
FY, 
shall continue. 
Regular monitoring and 
evaluation through routine 
checks 
and 
on-spot 
monitoring: 
The 
MoLG 
is 
in 
the 
process 
of 
implementing 
the 
Local 
Government 
Information, Communication 
System 
(LOGICS). 
The 
system 
will 
provide 
a 
one-stop centre 
for 
multi-sectoral 
Local 
Government 
monitoring 
and evaluation 
instruments 
and 
inspection 
reports. 
Quarterly Project Reviews: 
The 
quarterly rotational Project Technical Committee 
(PTC) 
meetings 
will 
provide 
the 
much-needed 
project 
reviews 
and 
short 
intervals. 
The PTCs 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
rotational 
on 
a 
regional 
basis and have an 
in-built 
field-monitoring 
component, 
which 
offers 
on 
spot 
assessment 
on 
work 
in 
progress. 
The 
involvement 
of 
Civil 
Society Organisations 
(CSOs) 
in 
the 
PTCs 
has 
proven 
to 
be 
of 
added 
value 
to 
the 
entire 
project 
management process.
