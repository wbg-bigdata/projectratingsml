FROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
GAS AND OIL ENGINEERING ?ROJECT
(CREDIT NO. S-25-BO)
HIGHLIGHTS
The fundamental objective of the Gas and Oil Engineering project
was to prove the existence of sufficient additional reserves of natural
gas for Bolivia to undertake a proiect of gas exports to Brazil, and help
reverse the decline in production in the main oil field in the country by
means of secondary recovery. Both objectives were successfully attained,
despite several obstacles encountered. Brazil did not implement the gas
sales agreement of 1978 (for reasons unrelated to this project), but the
information on reserves provided by the project remains valid, and has
been used in 1988/89 as a basis for further negotiations with Brazil.
Implementation of the project suffered general delays due
basically to managerial and financial difficulties, cumbersome
procurement procedures, to frequent changes in the Central Government and
in the executing agency, financial constraints resulting from the
economic crisis the country suffered during project execution, and
finally the unexpectedly long rainy seasons that postponed the seismic
survey acquisition and the appraisal drilling program in the Boomerang
Hills area. For these reasons the Closing Date was postponed twice. All
project components were implemented satisfactorily and without cost
overruns, and the credit was fully disbursed.
One of the main objectives of the project was established by the
appraisal drilling operations which proved the existence of incremental
gas reserves in excess of 1.6 TCF in the Boomerang and Chaco areas. The
information obtained in the seismic survey was a key input to the success
of the appraisal drilling.
Secondary recovery by water injection in the Monteagudo field,
Bolivia's main oil field, has been in operation since April 1984. It is
significantly helping to reverse the decline in the production of the
field which means additional oil reserves and a reduced need for oil
imports.
As a result of the successful appraisal drilling program, the Bank
prepared a second petroleum project (Vuelta Grande Recycling Project),
which enables the recovery of condensates and LPG by recycling the field
gas, thus improving declining liquid hydrocarbon production in-Bolivia.



BOLIVIA
GAS AND OIL ENGINEERING PROJECT
CREDIT S-25-BO
I. BACKGROUND
INTRODUCTION
1.1      This report is about the gas and oil engineering project supported
by Credit S-25-BO (US$16.0 million; 1980), as provided by the International
Development Association (IDA) to the Government of Bolivia, which relent
the proceeds of the credit to the national oil and gas company, Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB;. This chapter covers Bank lending
to the energy sector, and the organization of the energy sector and of
YPFB.
BANK/IDA LENDING TO ThE ENERGY SECTOR
1.2      Since 1964, the World Bank and IDA have provided the energy sector
in Bolivia with financing amounting to about US$121.0 million: six credits
and one loan for electric power, totalling US$66.7 million; and one loan
and two credits for gas and oil, totalling US$54.3 million (Annex 1.1).
Credit S-25-BO was the first credit to benefit the gas and oil sector.
RESOURCES AND ORGANIZATION OF THE ENERGY SECTOR
1.3      Relative to its needs, Bolivia has a large energy resource base.
Proven natural gas reserves in 1983 were equivalent to 40 years of
production at current levels, about 4.1 trillion cubic feet. There is
abundant hydroelectric potential (18,000 MV), of which only 287 MW has been
developed. Proven reserves of liquid hydrocarbons amount to about 154
million barrels, the equivalent of about 17 years of present production.
There are considerable reserves of firewood, though undeveloped, but no
significant coal deposits. Bolivia is a net energy exporter; but its
largest energy resource -- natural gas -- faces limited domestic and
foreign demand. In 1984, 822 of the net output of natural gas was exported
to Argentina.
1.4      The Ministry of Energy and Hydrocarbons (MEH) is responsible for
the energy sectcr and supervises YPFB, private operators, and the electric-
power utilities. MEH is responsible for energy planning. Electricity
tariffs and petroleum product prices are decided by MEH, normally after
consultations in Cabinet.
YPFB
1.5      An autonomous state company, YPFB is responsible for hydrocarbon
exploration, production, transportation, pipeline construction and
operation, refining and distribution, as well as imports and exports of oil
and gas products. The Santa Cruz Division operates the fields of Colpa,
Caranda, and Rio Grande. A subsidiary, Yacibol Bogoc Transportacoes (YABOG)



- 2-
operates the Santa Cruz-Argentina pipeline, which the Bank helped to
finanice (Annex 1.1).   Assisted by an assistant general manager and various
department heads, a general manager implements policy as establ.ished by the
Board, all but one of whose members are appointed by the President of the
Republic.  Identification of new gas markets, development of recently
discovered condensate fields and enhanced oil recovery have been top
priorities of YPFB and the Government. In 1986, the staff of YPFB numbered
7,640. The Government is reorganizing YPFB to improve efficiency, reduce
its role in the sector, encourage private capital, and increase petroleum
production and tax revenues.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      This chapter discusses the background and some of the problems
encountered in preparing the project; origin, rationale, preparation and
appraisal of the project; and negotiations and other steps leading to
effectiveness of the credit.
BACKGROUND
2.2      In December 1977, an energy sector mission noted that there had
been a decline in oil production in Bolivia during the years since 1974 and
that exploratory drilling had yielded sigiificant deposits of natural gas
but very little condensate. (During the 19?0s, YPFB had carried out
exploration drilling by using its own drilling crews, drilling craws
operating under contract with YPFB, and private, foreign oil companies
operating under "production sharing" contracts. The bulk of the risk
investment for exploration had been supplied by the foreign companies).
This represeuted an opportunity for the World Bank to provide financing and
to play a useful part in sector development. Subsequently, this engineering
project evolved from the efforts of GOB, YPFB, and the Bank to reverse the
decline in oil production and to justify the future export to Brazil of
natural gas.
ORIGIN, RATIONALE, PREPARATION, AND APPRAISA'. 'F THE PROJECT
2.3      In 1978, GOB initiated discussions with the Bank Group on possible
financing for a project to increase oil or gas production. A reconnaissance
mission (January/February, 1988) determined that because oil production was
declining, Bolivia faced the prospect of needing to purchase imported oil,
with financial strain on its foreign exchange reserves, unless it
discovered additional domestic sources. Domestic petroleum price levels
were less than half the international price level, causing YPFB to incur
losses on sales of refined products in the domestic market. Because of
this, YPFB lacked sufficient internally generated financial resources to
carry out an appropriate level of exploratory drilling. The mission also
found that YPFB did not-share the interest of GOB in obtaining Bank/IDA
financing to prepare a secondary recovery project, but was Inte'e'sted in
obtaining such financing for oil exploration or for a natural gas pipeline
from Santa Cruz to La Paz.



- 3 -
2.4      IDA subsequently reviewed the investment program of YPFB and
informed the Government that financial assistance could be provided for
seismic studies, geophysical studies, secondary recovery projects, and gas
pipelines.  IDA staff expected that the Kiroposed engineering project would
accelerate preparation of a number of high-return projects for finat.cing
during FY80-FY82 and would strengthen the dialogue between GOB, YPFB. and
the Association on sectoral and institutional issues.
2.5      In October 1978, the Association sent a second mission to review
the oil and gas sector investment and work programs to determine in what
areas and projects it could be of assistance. The mission endorsed
developing the export potential of the gas fields in the Boo'merang Hills
(north of Santa Cruz), and gave high priority to increasing oil production
in the Monteagudo field, the only one supplying heavy crude, by means of
water flooding. With respect to developing the gas fields, the obvious next
steps were to carry out seismic work to identify the most promising parts
of the fields and then to drill appraisal wells to prove the size of the
fields. It was hoped that Tesoro and Occidental, two major international
oil companies, would undertake a complementary exploratory program in the
fields at La Vertiente and Porvenir. The information developed from this
discovery activity would determine whether there was sufficient gas to meet
existing commitments to Argentina, expected domestic demand, and possible
future sales to Brazil.
2.6      It was the opinion of the mission that enhanced oil recovery and
increasing sales of gas (esljcially to Brazil) offered promising sources
and savings of foreign exchange; and that IDA should finance an engineering
project, consisting of yarious studies and a pilot project for secondary
oil recovery. Further justifying the interest of IDA in this project was
the signing (on 10125/78) of a letter of intent by the respective Ministers
of Energy of Bolivia and Brazil with respect to a buy-sell contract for
natural gas. The letter covered sales of 400 MHCFD, provided that adequate
reserves could be proven and that pricing, on the basis of liquid fuels
that the gas would replace, could be agreed.
2.7      The mission identified the following elements which, after further
refinement, constituted the engineering project:
(a) a pre-feasibility study to verify market prospects and optimum
design alternatives for a natural gas pipeline from Santa Cruz to La Paz;
(b) studies to determine the optimum technology and engineering
design for a pilot, secondary recovery (water injection) project to
increase oil production at the Monteagudo fields:
(c) seismic surveys (1.600 line kilometers) and data
interpretation to identify the more promising sites in the Boomerang Hills
for appraisal drilling, plus the reinterpretation of a previous survey in
the Chaco area;
(d) a program of appraisal drilling in the Boomerang Hills (12
wells) and the Chaco area (2 wells) to prove.sufficient natural gas
reserves to justify construction of a natural gas pipeline from Santa Cruz
to the Brazilian border.



2.8      Later, a separate study of the market for domestic gas use was
added to the definition of the project. As finally defined, the project
was expected to cost US$41.8 million, including a foreign cost of US$27.5
million. IDA would supply a credit of US$16.0 million to help cover the
foreign cost; IDB would supply a loan for the same amount, US$16.0 million,
(US$11.5 million to cover foreign costs and US$4.5 million for local
costs); and YPFB would cover the remaining loral costs, US$9.8 million. The
following table shows the expected components, costs, and sources of
financing for the project:

2.9      Having confirmed that the low level of domestic petroleum prices
and the financial problems of YPFB were major issues, the October, 1978
mission recommended that IDA: (i) seek the Government of Bolivia's
commitment to a program of future price increases approaching the
international level for petroleum products over an agreed time period;
(ii) make Board presentation conditional on implementation of price
increases consistent with this commitment; and (iii) devise with YPFB and
GOB during appraisal a priority investment program and a program of
financial rehabilitation (price increases, tax reductions, debt
rescheduling, and access to foreign exchange for debt-servicing purposes).
2.10     In December 1978 and January 1979, two preparation missions
visited Bolivia. In addition to investigating further the ju3tification for
the various project elements, the mission recommended an advance ("Project
Preparation Facility") for financing a pre-feasibility study for the
Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline, a study of the domestic gas market, and an
updating of natural gas reserves. Prior to departure of the second mission,
IDB and IDA began to coordinate their efforts with respect to the project.
2.11     IiDA appraised the project in March 1979. Subsequently, three post-
appraisal missions visited Bolivia. These missions were required to
complete the definition of the project and to deal with various unforeseen
disbursement, financial, technical and procurement problems. It was
expected that disbursements of the IDA credit would finance 1002 of the
foreign expenditures for the seismic surveys, well services (other than
well logging) for the appraisal drilling, imported goods for the appraisal
drilling and the secondary oil recovery components, and consultant
serrices. Theyawould also finance 90? of locally procured imported goods
neecled for appraisal drilling, well services and the secondary oil recovery
components. The IDB loan would finance 100? of drilling and well logging
.



services. In addition, IDB would disburse about US$700,000 for purchases
of local materials related to drilling services.
2.12     After appraisal, it became apparent that the recommendations for
improving the financial condition of YPFB, plus any related financial
covenants, constituted a sensitive political issue in Bolivia, which could
be better addressed in connection with the larger "follow-on" project that
was then envisaged, rather than this engineering project. The Bank
recommended that the best way for YPFB to improve its financial situation
would be to install compressors to increase gas sales to Argentina. The
materialization of such additional sales, plus the implementation (11/79)
of significant price increases for petroleum products, satisfied the
Association that sufficient counterpart financing would be available for
the project.
2.13     Both before and after appraisal, the Association spent
considerable time monitoring negotiations between: (i) YPFB and Tesoro and
Occidental in connection with "production-sharing, contracts and
exploration activities- and (ii) Bolivia and Brazil in connection with
natural gas sales. In regard to the former, the Bank took the attitude that
agreement between YPFB and the oil companies should not be a condition for
disbursement, as the companies were reluctant to start their own
exploration programs unless Bolivia and Brazil had signed a contract
specifying the sales price. In November 1979, IDA expressed itself
satisfied with the progress on negotiations with the international private
oil companies -- that is, the Government of Bolivia had made a reasonable
offer to one of the companies to participate in the export sale to Brazil
and a reasonable offer to the second company was pending. Faced with the
unwillingness of the Brazilians to commit themselves beyond what had been
expressed in the exchange of ministerial letters, the Association took a
flexible attitude and decided to proceed to negotiations.
2.14     A parallel issue was the question of whether Bolivia was
creditworthy for a loan, or would qualify for an IDA credit. Since the
Government's sovereign guarantee was not considered acceptable, the Bank
Group sought to secure repayment of the proposed loan, with the proceeds of
Bolivian gas sales to Argentina. These proceeds were being deposited in a
trust account established in connection with the Bolivia-Argentina gas
pipeline, which the Bank had helped to finance (Loan 635-BO) and payments
were being made from the trust account to the creditors who had helped
finance the pipeline. However the Bank Group failed to persuade the other
creditors to agree to an amendment of a lenders' trust agreement, so
decided that a credit was the more appropriate lending instrument.
NEGOTIATIONS, BOARD PRESENTATION, SIGNING, AND EFFECTIVENESS
2.15     The project was processed as an engineering credit (hence the "SI
in the credit number). That is, it would be refinanced by a follow-on
project --which never in fact materialized. Accordingly, no separate staff
appraisal report was written. No major problems delayed negotiations
(12/17-20/79) or Board approval (02/26/80). The proceeds of the IDA credit
would be relent by GOB to YPFB for a term of 10 years including 3 years of
grace with a rate of interest of 8.252 per annum. The credit would be
refinanced if, based on the results of this project, a Bank loan were made



for a gas export project or for a subsequent phase or phases of the
Monteagudo secondary oil recovery component.
2.16     The IDB made its intended parallel loan of US$16 million with a
term of 40 years, including 10 years of grace, at a rate of interest of 12
per annum. The Government of Bolivia agreed to relend the proceeds of this
loan to YPFB on the same terms.
2.17     Signing of the IDA credit agreement was delayed four months (to
06/18/80) because of slow action on the part of the Bolivian Congress in
approving the credit. Effectiveness was then held up due to a cross-
effectiveness condition with the IDB loan, and delay by the Government in
meeting IDB's effectiveness conditions. In order not to delay
implementation of the project, IDA agreed to convert the meeting of IDB's
conditions for effectiveness into a dated covenant of the IDA credit
agreement. On this basis, the credit became effective on December 11, 1980.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
PROJECT PREPARATION FACILITY
3.1      Two of the three components to be financed under the PPF were
successfully completed in good time; the third was carried out late.
Firstly, the preliminary feasibility report on the Bolivia-Brazil gas line
was completed by a US consultant in February 1980. Secondly, the
reprocessing and reinterpretation of the.250 line-km of seismic data of an
area nortt. of the city of Santa Cruz was completed by a US firm. The third
component, the domestic gas market study, was delayed because of
disagreements with the Mexican consultant selected, on specifics of the
contract.
SEISMIC SURVEYING
3.2      Part of the results of the seismic survey were needed for locating
the wells to be drilled under the gas appraisal drilling component. IDA
approved advance contracting of about US$5.8 m_llion (US$3.3 million under
the credit) for these services in late 1979. It also approved retroactive
financing of US$ 0.3 million for work which was expected to be done prior
to credit approval. The Controller General of Bolivia rejected the tenders
unQpened because the credit had not yet been approved by Congress. In the
meantime, in order not to delay the start of the drilling operations, YPFB
used their own seismic consultants, crew and equipment, to start a 1,100
line-km survey in the Boomerang area where the first well was to be sited.
Heavy rains at the end of 1981 curtailed work and only 487 line-km could be
completed by the end of May 1982. To complete the 1100-1600 line-km of
seismic survey intended in the Boomerang Hills, tenders were then requested
from the only two companies which accepted the invitation to bid. A US
consultant was subsequently awarded the termination of the field work and
an Argentinian firm processed the seismic data.
3.3      As the seismic data became available, it was interpreted by the
American consultant. The information indicated the existence of several
large structures in the Boomerang Hills area. The information was used in



deciding locations of wells in the Boomerang Hills field which led to the
success but drilling operations there.
APPRAISAL DRILLING
3.4      IDB's US$16 million cofinancing all went into appraisal drilling.
The drilling of 14 wells was expected to prove the existence of up to a
total of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of recoverable reserves from the
Boomerang area fields, where 12 wells were to be drilled, and from Vuelta
Grande (Chaco), where two wells were to be drilled.
3.5      Heavier than usuai rains in 1981 and 1982 caused serious damage to
roads and bridges in the Boomerang Hills area and delayed this component
for two years.   IDA had some misgivings over the way the contracting of
the drilling services was handled (elimination of certain companies at the
pre-qualification stage for apparently trivial reasons). Although financed
by IDB, these contracts were basic to the services and materials which were
to be financed by IDA. Contracts were eventually signed with a local firm
for the drilling of eight wells and an Argentinian firm for the other four.
Contracts for well services suffered delays during approval by the
Controller General's Office, where administrative procedures were
cumbersome, inefficient and costly.
3.6      Only eleven of the twelve wells initially scheduled in the
Boomerang area were actually drilled, as a result of a YPFB decision to
drill only one of the two wells planned in the Palometas Noroeste area, as
it would provide sufficient information to confirm gas reserves in the
area. The results of the eleven wells drilled are presented in Table 1.
Gas was discovered in three wells, oil in two; gas reserves were confirmed
in three wells, with oil discovery in one of them, and four wells were
abandoned as dry holes. The appraisal drilling was useful in a further
sense, since the results identified the point of contact in the field
between gas and water. This and prior seismic information indicated the
dimension of the gas field and provided guidance for future drilling of the
gas-bearing reservoir.
3.7      Retroactive financing of US$0.4 million was approved for well
services for the two Vuelta Grande wells, drilled by YPFB during the dry
season before moving their rig from the Chaco area.   The two wells planned
were plugged and abandoned as dry holes.
GAS RESERVES QUANTIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION
3.8      The gas reserve quantification component was initially limited to
five fields. The certification of reserves was required by Brazil for
signing the gas sale agreement on the gas pipeline. The drilling showed
that the quantities to be verified had been overestimated. At the request
of the Government of Bolivia this component was therefore -extended to cover
all of YPFB's gas fields, which were divided into three groups for bidding
purposes. After extremely slow international bidding procedures and
internal differences within YPFB about contract awarding, the works were
finally awarded to three different US firms. Results from this study are
presented in Table 2.



-8-
MONTEAGUDO SECONDARY RECOVERY
3.9      The major equipment and material for the Monteagudo secondary
recovery component and civil construction for water supply and water
injection were procured and constructed satisfactorily, although Bolivia's
deteriorating economic situation caused delays during 1982-83. In
particular, these affected YPFB's procuring of its share of secondary minor
equipment and material. However, the facility started operations in
April 1984.
IV.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
4.1      YPFB's financial condition, which was robust at the beginning of
project implementation, became precarious from 1982 on as a consequence of
foreign exchange restrictions. Domestic petroleum product prices decreased
alarmingly in dollar terms as the exchange rate slid from US$1 = 25
Bolivian pesos to US$1 - 500 Bolivian pesos in 1983 and US$1 = 9,000 in
1984. The situation was further exacerbated by the failure of Argentina to
pay for gas deliireries from April 1982 on. However, YPFB managed to
provide about 41Z of the funds required for the project, as had been agreed
at appraisal.
V. PROJECT COST AND DISBURSEMENT
5.1      The physical components of the project were all completed more or
less as planned with only a moderate cost overrun. Actual total project
cost was US$53.6 million as compared to the planned US$41.8 million, or
28.22 above the appraisal estimate. The differences between actual and
planned costs -ere due mainly to material cost increases and the inclusion
of certain materials not considered at appraisal. A comparison between
actual and planned costs is presented in Table 3.
5.2      The last disbursement was made in April 1985, three years later
than foreseen at appraisal. Table 4 compares appraisal and actual timing
of disbursements.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORHANCE
6.,      YPFB was severely affected by the lack of foreign exchange
resulting from delays in payment by Argentina for gas imported from Bolivia
and by exchange control restrictions, which made payment of technical
services and urgent imports difficult.
6.2      During the first years of project implementation, YPFB's showed
its ability for timely decisions and technical expertise, taking over
seismic survey operations with its own manpower when the contracting of
expert firms was delayed by the central government.
6.3      YPFB's technical ability to handle the project load was weakened
by the dismissal for political reasons of senior officials and their
resignation because of the erosion of their salaries. In the later years
of project implementation relations between labor and management were poor



- 9 -
and disturbances occurred, affecting YPFB's operations to the extent that
some of its divisions were shut down by strikers. One of the most
worrisome aspects of these disturbances was that YPFB's staff had already
been affected by the departure of more than a dozen top technicians and the
company appeared drifting out of control and losing its ability to handle
the extra work that the Bank's project was bringing.
6.4      The Borrower's performance with respect to the obligations set
forth in the loan agreement was satisfactory, although provision of
Financial Statements, Progress Reports, and Project Completion Report
suffered substantial delays. Annex 2.2 summarizes the major covenants of
the credit agreement.
VII. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
7.1      The main economic benefit arising from this credit is the improved
knowledge of oil and natural gas reserves. The minimum reserves required
by Brazil were proven and gas exports to Argentina are now the most
important source of foreign exchange for Bolivia. Benefits have also
accrued from the oil recovery in Monteagudo, where the decline in the
production of the field was reversed and the need for imports reduced. The
information obtained in this project was instrumental to be preparation of
the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline. Unfortunately the sales agreement could
not be implemented by Brazil as planned, for reasons unrelated to this
project. However, the information is still valid and has been used in
1988/89 as a basis for further negotiations with Brazil.
7.2      Because this was an engineering project, no economic rate of
return was calculated at appraisal nor ex-post for this report.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.1      IDA contributed significantly during project identification and
preparation by helping the borrower clarify its priorities based on a
positive assessment of the natural gas potential in Bolivia. The project
was timely and well selected, since it represented a high priority for the
country, i. e. development of a high-potential source of foreign exchange.
However, the Association's failure to require that seismic operations
necessary for the drilling component be completed before loan negotiations
contributed to the cost and time overruns.
8.2      IDA provided adequate supervision during implementation with an
average of three missions per year. In 1982, when the project experienced
significant problems, five supervision missions visited Bolivia. The
Association displayed understanding and flexibility in agreeing to changes
in project scope and time extensions required to meet problems and delays.
IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.1      The project was successful in attaining its intended objectives of
proving the existence of sufficient additional reserves of natural gas for
Bolivia to pursue negotiations with Brazil for gas exports to that country,



- 10 -
by significantly increasing the knowledge of its oil and gas reserves. The
information obtained in the seismic survey was a key input to the appraisal
drilling program, which proved incremental gas reserves in excess of 1.6
TCF in the Boomerang and Chaco areas.
9.2      The construction of secondary recovery facilities by water
injection proved to be a significant contribution to the reversal of the
decline in production and recovery of additional oil reserves. The
certification and quantification of gas reserves confirmed and specified
the reserves available for export agreements with Brazil and potentially to
other countries.
9.3      These achievements were all the more commendable in that Bolivia's
political and economic situation deteriorated dramatically during the
implementation period. The deterioration of YPFB's financial situation can
be traced directly to the country's economic collapse and to confusion in
the central government as to its priorities. The resulting loss of senior
staff triggered some delays, due to internal differences among the senior
staff remaining over how the project should be implemented, but most of the
delays recorded were caused by the Government's slow procurement procedure.
9.4      The project did not include a specific institution-building
effort. The need for such an effort became more apparent as implementation
proceeded and staff were lost. Remedial action had to await the
stabilization of the macro-economic situation in 1986-7 and the start of
new IDA operations: the Vuelta Grande project and the two Reconstruction
Import Credits. YPFB has revised its bidding and contract award
procedures, and since April 1988 the Government has required that all
public-sector contracts over 100,000 Bolivianos (about US$ 41,000) are
handled by foreign procurement agencies. In principle this should speed up
implementation and help keep costs within budget. A start has been made on
improving conditions of professional employment, though progress in raising
salaries has been constrained by the continuing tight economic situation
and the need for consistency across public-sector agencies. These
initiatives deserve IDA's continued support.
9.5      Much of the justification for the project rested on the assumption
that Bolivia would soon start selling gas to Brazil, for which the
confirmation of gas reserves was a necessary condition. That Bolivia and
Brazil did not succeed in putting into effect a mutually beneficial
contract is regrettable, but can not be blamed on the engineering project.
Rather, it may be concluded that, despite a deteriorating econonmic
environment during implementation, the project made a significant immediate
contribution to the supply of oil and gas for domestic consumption and an
important potential contribution to Bolivia's earnin' of foreign exchange.
