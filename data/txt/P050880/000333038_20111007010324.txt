January 25, 2002 to June 30, 2006, in the value of US$30.1 m., and an Additional Financing -
AF (46251 -BR) in the value of US$30.0 m., with the same project development objectives,
design and implementation arrangements, approved October 5, 2006 and closed January 31,
2010. The AF was designed to scale up project activities in small scale socio-economic
infrastructure and services to enhance the impact of a well-performing, first-stage, community-
driven development project. For purposes of this ICR, the project is treated as one operation
with notable changes in strategy, approach and results from the first (OP) to the second stage
(AF) mentioned where relevant.

1.1.2 The Northeast State of Pernambuco has a total population of 7.5 million, of which about
2.0 million (27%) are rural. At Appraisal of the OP in 2001, about 53% of all households
statewide - and 65% of rural families -- lived in poverty. About 29% of rural households have
income of less than one minimum salary per month (about US$58), rising to 58% at less than
two minimum salaries per month. National household data (1999) showed that about 87% of all
rural households in Pernambuco lack piped water supply, 54% were without sanitation services,
and about 20% of rural households remained without electricity, given that rural electrification
programs had been relatively active, compared to 14%, 5% and 0.8% respectively for urban
Pernambuco, and 7%, 3% and 0.9% for urban Brazil as a whole. The other previous Bank-
supported Rural Poverty Reduction Projects in the Northeast Region, including Pernambuco,
had helped to alleviate these conditions using a promising participatory, demand-driven
approach to addressing persistent poverty, but the scale of poverty in rural Pernambuco
remained a major challenge, even after their implementation.1

1.1.3 Government’s Strategy and Actions Taken. At the time of project preparation, the
Federal Government had just launched its Projeto Alvorada framework for poverty reduction
efforts in municipalities nationwide with lowest Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-
M). The Bank-supported CDD projects in the Northeast region were seen as having piloted
important delivery mechanisms which fit well with the Alvorada strategy of local empowerment
and community self-help, and the projects themselves were regarded as key components for its
implementation. The State Government of Pernambuco, had, in addition to previous projects in
the CDD series, also piloted and expanded other programs to improve socio-economic
wellbeing of rural populations including the Bank-supported Land Reform and Poverty
Alleviation Pilot Project (Nº 4147-BR) and its scale-up, the Land-based Poverty Alleviation
Project (Nº 7037-BR), both of which utilized a similar community-driven methodology. The
Government of Pernambuco also implemented programs to address the social and economic
well-being of rural populations, including the “AGENDA SOCIAL PERNAMBUCO 2000?
which focused on reducing poverty by increasing employment opportunities, providing grant-
based financing in rural areas, supporting organizations, strengthening family agriculture and
implementing housing improvement for the poorest populations.

1.1.4 Bank Involvement: The Bank has had a long association with the Northeast Region
and the State of Pernambuco, entailing regular dialogue on the overall lending program, state
sector strategies and specific operations. Pernambuco has consistently supported the
community-driven Rural Poverty Reduction Projects (currently known locally as ProRural)

1
    Reformulated Northeast Rural Development Projects (1993-1997); and Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects (1995-2004).



                                                                                                                               1
since their inception in 1995, and the State is notable for its willingness to test innovations, e.g.,
market-based land reform, fair trade initiatives, and regional integration. The Bank’s CDD
investments in Northeast Brazil are well-documented in other ICRs as well as evaluation studies
suggesting the impact and cost-effectiveness of the approach. Bank support at the time for a new
Rural Poverty Reduction Project in Pernambuco paired its knowledge of a tested and robust new
mechanism with the State’s own policies, experiences and commitment.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 As stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the OP, and reiterated in the
Project Paper for the AF, the project sought to assist the State of Pernambuco to reduce
currently high levels of rural poverty by the following sub-PDOs: (a) improving well-being and
incomes of the rural poor through better access to basic social and economic infrastructure and
services and support for productive activities, using proven community-driven development
(CDD) techniques; (b) increasing the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively
to meet own needs; 2 (c) enhancing local governance by greater citizen participation and
transparency in decision-making, through creation and strengthening of community associations
and Municipal Councils; and (d) fostering closer integration of development policies, programs
and projects at the local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to extend their role in seeking
funding, priority-setting and decision-making over resource allocation.

Key performance indicators:

Sub-PDO (a):
    number of families benefited from subproject (SP) investments;
    incremental employment generated from SP investments;
    increase in well-being and incomes of project beneficiaries; and
    increase in social welfare of rural communities.

Sub-PDO (b):
    increase in social capital index (CPI) of project Municipal Councils.

Sub- PDO (c):
    number of Municipal Councils participating in priority-setting and decision-making on
       resources; and
    allocation of project and non-project funded development activities.

Sub-PDO (d):
    increase in total project and non-project financing allocated through Municipal Council
      mechanism; and
    number of communities graduated from the program.

1.3 Revised PDO

1.3.1 The PDO was not revised under the OP or under the AF. While the key performance
indicators also remained unchanged, the target value for number of families benefited was
revised downward to 38,000 under the AF, based on the actual cost parameters under the OP.




2
 Social capital is defined, for purposes of the NE CDD projects as, “a stock of knowledge, behavioral practices and attitudes held
by the members of a social group, which guides the activities in which they participate to resolve community problems. Social
capital provides citizens with appropriate reasons and motives to act collectively on behalf of a community with which they
personally identify.? (See Van Zyl, Sonn and Costa, July 2000).



                                                                                                                                     2
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target population was the same for the OP and for the AF. The OP sought to
benefit 110,000 poor rural families (27% of Pernambuco's rural population), primarily small-
holders, tenants, sharecroppers, and landless laborers. The AF targeted an additional 38,000
families with the same profile. The project area, under the OP, covered 177 municipalities - i.e.,
all municipalities excluding seven located in Metropolitan Recife. Under both the OP and the
AF, resources were concentrated in the 109 municipalities (Area 1) with the lowest relative
Human Development Index (HDI) ranking; Area 2 comprised 68 municipalities with slightly
higher HDI-M. The AF included two newly-created municipalities under Area 1 (bringing its
total to 111), left Area 2 unchanged and explicitly allocated loan SP resources according to area
targeted. Both the OP and the AF sought the inclusion of indigenous and Afro-descendent
peoples, yet the AF was more explicit in this regard.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The total cost of the OP was US$40.0 million, of which the Bank loan financed US$30.1
million.

1.5.1 Component 1: Community Subprojects (OP -US$36.0 m., 90% total estimated cost)
financed matching grants to organized rural CAs for about 1,560 small-scale investment SPs
categorized as infrastructure, productive and social. New types of community investments were
also included, such as education, health, culture and environment. Three financing mechanisms
were available: (i) PAC, under which CAs submitted their investment proposals directly to the
State Technical Unit (STU); (ii) FUMAC, where decision-making on investment proposals was
delegated by the State to the MCs, composed predominately of CA representatives, with
participation also from civil society and municipal authorities; and (iii) FUMAC-P, under which
high-performing MCs had access to a “block grant? to finance SPs.

Component 2: Institutional Development (OP - US$2.8 m., 7% of total estimated cost)
financed technical assistance and training to build capacity of the implementing entities
including the CAs, MCs and the STU. Modest funding was also included to support state
institutional modernization and reform related to poverty reduction programs and policies.

Component 3: Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (OP -US$1.2 m.,
3% of total estimated cost) financed the costs (excluding salaries) of project administration and
coordination including supervision, monitoring and subsequent impact evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 The AF was designed to scale up financing, activities and beneficiary coverage to
strengthen the impact of the successful OP, without changing its basic design, methodology or
implementation arrangements. The cost of the AF totaled US$40.0 million, with Bank
financing of US$30.0 m. 3 Project components remained the same, with changes to relative
costs and targets drawn from experience under the OP: (i) Component 1 (US$32.9 m., 82% of
total estimated cost) would finance an additional 1,100 community SPs to benefit another
38,000 families, exclusively under the FUMAC mechanism; 4 (ii) Component 2 increased to

3
 The Federal Government approved borrowing by the State of Pernambuco for a OP with subsequent authorization to scale up,
provided project performance was satisfactory. Given strong progress under the OP, the State sought the scale-up in the full,
Federally-authorized amount of US$31.0 million for the AF.
4
  The reduced targets but same-sized loan came from a planned increased focus on productive investments - which tend to cost more
than basic infrastructure albeit benefiting fewer families - and experience with higher than expected costs per beneficiary family
under the OP.


                                                                                                                                3
US$5.4 m., 14% of total estimated cost; and (iii) Component 3 also increased to US$1.7 m., 4%
of total estimated cost. The Board approved the AF on October 5, 2006 and the loan Closing
Date was extended to January 31, 2010.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 Reallocation of Funds: There were two reallocations of funds during the Project’s
implementation:

OP: In 2005, US$8.0 m., consisting of US$6.1 m. from Category l(b) FUMAC Pilot Grants,
US$1.3 m. from Category 1(c) - PAC Grants, and US$0.6 m. from Category 5 – Unallocated,
were reallocated to Category 1(a) – FUMAC Grant (US$5.6 m.) and Category 2 - Consultants
Services and Training (US$2.4 m.).

AF: In 2009, of a reallocation of US$1.29 m., US$0.2 m. was reassigned to Category 1(a) Area
1 Grants, and US$0.4 m. to Category 1(b) Area 2 Grants. The remaining US$1.24 m. was
reallocated to Category 3(a) - Operational Costs (US$0.47 m.) and 3(b) - Project supervision
(US$0.77 m.).

1.7.2 Extension of Closing Date: From the original Closing Date of June 30, 2005, two
extensions took place under the OP: (i) to June 30, 2006 (in May 2005); and (ii) to January 31,
2007 (in June 2006). The first extension sought full disbursement of the Bank Loan financing
the OP, while the second extension provided a “bridge? from the OP to the Board presentation
of the proposed AF. The Closing Date for the AF Loan was not extended and it closed at the
end of its allotted three years.

1.7.3 Amendments to the Loan Agreement: The OP loan agreement was amended in regard
to the Closing Date extensions and reallocations previously mentioned. The AF loan agreement
was amended only in regard to the reallocation (see 1.7.1).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis:

2.1.1 The reduction of poverty and inequality were benchmarks of the Bank’s country
assistance efforts, and the Northeast region was a primary focus area for well-targeted anti-
poverty programs to improve human and physical capital. The analytical basis and justification
rested on the documented successes and lessons of similar operations across the Northeast
region, including Pernambuco, since 1993. Further, the Bank had financed studies, analytical
work, and state economic memoranda to identify the dimensions, characteristics and causes of
rural poverty and to develop strategic options for policy and programmatic actions.5 In general
terms, rural poverty is fostered by a relatively weak natural resource base vulnerability to
frequent droughts, low labor productivity, high levels of illiteracy and poor quality and coverage
of education, relatively large family size and poor access to basic infrastructure and services.
The project was seen as an instrument for intensifying the economically viable small farm sector
in the Northeast region, as a factor in stimulating growth of the rural non-farm sector and,
through the provision of basic infrastructure, as a safety net for poor rural communities in
drought-prone areas with natural resource problems.

                                                                                                                   4
2.1.2 The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 22116-BR, dated May 24, 2001, FY 01-
03) identified the reduction of poverty and inequality as central to the Bank’s assistance efforts,
and the Northeast region as a primary focus area, stressing well-targeted anti-poverty programs,
human and physical capital formation, decentralization of expenditure and implementation
responsibilities to the states and municipalities, and better integration of poverty policies and
programs to increase impact and efficiency. The OP was consistent with these higher-level CAS
objectives. The AF, in turn, was consistent with the CAS (27043-BR, dated November 10,
2003) for FY04-07, which called for successive projects under the Northeast CDD program to
finance basic infrastructure for the rural poor, support income-generation activities, and promote
closer integration of State and Federal rural initiatives in participating municipalities.6

Assessment of project design:

2.1.3 Objectives: Project objectives were rational, given the conditions on the ground in
Pernambuco, were aligned with country and sector strategies, and remained consistent with the
Borrower's rural priorities through two changes of Government and subsequent adjustments to
those strategies. The higher level PDO - not expected to be measured within the life of the
project - sought a direct impact on rural poverty through four sub-PDOs for which the project
could reasonably be held accountable. A decade of piloting, scaling up and evaluation of the
Northeast community-driven development projects provided assurance that the PDO was
achievable, albeit ambitious. The integration objective was innovative and challenging to
implement and measure, reflecting the Borrower’s interest in leveraging support for the target
population using the project's established institutional mechanisms. Objectives were considered
measurable, although income results were understood to require a longer maturation and, at end-
project, were expected to be preliminary. Overall, project objectives were consistent with the
Borrower’s known technical and institutional capacity at appraisal of both operations.

2.1.4 Indicators: Key Project Performance Indicators (KPIs) were numerous, stemming in
part from the four sub-PDOs. Due to the inherent nature of the social capital and local
governance sub-PDOs, their associated KPIs lacked a clear numerical definition. There was
some confusion in two areas: (a) graduation; and (b) separation of social well-being from social
welfare. Graduation was characterized as "communities" moved out of the "program" when
actual design called for CAs receiving a productive subproject to be graduated from further
productive matching-grants after its execution. A community can have more than one CA and a
CA can comprise just part of a community. Furthermore, the CA owns the subproject, not the
community.

2.1.5 The PAD required that a CA with one grant-financed productive subproject be
graduated to other financing for productive activities, but that CAs retained eligibility for other
types of project investments. Social well-being and income were combined in one indicator,
and social welfare was to be measured in a separate KPI. Finally, the PDO focused on
community social capital but the related KPI called for an increase in the social capital index
(SCI) of the Municipal Councils, for which there was no baseline.

2.1.6 Components and organization: Project components were few, clearly-formulated and
appropriate for achieving project objectives importantly due to their internal flexibility,
permitting innovations and additional activities within the broad outline and methodology.

2.1.7 Organization and Decentralization: The established STU, experienced and embedded
in its parent secretariat, retained its coordination role. The definition of a management model
that guaranteed efficiency with agility and responsiveness to community demands proved

6
 The Bank insisted that all investment resources secured from these complementary programs be targeted and approved using the
project’s established institutional mechanisms (i.e., CAs and MCs), thereby leveraging the project methodology within a wider set
of rural policies and programs. In practice, integration was a broader process.


                                                                                                                               5
successful. These new practices represented important advances for Project performance,
relative to the predecessor RPAP (1997-2001).

2.1.8 Project management demonstrated a high standard of transparency and commitment to
participation. This was made possible by the decentralization of project management and the
introduction of eight Regional Technical Units (RTUs) in strategic locations statewide.
Following the logic of the Regions of Development (RD), adopted by the State for its
development planning, the STU opened RTUs in Recife, Palmares, Limoeiro, Caruaru,
Garanhuns, Arcoverde, Salgueiro and Petrolina, each staffed with multidisciplinary teams.This
decentralization enabled greater flexibility in Project performance, given the RTU’s autonomy
to perform actions and procedures locally. The proximity of technical assistance also reduced
delays in SP processing and strengthened the CAs’ ability to manage their SPs. Another effect
of decentralization was enhanced SP supervision. The RTUs facilitated greater dialogue with
rural communities benefited by the project and deepened knowledge of local development
challenges and corresponding options.

2.1.9 Strategic choices: The project stimulated improvements in social welfare and local
economic activity through several strategic choices: (a) productive activities, technical
assistance and investments, in both social and economic infra-structure/services, supporting the
agricultural diversification and employment opportunities; (b) the cost-effective and responsive
community-based approach offered better prospects of sustainability; (c) boosting the capacity
of the MCs, through training and technical assistance, to engage in broader local planning
leveraging of complementary resources through integration with other programs/agencies; (d)
introduction of a graduation or exit strategy for the beneficiaries of productive investments; (e) a
more precise poverty targeting framework; (f) rigorous monitoring and evaluation; and (g)
updated information technology to increase transparency by permitting communities and the
RTUs to access project information in real time.

2.1.10 Graduation: Under previous CDD operations in Pernambuco, most of the investments
requested by the CAs comprised infrastructure SPs. Graduation was a new design element
arising from internal Bank concerns about using grant financing for productive activities. The
Bank team argued that grants were a justifiable mechanism for jump-starting income generating
activities, given the obstacles normally encountered by small, poor rural borrowers seeking
formal credit. The Bank and STU consulted during appraisal with the Bank of the Northeast and
Bank of Brazil to try and link graduating CAs to such entities through information sharing and
coordination related to group credit candidates, participation of these representatives financial
institutions at MCs meetings, and feedback to the STU by these banks on successful initial
experiences with such borrowers. The MIS was to monitor the share of rural poor that had
received grant financing for productive investments and subsequently graduated to commercial
credit.

2.1.11 All CAs with productive projects were graduated, and a great number of them, as
informed by the MCs, have the necessary infrastructure, assets, and organizational capacity to
apply for other resources and services. However, there is no evidence that during project
implementation the proposed partnership with credit institutions worked as planned. Studies
conducted under the project 7 found that some communities had access to complementary
resources which brought a comparative advantage vis-à-vis other communities without such
access.

2.1.12 Integration: Under the project the MCs were encouraged to expand their input into
broader local planning to achieve better integration of policies and programs and improve the
local impact of public resources available for poverty reduction. In fact, MCs’ participation in

                                                                                                                              6
the project proved more active and complex than was preliminarily designed, and came to be
recognized by both the local population and their elected mayors as valid representatives of
communities and civil society and as an able partner of local administration in fostering and
sustaining municipal development. The better organized MCs worked in partnership with other
government programs and projects to better articulate local actions with the full participation of
the community. The status of partnership to integrate the project with other government
programs and projects can be measured by the US$25.0 m. leveraged for water supply and
investments SPs on land reform settlements (partnership with Ministry of Social Development
(MDS) and Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA). Some examples of the integration
efforts are: (i) the agro-industry program in the Zona da Mata Region (PROMATA, SEBRAE
and the Mayors); (ii) rural school program (SERTA, Mayor and Secretary of Education); (iii)
semi-arid program; and (iv) Pesca Litoral Norte (SEBRAE, Alcoa, Comissão Pastoral de Pesca).

2.1.13 Territorial Approach - Integrated Plan for Local Development – IPLD: The
implementation of the Integrated Plan for Local Development – IPLD enabled greater
integration between investments to solve structural problems, within a broader policy
development. The IPLD incorporated linkages with other government actions that could
contribute to elevating the HDI-M of 11 municipalities located in the Development Regions of
Sertão do Moxotó and Agreste Meridional. Together, these municipalities represented the
poorest territories of the State. The IPLD methodology stressed: (i) integrated state-level action,
(ii) participatory local processes; and (iii) local implementation which put this strategy into
practice. Besides improving the HDI-M of the State’s poorest municipalities, the IPLD also
enhanced performance of the Bank-supported Project itself, by bringing in the territorial
dimension as a strategy for integrated regional productive development.

Adequacy of Government’s commitment:

2.1.14 Government was fully committed to project objectives and methodology under both the
OP and the AF. Though a potential concern at Appraisal, the State maintained adequate
counterpart funding throughout project implementation. Although changes in both the State
Government and STU had occurred during Project implementation, this did not impact
negatively on Project performance. Blanket coverage of the FUMAC subprogram under the OP
(and the elimination of PAC) further attests to the State’s resolve toward decentralized
approaches to reducing rural poverty, as did its support for the new Federal Government
programs such as Fome Zero, (Zero Hunger) Sede Zero (Zero Thirsty) and the project’s ability
to promote social integration of actions through other programs.

Risk Assessment:

2.1.15 Risks were correctly identified in the PAD based on previous experiences with similar
projects in Pernambuco and other Northeast states. However, some additional risks could have
been highlighted to allow a better appreciation of the project context and to plan appropriate
mitigation measures:

   Political change risk: Post-election State government changeover was known to be
    disruptive in Brazil, particularly in the Northeast, and effective mitigation measures were
    known from previous experience;
   Sketchy planning by MCs: Mitigation measures to ensure that the STU gave the MCs an
    annual indicative budget to support realistic investment planning could have been stronger
    given that it was an important requirement of the Operational Manual;
   Scant Technical assistance: Mitigating this risk by appointing a salaried Technical Advisor
    to each MC was sound but not implemented; in any case, this was only a partial solution to
    the pervasive issue of scant technical support in the rural Northeast;
   Project targeting risk: Targeting could have reflected the fact that the poorest rural
    communities are often the least-organized and informed, with consequent project access

                                                                                                 7
        issues. Mitigation should have called for intensive consultation, mobilization and
        organization of vulnerable populations from preparation onwards; and
       Financial management risk: Risk assessment/mitigation relating to financial management
        issues consistent with the project’s community-based nature and decentralized financial
        arrangements could have been explicitly carried out.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 Overview: Both the OP and the AF had a rapid start-up and disbursement, considering
the ample experience of the STU and its decentralization strategy, which started prior to Board
approval of the OP and consolidated during its implementation. The STU profoundly reformed
its operational structure with the strategic distribution of eight RTUs located across the State
Development Regions. This decentralization of management has enabled greater flexibility and
agility in project performance and consequently facilitating disbursements, as RTUs started to
act with autonomy from the STU in several steps for the approval of SPs. In January 2003, the
STU also underwent changes in its administrative structure based on Reform of the State
provision in Complementary Law no. 49 of January 31, 2003, which introduced a matrix
management model. The Secretariat for Planning and Social Development became the
Secretariat of Planning and the STU adopted a general manager and a manager for each
program/project under its responsibility, coordinating all action jointly with the Technical
Administration Management and with the Operational Manager. The former have a horizontal
area of action focusing on results and supporting the teams within its purview. While the
general design and objectives of the OP and AF were the same, implementation showed
distinctions (see Annex 2). The AF, besides consolidating both the ongoing management
decentralization and the experience of the IPLD, maintained its principal focus on the poorest
municipalities according to the HDI-M, and introduced a management strategy for project
implementation that took into account the territorial dimension8 linking the various social actors
who participate in the construction of local development.

Major factors affecting implementation and their resolution/outcome

2.2.2 Government turnover: During project execution the STU underwent several State
Government administrative reforms, and was transferred to different Secretariats. Despite these,
the STU was able to maintain and strengthen its field supervision teams and organizational
structure. Positive operational impacts included: (i) functional changes within the STU, with
personnel being decentralized to the RTUs for greater institutional efficiency and greater agility
in SP processing9; (ii) adoption of a territorial approach with specific focus on human and social
capital development; (iii) more intensive activities in the 110 poorest (i.e., Area 1)
municipalities; (iv) maximization of project investments and beneficiaries through the State’s
provision of counterpart funding well in excess of appraisal estimates; and (v) intense focus on
integration with other programs to leverage benefits and available resources.

2.2.3 Institutional management of community demand: Community demand for
construction of cisterns, wells and household sanitation exceeded indicative appraisal estimates.
Water infrastructure SPs drew the largest share of resources invested under Component 1. Two
factors lead to this result. First, the State’s privatization of its electrical company spurred access
in rural areas and, in fact, largely led to nearly universal access; as such, the project no longer
needed to finance such investments. Second, the State proactively partnered with Federal
programs sponsored by the Ministry of Social Development (MDS) to expand access to potable

  Of a total Team of 182 persons now, 60% are at headquarters and 40% are in the RTUs. In 2001 those percentages were 87% at
headquarter and 13% in the RTUs. The management of the project could set a mark of participation, transparency and commitment
to public interest. This work was made possible by the decentralization of project management, with the formation of the 179 MCs
and the implementation of the nine RTUs in strategic locations.

                                                                                                                              8
water, which in turn raised community demand for this type of subproject. Thus, the
construction of cisterns directly responded to community demand to minimize the effects of
water shortages and irregular rainfall. Poor rural communities, especially in the semi-arid region,
seized the opportunity under the Project to access water infrastructure and improve daily living
conditions. Investment in household cisterns was aligned with the State Government strategy to
strengthen the quality of life in the semi-arid, in conjunction with other programs and projects,
like the "One million cisterns?. Household sanitation SPs were very significant in terms of
volume as well as justified by the expected improvement in health and family living conditions.

2.2.4 Quality Mid-term Reviews (MTR): The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the OP,
conducted in 2004, confirmed that the Project was achieving its PDO. Projects investments
were visibly improving community wellbeing and living conditions and effective Project
targeting was ensuring inclusion of the poorest rural populations and their access to project
resources. There was no MTR under the AF.

2.2.5 The MTR made a series of operational recommendations for STU action; these did not
require a change to the project objectives or its components. The MTR’s principal
recommendations further improved the Project, and upgraded the STU’s preparedness for the
administrative and operational demands of a possible follow-on project with innovative features.
The main recommendations for the STU were the following:
 Organize a workshop to review with RTUs the project’s rules and parameters, with the aim
    of clarifying selected aspects of the Operational Manual;
 Continue to train the MCs for an expanded role as conduits for integrating rural public
    policies and programs;
 Mobilize and organize poor communities to foster their participation;
 Integrate project actions with other programs outside the IPLD;
 Simplify models and requirements for productive subprojects and develop a training and
    technical assistance strategy;
 Resolve the issue of very small-scale subprojects and partial community coverage in the
    case of some types of subprojects;
 Eliminate the financing of subprojects in stages; and
 Review the concept of “graduation? once CAs start to access more than one subproject.

2.2.6 Municipal Councils: Under the OP, the MCs consolidated their role as local decision-
makers. In each RTU, technical staff advised the MCs to build their capacity and strengthen
their organization. In 2004, some 32 MCs were restructured. Also under the OP, the STU
worked hard to establish 100 new MCs, resulting in 100% coverage of the Project area, greatly
exceeding the end-project goal of 130 functioning FUMAC Councils. 10 MC formation was
supported by a strong training program and by the continued strengthening of the STU and the
RTUs with adequate qualified technical staffing capable of assisting the newly formed MCs.

2.2.7 The FUMAC – P program, (the most decentralized delivery mechanism delivery under
the OP) showed neither satisfactory performance in resource management nor adequate
participation of local government. Thus, the STU concluded that SPs and CAs could be better
served under the FUMAC mechanism and therefore opted to implement the OP (and, in
succession, the AF) exclusively through this mechanism. Overall, the CAs’ participation in the
MCs has changed traditional patterns of social control, creating an emerging rural citizenry that
is learning to live on different terms and refusing to conform to social and cultural patterns




10
    The goal of a total of 130 councils functioning at the end of OP implementation of RPRP had been largely achieved within the
first five months of OP implementation.

                                                                                                                              9
previously constructed for them. 11 Women and youth have also substantially increased their
participation in the MCs12 and on CA administration.

2.2.8 To provide overhead for MC maintenance, a management fee was established,
amounting to 1% of SP cost. The MCs with higher levels of organization have sought to work in
partnership with other programs and projects by integrating and disseminating information in
order to capture and leverage these complementary resources.

2.2.9 Under the AF, the STU consolidated the MCs, making them entities capable of
engaging across a broader set of public policies, thereby enhancing and diversifying civic
involvement (i.e., attracting the active participation of ethnic groups, young, women and elderly
people) to occupy spaces of decision-making and influence in the formulation and
implementation of development policies and joint partnerships. The MCs became independent
legal entities and their restructuring included the following: (i) capacity building for
development management; (ii) diagnosis and participatory planning; (iii) articulation of public
offerings of programs with local demands; and (iv) encouraging entrepreneurship.

2.2.10 This process led to the unification of the two municipal-level Councils across
Pernambuco: (i) the Municipal Council for Rural Development (CMDR) created by municipal
law, with equal composition and tasked with the deliberation of resources under the National
Program for Family Agriculture (PRONAF); and (ii) FUMAC Municipal Councils (i.e., MCs),
which are nonprofit entities with 80% majority representative of potential project beneficiaries
and civil society, and 20% of municipal authorities and other entities; deliberated the resources
of ProRural. To date, 98% of these councils have been unified. The consolidated councils
retained the CMDR label, which now has 80% majority representation of the CAs and family
agriculture cooperatives, and 20% of the government (municipal authorities) and others entities
of the civil society with the responsibility to discuss and deliberate the actions and resources of
ProRural and of others partners of sustainable rural development. These MCs are now well
placed to serve as ample forums for participation and social control of rural public policies.

2.2.11 The main advances in the trajectory of these consolidated MCs13 are:
 Greater organizational effectiveness;
 Discussion and systematic monitoring of rural policies and development programs;
 Creation of chambers or thematic groups to better develop such actions;
 Expansion of MC composition and representation to increase participation of both rural and
    urban associations, including indigenous peoples and Quilombolas;
 Building consensus among different political groups;
 Unification of purpose among the previously separate entities;
 Expansion of new issues in the public policy debate;
 Effective participation of other entities, beyond ProRural, at MC meetings; and
 Greater visibility among governmental and nongovernmental organizations.

2.2.12 Partnerships and Integration: The project benefited from strong and ever growing
support from many capable and effective NGOs and technical assistance groups. The STU,
under both in OP and AF, developed a comprehensive network of partnerships and integrated
with other programs and projects. In addition to federal programs14, the STU forged partnerships



11
   The FECAMP Study supports this finding stating, “Project mechanisms gave expanded space for local participation and partially
defused the direct power of local political actors, such as the mayors. Even when the mayors are a notable presence, the exercise of
power via the MCs implies changes in attitudes, and redefined strategies and priorities whose positive effects cannot be ignored.?
12
   Some MCs, as Ipubi, Bodocó and Granite, as many others were chaired by women.

    The results obtained from the Program strategy with the MCs have had repercussions in neighboring States and become a
reference in the exchanges carried with them.

for specific tasks within the State Government15 and also with private institutions. 16 Municipal
government participation was also significant in complementary actions and investments, and in
leveraging financial and technical support for the SPs. These partnerships were fundamental for
sound Project execution and management. There was strong NGO involvement during Project
implementation, particularly in SP preparation, technical assistance and CA capacity building.
The STU also established a partnership with the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on
Agriculture (IICA) via a Technical Cooperation Plan, under which it contracted technicians and
consultants to develop various activities related to the Project.

2.2.13 Productive Subprojects: Productive SP demand was thin under the OP (only about 2%
of total SP demand). The OP financed 21 productive SPs (about 1% of total SPs). The STU
adopted a cautious posture regarding productive SPs under the OP, applying rigorous criteria in
their technical, economic, financial and environmental analyses, due to difficulties and limited
success with these SPs under the predecessor project (i.e., RPAP, 1997-2001).17 Considering the
high CA interest in employment and income generation, and also because in the two first years
of the OP, so few productive SPs were financed, the Bank supervision team recommended that
the STU assess the viability of networking the productive SPs, in order to create the conditions
necessary to leverage the demand and consequently the financing of more such investments.

2.2.14 The volume of productive SPs increased significantly under the AF (24% of total SPs),
a direct result of intensified action by new STU management to improve SP preparation and
monitoring. These actions were under the responsibility of the “Center for Support to
Productive Subprojects – NAP. The interdisciplinary NAP team ensured the economic and
technical feasibility of SPs, factors that definitively contributed to the success of the investment.
Agricultural mechanization (e.g. tractor and equipment) dominated productive SPs, under both
the OP and AF. SPs financed under the AF were mostly in support of production, such as farm
machinery, basic grain processing and milk coolers As a whole, the great majority of productive
SPs were rated highly by the beneficiaries.18 Beside tractors, there were many other examples
of successful small-scale enterprises in beekeeping, fruit production and processing, milk
processing and other activities, providing important lessons for wide spill-over.

2.3        Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Management Information System: Project data collection and analysis depended on a
Management Information System (MIS). Although the MIS had functioned well under the
previous Project (RPAP, 1997-2001), it presented some shortcomings such as: (i) inability to
monitor and register leveraged (i.e., non-project) resources from partnerships with others
programs; (ii) specific tracking of the share of rural poor receiving grant financing for
productive SPs; and (iii) CA graduation to commercial credits. As such, the MIS was updated
and important features were included in its structure to better monitor and record data
concerning Project implementation, particularly for SP management by the decentralized RTUs.
The MIS consisted of three modules: (i) registration SP demand and proposals; (ii) monitoring


15
   Water Resources Secretariat (outorga onerosa) CPRH (environmental license), PROMATA (businesses operator - support the
communities associations in “Zona da Mata? for qualification of products, production and producers and also search for new
markets) IPA (preparation of subprojects, technical and managerial assistance to community associations), FUNDARPE and CEPIR
(cultural activities and training with the ethnic groups indigenous and quilombolas).
16
   Private companies - such as Parmalat, Batavo, Nutrir – in buying products resulting from production of the milk chain creating
other alternatives beyond the institutional purchases.
17
   According to Simeon Nichter Study,: “Productive Investments in Pernambuco?, the difficulties in productive subprojects comes
from the lack of training and technical assistance to the communities that haves as consequences: (i) some subprojects never started
considered no training was available to solve their initial problems; (ii)without training some subprojects had difficulties in use the
purchased equipments; (iii) communities with subproject that involve animals could lose their herbs if they weren`t prepare do deal
with diseases and eating habits.
18
   Impact phrases mentioned by the beneficiaries: (i) “The producer only started to like of milk after we had the subproject? ; (ii)
“Today we are sure we are selling milk with quality?. (iii) “Work with the hoe wasn`t life?; (iv) “(iii) Our tractor is the worker
Fortão that came to help us - The meaning of this acquisition for the life of the farmers, and what the equipment is for those people
is expressed in the care shown for him and lovely nickname it has received: Fortão.

                                                                                                                                   11
of SP approvals; and (iii) SP supervision. Furthermore, the MIS was transformed into a web
environment in order to facilitate public access to information on project implementation.

2.3.2 The MIS is accessible online by all the RTUs as well as the STU located in Recife.
This allows local data entry for CAs and SPs and the real-time monitoring of the entire SP cycle.
The MIS includes community profile variables, integrated financial management data with a
greater physical reporting capability, and online connectivity between the RTUs and the STU to
strengthen decentralized data collection and a real-time field data entry. A link on the ProRural
website allows registered users to access the MIS and select the variables they wish to be export
to a specific report. The MIS is dynamic and can generate relevant and timely information for
the full breadth of users in ProRural, thereby enhancing the capacity to effectively monitor and
supervise SPs. The MIS generates measures for Key Performance Indicators to accompany
physical and financial Project performance, but could be further improved with the inclusion of
modules and associated reports containing indicators that currently are not reported regularly,
e.g., jobs created, number of women, communities benefited, SP economic efficiency.

2.3.3 Evaluation studies: Under the OP, the Project financed several studies, including a
baseline and immediate results study (FECAMP 2004). This study was expected to be followed
up by a second round of field survey with purpose of estimating Project impact evaluation. By
the time the second round was to take place, three events led to its postponement: (i) an AF loan
had been approved by the Bank’s Board; (ii) changes in State and Project administrations; and
(iii) protracted delays in the competitive contracting of the follow-up study. It was then decided
to use the existing baseline and proceed with the second round follow-up during AF
implementation. In exchange, the STU carried out other studies of OP implementation, such as:
(i) “Productive Investments In Pernambuco? (Nichter 2003) and (ii) a Physical Performance
Study (CEPLAN 2004).

2.3.4 Under the AF, the STU’s concerns were mainly associated with: (i) MC reorganization
in line with the territorial development approach; (ii) ProRural staffing – including the RTUs;
(iii) actual Project implementation; and (iv) definition of a sound approach for the productive
SPs. These concerns, coupled with an apparent low appreciation of the Project´s administration
for a formal impact evaluation study (despite the Bank team’s persistence in recommending the
follow-up evaluation), led to the STU decision to conduct other studies in lieu of the second
round of impact surveys, among them: (i) Diagnosis of the productive SPs (Associação
Politécnica de Consultoria 2009); (ii) Case study SP analysis (Simões 2010); and (iii) a series
of case studies to estimate economic and financial estimates of the project. Annex 5 summarizes
these studies; detailed economic and financial estimates are found in Annex 3.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards. The project was a Category B, with an Environmental Management Plan
(EMP). The STU created a Technical, Environmental and Social Review Committee, to analyze
SPs for consistent compliance with the Operational Manual, which included the Bank’s
Environmental and Social Safeguards. The STU also maintained an environmental specialist as
part of its analytical team and was committed and equipped to handle an intensified
environmental approach. The STU applied, systematically and routinely, a set of environmental
safeguard practices and procedures for SPs throughout both OP and AF implementation. No SP
agreement was signed or funds were transferred until the SP environmental viability was
determined in order to: (i) insure compliance with relevant State and Federal environment laws
and Bank Safeguards; (ii) consolidate the applications/integration of environmental standards in
financed SPs; (iii) promote convergence between rural poverty reduction and environmental
conservation/valuation; and (iv) initiate linkages between conservation and protection activities




                                                                                               12
and actual SPs. When necessary, the Environmental License and the Water “outorga? licenses
were issued by the relevant State agency.19

2.4.2 Indigenous Peoples Participation Framework 20 : For the Project, indigenous
beneficiaries comprised 1% of all beneficiaries, a figure roughly proportional to the distribution
of the indigenous population within the State’s rural population. Under the OP, some 1,700
indigenous people (or some 7% of the total indigenous population in Pernambuco) implemented
SPs, primarily for housing rehabilitation and rural water systems. The Project sought to create
opportunities for indigenous communities to identity and execute small-scale community
investments through their own associations, consistent with their unique socio-ethnic
characteristics. Under the AF, the Project expanded its assistance to indigenous communities
through coordinated actions with other governmental and non-governmental agencies; nine SPs
were financed for indigenous groups and those investments benefited about 700 families (3,083
people). 21 Forum and training activities benefited indigenous peoples. A partnership with
APOINME (Articulação dos Povos e Organizações Indígenas do Nordeste, Minas Gerais e
Espirito Santo) strengthened existing and nascent indigenous organizations. In 2008, the Project
held a workshop in the municipality of Ibimirim for eleven indigenous groups to review the
year’s activities and plan future actions until project closing.

2.4.3 Financial Management. Financial management performance was generally satisfactory
throughout Project implementation. The same financial management system was used under
both the OP and the AF, with key improvements introduced under the OP and updated under the
AF. Financial management supervision missions consistently rated the project Satisfactory, with
the exception of a downgrade to Unsatisfactory in June 2003, due to cross-country fiscal
constraints at that time affecting most of the Bank’s Brazil portfolio. The overall result of the
final financial management supervision (April 2010) was positive and concluded that the STU’s
financial management arrangements were Satisfactory. The FM risk associated with the project
remains Moderate.

2.4.4 Audit. Audit performance was generally Satisfactory. Auditors’ opinions were
consistently unqualified for Financial Statements and Special Opinions. Management Letters
(Carta Gerencial) found the project's internal control systems to be Satisfactory. The Bank team
followed up closely with the Borrower on auditors' recommendations and there were no audit
issues pending at closing of either the OP or the AF.

2.4.5 Procurement. Procurement Post-Review (PPR) missions generally rated procurement
risk as average and overall procurement performance as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory.
A recurring issue was the STU's lack of technical and administrative capacity in the selection
and procurement of consultants (both individuals and firms). Detailed recommendations were
made by the Bank during the AF, among these the contracting of a procurement specialist well-
versed in Bank procedures to speed up both processing and to train the STU's procurement team,
and greater use of the project MIS as a procurement aid. STU performance has improved in this
regard, in advance of the proposed next-generation operation of the State.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Transition arrangements to regular operations in the context of the Northeast CDD
projects mean: (i) SP execution; (ii) its formal release to the beneficiary CA - which, with some
exceptions such as rural electrification systems, legally owns the investment; and (iii) its
19
     The environmental license was furnished by the CPRH and the water “outorga? by Water Resources Secretariat.
20
     Under the OP there was no IPPF, as it was not a requirement at the time Board Approval in 2001.

21
   Total indigenous population in Pernambuco is estimated at 20,000, or about 1% of the rural population. Total indigenous
beneficiaries (nearly 4,800 people) are also about 1% of total beneficiaries under the OP and AF.



                                                                                                                             13
operation under pre-established rules and procedures agreed under contract between the CA and
STU.

2.5.2 Operation and Maintenance: The responsibility for SP operation and maintenance can
be attributed to three different actors: (i) CAs, when the SP is for collective use, (ii) families
benefited when the civil work and/or equipment under the SP is used exclusively by the
beneficiary family; and (iii) public organizations, when municipal governments or
concessionaires of the state government assume SP management after its implementation. O&M
performance under the Project was good and the sustainability outlook is positive. O&M
procedures were mandatory in SP proposals and mandatory criteria for their approval. Technical
assistance for designing O&M under the SPs was generally available. Several project studies
suggest that the importance of O&M is well-understood by communities. Norms and procedures
are in place for productive SPs, including payment of user fees and building of maintenance
funds for equipment depreciation. Sustainability of SPs is satisfactory, with user fees being paid
where relevant. After reaching access to basic infrastructure (water, electricity) communities are
moving on to income generating activities – some communities are already reaching national
and international markets.

2.5.3 Next Phase: The State is already mainstreaming the project mechanisms, procedures
and standards into its regular rural poverty reduction programs and will continue to finance
similar activities with its own funds. The State has received Federal Government approval to
proceed with the preparation and subsequent negotiation of a new, larger and quite different
rural program which stresses: (i) economic inclusion of smallholder agriculture; (ii) rural
competitiveness; (iii) improved productive use of water resources; and (iv) scaling up of
regional development initiatives (including public/private partnerships).

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High overall relevance

3.1.1 Project development objectives remain relevant and continued to be consistent with the
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 42667-BR, 2008-2011, discussed by the Board in May
2008; Progress Report April 2010), explicitly via the challenge of reducing endemic poverty in
Brazil’s Northeast region through economic inclusion to strengthen communities' productive
potential and activities to foster their economic integration. Basic infrastructure delivered cost-
effectively to poor rural communities is essential for productive activity, as is the social capital
formation promoted by the project's participatory institutions, i.e., CAs, MCs, and by the design
of the SP cycle itself whereby CAs prepare, implement, operate and maintain their own
investments. The integration objective has high potential to boost impact and be a key element
in regional/territorial approaches to scaling-up productive activities. Project design remains
relevant and appropriate for these objectives, and demonstrates flexibility to incorporate
innovative elements as needed.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 Data provided in this ICR are derived from diverse sources. Results from various
studies show that project objectives were achieved or have high potential for achievement, and
that outcomes were positive.      Results of key project-financed studies are summarized in
Annexes 3 and 5.

Objective 1: Improving wellbeing and incomes of the rural poor through better access to basic
social and economic infrastructure and services and support for productive activities, using
proven community-driven development techniques.

                                                                                                 14
3.2.2 This objective was partially achieved:
 In aggregate, using established community-driven demand and allocation mechanisms, the
    project financed 2,284 community subprojects benefiting 96,400 families or around 424,000
    people (65% of aggregate OP/AF target). Basic socio-economic infrastructure/services
    comprised 59% of total SPs, among these: (i) 1,172 water supply SPs, including simple
    systems with household connections, domestic cisterns and wells; (ii) 629 household
    sanitation SPs; and (iii) 154 productive SPs including tractor, agro processing and irrigation.
 Some 86% of beneficiary families surveyed by FECAMP (2004) reported improved
    wellbeing, citing: family health/hygiene benefits, material living conditions (housing quality,
    sanitation access, and durable goods ownership), and food access and quality. Some 45% of
    families had gained access to clean reliable water supply and over 70% had access to
    electricity. Safe water access had reduced water-borne diseases by 50% while 73% of
    respondents reported increased physical comfort from regular water access. About 20% of
    families noted increased agricultural production, especially from access to small-scale
    community reservoirs. These results were confirmed by evaluations cited in Annex 3 and 5.
 The quality of life gains for 73% of beneficiary families: improved health conditions (53%),
    conditions of comfort in the home (45%), quality of food consumed (26%) and quantity of
    food consumed (22%).
 Importantly, benefits were being delivered to the project's targeted cohort of very poor
    rural families with exceptionally low average family income and high adult illiteracy.
 Employment generation: Productive SPs alone generated an estimated 11,000 jobs in
    agricultural mechanization, agroindustry, basic grain processing and fish farming.
 Results on income, health, quality of housing and access to services:
    - Incomes: Preliminary incomes results showed an average 22% increase from August
        2003 - July 2004, with income from agricultural and livestock production up 50% and
        40% respectively, from consumption of own production up 53%, and from work off-
        farm up 27%.         Some 35% of respondents reported better household subsistence
        conditions and 25% reported that SPs helped them to earn more money; for
        infrastructure subprojects, these figures were 32% and 52%, respectively.
    - Housing conditions: The percentage of rural houses with bathrooms increased from
        32% to 60%, while the use of septic tanks rose from 7% to 22%. The proportion of
        families living in improved houses climbed from 79% to 94%.
    - Access to electricity and water: Access to electricity made it possible for almost 100%
        of the beneficiaries to use electric domestic appliances – refrigerators being particularly
        important to improving and diversifying the family diet.
 Evaluation (Simões 2009) confirmed earlier indications for income: Some productive
    activities generated an average income increase of 50% and the same percentage in terms of
    productivity.

Objective 2: Increasing the social capital of rural communities to organize collectively to meet
own needs.

3.2.3 This objective was achieved:
 Some 98% of beneficiaries surveyed agreed that their subproject was good for the
    community, and 86% confirmed that the investment was the community's top priority Many
    CAs were still meeting monthly, motivated by their initial SP to present new demands: 90%
    in 2004, and this average continued throughout project implementation. Overall, community
    participation in CAs and collective decision-making had grown.
 Contribution of the subproject to the association. Household surveys and field observations
    reveal that over 85% of beneficiaries agreed that SP execution contributed to unify the
    community and 90% the interviewees reported that the SPs encouraged the participation of
    members during implementation and afterward.



                                                                                               15
   Some 16% of CA members interviewed had established links with other associations and
    regularly conducted some form of joint activity with them -- important indicators of
    sustainability. Around 51% of the CAs interviewed reported that members participate in
    other Municipal-level organizations.
   The Project has been instrumental in the formation of a dense network of community
    associations as evidenced by the number of families joining and participating in organized
    civil society, the intensity of this participation and the increasing number of such
    associations representing the rural poor in local policy. By end-Project, around 3,500 CAs
    had been established directly through project activities, and an equal number of
    communities had gone through preliminary mobilization activities positioning them to
    conceive, discuss and submit a proposal whether that proposal was ultimately under the
    Bank-supported project or outside, by another programs.
   A high percentage of community leaders interviewed valued the project for the
    organizational stimulus it provided, and these leaders themselves were cited by community
    members as the main catalyst in forming an association, with union leaders, local elected
    officials and the mayors also described as influential.
   CAs and MCs were viewed as inclusive, participatory and democratic institutions.
    Associations' institutional capacity to represent the community and resolve its problems was
    rated highly in 80% of cases, with CAs seen as influential in community life.
   Associations' growing strength and role in the Municipal Councils had markedly changed
    relations between rural communities and State authorities as measured by the rise in
    municipal authorities' responsiveness to community demands: 88% of CA members
    reported that the MCs represent an advance in the representation of their communities’
    interests and some 65% cites strengthened CA relations with municipal government.
   The change in structural social capital occurs more intensively in communities which have
    implemented SPs. Studies and survey evaluated the legitimacy of the CAs under the Project
    and observed a unidirectional transformation in them over the time; these representative
    bodies are successful in significantly reducing intended manipulation by local, traditional
    political elites and strengthening their sense of civic duty.
   Beneficiary CAs, when compared with non-beneficiary CAs, are more capable of: (i)
    resolving internal conflicts; (ii) responding to communal demands; (iii) effectively
    advocating for their membership; (iv) solving local problems for the community; and (v)
    mobilizing financing and human resources.
   Evaluation (FECAMP 2004) confirmed social capital impact and found that the evolution of
    “shared public administration? increased solidarity, confidence, and leveraged additional
    funds from other programs. FECAMP stated, “looked at from a longer-term perspective,
    there can be no doubt that there has been notable construction of social capital in the
    poorest rural communities, and that [the Project]is making a positive contribution to this
    transformation?.
   The field visits and case studies (2010) indicate the project’s positive impact on social
    capital formation, a crucial project objective. Nurtured through the CAs and MCs, social
    capital is displayed in social solidarity, confidence, mutual cooperation, linkages/access to
    diverse institutions and to the resources and information of a range of assistance programs
    outside the Bank-supported Project.

Objective 3: Enhancing local governance by greater citizen participation and transparency in
decision-making, through creation and strengthening of community associations and Municipal
Councils.

3.2.4 This objective was achieved:
 101 new MCs were created, resulting in the virtual blanket coverage of the project area (179
    municipalities) – greatly exceeding the end-project goal of 130 (OP).
 98% of the MCs were strengthened and/or restructured to improve representation, overall
    function, targeting and decision-making.

                                                                                              16
    179 MCs established and deciding use/allocations.
    Rationalization in the use of public resources. 179 MCs established deciding on the
     use/allocations of funds to 100% of SPs, starting with community prioritization.
    The project established and trained an additional 2,116 CAs (over baseline), all of which
     are by definition, members of the 179 participatory MCs. All CAs with approved SPs
     (2,284) received training in diverse subjects designed to promote participation, transparent
     decision-making and effective investment management.
    While MCs' level of sophistication and maturity varied, an increasing number were
     routinely discussing a range of public programs and issues affecting rural life, e.g.,
     employment, youth migration, and natural resource issues. About 70% of MCs were
     actively seeking resource leveraging opportunities for member associations under the
     project's integration goals.
    Surveys showed that CAs saw their MCs as links to the State Government and as sources of
     information, highlighting the need for MCs to stay well-informed about project rules,
     objectives and responsibilities, and especially about criteria for the selection and priority
     ranking of community demands.
    The MCs became more autonomous, less subject to political interference, open to debate
     and proposals on a wide range of topics, and undertook participatory budgeting, include
     broad representation across rural urban, indigenous and gender.

Objective 4: Fostering closer integration of development policies, programs and projects at
the local level, by assisting Municipal Councils to extend their role in seeking funding, priority-
setting and decision-making over resource allocation.

3.2.5 This objective was achieved:
 The project leveraged some US$25 m. under its integration objective.22 This represented
    resources leveraged through high-level formal partnerships established by the STU with
    MDS (US$11 m.), MDA (US$ 8 m.) and FUNASA (US$3.5 m.).
 MCs were trained to take on integration activities. At Project closing, about 70% of the
    more advanced MCs were actively deliberating the resources from other programs.
 An agreement with various NGOs guaranteed the restructuring of the MCs under the OP
    and training of 3,000 counselors in the themes of management, role and attributions of these
    Councils.
 The Regional Meetings played a key role in strengthening the MCs and creating a space for
    structured discussions. The counselors have become more prepared to guide the MCs and
    discuss with the government and non-governmental agents their demands and priorities.
    Some 3,487 people participated of these events.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 An economic and financial analysis was performed based on data from case studies for
the most commonly demanded subprojects. The major findings are found in see Annex 3.

3.3.2. A sample was taken of 29 subprojects financed and implemented under the project (14 of
water supply; 8 of home sanitation; 3 of honey production and 4 of farm tractor). Statistical
extrapolations for the entire universe of subprojects financed were not intended, but there was a
certain comfort level with the results obtained for four reasons: (i) the apparent homogeneity
(i.e., representativeness) of the units comprising the universe by type of subproject; (ii) the
intentional decision to include subprojects considered by knowledgeable people to be
moderately successful, that is, the sampled units were not limited exclusively to very
successful subprojects; (iii) the STU took care to select subprojects considered “typical?; and
(iv) the communities composing the sample were geographically-dispersed.

22
  The Project Paper for the Additional Financing cites a ratio of 1:4 already achieved under the original project and a goal of 1:7 for
the Additional Financing. Evidence for the former is unavailable and the latter target was unrealistic.

                                                                                                                                   17
3.3.3. Net present values (NPV), benefit/costs ratios (B/C) and Internal Rates of Return (IRR)
for each subproject type sampled were estimated. Cost and benefits streams were built on the
basis of actual field data collected. IRRs were estimated using a 10-year period and the NPV
was calculated using a 10% discount rate. Two IRRs were estimated: (i) IRR-1, using actual
average values of the variables defined (see below) to measure costs and benefits; and (ii) IRR-
2, reflecting a sensitivity analysis by assuming 20% higher costs and a simultaneous 20%
reduction in revenues/benefits. Results are given in Table 1.

Table 1: Financial analysis of most commonly financed subprojects
 Type of subroject    PV Benefits (R$) PV Costs (R$) B/C ratio               IRR-1       IRR-2
 Water supply                   488,334         101,209      4.83             83%         53%
 Home sanitation                126,049         140,202      1.11             11%          8%
 Farm tractor                   597,726         245,622      2.43             61%         39%
 Honey production               717,152         349,475      2.05             82%         54%

3.3.4. The evidence suggests that financial returns are robust for water supply, honey
production and processing, and farm tractor, even under very conservative assumptions (shown
by the sensitivity analysis – IRR-2). Regarding water supply (as shown in other studies such as
Binswanger 2005) and home sanitation, their positive impact on beneficiaries’ wellbeing is
widely recognized, despite the inability to fully quantify this impact in this exercise. The
approach here seems to yield very high financial returns for water supply investments and much
lower, although positive, for home sanitation investments. These investments are mainly
justified by their wellbeing impact.

3.3.5. Additionally, financial returns are compared for four types of subprojects, common and
similar in seven individual States with RPRPs. Results indicate that Pernambuco is faring quite
well in water supply, farm tractor and honey production and processing subprojects. When
compared with results obtained by van Zyl et al. for all ten Northeast states, Pernambuco
currently performs higher on two comparable types of subprojects: farm tractor and honey
production (Table 2).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1 The overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory is justified based on:
 Original and continuing relevance of project objectives and design to the needs of the rural
    sector in Pernambuco and the wider Northeast region;
 Attainment of only 65% of aggregate OP/AF target for beneficiary families;
 Satisfactory outcomes for most project development objectives substantiated by several full-
    scale evaluations/other studies of beneficiary wellbeing, employment, incomes and social
    capital formation;
 Preliminary indications of SP economic and financial efficiency and sustainability;


                                                                                                  18
   Evidence of substantial institutional development in MCs and CAs;
   Strong evidence of physical sustainability of financed investments through completion,
    operation and O&M rates and practices; and
   Successful integration experience by leveraging an additional US$ 25 m.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty impact: The project impact on rural poverty reduction is suggested by project
studies showing improved family income and wellbeing. The dominance of water supply
investments has positioned a large number of poor rural families for more complex productive
activities in the future. Social capital formation has also prepared beneficiaries to demand access
to a range of Federal and State programs. Their organizational levels and membership in MCs
increase their potential to receive and benefit from other services, programs and policies.

3.5.2 Targeting: The Project was accurately targeted. FECAMP results demonstrated that
beneficiaries conformed to the intended project profile. FECAMP assessed the ex-ante status of
beneficiary communities at Project entry in terms of education, housing, employment, living
conditions, household assets and income. The analysis of the conditions of the target
communities and the socioeconomic profile of beneficiaries confirms that the Project reached
poor communities and extremely poor families, including particularly those beneficiaries
subject to food insecurity.

3.5.3 FECAMP (2004) found that the living conditions and socioeconomic status of
beneficiary families confirmed their extreme poverty and that part of this population suffers
food/nutritional deficits. The study also found that the municipalities with lowest HDI-M,
between 0.467 and 0.598, in the OP, received proportionately greater volumes of project
resources. This is also confirmed by end-of-project analysis of MIS output on SP distribution
according to Area 1 and Area 2 targeting, as laid out in the PAD and PP. The 2004 study also
estimated the scope of the project in terms of the total population of rural poor, concluding that
10% of poor rural families of the State were directly assisted by the project; the 97,000 families
benefited by end-of-project constitute in excess of 20% of the rural population of Pernambuco.
Since 70% of the rural population of Pernambuco is below the poverty line, project reach is very
significant in absolute and relative terms.

3.5.4 Gender and Youth: Women's direct involvement in CA leadership gained traction over
time, particularly under the AF, due to the STU’s vigorous mobilization strategy. The Project
demonstrated the capacity of the Northeast CDD model to both include and empower women,
contrary to the view that women participate but have no power. Under the OP, 24% of all CAs
were led by women, while under the AF the percentage was 32%. About 16% of MCs had
women in leadership roles and about 20% of all MCs had women as Presidents. A partnership
was established with the State Secretariat of Women, which resulted in the STU's contribution
to the construction of the 1st State Plan of Policies for Rural Women of Pernambuco. There
was a strong emphasis on ensuring women’s participation in training events and in delivering
technical assistance to female-headed subprojects, especially productive SPs. Women’s
leadership positions in the CAs and MCs also implied their automatic inclusion in special forms
of training required to fulfill those roles.

3.5.6 Regarding the inclusion of young people, the STU partnered with the State Secretariat
of Youth and promoted workshops and seminars to discuss public policies for the rural youth. A
strong partnership was established with the NGO Serviços de Tecnologia Alternativa (SERTA)
which contributed to promote local development. This partnership brought greater integration of
young people in search of better living conditions for their families and communities.


                                                                                                19
3.5.7 Ethnic Groups: Quilombola (Afro-descendent) and Indigenous People communities
benefited from project investments. The Project extended to historically excluded Quilombolas
and indigenous communities the same opportunities given to other communities. Under the OP
and the AF, around US$ 845,159 were invested in 14 subprojects of water infrastructure
(cisterns and wells) for Quilombolas, benefiting 731 families (3,216 people) in 13
municipalities covering the regions of the Sertão, Agreste Setentrional e Meridional. 59% of the
resources invested were concentrated in Agreste Meridional e Sertão do Moxotó regions where
municipalities with the lowest HDI-M are situated. The US$25 m. leveraged under the project
includes a JSDF grant of US$650,000 to empower poor and remote Quilombola communities in
Pernambuco by building their social capital and facilitating their access to existing public and
private resources.

3.5.8 The same strategy was used for indigenous peoples. The STU partnered with the
National Indigenous Foundation (FUNAI) and, under the OP, some 1,700 indigenous people (or
some 7% of the total indigenous population in Pernambuco) implemented SPs in housing
rehabilitation and rural water systems. The Project sought to create opportunities for indigenous
communities to identity and execute small-scale SPs through their own associations, consistent
with their unique socio-ethnic characteristics. Under the AF, an additional nine SPs were
financed for indigenous groups, benefitting about 700 families (3,083 people).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.9 Both the OP and the AF financed a massive amount of training, the impact of which on
the MCs and CAs was largely positive. The STU is an experienced body with a professional and
stable technical and administrative core team. Its decentralized management mode, including
the eight RTUs, encouraged community involvement in the selection and definition of priority
actions, project execution and management of public funds.

3.5.10 The STU was able to build a pattern of management that features the integration,
transparency and capacity for joint action. This pattern is responsible for its performance in
project implementation financed by international organizations, and is an example of the
possibility of building within the public structure, a management system capable of realizing
great challenges.

3.5.11 Evidence of its institutional development can be seen in its ability to surmount the
difficulties associated with government turnover, navigate shifting rural strategies, embrace
innovation, coordinate a complex series of institutional partnerships on behalf of the project,
while maintaining the pace of disbursements in a timely manner and proactively support
leveraging of additional resources.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.12 As with its predecessor (RPAP, 1997-2001), the project became a vehicle for important
innovations including: (i) the Comércio Solidário (Fair Trade) program promoting sales of
small-farm products to national and international markets; (ii) the implementation of a territorial
development strategy; (iii) development of the Integrated Plan of Local Development (IPLD) to
support local development; (iv) management decentralization; (v) engagement with Quilombola
(Afro-descendent communities) and Indigenous People through educational/cultural
consultation and outreach programs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 The project financed a survey-based baseline evaluation for impact assessment under
the OP, two survey-based Physical Performance Studies (OP and AF), several sets of case


                                                                                                20
studies and a Borrower Completion Report (OP and AF). The following briefly summarizes key
findings of the four evaluations with a more detailed presentation in Annex 5 and Annex 3.

3.6.2 FECAMP (2004): This baseline/evaluation covered three Northeast States - Ceará,
Pernambuco and Bahia. In Pernambuco, the study includes a survey of direct information in 50
communities and 61 SPs that benefited 8,602 families. The control group comprised 493
families. The evaluation confirmed that 70% of the rural population was below the poverty line,
with a profile showing extreme poverty and deprivation. Access to basic services was low; adult
illiteracy was high. The study showed that the rural population of Pernambuco (under the OP)
earned an average income some 5% below the poverty line. This study had a galvanizing effect
on the project by showing that the poorest segments of the rural population, those with lowest
IDH-M, were being reached as planned. Case studies included in this evaluation showed that
86% of beneficiaries had significantly improved living conditions from 2000 (pre-project) to
2002/2003. Income results were promising and a range of variables was very positive for social
capital gains.

3.6.3 CEPLAN (2004). This Physical Performance Study used quantitative and qualitative
data for SPs implemented under the OP. The survey was conducted in 50 municipalities across
the 12 administrative regions of Pernambuco. It covered 92 communities and 619 families;
2,863 beneficiaries were interviewed. For 30% of these families, the annual income was less
than half the official minimum salary. For 21% of families, total household income was
approximately one salary. Most of the CAs interviewed (91%) reported improvement in the
quality of life of the population, while 83% confirmed a positive vision for the use and benefits
of the SPs. 87% noted that both benefits and subproject size conformed to their expectations.
Beneficiary families and the CAs had a positive outlook on project performance. Better
knowledge on the part of beneficiaries about the project and its operation had a positive
influence on their priority-setting. The option for decentralized management of the project was
perceived as a very positive point for achieving the PDO.

3.6.4 POLICONSULT (2009). The report diagnosed the productive SPs implemented under
the OP and the AF. Data were collected for 300 subprojects in 114 municipalities. The research
sought to determine the current status of these SPs. The report concluded that these SPs had
significant impact on the beneficiaries’ quality of life, although this did not always translate into
increased income. There were direct and positive effects with the generation of employment
opportunities, improved infrastructure and the incorporation of social roles by the beneficiaries.

3.6.5 Physical Performance Study – Pereira and Gonçalves (2010). The study conducted
an ex-post evaluation of SP physical implementation, which was found to be satisfactory. The
procurement of goods, works, construction and contracting services demonstrated economy and
efficiency. The price benchmarks adopted by the STU for manpower and building materials
were consistent with market reference prices.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

4.0.1 Sustainability: Factors likely to promote sustainability include:
  Extensive evidence that community O&M practices are satisfactory and appropriate for the
    SPs financed, and that the importance of O&M is well-understood;
  Evidence of social capital formation which can be leveraged for more complex and diverse
    investment activities, e.g., productive;
  MCs restructured, trained and operational in all 179 targeted municipalities, and
    instrumental in the deliberations of State Territorial Development Councils; and
  Mainstreaming of the project mechanisms and institutions.


                                                                                                  21
 4.0.2 Environmental management: SP environmental integrity is supported by the
following:
  Established environmental screening processes for all proposals, with access through co-
     participation arrangements and environmental expertise in specific cases;
  Standard subproject designs for all commonly demanded SPs, with design features for
     potential environmental issues, e.g., waste disposal for manioc mills;
  In-house environmental professionals in the STU;
  Environmental awareness built into training programs for CAs and MCs;
  Close attention to environmental compliance during Bank supervision missions including
     physical inspection of subprojects in the field; and
  Introduction of/training for a new category of environmental/ecological SPs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1   Moderately Satisfactory

Positive elements:
 Close Bank/Client collaboration during the preparation of both the OP and the AF;
 Calibration of project design with the lessons of previous similar projects in Pernambuco
   and other Northeast states and relevance to the Borrower’s rural priorities/strategy; and
 Incorporation of innovative elements designed to strengthen impact, improve targeting,
   promote integration and resource leveraging, and respond to Bank concerns about
   appropriate use of grant financing.

Negative elements:
 Inadequate design of PDO performance and intermediate impact indicators;
 Excessive number of impact indicators; and
 Lack of baseline data for the OP, not remedied during preparation of the AF even with
   evaluations and data available.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.2   The rating is based on the following:

    Positive elements:
   Supervision missions were timely, more frequent at critical periods, well-prepared and
    documented. The project absorbed 78 weeks of supervision; Bank supervision missions
    included randomized field visits to CAs, MCs and SPs;
   Aide Memoires were focused on key elements of project design and objectives, including
    fiduciary and safeguards performance. Time-bound actions expected of the Borrower were
    followed up and outcomes reported;
   Mid-term review (OP) was timely, comprehensive and all findings/recommendations were
    discussed with the STU, with documented follow-up;
   Team members worked with both outgoing and incoming administrations to facilitate
    smooth transitions with minimum disruption to the project; and
   Consistent focus on Financial Management and Procurement supervision/follow-up.



                                                                                         22
Negative elements:
 No MTR conducted during the AF;
 Bank supervision should have expanded to include a Water Specialist, given the large
   volume of small-scale water infrastructure financed under the project; and
 Inability to garner STU support for the follow-up to the FECAMP 2004 study to permit
   quantitative measure of project impact.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3 Overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on the Appendix A of
the ICR Guidelines (OPCS, August 2006, and updated June 05, 2007). Although the project
Team’s supervision performance was strong, it was not sufficient to balance out the over-
estimated indicators for beneficiary families and productive investments, nor to facilitate the
STU’s completion of the programmed suite of impact evaluation studies.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The Borrower's performance during preparation and implementation is rated
Satisfactory based on the following:

Positive Elements:
 Successive State Governments were committed to the project and its objectives as an
   integral element of their respective Multi-year Development Plans and rural strategies.
 Government underscored its commitment by leveraging another US$25 m. from diverse
   programs/agencies to further expand project coverage and intensify the focus on the most
   vulnerable groups.
 Despite government turnover, the fundamental thrust of the state's rural strategy and pro-
   poor orientation did not change.
 Government aggressively pursued preparation and negotiation of the AF and, in a similar
   vein, is actively developing a new and larger follow-on program with progressive objectives.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2 As noted in earlier sections, three separate state secretariats were responsible for the
project over its lifespan and this had both positive and negative institutional, operational and
strategic impacts on project implementation. The Moderately Satisfactory rating reflects
performance whereby the STU:

Positive Elements:
 Prevailed, given its technical and operational experience, over disruptive effects of
   government turnover and shifting rural strategy;
 Managed to ensure timely disbursement of both Loans, and achieved all project objectives
   and targets;
 Aggressively pursued and successfully utilized partnership arrangements to leverage
   technical, operational and financial support for the project;
 Explored and expanded approaches to productive investments under the Fair Trade initiative,
   Comércio Ético e Solidário, and arranjos produtivos, consistent with its longstanding track
   record of supporting innovation;
 Initiated a territorial development strategy and institutions with participation of MCs;



                                                                                             23
   Engaged with Quilombola (Afro-descendent) and ethnic communities through awareness-
    building, educational and cultural programs; and
   Maintained a cooperative and committed relationship with the Bank throughout.

Negative Elements:
 STU institutional reticence under the OP to productive SPs, while mitigated under the AF,
   led to markedly fewer such investments than anticipated; and
 Low priority placed on impact evaluation, as shown by the lack of follow-up to the
   FECAMP 2004 baseline study.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3   The overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1     CDD promotes social capital formation: The Project’s demand-driven feature
improves local governance by giving poor rural communities a unique set of experiences
involving: collective action; priority-setting; decision-making; and subproject financial
management, operation and maintenance. Social capital under this and similar projects is both a
benefit in its own right and an element in the success of community-driven rural poverty
reduction. Tangible benefits from subproject investments strengthen collective capacity,
generate a sense of citizenship, and raise the bar for local government accountability.

6.2     Decentralized project management improves responsiveness to beneficiaries: By
delegating responsibility for day-to-day implementation to regional technical offices, the
project’s markedly increased its visibility and accountability to beneficiary families. The
proximity of assistance activities - including technical and legal support – reduce subproject
processing times, strengthen the CAs’ management capacity and increase the quality and
frequency of STU supervision of overall implementation.

6.3     CDD can effectively target and empower poor rural women: Experience in
Pernambuco and elsewhere shows unequivocally that demand-driven mechanisms not only
enable women to access the benefits of community investments, but provide important
leadership/learning opportunities for women through the community associations and Municipal
Councils.

6.4      CDD is appropriate for ethnic groups and indigenous peoples: The project showed
that participatory, demand-driven mechanisms are consistent with the cultural practices of these
groups and that they can manage the subproject cycle, including its participatory mechanisms,
effectively.

6.5      Systematic impact evaluation requires more intensive focus: Ideally, evaluation
programs designed at Appraisal should be launched prior to Effectiveness as a priority of both
project execution and Bank supervision. A timely baseline study and follow-up/repeater survey
with control panels should be completed within the project’s lifetime. However, alternative,
simpler, but methodologically valid forms of evaluation should be explored if “heavier?
frameworks prove unworkable or unacceptably costly to the client. Parallel training can build
political and technical support toward a strong “evaluation culture?.

6.6    CDD mechanisms can improve the quality and targeting of non-project public
resources, while leveraging complementary funding and deepening the investment stock
needed for faster poverty reduction: The project leveraged an additional US$25.0 m. from
complementary sources to finance community investments. Increased efforts to channel other

                                                                                             24
Federal- and state-level programs through the Municipal Councils in Pernambuco can
potentially accelerate and intensify rural poverty reduction. Such integration merits greater Bank
support for its longer-term institutional and operational evolution, and for monitoring and
evaluating its implementation, outcomes and impact.

6.7      Preparation and analysis of small-scale productive ventures needs equal rigor.
Small scale grant-financed productive ventures, in contrast to community infrastructure, require
a business plan (including technical and financial analysis), up-front marketing arrangements
and formal training for the operational phase. Beneficiaries need to get it right the first time
under a one-time grant financing opportunity to jump-start employment and income generation,
in addition to using the experience to qualify for future financing from lending institutions. To
avoid "reinventing the wheel", successful productive subprojects should be studied carefully to
determine critical features, replicated where feasible and appropriate, and monitored over time
to assess evolution and lessons. A databank (case studies) of such experiences can leverage their
benefits longer-term and with wide geographic application.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies:

   The Borrower’s letter of July 9, 2010 (Annex 7) commenting on the draft ICR concurs in
    broad terms with the Bank’s assessment of the Project. This assessment takes into account,
    along with other documents, the findings of the Borrower Completion Report, which was
    prepared by the STU.

   The Borrower notes with satisfaction with partnership maintained with the Bank throughout
    project implementation, both in terms of financing (through the Bank loans 46250-BR and
    46251-BR) and technical assistance (via Bank supervision).

   The Borrower concurs with the overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory, further noting that
    the OP attained 58% of the target value for families benefited, while the AF achieved 88%
    on the same target.

   The Borrower shares the Bank’s observation that despite several public administration
    changes over the course of project implementation, project implementation did not suffer as
    a result. In fact, the Borrower notes that the State’s financing counterpart contribution was
    constant, as was its strategic focus on rural poverty reduction.

   The Borrower agreed with the scope and content of the Lessons Learned presented in the
    draft ICR, particularly noting the lessons regarding productive subprojects, such as: (i) the
    higher threshold for financial and economic analyses required; (ii) the importance of
    business plans to ground these subprojects in actual market opportunities; and (iii) strong
    focus on management training for the community associations in order to reduce risk of
    failure. These factors have been included in the State’s proposal for a new operation (with
    Bank financing) which would seek the economic inclusion and increased competitiveness of
    the small-scale agricultural producer.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1     The following shows physical outputs by component with separate discussions on
productive subprojects and targeting performance.

2.2      Component Community Subprojects: Community Subprojects are identified,
executed, operated and maintained by beneficiary communities, acting through their legally-
constituted CAs. The component (OP US$36 m., AF US$32 m., 90% and 80% of total
estimated project cost, respectively), was to finance matching grants to organized rural CAs for
about 1,560 and 1,100 small-scale investment SPs (under OP and AF, respectively) categorized
as infrastructure, productive and human development. New types of investments specified in the
AF included health, education, environment and culture. Subprojects under the OP were
expected to be financed under three subprograms - PAC (State Community Schemes), FUMAC
(Municipal Community Schemes) and FUMAC-P (Pilot Municipal Community Funds - of
varying degrees of decentralization and autonomy. PAC was expected to absorb about 5% of all
SP cost (up to US$ 1.8 m.); FUMAC about 80% (US$28.8 m.) and FUMAC-P about 15%
(US$5.4 m.). PAC was the least decentralized while FUMAC-P was the most advanced in
giving each MC its own budget envelop to manage.23 Although expected, there was not any SPs
financed by PAC, and it had already being phased out in Pernambuco (as in most Northeast
states) at the time of the AF. Under the AF, the FUMAC mechanism was mainstreamed, with
SP financing explicitly grouped in two areas according to municipal-level development (i.e.,
IDH-M).24

2.3      The combined project (OP/AF) financed 2,284 subprojects, benefiting some 96,400
families. Total cost of Component 1 under the OP was US$33.6 m. (97% of appraisal estimate)
and US$34.7m. under the AF (about 111% of appraisal estimate), including the State and
beneficiary counterpart contributions of US$13.8. Utilization of the Loan for Component 1
under the OP was US$23 m. (90% of the appraisal allocation) and US$24 m. under the AF
(110% of the appraisal allocation, see Annex 1). While the OP utilized FUMAC and FUMAC–P
mechanisms, 100% of SPs under the AF were channeled through the mainstreamed MCs. Total
cost of the component aggregating OP and AF was US$ 76.4 m.

2.4.     Demand: Project success depended on a wide mobilization of rural communities, their
organization into CAs and subsequent expression of their investment priorities in the context of
the MCs. Dissemination and mobilization were made using different means and methods and
reached all municipalities and communities, even the most distant from urban centers requiring
a substantial institutional effort to bring information and motivate the rural people to participate
in the Project. STU management was decentralized through the creation of RTUs. The
institutionalization of MCs allowed greater interaction with rural communities that stood to

23
  Under FUMAC, community associations participate in representative Municipal Councils with 80% majority membership of
beneficiaries and civil society, and 20% of municipal authorities and other entities. The Councils meet regularly to debate
community subproject proposals and set priorities, based on an indicative annual budget determined by the STU. Approved
subprojects are sent to the UNITEC for final technical and environmental analysis and approval. Funds are transferred directly to
the beneficiary association. In Pernambuco, many pre-existing Municipal Sustainable Development Councils (CMDS) were adapted
to project rules for representation (80/20 etc.) and became FUMAC Councils. FUMAC-P Councils were established as a pilot to
determine the utility and feasibility of allocating a number of more advanced Councils an annual budget to manage - based on an
Annual Operating Plan (POA). As with the other NE states, FUMAC-P did not function as expected and all were eventually
devolved to the original FUMAC design. The main reason was that the NE State Governments never felt comfortable with the
decentralization of actual funds management to these Councils. Further, some FUMAC-P tended to finance very small subprojects
designed to reach the maximum number of communities, resulting in low and localized impact. Finally, under PAC, community
associations submit subproject proposals directly to the State Technical Unit which transfers funds directly to the associations for
approved subproject. There is no representative Municipal Council. This mechanism was a holdover from an earlier period, and
utilized by communities in municipalities which had difficulty - for political/other reasons - in forming a Municipal Council. It is the
least decentralized and studies have shown, has the least impact on social capital formation.
24
  Area I represented 110 municipalities with HDI less than or equal to 0.632, with an estimated 70% of investments to finance
approximately 350 subprojects. In Area , 69 municipalities HDI higher than 0.632, with investments was expected to absorb 30%
of tall resources to finance approximately 150 subprojects.

                                                                                                                                    27
benefit from the project and the knowledge of the potential and the problems of each region.
This mobilization effort yielded an aggregate SP demand of 2,541 proposals, leading to the
approval and financing of 2,284 subprojects or 90% of total demand (Table 1 a-c).

2.5      Subprojects: The project financed 2,284 SPs, 86% of the combined target (see tables
2-a and 2-b). Average subproject cost was US$19,100 under the OP and US$63,600 for AF;
three factors help to explain this three-fold increase under the AF: (i) the appreciation of the
Real vis-à-vis the US Dollar over the project period; (ii) price inflation of materials and inputs;
and (iii) larger-scale SPs under the AF, as evidenced by the two-fold increase in average
families benefited per SP. Infrastructure and human development SPs had greater demand.
Under the OP 1,738 SPs were financed, 111% of target at appraisal. The AF financed 546 SPs,
only 50% of project target, yet these subprojects benefitted 33,800 families (89% of target).

Types of subprojects

2.6      Infrastructure: The strong demand for infrastructure, particularly the 1,172
subprojects in water supply financed under the project, confirms the precarious conditions in
which the rural population resides, where water shortages are chronic. Support for this type of
subprojects reflects the priority that the State placed on this issue. The average cost of
infrastructure subprojects was approximately US$18,500 (OP) and US$62,492 (AF). Each water
supply subproject benefited an average of 36 families (OP) and 63 families (AF).

2.7      Human Development: 755 SPs (e.g., household sanitation, housing rehabilitation)
benefited 24,700 families (some 108,860 people). The project financed 629 household
sanitation SPs, benefiting 20,500 families, with each SP benefiting approximately 33 families at
an average cost of U$67,00 (AF) and US$17,600 (OP).

2.8       Productive: The small amount of productive subprojects, particularly under the OP,
where demand was just 6% of appraisal estimate, did not decrease the overall result. The
analysis of SP demand and the overall project performance showed that, in the early years of
implementation, the poorest communities chose to prioritize infrastructure investments, such as
water supply and electricity (considered of extreme need) as well as investments that provided
improvement in the wellbeing of the population, such as household sanitation. This low rate can
also be credited to the management decision of ProRural with the application of stringent
criteria for the approval of such subprojects.

2.9      The volume of productive SPs increased significantly under the AF25, a direct result of
intensified action by new STU management to improve their preparation and monitoring. These
actions were under the responsibility of the “Center for Support to Productive Subprojects –
NAP26. The interdisciplinary NAP team ensured that productive SPs demonstrated economic

25
   Under the OP, only 21 productive SPs had the financial support from ProRural, while the AF financed 133 subprojects (six-fold
increase).
26
   The STU created NAP to enhance STU expertise vis-à-vis productive subprojects. NAP is comprised of seven technicians with
backgrounds in Agronomy, Engineering, Biology, Economics, Animal science and Psychology.




                                                                                                                            29
and technical feasibility, factors that definitively contributed to the success of these investments.
Most of the subprojects financed were in support of production, such as farm machinery, basic
grain processing and milk coolers. Although productive SPs increased significantly under the
AF, their integration to markets remained weak.

2.10    Tractors: The Project financed 100 agricultural mechanization SPs (e.g., tractors and
equipment). The vast majority of these SPs were rated highly by beneficiaries for their
economic and social benefits, including: (i) the ability to prepare land in time for the rainy
season; (ii) job creation capacity; and (iii) capacity to generate substantial community savings
from rental fees charged for tractor operation and maintenance. Examples of these benefits are
noted in project studies: (i) “Case Studies: Impact Evaluation of the PCPR II Subprojects
(Simões 2010); and (ii) Situational Diagnosis of 300 Productive Subprojects of the Rural
Poverty Reduction Project - UNITEC – ProRural (Polytechnic Association of Consulting
2009). The main social and economic effects arising from these SPs are as follows:

    Social effects include reduced time and labor spent on the improvement of the land.
     Manual land preparation, using a hoe, previously required 65 days; tractors reduce this to
     just six hours, freeing up time for leisure or income-generating activities.

    Economic effects include the use of machinery in the processing of land to improve soil
     quality and, as a consequence, increased productivity. The expectation is that production
     will increase from 30% to 40%, with the added value throughout the production chain,
     impacting mainly on household incomes. According to field studies (Polytechnic
     Association of Consulting 2009), 98% of beneficiaries stated that such investments help to
     increase family income. Capacity to generate community savings from higher rental fees
     previously charged for tractor operations and maintenance is another economic impact.
     Such savings are frequently applied by communities to new investments.

Targeting:

2.11    The Project was accurately targeted. FECAMP (2004) demonstrates that beneficiaries
conformed to the intended profiles and that the project is reaching its target population.
FECAMP found that the living conditions and socioeconomic status of beneficiary families
evidenced extreme poverty and that part of this population suffers food/nutritional deficits. The
study also found that municipalities with the lowest HDI-M, between 0.467 and 0.598, received
a proportionally greater volume of project resources. In terms of subproject value approved per
capita, municipalities with greater IDH-M (0.700-0.862) received proportionally less resources,
while the cohort with lowest IDH-M received a higher proportion, in line with project targeting
for both the OP and AF. FECAMP also found that the Project directly reached 10% of the total
poor rural families in Pernambuco in the first years of the OP. Given that 70% of the rural
population of Pernambuco lives below the poverty line, the Project’s reach is significant in both
absolute and relative terms.

2.12   The strategy of prioritizing municipalities with HDI-M below 0.623, implemented by
the Government of Pernambuco since 2002, was adopted and strengthened under the AF,
aiming to increase the impact of the project near the rural poor population of the state of
Pernambuco. Loan resources were explicitly allocated in two areas27, taking into account the
value of the HDI-M as well as differences in size and intensity of poverty among the
municipalities of the respective areas.




27
  Area I: 110 municipalities with HDI-M less than or equal to 0.632, with 70% of the resources to finance 770 subprojects. Area II -
69 municipalities with HDI-M greater than 0.632 with 30% of the total resources to finance 330 subprojects,

                                                                                                                                30
 2.13    Of the 546 28 subprojects financed under AF, 394 subprojects (US$24.6 m) were
 financed for Area I CAs, representing 71% of the total AF SP resources, slightly above target.
 As for Area II, it absorbed 29% of SP resources, to finance 152 subprojects (US$10.1 m.). The
 amounts and the percentages above are as targeted for each area and demonstrate the
 commitment of the State with the objectives of the Project in order to benefit the poor rural
 population of the state located in the municipalities with lowest HDI-M (Table 3).

 Integration:
 2.14     The Project leveraged R$47 m. (US$25 m.) to integrate the project with other agencies
 and programs (Table 5). The STU fostered partnerships to support the project, drawing State
 and Federal resources to communities and utilizing the MCs for participatory decision-making.
 Partners include MDS (Federal sanitation construction), MDA (Territorios da Cidadania,
 acquisition of vehicles and equipment for communities) and CONAB (direct purchase of
 products from family agriculture). FUNDARPE and CEPIR (training for indigenous/ethnic
 groups) are also partners, along with State water agencies. The MCs also showed strong
 capacity to establish partnerships and integrate with other programs and policies. (Table 4).

    Although the 546 subprojects under the AF were 49% of the appraisal target, these investments benefitted 32,370 families, 88%
 of the appraisal target. The number of subprojects may have been overestimated at appraisal and, considering various economic
 factors during the implementations of AF, both subproject scale and average cost were above the appraisal estimate.

    The criterion for the allocation of priority areas was adopted under the AF (2007-2010).

2.16     Component 2: Institutional Development (OP US$5.3 m.; AF US$2.7 m., 7% and
14% of total project estimated cost, respectively) financed technical assistance and training to
build capacity in implementing entities, including the CAs, MCs and the STU. Modest funding
was also included under the OP to support state institutional modernization related to poverty
reduction programs and policies following a similar, successful activity under the previous
project as part of the wider Bank/State dialogue.

2.17    This component financed training for CAs, MCs and STU project technicians, in addition
to technical assistance and information dissemination. Technical assistance and specialized
consultancies were financed for CAs and MCs to build and consolidate their participatory
decision-making processes and their role in overseeing subprojects execution. Special emphasis
was given to the sustainability of community investments, including specific themes, related to
the most demanded SPs (e.g., water supply, household sanitation).

2.18   This component financed some 2,146 training events for CAs, partner agencies, the MCs
and STU. These events had a massive participation of about 44,037 people. (See Table 7).

other support for the Project, integrate the Project locally to promote complementary activities
and diversify Project content conceptually and methodologically (Table 8).

2.22    Component 3: Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (OP
US$2.22 m.; AF US$2.25 m., 185% and 130% of total estimated project cost, respectively)
financed the costs (excluding salaries) of project administration and coordination including
supervision, monitoring and impact evaluation.

2.23    This component performed as expected, supporting project coordination and activities to
monitor project performance and results. Incremental operational costs (excluding salaries) of the
STU further improved supervision and strengthened project operation. The component financed
the upgrading of the project MIS, as well as public information outreach to disseminate
understanding about Projects objectives, benefits, rules and methodology.

2.24     The component also financed Regional Meetings of the MCs, one of the main
instruments for disseminating the Project to ensure transparency in the use of public resources.
Initially focused on the dissemination of the project, the Regional Meetings became an important
mechanism for strengthening the MCs and CAs. These meetings also provided structured
discussion for the MCs, enabling them to critique aspects of the project and develop the capacity
for discussion and understanding about the reality of the municipalities. Some 23 meetings were
held, of which one was statewide and 22 were Regional Meetings (Table 11). The State Meeting
promoted the “Contest of Councils’ Best Practices? in three different categories: (i) Management
and Internal Organization, (ii) Articulation and Social Policy, and, (iii) Implementation of
Development Policies.33
33
  57 entries of the Councils’ successful experiences were submitted via the internet, of which 9 were selected to be presented during
the State Meeting.

3.1 Project implementation, as forcefully stated by the Project´s Technical Unit, “aimed and
reached success in: (a) contributing to raise HDI for the poorest municipalities in the State of
Pernambuco through provisions of access to basic services of infrastructure, human
development, strengthening of local production chains, education, health, environment,
technology and technical assistance; (b) contributing to consolidate decentralized and
democratic public administration, able to promote the coordination and integration of actions
among the three levels of government, civil social organizations and from the private sector in the
municipalities and Development Regions (RDs), through interinstitutional coordination; (c)
supporting the communities to improve their management capability, wealth generation and
market insertion of their products and services; and (d)stimulating effective society participation,
through its organizations, including ethnical groups, youth, women, elderly and handicapped
people to occupy roles in decision processes at community, municipal and regional levels,
influencing the formulation and implementation of development policies.? (see ProRural -
Borrower Completion Report – AF).

3.2 The Project financed 2,284 community subprojects, benefiting some 96,398 families,
distributed in 179 municipalities and organized in some 2,216 community associations. Of
the 2,284 community subprojects financed and implemented, 93% comprised the following:
water supply, including cisterns; household sanitation; housing improvement and construction; farm
tractor; small irrigation schemes; honey production and processing; milk processing; rural
electrification and handicrafts. These main types of subprojects accounted for 87% of families
benefited under the Project. (see Table 3.1).

3.3 The Project was subject to a number of physical performance studies and implementation
reviews; the main findings of these studies are summarized in Annex 5. An end-of-project
impact evaluation study was not conducted; however, 29 case studies of typical subprojects -
with field data collection, were compiled to estimate indicative economic and financial results
of the Project. Additionally, a comparative analysis is done of the known results of similar
Projects and types of subprojects (water supply, sanitation, farm tractor and honey
production) in the Northeast Region (see Table 3.3).

Methodology: Case Studies

3.4 A case study approach was adopted, based on the four main types of subprojects (i.e.,
water supply; home sanitation; farm tractor; honey production and processing) and the
community associations demanding, executing and operating these investments. A sample of
29 subprojects (14 of water supply; 8 of home sanitation; 3 of honey production and 4 of farm
tractor) was selected. Statistical extrapolations for the entire universe of subprojects financed
were not intended, but there was a certain comfort level in exploring the results obtained for
four basic reasons: (i) the apparent homogeneity (i.e., representativeness) of the units comprising
the universe by type of subproject; (ii) the intentional decision to include subprojects
considered by knowledgeable people to be moderately successful, that is, the sampled units
were not limited exclusively to very successful subprojects; (iii) the STU took care to
select subprojects considered “typical?; and (iv) the communities composing the sample were
geographically-dispersed.

3.5 An STU technical team conducted the field research, interviewing beneficiaries and CA
leaders, those knowledgeable about the subprojects and their histories. Questionnaires were
applied, tailored to the nature of each subproject type studied, with questions permitting both
open and closed responses.

3.6 Net present values (NPV), benefit/costs ratios (B/C) and Internal Rates of Return (IRR) for
each subproject type sampled were estimated. Cost and benefits streams were built on the basis
of actual field data collected. IRRs were estimated using a 10-year period and the NPV was
calculated using a 10% discount rate. Two IRRs were estimated: (i) IRR-1, using actual
average values of the variables defined (see below) to measure costs and benefits; and (ii)
IRR-2, reflecting a sensitivity analysis by assuming 20% higher costs and a simultaneous 20%
reduction in revenues/benefits. All monetary values are expressed in Brazilian Reais.

3.7 Costs and benefits identified for each subproject type were the following:

       Honey production and processing: Total initial investment; annual operating costs;
        revenues derived from services provided by the processing unit controlled by the
        community association; value of incremental production and improved quality of honey;
        value of incremental employment generated by honey production and processing and
        revenues from community association membership fees.
       Farm tractor: Total initial investment; annual operating costs; revenues derived from
        services provided by the tractor and associated implements and value of incremental
        production of corn and beans.
       Water supply with household connection and cisterns: Total initial investment; annual
        operating costs; revenue for water consumption and membership fee (proxy for
        willingness to pay for unmeasured benefits); value of time of family members freed from
        having to catch water; value of incremental employment generated by water availability;
        value of reduced diseases and incremental investments.
       Home sanitation: Total initial investment; value of reduced diseases and incremental
        value of the houses due to the investments received.

3.8 The results of the exercise are shown in Table 3.2. Given the strong limitations of the
sampling procedures, though compensated in part by the manner in which the units were



                                                                                                  39
selected and interviewed, (see 3.4 above), the results serve mainly as indicators of the magnitude
of possible real value.

3.9 The major finding is that evidence suggests that financial returns are robust for water supply,
honey production and processing and farm tractor and even under very conservative assumptions
(shown by the sensitivity analysis – IRR-2). Regarding water supply (as shown in other studies such
as Binswanger 2005) and home sanitation, their positive impact on beneficiaries’ wellbeing is
widely recognized, despite the inability to fully quantify this impact in this exercise. The approach
here seems to yield very high financial returns for water supply investments and much lower,
although positive, for home sanitation investments. These investments are mainly justified by their
wellbeing impact.

Comparative analysis of results of Pernambuco and other States for similar projects

3.10 A comparison of financial returns to investments in the four types of subprojects, common and
similar in 7 individual States with RPRPs (see Table 3.3 suggests that Pernambuco is faring quite
well in water supply, farm tractor and honey production and processing subprojects. When compared
with results obtained by van Zyl et al. for all ten Northeast states, Pernambuco currently is faring
higher for two comparable types of subprojects: farm tractor and honey production.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1      FECAMP (2004): This baseline/evaluation covered three Northeast States - Ceará,
Pernambuco and Bahia. In Pernambuco, the study includes a survey of direct information in 50
cities and 61 SPs that benefited 8,602 families. The control group comprised 493 families. The
evaluation confirmed that 70% of the rural population was below the poverty line, with a profile
showing extreme poverty and deprivation. Access to basic services was low, adult illiteracy was
high. The study showed that the rural population of Pernambuco (under the OP) earned an average
income that some 5% below the poverty line. This study had a galvanizing effect on the project
by showing that the poorest segments of the rural population, those with lowest IDH-M, were
being reached. Case studies included in this evaluation showed that 86% of beneficiaries had
significantly improved living conditions from 2000 (pre-project) to 2002/2003. Income results
were promising and a range of variables was very positive for social capital gains.

5.2      CEPLAN (2004). This Physical Performance Study, developed by CEPLAN, was based
on quantitative and qualitative data for SPs implemented under the OP. The survey was
conducted in 50 municipalities across the 12 administrative regions of Pernambuco. It covered 92
communities and 619 families; 2,863 beneficiaries were interviewed. For 30% of these families,
the annual income was less than half the official minimum salary. For 21% of families, total
household income was approximately one salary. Most of the CAs interviewed (91%) reported
improvement in the quality of life of the population, while 83% confirmed a positive vision for
the use and benefits of the SPs. 87% noted that both benefits and subproject size conformed to
their expectations. Beneficiary families and the CAs had a positive outlook on project
performance. Better knowledge on the part of beneficiaries about the project and its operation had
a positive influence on the choice of their priorities. The option for decentralized management of
the project was perceived as a very positive point for achieving its goals and objectives.

5.3      POLICONSULT (2009). The report diagnosed the productive SPs implemented under
the OP and the AF. Data were collected for 300 subprojects in 114 municipalities. The research
sought to determine the current status these SPs. The report concluded that these SPs had
significant impact on quality of life of the beneficiaries, although this did not always translate into
increased income. There were direct and positive effects with the generation of employment
opportunities, improved infrastructure and the incorporation of social roles by the beneficiaries.

5.4     Physical Performance Study – Pereira and Gonçalves (2010). The study conducted an
ex-post evaluation of SP physical implementation, which was found to be satisfactory. The
procurement of goods, works, construction and contracting services demonstrated economy and
efficiency. The price benchmarks adopted by the STU for manpower and building materials were
consistent with market prices.

on Draft ICR

A. Borrower Completion Report (Executive Summary)

1. THE ORIGINAL PROJECT

7.1       The Rural Poverty Reduction Project (RPRP – Pernambuco, ProRural), operated by the
Technical Unit ProRural – UNITEC, subordinated, since 2004, to Secretariat of Social
Development and Citizenship (SDSC), was part of the strategy to support local development
adopted by State Government, as expressed in the State’s Multi-year Plan (PPA) 2004-2007. The
PPA sought to reduce social exclusion, through investments and actions of infrastructure and the
support for productive activities. As such, the RPRP introduced innovations by adopting the
following practices: (i) strengthening of the Community Associations, Municipal Councils and
Forums; (ii) decentralization of management through the establishment of eight Regional
Technical Units - RTUs; (iii) adoption of Regional Meetings to discuss with the Municipal
Councils criteria for prioritization of subprojects; (iv) establishment of strategic partnerships for
complementary actions; and (v) adopting a territorial approach as a strategy to support integrated
and sustainable local development, in contiguous municipalities with the lowest HDI of the state
(i.e., IPLD).

7.2     The operating model adopted by RPRP to support the rural population assumed that
mechanisms that include increased participation of civil society tend to generate better results as
enhanced social capital and increase the capacity of communities to mobilize internal and
external resources enables their development. In this sense, the financing of community
subprojects is presented as a catalytic instrument for mobilization and organization of these
communities.

1.1     Physical and Financial Performance of Subprojects

7.3     In the period from 2002 to 2006, 1,738 subprojects were implemented. In this period, the
RPRP benefitted 63,128 families across 1,644 associations in 175 municipalities within the 12
RDs of the State of Pernambuco. According to MIS data, 32% of the all community associations
benefited in that period were coordinated by women.

7.4     Human development and infrastructure were the most demanded and implemented types
of subprojects. Such dominance can be attributed, in part, to their standard designs, (e.g., housing
construction, household sanitation and cisterns). However, productive subprojects, due to their
complexity, were only 6% of the appraisal target. This low performance can be attributed to a
managerial decision of ProRural to finance only those productive subprojects that demonstrated
technical and financial feasibility, since numerous failures caused by the non-compliance of these
factors had occurred in earlier productive subprojects. With respect to the twelve Development
Regions, approximately 728 subprojects (42%) were implemented in the Agreste Region and 719
(41%) in the Sertão Region. The Zona da Mata garnered just over 14% of all subprojects (249),
while those municipalities comprising RMR captured 44 subprojects (3%).




                                                                                                  45
1.2. Advances and Innovations
Management
7.5     In pursuit of a management model that would guarantee efficiency with agility and
responsiveness to the community demands, the structure of UNITEC -- with its managers and
regional units – reflects the incorporation of a modern management pattern, as seen in the matrix
organizational structure.
7.6     The Project invested in the decentralization of management, through the strategic
deployment of eight regional technical units, located in Recife, Palmares, Limoeiro, Caruaru,
Garanhuns, Arcoverde, Salgueiro and Petrolina, with multidisciplinary teams in order to support
the 12 RDs and 179 municipalities in the project area. Thus, the most distant municipalities from
the state capital, Recife, started to have a closer project support. The management
decentralization has enabled greater flexibility in the performance of the RPRP, since the RTUs
started to act at various stages on the subprojects’ implementation. All procedures for the
approval decision and monitoring of subprojects implementation were devolved to the RTUs

Territorial Approach: The Experience of the Integrated Plan for Local Development (IPLD)
7.7      Studies conducted and the experience accumulated by the project technical staff signaled
the need to rethink the implementation model of the RPRP, mainly with the aim of proposing
actions that could bring more effective results for the poor rural population. At the same time, the
State Government, after evaluation of the PPA 2000/2003, acknowledged that while public
investment had increased in basic infrastructure, social programs and productive projects, many
municipalities remained in extreme poverty. This led to a decision in 2003 to formulate the
Integrated Plan for Local Development for the 11 contiguous municipalities located in the RDs of
Sertão of Moxotó and Agreste Meridional, which had the lowest HDI-M statewide. The IPLD
was proposed as a pilot project, representing a new perspective as a development strategy, which
provided evidence that guided the drafting of the proposed 2nd phase of the RPRP, and helped
along the process with the reorientation of RPRP actions under the 1st phase.

7.8     These 11 municipalities implemented community subprojects worth approximately R$
102 million, of which almost 8% represents RPRP resources. In this sense, compared with the
volume of resources invested by other Government Secretariats, it is clear that investments made
by RPRP from 2004 to 2006 were a catalyst for public policy actions undertaken by the State
Government in these IPLD municipalities. These subprojects afforded the rural population
greater accessibility to social services, water infrastructure, creation of new economic pole and
access to new technologies and other services.

7.9     The experience of IPLD represented an advance that should be incorporated into
programs that work with rural poverty. A major step was taken in order to seek the integration of
public policy actions. It is necessary to continue this experiment to try to break away from this
fragmented culture in the public sector. In addition, other intangible results of this experience
were the expanded participation of the population and a consequent incorporation of the most
excluded in the decision spaces.

Social Capital

7.10    The Supervision of Local Articulation (SALOC), linked to the Operations Management
was established in 2002, with the aim to strengthen the Municipal Councils, and to monitor and
enhance their actions. SALOC implemented a systematic work based on specific monitor tools,
among which stands out the annual assessment of the Municipal Councils, from which was
possible to identify the need for restructuring of 32 councils in 2004.

7.11     The empowerment of the Municipal Councils was achieved through systematic training,
supported by the RTU’s staff and monitored by SALOC. As a result of the Councils’ training
process, there was significant participation of rural farmers in deciding on the application of
resources within the municipalities and regions, promoting transparency and reducing political
interference in the management of the Project, realizing also, the integration of actions to reach
the most vulnerable populations. An important result of this process was that 100% of subprojects
financed were discussed in the municipal councils and boards, from the prioritization made by the
communities.

Regional Meetings of Municipal Councils

7.12     One of the main instruments for disseminating project information to ensure transparency
in the use of public resources were the Regional Meetings, which began in 2002 and have been
carried out annually in the Development Regions of the State. Later, these Regional Meetings
proved to be an important mechanism for strengthening the Municipal Councils and Community
Associations. The meetings also came to be a structured forum for discussion, enabling the
exercise of criticism and the development of capacity for discussion and understanding about the
reality of the municipalities.

Training of Community Associations

7.13     In parallel with actions for the strengthening of the Municipal Councils, investment in
training for the population benefited by RPRP can be considered as a contribution to the creation
of social capital in rural areas covered by the Project. The Community Associations have been
prepared on the operational aspects of subprojects, through capacity-building in bookkeeping, as
well as legal, technical and social issues, thereby addressing all areas necessary for subproject
implementation.

7.14    Considering the communities’ demand in the semi-arid region for cistern subprojects, one
focus of training in the period 2003 to 2006, was Management of Water Resources directed to
maintenance and use of cisterns. The training was conducted in partnership with the Semi-Arid
Articulation (ASA), and the municipal authorities, through the Health and Education Secretariats.
Since 2004, Environmental Health Education training has taken place for beneficiaries with
household sanitations subprojects. In addition to the training conducted under the project, the
Ministry of Social Development (MDS) sponsored, in 2005, training in Water Resources
Management for approximately 3,000 farmers in 69 associations in 29 municipalities which had

                                                                                               47
benefited from the construction of cisterns with MDS funds, including the training of 233
bricklayers.

Quilombolas

7.15    The Project benefited 516 Quilombola families in the Development Regions of Sertão,
Agreste Setentrional and Meridional, with an emphasis on water infrastructure subprojects (e.g.,
wells and cisterns).

Small agro-industries in Mata Sul

7.16    An example of successful partnerships under the RPRP was the Project for Small Agro-
industries in Mata Sul. The project, primarily discussed in the Microregional Articulation
Commission of Mata Sul, consisted of a development alternative for family farming in Mata Sul
Region.The process of implementing this project included institutional partners such as the
Northeast Development Superintendency (SUDENE)/ United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), SEBRAE, Support Programme for Sustainable Development of the Zona da Mata de
Pernambuco (PROMATA) and municipal governments, with the direct participation of farmers.
Among the areas targeted were fruits, brown sugar, dairy, herbal products and cotton processing.

1.3 Studies Impact Assessment - Indicator of Sustainability

7.17    The FECAMP indicates that, even living in poverty, a significant portion of project
beneficiaries improved their living conditions, and that the Project had direct impacts on health,
hygiene, housing and welfare, but no impact on income, food security and job stability. The
FECAMP study highlights these specific impacts:

Water Supply Systems, Cisterns and Small Dams: (i) regular and reliable water supply; (ii)
reduced time spent in activities to obtain water from distant sources, thereby releasing time for
work or leisure; (iii) reduced health problems related to consumption of contaminated water; (vi)
higher property values; and (v) greater community participation in both construction and
maintenance activities.

Household sanitation and Housing: (i) improved family hygiene and reduced incidence of
diseases; (ii)generated consumer demand for hygiene products (e.g., soap, soap, toilet paper); (iii)
generated pressure for income from new needs; (iv) significantly improved the daily physical
comfort of the family; and (v) increased participation in community associations’ activities.

7.18     According to data from PNAD 2001 and 2004, some changes can be found in the rural
reality of the State, with an improvement in the provision of electricity, piped water and
household sanitation:
Electricity:
      2001 – 391,090 households
      2004 – 440,567 households
Household Sanitation
    2001 – 242.977 households
    2004 – 256,402 households
Piped Water
    2001 – 113,645 households
    2004 – 124,999 households


                                                                                                 48
2. ADDITIONAL FINANCING

2.1. Introduction

7.19     The second phase of RPRP (2007-2010) continued the strategies adopted under phase I of
the project while introducing the following new practices: (i) adoption of Regional Meetings to
discuss with the Municipal Councils for Rural Development - CMDR and planning priorities of
the municipality, the criteria for prioritization of subprojects and inter-institutional articulation
processes; (ii) establishment of strategic partnerships for complementary actions; (iv)
mainstreaming the territorial approach piloted under phase I; (iv) establishment of an
interdisciplinary working group focused on improving the execution of productive subprojects,
the Center for Support to Productive Projects - NAP; and (v) implementation of an enhanced
training strategy and the articulation of networks of producers and project beneficiaries.

2.2 Community Subprojects

7.20    In the period 2007-2010, 546 subprojects were implemented, with investments of
US$ 34,706,556.47, 75% of which was financed by the World Bank loan, 15% was from the
State of Pernambuco and 10% from the rural community associations. During this period, the
project benefited 33,185 families and 546 associations in 175 municipalities within 12
Development Regions.

7.21   As in the first phase, most of the subprojects financed were for infrastructure, with a total
of 52%. The actions of human development and productive, with 24% of total subprojects for
each, were increased mainly in the last two years of the Project execution.

Source: Unitec/ ProRural – April 2010.
7.22    There was significant progress in the volume of investment in productive subprojects
under the AF, a direct result of the intensified action of UNITEC and NAP to improve the
preparation and monitoring of such subprojects.

Distribution in State Development Regions

7.23    The decentralized management of PRORUAL, with the consolidation and distribution of
the RTUs, gave ample project coverage for the 12 Development Regions. By Development
Region, approximately 43% of all subprojects financed were implemented in Agreste RDs (237
subprojects), while 33% were implemented in the Sertão’s RDs (179 subprojects). The Zona da
Mata was benefited with 114 subprojects, which represents 21% of the total, while in RMR were
implemented 16 subprojects, 3% of the total. An emphasis was given to Agreste Meridional RD
where were implemented a total of 113 subprojects, which represents 21% of total subprojects
financed under the AF. The distribution of subprojects (both in volume and R$ invested) was

                                                                                                     49
inversely correlated with the HDI for the each RD: the lower the HDI, the higher the level of
subproject investments.

Strengthening of Municipal Councils and Promotion Meetings

7.24     The Strengthening of Municipal Councils promoted the debate on their overall
composition and their social control role for public policies. Some 178 Municipal Councils were
restructured under the AF and consolidated as Municipal Councils for Rural Development
(CMDRs). In 94 of these restructured Councils, Arrays of Priorities were developed and actions
defined to achieve them.

2.3 Institutional Development

7.25   The promotion of Regional Meetings was continued in this second phase of the project.
There were 22 Regional Meetings (3.245 participants). Besides these meetings was held the First
State Meeting with 602 participants.

7.26    The first State Meeting represented a milestone in respect of the Councils’ life as it
helped to establish the identity of those entities with the achievement of public policies. At the
State Meeting was promoted the Contest of Councils Best Practices in three different categories:
(i) Management and Organization Affairs; (ii) Social and Politics Articulation; (iii), and the
implementation of policies Sustainable Rural Development.

7.27     In respect to institutional development, various training activities were promoted under
phase II, targeting the Municipal Councils, including the Regional Meetings and State Meeting,
and those directed toward the Community Associations and improvement of the UNITEC
technical team. Some 863 trainings were conducted with the participation of 16,204 people. Of
this total 564 were held for the Municipal Councils which were attended by 7,887 people. The
community associations were benefited from 276 trainings with the participation of 8,152 persons,
and for UNITEC were conducted 23 courses for 165 technicians.

2.4 Advances and Innovations
Attention to special groups

7.28    ProRural paid significant attention to special groups, among them: (i) Quilombolas; (ii)
indigenous peoples; (iii) women; and (iv) youth. One result of this approach was the preparation
of Plans of Action of 11 Indigenous people, through an agreement with the Association of
Indigenous Peoples of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and Northeast – Apoinme.

7.29    The Project, in order to intensify its work with special groups, promoted the articulation
and integration between State Secretariats, especially the Secretariat of Women and Youth. The
Project also contributed to the construction of the first State Plan for Public Policies for Rural
Women of Pernambuco. In articulation with the Secretariat for Youth, the project sponsored
workshops and seminars for the discussion of public policies for rural youth. The Project also
obtained a seat on the “Comitê de Promoção de Políticas de Igualdade Étnico Racial CEPPIR?
enabling the mobilization of resources from FUNASA for Quilombola communities.

7.30     Under the RPRP as a whole, a total of 38 entities linked to special groups were benefited
with the financing of R$4 million, allowing their access to water, cisterns and ways to strengthen
their production process, such as tractors and milk coolers.

                                                                                               50
7.31    In support of Quilombola communities and as a complementary mechanism to the
available resources through the RPRP, the Project mobilized resources from the Japanese Fund
for Social Development - JSDF. The Project for Promotion of Leadership of Quilombola
Communities in Pernambuco – PPCQ, is now beginning its implementation. This project, besides
supporting the preparation of development plans in these communities, has the goal of digital
inclusion of the Quilombolas through the acquisition of computers and equipment for Internet
connections and implementation of information centers.

Innovation

7.32    The Innovative Weaving Networks Project, in partnership with AVSI, aimed to generate
an environment of cooperation among production units for the construction and dissemination of
