OIL INDIA LIMITED (OIL) PETROLEUM PROJECT
LOAN NO. 2785-IN
INDIA
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    In mid-1986, India's oil demand and supply forecast showed rapidly increasing demand in
the 1990s but production stagnated in the early part of the decade, followed by a steady declining
trend. Without a major program to expand domestic oil and gas production, it was apparent that
the country would have to rely more on oil imports to meet the energy needs and that this increased
reliance would be costly to the economy. As part of a strategy to expand oil and gas production,
the Government of India (GOI) requested Bank support in financing the investment programs of
the country's two public oil companies: the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India (ONGC) and
oil India Limited (OIL). The Western Gas Development Project (WGDP), was to help finance
investments of ONGC, which accounted for about 90 percent of the country's oil and gas
production. The WGDP also addressed development and pricing issues for gas, which was an
under-developed and environmentally attractive fuel. In contrast, the Oil India Limited Petroleum
Project (OILPP) focused primarily on the technical aspects of maximizing oil recovery from
declining oil fields in Assam, which accounted for 10 percent of the country' s oil and gas
production. OIL expected to deplete its reserve base of 46 million tons (mit) over a period of 17
years and was also losing potential gas resources through flaring because of limited regional gas
markets and the lack of facilities for conserving the gas. Furthermore, the OILPP was to help OIL
expand its operations outside of the Assam area, as part of a strategy to promote greater
competition in the oil and gas sector.
Proiect Objectives and Components
ii.    The objectives of OILPP were to: (a) reduce the decline in oil and gas production in the
Assam area; (b) minimize the flaring of gas not consumed by installing facilities for gas compression
and re-injection into the field; (c) evaluate discoveries in OIL's newly-licensed areas of Arunachal
Pradesh and Rajasthan, especially structures that were deep and geologically complex; and (d)
improve the technical ability of OIL in various aspects of reserve evaluation and field development.
These objectives were a reasonable response to maxmnizing oil and gas recovery. The project had
four components for meeting its objectives (paras. 4-9). The first was a program of development
drilling, field rehabilitation and pilot testing of enhanced oil recovery techniques. This program was
to bring about cumulative incremental production of 20 mmt over the period 1987/88 to 2005/06.
The second was the installation of facilities for gas compression and re-injection, to reduce gas
flaring. The third consisted of field operations for evaluating the reserve base of previous
discoveries, introducing new technologies for better delineation of field structures and
maximization of oil recovery. The fourth focused on improving OIL's technical and management
capabilities by working with advanced petroleum industry technology and managing specialized
contractual services for certain field operations.



...
Implementation Experience and Results
imi. As the Bank's appraisal had envisaged, the project took place over a period of about seven
years and five months, from April 1987 to September 1994. Several factors periodicaly slowed the
project's implementation but did not delay its closing date. These factors included: civil
disturbances in the Assam area and related shortages of field operations personnel; inadequate
planning and logistical arrangements in the early years of the Project; and procurement problems
(paras. 20-23). Total project costs were US$883 million compared to US$584 million estimated at
appraisal. The higher costs were due mainly to extensions of seismic surveys and drilling programs
to reach the project's production objectives. The Bank disbursed a total of US$138.5 million of the
original loan amount of US$140 milion and canceled the remaining US$1.5 million.
iv.   The production improvement component increased oil reserves by about 100 mmt and gas
reserves by around 24 bcm. The Bank and OIL expect that incremental production associated with
the Project, over the period 1987/88 to 2005/06, will amount to 30 mmt, compared to an appraisal
estimate of 20 mmnt. In addition, OIL has estimated that, during the same time period, incremental
gas production related to the project will amount to 9 mmtoe. The Project also has helped OIL
maximize gas recovery by re-injecting 1.5 mmcmn/d of associated gas into the fields. The project's
evaluation of new discoveries has led to increases of 7.7 mit in oil reserves and about 8.4 bcin in
gas reserves. OIL's technical capability has improved, particularly in the areas of seismic data
interpretation, deep-well evaluation, environmental screening and mitigation in old oil fields, and
the management of contractual field services. The project's promotion of contractual services for
specialized field operations has reduced the company's operational costs. OIL was financially
viable throughout the project and complied with all of the project's financial covenants.
Sustainability of Proiect Achievements
V.    OIL has the capability to fully sustain the achievements of the project in reserve evaluation,
production, and field operations management. To reach forecast oil production levels during
1994/95 to 2005/06, additional investments will be necessary for annual well rehabilitation
programs. Also OIL plans to complete the appraisal and development of the Rajasthan gas field,
including the construction of a 50-km pipeline to deliver about 1 mmcnx/d of gas to the Rajasthan
State Electricity Board. OIL will handle these investments on its own and at the present time there
are no plans for a follow-up Bank project.
Main Findinfs. Future Onerations and Lessons Learned
vi.   The overall outcome of the project was highly satisfactory - it substantially achieved all of
its objectives with better results than anticipated, and did so within the original time frame the
project's appraisal had envisaged (paras. 11-16). OIL has acquired the technical capability for
fiurther production improvement, reserve evaluation and field operations management. There is no
follow-up operation planned. The project's implementation experience and results indicate several
important lessons in improving technical operations and project management. These are as follows:



iv
(a)  Concentrating field operations on the core business of producing oil and gas,
rather than merely fulfilling other performance targets such as areas surveyed
and wells drilled, can substantially increase production and reduce the
possibility of unproductive wells.
(b)  Contracting specialized companies to perform operations in areas where OIL
does not have a comparative technical advantage can improve both the
quality of operations and cost effectiveness.
(c)  Using modem field technologies, such as three-dimensional seismic surveys
and horizontal and directional drilling, can greatly enhance field productivity.
(d)  Delegating operational authority to field staff is important for minimizing
operational and logistical difficulties that can delay project implementation.
(e)  Maintaining a procurement process which involves several administrative
layers of approval and sometimes takes actions that are not consistent with
Bank guidelines can disrupt project implementation and prevent a project
from attaining the best results possible.



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
EVALUATION OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Introduction
1.    The Oil India Limited (OIL) Petroleum Project (OILPP) was part of a strategy the
Government of India (GOI) had adopted for reducing the expected decline in oil production during
the 1990's and minimizing the flaring of associated gas. Even with anticipated improvements in
energy efficiency, petroleum demand and supply forecasts at the time of the project's appraisal
(February 1987), showed that by 2000 oil demand would reach 80 million tons (mmt) while
domestic oil production would stagnate in the early 1990s at 40 mmt and begin a steady decline by
the middle of the decade. Without a major program to expand domestic oil and gas production, it
was apparent that India would have to rely more on imported oil to meet its energy needs and that
this increased reliance would be costly in terms of foreign exchange.
2.    As part of a strategy to increase domestic oil and gas production, the Bank and GOI were
jointly preparing projects to support the investment programs of the country's two public sector oil
companies: the Oil and Natural Gas Commission of India (ONGC) and Oil India, Limited (OIL).
The Western Gas Development Project (WGDP) was to help finance the investment program of
ONGC, which accounted for 90 percent of the country's oil and gas production. This project also
was to address development and pricing issues for gas, which was an underdeveloped and
environmentally attractive fuel. In contrast, OILPP was to focus primarily on the technical aspects
of maximizing oil recovery from declining fields in Assam, which accounted for 10 percent of the
country's total oil and gas production. Furthermore, OILPP was to help OIL expand its operations
outside of the Assam area in an effort to promote greater competition in the oil and gas sector.
Proiect Objectives
3.    The Project's specific objectives were to: (a) reduce the decline in oil and gas production in
the Assam area; (b) minimize the flaring of gas not consumed by compressing it and re-injecting it
in the field; (c) evaluate discoveries in OIL's newly-licensed areas and deep oil indications in the
Arunachal Pradesh area, and (d) improve technical ability of OIL in oil production and
development. These objectives were a reasonable response to expected shortages in petroleum and
the waste of valuable gas resources through flaring.



2
Proiect Components
4.    Increased Production from the Assam Qil Fields. OIL's original estimated geological
reserve base in Assam was 417 mmt of oil and 140 bcm (560 million toe) of gas. Estimated oil
reserves recoverable through pimary techniques were 185 million tons, and at the time of appraisal
OIL had recovered about 139 mmt leaving remaining recoverable rcserves of 46 mRt. At a
production rate of 2.7 mmt per annum, OIL expected to deplete these reserves over a 17-year
period. Options for reversing the declining trend, and enhancing OIL's production prospects
included: (a) accelerating the development of underdeveloped oil fields that already were
producing; (b) applying secondary and tertiary recovery techniques to existing wells which were
declining; (c) appraising unevaluated discoveries in the Assam area; and (d) extending exploration
worked to areas outside of Assam where OIL held licenses.
5.    The project planned to bring about cumulative production of oil amounting to 20 mmt,
between 1987/88 and 2005/06, through: development drilling of about 90 wells; the rehabilitation
of 900 wells; and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilot operations, including field applications of
enriched gas miscible flood, polymer flood, and steam injection.
6     Gas Re-injection and Flowback Scheme. At the time of appraisal, gas reserves
recoverable through primary techniques amounted to 104 bcm. OIL already had recovered 34 bcm,
and the remaining recoverable reserves were 70 bcm. Total gas production available for sale was
about 4.8 mmcm/d with annual offlake of consumers in the area amounting to only 1.9 mmcm/d.
OIL was flaring the remaining 2.9 mmcm/d because it did not have the facilities for gas
compression and re-injection. To meet fuel needs and maximize resource recovery, the project
provided for the installation of gas-gathering systems with compressors for re-injection into the
field. It also was to connect the production and distribution grids to of OIL and ONGC to better
meet the demand in each system and minimize gas supply imbalances.
7.    Given the limited potential markets for the gas in the region, there was a need to analyze
possible uses for the gas as well as options for transporting it to other parts of India. Therefore,
during the implementation of the project, GOI agreed to discuss with the Bank the results of a
study it was preparing, at the time of appraisal, on gas development and utilization options in the
Assam region.
8.    Exploration. The exploration component focused mainly on evaluating previous
discoveries, mostly in Arunachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. This component consisted of three major
activities. First, it provided for contractor services to do the necessary seismic surveys, data
acquisition and processing. Second, it provided OIL with equipment and training to interpret the
seismic results and minimize the risk of drilling dry holes. Third, it covered well-drilling activities
and associated field services. Finally, OIL and the Bank determined that the use of contractor
services for drilling would be the least-cost option for evaluating discoveries in Arunachal Pradesh
and Rajasthan. Furthermore, O1L needed specialized drilling assistance for deep structures in these
areas.

9.   Institution-Building. Overall, OIL had staff capable of implementing the Project: a total
of 7,500 employees of which 800 were high-level technical staff with graduate degrees. The
technical staff were familiar with literature on advances in petroleum exploration technology but
had little experience in the application of such technology. In the exploration and development of
the Assam area, OIL had used technology which at the time of project appraisal was considered
obsolete. In particular, OIL's staff needed guidance to cope with the drilling conditions in new
environments outside the Assam area. Therefore, the project provided a component for enhancing
OIL's technical capabilities through expert assistance in exploration, seismic data acquisition, and
processing, drilling, training, geological laboratory analysis, and EOR technologies.
Analysis of Proiect Risks
10.   The Project's analysis of risks associated with its implementation was comprehensive and
the mitigation measures it provided were appropriate. The risk analysis covered the possibilities
that compared to plans in the SAR, the geology of the areas selected for evaluation would be less
favorable; lower oil production would result from improvement programs; EOR would not be
technically or economically viable and; low oil prices would make the OIL project uneconomic. To
minimize geological risks, the project provided for comprehensive evaluation procedures, priority
ranking of sites for evaluation, and periodic reassessment of the program's evaluation by OIL and
the Bank in order to maximize results. The extensive data base that OIL used in its projections,
including a twenty-five year production history of relevant fields, and a conservative approach to
determination of recoverable reserves substantially diminished the risk of low production.
Concerning the EOR program, the SAR acknowledged that the diversity of oil and gas reservoirs
made it difficult to predict eventual results with a high degree of confidence. In the past, OIL had
obtained inconclusive results so the EOR component focused only on pilot testing to determine the
economic and technical viability of various EOR techniques. Finally, the analysis of the
economic-rate-of-return (ERR) on the relevant project components determined that the project
would remain economically viable above an international price of US$6 per barrel and indicated
that the likelihood was very small that prices would fall below this level during the project's
implementation period.
PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
Overview
11. The project substantially achieved all of its objectives with much better results than
anticipated and within the original time frame envisaged at Project appraisal (Table 1). As the SAR
had envisaged, the project took place over a period of about seven years and five months, from
April, 1987 to September, 1994 (Table 3). Total project costs were US$883 million compared to
US$584 million estimated at appraisal (Table 8A). The higher costs were due to extensions of
seismic surveys and drilling programs to meet Project objectives. The Bank disbursed a total of
US$138.5 million of the original loan amount of US$140 million and canceled the remaining
US$1.5 million at the request of the Borrower. The following sections outline the main
achievements of the various project components.



4
ImDroved Oil and Gas Production from Existing Fields
12.   During the period from 1986/87 to 1988/89, the project's production improvement work
stopped the decline in oil production that had been taking place at the rate of 8-10 percent.
Between 1988 and 1994 the project helped increase production from about 2.5 mmt annually to 3.0
mmt. OIL's forecasts now indicate that total incremental production associated with the project
through 2005/06 will amount to 30 mmt of oil, compared to an appraisal estimate of 20 mmnt, plus
an additional 9 mmtoe of gas unforeseen at appraisal. Most of the incremental production is due to
the rehabilitation of old wells and the expansion of development drilling, without relying on the
secondary and tertiary recovery work that the SAR had anticipated.
Greater Gas Resource Recovery and Utilization
13.   OILPP has made it possible for OIL to avoid from flaring an average of 1.5 mmcm/d
through the installation of compressors for gas compression and re-injection into the field. The gas
utilization study which GOI conducted during the Project's implementation period indicated that:
(a) the re-injection program for gas associated with oil production was an economically viable
operation for reducing gas flaring; (b) non-associated gas reserves exceeded the needs of the Assam
area but were insufficient to make gas transport to markets outside the area economically viable;
and (c) the economic development of local gas use would require some marketing activities to
reach a demand level of at least five mmcmld. New gas discoveries in Rajasthan, associated with
the project, will be used for local power generation.
Substantial Increase in the Reserve Base
14. The project's production improvement component added about 100 mnmt to OIL's reserves
and around 24 bcm to its gas reserves in the Assam area. Seismic surveys, related geological
studies, and well drilling in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam have further increased oil reserves by 7.7
mmt and gas reserves by 3.4 bcm. The evaluation of deep oil structures in Arunachal Pradesh is still
in progress. In Rajasthan, similar field evaluation work has led to the discovery of four gas fields,
which are still in the process of evaluation, and some heavy oil deposits. The initial reserve
estimate for the gas fields is 5 bcm but ongoing appraisal findings have indicated that the ultimate
reserve base should be substantially higher. OIL hired the Alberta Research Council (Canada) to
study the heavy oil discovery and, on the basis of the study's findings, OIL is promoting the area
for development by international oil companies (Table 7).
Improved Technical Capability of OIL
15.   OILPP provided OIL with comprehensive technical assistance and training in all aspects of
management operations, including environmental screening and mitigation, especially for activities
associated with old oil fields.



5
Enhanced Private Sector Particioation in the OR and Gas Sector
16.   The project encouraged the use of private-sector specialists in drilling operations and other
field services, such as well rehabilitation and production testing. It also helped train OIL staff to
manage its operations participation of the private sector. The contracting of field services to
private entities led to a 25 percent reduction, on average, in the costs of these services, compared
to such service expenditures prior to the project.
Economic Performance
17.   The SAR for the OILPP estimated the project's economic rate-of-return (ERR) at 94.7
percent. The ICR re-estimate of the ERR is 96.5 percent. The re-estimate is higher despite
expanded capital costs because of greater increases in incremental oil production from the project
than the SAR originally expected and additional benefits from gas production, which the SAR did
not foresee. The gas flaring reduction component had an expected ERR of 48 percent. For the
ICR re-estimate of net benefits, the calculation of an ERR was not applicable because the value of
gas recovered from flaring far exceeded the costs of facilities, which were only a fraction of those
that the SAR had envisaged. As a result, the net benefit stream had no negative cash flow. Actual
costs for gas flaring reduction were much lower than anticipated because the reduced ratio of gas
produced along with oil led to a decrease in the size of the gas compression program.
Financial Viability of OIL
18.   OIL remained financially viable under the project. GOI fulfilled its obligation to review and
set prices at a level that would allow OIL to meet its operating expenses and earn a reasonable
financial rate-of-return. In addition, OIL complied with the covenant to take the necessary steps to
ensure annual consolidated internal cash generation of at least 1.5 times the consolidated debt.
Environmental Protection and Safety
19.   The SAR did a satisfactory review of the potential environmental impact of the project and
the project's design also included adequate steps to ensure worker safety. Seismic data acquisition
took place in sparsely populated areas. The project did not involve any clearance of forests. The
drilling standards of the oil industry in India were sufficient to protect all aquifers. OIL took the
required care in the cleanup of drilling sites avoided the use of toxic drilling chemicals, and
minimized the possibility of fire by using sophisticated equipment to monitor traces of gas that may
escape from wells and equipment to prevent blow-outs. Finally, OIL took the necessary
precautions, in line with industry practice, to protect its workers and the environment during the
implementation of the Project and OIL is expected to sustain these precautions in the future.

MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING PROJECT PERFORMANCE
Civil Disturbances in Assam
20.   The civil disturbances which took place in Assam during most of the project's
implementation were severely detrimental to project performance. At times the disturbances were
so disruptive that all oil production facilities had to shut down completely. The extended closing of
wells adversely affected their structural integrity and reduced the long-term deliverability of the
reservoirs. Furthermore, the disturbances made it difficult for OIL to hire and retain both foreign
and local contractors for field services. OIL even had problems retaining its own staff in the region.
Shortafe of Field Ogerations Personnel
21.   During the project's implementation, staff departures because of civil disturbances in
Assam, led to a shortage of staff experienced in field operations. A number of field personnel
believed they were not receiving sufficient compensation for working in an area prone to civil
unrest. Bank supervision missions discussed this problem with the Ministry of Petroleum, the
Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) and OIL on a number of occasions, and reached an
agreement that OIL would review the personnel shortage and seek GOI approval for measures to
attract and retain field personnel, especially for drilling and well rehabilitation work. GOI
considered the matter but ultimately was constrained from making changes in its field personnel
policy to address the problem.
Inadeauate Plannins and Logistical Arrangements
22.   OIL's inadequate planning and logistics, especially for operations outside the Assam area,
caused some difficulties in project implementation. For example, delays in the preparation of well
locations, on several occasions, slowed the progress of the drilling sequence, which was a critical
aspect of the project. However, during the course of the Project's implementation, training
programs helped improved planning, especially the prioritization of drilling prospects, and enhanced
logistical operations by enabling OIL to deploy equipment, facilities and personnel outside the
Assam area.
Procurement Problems
23.   Gors complex, bureaucratic, procurement process was at times a major impediment to
maimizing the benefits of the project. This process involved excessive, centralized GOI control
through a complex series of committees which had the authority to stop or delay the entire
procurement process. In particular, a problem arose with GOI's decision, in 1990, to ban certain
firms from participation in the tendering process because of GOIs objections to their practices in
activities outside the project. These firms had been involved in the supply of oil and gas equipment
for a number of years. This ban, which was inconsistent with the procurement rules of the Bank,
held up the tendering process. The Bank requested that GOI resolve the issue by submitting the



7
allegations for judicial determination and, pending the outcome, allow the firms to participate in
Bank-financed procurement of goods and services. GOI removed the ban in 1992.
CHANGES IN PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
24.   The total cost of the project was US$883 million, compared to the SAR's estimate of
US$584.1 million. The increased cost resulted mainly from extensions of production improvement
work in old fields and seismic activity for field evaluation work, in order to attain the Project's
objectives for increased oil and gas production as well as additions to the oil and gas reserve base.
SUSTAINABILITY OF PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
25.   OIL should be able to fully sustain the project's achievements. Additions to the oil/gas
reserve base, combined with the equipment, training and technical assistance under the project,
have greatly enhanced the company's capability, on its own, to bring about the expected production
associated with the project during the period 1995/96 to 2005/06. OIL will have to make some
additional investments in well rehabilitation to reach the target production level for oil and gas that
OIL expects to result from production improvement schemes. Furthermore, in Rajasthan, OIL has
plans for development drilling in the region's gas fields and a 50-kilometer (km) pipeline to deliver
about 1.0 mmcm/d of gas to the Rajasthan State Electricity Board's 35-MW power plant at
Ramgarh. Additionally, OIL now has incorporated the practice of contracting field service
operations to private experts and should continue to benefit from the related cost advantages.
BANK PERFORMANCE
26.   In project preparation and appraisal, Bank assistance was especially useful in helping OIL
prepare a comprehensive evaluation of the risks associated with the project. The Bank's monitoring
of the project's implementation was very effective, especially in helping OIL establish priorities for
its drilling program. Supervision reports on the project were substantive and recommended
clear-cut actions to remove some of the obstacles responsible for delays in project implementation.
Furthermore, OIL's evaluation of the project's performance (Appendix 1 of the ICR) indicates that
the Bank's overall support of the project and the needs of the Borrower was highly satisfactory.
BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.   GOI was the Borrower for OILPP and OIL was the Implementing Agency. GOI complied
with all covenants of the Loan Agreement (Table 10). The project's results were good, but they
could have been even better if there had not been serious civil disturbances in the Assam area and if
OIL had been able to offer adequate incentives to compensate its field operations staff in Assam for
difficulties experienced working in an area of civil unrest. GOI, however, was reluctant to make
any exceptions for the field operations staff. OIL's preparatory work for the project was thorough
and its operational performance was quite good. Initially OIL's planning and logistical
arrangements slowed the start-up of the project, but these operations eventually improved
considerably.

ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
28.   The overall outcome of the project was highly satisfactory (Table 1). The project met all of
its major objectives, exceeded several production targets set in the SAR and produced an
acceptable ERR. Furthermore, OIL now has the technical and managerial capability to sustain the
oil and gas production benefits of the project through at least 2005/06.
FUTURE OPERATIONS
29. There is no future operation planned at the present time.
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
Technical Operations
30.   Efficiency of Field Ogerations. OIL learned that it can increase production more
effectively by concentrating on the core business of producing oil and gas rather than merely
fulfilling planned targets for field operations, such as the number of wells drilled.
31.   Use of Technical SDecialists. The project helped convince OIL that contracting services
to specialized companies in areas where OIL does not have sufficient expertise can improve the
quality of work significantly and enhance cost effectiveness.
32.   Introduction of Modern Field Technoloeies. OIL found that the project's use of
three-dimensional seismic surveys had considerable advantages over the two-dimensional
technology the company had been using. The additional dimension in the seismic work and the use
of directional and horizontal drilling technology proved to be very effective in reducing the risk of
drilling unproductive wells.
Proiect ImDlementation Manafement
33.   Use of Field Manaaement Teams. Delegating operational authority to field staff was
important for minimizing logistical difficulties in remote areas, such as Arunachal Pradesh and
Rajasthan, situated several thousand miles from company management which is located in New
Delhi. This arrangement enabled local management teams to make immediate decisions in the field
and made a substantial contribution to completing the Project on time.
34.   Procurement. A procurement process involving several administrative layers of approval,
combined with actions that are inconsistent with Bank guidelines, such as the one used under this
project, can delay the tendering process significantly. The Bank and GOI need to address the
causes of procurement problems in India. Since the problems are pervasive in most sectors of the
economy the solution is outside the scope of a single project.

OIL INDIA PETROLEUM PROJECT
_________ _________________
PROJECT IMPLEM1ENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT FROM OILiPERSPECTIVE(ICR PART-II)
---------------------------------------------------------
a)      During the Project preparation stage,  experienced  teams
from the Bank made a number of visits to the Company's offices at
Delhi,  Rajasthati  and the North East and held several rounds  of
discussions  with  OIL personnel.   All such  discussions  proved
highly  beneficial in the formulation of the Project and made  it
acceptable under all reasonably expected scenarios.
As expected, the Bank not only had definite sets of
guidelines for the borrower to follow, but at the same time was
ready   with   sufficient  advice  and  assistance   during   the
implementation stage of the Project. This was particularly so in
the procurement of materials and services' i.e. in preparation of
tender    documents,    in    finalising    detailed    technical
Hpnecifications,  etc.   Tih  Bank rcontributed in meeting the needs
of the Company ljy helpirig to identify suitable sources for its
specialised services and equipment and thus support transfer of
technology.
The  Bank gave valuable assistance to the Company in  its
efforts to increase production from its mature fields through the
application of more effective production techniques as well as to
improve the effectiveness of the Company's exploration activities
by  strengthening its technical capabilities.   The Bank was able
to support the Company as it expanded its exploration activities
into   new  areas  of  more  complex  geology  and  also  in  the
application  of  new  technologies  in  enhancing oil  production
from partially depleted fields. Specific mention must be made of
the assistance given by the Bank in the selection of appraisal
drilling wells and the areas for carrying out 3-D survey work.
in  additionr to ammiHtiring iti ensuring the  implementation
of an efficient hydrocarbon exploration programme,the Bank also
had  an  important role in Rtipporting the  Company  in   ensuring
optimum exploitation and utilisation of the crude oil and natural
gas reserves.
The Bank contributed in meeting the needs of the Company
in improving its technical capabilities and field operations
through training, engagement of specialised consultants and
contractor services.   The Bank also assisted in the introduction
of new technology, equipment, and materials as part of the
production improvement schemes, and in improving the Coii1pany's
research and development work.



24
The monitoring of the Pr^Ject implementation schedule  by
the various Bank Supervisory Missions was quite effective and it
also helped the Company in identifying the crucial areas which
were then prioritised for gaining maximum benefit.
Thus   the   role   played  by  the   Bank,  in   Project
implementation arrangements and overall support given to the
borrower towards the successful completion of the Project was
highly satisfactory from OIL's point of view. Moreover, the Bank
identified   the  areas  where  the  borrower  needed  Government
support, ehanges of Govern.ment policies etc., and effectively
pursued Oith the GOI for giving such suport.
b)     What was originally projected to be the Company's expected
performance  at  the  end of the  Project  terminal  year,   i.e.
attaining a peak production level of 4.75 mat in 1994, was mainly
based on the data available and the prevailing circumstances
during the preparation of the Staff Appraisal Report on the
Project in February, 1987.
Subsequently most of the geological data had to be
revised and upgraded on the basis of new information and analysis
of reservoir characteristics acquired during implementation of
the Project and as a result the drilling programes had to be
altered drastically. The EOR schemes originally planned, were
reviewed and restricted to Pilot-scale projects after evaluating
their viability. The infill drilling program underwent major
changes  and there were drastic cut backs in   most of the fields
except Jorajan, because of discouraging results from intial
wells.   All  of  the  above,  in  conjunction  with  some  major
environmental  factors,  had an  adverse  impact  on the   actual
performance  of  the Company.   The Company also suffered due  to
loss of trained and experienced manpower, particularly in the
drilling discipline.
The Company nevertheless gained in stature and confidence
as the Project progressed, benefiting from its association with
the  Bank,  and  ploughed  through  with  most  of  the   Project
requirements.   As  a  consequence it has been  able to  increase!
crude oil production from the rate of 2.45 mmt in 1987-88 to a
rate  of  2.90 mmt at the end of  the  Project  period.   Another
significant achievement has been in the development of an optimum
gas utilisation framework comprising of the development of a
reinjection,  storage  and  flowback system  and  associated  gas
gathering systefys, all of which have contributed to the reduction'
of gas flaring, from 35% of total production in-1987 to 19% of
the production, today.
One   factor  that  proved  to be a  major  deterrent and
ultimately had long term cosequences on the Company's performancn
was the external environment in most of its operating areas in
the North East.   It may be mentioned that most of the industrial
organisations of the region suffered badly on this account.



25
Other  external  factor  that  affected   the   Company's
performance were procurement delays beoause of cumbersome Govt.
clearances, specially after the devaluation of the rupee when
Government policies were not firm and a lot of orders for
materials  got held up.  There were contradictory directives from
the Govt. which created considexl>_e problems in evaluation of
tenders, etc. As for instance, the Govt. banned the procurement
from a JapaneRe Consortium, which the Bank did not agree and
consequently a number of purchases got delayed considerably. This
was the main reason due to which a few of the Project components
could not be completed to the fullest extent within the Project
period.
As a result of the experience gathered by the Company in
the preparation and implementation of the just concluded Project,
OIL  is  in a position to take up such future Projects  with  the
Bank assistance much more confidently and implement them with
much less hassles.
c)     During the project evolution,  the interaction between the
Bank and the Company was, as already mentioned, quite effective.
However,   during  the  Project  implementation  stage  a
greater impact could have been'accrued if the Bank Supervisory
Missions had made more frequent visits to the Company's field
headquarters   at  Duliajan,  more so during the fag end  of  the
Project. This would have gone a long way in obtaining the Bank's
speedy clearances of various procurement formalities and would
have lent greater support in reaching agreements on various
factors particularly the technical issues, related to the Project
implementation  and evaluation.   This,  we believe,  would  have
helped in taking immediate corrective actions, whenever required.
Notwithstanding  the same,  the relationship between the Bank and
OIL during the implementation phase was very constructive.
d)      There was considerable delay on the part of a consultant,
M/s  Robertson  ERC,  U..K.,  in submitting its  final  report  on
reservoir engineering studies of the NHK and Moran oil fields.
This  had a serious impact on the project schedule  and  drilling
and production improvement programmes related to the report had
to  be  modified.  lAlso,  as already mentioned,  the result   of
initial infill drilling, based on their recommendation was highly
discouraging.
The supply of a gas compressor package by a contractor,
M/s Atlas Copco (I) Ltd., was delayed considerably, which led to
rescheduling of the gas compressor commissioning programme in the
gas utilisation scheme.



26
While the performance of '4-e charter hire contractors for
drilling was quite upto mark, the same was not the case with the
contracts awarded for man-management services for both drilling
and   workover  operations.    This  too  affected  the   Project
implementation schedule considerably. In this connection, it may
be mentioned that   probably aui-to the prevailing  environmental
situation, parties with very limited experience and resources
only offered such services and the outcome was consequently poor.
Besides the above and a few other delays in the supply of
materials,   the  overall  role of  contractors  and  consultants
proved satisfactory in attaining Project objectives.
e)      A summation of the benefits of the Project to the Company
in  quantita'tive  and  financial  terms is  given  in  the  three
enclosed tables, namely, Table-C (Project activity and reserve
additions - proved plus probable), Table-D (Annual production of
oil  and  gas  attributable  to  the  Project  and  OIL's   total
production)   and  Table-H (Financial results of the  Project  to
OIL) respectively.
f)     Because of the tripatriate agreement between the Bank, the
Company and the Govt. of India, there were substantial delayR
before the Company was able to get reimbursement against the Bank
loan for expenditures it had already incurred.   As a result, the
Company lost substantial amounts in interest payment.
Future funding agreements should be in such a manner that
the finance, instead of being routed through the Govt. of India,
is disbursed to the Company directly so that the full amount is
made available without delays and the consequent interest loss is
avoided.
The introduction of a free pricing policy by the Govt. in
place  of  the  present administered prices  in  respect  of  the
Company's products, in line with the new liberisation policies,
would have helped to augment the Company's resource mobilisation
capabilities considerably. The overall benefits thus, would have
reflected itself both in terms of quantitative and financial
gains.   The fact that the Bank has been impressing upon the  GOI
the necessity of either allowing market determined pricing or
more  remunerative  prices in line with prevailing'  international
rates, is appreciated.
There  Ls good scope for taking up follow-up projects  by
the Company with the assistance of the Bank and a preliminary
proposal  has already been made by the Company to the  Bank.   We
look fdkward to having further mutual discussions in this
respect.
