IMIDRANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCrION AND
DEVELPMKNT TO THE EEMCUTIVE DISECI0RS CH A
PRIPOSED LOAN TO INDIA FOR THE
OIL INDIA LIMITED (OIL) PETROLEUM PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to India for US$140 million
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be at the standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year grace
period. The Government of India (GOI) will relend the proceeds of the loan to
Oil India Limited (OIL) for a maximum period of 15 years including five years
grace and at an interest rate of not less than 15% per annum. G0I will bear
the foreign exchange and the interest rate risks.
Background
2.       Over the past three decades, India has been shifting away from the
use of noncommercial fuels, such as fuelwood and vegetable waste, to
commercial energy resources. Much of the substitution for noncommercial fuels
has been in the form of coal and oil products, reflecting India' s large coal
resources, on the one hand, and the rapid grcwth of road transport, on the
other, which has almost doubled the use of petroleum products over the past
decade. As a result, noncommercial fuels currently account for less than 40%
of total energy consumption, while coal accounts for 32%, oil and gas for
about 20%, and primary electricity for 8%.
3.       Concerned about the adverse impact of energy shortages on economic
growth, GOI has nearly doubled the energy sector's share of the public
investments between 1973/74 and the present. A substantial portion of these
additional resources was used to accelerate the developnent of India's oil and
gas resources. Through these efforts, India reduced its reliance on imported
oil from 66% in 1973/74 to about 25Z in 1985/86.
4.       This increase in oil production has been due to the rapid development
of the giant Bombay High offshore field.  However, the production from this
field, which accounts for two-thirds of current oil production, has now
reached its peak and will start to fall by the early 1990's. India's oil
output will therefore gradually decline over the next decade unless new
reserves are identified and produced. Realizing the large investments
required in oil and gas exploration and development, India has encouraged
private sector investments to complement its efforts and, over the past seven
years, made three exploration acreage offerings to the international oil
industry (IOC). The first two offerings solicited very little response;
however, the most recent offering (Third Round), launched in May 1986, has
solicited twelve bids from seven international companies, for nine of the 27
offshore blocks offered. The bids are presently under evaluation. As part of
its ef^rts to conserve and promote efficient use of energy, the Government
has maintained average domestic petroleum consumer prices substantially above
import costs.
5.       Two public sector companies, the Oil and Natural Gas Camission
((NGC) and Oil India Limited, currently undertake petroleum exploration and
production activities in India. ONGC had, and will continue to have, the
largest involvement in the petroleum sector accounting at present for about
90% of the domestic petroleum exploration and production activities. OIL
accounts for the remaining 10% of petroleum exploration and production; it is



- 2 -
well managed, and has a small, but highly competent group of technical and
management staff.
Project Objectives
6.       The objectives of the project are to increase production from the
partially depleted Assam oil fields (map IBRD No. 19888R); to improve the
utilization, and thereby reduce the flaring of associated natural gas; to
implement efficient exploration programs in OIL's new petroleum exploration
license areas (map IBRD No. 19889), as well as encourage exploration in gas-
prone areas; and to strengthen OL's technical and institutional capabilities.
Project Description
7.       The project comprises:  (a) application of production improvement
schemes sucih as infill drilling, pressure maintenance, workover of wells and
implementation of three enhanced oil recovery (EOR) field pilots in some of
the partially depleted oil fields in Assam; (b) implementation of a gas re-
injection scheme and associated gas supply network in oil fields in Assam;
(c) exploration in OIL's new (and ;as-prone) exploration area in Rajasthan and
for deep gas in the Kumchsi area Il of Arunachal Pradesh, involving
acquisition and interpretation of high resolution seismic data and drilling of
a limited number (about ten) of exploratory wells; and (d) strengthening OIL's
technical and institutional capabilities through technical assistance,
training and the purchase of equipnent for research and development. The
project would be implemented over a period of approximately seven years. The
project implenentation arrangements are satisfactory.
8.       The total financing required for the project is about US$584 million,
of which about US$259 million (44%) will be in foreign exchange. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursements, as well as the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events, and the
status of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. Two maps (IBRD No. 19888R and IBRD No. 19889) showing the
project areas are also attached. The staff appraisal report (Report number
6464-IN) dated February 10, 1987 is being distributed separately.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
9.       The project is in line with the Bank's objectives for providing
support to India's petroleum sector designed to:  (a) accelerate development
of domestic energy resources as a replacement for oil imports and to relieve
energy shortage; (b) encourage an enlarged role of the private sector and
mobilize external financing for exploration and development; (c) support the
transfer of modern petroleum technology and oil field practices, as well as
improve the field operations and technical capabilities of the national oil
companies; and (d) promote the efficient use of energy through appropriate
pricing policies.
I/     The Kumchai area included in this project is in the State of Arunachal
Pradesh, part of which is subject of a dispute with China; however, the
project area is outside the Chinese claim.



- 3 -
10.      During the preparation of this project, the Dank used its contacts
with the international oil companies to ascertain their views and concerns
about previous efforts by GOI (e.g., the first and second round exploration
acreage offerings) to attract IOC's to explore in India. This infomation,
coupled with the Bank's experience with exploration promotion efforts by ott1er
countries, provided the basis for the Bank's infommal advice to GOI on the
terms, conditions, types of acreage, and approach to the IOC's during the
third offering. The positive response of the IOC's to the Third Round, at a
time when worldwide exploration activities are on a downward trend, reflects
the substantial steps taken by GOI to offer competitive tenme and acreages.
Through this project, the Bank would also assist OIL at a critical period as
it shifts and expands its activities into exploration for gas, as well as in
new areas of more complax geology; applies new technologies for increasing oil
recovery and the utilization of associated gas; and intensifies its technical
training and acquisition of modern technology.
Agreed Actions
11.      Tn addition to the financing, reporting, auditing, safety as well as
enviromaental protection convenants, the following were also agreed with the
Goverment and OIL:
(a) Frao the Goverment that it will:
(i) periodically review the progress of its ongoing study of gas
development and utilization options for the gas in Assan with
the Bank during the implementation of this project; (ii) fram
time to time, carry out a review of the prices of crude oil and
natural gas paid to OIL and shall set such prices at a level
that will enable OIL to meet its operating expenses and earn a
sufficient rate of return on its assets employed in operations,
meet its debt service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital, and finance a substantial portion of its proposed
capital investments; and (iii) the execution of a subsidiary
loan agreement between GOI and OIL with terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
(b) From OIL that it will:
Ci) use specialized consultants as needed for drilling, well
coapletion, production testing and well logging service under
the project; (ii) with respect to the exploration components,
will not proceed with any major modifications to the agreed well
locations and drilling program without giving the Bank a
reasonable opportunity to comment on it; (iii) prior to drilling
any exploratory well, undertake all the necessary pre-drilling
studies and surveys aad then prepare a detailed drilling program
including a well casing policy and a preliminary completion
program, which will be reviewed with the Bank; (iv) with respect
to infill and development wells, OIL shall prepare for each
field a well casing policy and a completion program amd take
into account Bank's comments on these prior to implementation;
and (v) submit annually to the Government a report containing an
analysis of its financial situations, including a financial
evaluation of the entire project and or any subsequent major
investments, which will indicate the level of prices which would
be required by OIL to earn reasonable profits and returns on its
asseta.

Project Justification and Benefits
12.      The project will result in increased domestic production of crude
oil, as well as utilization of associated gas that could otherwise be flared,
thus reducing the mount of foreign exchange which must be spent on oil
imports. The production improvement schemes will yield incremental production
of some 20 million tons of oil over the twenty-year project life. The net
present value of this incremental oil production is about US$669 million (an
ERR of 94%). The net present value of the associated gas re-injection
component is estimated at about US$65 million (ERR of about 47%).
13.      The enhanced oil recovery (ECR) pilots are not expected to contribute
significantly to production but are expected to lead to full scale use of EWR
in the 1990s, which would further increase production. The benefits of the
exploration component are difficult, at this early stage, to quantify.
However, exploration risk analyses show that the estimated expected
recoverable gas reserves in the Kumchai area is about 18 billion cubic meters
(equivalent to about 15 million tons of oil). In Rajasthan, assuming all the
hydrocarbon discovered will be gas, initial estimates of recoverable gas range
fran 2 to 42 billion cubic meters. The project will also yield other,
unouantifiable benefits, in the form of the strengthened institutional
capabilities of Oil India Limited.
Project Risks
14.      No unusual risks are foreseen and provisions have been made in the
design of the project to contain those risks which are nonmally associated
with petroleun exploration and development, i. e., geological, technological,
and coaercial.  Geological ad technological risks will be minimized by using
modern seismic technology, drilling a limited number of exploratory wells,
introducing qualified and experienced service companies, using adequate
technical assistance and training, and following oil industry safety and
environmental protection standards. There will be no forest clearance. OL
has maintained an excellent safety record in drilling and has exercised
prudent reservoir management. A long lasting decline in international oil
prices would reduce the economic benefits of the production improvement and
gas re-injection schemes. However, based on the low cost of oil ad gas
production under the project, the price of oil would have to drop to about
US$6.00 per barrel before these major project components became uneconomic.
Hence, the economic, technical and environmental risks are considered
acceptable.
Recommendation
15.      I a satisfied that the proposed loan would comply wi th the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recummend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
