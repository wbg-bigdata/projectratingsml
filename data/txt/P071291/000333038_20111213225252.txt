SUMMARY
1.      This restructuring paper seeks approval to cancel undisbursed funds across all categories
except incremental operating cost of US$ 25,000 (cumulative amount of SDR 46,087.31). The
reason for cancellation of funds is due to lack of progress in the remaining activities under the
project due to various procurement related issues – this cancellation is being proposed based on the
request of the government – the request letters dated November 25, 2011 and December 2, 2011
received from the Ministry of Finance.



PROJECT STATUS
2.     This project was co-financed with DFID and IFC. After seven years of implementation, the
project (IDA) was 94% disbursed as at October 31, 2011. The Implementation Progress and
Development Objectives of the project were downgraded in July 2010 to “Moderately
Unsatisfactory?. This unsatisfactory performance resulted in DFID deciding to close their assistance
early. The Bank restructured the project in January 2011 by downsizing components on the basis of
what could be realistically achieved within the remaining project period.

With regard to individual project components, the status is as follows:

(i)     Restructuring the two big state-controlled banks: The targeted outcomes for the
restructuring of Nepal Bank Limited (NBL) and Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB), both state controlled
banks, have been largely achieved. Both banks, which were incurring operating losses, have been
turned around with positive cash flows over the last seven years. Non-performing loans have been
brought down from 58% for NBL and 60% for RBB in mid-July 2003 to 5.3 % and 10.9 %,
respectively as of mid-July 2011. Staff levels have been reduced by more than 40% in both NBL
and RBB. Branches covering more than 80 % of the deposit base are now computerized. Quarterly
financial statements are now published in less than a month from quarter ends. As these banks were
considered technically ready for the next steps of restructuring. a new activity was added in the last
restructuring paper, which involved a detailed diagnostic assessment of NBL to assist the GON to
make decisions regarding the next steps for this bank. However, the procurement process was
significantly delayed that resulted in not meeting milestones agreed under the Procurement Plan. The
Bank was informed of implementing agency’s inability to complete the activity within remaining
project period.

(ii)  Re-engineering Nepal Rastra Bank: For the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the re-engineering
component has not been fully achieved. The bank’s supervision capacity has improved but agreed
outcomes were not fully achieved due to the failure of NRB to recruit international supervision
                                                  4
experts. The financial disclosure standard has improved in terms of quality and timeliness. The legal
and regulatory framework has significantly improved although amendments to Banks and Financial
Institutions Act remain pending in the Parliament.

(iii) Capacity Building in the Financial Sector: The development objective of supporting an
environment for financial sector reform has been partly achieved. Public awareness of the reform
program has increased significantly and the quality of financial news1 reporting improved. The
training for NRB staff in reputed institutions has been successfully implemented and the training
program was closed with the closure of DFID grant on March 31, 2011.With the re-establishment of
the Credit Information Centre Limited (CICL) as a private institution, it is functioning more
efficiently with quick turn-around in availability of credit reports. Procurement of a new MIS to
upgrade CICL ran into problem when the amounts quoted in the financial bids significantly
exceeded the budget of NRB and hence the bid was cancelled. Given the inadequate time within
project period for another round of bidding process, the activity was considered for cancellation.
Similarly, in case of procuring MIS for Secured Transaction Registry Office, agreed milestone as per
Procurement Plan was not achieved and hence this activity also was considered for cancellation.



PROPOSED CHANGES
Cancellation

3.      In view of Implementing Agency’s inability to complete the remaining activities within the
project period, the Government has made a request for cancellation of undisbursed funds, except for
Incremental Operating Cost not exceeding USD 25,000. The cancelled funds would amount to SDR
1,198,977.84 and will be recommitted to another program in Nepal within the current fiscal year.


Closing date

4.       There is no change in the closing date, which remains December 31, 2011.

  Improvement in the quality of financial news reporting is evidenced through greater factual content, accuracy and
substance in articles that appear in the press today. At the start of the project period, financial news reports usually
lacked depth and focus. Greater emphasis was placed on financial scandals and controversy. Investigative journalism,
as in the case of Unity Life reported in May 2010, has also led to regulatory action.
