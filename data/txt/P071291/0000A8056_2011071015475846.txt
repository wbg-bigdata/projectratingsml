                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was restructured with Board approval on April 1, 2011 and a revised Development Credit Agreement was counter-signed by the Government on May 20, 2011.

                         The restructuring entailed cancellation of all activities that were no longer considered feasible. The remaining components are (a) automation of the Credit Information Center Limited

                         completed within the project period, i.e. end-December 2011 and that no further extensions would be considered.

                         The procurement process for purchase of equipment for CICL concluded with the opening of the financial bid wherein the amount exceeded the estimated budget. As a result, the
                         Nepal Rastra Bank#s Board, cancelled the bidding process for CICL. A re-bid at this stage is considered unfeasible. Whilst there has been tremendous effort to make operational the
                         automation of STR, including a stakeholders' workshop at the Ministry of Finance and a review of STR law/regulations by experts who recommended necessary changes and
                         amendments, unfortunately, the procurement process has not progressed and is unlikely to meet the timetable as per the Procurement Plan. Similarly, the procurement process for
                         conducting the diagnostic study of the NBL has been delayed, and is unlikely to meet the agreed time tables as per the Procurement Plan.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the delays in the procurement process for all the remaining activities under the restructured project, and the very low probability that activities will be completed within the
                         project period, an early closure of the project is under consideration.
