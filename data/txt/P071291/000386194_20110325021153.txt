7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overarching objective of the Reform Program in the Financial Sector is to support the renewed efforts
of the Government of Nepal (GON) to improve the sector in order to bring macroeconomic stability and
promote private-sector-led economic growth. Specifically, the Project focuses on : (a) helping to
restructure and re-engineer the Central Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank - NRB), so that it can effectively perform
its key central banking functions; (b) commencing commercial banking reform in the two large ailing
commercial banks that dominate the sector (Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL))
-- by introducing stronger bank management that protects the financial integrity of the two banks and
would take on a conservator role to prepare the banks for the next steps of restructuring; and (c) supporting
a better environment for financial sector reform in areas such as enhanced credit information, better
financial news reporting, and better training for staff in financial institutions.



7b. Revised Project Development Objectives/Outcomes [if applicable]

Assist the Borrowers in (i) developing capacity of Nepal Rastra Bank staff to effectively perform key
central banking functions; (ii) implementing restructuring program of Rastriya Banijya Bank and carrying
out diagnostic review of Nepal Bank Limited, to prepare these state-owned commercial banks for the next
steps of restructuring; and (iii) creating an enabling environment for financial sector development,
specifically in the area of credit information bureau, secured transaction registry and financial news
reporting.

           FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT

                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

 The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project has been adversely im pacted by
successive changes in governm ent and the post-conflict tran sition, which has resulted in
an extremely difficult political environment for reforms in the banking sector. In light of
this, the Restructuring Paper seeks approval from the Board of Executive Directo rs for
cancellation of som e of the project activities and seeks approval for changes in the
Project Developm ent Objective, Re sults Fr amework and Monitoring, Project Costs,
Financing Plan and P rocurement Plan. Th e activities that are being proposed for
continuation are progressing we ll an d are expected to ach ieve proje ct ob jectives within
the existing project period.

B. PROJECT STATUS

This project is co-financed with DFID and IFC. After seven years of implementation, the
project (IDA) was 86.5 % disbursed and 1.4 % comm itted as at Octob er 31, 2010. The
Implementation Progress and Development Objectives of the project were downgraded in
July 2010 to Moderately Unsatis factory. This unsatisfactory performance has resulted in
DFID deciding to close their assistance early.

With regard to individual project components, the status is as follows:

(i)     Restructuring the two big state-controlled banks: The targeted ou tcomes for
the restructuring of Nepal Bank Lim ited (NBL) and Rastriya Ba nijya Bank (RBB), both
state con trolled bank s, have been largel y achieved. Both banks, which were incur ring
operating losses, have been tu rned around with posit ive cash flows over the last seven
years. Non-perform ing loans have been brought down from 58% for NBL and 60% for
RBB in mid-July 2003 to 4.8 % and 11.9 %, resp ectively as of m id-October 2010. Staff
levels have been reduced by m ore than 40% in both NBL a nd RBB. Br anches covering
more than 80 % of the depos        it base are n ow com puterized. Quarterly financial
statements are now published in less than a m onth from quarter ends. T hese banks are
considered technically ready for the next      steps of restructuring. However, the B ank
Restructuring Advisor (for priv atization) was not recruited du e to lack of clear buy-in on
the privatization strategy.

(ii)     Re-engineering Nepal Rastra Bank: For th e Nepal Rastr a Bank (NRB), the re-
engineering component has not been fully achieved. The bank's supervision capacity has
improved but agreed outcom es we re not full y achiev ed d ue to th e f ailure of NRB to
recruit international supervision experts. The financial disclosure standard has im proved
in terms of quality and timeliness. The lega l and regulatory framework has significantly
improved although am endments to Banks and Financial Institutions Act remain pending
in the Parliament.

                                             4
(iii) Capacity Building in the Financial Sector: The developm ent objective of
supporting an environment for financial sector reform has been partly achieved. With the
re-establishment of the Credit I    nformation Bureau as a priva te institution, it is
functioning m ore efficiently with quick turn-around in ava ilability of credit reports.
Public awareness of the reform program has increased sign ificantly an d the quality of
financial news 1 reporting im proved. The training for NRB staf f in rep uted in stitutions
has been successfully implem ented and the training program is proposed to continue
through March 31, 2011.

In light of the above, the following changes are being proposed.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

    Project's Development Objectives

    The original PDO:
    The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower in: (i) restructuring and re-
    engineering the Nepal Rastra Bank for it to effectively perform key central banking
    functions; (ii) implementing reforms in the commercial banking sector that will focus
    initially on restructuring Rastriya Banijya Bank and Nepal Bank Limited; and (iii)
    improving the environment for financial sector reforms in areas such as credit
    information and financial news reporting through specialized training and capacity
    building.

    The PDO that was recorded in the Rest ructuring Paper sub mitted in M ay 2008 was
    inadvertently extrac ted f rom the original Project Approval Docum ent (PAD) whic h
    was set at a program level and not at the pr oject level. The P DO in the Restructuring
    Paper of May 2008 reads as:          The objective continues to be to support the
    government's efforts to achieve a sound and efficient financial sector in support of
    macroeconomic stability and a private sector-led economy.

    The proposed new PDO is to assist the Borrower in : (i) developing capacity of Nepal
    Rastra Bank staff to effectively perform key central banking functions; (ii)
    implementing restructuring program of Rastriya Banijya Bank and carrying out
    diagnostic review of Nepal Bank Limited, to prepare these state-owned commercial
    banks for the next steps of restructuring; and (iii) creating an enabling environment
    for financial sector development, specifically in the area of credit information bureau,
    secured transaction registry and financial news reporting.




1
  Improvement in the quality of financial news reporting is evidenced through greater factual content,
accuracy and substance in articles that appear in the press today. At the start of the project period, financial
news reports usually lacked depth and focus. Greater emphasis was placed on financial scandals and
controversy. Investigative journalism, as in the case of Unity Life reported in May 2010, has also led to
regulatory action.
                                                       5
Project Scope

Given the changing authorizing environm ent for banking reforms in Nepal, and recent
track record in im plementation, it is proposed to reduce the scope of the project. The
Restructured Project aim s to f ocus on the f ollowing activ ities: (a) ass ist the Centra l
Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank ­ NRB) build cap          acity throug h tra ining; (b) con tinue
reforms in one state controlled com mercial bank ­ Rastriya Banijya Bank ­ through
on-going assistance and supporti ng a diagnostic assessm ent of the other state
controlled comm ercial bank ­ Nepal Bank L imited; and (c) create an enab ling
environment for financial sector devel opment through im proved Credit Inform ation
Centre Ltd, establishm ent of a Secured Tr ansaction Registry, and i mproved financial
news reporting.

Components are being down-size d, based on what can be realistically achieved within
the remaining project period. In particul ar, the following activi ties under IDA/DFI D
funding are being dropped:

Component 1: Re-engineering of Nepal Rastra Bank

i.      Supervision Expert ­ Recruitm ent of international expe rts to streng then
        NRB's supervision departm ents have sta lled; the Fund has ag reed to provide
        two Resident Advisors for one year to strengthen the Bank Supervision and FI
        Supervision Departments. Further as sistance could be pr ovided under FIRST
        initiative, if requested by NRB.

ii.     Human Resource Expert ­ Following the completion of contract of HR Expert
        who prepared new policy/m anuals, NRB has not hired another expert for
        implementation. They plan to utilize in -house expertise to strengthen the HR
        function at NRB.

iii.    Procurement Expert ­ As no new procur ement activity is being planned under
        this project, NRB does not see the need for hiring an expert.

iv.     Public Relations Officer ­ NRB has indi cated the use of its own resources for
        this position.

Component 2: Management Contracts for restructuring NBL & RBB

i.      CEO of Ne pal Bank Lim ited ­NBL is currently being m anaged by a three-
        member coordination team from NRB. NRB has decided not to recruit a new
        CEO using FSTA funding.

ii.     Bank Restructuring (Sales) Advisor ­ As the G overnment is still undecided
        about the ultim ate disposition of govern ment shares in NBL and RBB, NRB
        decided not to hire the Bank Restructuring Advisor.

Component 3 : Other Financial Sector Assistance

                                           6
i.        Debt Recovery Tribunal: As there has been no new request for continuation of
          support for procuring goods and training, this activity is being dropped.

The following activity is being added to component 2:

     i.      Diagnostic Assessment of NBL: NRB has decided to conduct a fast track
             detailed diagnostic assessment of NBL that would assist the GON to m ake
             decisions regarding the next restru cturing steps for this bank. The due
             diligence is proposed to be carried out by a joint venture of a Nepalese and
             an international firm.


Results/Indicators

     In light of the above changes, the resu lts fram ework is being revised with both
indicators and targets linked to the rest of the project scope. Please refer to Annex 1
for details.

Based on the revised cost estim ates, this would result in a ca ncellation of GBP 1.964
million from the DFID Grant and SDR 615,000 under the IDA Credit.

 With the above changes the proposed category wise allocations are attached as per
 annex 2 of this report. It is proposed th at the cancelled SDR 615,000 be reallocated to
 other priorities within the Nepal program.


 Closing date

 There is no change in IDA closing date. However funding from DFID Trust Fund is
 being closed on March 31, 2011, a nd the rem aining activities have been sequenced
 such that project activities are completed within the project period.

 Implementation

 A revised implem entation plan has been discussed and a new procurem ent plan
 submitted. IDA has r eviewed th e plans and f inds them satisf actory. The revise d
 procurement plan is shown under Annex 3.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

 The proposed changes w ill not change the En vironmental Category nor w ill it change
 the economic or social assessm      ents. Th e financial assessm ent related to the
 accumulated losses in NBL and RBB indicate th at the Government's fiscal burden for
 recapitalizing the two banks have been reduced by NPR 13.2 billio n (US$ 183
 million) as both th e banks are making operating profits which have improved the ne t
 worth position in the two banks from a ne gative NPR 27.1 billion (US $ 375 million)
 as of July 2003 to a negative NPR 13.9 bil lion (US$ 193 million) as of October 17,
 2010.

 Implementation arrangements remain unchanged as there is a renewed co nfidence that
 dropping of some of the com ponents will facilitate implementation and the remaining
 components are technically f easible to com plete with in the project period. T he
 financial management and procurement arrangement will remain the same.

 Risk

 Some of the critica l risks identified during earlier appraisa l continue to rem ain valid
 and hence the need to d ownsize project components. The major risks as sociated with
 the remaining project components are:

     1. Delay in projec t im plementation ar ising from com plex procurem ent
        procedures. Both the credit information system and movable collateral registry
        require procurem ent of modern m anagement infor mation system com prising
        sophisticated hardware and software. Preparation of RFP, bi dding documents
        and evaluation require expertise in       und erstanding o f the tech nical
        requirements of the system . This risk is being addresse d through an IFC
        support to the respective im    plementing agencies during preparation of
        technical requirement and technical evaluation of bids.
                                           9
2. Implementing agency officials conti nue to be reluctant about making
   procurement decisions for fear of       being charged by the Comm ission for
   Investigation of A buse of Authority (or sim ilar anti-graft institution s) f or
   corruption. This risk should be m inimized by following Bank procurem ent
   guidelines strictly and keeping the pro cess highly transparent. Recruitment of
   a consultin g f irm f or carry ing ou t due d iligence of NBL is high in the
   government priority and the Bank would provide expertise in expediting the
   procurement process.
