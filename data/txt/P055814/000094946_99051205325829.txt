A: Project Development Objective
A.1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The major development objective is to enhance the ability of Tunisian private exporters to integrate into
the global economy. The proposed project would foster export competitiveness of Tunisian firms by
mitigating some of the disadvantages they encounter relative to their foreign competitors (for example,
export-related transactions costs and export financing problems for small and medium exporters).

B: Strategic Context
B. 1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 15799-TUN       Date of latest CAS discussion: June 25, 1996
By aiming to create new market opportunities overseas (through the export market access component),
increase availability of preshipment finance for small and/or first-time exporters (through the preshipment
export finance guarantee component), and reduce transaction costs (through the trade facilitation
component), the proposed project addresses a key CAS objective; namely, enhancing the ability of
enterprises to compete on an equal footing with foreign companies, and modernizing services that
improve trade efficiency.
B.2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Tunisia is facing significant competitive challenges as a result of accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and the Free Trade Association (FTA) with the EU. At the same time, it has set
high growth targets in its Ninth Development Plan, calling for enhanced internal and external
competitiveness and increased market shares abroad, both in existing export-oriented sectors and in new
activities, including services. The country's export performance has been commendable in recent years
(thanks to the offshore sector), but traditional exports are now facing severe competition in a changing
global environment. For example, the growth of manufactured exports in real terms has declined from
12.8 percent p.a. during 1987-91 to 4.0 percent p.a. during 1992-97. In addition, Tunisia's share has

Country: Tunisia                                                     Project Title: Export Development Project
fallen in traditional export markets in some of its key export products, in favor of a number of emerging
competitors. For example, in men's and boy's clothing, Tunisia's share in the EU's imports has increased
from 1.0 percent to 1.4 percent during 1988-97, while China's share has increased from 3.8 percent to
11.7 percent during the same period. The recent currency depreciation and collapse of domestic demand
in Southeast Asia is also adding to the competitive pressure in key export markets.1
There are two key issues: (a) the success of the offshore sector exports is being undermined by intense
competition from other emerging economies in Tunisia's traditional markets; and (b) the onshore sector
has not developed export production and marketing capabilities, and will soon be exposed to severe
competition from imports due to the FTA with the EU.
Recent enterprise surveys (detailed results available in project files) by Tunisian counterparts, as well as
the Bank team, have revealed the following:
CONSTRAINTS TO EXPORTS
A. THE NEED FOR PRODUCTION AND MARKETING ASSISTANCE:
*   Onshore firms seriously undervalue production and marketing assistance to help them establish contacts with export
outlets and conclude export sales.
*   Firms have made little investnent to enter export markets (product quality, marketing, etc.).
*   Firms, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the onshore sector, have very limited export experience; they
need assistance with information on potential markets and appropriate market segments, quality and price standards in
these market segments, and potential supply chain intermediaries.
*   There is a weak overseas buyer connection.  The majority of exports are to a single buyer, usually through
subcontracting arrangements.
*   There is a weak exporter link to domestic producers.
B. THE NEED FOR PRESHIPMENT EXPORT FINANCE:
*   The majority of the firms interviewed, in particular SMEs, expressed concems about access to working capital for
export production, even when they had confirmed letters of credit from foreign buyers.
C THE NEED TO SIMPLIFY EXPORTAND IMPORT PROCEDURES:
*   Multiple procedures and steps are involved in trade activity; it takes an average of 7 to 8 days for customs clearance of
goods for a company that is a partial exporter. A competitor in France, supplying the same goods and services, can
effect customs clearance within hours.
D. THE NEED TO REDUCE TRANSPORTAND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS:
*   Marine transport costs (to France or Germany) for a 20-foot container are the highest in North Africa, and almost equal
to transport costs from China and India to these markets.
Export production and marketing weaknesses. The existing and potential exporters in Tunisia -
typically small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) - face challenges in entering export markets.
This especially applies to onshore firms, but also to offshore firmns involved mainly in subcontracting
arrangements, which aim to develop arms-length exports. These firms have to: (a) identify the right
target market, product segment, and selling channel; (b) learn how to adapt their products for these
markets; (c) understand their competitors; (d) launch a marketing and selling campaign; and
(e) deliver the product on time and collect on sales. These activities require significant investments,
not only in terms of financial resources, but also in skilled and scarce managerial resources. They are
also information intensive and often require years to understand the market. All these efforts have to
be undertaken in an environment where many firms already have to cope with existing problems such
as poor infrastructure, inadequately trained work force, delays in securing inputs, complying with
procedural requirements, and accessing credit from a conservative banking system. The public export
promotion agency is concerned mainly with, and structured for, public relations and general
promotion, servicing official delegations, and responding to needs of controlling ministries rather
than to the specific needs of buyers and sellers.   Consequently, not only small and medium
producers, but also some large Tunisian subcontractors are not able to actively cultivate export
markets.

*  Lack of access to trade finance by small firms and first-time exporters. Because of their high
perceived credit risks (due in part to market imperfections such as informaltion asymmetries), SMEs
and emerging exporters have limited scope for short-term bank loans or credlit. Commercial banks in
Tunisia are hesitant to provide SME and emerging exporters with access to preshipment trade finance
based solely on confirmed letters of credit (L/C).  In addition, the export insurance agency,
Compagnie Tunisienne pour 1'assurance du commerce exterieur (COTUNACE), offers only export
credit insurance/guarantee schemes that protect exporters/banks granting export finance against
foreign buyers' nonpayment risks. There is no preshipment export finance guarantee scheme that
protects banks granting preshipment export finance against risks of exporters' manufacturing
nonperformance.
*  Weakness and timeliness of trade procedures. The average time taken to clear goods after they
have been unloaded from the vessel is 8 days - in a number of cases, it reaches as long as
18 days. The inefficient processes underlying this delay are very costly to Tunisian enterprises.
Beyond cost, the current processes severely impede the capability of Tunisian enterprises to respond
to or accept short-notice orders, negatively affecting the competitiveness of these enterprises. Prompt
and frequent delivery of small lots is increasingly the trend in exports of manufactured goods. In
order to win market shares, exporters should be able to respond to sudden orders very quickly.
Currently, responsiveness of Tunisian exporters to this market requirement is low, because order
execution cycle times are high, in part due to lengthy supply chains, cumbersome procedures, and
limited domestic infrastructure. Trading companies also find it difficult to expand their operations
because they do not have stocks on hand in the importing country to respond to short-term supply
opportunities. Even in the case of long-term buyer-seller relationships, Tunisian exporters are at a
disadvantage because they cannot meet the short delivery times specified by buyers for each order.
These problems become even more acute in the case of new markets. There are currently 19 distinct
steps involved in an import transaction and 15 steps in an export transaction (details are available in
project files). Some of these steps do not apply to the offshore companies, but an onshore enterprise
that imports raw materials and processes them into an export product has to go through 34 trade-
related steps. As a result of directives from the Superior Export Council, thlere have been significant
improvements over recent years with trade processes for offshore companies. Many of the
improvements have been attained through implementation of special procedures that apply only to
such companies. There is, however, a need to standardize the simplification processes and to
streamline procedures so that traders as a whole can benefit.
Government strategy
The Government has made significant progress in creating an open and efficient economy, and has
adopted a policy environment to improve business confidence, promote exports., and attract foreign direct
investment. It is now prepared to deepen its reform program and remove the structural constraints that
hamper efficiency and competitiveness of Tunisian private firms. In 1995, Tunisia became the first
country in the MENA region to sign an FTA with the EU, marking a major step in opening Tunisia's
economy to international competition (a process that began in 1986 and has included the country's
accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, in 1990 and its signature of the
Uruguay Round Agreement in 1994).

County: Tunisia                                          Project Title: Export Development Project
The establishment of the Superior Export Council in July 1997, presided over by President Ben Ali,
attests to the increased attention by Tunisian authorities to the critical role of exports in the country's
economic development. The Council has proposed a series of measures aimed at removing the remaining
barriers to competition in goods and services; strengthening the regulatory and incentive framework
governing external trade; improving financial sector regulations to facilitate the development and
application of modern trade finance instruments; enhancing the effectiveness and relevance of trade-
related support services in such areas as promotion and marketing, quality management, standards and
certification of products, processes and services; and enhancing possibilities for service exports. Some
measures have already been taken to grant indirect and partial exporters incentives comparable to those
for offshore firms.
B.3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The proposed project would address: (a) the insufficient export production and market access capacities;
(b) the lack of access to preshipment trade finance by small exporters; and (c) inadequate trade facilitation
mechanisms. The rationale for the strategic decision to address these issues was discussed with the GoT
during the preappraisal mission (see export strategy note in project files).
C: Project Description Summary
C.1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
With a focus on promoting public-private partnership in the context of the project, the Bank would
provide financial and technical assistance to: (a) improve access to export outlets and buyers; (b) improve
access to preshipment export finance, especially for SMEs and emerging exporters; and (c) facilitate trade
by simplifying import and export-related procedures.  The simultaneous implementation of these
components is important to the success of the project. Without having access to buyers and new markets
(and therefore export orders), small and emerging exporters would not need preshipment export
financing, and improved import and export processes would not lead to significant export growth.
Component 1: Export Market Access (Total cost US$25 million, of which IBRD would finance
US$14.0 million). This component would include a matching grant fund (Export Market Access
Fund - EMAF) to cover on a temporary basis up to 50 percent of the cost of consultant services
required to enable enterprises, especially SMEs, to enter export markets. The EMAF would offer its
services solely in response to private sector demand on a nondiscriminatory and a first-come-first-
served basis. The assistance would be provided once an export plan is developed by the enterprise
and the entrepreneur is committed to implement it. The main instruments under this scheme consist
of: (a) nonreimbursable matching grants (a total US$10 million to cover 50 percent of expenditures),
payable to beneficiaries of the EMAF for eligible activities undertaken within the framework of an
export plan (see Annex 2); (b) technical assistance to eligible enterprises in the preparation of their
export plan (an additional US$1.5 million would be available to cover 70 percent of the cost of export
plan preparation) ; and (c) technical assistance during implementation of export plans. The scheme
would be executed by an internationally experienced management team.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
Specifically, the EMAF would provide assistance for a period of three years to at least 350 SMEs,
that have been so far protected from external competition, to help thenm find foreign buyers and
outlets. In doing so, it would encourage the use of local and foreign business and export development
service providers. The EMAF would cofinance highly focused export plans and its success would be
judged by the amount of new exports that it generates (see Annex 2). It would complement the
existing programs, such as the mise-a-niveau and the Export Promotion Fund (FOPRODEX) in
preparing Tunisian firms for global competition.
The component also includes: (a) a two-year international trading company development program, to
be implemented by the Centre de promotion des exportations (CEPEX) and the Federation des
exportateurs prives (FEDEX); (b) support for a vendor development program to actively court vendor
development managers, professional buyers and buying chains, and design companies; and (c) a study
to identify operational and organizational options and management systems for a trade service center
(Maison de 1 'exportateur), based on international best practice.
Component 2: Preshipment Export Finance Guarantee (Project cost UU$6 million, of which IBRD
would finance US$5.4 million). The objective of this component is to encourage financial institutions
to provide preshipment financing (working capital) to SME and emerging exporters with viable
export contracts (holding confirmed overseas letters of credit or specifieed buyers' nonpayment risk
insurance for confirmed orders) whose perceived nonperformance risk is greater than their actual risk
because they are unable to provide adequate collateral or do not have a suitable credit history to prove
that they are creditworthy. This would be accomplished by covering a large portion of the non-
performance risk through the preshipment export finance guarantee (PEFG) scheme. Eligible
subloans financed by the PEFG facility would be guaranteed for 90 percent of the outstanding
principal amount.
Specifically, Bank resources under this component would finance a PEFG facility, established by
GoT, to guarantee preshipment export loans by participating financial institutions (PFIs) to SME and
emerging exporters. These loans would cover the input and working capital costs of producers
exporting their final products, either directly or through international trading companies, or indirect
exporters supplying to offshore companies. This facility would be aclministered by the Export
Insurance Agency (COTUNACE), and would be monitored by a Risk Agreement Committee (Comite
d 'agrement des risques -- CAR). It would guarantee 90 percent of the nonperformance risks of SME
and emerging exporters which the PFIs must bear for up to 180 days. A pr.emium of 0.15 percent per
month would be paid by the borrowers (exporters).
The facility would be available to all Tunisian SME, and ernerging exporters in all manufacturing,
processing, and service activities (except those sectors on a negative list) that are unable to access
preshipment export finance from commercial banks, provided that these exporters submit confirmed
export letters of credits L/Cs, other export orders backed by export credit insurance, back-to-back
domestic L/Cs, or international subcontract fee payment guarantees that ensure the self-liquidation of
the underlying preshipment export finance guaranteed by buyers' payment within the loan and
PEFG's maturity.

Country: Tunisia                                             Project Title: Export Development Project
Component 3: Trade Facilitation Component (Project cost US$19 million, of which IBRD would
finance US$15.3 million). The project would provide support for investments and technical assistance
required to reduce the number of procedures and the transaction costs involved in trading activity,
with special emphasis on customs procedures and electronic exchange of trade-related documents.
For this purpose, a coordinating body (Technical Committee for Trade Facilitation), consisting of
representatives of key agencies involved in trade facilitation, has recently been established to
implement the component.
The procedures for extemal trade in Tunisia require the processing of documents by the Ministry of
Commerce, banks, the port authority, and customs, as well as the usual professional organizations
such as customs brokers, shipping agents, and freight forwarders. Delays in clearance of goods are
significant for imports; the key factors that slow the process are: (a) time taken to submit and correct
shipping manifests; (b) manual processing of customs declarations; (c) lack of training of customs
staff; and (d) lack of proper equipment and facilities within customs for goods verification and
analysis.
The inefficiencies of the present practices for trade
document processing are illustrated in Figure A.             Trade document processing-
The lines indicate the document exchanges that                present situation
must be carried out physically; i.e., hardcopy                   Ctoms 
documents that have to be delivered and in some          ippig
cases, picked up again after several days for further   get
processing.
Intemational experience has shown that information      C to/f
technology can significantly assist in reducing both
costs  and  time  delays  for  trade  document                      n
processing. The lessons and experience gained from
implementation of such technologies are reflected in
the project design. The implementation of the action
plan for this component (details available in project files) would lead to simplified trade
documentation processing, as depicted in Figure B.

would deliver courses to Customs agents and
professionals within the trade community, on
modem trade facilitation techniques supported
under the project.

C.2. Project cost andfinancing:
Total project costs are tentatively estimated at US$50 miillion, with a Bank loan currently estimated at
US$34.7 million (excluding the front-end fee of US$350,000 to be financed by the proceeds of the loan).
The possibility of cofinancing for the project will be investigated with different sources.

C.3. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
*  Streamlining customs and other import/export procedures
* Adopting the preshipment export finance guarantee law
*  Building institutional capacity of COTUNACE to provide preshipment export finance guarantees
*  Building institutional capacity of CEPEX to carry out the Export Market Access Fund.
C4. Benefits and target population:
The proposed project would assist private Tunisian SME and emerging exporters and would build on the
GoT's trade reforms, initiated in the context of the FTA with the EU, through a package of micro-level
interventions designed to put Tunisian exporters on equal footing with their international competitors.
The interventions would be simple and quickly implementable to maximize the demonstration effect,
creating momentum and credibility to implement the trade promotion strategy being developed by the
GoT. The benefits of the proposed operation would be measured in accordance with the key perfornance
indicators for the project's development objectives and outputs (Annex 1). The benefits of the proposed
project correspond with traditional benefits of exporting activity, and would benefit the Tunisian people
as a whole.
Export market access. As far as the EMAF is concerned, a review conducted by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on a British export promotion scheme found that about
half of the firms, from a sample of 420 that received cost-sharing grants over a 3-year period, were later
able to use consultants at market prices, and 82 percent had begun implementing consultants'
recommendations. Information from a sample of 36 matching grant-supported activities in Indonesia
shows that the first year of implementation achieved additional exports of US$36 for every US$1 of grant
received. Creating conditions for development of international trading companies and design and
procurement offices, as well as establishing an effective trade service center (Maison de 1'exportateur),
would help to assemble major buyers of Tunisian exports and to provide them with all the necessary
information to conclude a purchase contract.
Export finance. By reducing the perceived nonperformance risks, especially for first-time exporters and
SMEs, the preshipment export finance guarantee fund would enable Tunisian exporters to exploit
business opportunities in export markets (some of which would be the result of the assistance under the
Export Market Access Component), and thereby help create jobs and productive capacity. Currently, the
majority of firms with ready access to trade finance through the banking sector are relatively large and
well established. The export guarantee scheme proposed under the project would help reduce credit risks
of trade financing for small and first-time exporters, and would therefore enhance the willingness of the
banking sector to expand the supply of trade finance. It is estimated that a US$5 million preshipment
export finance guarantee fund could generate more than US$700 million of additional exports over a
period of five years, when coordinated with the EMAF.
Trade facilitation. Trade simplification mechanisms proposed under the project would make trade-
related transactions more efficient and reliable than they are now. Improving the information exchange
between cargo handling and clearance activities (for example, electronic preclearance of imports and
exports; prescheduling of transport, containers, ports, and shipping facilities) would help to simplify and
streamline cargo clearance process, and therefore reduce the time needed to move goods through ports
and handling facilities. In addition, by simplifying and streamlining customs and inspection procedures,
the component would substantially reduce total cycle time for container movement. (Efficient trade
facilitation in Singapore was estimated to be worth over 1 percent of GDP in 1995 alone.) An additional
potential benefit would be to provide GoT with information on indirect Tunisian exports, allowing the
GoT to improve further the incentives offered to indirect exporters and to promote linkages.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
C. 5. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
C.5.1. Project implementation
The project would be implemented over a period of five years. Project completion is expected by
September 30, 2004, with a closing date of March 31, 2005. A midterm review, would be carried out by
February 2001.
The Steering Committee. The project will operate under the guidance of a recently established Inter-
Ministerial Steering Committee (SC) chaired by the Minister of Commerce and comprised of
representative from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, Ministry of Transport,
Ministry of International Cooperation, COTUNACE, CEPEX, customs, Office de marine marchande et
des ports (OMMP), and the Association of Exporters. The SC would meet twice a year, or more
frequently if needed. Members of the SC could designate other officials to act on their behalf. The SC
would facilitate project execution by eliminating blockages that could delay project implementation.
Specifically, it would: (a) monitor the overall execution of the project and recommend measures or
modifications in execution modalities, to facilitate project implementation, in line with the parameters
established under the project; and (b) provide regular progress reports to the Minister of Commerce and
the World Bank.
The Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit. The overall responsibility for project execution would be
delegated to a Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) which has been set up within the
Ministry of Commerce. The PCMU will be in charge of implementing the project in accordance with the
Project Implementation Plan. The PCMU would be headed by an experienced project coordinator
(Project Manager) designated by the Minister of Commerce and have administrative structures, processes,
and staffing conducive to efficient administration of the project. The head of PCMU would be assisted by
three other high-level staff from the Ministry of Commerce, each in charge of monitoring one component
of the project
PCMU would be a light structure without decisionmaking responsibility concerning project activities.
The parties directly involved in the project (customs, COTUNACE, CEPEIX, and the Ministry of
Commerce) would be individually responsible for decisions that affect their respective components. The
PCMU would be responsible for the preparation of monitoring reports and working documents required
by Bank supervision missions, and for the mid-term review of the project. It would ensure that budgetary,
procurement, contracting, disbursement, administrative, accounting, auditing, and reporting arrangements
are carried out in accordance with agreed procedures. The PCMU would also be in charge of organizing
Steering Committee meetings and providing all the necessary information on project performance and
monitoring to the Steering Committee and the Bank.
Technical Committee for Trade Facilitation. Given the complexity of the trade facilitation component, a
Technical Committee comprised of representatives from customs, the port authority (OMMP), and the
Ministry of Commerce would be set up to assist PCMU.
The project implementation plan, operational manuals for EMAF and PEFG, and a detailed master plan
for the trade facilitation component, have been prepared.
C.5.2. Procurement
Procurement arrangements are summarized in Annex 6. Procurement would be the responsibility of
executing agencies for each component - CEPEX, COTUNACE, and customs. Each executing agency
would organize bid evaluation for all procurement activities and constitute a consultant selection
committee.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
The major services to be procured are: (a) consultants for the EMAF management team; (b) consultant
services procured by recipients of the grants under the EMAF; and (c) consultant services required under
the trade facilitation component
A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be advertised in Development Business in May 1999.
The selection process for the EMAF management team would be completed before project effectiveness,
in accordance with Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by the World Bank
Borrowers, dated January 1997, and Tunisia's procurement procedures. The Bank has reviewed the latter
and found them satisfactory. The selection and hiring of all other consultants would be in accordance
with acceptable commercial practices consistent with Bank guidelines. As indicated in the EMAF
Operational Manual (in project files), the management team and the EMAF Steering Committee would
ensure that the services of consultants procured by the recipients of EMAF grants are provided at
reasonable cost, time, efficiency and quality. They would also ensure the competency of service
providers.
Review procedures. Civil works and equipment would be procured under trade facilitation component.
With respect to works, contracts greater than or equal to US$750,000 would require prior review (see
Annex 6, Table B). Concerning goods, all contracts greater than or equal to US$400,000 would require
prior Bank review.
All contracts for employment of (a) individual consultants costing US$50,000 or more; and (b) consulting
firns costing US$100,000 or more, would require prior Bank review. Under the EMAF, the EMAF
Steering Committee and the Bank would review the first five contracts regardless of size. Thereafter, an
ex-post review would be conducted on a selective basis. Under PEFG, the Bank would review the first
five guarantees issued. Thereafter, the PEFG agency, COTUNACE, would report to the Bank on a
quarterly basis for ex-post review.
C.5.3. Disbursement
The closing date for loan disbursements would be March 31, 2004. The loan proceeds would be
disbursed against categories shown in Annex 6.
Three special accounts would be established in the Central Bank to facilitate disbursements for individual
components. As far as the EMAF components are concerned, the authorized amount of US$1 million
would be limited to US$600,000 until the withdrawals reach US$300,000. The special accounts for these
two components would be replenished on a monthly basis, or when one-third of the balance is withdrawn,
whichever occurs first. The special accounts would be audited annually by Cont6le general des finances
(CGF).
With regard to the PEFG component, the IBRD loan proceeds, equivalent to an authorized amount of
US$2 million (four months of expected guarantee coverage), would be disbursed into a special account in
the Central Bank. These proceeds would be transferred into an escrow account against the issuance of
guarantee certificates by COTUNACE. The special account would be replenished (up to the US$5
million allocated for the PEFG Fund) upon issuance by COTUNACE of guarantee certificate equivalent
to the initial balance of the special account. The funds available in the escrow account could be placed by
COTUNACE into nonspeculative liquid, interest-bearing financial instruments, which would not involve
risks of depreciation or loss of value, in line with the existing practices of COTUNACE. These
investmnents would meet guidelines agreed with the Bank.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
Except in the case of the PEFG component, all disbursement requests would be on the basis of certified
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) except for payments under contracts above US$100,000 equivalent
for consultant firms and US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultants. All disbursement requests
corresponding to contracts above these amounts shall be fully documented (i.e., copies of invoices or
other documents that substantiate payment to the consultant). Reimbursement requests should be made to
the Bank on a monthly basis, along with appropriate supporting documentation, for both foreign and local
expenditures. The documentation for SOEs would be retained for review by the Bank's supervision
missions and project auditors.
The procedures for use of grant funds would be as follows: After approving an export plan presented by
the firm, the EMAF Director Committee (EDC) would sign an agreement with the firm specifying the
details of the implementation of the export plan. Disbursements will occur in conformation with the
operational manual (see also Annex 6).
C.5.4. Financial management
The financial management systems related to the project are detailed in Annex 6 and are recapitulated
below. In general, the project's execution agencies have satisfactory financial management systems,
including, in the case of COTIJNACE and CEPEX, adequate internal control mechanisms and double
entry bookkeeping systems, conforming to the regulations in force in this field and to generally accepted
accounting policies. Independent auditors perform annual audit of financial statements, following
generally accepted auditing standards. The Department of Financial Affairs within Tunisian customs
maintains accounting books on a cash basis according to the provisions of the Public Accounting Law.
However, an adequate budget and expenses follow-up system is in place and allows close management of
activities. Two areas of improvement have been identified: (a) the need to set up an efficient information
management system at the level of each implementing agency so that it can manage its own activity
without a direct impact on project monitoring (see Annex 6); and (b) the need to reinforce the financial
management capacity for project monitoring and reporting.
Project monitoring and reporting. The PCMU would be responsible for aclministrative and financial
organization of the project, including the appointment within the PCMU of Jnigh-level staff with skills,
qualifications, and experience in accounting, financial management, and. computers. A Financial
Management Manual (FMM) formalizing procedures, attributions, and job descriptions of the project
team (assigned to the PCMI or working on its behalf), would be developed. The FMM would include:
(a) the functional organization chart of the project and job descriptions of the project team; (b) a detailed
chart of accounts for the project as well as its accounting policies and procedures; (c) internal control
mechanisms and procedures; (d) the formnat and content of the Project Management Report (PMR): and
(e) audit arrangements. The FMM would be submitted for approval of the Steering Committee before its
implementation. A specific training program for the project team would be developed and submitted for
the Bank's approval. Needed resources would be mobilized for efficient implementation of this training
program.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
The borrower has agreed to implement an action plan (in the project files) leading to the adoption of the
project management reports (PMR) required under the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI)
procedures 26 months after the expected effectiveness date. This period is longer than the 18-month
guideline included in the LACI implementation manual. During the transition period, the reports will
conform to an agreed format that complies fully with the Bank's current guidelines.
D: Project Rationale
D.1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Project scope: Two project alternatives were considered to address the export development objectives of
the Government: a global project involving short and long-term measures, and a more focused project to
address immediate concerns while preparing the ground for longer-term measures in a follow-up
operation. Given the need to respond quickly to emerging global challenges presented by the FTA
agreement with the EU and emerging competitors, a longer-term integrated export development project
was not considered. It would have taken considerably longer to prepare due to logistical constraints and
requirements to enhance the international competitiveness of Tunisian enterprises. It was therefore
decided to focus on three actions which, if implemented simultaneously, would lead to an increase in the
number of new exporters and markets in a relatively short period of time.
Several options were also considered for the design of the selected project alternatives. Regarding the
market access component, a traditional approach emphasizing strong inhouse and highly centralized
service provision was rejected in favor of the option of an internationally experienced management team
to help ensure effective performance and transparent and impartial approval and management of funds.
Similarly, several models were reviewed for the operation of the PEFG. Ultimately, a publicly owned
export credit insurance agency was found to be the most appropriate for Tunisia on the grounds that:
(a) COTUNACE already has substantial experience in export credit insurance and guarantees; and
(b) Tunis RE, which serves as a small business finance guarantee (SBFG) agency, would require
substantial strengthening to manage a PEFG scheme.
Regarding trade facilitation, the option of acquiring existing computer applications for trade document
processing and customs clearance was considered. However this would involve extensive customization,
which would not be practical, and would involve high risk. Instead, the proposed approach would build
on local expertise already acquired and integrate ongoing initiatives.

D.3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
*  The project's basic rationale is derived from cross-country experience showing that simultaneous
actions to facilitate market access to SME and potential exporters, reduce barriers to access to
working capital (preshipment) finance by SME and new exporters, and reduce and facilitate steps and
procedures involved in trade transactions, are key to success in export development.
*  International experience has suggested that the effects of export development policies can be masked
by the large one-time costs required to enter export markets - costs involved in finding information
on export markets, upgrading product design and quality, adapting packaging and labeling to export
markets, and establishing marketing channels. On the other hand, it has also been found that once
these market entry costs are met, such investments encourage a sustainable commitment to export
markets by exporters as long as operating costs are covered.2 The proposed project, by addressing
these market entry costs, would contribute to sustainable export development.
*  Experience in many developing countries, including those in Latin America, shows that traditional
export promotion rarely has been effective in expanding exports. These kinds of services have been
supply rather than demand driven; and external assistance has rarely focused on enterprises
themselves. Countries that have facilitated the finance of export-related services provided byprivate
sector firms have been much more successful in promoting exports. The market access approach
supported by the project is commonly found in both industrialized and emerging economies. The
project files contain reference to 8 such programs in OECD and East Asian countries, as well as
20 countries in which such programs have been financed by World Bank loans. Public-private
partnership is a preferred approach (as opposed to a purely public and centralized mechanism) insofar
as resource allocation and service contracting are made at the market level on a demand-driven basis
without targeting, and result in high impact and modest administrative costs. This approach is also
superior to financial subsidies, since it is transparent and does not distort financial markets. It also
has well-defined exit policies; the market access assistance is a temporary, one-time effort to reduce
market failures and support individual firms' specific export plans (which usually run 6-12 months).
The self-selecting and maximum 50 percent financing of total costs strongly encourage firms'
commitment to good implementation. Furthermore, the project recognizes that the public sector has a
role to play in the development of a local market for market access services, rather than providing
these services itself.
*  In general, exporters finance their export activity through self-financing, bank loans and credits, or
supplier credit. Much of the export activities of Tunisian firms has been financed through supplier
credit through subcontracting arrangements. But the letter of credit-based export structures are more
profitable for exporters than subcontracting-based export activities. In addition, it is difficult for
SME and new exporters to self-finance export production and to access bank credit and/or loans, due
in part to collateral requirements by the banks (high perceived risks of SME exporters). The project,
by strengthening export finance guarantee mechanisms, facilitates bank financing of export activities.
Many emerging economies have offered preshipment export finance guarantee (PEFG) schemes
because they are convinced that without the active involvement of a massive number of SMEs, it
would be difficult to globalize their economies. Furthermore, globalization efforts could not be
delayed until their banking sector is willing to take SME's export manufacturing nonperfornance
risks without PEFG schemes. PEFG schemes are even common in developed economies. For
example, the United States EXIM bank provides such guarantees to SME exporters. However, like
any other development policy instrument, the success or failure of PEFG schemes depends on
management efficiency. In several emerging economies, including Korea and Taiwan, PEFG
schemes have played a pivotal role in exploiting export potential: about half of the export value added
has been generated by SME exporters in successful economies. The lessons from these economies
will be used in the design of the PEFG scheme under the project. The early lessons from some other
economies, including Zimbabwe and South Africa, in which the Bank has recently helped put in place
PEFG schemes, have also been used in the design of this component of the project.

D.4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The establishment of the Superior Export Council and the objectives of the Ninth Plan are clear
indications of GoT's commitment to export development. During project preparation, public and private
sector stakeholders participated extensively in the project's design, through working groups and firm-
level surveys of exporters and nonexporters to determine key constraints to export development and
potential demand for the each component of the project.  Commitment is also reflected in the
accomplishments to date, which include the drafting of a new law for PEFG and substantial progress in
defining operational manuals, management plans, and initial institutional infiastructures for PEFG and
EMAF.
D.5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The proposed project builds on earlier dialogue with the Tunisian authorities and the private sectors and
on work in the areas of trade and industrial development. In addition, the Bank would bring a multi-
dimensional cross-country perspective and experience with the design and implementation of matching
grant schemes, export finance guarantees, and trade facilitation. The GoT has been very selective in
accessing IBRD financial assistance and has determined that export development is a high priority where
Bank assistance would be beneficial.
E: Summary Project Analysis
E.1. Economic andfinancial analyses (supported by Annex 4):
This is a catalytic project that promotes the capacity to export, builds supportive institutions, and reduces
transaction costs to export businesses, which is vital to advancing a small, open economy such as Tunisia.
The project is linked closely to Tunisia's strong commitment to export development (Section D.4) and the
corresponding elements of the Bank's CAS (Section B. 1). In addition, the significance and the demand
for the specific financial and technical services proposed under the project were corroborated in a focused
field survey (Section B.2). As the project supports the acceleration of aprocess that leads to increased
exports and economic growth, formal quantitative cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis would not
capture many of the project's economic benefits. Also, the project's support of market access would
essentially be in the form of technical assistance for which it is difficult to establish the causality effect.
However, experience has shown that the improved entrepreneurship that results from programs such as
EMAF, has led to quantifiable benefits in the form of additional exports. In addition, the export market
access and preshipment export finance components have a strong public good jlastification insofar as they
aim to help redress market imperfections (for example, imperfect information on SME risks and on
potential buyers and export market requirements), which constrain a robust investment and export
response to trade liberalization. This support provides a stimulus to firms (to lower the very high initial
information cost required to penetrate export markets) and to banks (by eliminating costly information
requirements on SME and first-time exporters) that, as Bank research has shown, often does not result
from policy change alone. Another important economic advantage of this support is that it helps
accelerate the growth, employment, and skills externalities which normally spill over from international
trade and investment. A partial estimate of the economic and financial benefits is presented in Annex 4.
This partial estimate is based on the expected increase in output and exports by participating firms. As an
illustration, the net present value (NPV) of the project's net economic benefits over five years are
estimated at US$407 million. In addition, the present value of additional exports generated through the
EMAF and PEFG components (US$760 million over five years) represents 2.5 percent of the present
value of the stream of projected merchandise exports over the same five years). Annex 4 provides more
information on economic and financial analyses.
The simplification of trade and customs procedures, training of customs officials to implement the
simplified procedures, and enhancing the electronic commerce capacities are expected to reduce
transaction costs of Tunisian exports and thereby improve competitiveness of Tunisian firms. Reduction

of import clearance time from the average of 8 days to 2 or 3 days, is expected to reduce the costs
involved in trade document processing, representing a saving of between 1 to 2.5 percent of merchandise
trade.3    Assuming  the  schedule  proposed  in  Annex  4  to  realize  these  savings  gradually  over
time (1 percent of merchandise trade by the sixth year after project effectiveness), the (partial) NPV of the
economic benefits of the trade facilitation component would be about US$47 million over the 5-year life
of the project.

Fiscal impact. Incremental exports generated through project components would result in additional tax
revenues from: (a) payroll taxes paid by exporting firms and employees; (b) value-added taxes generated
by incremental consumption by (new) employees; and (c) corporate income taxes. In the case of the
3 I   Such an achievement would reduce the average value of goods at the port and STAM by five to six days, equivalent to a saving of around
2 percent of annual merchandise imports. For traders operating on a 30-day replenishment cycle, this would represent a reduction of 15
percent of investment in inventory; for shorter cycle times, even more. This could translate into a 2 percent reduction in consumer prices
for imported merchandise for 30-day cycle imports. The reduction in average duration of container stay will allow STAM to operate
within its available storage capacity, as opposed to a 30 percent overcapacity at the moment. The reduction in overall cycle time will also
enable Tunisian exporters to export smaller batches more frequently and at more competitive prices. This is a key requirement for Tunisian
exporters to operate on the basis of just-in-time delivery, thereby fully exploiting the competitive edge that is provided by their natural
geographical proximity to Europe, their major export market.

EMAF, based on the assumptions outlined in Annex 4, it is estimated that the additional fiscal benefits
would more than pay for the Fund. Tax recovery would be US$40 million from export firms and
US$3 million from export firm employees. This would represent 3.9 times the grant amount per
enterprise. Therefore, even with conservative assumptions, it is likely that Government would recover
more than the cost of the grant (and Bank interest) through the program over a rolling three-year period.
Higher benefits would be generated taking into account the benefit stream over more than three years (see
details in the project files). Similarly for the PEFG scheme, tax recovery would be US$128 million from
exporters and US$11 million from the employees. The counterpart funds (e.g., for investments) and
recurrent costs required by the project, would not present a heavy burden on Government's budget.
Following the termination of the EMAF in three years, it is expected that the beneficiaries (and other
enterprises) use the export services supported under the EMAF at their full miarket cost. The PEFG is
expected to encourage the banking sector to finance preshipment export finance needs of SME and
emerging exporters, through a reduction of the perceived nonperformance risks. Finally, the savings
realized by the reductions in recurrent costs of processing trade documents (currently manual in large
part) are likely to more than compensate for the recurrent costs required to operate the electronic
commerce system under the project.
E.2. Social assessment:
Project preparation has included extensive consultation with public and private stakeholders and has
generated ample support from them. The project's social impact is likely to be positive, due to the
increased business generated through successful implementation of project components. Employment
should expand, particularly in the SME sector. Women employment is also likely to expand especially in
sectors such as light manufacturing and garments. No land acquisition is foreseen in any of the project
components. None of the public capacity building activities will have direct social effects.
E.3. Environmental assessment:    Environmental Category       [ ] A   [ ] B    [X] C
The project is not expected to have adverse environmental impacts. The civil works financed under the
project would be conducted in line with the Government's environmental standards and regulations,
which are acceptable to the Bank. In addition, the environment component of an ongoing Bank project
(Private Industry Support Upgrading) is expected to ensure that Tunisian exports meet ISO-14000
environmental standards. The progress under this component is satisfactory. The capacity of the existing
and new technical centers developed under that project is expected to be effectively utilized by the
beneficiaries of the Export Development Project to ensure that products comply with environmental
product standards in export markets.
E.4. Participatory approach:
Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups. The project has been designed with the leadership and
involvement of both public and private sector stakeholders at each stage. Participation has been
structured as project preparation working groups, as well as firm-level surveys of exporters and potential
exporters (details available in project files). Each project component has been designed with close
participation of a working group, consisting of key public and private sector stakeholders. Some of the
members of these working groups are also directly involved in project execution. In addition, EMAF and
PEFG components have been designed based on the views of, and the issues raised by, the Tunisian
enterprises, commercial banks, and other stakeholders.
E.5. Technical assessment:
The project design places considerable responsibility for the technical quality of the advisory, capacity
building, grant appraisal, and other assistance to the EMA]F management team. The executing agency for
the EMAF, namely CEPEX, has carefully prepared draft terms of reference and will make vigorous
efforts to invite qualified international and local experts to bid for the assignment as technical team of the
EMAF in charge of, and accountable for, day-to-day executing of the matching grant facility.

The executing agency for the PEFG, namely COTUNACE, already has substantial capacity in providing
export insurance and post-shipment guarantees. Its capacity to successfully manage the PEFG scheme
will also be strengthened under the project.
Concerning electronic commerce and customs training under the Trade Facilitation Component, the Trade
Facilitation Technical Committee will review the specifications of and alternatives for the new EDI
system, as well as the curriculum and structure of the training center.
F: Sustainability and Risks
F.]. Sustainability:
The measures supported under the proposed project would be market based and nondiscretionary.
Improving the effectiveness of the institutions and developing instruments associated with an efficient
long-term export development strategy would also promote project sustainability. The PEFG fund is a
catalytic instrument to encourage the financial sector to finance the preshipment working capital needs of
Tunisian exporters.

Annex 2
TUNISIA Export Development Project
Pr.oject Description
The project aims to address two types of market failures. The first is related to the fact that, as a result of
many years of inward orientation, many Tunisian enterprises, especially SMEs, seriously undervalue the
use of marketing and support services to help find market niches for their products and services, and to
establish contacts with export outlets and with sources of imported inputs that can improve their
competitiveness. Most enterprises perceive these services as expensive and of little impact in terms of
generating exports. However, these services are likely to be critical in inducing firms to enter export
markets. International experience has shown that in countries emerging from long periods of protectionism,
it is difficult for previously protected firms to successfully adapt to the needs of the international market. In
such an environment, it is not surprising that many small and medium-sized firms are reluctant to take the
first decisions to enter new export markets.
The second market failure is concerned with informational asymmetries on the part of Tunisian banks
about SMEs' ability to execute export orders to buyers' standards of quality, cost, and delivery. When an
enterprise receives an export order from overseas, it needs to have access to preshipment financing to
fulfill the export order (this applies equally to direct as well as indirect exporters who sell to offshore
enterprises or to trading companies). However, the process whereby financial institutions provide
working capital based on export orders (even backed by letters of credit), as opposed to overdraft
facilities based on underlying collateral, has been largely limited to large firms that can also draw on
existing assets for collateral. Financial institutions have, therefore, not invested in the systems and
training necessary to adequately review and appraise nonperformance risks. Instead, they focused on
collateralized lines of credit, which firms use at their discretion. Preshipment export financing, in
contrast, is directed at a specific transaction and not subject to borrower discretion. As a consequence of
these limitations in the capacity of financial institutions, many first-time SME exporters and existing
subcontractors have difficulty accessing preshipment export finance to fulfill their creditworthy export
projects.
The project also addresses inefficiencies in trade-related procedures and logistics that increase transaction
costs for exporters and put them at a disadvantage vis-A-vis competitors. Tunisian domestic production
and exports depend to a large extent on imported inputs. For example, imported inputs account for
60 percent of garmnent production in the offshore sector. The demand for inputs with variety, quality, and
technological content wider than those supplied locally is expected to accelerate with the AA with the EU
and with increased pressure for Tunisian firms to become competitive. The evidence from countries that
have achieved high export growth illustrates that the commodity composition of exports becomes
increasingly dependent on fast, just-in-time access to competitively priced and good-quality inputs. High
levels of exports of these successful economies have been leveraged by trade facilitation. The degree of
trade facilitation needed for strong export performance depends not only on the trade regime, but also on
formalities in port logistics, customs clearance, and quality and safety controls, all of which affect
transaction costs. While the trade regime in Tunisia has become increasingly liberalized, progress on
trade facilitation has been slow. The administration of customs clearance, port logistics and procedures,
and quality checks exhibit many bottlenecks that overburden resources and prove costly to both the
Government and the private sector. The average time taken to clear imported goods after they have been
unloaded from the vessel is eight 8 days - in quite a few cases, it reaches as long as 18 days. The
inefficient processes underlying this delay are very costly to Tunisian enterprises. Beyond cost, the
current processes severely impede the capability of Tunisian companies to respond to or accept short-
notice orders, negatively affecting the competitiveness of Tunisian exporters. Opportunities for relief of
these problems lie in: (a) better management of resources and automation; (b) redesign of policies,
procedures, regulations, and documentary requirements; and (c) institutional modernization.

PROJECT COMPONENT 1: EXPORT MARKET ACCESS (Total cost $25.0 million, of which IBRD
financing would be US$14.0 million).
A number of complementary and mutually enforcing strategies are envisaged under the project to bridge
the gap between local and international markets. This component would support: (a) efforts of Tunisian
enterprises, mainly SMEs and emerging exporters, to access export outlets and buyers, through the
introduction of export know-how and expertise; (b) the development of trading companies; (c) vendor
development programs; and (d) efficient functioning of a trade center (Maison de 1 'exportateur) that the
Tunisian authorities and private exporters are planning to establish. The component builds on the lessons
of international experience that the solution to market access problems is not necessarily direct
Government intervention, but rather policies and strategies to actively engage private institutions and
firms that have specialized marketing expertise.
* Export Market Access Fund (EMAF) (Total cost US$24.0 million, of which IBRD financing would
be US$13.5 million).
(draft Operational Manual is available in project files)
Objective. A matching grant scheme (Export Market Access Fund - EMAF) fbr individual firms would
be established to cover, on a temporary basis, part of the cost of technical and marketing services by local
and foreign experts required to enable enterprises, especially SMEs, to enter export markets. It aims to
provide temporary technical/marketing assistance, over a period of 3 years, to about 350 firms in order to
significantly improve their export performance, by cofinancing their export development plans using
nonrepayable grants as the cofinancing mechanism. In doing this, the EMAF would also stimulate the
use of foreign and local business and export development services by private firms. The EMAF
management team would have the responsibility (and would therefore have the relevant skills and
experience) to actively help firms (both existing and potential exporters) to prepare their export plans.
The EMAF would complement the existing mise a7 niveau program by assiisting firms to focus and
identify specific market niches and on export development plans to reach these markets; and would
extend and expand upon the Export Promotion Fund (FOP]RODEX) of CEPEX.

Country: Tunisia                                          Project Title: Export Development Project
Instruments. The main instruments of the EMAF would consist of:
* nonreimbursable matching grants (50 percent of expenditures), payable to beneficiaries of the EMAF
for eligible activities undertaken within the framework of an export plan;
*  technical assistance to clients of the programn in the preparation of their export plan; and
*  technical assistance during implementation of export plans.
Cost-sharing principle. Setting a requirement for a significant contribution by firms (50 of expenditures) to
the costs of services assisted under export support programs would reduce the likelihood of misuse of funds
or support for low-value services. It is expected that the commitment of firms to their projects would be
significantly increased by virtue of their contribution to the cost.
Activities cofinanced and maximum support. The EMAF would offer its services solely in response to
private sector demand on a nondiscriminatcry basis. The assistance would be provided once an export
plan has been developed at the firm level and the exporter (or potential exporter) has shown commitment
to implementing it. The EMAF would cofinance : (a) enterprise diagnostics in view of developing export
plans (the EMAF would cofinance 70 percent of the costs up to TD 10,000, and the enterprises the
remaining 30 percent); and (b) consultant services, acquisition of information (including software and
reference material), trips by entrepreneurs to explore specific export opportunities and buyers, mailing of
samples, promotion material, and other miscellaneous expenses required to implement the export plans
(the EMAF would cofinance 50 percent of the costs (up to TD 100,000, and the enterprise the remaining
50 percent). The EMAF would not participate in the capital of beneficiary enterprises, and would not
cofinance investments, equipment purchase, or operational costs of the beneficiary enterprises.
Size of the EMAF. Based on a survey of enterprises conducted during project preparation, at least 350
small and medium firms producing tradable goods across the country, as well as international trading
companies, are expected to benefit from an EMAF endowed with US$10 million from the proceeds of the
proposed Bank loan, over a period of 3 years. The EMAF would mobilize an equivalent amount from the
private sector, matched by internal resources of participating firms. I
Temporary support and exit policy. The funds are to be committed within three years. A one year
extension may be agreed upon at midterm review, depending on the results and performance of the
scheme. The scheme involves temporary support to reduce market failures, such as insufficient
information on markets and its requirements, and would provide assistance to an enterprise only up to a
ceiling. Experience has shown that once firms are introduced to the benefits of the activities that the Fund
would support, they use these services at their market prices.
WTO compatability. The EMAF is comparable with similar funds of many national, provincial, and state
governments that facilitate the provision of information about overseas markets to firms within their
jurisdictions. It is also consistent with the new framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The
grants are nonactionable subsidies as defined in Article 8 of the Agreement on Subsidies and
Countervailing Measures. They are nonactionable because they are not specific, as provided in Article 8,
paragraph 1 (a): specificity under the WTO rules typically involves a targeting of geographic regions or
economic sectors, and such targeting is expressly disallowed under the Operating Manual for the EMAF.
Second, even if a charge of specificity could be made, the activities to be financed by the Fund would fall
under the exceptions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 8, principally the exception for research
activities carried out on a contract basis for industrial research and for precompetitive development
activity. In appropriate cases, the exception for adaptation of existing facilities to new enviromnental
requirements could also be applicable. In accordance with Article 8.3, WTO would be notified of the
program. The Manual also provides for a quarterly review of performance of the Fund by CEPEX and
the Bank to ensure that the rules are strictly adhered to in practice.
Ninety percent of the 203 enterprises surveyed by the Tunisian counterparts during project preparation, showed keen
interest in the EMAF, and 93 percent stated that they would pay 50 percent of the cost of implementation of the export plan
cofinanced by the EMAF.

Firm eligibility. Matching cofinancing support would be provided to individual Tunisian private firns in
manufacturing and tradable services having qualifying export plans. In addition, the following are also
eligible: (a) indirect exporters and offshore exporters developing onshore partnerships; and (b)
international trading companies. Exporters who use trading companies would be considered direct
exporters, and therefore eligible for the scheme.
Eligible export plans. An export plan is the basis for all EMAF assistance and should be prepared by the
firm. Such plans include a set of activities focused on developing: (a) new export products; (b) new
export markets; and/or (c) new exporting firms. The basis for the export plan is a written statement,
which demonstrates that the firm has given serious consideration to the plaining issues involved. An
export plan might typically take a firm through three stages:
*  investigation of the target market, usually starting with desk research or preliminary phone research,
followed by more intensive field interviewing, carried out either by the firm's staff or by an outside
service supplier, and market exploration visits by firm personnel;
*  product/service adaptation on the basis of information collected from the imarket, in order to respond
to customer preferences; for instance, through changes in product design, rationalizing production to
reduce costs, or through improved quality assurance; and
*  with the adaptation completed, active selling of the improved product/services.
Management of the EMAF. The EMAF would be executed under the overall supervision of an EMAF
Director Committee (EDC), and would be executed according to a Manual of Operating Policies and
Procedures (Operating Manual) and by an EMAF management team (EMT) consisting of internationally
experienced experts in matching grant management. Ihe team would be financed by the Bank loan
within the allocation for the component.
-  EMAF Steering Committee.  The EDC, headed by the PDG of C'EPEX and composed of
representatives from the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Finance, COTUNACE, and UTICA
(FEDEX), would : (a) define the broad orientation and strategies of the scheme; (b) ensure proper
execution of the scheme according to the Operating Manual; (c) approve cofinancing requests
submitted by the EMT, as well as the annual work programs of the EMT; and (d) submit annual
activity and financial status reports to CEPEX Board of Directors, the GoT, and the Bank.
*  EMAF management team. The responsibility for management and execution of the EMAF would lie
with the EMT within the framework of annual plans approved by the EDC. The EMT would be
composed of: (a) a Director/Coordinator with experience in international trade management; and (b)
and a group of experts, composed of one or two international consultants with substantial experience
in export development, export market requirements, and management o:f matching grants aimed at
promoting exports and competitiveness, as well as two Tunisian consultants with substantial
knowledge of private enterprise development, export market requirements, and industrial subsectors.
The Director/Coordinator would be appointed by the President of CEPEX and would not be involved
in day-to-day operation of the EMAF. He/she would instead ensure that the experts function
according to the Operational Manual and that their work is facilitated. The experts would be selected
on the basis of international competitive bidding, and would be responsible for the promotion and
marketing of the EMAF; establishing close working relationships with beneficiary enterprises;
helping these enterprises, if necessary, to develop their export plans; evaluating the projects to be
financed by the EMAF; and presenting these projects to the Director/Coordinator to pass to EDC for
approval.
Plan preparation. The quality of the export plan - quality management - would be ensured by providing
inputs up front, rather than quality control through technical evaluation of export plans. Two options
would be available to firms. First, firms would have the right to submit plans prepared independently.



Project Appraisal Document                                                      Page 29
Country: Tunisia                                      Project Title: Export Development Project
However, to ensure that the proposed initiatives are presented in good faith, and are broadly consistent
with the market positioning of the firm, no plan would be supported without a visit to the firm by a
member of the EMAF management team; or second, firm-level plans would be prepared by the firm with
the active support of the EMAF management team (US$1.5 million under the project would be allocated
to finance this preplan assistance).
Letter of agreement. On receiving approval for grant support, each recipient would be required to sign a
letter of agreement binding the recipient to present defined deliverables for evaluation by the management
team. The EMT has the right to view verifiable outputs, but not to take them off a client firm's premises,
or take copies or photographs. All outputs from supported activities would remain the exclusive property
of the beneficiary enterprise, with commercial confidentiality fully preserved.
Monitoring and Performance Assessment
*  Monitoring of project support impact. The beneficiary enterprise would be obliged to supply the EMT
with data permitting an assessment of the project's impact on export growth. Bank supervision
missions would have the same rights to view outputs and records, on a sampling basis, for supervision
purposes. Actual assessment would be made by qualified independent consultants contracted by the
Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit. This information would be reported to CEPEX, the GoT,
and to the Bank annually. Within two years after the final disbursement from EMAF, CEPEX would
supply to the Bank a study assessing the overall impact of the Fund, as well as specific successes and
failures and lessons learned.
X  Indicators. Scheme and management team performance during the three-year period would be
evaluated based on meeting the targets specified in an annual work plans approved in advance by the
EDC. Scheme impat would be evaluated primarily with respect to the performance indicators found
in Annex I of PAD.
*  Management team performance. As part of formal agreement with EDC, the management team
would be committed to developing an annual work plan for each 12-month period of operation. The
plan would specify in detail the activities to be carried out to launch and promote the scheme, and to
manage it under the terms of the Operating Manual. The work plan would specify the man-day inputs
for each activity, and the individual responsibilities within the management team. Progress made in
achieving this plan, plus modifications proposed to the plan, would be reported to the EDC for each
operational quarter. Modifications to annual plans would then to be agreed with the EDC. Twice-
yearly progress reports would be submitted to the Bank.
*  Final impact study. A sample survey of recipient firms would be used to evaluate the scheme's
impact. This would be carried out one year after the final grant disbursement, and would be
completed two months after the closing date of the component. This timing would enable the results
to be incorporated into the Implementation Completion Report for the project. The survey would be
contracted out by the PCU to an independent specialist. The survey would include comprehensive site
visits to a minimum of 5 percent of recipients, and would seek not only to evaluate direct incremental
impact on sales revenue, but also to gather information on indirect impact, such as on customer
orientation, quality assurance, continuing product development, employee motivation, and company
image. It would also specifically seek to evaluate the willingness of firms to continue using specialist
services after scheme support, at full market prices.
* Interim impact survey. At least one month before the midterm review, the EMT would furnish to the
EDC and the Bank a detailed report on the scheme's progress. The PCM[J would therefore
commission a smaller representative survey, to achieve an interim evaluation of the impact.

* Support for regulatory, procedural, and institutional reforms to encoulrage the development of
international trading companies (Project cost US$500, 000, of which US$300,000 would be
financed by IBRD). Following on past collaborative initiatives to develop trading companies, CEPEX
and FEDEX would implement a two-year Trading Company Development Program with a total
estimated cost, net of contributions by participating firms, of US$500,000. The programn would
consist of three main components:
1) A diagnostic study of the current situation and activities of international trading companies in
Tunisia, and elaboration of a strategy for their establishment in foreign countries, including a
proposal for better redeployment into international markets and increased contribution to
Tunisian exports.
2) An international trading company forum to be held in Tunisia several times a year. The main
participants to the forum would be Tunisian trading companies and local producers. Presentations
would be made by experienced international trading companies. Tlhe forum would focus on
specific competencies of the trading companies such as market development, product
development, financing, and production management.
3) An international trading company overseas exchange program. This program would cover a series
of visits by Tunisian trading companies and producers to foreign countries. The objective of the
program would be to enable Tunisian trading companies to learn international best practice and
develop business contacts.
*  Support for a vendor development program (Project cost US$300,000 of which US$150,000
would be financed by IBRD). This subcomponent would provide assistance to actively court vendor
development managers, professional buyers and buying chains, and design companies. With the
assistance of international expertise, the program would cover the following activities:
1) Identification of products and enterprises, for example in the garment, agricultural, and electronic
and mechanical equipment industries, that can immediately benefit from the vendor development
program; and preparation of profiles of these product and enterprises.
2) Preparation of a database for subcontracting/procurement agencies, such as Marks and Spencer,
Ikea, US buyers associations, etc., which have a potential interest in these profiles; and
conducting of surveys to evaluate their interest in learning more about Tunisian producers.
3) Conducting a series of visits to the representatives of these programs and disseminating relevant
infornation on requirements for product design, cost, quality, and delivery, to ensure
participation of Tunisian producers in these programs.
*  Assistance to put in place a trade center in line with international best practice (Project cost
US$200. 000 of which US$50. 000 would be financed by IBRD). Tunisian authorities and FEDEX are
planning to put in place a new center, the Maison de 1'exportateur, through which Tunisian and
overseas businesses can conduct international business. The center is conceived to house commercial
information facilities, advisory services, conferences, one-stop representation of trade support
services, CEPEX, and international traders. Under the project, the Government, through CEPEX,
would undertake a further design and viability study as part of the ongoing design process forMaison
de 1'exportateur, which would focus on the following main areas: (a) an assessment of cross-country
experience in such centers elsewhere, in termns of costs, estimated benefits, and impact on
international trade; (b) a refined definition of desired and expected impacts of such a center, in terms
of incremental exports, new export participants, and diversification of markets and products; (c)
definition of detailed capital and operating costs of such a center, and possible variations in such costs
according to different service approaches; and (d) governance and management.

* PROJECT COMPONENT 2: PRESHIPMENT EXPORT FINANCE GUARANTEE (PEFG) (Project cost
US$6. 0 million, of which IBRD wouldfinance US$5.4 million).
(draft Operational Manual is available in project files.)
Objective. The objective of this component is to encourage financial institutions to provide preshipment
financing (working capital) to SME and emerging exporters with viable export contracts and good
prospects of success, whose perceived nonperformance risk is greater than their actual risk because the
borrowers are unable to provide adequate collateral or do not have a suitable credit history to prove they
are creditworthy. This would be accomplished by covering a large portion of this risk through the
preshipment export finance guarantee (PEFG) scheme. The facility would thus act as a catalyst for
developing sustainable preshipment financing of SME exporters by financial institutions. The scheme's
design is intended to be simple so that participation does not add materially to a financial institution's
transaction costs, create uncertainty through the reimbursement mechanism, or create too large a burden
on SME exporters through the guarantee fee charged. Some of the key reasons for the reluctance of
financial institutions to lend to SME and emerging exporters are presented in Table 2.1.

mechanism
Component summary. This component would finance a PEFG facility established by GoT to guarantee
preshipment export loans by participating financial intermediaries to SME and emerging exporters. Such
a guarantee facility would be operated and administered by the PEFG agency (COTUNACE). Facility
oversight and monitoring would be the responsibility of the Risk Agreement Committee (RAC), headed
by the Chief Executive Officer of COTUNACE. The facility would guarantee 90 percent of the
nonperformance risk of SME exporters that the financial institutions must bear. A premium of
0.15 percent per month would be charged for such guarantee coverage and would be paid by exporters.
Coverage would be offered for a period up to 180 days. Covered bank loans could finance only up to 90
percent of the value of export proceeds. These loans would cover the input and working capital costs of
producers exporting their final products, or of indirect exporters supplying to offshore companies. The
facility is designed with a streamlined set of approval mechanisms.

PEFG fund. The PEFG fund would be created in accordance with a Law anid/or Decree for Guarantee
Fund to be enacted before project effectiveness. The RAC would be the decisionmaking body of the
PEFG fund and scheme.
PEFG scheme. The PEFG agency would issue a PEFG certificate to a bank offering preshipment export
finance, on behalf of a SME direct or indirect exporter with an export L/C or back-to-back domestic L/C
that pays the guarantee premium. The certificate would state that the PEFG agency would make the
guarantee payment, which is 90 percent of the preshipment export loan to the bank, in the event that the
exporter fails to pay back the loan due to reasons other than the foreign buyer's nonpayment and events
normnally covered by insurance (including fire insurance and marine insurance).
PEFG agency. In accordance with the Guarantee Law and Decree, to be enacted before project
effectiveness, COTUNACE would be designated the PEFG agency under a management agreement
between the Ministry of Finance and COTUNACE.
Basic principles for preshipment export finance guarantee operation
*  Positive net social benefit principle of PEFG operation. Social benefits of PEFG operation, measured
by the social gains stemming from additional exports, GDP, and employment made possible by
access to preshipment export finance, must be higher than the social costs of the PEFG operation, as
measured by the social expenditures associated with the pre-shipment export finance defaults due to
manufacturing nonperformance by SME and emerging exporters and PEFG administration costs (see
Annex 4).
*  Premium resulting in no loss/no profit financial position of PEFG fund. Once the startup period has
been completed, the total revenues of the PEFG agency, consisting of premium, interest, and other
incomes, must be equal to the total expenditures of the PEFG agency, consisting of net guarantee
payments (i.e., gross guarantee payments less recoveries) and PEFG administrative costs, including
SME and emerging direct and indirect exporter information and marketing costs, in a multiyear
accounting framework.
o  Banks' perceived risks vs. actual risks of SME or new exporters' manufacturing nonperformance. The
PEFG is designed to cover both perceived and actual risks of exporters' manufacturing
nonperformance. The PEFG agency would be responsible for screening out from PEFG coverage,
exporters that have loan misuse risks (those who lack good faith). As a result, in the event that some
of the guaranteed export loan defaults occur due to exporters' loan misuse rather than manufacturing
nonperformance, the costs of such defaults would be borne by the PEFG agency rather than the
banks.
  Minimization of moral hazard. In order to reduce or eliminate potential imoral hazards of exporters
and banks in relation to PEFG coverage, exporters would self-finance at least 10 percent of their
preshipment export finance needs, and commercial banks would be askecl to take at least about 10
percent of the preshipment export finance default risks, if they want to have PEFG coverage.
o  First principle for access to PEFG. All SME and emerging direct and indirect exporters that cannot
have access to preshipment export finance, based on confirmed export L/Cs issued in buying
countries without political risks (or export credit insurance coverage for non L/C-based exports or
exports to politically risky countries), or back-to-back domestic L/Cs due to physical collateral and
track record demands of commercial banks, would be assured of access to the PEFG scheme as long
as they do not lack good faith and/or adequate production facilities to meet the export orders.
However, given the anticipated strong demand for PEFG (based on a survey conducted during project
preparation), as well as the relatively small initial size of the fund (US$5.0 million), and in order to



Project Appraisal Document                                                      Page 33
Country: Tunisia                                      Project Title: Export Development Project
minimize default risk in the initial phase of the scheme's operation, the PEFG agency, if it deems
appropriate, could retain those applications for PEFG coverage that present the lowest risk of
nonperformance. Following this initial phase, and after the PEFG agency and the RAC have
developed a better understanding of the nature of the demand and default rates (around the first
quarter of the year 2000), the PEFG agency could fully comply with the automatic access principle.
* Second principle for access to PEFG. The PEFG agency should be able to screen out from PEFG
coverage exporters that lack good faith and/or adequate production facilities. Enterprise visits by
skilled staff and well-developed information networks would be necessary for the screening out
process. However, the PEFG agency should not attempt to make PEFG coverage decisions based on
its evaluation of exporters' manufacturing nonperformance risks. In other words, the PEFG agency or
commercial banks should not attempt to evaluate individual exporters' manufacturing
nonperformance risks on an ex-ante basis. The main reason for this is that accurately evaluating SME
and emerging direct and indirect exporters' manufacturing nonperformance risks would require
significant capabilities and expertise, which may be too costly to develop in the PEFG agency. No
PEFG agency or bank in a developing country has demonstrated the capability to make such accurate
evaluations.
Role of technical assistance. The PEFG agency should try to reduce manufacturing nonperformance risks
of exporters who use the PEFG scheme, by collaborating with other schemes (including the EMAF
component under the current project) that aim to assist SME and emerging direct and indirect exporters to
develop production and product know-how, and facilitate access to export markets. In this context, the
PEFG agency should try to determine the underlying factors for default on an ex-post basis.
Critical importance of trust and credibility. Establishing credibility, good reputation, and trust among
SME and emerging direct and indirect exporters as well as commercial banks is critical for the success of
the PEFG operation. To achieve this objective, first the PEFG certificates must be backed by a PEFG
fund that is sufficient to cover guarantee payment claims associated with contingent liabilities. Second,
the written rules (stated in the Operational Manual) for PEFG coverage and PEFG payments must be
clear, and guarantee coverage applications and guarantee payment claims must be processed with utmost
speed, transparency, and automaticity based on the rules. Third, the PEFG agency must establish its
unique position in Tunisia's development community by playing a catalytic role in promoting
development of SME and emerging direct and indirect exporters.
Importance of PEFG scheme marketing. Without effective marketing and public education, many SME
and emerging direct and indirect exporters, as well as commercial banks, might not learn of the benefits
of and procedures to obtain PEFG coverage. Therefore, the PEFG agency must develop and implement an
effective marketing and public education strategy.
Beneficiaries and eligibility. All Tunisian SME and emerging direct and indirect exporters in all
manufacturing, processing, and service activities, except for those sectors on a negative list, which are
unable to access preshipment export finance from commercial banks, would be eligible for PEFG
coverage - provided that they submit confirmed export L/Cs, other export orders backed by export credit
insurance, back-to-back domestic L/Cs, or international subcontract fee payment guarantees that assure
the self-liquidation of the underlying preshipment finance guaranteed by the buyers' payments within the
loan and PEFG maturity. All commercial banks or other financial institutions that provide preshipment
export finance would be eligible for covering their preshipment export loans with PEFG. Short-term
working capital preshipment export finance for direct or indirect export item producers (for imported and
domestic intermediate input purchase and value-added expenses) and trading companies (for export
product purchase and inventory) would be eligible for PEFG.
Types of risks guaranteed. The PEFG protects participating financial intermediaries against a loss
resulting from the nonpayment of the preshipment export finance due to insolvency or protracted default
caused by exporters' manufacturing nonperformance and reasons other than foreign buyers or buyers'

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
countries not meeting export orders (risks covered by such insurance as fire insurance and marine
insurance would not be covered). Any preshipment export loan nonpayment risks associated with
exporters' potential loan misuse would be eliminated by screening out exporters that lack good faith from
PEFG coverage. However, if after a PEFG certificate has been issued, any failure to pay back a
preshipment export loan stemming from the PEFG agency's screening mistakes, then the PEFG agency
must make the guarantee payment without any dispute. On the other hand, any preshipment export loan
nonpayment risks caused by foreign buyers or buyers' cotntries should be covered by confirmed export
L/Cs, back-to-back domestic L/Cs, or export credit insurance policies, which must be requested as a
condition for PEFG coverage.
Types of guarantees.
*  Individual vs. revolving guarantee. Financial intermediaries and exporters can choose between the
individual guarantee, which covers a particular preshipment export loan cycle, and the revolving
guarantee, which covers repeated preshipment export loan cycles. The individual guarantee covers a
particular preshipment export loan to meet a particular export order backed by a confirmed export
L/C, back-to-back domestic L/C, or export credit insurance. Therefore, the maximum limit of the
individual guarantee would not exceed 81 percent [i.e., (90 percent loan share) times (90 percent
PEFG coverage share)] of the export L/C value, back-to-back domestic L/C value, or other export
order value backed by the 100 percent export credit insurance. The revolving guarantee covers
repeated loan cycles within a maximum one-year periiod. In this case, the maximum size of the export
value for which one cycle preshipment export loan and the PEFG coverage are considered would not
exceed 1/4 of the previous 12 months' export performance or previous 3 months' export value (for
products with longer production cycles, the maxiimum size would be adjusted). Therefore, the
maximum size of the PEFG coverage per cycle would not exceed 81 percent of the maximum value
of export in the case that all the export transactions within one year are backed by confirmed export
L/Cs, or 64.8 percent in the case of that all export transactions within one year are backed by 80
percent covered export credit insurance. The bank would need to ensure that, on a quarterly basis, the
actual export orders are identical or very close to the expected export orders based on which the
guarantees have been issued.
* Delegated guarantee. In order to streamline PEFG procedures, it may be desirable to consider
offering a delegated guarantee scheme along with the nornal guarantee scheme. Under the delegated
guarantee scheme, the RAC would delegate approval authority for small-size guarantees to the PEFG
agency.
Guarantee coverage, maturity, premium and limit. The PEFG scheme would cover 90 percent of the
value of the preshipment export loan (and associated interest) default risk stermming from the exporters'
manufacturing nonperformance. The guarantee maturity would be identical to the preshipment export
loan maturity, up to 180 days for the individual guarantee (renewable one time) and one year for the
revolving guarantee. At the initial stage, a premium rate of 0.15 percent would be charged to the exporter
on the monthly balance of the preshipment export loan outstanding coveredl by the guarantee, payable
upon issuance of the guarantee. The maximum size of the PEFG coverage for a single turnover of the
preshipment export loan would be TD 150,000 (about US$140,000).
Projected financing. The fund would initially be set at US$5.0 million, which excludes US$1.0 million
allocated for institution building and marketing (US$0.4 million of which to be financed by the Bank
loan). The total bank preshipment export loans covered during the initial 12 rnonths of the scheme would
be about twice the size of the PEFG fund.2 Following that period, the level of guarantees could increase
according to the schedule shown in Annex 4, up to a total leverage of contingent liabilities to total
guarantees of 15:1, or a total fund of US$75 million.
2!   Since the PEFG would cover 90 percent of the preshipment export loans, with a coverage ratio of 2:1 during the initial
period of 12 months, the loan coverage would be more than twice the initial size of the F'EFG fund.

Disbursement. The Bank loan under this component would finance a PEFG facility, established by the
GoT to guarantee preshipment export finance loans by participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) to
SME and emerging exporters, in order to provide working capital to these exporters for importing raw
materials and intermediate imports. Initially, the IBRD loan proceeds, equivalent to four months of
expected guarantee coverage, would be disbursed into a special account. These proceeds would then be
transferred into an escrow account against the issuance of guarantee certificates. The special account
would be replenished (up to the US$5.0 million allocated for this component) upon the issuance by the
PEFG agency of guarantee certificates equivalent to the amount initially deposited into the special
account. The funds available in the escrow account could be invested by the PEFG agency into
nonspeculative, liquid, interest-bearing financial instruments that would not involve risk of depreciation
or loss of value, in line with the existing practices of COTUNACE, the executing agency for this
component. These investments would meet guidelines agreed with IBRD.
Flow of funds. COTUNACE would deposit guarantee premiums in the escrow account mentioned above,
and would make paymnents against claims approved by RAC, directly from the escrow account.
Guarantee application and review
e Documentary requirements
- Confirmed export L/C, other export order backed by export credit insurance, back-to-back
domestic export L/C (together with original export L/C), or international subcontract fee payment
guarantee acceptable to the PEFG agency;
- Integrated application form for preshipment export loan and PEFG.
*  Guarantee application. A single integrated application form for a preshipment export loan and PEFG
should be submitted to the PEFG Agency by the bank (or exporter) after both the exporter and the
bank fill in the relevant information together with the confirmed export L/C, back-to-back domestic
L/C, or other export order backed by export credit insurance. The application form should be simple
and the required information must focus on the export transaction, primarily based on which the
export loan and the PEFG Certificate are to be granted rather than the detailed asset, liability, and net
worth information of the firm. While first-time applicants should provide all the data required in the
application form, repeated users of the PEFG should be allowed to skip the repeated data except for
the minimum required new information. The most important data for both new and repeated
applicants would be the informnation regarding L/C-based export loan cycle (such as the copy of
export L/C, back-to-back export L/C, or other export order backed by export credit insurance
endorsed by the loan handling bank, loan disbursement/liquidation plans endorsed by the bank, and
material purchase, production, and shipment plans which are consistent with the loan
disbursement/liquidation plans and the factory capacity and work force).
*  Application procedure. The exporter can submit PEFG application through its commercial bank or,
as an exception, directly to the PEFG agency.
*  Application review. The process of reviewing the application for PEFG starts with the commercial
bank. Banks should be encouraged to follow the PEFG application review guidelines (summarized
below) to be issued by the PEFG agency as part of the PEFG Operational Manual. The review of the
PEFG application should focus on:
- the self-liquidating nature of the confirmed export L/C, back-to-back export L/C, or export order
(backed by export credit insurance)-based preshipment export loan;
- nonexistence of any potential risks stemming from the foreign buyer or buying country;



Project Appraisal Document                                                       Page 36
Country: Tunisia                                      Project Title: Export Development Project
-  the bank's practice of prudent pre-shipment export loan disbursement/liquidation (i.e., linking
pre-shipment export loan disbursement to: (a) the input material import and domestic input
purchase-related import L/C and back-to-back dornestic L/C negotiations; (b) the domestic output
purchase-related back-to-back L/C negotiation; and (c) value-added generation). (In order to
ensure this practice, each applicant to the PEFG must be asked to rely on the same bank for
receiving and negotiating the export L/C and opening and negotiating the back-to-back import
and domestic L/Cs);
-  the factory facility and work force needed to produce export items on time (to be verified by
visiting the factory, spending not more than 1 to 2 hours);
-  the good faith of the exporter in producing the export product to rneet the quality and time
requirements and in paying back the preshipment export loan (to be verified by the nonexistence
of criminal or repeated default records based on the PEFG agency'.s information network on
actual and potential SME and emerging direct and indirect exporters).
The bank would focus on the first three items, while the PEFG agency would review all five items.
The application reviewed by the bank must be passed on to the PEFG agency with the bank's
comments for the final review and final decision by the PEFG agency. The 10-day target for the
normal PEFG decision includes the bank's review, the PEFG agency's review, and the PEFG's
decision on the PEFG Certificate.
Certificate of Guarantee. Once a PEFG application has been approved, then th[e PEFG Certificate would
be issued immediately by the PEFG agency to the commercial bank. The Certificate of Guarantee should
be explicitly clear about the guaranteed amount and conditions under which thie guarantee payments will
be made. The Certificate of Guarantee should state clearly that the PEFG agency will make the guarantee
payment, which is 90 percent of the uncollected guaranteed preshipment export loan balance and the
uncollected associated interest payment to the bank, based on the PEFG agency's approval of the bank's
guarantee payment claim application. The Certificate should also clearly spell out the conditions under
which the bank's guarantee payment claims would be rejected (see below). The Certificate should make it
clear that the guarantee covers the preshipment export loan default caused by the exporter's
manufacturing nonperformance and reasons other than the foreign buyer or buying country and the bank's
failure to deduct the export loan automatically from the export earnings. The Certificate of Guarantee
would spell out the bank's guaranteed preshipment export loan reporting requirements, the bank's effort to
collect unpaid loan and interest payment, and guarantee payment claim procedures, as well as the PEFG
agency's obligation to honor the Certificate of Guarantee. The banks' reporting r equirements would be:
* the guaranteed preshipment export loan effective date;
* the guaranteed loan liquidation date; and
* the guaranteed loan default date.
PEFG payment claims procedure
*  Reporting of loan default. The bank must report the guaranteed preshipment export loan default
within one month of the occurrence of the default to the PEFG agency.
*  Waiting periods for claim. The bank should be eligible to submit the guarantee payment claim after 2
months have passed since the loan default occurred, in accordance with the Certificate of Guarantee.
During this waiting period, the bank must attempt to collect the unpaid loan balance and determine
whether the defaulted exporter can restore the normal status as a guaranteed borrower by paying back
the unpaid preshipment export loan and interest.
*  Guarantee payment claims application. The bank must submit the guarantee payment claims within 6
months after the preshipment export loan default has occurred. When the bank makes the guarantee
payment claim, it must submit:

Country: Tunisia                                      Project Title: Export Development Project
- a claim application form;
- a copy of the Certificate of Guarantee;
- a copy of the integrated preshipment export loan and PEFG application form together with the
bank's and PEFG agency's evaluations;
- a copy of the export L/C, back-to-back domestic L/C, or export order backed by export credit
insurance based on which the preshipment export loan and PEFG were granted.
*  Eligible amount of claim. The PEFG payment claim amount should be 100 percent of the uncollected
balance of the guaranteed preshipment export loan, up to 90 percent of total loan amount.
*  Claims payment. The PEFG agency must accept or reject the guarantee payment claims within one
month after it has received claim application. If the guarantee payment claim is accepted in
accordance with the provisions in the Certificate of Guarantee and the Letter of Agreement Between
the PEFG Agency and the Bank, then the guarantee payment must be made immediately, without any
delay or dispute. However, the guarantee payment claim should be partly or fully rejected under the
following conditions spelled out in the Certificate of Guarantee and the Framework Agreement. The
guarantee payment claim would be rejected, if:
- The preshipment export loan was disbursed before the Certificate of Guarantee was issued;
- The preshipment export loan was disbursed after the effective date of the Certificate of Guarantee
has expired;
- The preshipment export loan default was caused by the bank's failure to deduct the export loan
automatically from the export proceeds;
- The bank failed to report the loan default within one month of the loan default or failed to file the
guarantee claim within six months of the loan default;
- The loan default was caused by the buyer's noncompliance with the provisions in the export L/C
or other export order or buying country's political risk.
Internal organizational structure of PEFG agency. In order to carry out PEFG tasks, the PEFG agency
will maintain the professional staff in the following four existing departments:
*  Guarantee Underwriting Department,
*  Indemnification Department
*  Finance Department,
*  Information and Marketing Department.
*  PROJECT COMPONENT 3: TRADE FACILITATION (Total cost US$16.3 million, of which IBRD would
finance US$12.2 million).
(Master Plan for the execution of this component available in project files.)
Currently, it can take up to 18 days for an importer to receive goods (or an exporter to receive raw
material imports) after they have been unloaded at the port. The average time is around eight days. The
objective of this component is to reduce this time to three days. Such an achievement would reduce the
average cost of goods at the port and Societe tunisienne d'acconnage et de manutention (STAM) by five
to six days. The reduction in average duration of container stay would assist STAM operate within its
available storage capacity, as opposed to a 30 percent overcapacity at the moment. The reduction in
overall cycle time would also enable Tunisian exporters to export at more competitive prices. This is a
key requirement for Tunisian exporters to operate on the basis of just-in-time delivery.



Project Appraisal Document                                                            Page 38
Country: Tunisia                                          Project Title: Export Development Project
Objective. The objective of this component is to simplify procedures associated with external trade,
thereby reducing both costs and time for clearance of goods. There are currently 19 discrete steps for
import processes and 15 steps for export (details available in project files). In pursuing this objective, the
component addresses the following six groups, or commlnities of interest, the representatives of which
have made up the Trade Facilitation Working Group for project preparation:
* Importers/exporters;
* Banks;
* Trade professionals, such as shipping agents, freight forwarders, and customs brokers;
* Cargo handling organizations responsible for unloading or loading of goods on board the vessel for
transport;
* Government departments or units and chambers of commerce that issue certificates to approve the
import and export of goods, subject to tests and occasional scrutiny;
* The national customs authority, which traditionally exercises a gatekeeper role over imports into and
exports out of the national territory, and also has a role in optimizing revenue from customs
operations and in providing a reliable source of national statistics;
* The port authority, which is responsible for establishing standards and conditions of operation within
the port area.
The concept of trade facilitation is not new in Tunisia and there are already some ongoing initiatives
toward that end, as described in the following section. The current approach, however, takes a much
broader approach to the issues while, at the same time, focusing on actions that can be quickly
implemented to bring about significant improvements in trade processes. The component would therefore
include a comprehensive set of measures targeted at the multiple public and private institutions involved
in the trade process, with special emphasis on customs procedures and port and cargo handling services.
The key means for attaining the objective are the use of electronic data interchange for document
exchange and processing, the modernization of customs procedures and the information system, and the
creation of a training center for Tunisian customs officers.
Component design. The following facts have been taken into account in the design of this component:
* In Tunisia, sea transport accounts for approximately 95 percent of external trade, by tonnage.
* Sixty-one of imports and 70 percent of exports, by tonnage, are from and to Europe.
* The major nonbulk export is textiles (after oil, chemicals, and minerals).
* Most European ports of call are within 24 hours of Tunisia, with maximum travel time being 48
hours.
* The most important port for RORO and container traffic is Rades, which accounts for 92 percent of
tonnage.
* Containerized transport is expected to grow over the next few years at a rate of 15 percent per year by
traffic and 20 percent by tonnage.
Thus special emphasis has been placed on port and customs operations and associated commercial and
regulatory standards. Specifically, the component would consist of the fDllowing subcomponents:
(a) establishment of a common computer network for document interchange that would link private sector
firms, including manufacturers, shipping agents, freight forwarders, container terninal operators, and
customs brokers and computer systems of the Ministry of Commerce, the port authority (OMMP), and
customs. The network would be used to transmit and process shipping manifests, Ministry of Commerce
forms, customs declarations, and other relevant documents. This mechanism would bring substantial
benefits by eliminating the need for physical presentation and manual handling of documents among the
large number of participants in the trade documentation clearance process; (b) modernization of customs
procedures and customs computer application (SINDA), in line with international best practice, in order
3/ The major areas of inefficiency in trade-related procedures are presented in Annex 2A.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
to enable automated processing of customs declarations. Scanners would be acquired in order to provide
quick, thorough, and reliable verification of containers; (c) creation of a training center to overcome
difficulties resulting from lack of training (only 7 percent of 3,500 customs officers are trained). The
training center would be created on land already owned by the Government. With capacity for training
400 officers, this would provide customs with the ability to ensure improved and uniform service from its
staff. An existing Customs Documentation Center (Centre de recherche et de documentation, CRD)
would be provided with equipment to improve preparation and dissemination of customs-related
information.
Changes in information flow and processing. The Ministry of Commerce, customs, and the port authority
(OMMP) are presently computerized and are used to processing forms, documents, and declarations
related to external trade. The information exchange among these institutions and private sector
organizations is, however, paper based. Consequently the processing environment is inefficient
(duplication of data entry), slow (due to requirements for physical movement of documents), and error
prone (manual handling and multiple data entries). With implementation of the EDI server, the computer
systems of the above organizations will be linked in a common network that can be used forautomated
document exchange and processing. Professionals within the trade community would have access to the
network from their office PCs, to submit documents to the authorities. The EDI server would have built-
in logic to route every document submitted to one or more computer systems for relevant processing.
Once processing is completed, messages containing the appropriate responses would be automatically
sent back to the submitter; e.g., when a customs broker submits a customs declaration, the EDI server
would send the declaration to SINDA. The declaration would be automatically processed and a message
would be sent back to the customs broker, via the EDI server, to indicate whether it has been approved or
rejected by customs.
This intelligent network therefore would function as an electronic post office linked to computer systems
within the various authorities that can automatically receive, process, and respond to requests sent from
the trade community.
Implementation schedule and responsibilities. The implementation plan takes into consideration work
already carried out under a project funded by EU (Liasse unique). The Ministry of Commerce, customs,
OMMP, and private sector organizations have been working on simplification of procedures and
documents since August 1989, and the implementation plan reflects prompt actions that can be taken to
build on work already completed.4 Given the broad scope of the component, distinct phases and timing
have been planned as follows (see Table 3):
The first phase of the component, targeted for completion in December 1999, will reduce delays that
result from inefficient steps for submission of shipping manifests. This would be achieved by requesting
shipping agents to submit manifests electronically using EDIFACT format. The manifests would be
transmitted via an EDI network that would be established and operated by the Ministry of Commerce.
The current allowable delay for submitting manifests to customs is 48 hours from vessel arrival. This
delay can be gradually reduced and eventually eliminated, if manifests are submitted prior to vessel
arrival - planned for 2002 - thereby saving two days in the process.
The second phase of the component, planned for December 2000, would enable quick automated
responses (within 15 minutes) for customs declarations through real-time automated processing. (Current
manual processing of declarations can take up to three days.) The new customs declaration form would
be redefined in line with recommendations of the World Customs Organization. In order to support
automated processing of declarations, SINDA redesign would include capabilities for establishing
selectivity criteria to assist in verification of suspect declarations and goods. Customs clearance
procedures would also be modified to reduce delays by adopting post-event auditing techniques. This
would assist in reducing physical inspections at clearance time while at the same time enabling customs to

Country: Tunisia                                      Project Title: Export Development Project
focus on higher-risk declarations. In addition to the benefits of much quicker response, the automated
processing of customs declarations and automated submission of responses to declarants would provide a
transparent environment within which issues associated with declaration processing can be identified and
resolved.
The third phase of the component consists of the creation of the customs training center, to be completed
in 2001. This will be an essential tool to ensure that customs officers, many of whom are directly
involved with external trade operations, have the proper training to uniformly implement new procedures
and regulations. Current options for training are not practical and do not meet the needs of customs. This
is reflected by the low number of adequately trained officers (7 percent). Technical assistance would also
be provided to customs for identification and analysis of specific tasks of customs officers and ensuing
pedagogical requirements. The Ministry of Equipment would supervise civil vworks, as per GoT's decree
for this kind of civil work. The National Training Center Centre national de laformation continue et de
la promotion professionnelle (CNFCPP) would provide assistance for course preparation. Customs would
also design and offer courses and information updates to professionals within the trade community.
Management. Given the multiple Government organizations involved in this component, a Technical
Committee (Comite technique) would be responsible for coordination of the different subcomponents. A
coordinator would be designated by the Ministry of Commerce, and representatives from customs,
OMMP, and key private sector organizations would be members of the Technical Committee. Members
would be responsible for managing their respective subcomponents according to the overall plan.

ANNEX 2A
Tunisia: Export Development Project
Major Areas of Inefficiencies in Trade Procedures
A. PORT AND CARGO HANDLING
Submission of manifests. At the very beginning of the chain of the trade process for imports, the
regulatory requirements create room for inefficiencies that can introduce significant delays in the delivery
of goods arriving by ship. Under current customs regulations, shipping agents have up to ten days from
arrival of the ship to submit to the cargo-handling operator a reconciled version of the manifest. Since
goods cannot be removed from the port without identification against a manifest lodged with customs, the
impact of delayed submission of manifest is severe.
Document handling.  While the individual organizations associated with port operations are
computerized (STAM, OMMP, customs), there is no electronic informnation exchange infrastructure. This
leads to inefficient movement of hardcopy documents (manifests, good removal notifications, etc.) and
processing delays. The process of manifest acquittal is repeated within STAM, OMMP, and customs.
Congestion within container yard. In the port of Rades, there is continuously about 10 percent over-
stock of containers in the yard. While there are various causes for this, this leads to storage of containers
within unmarked areas. While it takes longer to locate containers that have been stored within those
unmarked areas, the current delay is reported to be manageable, since containers are grouped within
specific zones associated with the canying vessel. However, unless corrective measures are applied,
delays will lengthen given the rapid increase (15 percent per year) in the number of containers that transit
through the port of Rades.
B. CUSTOMS
Tunisian customs is a highly professional, well-trained, and disciplined organization. The principal
computer system used for customs processing is SINDA. About 10 years ago, customs was at the
forefront of application of information technology with the inhouse development and implementation of
SINDA. The system has, however, not been updated since then and its operational constraints have been
recognized by customs.
Declaration processing. Customs brokers as well as traders can enter declarations directly into SINDA.
These declarations are used for internal customs processing requirements. Declarants must, however, go
to a customs office for signature of the declaration forn in order for the declaration to be formally
accepted by customs. Once the declaration is approved, the declarant must again go to the customs office
to obtain the approved declaration form and pay relevant customs dues. This process is time consuming
and inefficient, since it requires the physical presence of the declarant or his/her representative at the
customs office at least twice. In addition, the process can be subjective, since the review of declarations
is totally manual and dependent on the individual customs officer assigned.
Manifest acquittal. Customs writes off delivery of goods against the manifest. This procedure has
traditionally served as a control mechanism to track delivered and undelivered goods. With the lack of
connectivity with the cargo handling operator, the goods delivery notification process is manual and
requires physical handling of a goods delivery notice to customs for acquittal.
Selectivity capabilities. No automated procedures are in place for a systematic and standard review of
declarations to deternine cases that should be subject to closer scrutiny by customs. Decisions to select
declarations for detailed assessment can be subjective. It is difficult within such an operational
environment to implement targets for selectivity rates, or to monitor and manage the success of specific
selectivity criteria. These can only be implemented and managed with the assistance of automated tools.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
Compliance with Year 2000. Customs has established that the current implementation of SINDA is not
Year 2000 compliant. Development and implementation of a new version of SINDA is therefore a key
priority for customs.
C. TECHNICAL CONTROLS
The Ministry of Commerce coordinates the requirements for technical controls, which are carried out by
various ministries and departments, depending on the product being examined. Issues have been raised
regarding the immobilization of products while samples are taken for technical control. The Ministry of
Commerce will launch a study to assess possibilities of streamlining technical control processes, e.g. by
setting up a unit for controls near the busy points of entry/exit of goods.
D. PROFESSIONAL SKILLS
The best systems and tools still require adequately skilled human resources to operate. Representatives of
all sectors (customs, trade professionals, cargo-handling operators, etc.) have raised the need to
continuously enhance and raise the skills of staff within their organizations.
In order to bring about significant and far-reaching changes in Tunisia's trade processes, a concerted
approach is required to address the constraints identified above. The changes required are multi-
organizational and involve both the public and private sectors. The changes are also multidimensional.
They involve:
*  Skills upgrading;
*  Simplification of procedures;
*  Enhancements to the legal and regulatory framework; and
*  An integrated set of information systems that allows exchange and processing of information among
trade professionals and regulatory authorities.
Successful implementation of this broad set of activities among a diverse set of stakeholders will require

ANNEX 4
TUNISIA -- EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SOCIOECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THE EMAF AND PEFG
Expected socioeconomic benefits from the EMAF. It is likely that initially about 350 firms would
benefit from the EMAF. Most beneficiaries are expected to be firms with no prior international market
sales, and the remainder exporters interested in diversifying their product/market mix (e.g., the existing
subcontractors in the garment sector). They are expected to accrue international market awareness and
know-how, forming the basis for a change in business behavior, which in many cases will lead to
increased international competitiveness and outward-oriented growth. In immediate terms, this change
will be reflected in new international business market partners - market and product information sources,
suppliers, private associations, potential buyers, potential foreign investors, etc.
In quantitative terms, a first-order ex-ante economic assessment was prepared (see project files for
pertinent data) based on an EMAF of US$10 million reaching 350 small and medium-scale firms. For the
assessment, a number of simplifying assumptions were made:
*  An average US$28,500 grant (accorded from the EMAF) would increase exports by 2.5 times in the
first year after the program is implemented, 5 times in second year, and 15 times in the third year;.
then all benefits would stop (the enterprise may shift to another product, market saturates, etc.). This
has been the observed outcome of many such programs elsewhere (see project files).
*  According to experience in other countries, such as Madagascar, Ecuador, and Mauritius, this growth
path takes into account the possibility that half of the beneficiaries of the EMAF might not produce
significant exports.
-  Benefits are discounted at the 180 day LIBOR rate of 6.0 percent.
-  Value-added distribution within this export stream is based on average observed data for Ecuador,
with fairly high weight assigned to agrobusiness and light manufacturing, thus making it applicable,
as a gross estimate, to Tunisia.
e  Taxes on exporting firm are calculated on average fiscal recovery, not nominal rates, which are
assumed to be 17.5 percent on payroll taxes and 20 percent on income.
*  Taxes on export firm employees, also based on recovery rates, are 9.35 percent on salaries and
3 percent effective based on VAT paid out of salaries on expenses in the economy.
The results presented in Table 4.1 show that the incremental nontraditional processed exports would be
significant and would make a substantial and visible positive impact on worker income and employment.
As qualitative gains are translated into incremental exports, this can be expected to yield roughly
(a) higher value added (mainly wages and profits) in export products; (b) broader export market linkages
(more products exported by more firms); and (c) more linkages to domestic producers as indirect
exporters (share of local raw materials, intermediate, and finished goods in product cost). In the case of a
US$10 million EMAF, covering 350 firms on average, incremental exports would total on the order of
US$225 million over a 5-year period, with a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$185.5. The present value of
the related value added yields about US$29 million as workers salaries, US$38 million to the financial
sector (we assume that one-half of export expansion is from expansion investments and the other half
from new investments; therefore banks participate in financing), and US$28 million from profits. The
present value of the total indirect tax recovery on this grant would be about US$45 million.

Expected socioeconomic benefit from the PEFG. Table 4.2 shows a preliminary estimate of net social
benefits of the PEFG operation based on a PEFG fund of US$5 million during the initial five years, under
the following assumptions:
* As the PEFG agency, commercial banks, and SME exporters learn about the PEFG operation, the
guarantee coverage fund ratio would gradually increase from 2 in the first year to 4 in the second
year, 8 in the third year, 10 in the fourth year, and 15 in the fifth year. (The international norm of the
guarantee coverage ratio is up to 15 to 20 for a well-managed guarantee fund.)
*  Average annual turnover of preshipment export finance is three (i.e., the average preshipment export
finance maturity is four months).
*  For an export order of US$ 1, the PEFG would cover US$0.81 (90 percent loan share times 90 percent
guarantee share).
*  Additional annual exports of US$1 million would generate an additional 100 jobs.
*  Social benefits of the PEFG operation are measured by the additionally generated export value-added
which is assumed to be 50 percent of the additional export value.
*  Social costs of the PEFG operation are composed of:
i. net defaults (i.e., gross defaults minus recoveries);
ii. administrative costs;
iii. opportunity cost of the fund.
*  Net default rate would decline from 4 percent in the first year to 3 percent in the second year,
2 percent in the third year, 1.5 percent in the fourth year, and 1 percent in the fifth year as a result of
technical assistance provided to SME exporters, these exporters' learning-by-exporting, and improved
collection of defaulted exporters' unpaid debt.
-  PEFG administrative costs would be 2.0 percent of the guarantee outstanding, in the initial phase, and
decline according to the schedule shown in Table 4.2
It is estimated that US$1 fund can cover US$3.7 on annual exports, if the fund-PEFG coverage ratio is 1
( {1/(0.9)(0.9)} {3} = 3.7 ). Under the assumption that when the PEFG scheme is fully implemented
under good management, the fund - PEFG coverage ratio will be 15, one can es,timate that US$1 fund can
cover US$55.5 in annual exports ({3.7} { 15}) = 55.5 ). Therefore, a US$5 million PEFG fund can cover
US$280 million annual exports after five years. Alternatively, one can show that if the average import
contents of the Tunisian garment exports are 60 percent of the export values and the PEFG coverages are
limited to the import finance for export production, about US$463 million garment exports per year can
be transforned from international subcontract-based trade to export L/C and associated import L/C-based
trade, based on a US$5 million PEFG fund. The NPV of the benefits amount to $277 million for the first
5 years of the program.
Financial status estimate.. A preliminary estimate of the financial status of the PEFG Fund and
operation during the initial five years is also presented in Table 4.2, In this estimate, in addition to the
assumptions made above, the following are assumed:
* Annual premium fate applied to guarantee outstanding is 1.8 percent.
* Fund's annual interest earnings are 4 percent.
* Temporary losses in the initial 3 years would be financed by borrowing.

Expected benefits from trade facilitation. The simplification of trade and customs procedures, training
of customs officials to implement the simplified procedures, and enhancing the electronic commerce
capacities are expected to reduce transaction costs of Tunisian exports and thereby improve
competitiveness of Tunisian firms. Currently, it can take up to 18 days for an importer to receive goods
after they have been unloaded at the port. The average time taken is around 8 days. The project would
introduce methods and techniques by which these times could be reduced from 2 to 3 days.
In quantitative terms, a number of assumptions are made for a first-order economic analysis, based on an
investment of about US$19 million over three years:
*  According to international experience (e.g., Singapore), the transactions costs associated with
processing trade documents amount to 4 percent to percent of the value of the product imported or
exported. This experience has shown that streamlining procedures and introducing electronic
commerce, are estimated to reduce these transactions costs by more than 30 percent, representing
savings of between 1 and 2.5 percent of merchandise trade. For the current analysis, we assume a
savings of one percent of merchandise trade over time.
*  The savings due to the new system of electronic commerce and streamlined customs procedures will
be realized gradually, following the schedule depicted in Table 4.3: 20 percent, 50 percent, and 80
percent, respectively, for the three years following implementation of the streamlined procedures and
the EDI server.
This would lead to benefits equivalent to about US$200 million over the life of the project.

Annex 6
Export Development Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement responsibilities and arrangements are explained in paragraph C.5.2 of main report.
Procurement under the project will be in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, revised in January 1999, using standard bid documents and contract forms agreed
with the Bank. The procurement arrangement, contract thresholds, and Bank financing ratios are indicated
in tables A, B, and C of this Annex. Consultants will be selected in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, revised in January 1999, using standard contract formns agreed with
the Bank. In the case of Preshipment Export Finance Guarantee, the Bank's funds will be against eligible
subloans.
Civil works concern the construction and/or renovation of custom's training and documentation centers
and testing laboratory. The works consist of several small contracts to be procured through NCB. The
type of equipment required includes pedagogic material, testing equipment, software and computers,
equipment for the documentation center, etc. Contracts not exceeding US$400,000 will be procured
through NCB and contracts exceeding US$400,000 will be procured through ICB. Services concern
technical assistance, institutional building and training, and, with the exception of contracts below
US$50,000, the QCBS method will be used. Consultant contracts costing less than US$50,000 per
contract may, with the Bank's prior approval, be procured through single source. Services under EMAF
are relatively small and will be procured in accordance with commercial practice by inviting a minimum
of three consultants and, wherever agreed with the Bank, by sole sourcing.
Procurement methods and prior review thresholds are detailed in table A and B, respectively.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (see Table C)
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs)
Disbursement against works contracts exceeding US$750,000 equivalent, goods contracts exceeding
US$400,000, and consultants' contracts exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals
will be fully documented. For all other expenditures, disbursements could be made against statements of
expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documents for SOEs will not be submitted to the Bank, but will be
retained by the project's implementing agency and made available to the Bank's staff during supervision.
The EMAF management team will prepare supporting documentation.
To facilitate implementation of the Export Market Access and Trade Facilitation components, a special
account in dollars would be established at the Central Bank for each component. The authorized
allocation of US$1,000,000 would be limited to US$600,000 until the aggregate withdrawals from the
loan account reach US$3,000,000. The special account would be replenished on a monthly basis or when
at least one-third of the balance has been withdrawn, whichever occurs first.  Documentation
requirements for replenishment applications would follow the procedures outlined in the above paragraph.
In addition, monthly reconciled bank statements of the special account will accompany all replenishment
requests. The special account would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
With regard to the Preshipment Export Finance Guarantee component, the IBRD loan proceeds of
US$2,000,000 (equivalent to four months of expected guarantee coverage), would be disbursed into a
special account. These proceeds would be transferred into an escrow account against the issuance of
guarantee certificates. The special account would be replenished (up to the US$5.0 million allocated for
this component) upon the issuance by the PEFG agency of guarantee certificates equivalent to the initial
balance of the special account.

Financial Management System
Three entities, namely COTUNACE, CEPEX, and Tunisian customs, are involved in the execution of this
project under the direction of the Ministry of Commerce. Thus, the financial management assessment has
covered these three entities.
Tunisian customs. The financial management system in place is currently in a transition phase. A
modernization and upgrading program was started in 1994 and has allowed the approval and adoption of
an organization chart characterized by a matrix organization, which tends to reinforce decentralization
and upstream and downstream controls. The accounting books are maintained on a cash basis system
according to regulations described in the Public Accounting Law. However, the information system is
quite developed and allows, through numerous applications, generation of the necessary information for
the management of operational activity. The Department of Financial Affairs which reports to the
Division of Department's Support, has since 1996 been responsible for following up expenses and orders
to pay. Although it is globally satisfactory, the existing financial management system should be improved
in order to achieve the required efficiency. The main lines of improvement would be related to : (a) the
increase of specialized staff in the accounting and financial fields in order to reinforce supervision; (b) the
implementation of the necessary tools for rigorous follow-up of liabilities and control of expenses through
the development of an integrated computerized system, which should be in relation to the needs as well as
the current and forecasted workload; (c) implementation of a system of follow-up and control of fixed
assets and inventories; (d) the formalization of work rules through development of a manual of financial
management procedures and their implementation; and (e) the development of a continuous staff training
program and its implementation.
COTUNA CE. The Compagnie tunisienne pour l'assurance du commerce exterieur (Tunisian Company
for the Insurance of External Commerce) is a limited company with 60 percent of its capital held directly
by the Tunisian Government and 40 percent held by Tunisian banks and insurance companies. It operates
under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance and is thus subject to the regulations applicable to public
companies. Its accounting system was upgraded in 1997 through the adoption of the new accounting
system for companies promulgated by Law 96-112 dated December 30, 1996 and is thus in conformity
with generally accepted international accounting standards. The management information system is quite
developed, with an adequate level of computerization. The downstream control system is operational and
is materialized through the General Secretary, the Internal Auditor, and the management committees. In
addition to these controls ensured by the internal structures, there are controls performed by external
organs such as Government Auditor, Government Accounting Office, High Control Committee, Ministry
of Finance, and Ministry of Commerce. Every three years an auditor who belongs to the Tunisian Institute
of Certified Public Accountants is designated, in conformity with the procedures decreed by the
regulations in force. The audit reports of the last three fiscal years have been issued without any
qualification on the financial statements. Given these characteristics, the financial management system
can be considered globally satisfactory even if some improvements should be introduced to reach the
required efficiency. These are mainly: (a) updating the Procedures Manual in order to take into account
the operational and organizational development and its implementation; (b) computerization of the
budgeting system and its integration into the accounting application in order to set up an efficient
management control system; (c) development of a system of global integration of computer applications
aimed at eliminating redundancies and generating automatic control panels for executive management; (d)
the elaboration and development of a system of cost followup by activity, allowing better estimation of
premiums to be invoiced; and (e) introduction of an application for evaluating risks using a scoring
system. This tool shall help considerably to improve the decisionmaking process.

CEPEX The Centre de promotion des exportations (Center for the Promotion of Exports) is a state
company with a non-administrative character endowed with civilian status and financial autonomy.
Created in 1973, it operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Commerce and is thus subject to the
regulations applicable to state companies. Its accounting system was upgraded in 1997 through the
adoption of the new accounting system for companies decreed by Law 96-112 dated December 30, 1996,
and is thus in conformity with generally accepted international accounting standards. The management
information system is globally satisfactory and has reached a noticeable degree of computerization. The
upstream control system is ensured by a management committee, the internal audit unit, and the
Department of Budget and Management Control. In addition to these three levels of internal controls,
there are controls by external organs such as Government Auditor, Govermnent Accounting Office, High
Control Committee, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Commerce. Every three years an auditor, who is
a member of the Tunisian Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is designated in conformity with the
procedures decreed by the regulation in force. The audit reports of the last three fiscal years have been
issued without any qualifications on the financial statements. Given these characteristics, the financial
management system can be considered globally satisfactory even if some improvements should be
introduced to reach the required efficiency. These are mainly: (a) updating and implementing of a Manual
of Procedures in order to take into account the evolution of the activities and role of the CEPEX;
(b) elaboration of an accounting manual in conformity with the Tunisian regulations in force in order to
formalize the procedures adopted for the preparation and the issuing of accounting and financial
information; (c) updating the computer scheme elaborated in 1997 and its implementation while making
sure of the integration of the applications relating to the information system, as well as those relating to
databases; and (d) improvement of the planning and budgeting system by adlding an adequate level of
details in conformity with the subdivisions used in the accounting system.
Organization of the project. The project would be implemented by customs, COTUNACE, CEPEX, and
Ministry of Commerce. Each agency would be in charge of a specific component. A Steering Committee
consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of International Cooperation, and
Ministry of Economic Development, as well as the three executing agencies, would be in charge of the
followup and physical implementation of each component. A Project Manager from the Ministry of
Commerce cabinet has been designated and will ensure the centralization of accounting and financial data
and execution reports, and the issuing of the project accounts. He/she will also be in charge of organizing
the meetings of the Directing Committee and preparing of the files to be submilted to the Committee.
In order to formalize the methods of execution of the components with which they have been entrusted,
COTUNACE and CEPEX have elaborated operational guidelines that define the targets to be reached, the
rules to be respected, the authorization process, the role of each participant, as well as the expense
liability process and the method of disbursement of the loan and the procedures and policies of financial
flow transactions. However, the project's Procedures Manual for financial management has not yet been
elaborated. This manual shall include the principles and rules governing: (a) the drawing up of forecasts
and budgets; (b) bookkeeping of the project's accounts, including the accounting principles and the
detailed chart of accounts as well as the procedures for the centralization of accounting data at the level of
the Coordination Unit; (c) the internal control system applicable to the project, including the financial
flow and job descriptions of the project team; (d) the procedures and resources for issuing project
management reports, as well as the format and contents; and (e) audit arrangements for the project,
including specific terms of reference for the annual assignment. This manual shall be developed with the
assistance of an external consultant and submitted for the approval of the Steering Committee before its
implementation. It would be updated during the project's life in the light of the implementation experience
in order to take into account possible changes. The implementation of this manual would be accompanied
by a memorandum of understanding signed by each execution agency, which will reflect their
commitment and adhesion to the procedures adopted for project monitoring.

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
Financial flow. The execution of the project's components is mainly entrusted to the three execution
agencies, which will operate in complete independence in terms of procurement, disbursements,
payments, and submission of statements of expenditure. Three special accounts will be opened at the
Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) and will be managed in conformity with the dispositions of the Loan
Agreement. Requests for replenishment will be issued by the responsible of the special account within
BCT and transmitted to the Bank based statements prepared by the execution agencies and the project
coordinator. Financial management of operations related to the project shall be ensured independently by
each execution agency, and specific codes will be assigned to each expense category. This codification
will be recorded in the financial management procedures manual in order to enable adequate followup
and the needed reconciliation.
Accounting and financial management rules. The principles that govern the accounting and financial
management of the project on the level of the execution agencies, as well as on the level of the
coordination unit in charge of centralization, shall be recorded in the Financial Management Procedures
Manual. These principles are of crucial importance to ensure transparency and clarity of financial
transactions for the various participants and parties involved in the execution of the project. They also
ensure coherence in terms of procedures, especially since three autonomous execution agencies are
involved in the management of the project. These rules shall define the principles to be used to:
(a) qualify expenses incurred as expenses related to the project, (b) identify expenses that are eligible for
Bank financing, (c) grant advances to the execution agencies and recording such operations on the
accounting books, (d) the accounting principles that govern the posting of the transactions. The execution
agencies must be committed to following rules that have been set and consigned in the Procedures
Manual. This commitment shall be reflected in the memorandum of understanding signed by the
committee of piloting and the execution agencies.
The project accounting system. The project coordinator shall be responsible for the elaboration of the
project's accounts by aggregation of the data in the statements developed by the execution agencies. The
project coordinator would be responsible for overall project financial management and accounting,
maintaining books of accounts, and preparing and disseminating financial statements and project
management reports. These report shall be prepared progressively according to the content and format
acceptable to the Bank. Requisite resources and arrangements would be planned and implemented to
allow preparation of such reports. He/she will ensure timely audit of the financial statements, allowing
the submission of the annual audit report no later than six months after the end of GoT' fiscal year.
The general principles governing the accounting system applicable to the project are as follows:
(i)    Each executing agency will ensure bookkeeping of the transactions related to components
managed under its responsibility according to double entry accounting. COTUNACE and CEPEX
will make sure to implement procedures that will allow the automatic transfer from their general
accounting system of all data related to the projects, so as to limit the risk of errors and to allow
reconciliation. Tunisian customs, which maintains a cash basis accounting system based on the
budget component, will develop a specific application for the project's accounts. This application
will include a cross indexing system, allowing reconciliation with the legal accounting books.
The project's accounting systems shall reflect payments as well as liabilities and related sources
of financing (own funds, state contribution, loan funds, and other contributions). The project's
account will be prepared by the Coordination Unit through the aggregation of accounting data
transmitted both by the implementing agencies and expenses incurred directly at the level of the
Ministry of Commerce.
(ii)    Transactions relating to the project shall be duly identified and set apart from those related to the
current activity of each implementing agency. Procedures for identification of the project's
transactions shall include rules for the transfer of accounting data from the general accounting
system to the project accounts. An auxiliary trial balance specific to the project shall be generated
in an automatic manner. The project's chart of accounts, developed by each executing agency,
shall conform to the component's details, as described in the project's documents (Project

Country: Tunisia                                      Project Title: Export Development Project
Implementation Plan, Project Appraisal Document, Costab). The chart of accounts shall also
allow the development of the Project Management Report and thus include the necessary
subdivisions.
(iii)   The project accounts and the Project Management Reports shall be developed exclusively using
the project's books and accounting ledger. COTUNACE and CEPEX shall generate their own
project accounts exclusively from their global accounting system.
(iv)   Data related to the physical implementation of the project's component, as well as key
performance evaluations, shall be clearly defined and included in the Financial Management
Manual. A system to reconcile accounting data and physical implementation shall be clearly
defined.
(v)    The centralization of accounting and financial data will be ensured through an application
designed for that purpose. The head of the Coordination Unit will make sure of the
implementation of this application and the formalization of governing operating methods.
Information flow related to the accounting system. The accounting transaction flow will be as
follows:
(i)    Ministry of Commerce shall maintain accounting books and files related to the centralization and
aggregation of financial and accounting data for each component managed by the implementing
agencies. Supporting documents related to the components managed directly by the Ministry of
Commerce will be kept at the level of the Coordination Unit.
(ii)   Central Bank of Tunisia will be responsible for management of the special accounts and for
keeping the supporting documents related to the project's transactions, including statements of
expenditures transmitted by the implementing agencies and Ministry of Commerce.
(iii)  Implementing agencies are responsible for keeping supporting documents related to the project
and to the funds received for the financing of project's expenses. A filing method and appropriate
reference system have to be implemented and formalized in the financial management procedures
manual.
Internal control system. The project financial management system would include the following internal
control mechanisms:
(i)    Operation of a budgeting system, and regular monitoring of actual financial performance with
budgets and targets.
(ii)   Adoption and operation of simple, clear, and transparent financial and accounting policies which
would govern financial management of and accounting for the project (as described earlier).
These policies and procedures shall be included in the Financial Management Procedures
Manual.
(iii)   At the transaction level, establishment and operation of policies, procedures, and systems for
ensuring standard internal controls such as checking of expenditures, appropriate documentation,
levels of authorization, segregation of duties, periodic reconciliation, physical verification, etc.
These policies and procedures should be formalized in the Financial Management Procedures
Manual.
(iv)   Establishment and operation of a comprehensive audit mechanism, including concurrent audit (as
described below).

Country: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
Financial management reports. Financial management reports shall be issued quarterly and annually.
Quarterly. The Coordination Unit head will be responsible for the Project Management Report, using the
subreports developed by the executing agencies. This report shall be considered a tool for project
monitoring, implementation followup, and decisionmaking. It shall be transmitted to the Bank no later
than 45 days after the end of each quarter and shall include: (a) a comparison of budgeted and actual
expenditure and analysis of major variances, including on sources and application of funds (by
components, expenditure categories, and implementing agencies), and on physical parameters and unit
rates for selected key items; (b) expenditures by disbursement category; and (c) forecasts for the next two
quarters. Formats and contents of the reports shall be described in the Financial Management Procedures
Manual.
Annually. Audited Project Financial Statements (PFS) will be submitted to the Bank and will include:
(a) a statement of sources and utilization of funds, or a balance sheet, indicating funds received from
various sources, project expenditures, and assets and liabilities of the project. This would also include
appropriate schedules classifying project expenditures by components, expenditure categories, and
implementing agencies; (b) a Special Account Reconciliation Statement; and (c) a Statement of
Withdrawals from the Bank loan made on the basis of statements of expenditure. The Coordination Unit
head would be responsible for overall project financial management and accounting. He/she would
maintain books of accounts for the project, prepare and disseminate financial statements and financial
management reports, and ensure timely audit of the financial statements.
Project team. The execution agencies will officially designate a team in charge of the project's
monitoring and will define the role and responsibilities of each team member in relation to the forecasted
workload (full or part time). This team will necessarily include a high-level staff with skills and
qualifications in accounting and finance. Job position descriptions should to define attributions and
responsibilities of the each team member.
At the level of the Ministry of Commerce, the Coordination Unit head will appoint an assistant with skills
and qualifications in accounting and finance. This assistant will be responsible for the processing of
accounting and financial data and ensuring their aggregation and the issuing of project accounts and the
Project Management Report on a timely basis.
Audit arrangements. The audit by the Project Auditor would be comprehensive and cover all aspects of
the project (i.e., all sources and utilization of funds, and expenditures incurred by all implementing
agencies). The audit will be carried out in accordance with international standards. The terms of
reference for the auditors include both audit of financial transaction, and an assessment of the operation of
the financial management system, including review of internal control mechanisms. All implementing
agencies shall provide the auditor with access to project-related documents and records, and information
required by the auditor for purposes of the audit. The Project Auditor will carry out a concurrent audit
during the fiscal year to bring to management's attention any issues that need to be addressed. This
would strengthen internal controls, and would also facilitate early completion of the annual audit. The
annual audit report as well as the management letter shall be submitted to the Bank within six months of
the close of the fiscal year.

Countiy: Tunisia                                        Project Title: Export Development Project
Readiness for implementation. The start of the project implementation shall be preceded by the
following actions:
(i)    Project organization, including official designation of the project team and appointment of new
staff, if needed;
(ii)    Development of the format and contents of the Project Management Report, including subreports
to be issued by implementing agencies;
(iii)   Development of the project's Financial Management Procedures Manual and its implementation
at the level of the execution agencies; and
(iv)   Appointment of auditors. Alternatively, the Inspection generale des finances (IGF) will be
designated as the project's auditor if acceptable to the Bank. This designation shall specify that
CGF inspectors will follow generally accepted auditing standards and terms of reference, which
will be transmitted by the Bank to cover all aspects related to project monitoring. This decision
will be made during the project negotiations.
Areas of improvement. Overall, the existing financial management system of COTUNACE, CEPEX,
and customs is satisfactory. However, there is still scope for improvement in some areas. It should be
noted that the proposed recommendations are related to weaknesses that do not impact the project's
financial management system and the requisite level of quality for the project's monitoring. In fact,
specific arrangements have been planned to mitigate risks related to the project's implementation. The
proposed recommendations for the three agencies aim to improve the management information systems
for their own activities and could be considered a general capacity-building program. The implementation
of this plan could be considered part of the project. However, a detailed action plan has to be developed
and submitted to the Bank before implementation begins.
Risk areas. There are two risks related to the project's financial management system, both involving to
the following aspects: (a) Tunisian customs operate a single-entry bookkeeping system, which would
need the implementation of an intermediary system in order to present, among other things, fixed assets
and liabilities in the format required by the Bank; and (b) absence of past expeirience in the management
of projects financed by the Bank at the level of the three executing agencies.
However, these risks can be mitigated by the existence of financial management systems that are deemed
globally satisfactory and by the experience acquired by the ministries that are members of the Steering
Committee and the BCT.
The Bank will address these risks during the project's launch by providing the necessary technical
assistance. The residual risks will be subject to rigorous followup during the supervision missions and
will lead to recommendations for improvement.
