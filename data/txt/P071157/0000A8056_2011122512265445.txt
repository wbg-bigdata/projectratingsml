                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has supported the drafting of three interrelated legislative proposal: (i) a bill establishing the new Lands Commission, which was adopted by Parliament in 2008; (ii) a
                         Lands Bill; and (iii) a Land Use and Planning Bill. The preparation of the Land Use and Planning Bill has progressed well and the Bill is likely to be tabled before parliament by June
                         30, 2011. As for the Lands Bill, while its preparation has produced several drafts and a few rounds of consultations, it is now certain that its preparation and processing will roll over
                         into LAP 2 as the consultant engaged to facilitate the process was unable to ensure completion of high quality drafts of the Bill and the reaching of consensus on certain key issues
                         during the contract period. The project has supported also the preparation of strategic plans and business re-engineering processes. The preparation is on-going and will continue
                         under LAP2 together with the second phase of the associated LIS. The closing date for the project was extended by 6 months from December 2010 to June 2011 to transition
                         smoothly with LAP2 which is expected to become effective by June 30, 2011
