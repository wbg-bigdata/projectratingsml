F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document, page 3):

To develop a sustainable and well-functioning land administration system that is fair, efficient,
cost effective, decentralized, and that enhances land tenure security through: (a) harmonizing
land policies and the legislative framework with customary law for sustainable land
administration; (b) undertaking institutional reform and capacity building for comprehensive
improvement in the land administration system; (c) establishing an efficient, fair, and transparent
system of land titling, registration, and valuation; (d) developing community-level land dispute
resolution mechanisms; and (e) issuing and registering land titles in selected pilot urban and rural
areas.

Revised Project Development Objective (as approved by original approving authority):

The revised PDO is to undertake land policy and institutional reforms and key land administration
pilots for laying the foundation for a sustainable, decentralized land administration system that is fair,
efficient, and cost effective and ensures land tenure security.

The PDO and outcome indicators were revised during restructuring with slight modifications to
project components.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal

At the time of appraisal of the Ghana Land Administration Project (LAP) in July 2003, the
Government of Ghana had completed and adopted its National Land Policy in June 1999, and
thus the general and specific objectives for land reform were already defined for donors. The
policy’s goals were to:
     • Harmonize statutory laws and customary practices to facilitate equitable access to land
       and enhance security of land tenure by systematically registering all interests in land.
     • Minimize and eliminate where possible the sources of protracted land boundary disputes,
       conflicts, and litigation to bring their associated economic costs and sociopolitical
       upheavals under control.
     • Ensure payment of fair compensation within a reasonable time for land acquired by the
       State from customary or private landowners.
     • Instill order and discipline in the land market to curb the incidence of land encroachment,
       unapproved development schemes, multiple or illegal land sales, land speculation, and
       other forms of land racketeering.
     • Create and maintain effective institutional capacity and capability for delivering land
       services at the national, regional, district, and (where appropriate) community levels.
     • Promote community and participatory land management and land use planning within a
       decentralized planning system.
     • Formalize land markets where appropriate, and promote business-like and professional
       property management principles with the aim of securing optimal economic, financial,
       and social returns and moving towards a self-financing land administration system.

Aside from supporting the National Land Policy, the project supported the 2000 Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) and Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), which aimed to
reduce the incidence of rural and urban poverty and strengthen the capabilities of the poor and
vulnerable to earn an income. The project contributed to these various goals by facilitating
access to land and improving security of rights and interests in land.

The project was designed to support implementation of the 15 to 25 year program emanating
from the National Land Policy. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources (MLNR) was the
lead Ministry implementing the project, in collaboration with other ministries and institutions
such as the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning; Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development; Ministry of Environment, Science, and Technology; Ministry of Food and
Agriculture; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Trade and Industry; the Judiciary; and the National
House of Chiefs.

Activities under the project were implemented initially through the six land agencies operating at
that time: the Lands Commission, Survey and Mapping Division, Land Registration Division,
Land Valuation Division, the Office of the Administrator of Stool Lands, and Town and Country
Planning Department. In 2008, the Survey and Mapping Division, Land Registration Division,


                                                1
Land Valuation Division, and the Lands Commission were merged into one entity, the National
Lands Commission (NLC). The original Lands Commission became the Public and Vested
Lands Management Division of the NLC.

The project was coordinated at MLNR by the Land Administration Program Unit (LAPU),
headed by a project director. The LAP originally was to be implemented over five years, from
October 2003 to December 2008. At the request of the Government of Ghana, however, five of
the six development partners supporting the project—the Bank, Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), KfW, German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), and
Nordic Development Fund (NDF)—extended their closing date to December 31, 2010. DFID
support to LAP ended on August 31, 2009, following an extension from March 2009. The
closing date was November 30, 2011 for NDF and December 31, 2011 for KfW. Bank finance
finally closed on June 30, 2011, following an additional six-month extension at the request of the
government.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

Original development objective
The original development objective of the LAP was to develop a sustainable and well-
functioning land administration system that would be fair, efficient, cost effective, decentralized,
and would enhance land tenure security. The objective was to be achieved through:
   (a) Harmonizing land policies and the legislative framework with customary law for
       sustainable land administration.
   (b) Undertaking institutional reforms and capacity building for comprehensive improvement
       in the land administration system.
   (c) Establishing an efficient, fair, and transparent system of land titling, registration, land use
       planning, and valuation.
   (d) Piloting the issuance and registration of land titles in selected urban and rural areas as a
       means of testing (b) and (c) as well as innovative methodologies, including mechanisms
       for resolving community land disputes.

Original key performance indicators
To achieve this objective, several key performance indicators 3 were established:
   1. Land policy and legislative review completed, and codified land legislation drafted and
       approved by Cabinet.
   2. Improved land administration procedures and information system implemented, making
       access to land easier and transaction costs lower.
   3. Reduced number of land litigation cases in courts in the pilot land titling and registration
       areas.
   4. Increased investment in the property sector as security for landowners and users is
       enhanced, and mortgage financing facilitated, in pilot land titling and registration areas.
   5. Increased revenues from land transactions in pilot land titling and registration areas.
   6. Public land agencies are restructured, and customary land administration authorities
       strengthened.

      7. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), communities, and the private sector play an
         active role in land administration.
      8. An increased number of land titles are registered by women.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The project was originally designed as an Adjustable Program Loan in conformity with the
timeframe for implementing the National Land Policy, but Bank management decided during the
Decision Meeting that the project would be implemented through a five-year Specific Investment
Loan, followed with an Adjustable Program Loan in subsequent phases. The original PDO for
the Adjustable Program Loan was not modified to conform to the revised five-year
implementation period, and it became clear during implementation that the PDO could not be
achieved in that timeframe. Its achievement required a phased approach as originally planned,
beginning by laying the foundation for an accelerated overhaul of the land administration system.
For these reasons, the PDO was revised as follows: to undertake land policy and institutional
reforms and key land administration pilots for laying the foundation for a sustainable,
decentralized land administration system that is fair, efficient, and cost effective and ensures
land tenure security.? 4

Revised project outcome indicators and targets
The project’s outcome indicators were revised to reflect the revised PDO and to be more
measurable. The following changes were introduced (see Annex 2 for details):
   • Outcome indicator (1) was reformulated with greater specificity to be more measurable.
   • Indicator (2) was vague and thus difficult to measure; baseline data could not be obtained
       easily. It was modified to be more realistic and measurable.
   • Outcome indicators (4) and (5) were dropped because it would have been difficult to
       attribute outcomes to project activities.
   • Three new outcome indicators (5, 6, and 7) were added to measure progress in ongoing
       legislative reforms and measure how efficiently the judiciary system supported the land
       administration system.

Revised outcome indicators
Accordingly, the revised outcome indicators were:
   1a. Turnaround time in registering deeds reduced to less than one month countrywide.
   1b. Turnaround time in registering titles reduced to less than six months in declared and
       mapped title registration areas.
   2. Land litigation cases decreased in courts of three pilot areas (Ejisu, Wasa Akropong, and
       Gbawe).
   3. Land transaction revenues to local and central government increased by 130 percent.
   4a. Land titles registered by women increased by 50 percent in declared and mapped
       registration areas.
   4b. Deeds registered by women increased by 50 percent countrywide.
   5. Land Agency Act passed by Parliament and operational.

   6. Substantive Land Act passed by Parliament and operational.
   7. Backlog of land litigation cases lodged at high courts and circuit courts in all 10 regional
      capitals decreased.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

In general, Ghana’s entire population was expected to benefit from legislative reviews that would
help consolidate the plethora of land laws and harmonize them with customary land
administration practices. Land agencies and traditional landowners were expected to benefit from
institutional reforms, more streamlined business procedures, and capacity strengthening. In
communities where systematic land titling was piloted, the demarcation of customary boundaries
of allodial land and the titling and registration of land interests were expected to increase the
security of land tenure and reduce litigation. Private enterprises, central government and security
agencies, and research institutions were other beneficiaries.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

Amendment of the Development Credit Agreement
The Development Credit Agreement (Schedule 4) was amended in 2008 to reflect changes to the
PDO, project components, and key performance indicators and to include the small grants
program.

Extension of closing date
To complete the reforms and pilots supported by the project and enable the government to use
the lessons from that experience to develop subsequent phases of the land administration
program, the project’s closing date was extended from December 31, 2008 to December 31,
2010, and subsequently extended to June 30, 2011, following the second restructuring.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background
As the first project focusing exclusively on land administration that the World Bank supported in
Africa, the LAP’s design benefitted from the Bank’s experiences with land reform and titling
projects outside Africa and from its experience within Ghana over the years. The World Bank
has assisted in many land reform and titling efforts since issuing its “Land Reform Policy Paper?
in 1975. Three major lessons from the Bank's experience were particularly relevant to the
project’s design. First, land policy should be viewed as an integral element of a broader policy
dialogue rather than as a string of narrowly oriented technical interventions. Second, land titling
should be area-based; in other words, it should cover an entire area at once (systematic
registration), and fit within a broader strategy of rural development. Third, traditional
arrangements for land rights are valuable and should be recognized explicitly. The LAP was
designed to incorporate those lessons by emphasizing the broader policy dialogue, systematic
land registration, and the decentralization of land services, with due consideration for local
situations and participation of stakeholders, including traditional or customary landowners.

In addition to reflecting best practices from outside sub-Saharan Africa, the project reflected
experiences from within Ghana, especially lessons from community involvement in development
projects in agriculture, water, and forest management that had recorded considerable progress.
That experience reinforced the need for stakeholder participation, and consequently ensuring
stakeholders’ input in resolving land disputes, titling, and registering interests in land became a
centerpiece for the LAP. The private sector’s participation in the LAP was modeled along the
lines of the Ghana Urban Mapping Programs, in which the private sector shouldered a good part
of the technical effort and freed the Survey Department to focus on other aspects of map
production. The role of the private sector was enhanced to include not only surveyors but also
lawyers, private contractors, and NGOs in the decentralization of land management and
development of capacity in customary land administration. The project also facilitated and
enhanced private sector capacity through training and by providing equipment, books, and
training facilities to diploma and degree institutions offering courses in surveying and land
administration.

Aside from incorporating that experience, project preparation benefited from a comprehensive
review of the land sector by a team of local and international experts; about 22 other documents
were either prepared or consulted. 5 Project preparation drew on the expertise and rigorous
analysis of a multisectoral team appropriately matched to the demands of formulating such a
wide-ranging project. These efforts ensured that the LAP was designed based on informed
decisions and reflected the government’s development priorities, particularly those specified in
the GPRS and National Land Policy.

The task team consulted widely with development partners supporting the land sector in Ghana,
which made it possible to marshal broad donor support for Ghana’s land sector for the first time.
Ultimately six donors, including the World Bank, agreed to support the program: GIZ, KfW, and
NDF provided parallel support whereas CIDA, DFID, and the Bank provided joint support (see
Annex 1). Donors agreed to use a common annual work program, M&E, and reporting systems.

In sum, after due consultation with partners, the LAP was originally designed to be a multiphase,
15- to 20-year program financed through an Adaptable Program Lending instrument. It would
provide a framework for multidonor support, with a shared annual work program, M&E system,
and reporting system, and at the same time it would give individual donors the flexibility to
apply separate procurement, financial management, and disbursement guidelines and procedures.
Table 1 presents the consolidated financing plan for what was originally conceived as the
project’s first phase.

Assessment of risks
The PAD assigned an overall risk rating of “substantial? to the project. Four risks to attaining the
project objective were identified and they were associated with the following actions:
    • Sustained political commitment was required for a long-term, participatory land
        administration reform program, including commitment from customary land authorities,
        civil society, and the private sector.




                                                         7
   •   The government needed to pass legislation mandating policy reforms, including the
       restructuring of public land agencies.
   •   The government needed to continue its support for participatory land administration by
       traditional authorities and the private sector.
   •   Governance would need to improve to effect administrative and fiscal decentralization
       and check corruption.

The team mitigated these risks by developing and incorporating public awareness strategies to
facilitate broad-based understanding (including throughout civil society) of the legislative
reforms, opportunities for stakeholder participation, and capacity building for land agencies and
other stakeholders.

Although the present assessment concurs with the conclusion that the project entailed
“substantial? risks, those risks ultimately came from sources other than those identified in the
PAD. They came from Ghana’s fragmented land institutions and weak project management
capacity, the project’s unanticipated scope (which some stakeholders described as “unwieldy?),
and the substantial challenge of coordinating donors, which required considerable time and
energy and added to the risk of failure. For example, DFID’s focus in Ghana shifted during
implementation and support ceased midway; GTZ primarily provided technical support.

2.2 Implementation

As mentioned, the LAP was launched in October 2003 as a five-year operation scheduled to
close in June 2008, but it was then extended twice (to December 2010 and June 2011). Although
the donors had agreed to finance specific components and subcomponents, flows of funds did not
commence at the same time, as indicated in Table 1.

Implementation faltered during the first two years. Weak capacity to facilitate and execute
project activities, develop terms of reference and bidding documents, and supervise and monitor
procurement delayed procurement and slowed disbursement. These problems were compounded
by poor coordination and cooperation among the numerous implementing agencies. For example,
the CIDA grant became effective only in 2008; DFID set up separate institutional arrangements;
and GTZ and NDF provided technical assistance and did not report directly to the project office.
The Mid-term Review of 2006 documented the seriousness of these gaps and proposed
measures—primarily a restructuring of the project—to address them.

The LAP was restructured in October 2008 and, as explained, the PDO was altered to reflect a
shift in focus from delivering a functioning land administration system to laying the foundation
for such a system. The former objective was unattainable within five years. As a result,
implementation shifted to ensuring that (i) the legal and institutional frameworks were in place to
buttress a well-functioning land administration system and (ii) the eight pilot activities
(systematic titling, customary land demarcation, geodetic reference network, a land valuation
database, and so forth) were testing best practices to determine if they could be scaled up in a
subsequent project. Performance indicators and project components had been amended to reflect
changes to the PDO. The closing date was extended by two years and funds reallocated to meet




                                                8
the project’s revised demands. A small grants program was added to expand civil society
participation in the project.

Following the Mid-term Review, the project provided targeted institutional strengthening and
capacity building support to the various implementing agencies and key stakeholders in areas
vital to improving implementation, such as project management, communication, participatory
M&E, procurement, and financial management. The supervision dialogue with the Government
of Ghana intensified, resulting in a more focused approach by the Borrower to implementation
and the resolution of risks and constraints. These efforts, together with the restructuring,
significantly improved the implementation of several parts of the project and the realization of
key intermediate outcomes. Eventually, the project was able to:
    • Draft Lands and Land-Use and Planning Bills.
    • Ascertain customary rights in 20 pilot districts.
    • Continue reforms based on the consolidation of four land agencies into one entity through
        the Lands Commission Act 767 (2008), which Parliament enacted on October 29, 2008.
    • Decentralize the deeds registry to all nine regional capitals and bring the registration of
        deeds closer to clients.
    • Establish CLSs in 36 traditional authority jurisdictions.
    • Reduce the backlog of land cases in Accra’s courts with the automation of five land
        courts in Accra.
    • Complete the inventory of State-acquired land in 43 districts.
    • Complete the revaluation of properties.
    • Complete the first phase of the geodetic reference network, covering the “Golden
        Triangle? of Accra, Kumasi, and Takoradi.
    • Complete the first phase of the land information system.
    • Complete the first phase of the intelligence scanning of land records.
    • Complete the communication and gender strategies.
    • Complete the spatial frameworks and local community plans.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization

The project established an M&E Unit, which initially attempted to maintain a link with MLNR’s
Project Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation Department. This arrangement could not be
sustained, because the LAP monitoring framework was adjusted to reflect a results-based
orientation. The M&E Unit was then principally involved with collecting data and reporting on
the short list of key indicators identified in the monitoring framework.

Those indicators were not always completely and accurately tracked, however, largely because
the M&E functional structures were not appropriate. The LAP had an undeniably broad scope. It
was undertaken in a complex institutional, regulatory, and social environment and suffered from
a lack of capacity, given that only two staff persons were assigned to M&E. That the M&E
system furnished its deliverables under such constraints is worthy of praise. Even so, the
elaborate framework proposed in the revised M&E plan could not be made operational, not only
because of the limitations on capacity just mentioned, but because the level of commitment to
high-quality M&E waned in the high-paced activity that characterized the LAP after
restructuring.


                                               9
In conclusion, the role of M&E should have been more vibrant and relevant to the reforms and to
the project’s performance. Although resources were limited and regions were not fully engaged,
it appears that the importance of M&E for change management was underestimated.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project complied fully with environmental, social, and fiduciary safeguards. Specific
activities and issues are discussed in the following sections.

Environmental and social safeguards
The project triggered the Bank’s safeguard policies for environmental assessments (OP 4.01) and
involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12). It received a Category B classification, because its potential
environmental and social impacts were considered to be localized, reversible, and manageable. A
Resettlement Policy Framework and an Environmental and Social Management Framework were
prepared and disclosed prior to project appraisal, and the project was designed to ensure
compliance with these safeguard policies. The project designated and trained staff to monitor
environmental and social safeguards.

The pilot demarcation of allodial boundaries and systematic land titling involved no areas of
potential environmental significance. The demarcation of customary boundaries resulted in no
loss of livelihood, access, or assets. The project made institutional arrangements and maintained
cordial professional relationships with the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure
compliance with the agency’s guidelines. Disagreements on a couple of boundaries in one region
were resolved amicably through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms established as part of
the LAP's activities.

During implementation the civil works program changed, causing only the head office building
for the national Lands Commission to be funded under the KfW contribution. MLNR owned the
site earmarked for that building, but people with no legal right to the land occupied it, using it
mainly for their livelihoods. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment with a
Management Plan and an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan were developed by the project
and reviewed and cleared by the World Bank for in-country disclosure. In-country disclosure and
implementation were not initiated because there is a hold on the civil works.

With respect to other social issues, a gender strategy for land administration that covered all
aspects of project activities was developed in 2009, along with an action plan and
implementation strategy. The preparation involved extensive stakeholder consultations and
validation and consultative workshops on the draft at national, district, and institutional levels.
The strategy is incorporated into project activities for implementation under LAP2. The project
conducted a number of gender-based training activities for participating agency staff, and it
identified gender focal persons to respond to gender issues from their agencies and report them
to the project.




                                                10
The project encouraged engagement with civil society. It supported establishment of an umbrella
organization on land—the Coalition of Civil Society Organizations on Land—which is now well
established as a premier organization working on land issues in Ghana. A special small grants
program was developed and managed by an independent body to ensure that civil society could
identify and undertake specific activities related to land issues, based on the submission and
approval of proposals. These activities included community entry, sensitization and education,
governance issues, capacity building, M&E, and advocacy for land issues and the project in
particular. Some of the gender-related activities also fell under this civil society initiative. The
Coalition of Civil Society Organizations on Land was also represented in project implementation
support missions and technical subcommittees.

Fiduciary
No fiduciary issues impeded the project’s implementation. The project complied with its
fiduciary requirements in general and submitted its financial reports and annual audits on time.
The 2009 audited financial statements were received in August 2010, and the auditors issued an
unqualified opinion. Prior to project closure, the last Bank supervision mission reviewed the
status of all outstanding project procurement activities to ensure that all contracts for goods
would be delivered, consultancy assignments completed, and reports submitted before the
closing date of June 30, 2011. All procured goods were fully delivered, except for a contract to
procure computers and accessories, which was fulfilled in the first week of May 2011. Three
consultancy contracts were still open but virtually completed; the consultants had submitted their
draft final reports and received comments from clients.

Except for the initial years, when implementation capacity was weak, procurement was generally
smooth. The project’s administrative performance gained momentum after the 2008
restructuring.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Bank and project management conducted stakeholder consultations and documented lessons
from the LAP to inform the design of LAP2. The project served as a case study for a World Bank
review of experiences in land administration in sub-Saharan Africa, which started in 2010 and
ended in the first half of 2011. The study provided an independent analytical and evaluation
platform for reviewing the LAP experience and transferring learning to LAP2. The lessons and
experiences are also guiding the design and preparation of a proposed Commercial Agriculture
Project. The first six months of 2011 were used to close LAP and plan for LAP2; the transitional
arrangements were completed, and LAP2 became effective in July 2011. The second phase and
was launched officially in September 2011, coinciding with the ICR mission.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

As noted, the LAP was the first Bank-funded operation in Africa that was dedicated solely to
land administration. It was highly attuned to Ghana’s development agenda and the World Bank’s
CAS. The main thrust of the National Land Policy of 1999, which the LAP helped to implement,


                                                11
was to develop an efficient land management system throughout Ghana and provide transparency
and efficiency in land transactions. The project dealt with a series of constraints—a weak policy
environment, absence of up-to-date base maps, undemarcated customary (allodial) boundaries,
undefined land rights, and slow resolution of land cases in courts—that manifested as insecure
land tenure, difficult access to land for all purposes, and little recording or registration of land
transactions.

The Government of Ghana provided solid support for the project over its eight-year life span. In
the land policy context in Ghana in 2003, when the LAP was launched, it was welcomed as a
timely and highly relevant operation. The project remained highly relevant in the years that
followed, as private interest in investing in commercial agriculture grew and a global “land grab?
followed rising commodity prices in 2008. Through the project’s support for improved land
registration and resolution of land disputes, Ghana’s land markets have become more efficient,
and land administration systems have been strengthened to facilitate investment that is beneficial
to local communities. The LAP also effectively built the foundation for a follow-on operation
that would deepen and broaden land administration reforms in Ghana. For example:
    • The LAP initiated efforts to improve the land administration framework, reduce disputes
        over land rights, and speed the processes for issuing land titles and documenting land
        rights in urban and rural areas. These efforts made land tenure more secure; secure tenure
        facilitates access to credit and has the potential to promote greater investment in the
        economy.
    • The project also initiated reforms in the public sector, such as the decentralization of land
        administration, to rationalize institutional responsibilities for land administration and
        improve the delivery of (and access to) land services. The reforms contributed to
        transparent and secure land transactions, reducing transaction costs throughout Ghana,
        especially in rural and underprivileged communities, and facilitating investment and
        growth.
    • The project facilitated the participation of civil society (through the Coalition of Civil
        Society Organizations on Land) and the private sector in land management and
        administration, laying the groundwork to check excesses in public sector management,
        promote transparency, and develop self-help initiatives for growth and development.
    • At the close of the project, the government was drafting two important bills, a Land Bill
        and a Land Use and Planning Bill.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory (as measured against revised indicators)

Performance in achieving the PDO can be assessed with respect to three sets of initiatives that
the LAP promoted: institutional reforms, policy reforms, and pilot activities. The sections that
follow discuss achievements for each set of initiatives. Overall, taking into account the
assessment results for institutional reforms (highly satisfactory), policy reforms (satisfactory),
and pilot activities (marginally satisfactory), the project is rated satisfactory in achieving its
development objectives.

Institutional reforms
Rating: Highly satisfactory


                                                12
The significant structural changes in land institutions occurring over the course of the project
will underpin institutional reforms for the next 25 years, including: the integration of four core
land agencies into the NLC through passage of the Land Agency Act 2008; the opening of eight
new Deed Registration Offices, which (with the two existing offices) gives each region of the
country an office; the creation and opening of 36 CLSs at the local level for recording land
documents prior to their registration and for coordinating with district authorities and land use
planning authorities; stronger cooperation in land matters between the NLC and the Office of the
Administrator of Stool Lands and the Town and Country Planning Department; formation of the
Coalition of Civil Society Organizations on Land; and the establishment and automation of five
new land courts to adjudicate land cases. Of these institutional reforms, three major reforms were
undertaken before the project was restructured: the creation of a consolidated land agency (NLC)
through the Land Agency Act, the decentralization of deed registration, and the establishment of
one-third of the CLSs. The PDO outcome indicators for these institutional reforms and their
performance are as follows:

1. Turnaround time in registering deeds reduced to less than 1 month and for registering titles
reduced to less than 6 month – fully achieved;
2. Backlog land litigation cases lodged at High Courts and Circuit courts in all ten (10) regional
capitals decreased, and land litigation cases decreased in courts of 3 pilot areas namely Ejisu,
Wasa Akropong and Gbawe – partially achieved;
3. Land transaction revenues to local and central government increased by 130% - fully
achieved;
4. Land Agency Act passed by Parliament and operational - fully achieved;
5. Substantive Land Act passed by Parliament and operational – partially achieved.

Before project restructuring in 2008, the number of days taken to register property had already
drastically fallen from 136 days in 2005 to 34 days in 2008 6, the Land Agency (Commission)
Act was already passed by Parliament and operational, and land transaction revenues had already
increased by more than 100 percent to Ghana Ȼ 26.6 million from Ghana Ȼ 11.3 million in 2003.
Based on this assessment, the institutional reform is rated highly satisfactory.

Policy reforms
Rating: Satisfactory

Policy initiatives undertaken through the project were meant to develop a foundation for the
long-term development of an efficient land management and administration system. The majority
of the policy reform agenda was undertaken before project restructuring, and a good number of
reforms were tied to key legislation, including the Land Agency Bill, Land Bill, and the Land
Use Planning Bill.

Successful initiatives, measured in terms of the PDO outcome and intermediate outcome
indicators, included: completion of a gender strategy for land rights and land administration
(fully achieved); increasing the registration of land ownership by women (fully achieved);
development and approval of a policy on compensation for land acquired compulsorily in the
6
    See World Bank, Doing Business 2012 Report in addition to sources indicated in the Results Framework Table.


                                                        13
past (fully achieved); and completion of policy documents to support the legislative reform
agenda, including drafting of the overarching Land Bill, the Land Agency Bill, and the Land Use
Planning Bill (fully achieved).

A great deal was achieved, although intermediate outcome indicators for some policy
interventions were partially attained or missed. The Land Bill was drafted but not passed by
Parliament (partially achieved). The backlog of land cases in courts was reduced but not
eliminated (partially achieved), and the Land Information System (LIS) and reengineering of
associated business processes were designed and piloted but not rolled out (partially achieved). A
set of 4 studies on the organization, management and operation of public land agencies was
undertaken but only 2 of the 4 studies were accepted by the government (partially achieved); and
a study on the fees and charges for land administration services was not undertaken (not
achieved). Provisions have been made for LAP2 to complete and consolidate these interventions.

Of these policy reforms, the policy studies underlying the Land Agency and Land Use Planning
Bills, the policy on compensation for land acquired in the past and the development of LIS, were
completed before the project was restructured.

Based on this assessment, policy reform is rated satisfactory.

Pilot activities
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Since LAP was the first land administration project in Ghana and in Africa, the various
technologies under the project were unproven in the Ghana environment. In light of this, project
design provided for the testing of some key technologies before rolling them out. Accordingly,
six pilot activities were implemented primarily to customize the technologies to the Ghana
environment and to document the process for scaling up in future phases if warranted. Of the six
pilots, four achieved the intermediate outcome targets: the State Land Inventory was completed,
including land surveys, valuation, and development of a compensation policy; CLSs were
established and strengthened to administer traditional lands; land valuation was undertaken for
tax assessment and collection; and land use planning models were established. The two pilots
that partially achieved their intermediate outcome targets were systematic land titling and
customary boundary demarcation, but lessons drawn from these experiences were used in
designing LAP2. These two pilots, together with the land use planning pilot, were implemented
largely after restructuring, whereas the other three had a head start. Based on this assessment, the
pilot activities are rated moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Economically and financially sound

Ex ante cost-benefit analysis and financial analysis were undertaken to derive economic and
financial rates of return for the LAP during appraisal. Similar analyses could not be undertaken
for this ICR, however, because the outputs used in the original analyses were no longer
applicable after restructuring. Even so, based on international experience and cost-effectiveness
analysis, the project’s investments appear to have been economically and financially sound. The



                                                14
key initiatives that were piloted and the policy and institutional reforms that were instituted
generated at least three sets of benefits. First, they improved the security of land tenure. Second,
they improved efficiency in registration systems and service delivery by decentralizing deed
registries to the regional level and by establishing and strengthening CLSs (in fact, the time to
register deeds and titles declined substantially). Third, higher-quality land information is
provided more cheaply following the establishment of a modern geodetic reference network in
Ghana’s Golden Triangle and the production of base maps in three regions.

Empirical studies undertaken internationally indicate, although not uniformly, that land tenure
security and efficiency in land transactions can contribute to a number of desirable outcomes.
They can increase the incentives for investment and productivity, as well as access to more and
cheaper credit, which lead to increased investment and productivity. They can spur an overall
increase in productivity as land moves from less efficient to more efficient producers through
rental and sales markets. Recent international studies have also demonstrated that better land
information adds considerable value to the growth of economies as measured by GDP.

A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for a subset of project activities (systematic land
titling, the geodetic reference network, customary boundary demarcation, and large-scale base
mapping) (for details, see Annex 3). The analysis, which largely consisted of comparing average
unit costs of project activities with international unit cost norms, indicated that unit costs for the
LAP activities generally were within the range of comparable international norms. In other
words, project funds appear to have been used cost effectively.

As for its fiscal impact, the LAP exceeded PDO performance targets and yielded significant
revenue for the government, some of which was retained for internal use (such as the Office of
the Administrator of Stool Lands). Revenues increased more than ten-fold, rising from US$ 12
million in October 2003 to US$ 135 million in December 2010. Land agencies contributed more
to the government’s fiscal revenue than they received from the central budget.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The moderately satisfactory rating is based on a weighted average of moderately satisfactory for
the period before the project was restructured ((2003–08) and satisfactory for the period after
that (2009–11). The weights were derived from project disbursements: SDR 7.8 million before
restructuring against SDR 7.3 million afterward.

The overall outcome rating is based on assessments of the project’s relevance (highly relevant),
achievement of the project development objectives (satisfactory) and efficiency (economically
and financially sound). As discussed, the project was highly relevant to the country’s
development agenda, including the implementation of its National Land Policy, and the World
Bank’s CAS. The LAP was and remains relevant in light of increased private investment in
commercial agriculture and the “land-grab? spurred by rising food prices in 2008. Achievement
of the PDO was rated satisfactory (as measured against the revised performance indicators)
based on an assessment of its three constituents: institutional reforms (highly satisfactory), policy
reforms (satisfactory); and pilot activities (moderately satisfactory). As for efficiency, a



                                                 15
qualitative economic assessment based on international experience found that the project’s
investments in policy and institutional reforms and pilot initiatives were economically sound and
that the fiscal impact was considerable: Revenues rose more than ten-fold, and land agencies
contributed more to the government’s fiscal revenue than they received from the central budget.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development
The lack of easy access to land and insecurity of land tenure have hindered investment in land
and hence constrained Ghana’s economic growth and development. The country’s growth and
poverty reduction strategies (GPRS I and II) explicitly recognize that GPRS objectives can be
achieved only if land issues are dealt with effectively.

Despite inadequate data and analysis, anecdotal and other evidence indicates that the LAP helped
lay the foundation to achieve Ghana’s middle-income status as envisioned in GPRS II,
particularly through:
    • An improved land administration framework, which will reduce disputes over land rights
        and speed procedures for issuing land titles and documenting land rights in urban and
        rural areas.
    • Reforms in public land management structures, which helped pave the way to
        decentralize land administration and rationalize institutional responsibilities for land
        administration.
    • Greater participation of civil society and the private sector, which can help to check the
        excesses of public sector management, promote transparency, and foster self-help
        initiatives for growth and development.
    • More orderly urban development (through interventions by the Town and Country
        Planning Department) and enhanced revenue generation by local administrations and
        councils, which could expand and enhance their services to local populations.

The project also raised women’s participation in land registration and titling, surpassing the PDO
performance indicator target. The gender strategy developed through the project included a key
proposal for sustained advocacy for registering women’s land rights, particularly in rural
communities. The project raised awareness of the gender strategy’s content in the land agencies
and civil society organizations and among selected staff of the Ministry of Women and
Children’s Affairs, members of women’s groups, and traditional authorities. The project also
addressed the limited capacity of stakeholders to implement the strategy: It developed a training
manual to strengthen capacity for implementation and also completed the development of gender
support guidelines for land agencies.

Institutional change/strengthening
The project’s ambitious institutional reform agenda supported the creation of a single land
agency, decentralization of deed registries to the regional level, establishment of secretariats
(CLSs) to administer traditional lands, and the development of one-stop shops for service
delivery. These reforms are uncommon anywhere and are certainly the first of their kind in sub-
Saharan Africa.




                                               16
Land management and administration previously were fragmented under six land agencies
overseen by MLNR. The Land Agency Act of 2008, the subsequent creation of the NLC, and the
integration of four departments under the NLC represent an impressive, significant stride toward
institution building and sustainable land management in Ghana. Of the six original land agencies,
the NLC excludes only the Office of the Administrator of Stool Lands and the Town and
Country Planning Department, which by their very nature cannot be brought under the NLC.
These reforms will have positive, long-term effects in the land sector and enable Ghana to
institute a single-agency model (versus separate cadastre and registry functions) in land
administration.

Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)
Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Findings from the beneficiary surveys conducted under the project can be summarized as
follows:
    • Some 70 percent of respondents indicated that the deed registration process was
       achieving its objectives.
    • About 75 percent of respondents indicated that the establishment of the registries had a
       positive impact on the delivery of land registration services.
    • Applicants for deeds stated that the average time for completing registration had
       improved.
    • The registration of land has enabled about one-fourth of all applicants to access various
       forms of loans from financial institutions. Respondents also used their documents to
       secure tenure, building permits, and visas and to post bail.
    • The deed registry offices empowered women and increased revenues to land agencies.

Focus group discussions also elicited important information. The costs associated with the
surveying service were regarded as high, and legal practitioners claimed that service delivery
was inefficient. Staff of financial institutions, on the other hand, reported that their contact with
the registration service as well as the accessibility of the service and quality of information were
of the “highest? level of satisfaction. Members of traditional authorities and the regional houses
of chiefs underlined the usefulness of the registration service by rating it “high? but considered
the time involved to be long.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

The overall project risk to outcome and sustainability is rated low, given the high level of
successive governments’ commitment and cooperation, acceptance of the reforms by all
stakeholders (including the land agencies), and the project management capacity built over the
years. More specifically:
    • Political risk to development outcome is rated low. Successive governments have
       remained loyal to the 1999 National Land Policy and continued supporting the LAP.



                                                 17
       Traditional authorities and land agency officers have been generally receptive to
       institutional and procedural changes and other reforms.
   •   Technological risk to development outcome is rated moderate. The project has had
       relative success in adopting and disseminating the use of some types of cadastre-related
       technology (such as digital plane tables), yet the risk remains that using more advanced
       technology—information and communication equipment and infrastructure as well as
       applications for land administration, the LIS, and geodetic reference communications, for
       example—may pose a challenge in the LAP’s future endeavors. The capacity-building
       program envisaged under LAP2 should help to mitigate this risk.
   •   The economic and financial risk to development outcome is rated low. The central
       government’s contributions to the operation of the NLC and other land agencies has been
       consistent, although such contributions were lower than planned for LAP’s counterpart
       funding needs. The NLC now generates more revenue for the government than public
       funds it actually spends. A risk mitigation strategy will eventually involve a review of
       cost-recovery measures and an assessment of how much internally generated revenue the
       land agencies can access. The required studies and reforms are included under LAP2.
   •   The institutional risk to development outcome is rated low. The institutional development
       of the project has been substantial. Creation of a single land administration agency was a
       big step. Full integration of the individual departments as functional divisions within the
       NLC was delayed by the Organization, Management, and Operations (OMO) studies,
       which will be completed under LAP2.
   •   Environmental risks to development outcome are low. The environmental and social
       assessment undertaken at appraisal classified the project as a Category B project. Two
       safeguard policies were triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Involuntary
       Resettlement (OP 4.12). During implementation, the minimal safeguard issues that arose
       were addressed effectively. Therefore the risk to development outcome is negligible, with
       the exception of risks involved in customary boundary demarcation.
   •   Social risk to development outcome is rated low. The project has maintained good
       visibility and stature, and the newly created NLC has overcome most of the negative
       perceptions inherited from its predecessors. The project’s public awareness campaigns
       have greatly reduced suspicion about the intentions of the government as the major actor
       in land administration.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

On the positive side, the Bank provided adequate resources and support from identification
through approval. The strategic relevance and approach adopted by the Bank were sound and
well timed. Poverty, gender, and social development considerations were reflected well in the
design. The project had no environmental concerns to start with, and it was well prepared to
comply with fiduciary requirements. The implementation arrangements were basically sound for



                                               18
a first-phase operation. Sufficient time and attention were paid to the design of M&E
arrangements.

On the negative side, the Bank failed at the Decision Meeting to adjust the initial PDO for the
APL to make it more realistic for a SIL 7; it also failed to guard sufficiently against project
complexity.

Quality of supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank maintained a high-caliber but small team of specialists as its core supervision staff,
occasionally adding other specialties as needed. All supervision missions were carried out jointly
with the donors. The Mid-term Review Mission was a very large one, as warranted by the
importance of the issues tabled during the mission. The project restructuring decision was jointly
and transparently taken during this mission. The Bank’s focus on development has been steadily
maintained, and mission members emphasized this very aspect in all exchanges with the
government and project staff. The quality of supervision was aided further by the
Implementation Support Mission documentation, which was very extensive and useful. The
reporting clearly was candid, and supervision missions always chose to reveal and confront
problems, as seen in a review of the project’s Implementation Status and Results Reports and
Aide Memoires. Project audits did not report any irregularities. Finally, the transition
arrangements for project closure and preparations for the next phase took place expeditiously and
smoothly.

One shortcoming on the part of the Bank was that although restructuring was recommended in
2006 by the Mid-term Review, there was a two-year delay in preparing and approving the formal
restructuring. Thus the necessary remedy was taken only at the end of 2008.

Justification of rating for overall Bank performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The rating of moderately satisfactory is a result of the Bank’s moderately unsatisfactory
performance in quality at entry and its satisfactory quality of supervision, while taking into
account the overall moderately satisfactory outcome rating for the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Arriving on the heels of the newly completed and widely accepted National Land Policy, the
LAP was well received by Ghanaian society and received enormous private and public attention
during its preparation and design. Owing to its timeliness and the interest displayed by the major
beneficiaries, the project probably received more domestic press coverage than other concurrent

Minutes of the Decision Meeting.


                                                     19
interventions. The project was avidly supported by successive governments; no instances of
apathy or indifference were reported. Project-sponsored meetings were attended regularly by
representatives of land agencies and other interested government parties during preparation and
implementation. The project actively promoted participatory processes, and evidence of
stakeholder involvement during preparation is available.

The government maintained its high level of commitment and sense of ownership for the project,
starting with project identification and moving through implementation and completion. The
government facilitated project-related meetings, met all of the effectiveness conditions on a
timely basis, and facilitated the project’s launch. During project implementation, the government
maintained good working relationships with the Bank team, the development partners, and
LAPU staff, and it supported the organization of all supervision missions. The government
allowed LAPU to play its coordinating role effectively and ensure that agreed actions were
implemented after every supervision mission.

The government failed to release counterpart funds regularly and consistently, however. At
project closure, counterpart contribution to the project by the government remained at 36 percent
of the original allocation. This shortcoming particularly affected regions where funding was
scarce. The scarcity and delay in the release of counterpart funds impeded the implementation of
some subprojects at the district and community levels.

Implementing agency or agencies performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Despite the vast scope of the project, the implementing agency (originally the Ministry of Lands
and Forestry and currently MLNR) made significant progress in mounting and establishing a
brand-new agency, the NLC. Intra-agency conflicts were minimized and procedures streamlined.
Staff members’ dedication and quality show obvious improvements. The new NLC is committed
to achieving project objectives while recognizing the great challenges involved in bringing
efficiency and order to a long-neglected sector.

Outside the NLC proper, the Office of the Administrator of Stool Lands and the Town and
Country Planning Department have done very well and cooperated closely with the core project.
These two agencies have good, motivated personnel who have implemented their respective
functions adequately. Both the NLC and other land agencies recorded good progress in
beneficiary and stakeholder consultations.

As discussed, however, M&E suffered despite the project’s well-designed M&E system. LAPU
supplied inadequate M&E input and analyses to project management and the general public.

The LAP was often mentioned as working in isolation from the main operational structures of its
parent ministry, MLNR. Regional staff criticized the NLC for being too centralized and
preoccupied with what happened in Accra. Consultants recruited by the head office to work in
the regions were supervised poorly and did not leave much of a mark on the organization in
terms of transferred skills and knowhow.




                                               20
At the government’s request, KfW decided to reallocate € 3 million of its project funding toward
the construction of a € 6 million building to house the headquarters of the NLC, but the status of
construction was unsatisfactory. The government had delayed in reaching a consensus internally
and with KfW on the building’s size and design. At the time of this ICR, while KfW’s financial
commitment remained unchanged at € 3 million, the cost of the modified building design
proposed by the government was estimated at € 10 million, greater than the available financing.

Another area of weakness was the coordination of national land agencies on the one hand and
coordination between national and local agencies on the other. The government’s performance in
coordinating the six cofinanciers was inadequate.

Justification of rating for overall borrower performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

Given the issues raised in the previous sections, the rating for overall government performance is
moderately satisfactory, primarily as a result of satisfactory performance on the part of the
government and implementing agencies, tempered by shortcomings in release of counterpart
funds and inadequate coordination.

6. Lessons Learned
Two broad categories of lessons emerge from LAP. The first consists of lessons of broad
significance for future projects and government programs. The second consists of lessons
specific to initiatives piloted under the LAP.

Lessons with general operational implications
Land administration reforms are long-term interventions and should be conceived and planned
as such. The key activities supported under LAP, ranging from merging and streamlining land
agencies, systematic land titling and demarcation of customary boundaries to developing systems
for resolving land conflicts, were merely laying the basis for a longer term engagement in
reforming land administration. The success and sustainability of land reforms require a longer-
term perspective and support from development partners and other social actors to help the
government overcome social and political inertia. Since the restructuring of the LAP and
launching of LAP2, a longer-term perspective has been the key guide to planning and
implementation.

Anchor long-term land administration and management programs in sound land policies and
laws and tested technologies. The restructured project focused on developing a sound policy and
technology foundation, which will be consolidated under LAP2.

Tailor the level of project complexity to implementation capacity and duration of the project.
Doing so in the design of LAP would have avoided restructuring and shortened its
implementation period. When it becomes clear that the likelihood of achieving a project’s
development objectives is slim, corrective action should be taken promptly through restructuring.

In conceptualizing, designing, and implementing the project, keep expectations modest. The
validity of assumptions on land administration reforms based on experiences in other countries
must be well tested before they can be applied to a new setting.

Do not take political and key stakeholder commitment for granted. Commitment must be
consciously built, reinforced, and sustained throughout the project, as done in the LAP and
planned for LAP2.

Given the multiplicity of stakeholders and interest groups, land administration reforms require
much broader consultation and consensus building, combined with greater awareness building,
than some other reforms. These activities should be appropriately planned and budgeted in
project design, as done in the LAP and LAP2.

Better land administration services are provided when they are demand-driven and delivered
through a decentralized system that brings services closer to clients. These arrangements reduce
the cost of services to citizens and improve the public image of the service organization. In LAP,
decentralization of deeds registration contributed to a drastic reduction in the number of days
taken to register property. LAP2 addresses this lesson by giving greater emphasis to
decentralization and service orientation.


                                               22
An effective M&E system and program take considerable resources and time to develop. Even
with two full-time staff and reasonable support, the M&E arrangements for the LAP did not meet
expectations. More support is provided under LAP2; each region will have a dedicated M&E
staff member employed by the NLC.

Donor commitment to long-term programs of land management and administration is essential
to their success. The success of land projects and programs depends on long-term commitment,
including a commitment to avoid the premature termination of disbursements.

Lessons of a specific nature, related to initiatives piloted under the LAP
The lessons specific to the LAP may be summarized as follows:
   • Practical and innovative approaches are required to develop methodologies for key pilots
       if they are to provide a framework for scaling up. Under LAP, the technologies tested in
       the 6 pilots had been used successfully elsewhere in Africa but could not automatically
       work in Ghana as they required deliberate customization to fit the Ghana environment.
       For example, tropical thick forests made it difficult for ground methods of surveying
       which required bush clearance to precede the exercise. Similarly, tropical weather which
       causes thick and low cloud cover reduced considerably the number of days in a year
       aerial during which photography and satellite imagery could be obtained.
   • Pilots require continuous and close M&E to stay on course and ensure timely lessons.
       This was necessary for the 6 pilots under LAP and had not been adequately prepared for.
   • Systematic land titling cannot be done successfully without merging the processes of land
       adjudication, surveying, and registration to save costs and enhance transparency. Under
       LAP, this required formation of teams of people from different government
       organizational units to work with consultants and this proved difficult.
   • An open, competitive bidding process with adequate technical specifications is required
       to select alternative and competing technologies. This had not been adequately taken into
       account in the design of LAP, and its absence made it difficult in making choices
       between aerial photography and satellite imagery to produce base maps for the project.
       LAP2 has taken up this lesson in its design.
   • Decentralization under LAP was a successful strategy for improving land document
       recording and registration services, and it was demonstrated that cooperation between the
       government land agencies and the traditional authorities is necessary and possible for
       improved land management. This strategy is being reinforced under LAP2.
   • Successful organizational restructuring requires immediate implementation after passing
       the necessary laws, and it should be backed by adequate political and financial support.
       After enacting the Land Commissions Act under LAP, there was great uncertainty and a
       reduction in morale among staff in the land agencies that were targeted for merger under
       the new law. These were abated with implementation of the low but it was uneven due to
       inadequate resources especially for putting up new buildings to enable operation of one-
       stop shop concepts and co-location of staff from different land agencies.
   • Systematic introduction of gender focused strategy has potential for enhancing gender
       issues in Land Administration.




                                              23
   •   Institutional support for gender mainstreaming in land administration is dependent on
       effective sensitization of key personnel of Land Sector Agencies.

Legal and institutional framework. The starting point for the reforms was the 1999 National
Land Policy. Three bills were slated for preparation and passage during the life of the LAP: the
Land Bill, the Land-Use and Planning Bill, and the Land Commission Bill. The Land
Commission Act 767 was passed in October 2008 and received presidential assent in December
2008 to merge four land agencies into a single entity, the NLC. The other two bills remain in
draft form; the Land Use Planning Bill is at a more advanced stage of preparation.

Registration of customary freehold. A draft discussion paper on registering customary freehold,
including a model registration instrument, was prepared on the basis of the Attorney General’s
legal opinion concerning the legal status of this tenure category. It was decided to address this
issue in the Land Bill, however.

Establishment of land courts. Support to the judiciary in the establishment of five automated land
courts in Accra was well received. These courts deal only with land cases, and their
establishment reduced the backlog of cases by 88 percent. The LAP commissioned an evaluation
of the performance of Land Courts by a former Supreme Court justice. The resulting report
concluded that procedural shortcomings delayed the processing of cases and blunted the project’s
efficiency initiatives. Provisions have been made to address those shortcomings in LAP2.

Inventory of compulsorily acquired land. This activity included the identification, surveying, and
valuation of State-acquired land to produce a database of State land assets. The database was
used to produce a new policy specifying (i) the basis for compensation for land compulsorily
acquired in the past and (ii) a process for deciding which State lands should be retained and
which returned to the original owners or sold. The project was successful and largely achieved
performance targets for the inventory and for developing a policy.

Policy studies. Several policy studies and one strategy were undertaken: a study of the divestiture
of vested lands; a gender strategy for land rights and land administration; and a study of land
rights and vulnerability in two pilot CLS areas (Kete Krachi and Dormaa Ahenkro). The study on
the divestiture of vested lands was completed and used to develop a policy currently under
implementation. The gender strategy was also completed and will be implemented under LAP2.
The land rights and vulnerability study detailed land rights in the communities as well as the
security of tenure and vulnerability related to each land right. It provided useful insights into the
customary land tenure systems in these communities and actions to protect the rights of the

CLS programs under LAP2. One study was not undertaken: it was a Finance and Fee Structure
study, which is planned to be undertaken under LAP2.

Strengthening customary land administration. The LAP accelerated the opening of CLS offices
under the traditional authorities to provide focused land services to authorities and local people.
Tangible services being provided include the recording of lease agreements, and upon request the
CLS assists in preparing applications for deed registration. An important function will be to
cooperate with the Local Authorities on town planning. This activity was successful: The target
of 30 CLS offices was exceeded, with 36 new offices opened under the LAP.

Restructuring, decentralizing, and building capacity in land agencies. In establishing a solid
platform for the expected 25-year reform in the land sector, this output was critical to the
project’s outcome. The Lands Commission Act was passed in 2008 and implemented by
consolidating four land agencies into one, the NLC. A key study to support the act’s
implementation—the OMO) study—was not undertaken successfully. It started late, and only
two of four components were accepted: (1) the analysis of current business processes and
proposals to streamline within a single workflow and (2) the Human Resource and Capacity
Building Study to identify and quantify needs for new skills in the public and private sectors as a
result of the LAP. The rejected components were: (3) Financial and Cost studies to calculate
financial needs and opportunity costs for the institution, treasury, and clients of reform (under
several scenarios) and (4) the Capacity Development Plan for Public Academic and Private

Sector Institutions to include a strategic plan and detail planning needs and availability of
training at all levels. The rejected studies will be redone under LAP2.

Strengthening training and education institutions and the private sector. The project provided
some in-service training to the private sector and logistical support (new equipment and
technology) to facilitate the title registration exercise. It also provided equipment and books to
Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology to enhance teaching; some university
staff participated in conducting studies for the project.

Small grants to facilitate civil society participation. The special grant created to facilitate the
involvement of civil society in the reforms funded eight proposals. The majority of proposals (63
percent) were related to Education and Awareness Creation; 21 percent focused on capacity
building; and 16 percent related to gender and advocacy.

Base mapping. Base mapping was undertaken in pilot areas for title registration and the
development of structural and local plans. The resulting maps covered almost all of the area
planned (15,000 square kilometers) at scales of 1:2,500 and 1:5,000. The cost of the LAP
orthophoto maps, including the aerial photography, with contours at a scale of 1:2,500, was
about US$ 150 per square kilometer. Costs for a comparable product in Europe would be US$
30–50 per square kilometer, but project costs were within the range of average unit production
costs in sub-Saharan Africa, where survey planes have to be mobilized from Europe and tropical
weather creates cloud cover most of the year. Satellite imagery was also purchased at about US$
35 per square kilometer to produce orthophoto maps without contour lines for land use planning.

Mapping projection. Before the LAP started, the standard map projection was the Ghana
Transverse Mercator Projection; for the LAP, a Universal Transverse Mercator Projection was



                                                      35
adopted. The coordinates of the two systems do not match. A decision on which system will
ultimately be adopted will be taken after the study for the mapping policy is done under LAP2.

Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORSs). Three CORS base stations were
established to support field survey teams using GPS equipment as pilots. The stations did not
operate 24/7 due to power outages. Some 42 additional stations would be needed to cover the
country and are planned under LAP2. The biggest challenge reported by users was the difficulty
of maintaining continuous radio contact with the CORSs. The alternative of post processing by
downloading from the Internet was limited by insufficient provision made for continuous access
to an Internet server. In many cases in Kumasi, private contractors used their own base stations
in post process mode. Any national system would need to be managed by the private sector
under contract to the government as planned under LAP2.

Developing the Cadastre and Land Information Systems (LIS). The LIS was targeted to be
operational and linked to the national framework by the end of the project. The first stage of the
LIS (design and piloting) was completed, but stage 2 (rolling out the LIS) was not done, as it
took some time for the government and the LIS consultant to agree on the software that was
developed. The third phase, namely data capture (intelligent scanning), was done for only part of
the land records. The scanning of deeds and related documents was almost completed by the end
of the LAP, but the system for accessing the records was not yet deployed in the work areas of
the Land Registration Division or integrated with the LIS. Business process reengineering was
conducted with some success, as shown in faster turnaround times for deed registration. LAP2
plans to support further scanning of land records and complete the development and rollout of
the LIS. It will do so in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization, which is
piloting an open-source software approach.

Improving deed and title registration. Prior to the project, Ghana had just one land deed registry
(in Kumasi) and two land title registries. The LAP helped to open eight deed registries in
regional centers. This major step toward the broad objective of a strong, country-wide land
administration system makes it far more convenient for citizens and businesses to register land
transactions. Clients no longer travel to Accra but to regional offices; aside from the reduction in
travel time and expense, the more reasonable volume of transactions has reduced the time needed
to complete the registration process. The CLSs created under the project act as a “front desk? to
Deed Registration Offices, increasing the flow of applications to them.

Land use planning and management. Good capacity was established and, most important, a
sound planning framework was designed and demonstrated with full documentation. The town
planning department was pleased with the assistance it received under the LAP, including long-
term technical assistance, which was very effective. Six districts in five regions were
successfully completed. Planning was done using satellite imagery.

Establishing a land valuation database. The project helped produce property valuations covering
12 districts targeted after the restructuring. A total of 45,532 properties were covered during the
revaluation

Piloting demarcation and registration of allodial (customary) land boundaries. Until the LAP
was implemented, the boundaries of customary land had not been identified. The project
undertook land surveys by contract to fix and register boundaries in 10 areas. By the end of the
project, two areas had been completed and eight were in progress.

Piloting systematic land titling and registration. The original land titling initiative planned to
complete titling for 300,000 parcels, but when the project was restructured, the initiative was
piloted instead. When the project closed, piloting had been completed, together with the
surveying of 10,860 land parcels and the approval of 5,760 parcel plans.

Project coordination and communication. The LAP was always going to be an enormous
challenge to coordinate, because it had six donors, many land agencies, activities in many parts
of the country, a broad range of other stakeholders (the private sector, civil society, academia,
and the like) with high expectations of involvement, heads of agencies spread across many
locations in Accra, and government staff with regular tasks to perform aside from the project.
The fact that even the staff and head of LAPU were not in the same office made coordination
most difficult. LAPU resources were very modest for such a complex project, and the staff
worked under great pressure. In 2005 the project was rated unsatisfactory, with major concerns
related to project management, procurement, disbursement, and M&E. There is no doubt that the
project was turned around after the Mid-term Review; better coordination and direction were

important to achieving that improvement. A communication strategy was completed by the end
of the project.

Human resources development. About two-thirds of the training targets were achieved. The
training program was not completed, partly because of the unsuccessful outcome of the OMO
consultancy.

Monitoring and evaluation. The M&E staff had a difficult task, given the project’s complexity.
The MASDAR Report (June 2011) addressed the limitations of the M&E system, including its
resource limitations and centralized nature. After the Mid-term Review, improvements were
made to the M&E system and its implementation, and 30 progress reports were produced.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Ex ante cost-benefit analysis and financial analysis were undertaken to derive economic and
financial rates of return during appraisal for the LAP. Similar analyses could not be undertaken
for the ICR, because the project outputs on which they were based were no longer applicable
after restructuring, when the project’s emphasis changed to policy and institutional reforms and
pilots. Nevertheless, based on international experience and cost-effectiveness analysis, it can be
concluded that the project’s investments were economically and financially sound. The pilots
and reforms are likely to have generated at least three sets of benefits. First, they improved land
tenure security. Second, they improved the efficiency of registration systems and service delivery
by decentralizing deed registries and establishing and strengthening CLSs (with a consequent
reduction in time to register deeds from more than 36 months to about 2 months. Third, the
project provided better quality and cheaper land information by establishing a modern geodetic
reference network in Ghana’s Golden Triangle and producing base maps for three regions.

Empirical studies undertaken internationally indicate (although not uniformly) that land tenure
security and efficiency in land transactions can increase the incentives for investment and
productivity, increase access to more and cheaper credit (which in turn increases investment and
productivity), and increase overall productivity as land moves from less efficient to more
efficient producers through rental and sales markets. In addition, recent international studies
demonstrated that land information added considerable value to the growth of economies, as
measured by GDP.

A cost-effectiveness analysis examined four LAP activities: customary boundary demarcation,
large-scale base mapping, CORS (for the geodetic reference network), and systematic land
titling. The unit costs were comparable to international standards. The results are captured in
Tables 1–4.

As for its fiscal impact, the LAP exceeded PDO performance targets and yielded significant
revenue for the government, some of which was retained for internal use (by the Office of the
Administrator of Stool Lands, for example). Revenues increased dramatically from US$ 12
million in October 2003 to US$ 135 million in December 2010, representing a more than ten-
fold increase.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
In November 2008, the project engaged a consultant to undertake a beneficiary assessment of the
Deed Registration Offices implemented by LAPU. 8 The study’s specific objectives were to:
    • Determine the total cost and time of doing business at the deed offices (including
      transportation, accommodation, meals, and incidental costs such as agent’s fees).
    • Determine the processes at the Lands Commission and Land Valuation Board that lead to
      registration.
    • Determine the number of deeds registered by each office, disaggregated by gender.
    • Ascertain whether land registration has enabled beneficiaries to obtain loans or
      mortgages from financial institutions.
    • Assess the revenue generated by land registration services.
    • Assess beneficiaries’ satisfaction with the delivery of land registration services.

Cost and time of doing business and registration processes at deed offices
In addition to the official fees for registering land, transport costs accounted for over 42 percent
of applicants’ incidental costs, followed by agents’ fees and meals.

The number one mode of ownership is family land, followed by private and stool land. The
precise and formal process developed for registering specific types of land enables registry
officials to state categorically how long the process for registering a particular type of land will
take. Because registration offices can issue definite “turnaround times? for all categories of
transactions, the time associated with specific registration processes can be monitored and
evaluated effectively.

The applicants themselves stated that the average time for completing registration had improved.
It was easier for all parties concerned to discern that the time involved in the registration process
was decreasing.

Ancillary benefits (credits, loans) facilitated by land registration
About one-fourth of all applicants used their proof of registered land to access various loans
from financial institutions. They also used their documents to secure tenure, building permits,
and visas and to post bail.

Revenue
The establishment of the deed registry offices increased the revenue-earning capacity of land
agencies, especially those directly involved in registration. Since the revenue stream is linked
directly to the number of registrations made, over time there is a clear appreciation of the
earnings accruing to each organization from its role within the registration process.

Beneficiary satisfaction
A list of 12 items was used to assess whether the land registry service was achieving its
objectives. Only 3 items (usefulness of the end product, tenure security, and a well-functioning
service) were scored “high? by over half of the respondents. Eight items were scored “medium?
by most respondents, whereas about one-third of applicants rated         decentralization in the
delivery process as “low.?

More specifically, some 70 percent of respondents indicated that the deed registration process
was achieving its objectives; 75 percent indicated that the establishment of the registries has had
a positive impact on the delivery of land registration services.

In addition to gathering information through the formal survey, the survey team gathered
information from interviews with focus groups and key informants. Surveyors scored only the
costs associated with the service as “high.? For estate developers and land agents, all items
received a score of “low? satisfaction. Legal practitioners indicated that the usefulness of the end
product is “high,? but the efficiency of the service is “low.? Perhaps unsurprisingly, staff of the
financial institutions considered the time involved with the service, as well as the accessibility of
the service and quality of information provided, to be of the “highest? satisfaction level.
Traditional authorities and members of the regional houses of chiefs underlined the usefulness of
the end product and rated it “high,? but they considered the time involved as “low? and all other
factors as “medium.? Apart from cost, which they rated “medium,? members of women's
organizations interviewed rated all elements as providing very “low? satisfaction.

With respect to the delivery of land registration services, “usefulness of the final product? was
the only measure of satisfaction scored “high? by over half of respondents One-third of
respondents expressed “low satisfaction? with the time needed to complete the process, the fees
charged by the registry offices, and the number of processes and agencies involved.

The survey respondents also observed that the deed registry offices had positively influenced
their ability to access credit and own property, empowered women, and increased revenues for
land agencies.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR9
The concluding chapter of the borrower’s ICR indicates that a major feature of the LAP was to
provide an enabling environment for exploration, testing, and learning by carrying out key land
reforms. Consequently, project activities focused on three areas:
    • Transforming the policy and legal environment governing land administration.
    • Undertaking institutional reforms.
    • Carrying out pilots of land administration measures and tools previously untested in
       Ghana, such as customary boundary demarcation, developing a geodetic reference
       network, computerizing land records, developing a Land Information System, systematic
       land titling, establishing land courts, and introducing alternative dispute resolution
       mechanisms in the adjudication of land cases. Other pilots are ascertaining and codifying
       customary laws, initiating land use planning, using Unique Parcel Numbering, building
       reference stations (CORS), developing a land valuation database, establishing and
       strengthening CLSs, and inventorying State-acquired or -occupied land.

Key achievements in pursuing project interventions under each of the four components and items
that remain to be accomplished are discussed in the sections that follow.

Component 1: Harmonizing Land Policy and Regulatory Framework for Sustainable Land
Administration
Progress has been made in evolving a responsive policy and legal environment to govern land
administration in Ghana. Two bills, the Land Bill and Land Use and Planning Bill, are at an
advanced stage of preparation. The draft bills have been the subject of stakeholder consultations
and circulated to stakeholder groups for review and comments. Following the review and
incorporation of relevant comments, the bills will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval
before presenting them to Parliament. The inventory of State-acquired land has been completed
in selected districts, enabling the government to devise a policy to determine compensation
payment where necessary. Support to the judiciary in establishing five fully automated land
courts in Accra has been very good. It is anticipated that the courts will expedite the handling of
land cases.

Component 2: Institutional Reform and Development
An institutional foundation for the second and any subsequent phases of the LAP has been laid.
The Lands Commission Act 767 was passed in October 2008 and received presidential assent in
December 2008 to merge four land agencies into a single entity, the NLC. Unfortunately no
provision was made in the budget to implement the act, creating a very difficult beginning for the
new commission. This critical issue should be taken up under LAP2. The NLC is currently
undertaking reengineering processes to ensure efficient operationalization of the Lands
Commission Act.

    Comments on the draft ICR by the implementing agency, MLNR, are contained in Annex 8.


                                                       46
Thirty-seven CLSs have been established and strengthened to facilitate management and record
keeping by traditional authorities for customary land. The CLSs, established at different periods
and places, are at different levels of growth.

Component 3: Improving Land Titling, Registration, Valuation, and Information System

Activities pursued under this component included:
   • Systematic land titling pilots in six sites in Accra and two in Kumasi, covering
        approximately 8,000 titles. About 90 percent of the sites are government lands.
   • Piloting of the LIS, which is now functional.
   • Complete installation of a geodetic reference network in Accra, Kumasi, and Takoradi;
        installation of five CORS in Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi, Tamale, and Bolgatanga is in
        progress.
   • Customary boundary demarcation in 10 sites. Unresolved disputes have seriously
        hindered progress in this activity.
   • Intelligent document scanning of land certificates. Over 200,000 documents held at the
        Accra Land Registry and some of the instruments on acquired land have been digitized.
        The system architecture has been designed to link with the LIS. The LC is to provide
        space for hosting equipment, which dedicated personnel are being trained to handle. A
        major challenge was that some deed registration records were either partially or entirely
        photocopies and had to be authenticated.
   • Support was provided to the Town and Country Planning Department for land use
        planning to enhance its legal, technological, and institutional capacity. A human
        settlement policy; institutional review; legal review; community-based land-use planning
        models; and planning guidelines, standards, and permitting procedures have been
        developed. Production of orthophoto maps and satellite imagery are yet to be completed.

Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation
A program was launched to help create awareness among stakeholders about the LAP and its
achievements. A communication strategy was completed to systematically create public
awareness on the next phase of the operation. Some capacity building was carried out in selected
areas for the land agencies to enhance their skills for effective and efficient land administration.
A gender strategy was also developed, to be implemented during the next project.

The project confronted challenges in implementing this component, however, such as a weak
commitment among some land agencies (manifested by delays in the supply and installation of
goods and equipment); setbacks in completing consultancy assignments; prolonged processing of
procurement requests; and ineffective contract management for consulting services and goods.
Despite these challenges and the complexity of the project, all the planned pilots were initiated
and have gone through continuous evaluation to elicit lessons for the next phase of the project.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Below are comments on the draft ICR from the implementing agency, MLNR.

We refer to the LAP ICR report submitted to the Government of Ghana (GoG). The report has
been reviewed and we conclude that it is an accurate reflection of the implementation process.

However, the following two main issues are to be revisited, namely: A. overall LAP rating and
B. issues on Monitoring and Evaluation.

A. OVERALL RATING OF LAP

MLNR, after having looked at the Report, have issues with the overall weighted rating given to
the LAP implementation and outcome as ‘moderately satisfactory’. The IDA had made the
following observations, which we recapitulate below.

The achievements of the Project Development Objectives (PDO) were rated by the IDA as
follows:

Institutional Reforms: Highly Satisfactory

Reason being: i) reduction in turnaround time; ii) increase in land transactions revenue; and iii)
implementation of the Lands Commission Act 767 (2008)

Policy Reform: Satisfactory

Reason; Policy initiatives were to develop a foundation for: i) Land Commission Act; ii) Land
Bill; and iii) Land Use Planning Bill. The success as per the PDO and Intermediate indicators
were the: i) completion of a gender strategy; ii) increasing the registration of land ownership by
women; and iii) development of a policy on compensation on compulsory acquired lands.

Pilot Activities: Marginally Satisfactory

Reason: 4 out of the six pilot activities achieved targets, namely: i) Inventory of State
acquired/occupied lands; ii) Established/Strengthening of Customary Land Secretariats; iii)
Establishment of Land Use Planning Models; and iv) Property Revaluation. The remaining two
pilots, Systematic Land Titling (STL) and Customary Boundary Demarcation (CBD) fell short of
achieving the intermediate outcome.

MLNR comments on rating:

MLNR notices that the justification for the overall outcome rating of ‘Moderately Satisfactory’
(Section 3.4, p15) is based on a weighted average of Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory for
the pre-restructuring and post-res restructuring periods, respectively.



                                               48
Moreover, the Implementation Status Results (ISRs) as reported in Section G of the Data Sheet
shows that out of the 17 ISRs reported during the project period, 12 were rated satisfactory,
whilst 4 were Moderately Satisfactory and 1 Unsatisfactory.

Based on the foregoing, MLNR is of the opinion that it would be appropriate to rate the overall
outcome as ‘SATISFACTORY’ NOT ‘Moderately Satisfactory’.

B) MONITORING AND EVALUATION

From the report, the M&E role should have been more vibrant and relevant to the reforms and to
project performance. While the resources were limited and the Regions were not fully engaged, it
appears that the importance of M&E to change management was underestimated.

The report stressed that the concentration on outcomes such as: i) revenue generation by LSAs;
ii) the turnaround time for deeds/titling documentation; and iii) the backlog of land court cases,
caused the limitation to effective monitoring. As such, this did not provide basis for managerial
action, and also did not provide project management with the required feedback on issues related
to the effectiveness of LAP strategies and activities pursued in project implementation.

MLNR comments on monitoring and evaluation:

The conclusion seems to imply that the limitation of effective monitoring was due to the fact that,
the M&E concentrated on the above three out of the seven PDO indicators, thus, resulting in
lack of feedback information to management, on the wider project implementation.

In fact, MLNR is of the view that the M&E unit whilst reporting regularly on key PDOs for ISR
also provided up-to-date data analysis on intermediate outcomes. In addition, reports on project
implementation slippages, with recommendations were submitted, through the Quarterly
Solution Framework and the Annual Field Visits Reports to project management (see Annex 9
List of Supporting Documents, Nos. 21 and 22).

The Report, however, acknowledged that given the very broad scope and complex nature of LAP,
the management of the M&E system in furnishing its deliverables under capacity constraints is
worthy of praise. MLNR accepts this position.
