                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         There was a general consensus that project implementation has progressed satisfactorily and therefore warranted a pre-appraisal of Phase 2. Consequently, the pre-appraisal
                         focused on the design of the Project to increase its readiness for appraisal. It also reviewed and confirmed activities for each component and for the project as a whole including
                         costs, implementation and financial/procurement arrangements as well as on a road map for stakeholder consultations
