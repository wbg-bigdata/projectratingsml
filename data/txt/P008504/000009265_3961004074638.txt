build the Istituonal capacity and skills base to carry out tese eforms; and
(mi) nitate policy work for the development of key sectors.
The proposed Lon would finance technical assistance for:
A. Privazatn and Private Sedor Deweopment. Technical assiste  would

D.  InutluW  &qpport ad Develqpmnt. Technical assistace would be
provided to: (i) support the itroduction of broadly based legal and regulatory
reforms; and (1) improve suategies for environmenta issues.
In addition, this loan would finance the establishmnt of a Project
Imnplemoentaon Unit (PIU) to support the implementationof this Loan and
futureloans.
The proposed Lman would provide crxitcal support to the development and
imple on of the Government's reform progrm at i crucial time. Over
the last eighteen mont, the Government of Kankhstan bas embarked on an
enmive program of reforms, affecting all sectors of the economy. However,
the Goverment curreny has limited isituional capacity and necessary
human resource skills to furtier design and implement dtese reforms. It is
imperative dtat the momentum of the reform program be continued,
picularly during this diffieult period of tranition when dissatisfaction and
fstation with the deteriorating eomic and social situation is growing.
The main mr is ncude: (i) the risk that some of the technical assistae may
not be fully used or used to best advantage by the ministries whicit are slow in
carying ou*t economic reform; and (ii) Kazakstans' limited adminisive
capt and lack of fmiliaty with Bank procurm         an disbursemenat
prcedur, which could limit asorptive capacity and lead to significant
delays. The provision of technical assistance to criical ministries and
agenies i aimed at assistig in the prepaation of their respective reform
programs, and is in direct support of the Govemen's priorities. Close
spesion during implementaion will assure that inefficiencies are addressed
as needed. Prourement and disbursement risks will be reduced through close
attention to procurement and other implementation constrais and the
financing of technical assistnce to the PIU during project supervision.
Cofining not enisaged. However, substantial paralld financing from the
BC, EBRD, and USAMD has been pledged, and has been taken into account in
the design of dtis project.

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKIC       AN
T    NICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1          The Goveament of Kazlktn is in the process of developing an ambitious reform
program to tansform its eoonomy, and already some impo     action have been intiated. Thaere
has been considerable progress on systemic refonms, patudaly as regards the adoption of a far-
reaching privatzat  program and the abolition of multiple exchange rates. Prices have been largely
liberalized, and most state orders have been abolshed. Critical steps have been taken on the refom
of the financial system, with the drafting of new banking legslation and the emgence of new
commrcal banks. A new consttuton was adopted in Jamnuy 1993, which allows for an appropriate
regulatory framewo* in private sector actvity. Iortant steps have also been t     at the sectwal
level to assure the   t   tranfoa n and growth of econoi productan.
1.2          The design of the reform progm  has generated a fuitdfl dialogue with t. IMP and
the Bank, and iportant meaures are being dicussed to foster monetauy and iscal discipline and
stabiize the economy. The IMP is cu y woring on an rrangement with the Goverment to
support the refom program, and the Bank is also plaing to support a program of systemic and
stuctral reforms through a series of loans, of which this will be the first.
1.3          In the meandme, the Bank is concned that public suort and hence conmtied
Implemenio of Kaz tans economic reform program is tratend by growing dis        o
and frlusaton. It is important that efforts aimed at providing sustained supr to the reform
progrm, parcularly those which will contio   direcdy to economic output and well-being, be
undertaken as soon as possible in order to alleviate this frustration. It is therefored   that
technical assistae be inated immediately in a  mber of key areas to assist in the design of the
refom progam and build up the insttutional capacities and skills needed in a market environment.
This technical assisce wil be financed under the proposed Lon. Purther Bank suWort could be
provided in the fonn of investm   loans in selected sectors, and a Rabilitation Loan could be
procesed once full agreemet as been read on the macroeconoc framework. lTe Government
reform program and the Ba's stategy in Kazakastan is discssed extensively in the
President Report.

II. LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE
2.1           he uccess of Bank technical assce project has been mixed. Although the
individual cirumstne and condidons withn couties have varied greatly, there are nevertheless a
nunber of lessons which can be drawn from past experience.
2.2          In general, the most sucesf tecical assistace projects have been those which
have been hliked with specific investment projects. These technical assisae projects have usually
been very focussed, and have been fMlly ideified as part of an investment project. The second most
successful category of techncal assistance projects are stand-aone institution-building loans which are
designed to support reform progms. The least successfud techical assistance projects are loosely
defined projects that are tied in with structr adjusutent projects.'
2.3          This project fals into the second category of techical assisa    projects. With the
proper planning and attenion to other experiences, this tpe of loan has the potential to be fuly
successful. Reviews of past multsecoral techical assisace loans with a focus on insitutional
building suggst that such projects are most successful if they are developed in the context of the
Government's own  insttutional development objectives, and with Government commitment and
involvement in the spefication of the progrm and project administation. The success of the project
also depends on careful project preparation inchuding (i) development of detailed terms of refeence
for expert assistance and training; (ii) provision of training prior to the initation of the program,
(iii) coordintion with other donors/ledrs, and (iv) consideration of the absoptive capacity of the
Govanment. Finally, succesl tchnical assistawe projects require intensive supervision of the
operaion by the Bank once Implementation has begun.
2.4          The design of the proposed opation reflects the concern for learning from past
experience. The proposed program has bee developed  rough close collaboration with the Kazakh
authorities, at the level of the lead authority (Minstry of Economy), as well as at the level of the
concerned sectoral miniries and other entities which will be involved in the implementation of the
progr-n. To &-pport the project, the Mbisty of Economy bas established .a Project  plementation
Uni (PIU), which wi  be responsible for keeping track of the design and implementtion of the
reform program, as well as providing support to project implementation, particularly with regard to
procum, dislbument, and project (Acounting (Se Au V for additonal information on the
PIU). In terms of project ppon, detld terms of refence for proposed expert assistanuc have
alread been drafted and largely discussed, and are amnexed to the Staff Apprasal Report. A number
of Government officials, including the senior staff of the PIU, have been atdig training programs
ornized by the Bank. Pro    mnt advis=s to the PIU will begin work by July l, 1993.   As far
as supevion is cocerned, significant amounts of Bank resources will be devoted to project
supervision and in addi   the PIU will be staffed In order to perform day-to-day supervision.
1/ Among other reass, these TA projects may be less successful because the borrowing
governments often accqt the TA in order to receive the SALISECAL fumds, rather than through
any genuine commment to the TA components. The TA components of these loans are often
less well defined.



2.5          The Govrnme has a imited mmber of skilled countepas to implemnt reforms
and projects. This project is deged to Improve the absorpdve capaci of the Govenmen, iner
4114 thrugh skils transfer: a significant amount of the resurces wRi be devoted to atranin, not only
tough fora tainng programw and sudy tours. but also through othe-job training provided by
resident speciist who will closely work with dir counterparts. The early establishnt of a
strong PIU, assisted by a mmkber of advisers in key positions, would also address this problem.
2.6          The proposed proJect is complex, covers wveral sectors, and will therfore Involve a
nmmber of implementig agencies. Project angements have been careily dasigned, so that the
MU operates as a genera coordiaor and facilitator of project Implem on, while the sectoral
minities and agcies are responsible for executing the c   conceni  their ree ve
seCors.
2.7          Finaly, 'he Bank has played an hiportt role in fosteing donor coordination, boti
throuh CO meetn  and though support to the establihmt, within the Minity of Economy, of
the Nationa Agency for Foreg Investment (NAFI), which will serve as a coordhaor for all
external assistce. The PW has been established under NAFI for moioring, and assisting i

A  Project Ratoae and Objectv
3.1          The Govenme  of Kazahn  has embarked on an extive program of refoms.
Howver, the capacit of the Government to design and implement reform programs is quite limited.
In addition to its need for asistaMce and advice in policy developmen to promote ecowmic growth,
the Govemen lack the insitutional capability and the hm    reource skills needed for these
progms. Fuer, dis        on    growing as a result of the deterioration of the social and
economic envionment. While economic reform will be a long-term process, it is critical for the
m_matum to be nalntd and for steps to be taknow in key areas.
3.2          In thib context, the objectives of the Loan are to: (i) provide assistance in the desigu
and development of the Govermen's reform poliies and progm; (ii) help build the institutional
caity and skills base to cary out these refoms; and (iii) initiate policy work for the development
of key sectors.
3.3          The Bank has been ang the Govement in id ing sources of financng and
has been workig dicly with othr donor agen  to coordinate technical assistace. In December
1992, the Bank chaired a Consulative Group meeting at which a broad progrm  of technical
sitan  needs was dissed. The donor respons was favorable, and a substal amount of
tecnical assitnce fd    was pledged. For example, USAID is sponsoring a US$3.3 million
program on small-scale privatization, incluing transport; the EC is sending resident advisers to assist
in the oveall privatiton program; and the IMP and a number of central bs from donor countries
have been providing exesive tecical asistance to the Central Bank. Additional grant financing is
xpected to be mvlable over the mediumterm fom a number of donors to finamce tecbnical
.-sstance. However, c          from other sources for the critical technical assistance identified
for this loan will not be fothcoming in the Immdiate future. The urgent need for technical
aistane in tese k  stors coels the Govemment to seek Bank financing, so that work can
begin immediately.
B.Proje Ctnmo
3.4          The proposed Lo  would finance techical assistance priily in the key sectors of
(I) Privadzation and Private Sector Development (US$13,825,000)!; (ii) the Financial Sector
(US$11,735,000); an (Iii) the Social Sector (US$5,990,000). In addition, this Loan would provide

developing the technical asistane program, and will contine to coordinate at headquarters and in
the field to ensure compleme y aitce. AuA provides a detailed descrition of this
cownponel.
3.8          C ay-c   P        z       The Bank's involvement in case-by-case privadzation,
which concerns very large eprises, will be liited; it is expected that other donors, incuding the
EBRD,will provide support. Te Bank program will focus on the preparatory phase of this program,
which includes: (i) the classification and prioritization of fims; (i) the elaboration of guidelines on
proe-rivatization _segmetation and financial resucturing; and (iii) the development of procedures and
regutions to prpare and carry out large privatization transactions, and to deal with enviromnental

3.9          Copoate Goveane and           R        During the transition to a market
economy, rapid changes in prices, diruptions in supply, loss of former markets, delays in the receipt
of accounts receivable, etc., have put a severe strain on the fina l status and liquidity of most
enterprises, even those which could be econolmily viable. Technical assistance would be provided
to dewlop concepts for the fiacal         of and support for very large enterprises that are
economically viable but finanially insolvent or illiquid. This component will build on the iniial
overvi  of dtse firms under the above LoA  componen on case-by-cue privation and will
cover: first, assice in the rapid review of ten major enteris  that appear higly inefficient, with
a view to supportng the state's decisions on the poteal need for pre-pdvtivaon rstucftuing, and
second, on transfer of the enterpises' bank loans to a speca restuctuing bank or fund. These
reviews woud follow the experiece gained through the similar review of four major minin
entprie in April-May, 1993, with Bank assistance(see Aumex    . The second component would
be mistance to holding comns  under the SCSP in the elaboration of pilot restructurinlquidation
plans. One plan will be established for a very large enterprise that is likely to require malny
liqudaon, and another for a major fim that is likely to warran resuctuin to promote efficient
operaon and privaation. This would involve a strategic    _    of strengths and weaknes as

grs. This degree of market concentration is a cawse for great concern, particuarly when
geogphical and market segmentation are considered. Technical assistace is required to support the
authorities, mainly the Anti-Monopoly Commite (AMC), twough enhancing capabilities in
formlating and enforcing policies to foster competition, in particuldar anti-monopoly, fair trade, and
consumer protction policies, and through the encagement of domestic and foreign trade. The
assistance would focus on strenheg the insdtutional capacty to prepare and implement policies
with regard to de-monopolization, merger control. prohibition of cartels and vertical aeements,
prevention of the misuse of dominat market positions, and enforcement of fair competion
provisions - maily thrugh extense local and overseas training, funds for participation in
inteationa meetings on competition policies, and     t of the AMC's information system.

proving assistance under the CA in draftig a new foreign imvestment law, which will be diussed
by Parliament at its next session. However, much Snore work remains to be done to help develop the
policy, lega, inst"ional, and sklls basis for the regation and promotion of foreig Investment.
Spcificaly, asstce would be given in three main areas: (i) foref  investment regime - policy
formation; leslation; interational and bilat   invesmnent proteon agements; options to attract
portfolio investment including tax policies; and an ant of financing and insurance facilities
available for foreign investments; (ii) foreig investnent negions and montorng; and (iii) foreign
invesment promotion - prmoion strategy, events, materials, media cmpaigns, etc. An=neI

3.13         MNing. 1992 mining export are estimated to have been in excess of US$1 billion,
and account for about 50 percent of Kazastans indutial exports outside the FSU. The mining
sector is a key source of foreign exchange and Govenment revenues, and has the potential to become
an even greater source of revenue and foreign exchange earings should, therefore, receive particular
attention under the Government's reform program. Furtemore, foreign invesmnt will be esental
to fulfill this potendal, which in tun requires the developm  of ler and consistent laws and tax
policies govering investm  in the sector. Tecmical assistance wil be provided to help draft
enablig legiion to complete the cur  laws on land and natural resources, prepare model
coats, and advie on mineral taxson policies. In a      technical assistance is being prvposed



to help the Mistry of Geology organze exist  data in a way that will help potential investors
collect needed information. This componat i furier explained In  M    14.W
2. Jlacal Sector (US$11,735,000)
3.14         As was discussed in Cbapter II, the Goverment has begun reforms in the finan
sector, aimed at developig a sysm  responsive to market demands. However, far-reaching aton
programs must be implemented to furter maform the secor. The most pressing techical
assistance needs relate to the m     of the payments system, the ntroducon of inionally
accepte ac ting and audidng stndards, the strgfthi  of bank supervision, and the
tranmsfomaton of the commercial bnking system.
a. Paymenl  Sysm  (US$6,050,000)
3.15         One of the major problems faced by enteres is delays in settlements. When
entrprises are not paid on time by their customers, they must in tur delay paymes to tdir
sppliers, whih leads to a cascadig problem of liquidky trouot the system. Although nmch of
the delay i caused by the inabilty of entpriss to make payments bece of ficial dificies or
maret conditions, the most significant factor appears to be the infficiec of the paymens system.
Curetly, pyments take week to clear, which leads to increasing amounts of float, which in turn
deses alrady scace financial resoures. Risks of frud are also greay increased by the
neffcincy of the ytem. Moreover, the arent payments system does not genete adequate
inormation for the liquidit manent of banks.
3.16         The IMP and the World Bank, assisted by the Bank of Japn, have outined a
comp         program to modeize the contry's payments system. It is esdmated that this
progrm would cost   im         US$40 million, and would be implemented over several years. A
nber of        i  steps and improvement have been idenified, which could improve payment
settement to some   ad cod gratly improve the infomaton available to the bank to manage
der liHquiy. In addition to this first phase, the Loan would fund studies to prepare th second
phase of improv    , which would take some three years to implement and to make fully
operational. Specically the component finaced under this loan would support: (i) the national
payments associaton in developing standards, coordinaton arrangements, etc.; (ii) the instalation of
microcomputer at the 270 distrct-level Cash Centers for Improved recording of transacdons,
maintenan  of acouts, and data transfer; (iii) the procurement of micrc uers,
telecomMica nuipmt, and related software, many to improve data   muicadon at the 19
regional Clearing Cetr; (iv) the com rion of NBRK's internal amcoting after the
inroduction of its new accounDtg sysrm; (v) some software for computeized off-site bank
svision; and (vi) strategy, feasibility, and design studies for the longer-torm improvement to the
payment system, incluin development of a bank service bureau network that would enhance the
Intefce of babks with the new payments system. The implen    of the second phase as wel as
the service bureau nwork could be fanced under the proposed future Finacial and Eerpris
Sectors Development Lon  Details of the progm  to modernize          payme  system are
given in c I-A.
b. Acnting and Bank Diagosti Stues (US$3,600,000)
3.17         The Bak hs begun workig with the NBRK and the commercial banks to devdop
new sadards of bank accung. Under the TCA prom, technical assistane was provided to



help intoduce fian cal       which have been broadly adapted from  aonay accwted
stateme, ad which represe  the fist se toward meeting ntratonal accouning stadards.
These financial         ave been tested in severa Kazakh banks, and by the end of 1993 all
Kazkh bank will be requred to use them. In addition, new chat of accounts are being developed
for bak and other commercI enties with the goal of having them in use by Jarry 1994.
3.18         While these are important first steps in bringing the commeri banks I line with
Internaionl stanrds, the awIl nr  to: (i) deelop additional systems and procedus
for both auditing an accounting; (i) strengthen the acou     and auditi  profesions; and
(ili) foster the developmen of human resoure sklls through training. This loan will finance
technicalas    to the NBRK for (i) additional work on the modenaton of bank accouning,
and (Hi) the development of bak auditing procedures.
3.19         The Loan component will also ilude financial and operational diaostc studies of
the ten largest ban  in mKaazm   These stdes would provde an inm-dp  a    of the
oprational capabilities and the finial condition of these bank. For the Agroprom Bank and the
Savings Bank, the studies would also Include detaied analyses of their ors ( i.e., fcial services
for households and agriculture). For each of the ten bank, the consultants would also propose a
steg and deaied action pla for _ n  ng and potetaly    urg. Implemetation of
weed plans could then be supported in part under the planned Financial an Enterprise Sectors
Developmnt Lan through bank twing arangements and other foms of asitance. Details on
financial and operational diagostic studies are discussed in A_nea Il-B, and accounting reform is
described in A
c. Specilzed Fncal Servic  (US$1,025,000)
3.20         Two issues are becoming increasingly cridcal in the relatioh  betwe  the banks
and the enterprise sector: the arrars of illiquid or insolvent enterprises, and the provision of term
credit to enterprs  for restuturg and new Imvestme. Although outandig enterpse debt has
genally been losing its real value owig to iflation, many ente   face liquidity problems In
reang their bank debt. Once remaiing subsidies ae reduced and budge consaits hardened,
many more enterpes are ikely to become unprofitable and eventualy insolvent. This Loan
cmponen would therefoe include a study on te problem of bad bank debt,   lug, inter
ala, an ase         of the magnitude of the problem (i part by buing on the rests of te above
diagostic bank studies); a detailed outine and evauaion of a potential debt recovery fund or bank
for Xt 30 to 40 most important lossmaking enteprises, making debt relief and addidonal liquidity
conitiona upon specifc restructuring and pdvaton, or liquiation acdons; and a poti
strategy for the problems of eidst  debt and new financing of underefring enterprises. The
second part of this Loa component would address the need for and provision of term fiancing for
restctuing and new bi men. Pmarily, it would include an mo amnd poteil design of
a special fund, or ateative hstitutional  nsms, for lending to post-privazaion restnuctg.
It would in pardcuar also look into the options of involving commrcWi bank in channeling or on-
lenig such monies. A more ensve description of this component can be found in A     I-D.
d. Baking 9||d    (US$1,060,000)
3.21         The development of a strong banking system will depend in part on the caacity for
pmdeni supervision over th baking system. Since prudeni supervision i In its fomatve



-10-
stags, it is beset by a number of problem. These include: hndequate staffing; salaries tiat are not
competitive with those in the private sector; weaknsses in the banking law; unclea  powers to
effectivel3 4eal with the large former speciaized banks; supervisory procedur that were designed to
ensure compliance with economic reions and which are now outdae  and a fnancial syste  that
is heavily distorted by massive amounts of subsidies, eina   cedits, and lening to loss-making
state enteprises.
3.22         The NBRK has now star  reorganizig its supervision fumction, rerun many
more staff, Improving pdntil reuations, and reformig its praces. The      and USAID are
providing assistane on bank licensing, off-site supervision, and issues itvolving foreig exchange.
The Bank Lon, through this componet, would supplemen this effort by assistig the developmet
of on-site supervision capblt. The assistce would be heaily gaued toward institutions builing
and skils developm. In pardcula, two resident advisers e ienced in bank eamination will, for
up to two years, lead tems of eamines into banks to be trained trough a mix of classroom
instruction and on-the-job application. In the process, such pilot exriinations would be caried out
on some 16 to 20 bans per year. In addition, the advisers would provide examination manuals,
advice on the c  erization of on-site speviso, and further related services. In the medium
term, under the planed Financial and Enterprise Sectors Development Loan, the two advisers would
be supplemented and then replaced by more specilzed exminon aets with special focus on, for
example, problem bab and specialized financia services. AnnII-E provides an exteni
dibussion of this componet.
3. Soda Secto and Hmnan Reouc  Deveopment (US$5,990,000)
3.23         During this period of economc reform, the economy i undergoig a very dificult
tranitio. Among othr diffcuties, the  trucurg of industry has drastically Incresed
unemployment; also price libalization has resulted in inflation which bas not ben matched by wage
and benefit iceases, resltg in a serious drop in living standards.
a. Sda  Safety Net (US$1,570,000)
3.24          npymemt. During the transition period, employment wil almost cerainy
deteriorate drasticaly. The number of unemloyed increased from about 4,000 in January 1992 to
over 70,000 by the end of 1992 (i.e., 1 percent of the totl labor force). A high proportion of those
currently unemployed have be laid off by material production units and by service (especially
mitary complemes) units, and the rate of unemployment is exed to contnue accelerating rapidly.
3.25         Allevit  the unemployment situation is critical during the transition, not only to
prevet a declHne in Ihing standads, but more important, to _min thie morale of the populaton.
The Miity of Labor has limited expeience in prvidig employment services on a mass scale, and
its staff are not equiped technially and lack the practical experience to handle the deterioratig
amploymen situation in the short nm. Technical  e , therefore, is imperative to streng   the
M ginstry of Labor so that it can cope with the challenge of aiond unmployment.
3.26         Tecmcal assistance would be provided to (i) help design and implement policies and
progrms in the immedie short nm in the area of unemployment relief; (ii) train staff in labor
maret poL;cies conducive to a maket ecanomy and man e demnd foecsti; (ill) help modify



-11-
the strtue of employment serces to make them relevant to the changig economc, social, and
political environments. The proposed progrm is described in Annex m-A.
3.27         Sodal Protection. Duing the transition period, the design and Implm n of
programs to protect the tnost vulneable groups is cntical. The Govenment has righy idenified te
vulnerable groups as pensioners, the disabled, families with many children, and single mothes. To
prevent a decline in their living stndards, the prevailing open-ended program of assistance must be
restructured into a well-targeted and fiscally susinable program. Whle the country has long
experience in serving the above groups, the present budgetay strains as well as iationary
conditions call for additional measures. Technical assistance is considered essential to achieve this
goal quickly.
3.28         The main purpose of this technical assistance is to (i) train persomel of the Ministry
of Social Protcion, (ii) provide spedalist advice in the design and implemenion of income security
schemes and a voluntary pension fund, and (iii) provide techical eqipment (mic).
Technical advice in this area will focus on the mechanisms for targetng benefits toward vulrable
groups, on the design and operation of the voluntary pension fund, and on the needed modificaions to
the overall institutional famework to make it more viable during the period of fiscal contraction.
Amex me gives more details.
3.29         Povet Monitoring. Pbverty and the protection of vunerable groups is a new issue
for the Goveument. The growth of a private sector may initally lead to a widening disiutlon of
income, and thus to the possibility that some groups will not be able to make the transition to the
market economy with the same ease as others. Whereas income growth is a positive developmat in
the long rm, the immediate concern is the growing mber of poor and of vulnerable groups in the
coury, and the need to protect them from falling further into poverty. An essenial pat of this
straty is to idenify the poor and to implement policies to protect them by establishng a
comprehsive and realistic poverty line, and by designing a monitoring system,  i    a reliable
family budget survey. This comnent is further discuss%' in Amex M-B.
b. healtb Care Rdoe (US$620,000).
3.30         The major issue is the size of the health care system (in  and staff) and its
curative bias. The past system was not able to improve the health status of the popuaton and the
health status is now declining. This is due not only to a declning budget, but even more to the lack
of a health policy or program strategy ad to the faiure to adopt modemn preventive methods, as well
as to nadequate training of staff. The newly approved health law and the contry's strong motivation
for reform are usefid starting points for resucrng the health system, including privizng some
services and inoducing medical insmance. Currently, senior health managers lack the experience
and capability to operate a modern health care system. Without changes in orgnizational suture,
improvements in operating systems, and trainig in management, it is unlikely that the new health law
(and policy) can be successfully implemented. The proper techical assistance would make it possible
to improve the traiing of senior staff and produce the necessary insrmet for implein. On
the financial side, the health care program has historically relied on Goverment fincg. Given the
strain on the budget, it i unrealistic to assume that the Gove et can coniue to  stain heath
care trough direct budget transfers. Alternative forms of fiancing and cost recovery will be needed.
The Minity of Health, however, has little experience and capaiity in planning and operating a
complex health insurance sceme and the health sytem has no system of cost acntng on which to



-12-
base reI         from insurance companies. The ministry also lacks access to infomation and
experience with other fonms of cost recovery in the health sector.
3.31         Technical assisnce would be provided to the Miistry of Health to advise and train
personl to: (i) develop a coprehesive national health policy, strategy, and acompanying
guideines on integrtion of preentive and promoting health care programs; (l) streamline
organiational sur; (iii) devise clear policy, law, and guidelins on private health care, including
the phar eal sedor; (iv) devise capital and operational budgetng prcedr; (v) introduce cost,
accounting and re         systems; and (vi) devise altemative strategies for cost recovery and
savings. An extensive desciption of the health care reform program is given in Amex m-D.
c. Tranng (US$3,800,(00).
3.32         The radical change from a command economy to a market-oriented economy has
resulted in a sharp mismatch in the job skills needed in the new economy and those cumry
available, and trang will be needed in almost every sector. In addition, the Government's limited
capacity to: (i) design new tax, trade, social and legislative programs; (ii) absorb foreign aid and
eouwage foreign investment; and (iii) improve the goveance of state-owned enterprises are all
indications of the need to retrain civil servants. Under this Loan, trainmg would be provided in
(i) the financal sector, (ii) entetprise management, and (iii) the civil service. The proposed program
includig detailed scope and costig, is furither described in Am x E-.
3.33          hmcudlal Sector Trainn. Tramnig in the financial sector would be provided for
bankers and bank accounts. Currently, training in these areas consists largely of courses of shot
durtion which are more akdn to exposure than to training. While the exposure undoubtedly builds
awarees of banking techniques, it cannot provide the skldls needed for moden commercial banang
activies. Increasingly, training will need greater consistency and depth. The prposed
subcomponent for training bankers aims to build a sound and consistent foundation that can be further
developed in fiture projects. While the program should first address the most pressing needs, a
process dould be put in place to ensure that evolving needs are met. The strategy to achieve the
main objectives will be to invite an established banking training insdtiuon with inteational
xperience to provide assista   in the selection and preparation of curriculum and materials and to
supply ae expertise and experienced trainers to initiate trining in key areas (including the
selecdon of outside taning providers when available), to train national trainers, and to assist the
NBRK with the permanent training insdtute to be established. The assisting instiuton's staff would
work closely with NBRK staff on all aspects. Proposals from qualified banking training isitutions
wil be invited mmediately following Board approval; consultant field work will stut in fte mme
of 1993, and the s  n t wil be completed within a year
3.34         Coniderable efflorts are requred to train, retain, and upgrade bank accountat (and
auditors). Ther previous training was essentialy along the lines of bookkeeping. A modermed
banking system will requie many accountan  with different qualifications (such as financial
accung, man        cost accounting, audidng, infomaton systems) for the new needs of a
market-oriented economy. The training strategy for this subcomponet, to be implemented by the
NBRK, would comprise: (i) sending practitioners, bank accountants, and teaching faclty members
a&bad for short or long periods; (ii) bringing in patriate practice-oriented bank accoutn  to help
upgrade exsing accuntig professionals and help revamp the amunting methods and procedur  in
use, or to be hed; (Il) developig in-house courses and courses outside the respective ban  to
upgrade exst  accunting staff, using expaiate instructors; (iv) developing traing matedals of



-13-
various kinds of an elementay and a more advanced nature to assist in the revamping; (v) tasating
and adpting feig  aig    maerials and tests, and developing local tea meals for trahinig and
education; (vi) developing uditing guidelines and procedu  for banking, and training nd mateials
for these areas; and (vii) preparing rmdons on relevant accouting programs and curricula
of univerities and other institutions. The aim would be to implement this subco qponent at the
ealiest possible date, which would requre inviting proposals frm qualified training istons
immuday follo g Board  proval, starting cotsultant field work in the late summer of 1993, and
competing the sucmoet within a year.
3.35         EnteeMn              Training. Enterprises that have already incorporaed and
toe likely to remain in the public sector in the short or medium term are facing the adjustmen to a
market system vitay without experience of free markets and, in many cases, without the necessary
understnding of basic economics and management principles. As a result, in addition to the
inevitable harsips imposed by the loss of markets and the scarcity of parts and raw materials, large
inficiencies and losses result simply from inadequate decision making owing to a lack of insight in
basic mates such as costing and pricing of products, efficiency and productivity montoring,
marketing, and worker mouion and persomnel management (and also from traditions of disregad
for product quaity and finish, and of non-delegation of decision makdng per se). Under those
_   -   , mam  traiing is a clear priority and expenditures in this area should have high
.amu
3.36         While solid commitmen on the pan of the Govermment would be critical to the long
rtm success of this suIcomponent, the strategy for this first phase of assistance to enterpise
management training is to start rapidly, on the basis of the experience and ability of forign agencies,
and to use this iniUal period to establish close libks with the Kazakh Government as well as with local
trning institutions, both public and private. To achieve the above objectives, a six-pronged strategy
wold be employed, consistng of: (i) training of managem    trains; (ii) an internship program for
Kahsta manager; (ii) preparaion of Kazakhstan-based taing materials; (iv) onhe-job training
of mangeme  consultants; (v) action learning; and (vi) creating of lin  with local training
insttto.
3.37         Pulc Sector           I Train. As Kazakhstan moves from a command
economy to a market eco, the role of the Government will change fun lly. As a
conequce, the atfttudes, knowledge, and sMklls of civil servants wiU also need to change radically.
As the new funcdons and processes of the Government emerge, it wfll need to develop medtods of
Ide ing these new requiements, and to develop a strategy and a permanent but flexible program to
help tain and retrain civil servants to meet them. For a maximum impact, traing should start as
eady as possible and at high levels of authority in the service, and shoiud include the trainig of
tsinr. The purposes of this sbeo       are to: (i) help the Govemment redefine the role of the
civil service and support its restucturing for its key functions in a market economy (in synerg with
other techc  al    e provided under the Project); (ii) idenif the attitdes, knowledge, and skldls
needed by civil sens to meet new job requieme; (iii) develop a str    and programs for the
necessay taing, (iv) initate tng of selected civil servants, including tainers, through seminas,
study tours, and fol up training programs to be carried out by graes of the programs; and
(v) develop capacit in selected training instituons in Kazakhstan to provide future aining for the
public service. The strategy for this component would be process-oriened. The core of the program
would be a series of tbree diagnstic seminars, each with about 100 partcpants, organized with the
hlp of consulas  and held at regular four- to- six-month itervals In Amaty. Between the



-14-
semi_as, study tours would be arranged for selected seminar participants with the assistance of the
consltants, and participants would also prepae and carry out local 1tining proams.

a. Lgal Framework (US$2,135,000)
3.38         To suwort the refonn progrm, extemive new leslation in all sectors of the
economy is being prepared. Parliament has approved a new Central Banking Law and Conunercial
Banking Law, prpard with IMF and Bank assistance. The Bank has also provided assistance, inter
al/a, on  rei  direct investment, privatization, banuptcy, and energy legislation. Under this
project, assiance would be given to the Govemment, not only in the drafting of new legslation and
regulations, but in the d velopment of an overall legd framework. This would include:
(i) cooordintion to ensuso consistency among the new laws being drafted; (ii) development of
information and document sources; and (iii) strengthening of implementaton and enforcement through
providing advice on insdtutions, including agencies, regulatory bodies, the courts and other settlement
nisms, mand in training of staff. A subconponent will address banking sector legislation,
espeay to help develop legislation on financial instrumens, the payments system, and the
Implementaton of the Law on Banking. Further details on this component can be found in
AnnxL-A.
b. E e nt (US$1,040,000)
3.39         E on         issues are paticularly important in Kazakhsan. Numerous sectors,
incudig minig, energy, industry, and agriculture, need extensive environmental work. Technical
asssn  will be provided to: (i) assess and upgrade the institional capacity of MEB and related
rsu-zations for enviromental nmangement; (ii) develop interim guidelines and regUadons for high
priority sectors related to privatization and re rc g in industy and agriculture, particularly in the
areas of enviromental review, environmental audit, and envi  liability; and (iii) assess
information resources and nitoring systems and enhance the capacity for priority setting. The
proposed assitamce is fiurter detailed in AnneI--B.
5. ProJect    _m          (US$3,225,000)
3.40         To support the implementation of this Loan, tLee Govermment has established the
Ptoect Implementation Unit (PIU). Responsibilities of the PIU are detailed in Annex . This
component of the Loan will be used to finance procement and disbursemet advisers as well as two
program coordinators to assist in the implementaton of the project; provide training in financial,

3.50           In order to rapidly sengenthe PIU's procurement capacity, and to assist in the
preparation and processing of the large mmber of conacts to finane under this project, two
procurement advisers will be posted within the PIU. They will contibute to the building up of
institutional capacity within the relevant ministries and will organize seminars on the Bank's
procurement policies and standard bidding documents. The advisers will assist in all aspects of the
selection of suppliers, awarding of conracts, and monitoring and mantaing of records of
procuement activities. The procurement advises will train their K kbstn  cou p     in Bank
procedures and policies, to make them self-sufficent regarding procurmet under subsequent Bank
loans.

3.51         With respect to the procurement of goods (which would concer principally the
puchse of procssig and telec    aons equipment for the payments system and printing and
reatd  equiment), al conac over US$300,000 would be awarded through Inteational
Competitive Bidding (ICB) following the Bank's guidelines and the use of the Band's standard bidding
documents. These contacts are expected in aggregate to amount to US$7,000,000. Kazasan
competin under ICB would receive a pre nce in bid evabuation of
15 pece  of the CIF price or the prevailing customs duty applicable to non-exempt importers,
whidhever is less, provided tat the value added to the product in Kazabstn exceeds 20 Percent of
the ex-fctoy bid price. Since the local electronics and software  usties are not well developed,
local bidders for these major contactt are not expected to be competitve. For goods below a contat
value of $300,000, with an expected aggregate amount of US$1,575,000, procurent will be
une ntkm through Internaonal Shopping (IS) with at least three bids from three member countries.
To ensure compliance with the Bank Procurement guidelines, al contracts awarded through ICB, will
be subject to the prior Bank review.
3.52         The selection of the consulting firms for the provision of services will be carried out
following the Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as
Execui  Agency, "  published by the Bank in August 1981. The ternm of refeence for all consultant
assignments and all contracts for consultant services valued at greater than US$50,000 will be subject
to the Bank's prior reiew and  poval. Other contracts will be subject to the Bank's ex-post review
incluing wher appropriate complete ex-post review on a selective basis.

3.53         The Loan will fiance: (i) 100 percent of the foreign eitures of imported goods,
up to 100 percent of the local expendiures (ex-fctry costs), and up to 75 percent of the
expndtu  for otbor items proued locally; (ii) 100 percent of expenditure2 of consultants'

to be completed by December 31, 1995, and the Loan closing date wouid be June 30, 1996.
Widrwal appicadons will be fully domented, except for expenditures against contraus valued at
less than US$50,000 equivalent, which will be made on the basis of certified statements of
exenditures detaing the individual tansactions. The d eon to support these exenditr
will be retaned by the PIU for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report
for the year in which the last disbursement is made. This d ation will be made available for

ensuring that audits of the financial staemen  or reports are submitted to the Bank.
3.56         The PIU (on behalf of the Borrower) will establish an appropriate accuting systm
to enable information on the proper receipt and use of fiuds provided in accordance with the Loan
Agreement. The system shoud ee  timely and accurate accountn of all transactions under the

accepted acuntig procedures.
3.57         The Special Account which will be establsbed under the Loan is intended to assist the
Borrower with cash flow and to enable early and more effective project implem on and

3.58         Fical Reprting. Financial reporig for the Loan would closely reflect the
specific requrements of the Loa. It would comprise a statement of receipts and payments for the
reportng period since the beginig of the program. The reportin would be in accordae witi tho
disbuements classified and reported by the expenditure categories agreed with the Borrower and
spelled out in the legal doumes. Quarterly progress reports would be subnitted by the PIU,
inluding a separate report in respect of the Special Account. A Project Completion Report will be
submitted to the Bank by the PIU promptly after the completion of the program, and in any event not
later than six months after the Loan dosing date.
3.59         Auditing. A condition of the Loan will be that the fici sttemens and reports on
the Loan (includiug the Special Account) should be audited in  crdace with generally accepted

3.62         The project would be consistent with Bank policy and would foHow accepted Bank
procedures. In conformity with Bank policies for technical assistance operations, no environmental
rating has been assigned. Nevertless, in developing pocuem  procedues for financing imports,
specific provision will be made to ensure that the inclusion of any toxic or hazardous substances
would be under conitios acceptable to the Bank. Also, the question of enviromntal liabiity for
past pollution will become importa  during the privaization process. Lack of clarity on ths issue
could result in ury delays in concluding privaization conats. Therefore, it is essential to
establish clear guidelines on the sharing of the known and potental costs ci remedyig problem  of
past pollution between the state and the prospective new owners. This will require the development
of a coherent strategy and the completion of a thorough inventory and an estimate of the least-cost
measres for mitigation.
a. Bd anRik
3.63          1     . The Government of Kazakhstan has embarked on an extensive reform
program, affecting all sectors of the economy. However, the Government currendy has limited
nstitutional capacity and limted human resource skills to futier design and implement these reforms.
It is imperative that the momentum of the reform prrm   be contiud, partcularly during this
difficult period of transition, when dissisfaon and frustin with the deteriorating economic and
social sitation is gowing. The proposed Loan would provide criticaly needed technical assistance
to directy develop and implement key componens in the Government's refom program, including
the privatzion program, finacial sector restuc,tu    and social sector reform, which will be
essential to the development of a market economy. In addition, it will finance technical assistance to
help sport sensitive areas of the reform program during this difficult transition period, such as
unemployment relief and social protection. This Loan will also finance tecnical assistace which
will support the pace of economic reform and the rate of economic growth through, Inter alia,
encouragn competion, attacting foreign investment, improving the payments system, training
workers in skills needed in a market-based economy, and preparing for fture technical aistance and
sector work.
3.64         RIsks The main risk include: (i) the risk that some of the technical assistance may
not be fully used or used to best advantage by the ministries which are slow in carrying economic
reforms; (ii) Kazalsta' limited administraive capacity and lack of famiiarity with Bank
procurement and disbument procedures, which could limit absrptive capacity and lead to
significanit delays; and (iii) the risk that delays in the enacment of new legislation may hinder the
overall impl ion of the reform program. The provision of technical assistance to critical
ministries and agencies is aimed at assisting in the preparation of their respective reform programs,

and is in direct support of Governmen's priorities. Close supervision dmring implementation will
assure tha inefficienies are addressed as needed. Procureme  and disbursement risks will be
reduced thrugh close antion to procuement and oter Impl tion constrain and finaning of
tecbnsal assistance to the PIU during project supervision. Substantial preparatory work has already
beenm caied out to refom the legal framework, and a number of new or revised laws are in the
process of being presented to Parliament. Close monitoring and selective assistance under the legal
subcomponent would be aimed at avoiding unnecessary delays in the introduction of forthcoming

SUPPORT FOR                ATION OF MAS COPORATIZATION
AND MASS PRIVATIZATION
A. BACKGROUND
1.           The Republic of Kazakhstan embarked in late 1991 on an ambitious privatzadon
program. It used a variety of privatzaton methods, was meant to involve eteprses of al sizes, and
was exeted by a newly created State Property Commttee (SPC) as well as committees under local
authority. By end 1992, about 7,000 producdve units, accounting for about 6 percet of fixed
enteprise assets, had been transformed.
2.           However, the speed of the program fell short of the Gover's exectation, and
would have taken a very large number of years to complete. Only very few of the 7,000 transformed
nterprises were of medium or large size, and even the small ones were often merdy spagmeu nm
off from large unts. Moreover, the medium and large eneprises were commony only
coporaized, with the majority of dsares sfill held by the sate. Transactions did not follow unified
strealined procedures for dierent categories of enterprises but always involved time conuming
case-by-cue decisions.
3.           Moreover, the Govmnt recognized dtat there was much scope for improving the
mpact of privatization on enteprise govemmce, income diriution, and capita makets
developmet. Most of the new private owmers of privatized objects or shares were the worker
collectives or managers of the respective entepri, raiig serious doubts about the expected
postive impact on efective post-privatizaon govenance. Even where the buyers were outsd, the
transfers ofte did not follow competive procedures but rather direct uncoested negotiation. At the
same time, the sales prces were commonly based on historical book vahles that became min gly
unmelic due to accelerating inflation, thus fostering public concerns about fainess. ITe popuatio
at large had little opporunity to participate in the privazation process, for lack of vwouers or
smilar men. The SPC lacked the clear authority and sta in Government to reject
inapproprit privadzation proposals developed by worker collectives, branch mistries, or local
authorities.
4.           The State Prperty Commitee, with support of the Bank, has therefore developed a
coprehensihe new National Pivaizaton Program. This Progam was approved by the Presiden in
early March 1993 and widely publshed in the country. Amendmnt to pertinet legislation were
submitted to parliament in April, as part of a broader package of economic reform legislaon, to
ensure consistency with the Prom. At the same time, the role of SPC was       h rough its
Il    A copy of this Progm  witl be atached to the terms of refeence upon ivitation to bid for
the consultant conact.

transfer into tie Council of Ministers, its Chainman obtaining Deputy Pime Minister stau, and the
submission of all local property committees under its authority.
5.           The National Privatzation Program for 1993-95 pursue privatizaton on three trc:
(i)    Small-scale privaizaton through the use of unuilid housing vouchers and
isymatc pre-sale liquidation, with concurrent privtizaton of wholesale and tking
structures;
(ii)   mass corporatization of the vast majority of medium and large enterprises (between
200 and 5,000 employees) while still maintng 100 percent state ownership;
subsequent mass privatization of these companies with the help of non-materil
vouchers that citizeos can use, exclusively through imvestment funds in cental
auctions, to acquire 51 percent and more of shares of the enterprises;
(iii)   tmporary control of special or very large corporations through holding compaies
with competing portfolios, and the privatization of many of these enterprises tbrough a
variety of mehods on a case-by-case basis.
6.           The small-scale privatization component covers frst of all every enterprise with up to
200 employees in the non-agricultural productive sectors, except a smail number of units that the
Government wihes to retain for the provision of subsidized basic foodstuff or the supply in remote
areas. To ensure that privatized units do not face monopolistic supply strutures the wholesale and
trucking sectors will be privatized conacrenty, both through the auonig of invidu  trucks and
warehouses and through the segmentaion and sale of trde and cargo tranport enteprises. Most
smal enprises, namely, those engaged in retail, catering, and consumer services, shall be fomally
liquidted before sale so that the new operators can start without old liabilides and conual
obligions, and with staff of their choice. The sale of the asset would take place though eution or
tender in the larger municipalities. To enhance the capacity of ordinary citizen to actively participate
in the process and enter into business, the sale will be against vouchers and cash, in a fixed 50:50
ratio. The vouchers used in small-scale privatizton will be the housing voucers that most cidzem
have not or not yet used for buying their housing. These vouchers are denomiatd in rubles, are
mere account entries rather than physical securities, but can be transferred between citiens.
7.           The small-scale privatization component will start initially in six large pilot cities, but
sa be exended to the entire country a few mont  later. The preparation of implementon
arang ; the actual impleaion in the pilot cities; the privadzation of parts of the tucking
and wholesale sectors; a minimum post-privaization assistance; and the initial effbrts to eent the
program to other regions will be supported by a major Bank executed and largey USAID funded
project (close to US$ 4 million over a 15 months period) that is planned to start in June 1993. This
small-scale privatiton project and this ma  privatizaion project will be closely coordinated by SPC
and the Bank.
8.           The caseby-case privatization componen would address very large enterprises (more
than 5,000 employees) and enterprises of special natre (natural monopolies, agdculture, enterprises
with a mainly social function, and potenaly most mining and energy enatrprises). Many of these
enterprs  would be segmented and reorgized, and in a few cases also futer restructrd, prior to



-27-                                Annx I-A
sale. For the purpose of effectively supervising such enterprises and, where appropiate, their
restucturing, SPC is in the process of establishing several temporary holding companies under itself;
enterprises of a sector would be assigned to different holdings to foster competition. (Some of the
medium and large enterprises subject to mass privatzation may temporarily be subordinatd to the
holding company structe as well.). The Government envisages awarding management cotacts
with foreign parties in several of these holdings, especially those active in rstuing. P divatin
would then follow a variety of methods such as auction, commercial tenders, investment tenders,
according to standarized procedures. Only a short list of eantprises of particular state or socia
interest will be excluded from sale. The EBRD is planning to provide substatial tehnical assistance
to the privatiuzation trnsactions of such very large and special enterprises. A limited amount of
assistance to the establishment of holding companies, and to the improvement of the goveance of
corporatzed state enterprises, will be provided under the Bank's Teclical Assistance Loan that
finances also this contract for mass corporion and privatization.
9.           The mass privaftizaon component deals with all state entrprises not included in the
small-scale and case-by-case privatization components. It has been estimated that there were about
8,000 medium and large enteprises (except those in above mentioned specia sectors) in Knklstan
at the end of 1991. The National Program envisages the rapid priatization of this category of
enterprises over a three to four year period. The mass privatization shall directy benefit wide layers
of the populWation, follow transparent and competitive procedures, and create ownership structures that
are conducive to effective governance.
10.          All citizens would obtin, presumably through the Savings Bank network,
"privatization investment coupons" that are actually non-material account entries, denominated not in
a currency but in abstract "points". The coupons will not be transferable, and can be used only to
invest in licensed privatization investment funds. These fumds would be in the prvate sector, and
subject to stringen licensing and supervision. More tian 50 percent of the shares of each enterprise
to be privafized would be offered for sale against coupons; a fiuter 10 percent of shares cod be
purchased by the labor collectives for free in the form of preference shares. The shares would be
sold in cental and, perhaps, regional auctions conducted by a State Privatiztion Fund under SPC,
a taking place in seereal waves. Only the licensed privation investment fund would be allowed
to participate in these auctions. The individual citizens would participate in the mass privatzation not
through direct purchase of state enterprise shares but through purchase of privatization investment
fund shares. Each privafization investment funds would be allowed to buy no more than 10 percn
of the shares of any enoteprise in the auctions, but it can sell and buy enterprise shar aft the
auctions to or from other investment funds, local investors, or foreign buyers. Active public
information efforts would educate and inform the citizens, and encourage their participation.
11.          Prior to their privatization, al enterprises except those subject to the small-scale
privatiizaton compon   shall be cotporatized. The objective of this mas cooratization exercise
include the improvement of enterprise governance and the facilitation of  ubquet privatization this
would be achieved mainly through the introducdon of supervisory boards and proper states of the
enterprises, and the clarification of the legal status and property rights of the firms. While some
corporatization would proceed with prelmnary procedures so as not to delay the start of mass
privatization, the inftuctur for corpoaization, especially the compny registy, wold be
establisbed. In order to simplify the copatizaon process, the corporatizton itself would not
involve the transfer of shares from the state to non-state enit ies; i.e., coa n would precede
any privazaton. Moreover, for further stramlning the fims cowld be inpate at their exsting
book value.

Techicl Assisce Loan to Kuzdkstan  It will also be supported by a gr-funded TA Project of
EC TACIS that will dedicate about US$2.1 million to mass privatzi  begining in Jly of 1993 for
aroxmely one year, with potential folow-up funding a year late. The BC coanulnts are
expected to provide policy, legal, and technical advice on the overall mass privazati  comp ,
investment funds, and various other mass privatization matts, including alo some 17 man months
assistance for public relations. Other donor agencies are not curreny exected to provide  l
suport to the mass prvzation component.
B. OBJECIVES
14.          The objecdves of the Project are to assist SPC in:
*     coinuing the detailed implemenwion planning of the mass privaztion component
(ncludig corporatizaion) of the National rivtizaon Progm  inluding the
prepration of necss  legal texts;
a     enhaning the institticnal capacity for this component, including the estbl t of
new inrstuctu  (such as company registry, State Privatization Fund, and
Investment fund supevisory strucres) and the development of human skills;
i     implementing the mass privatization component (including coaon) of the
Prom for a substantial percentage of the enterprises meant to be subject to this
component; and
e     monioring the sucess of dte Program comonent, and proposing on this basis further
Improvements In the Implementaon arage    of the National Privtzton
PMM
15.          AUl tis work shall be cared out in a manner contibt  to the ova objectives of
the National Privatization Program, and ensuring close coordination with other assistance program
coveng mass privatization and related fields. In particular, the support shall ensure that the
progam t          (i) leads to effictive enterprise govemance and a compedtive busiess
envim ent; (il) twra  ownerhip rapidly; (iii) distrbute ste pror fairly, anparny, and in

C. ASTANCE STRATEGY
16.          The assistmce will extend over a 18 nmuths period stg  in July/Aust 1993. At
least half the inputs of the Consultantg are epected to be provided in the first 6 months of the
Pro-j.
17.          The conact for the Project will be awarded to one general contactor. The genea
conactor is encouraged to subnact    ones of the contract to other cow.ltants. It is
suggestd hat the ontact thus be divided into five main subm :
(i)   project and team coordination, and overal policy and legad advice;
(ii)   corporazation;
(iiW) investment funds and privatization invesment coupons;
(iv) preparaton of firms for sale, share auctions, and post-privatization activities;
(v)   publi information.
18.          The Consultants will liaise closely with other conultas and conat team that
support entrris and financl sect reform under the Bank fundig. in pardcular they wWi
coordite very closey with the resident Legal Reform Coorditor in all matters of legislation.
19.          The consultant team under the smller EC-TACIS cont   will provide assistance to
some of the mass privAzato sub-components, such as lega advice, public ifomation, and the
preaation of share aucto. The volume of this assistance is insufficient to cover but a few of the
to adeqte etent to ensure the qualt, speed, and sdstainabiliky of the mass
privatit  component. The Bank funded Con   will therefore complement this EC assistae in
Impota  areas. Coinued close coordination between the Bank and EC head offices, and close
cooriation between the two teams in the field, shall aim at d butng task and ensurig the
efficiency of the interfaCe.2
20.          Training wil form an important element of each sc     of the mistance.
Most of this tra   will most efectively take place on-the-job through the close collaboration
betw    advisrs and local coutrpa staff. Frtmore, each             wil include vaio
formal tin     evets, such as workshops, regulr presentations or grop discswdons, and ad hoc
Instuctions on current topics. Almst all this trainig would be undake by th   team membes
that provide techical assitance; adtional tinr should be included only where partclar lessons
from other coies shall be emphasized, or where standard topics shall be taught direcdy in Russia
lauge that the rdevat technical advisor may not speak. Moreover, the aciviies include the
orgniztion and  a         of 4 study tour for an average 4 local staff to  merly socialist
counties or other suitable locations, on mass privatization policy in genal (for senor officials);
company restrDon; inveshtm  funds and securites market regulation; and voucher-based share
auctios.
ZI    The detaBed version of the TOR will show more clearly which specific tasks will be exeuted
by the Bank and the BC teams.

D. COUNTERPARTS AND IMPLEENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
21.          The coordinating agency for this Project, as part of the Bank's Technical Assistance
Loan, is the National Agency for Forein Investment at the Ministry of Economy. The Project
Implementation Unit for the Technical Assistance Loan, which is also located in this Agency, will be
responsible for contac    and logistical arrangements.

committee and twety-one oblast-level commitees with branch stats. SPC plan, to delegate some of
its responsibilities in mass coxporatizon and privatization to a new State Privatizatioa Fund under its
supervision; holding companies under its ownership; and agents that it authorizes. Accordingly, the
consus  if requested by SPC shall assist also the State Privatiation Fund and SPC's holding
compaies, and in exceptional cases authorized agents.
23.          In certain subcomponents of the Project, the consultants will need to coordinate and
collaborate with frther institutions, such as the State Committee for Price Policy and Anti-Monopoly
Policy; the National Agency for Foreign Investment; the Departmen  of Sewrities at the Ministry of
Finance and tl; National Bank of the Republic of Kazakbstan; the offices of the President, Prime

team.
1.    The consulats on this sub-component will coordate their work very closely with
the EC-TACIS te4m, with the operational and planing sections of SPC, and with the other members
of the Conslant tam, In order to prepare public informaton actions timely and appropriately.
Different from the EC-TACIS team, the Consultats will concente on specific public information

F. REPORTING
25.          The consu   will smbmit a series of regular Project reports, as weil as special
sudes. The special studi are listed above under Activies and Outputs. All reports shall be
submitted to the Governmnt (NAFI, SPC, First Deuy Prime Minister, and other agencies as may
be requestd by the Government) in a total of at least eight Russian laguage and two English

33.          The conta  includes a US$700,000 contgency in the Consultant Contact, and
hurther a US$500,000 contingency outside the Consltant Contract. Together, this amounts to some
l9peet of this Project Component. This is considered necessaiy due to the high likelihood that
signicant  sistao  needs will emerge that caot be foreseen for the entire 18 months contra
period. This is due to the high compleadty of a mass privaztion and corporatzation program, and
its susceptibility to change in its economic and poLtical envment. The progm  involves the vast
majorty of the country's medium and large enterpries, all cites, and a range of financial
institutions. A whole new Infabuctur has to be crated for coupon use, imvement fumd
regulatn, company regisadon, sbare auctions, secondary shae tding, and so forth. Experience
with simla proga in other transition economies shows that it would be highly advantgeous for the

complexity will likely require the spining-off of non-core operadons and major social asse, and
perhaps the segmentation even of the cor activities into more coheret entities, or into entities that
ensure soe competiton in the loca market. Special an ises are enterpise that require an
adequate regulatory fwraework prior to thei privatizaton, or the sipulation of detail regatory
provisions in the privatzation contac  or other documents. This would apply to firms dtt are
naua monopolies, provide largely non-commercial functions, exploit non-rneable naurl
resou, or are enggd in certain agri-processing actvitis.
2.           Case-by-case privatization will suosedly follow rather traditional methods of
prvatzai on. Soeime, a seoral approach could be applied to aieve economies of scale in hie
prepaatory work. neational commercial tender is foreseen as the main method of sale, altog
mivesutent tenders and other competive metbods are also prvie for. Some of the frms may
require significan pa to              ing, although major physical vtin   should be Idt
to the new pdvate owners to undertake.
3.           Often, the followig steps may require the asise of extenl ep : (i) Review
Of seected speci fima or sus rs; (i) review,  omn, and  mpenutatlon Of
strengthening  the subsector regulatory policies and instittions; (iii) pra    segiaton,
financial trucring, envronmental audit, and minor physcl fixing up of the entrre, as may
be advisable; (iv) preparation of sale though vali   enterpris              p      e,
etc.; (v) condct of tender or other methods of active buyer search, many abrod; (vi) contact
negotiatons; (vii) montoring and enforcement of conct terms.
4.           So far, peraps a dozen very large firms have undergo  ownersp transforaons
of some sort or other, Including the dilution of the state's shares thrugh extera prive Invemn,
or transfer of sbare packge to worker collectives. A first truly hntrationa tender for a major fim
has recety been annoucd to be a tobacco processg company of consderble vale. Other very
large or special firms have eterd into var   trise groupigs (asocatio, holdings,
conglomeraons, etc.) that oftan replicate fomer branch ministrstuctures, ivolve   n m _
crosholdings of shares, and consider temselves "destatisized" commercial struc     a   the
ultimate shareholder is stll the state. SPC, by contrs, seek to form tmpory holding compnies
under its ownesip, as a vehicle for ind  but more business-oiented financial supervision of the
enterprises.
5.           The casby-case privaization         of tie Naionad Privatli'4n Program will
tahe many years to complete. Yet its sta with a number of the enterprises should not be delayed so
that these Importat firms enjoy better governance, obtai foreign  and malret access,

and IFC plan to suport individual large case-by-case taactions as merchan banking oeations.
Further transacdons may be assisted by private merchn banks, somees on a success fe basis paid
out of diwvstire revemne. Donor agencies will in fture also provide financing for expert assistace,
especially for subsctor ad enterprise studies - as will soon be done by the European Community -,
and for the difficult partal restruting it preparation for sale.

SUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE
SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMET OF EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE
OF SrATE EN
A. BACKGROUND
1.           To improve their efficiency, enpses need not only competitive markets, an
adequate legal frmework, an appropriae capital strcture and mange_m  capabty, but also
effective corporate govemance. The owners of enteprs  need to set objectives focused on
profitability and the value of their investm , to hold managers accountable for the financial
performance of their enterises and to give those managers broad opertional auonomy.
2.           Privatization is the Govermnent's main policy mehanism for strengthening corporate
governance. It aims, over the next few years, to give private core owners control over the large
majority of entpise. However, even the rapid mass privatiaon program, supported by this
Loan, is expected to take three years to complete; which leaves an interim period during which the
State wil remain the sole or majority owner of a large, albeit rapidly declining, number of
eneprises. Moreover, very large enterprises and a small number of enteprises in special categories
wi1 undergo slower case-by-case privatization; while a few will be excluded from privatization for the
time being. Effective governance of state entprises therefore remains a critcal issue. At the same
time, given the inacy of the Kazal sta's market economy, the changes in the corporate govemance
of the state enterises should provide a clear example also to the way in which private companies are
expected to be run.
3.           At present, state enterpris  in Kazakhstan are not subject to effective govermance.
The State does not effctively exercise its role as owner but intervenes instead in its enterprises in a
somewhat haphazrd manner. The major weaknmesses of the presen corporate governance regime may
be smmarized as follows:
a. The objectives that the State appears to impose on its own enterprises are principally:
(i) achievement of production volumes; (ii) preservation of employment; (iii) provision of
social services; and (iv) the filfiHiment of trade agre. Enterprises managers are not
required - and therefore feel little obligation - to generate profits and to maimize the
potental value of their firms.
b. Whilst there is a financial reporig system in place, enterprises managers are, in reality,
not held accouable for the financal performnce of their enterprise. This problem
aries firstly from the oudated and inadequate accounting policies, system  and financia
eportig fornats. Reported financial results do not therefore reflect the real fcial
pefmance. nspection of financial results is aimed at detering and detectng fraud
rather tban  enfin  reasons for and ways to rectify under-performance. Secondly,



-43-                                 Annx I-C
indir  subsidies and price controls furer blur the results of ent . Thirdly, the
concept of a rate of return on the capital invested s not widely undestood.
c. Mamgers do not have sufficient operational autonomy. They are constty subjected to
interfarence fom their branch (setor ministry) and local authorities. In rer,  mangers
turn to those authonties foy assistmce in resolving fincial and other opeational
problems, many of which they should solve on their own.
d. The lines of authority abovt the enterprises are unclear. The director (chief executive) of
an enterprise is appointed by the branch ministry. Thee were formerly many branch
ministries but the majority of these have been converted into "concers". Today most
enterprse managers are responsible to their concerns, rather than directly to Government
ministries. Branch organ responsibilities conflict with property commte  and local with
central agencies. For example, branch mnistries are effecdvely exercising the state's
owneship rights except that SPC has the exclusive right to dispose of state property.
This latter right relates not only to the stae enterprise itself (fthrough privatizaton) but
also to the disposal of individual assets. This is the cause of some confasion and erodes
enterprise managers autonomy, but is important for SPC to prevent asset stripping.
Moreover, the respective roles of the Ministry of Finance, SPC, other mistries, and
enteprise organs are unclear with regard to dividend policy. For example, the state as
shaeholder is supposed to decide on "net profit" rather than on "dividends", and the
dividend policy is not meant to be proposed to the shreholders by the organ responsible
for the enterprise (the supervisory council) as is the case in market economies. In some
rgions the situation regarding incorporation of state enterprises as joint stock companies
is unclear. This reflects that fact that propety committees at cent  and local leves bave
not yet established proper stures and systems to effectively exercise SPC's ownership
role.
e. In a market economy, owners receive profit-related dividends, use them to reinvest in
enterpnses where such capital invest  promises the highst retums. In Kazastan, by
contrast, the State, as owner, does not receive dividends. Hence enterprises use any
profits they make without regard to rer  on investment, using such profits for
employee benefits, social or private uses. The system of taMes and subsidies is not an
adequate proxy for dividends and capital iucres and is not organized in a sufficiently
rational manner to approximate to it.
4.        A program to improve corporate governance of SOEs will have to include the following
elements:
a. Coxorzaol of state enrprises as State-owned joint stock companies. Tbis is
adreed by the Mass Cotporatizaon and Mas Privatzato Componet of this loan.
Corporatization will clarify the prperty rights, legal status and authority of the
enterprises and will introduce supervisory councils (in Westem terms: the Board of
Directors) into enterprises to represent the interesvs of the owners (in this case, the State).
b. A system of           h                supba        oD  _O. This wil
involve improvement in mngment infomation, accounet  poicies and pracdces;



44-                                 Art= I-C
pppriae fnial reporing formats; vercation of repos through professloW
independent externl audits; the systematic collection and recording of key managment
information by the Stat'es ownrship agency (SPC); the rotine    of operational
and financial performance on the basis mainly of that data; and guidelines on nenives to
be provided to managers to enhan  financial performance. This system will help the
members of the eepise supervisory councils to perform their function ad allow the
Ministry of Finance, SPC and holding companies under SPC to decide on dividends and
capital ijectlons.
c. A rational                      for ivid s a d treNnvqwt whereby decisions on the
reallocation of capital between fims with different prospects, levels of unertinty and
capital needs will bave to be taken at holding company level and, possibly in a few cases,
at a higher level. Such decisions will also have to be taken within the context of the
Goverment's overall public invesument progra and budge. This will require
commercial business planing concepts to be htroduced with emphasis on realistic
_assessmm of cash flows, the adequac of retuns on investen  and selection of
priorities when there are competng demands for limited capital resources.
d.    C     l   ob          betwem state and gries. State demnds for production
of unprofitable items, sale of production at below market price and/or provision of non-
commrcial services as wel as re ments to comply with special rulatory legilation
shoud be explicidy fomlulated; agreed with the mnagement of the enterprise, possibly
on a contud basis; assessed as to the financial impact of such demands on the firm;
and        d  by Govenment through explicit payments (subsidies) on a
predetermined basis. For the most important SOEs (such as the utilities, ommunica
an railroad companies) this might take the form of so-called "performance contrct" on
an amnal or multi-year basis. Similar contractual arngemen  could also be used after
the privadzation of such firma.
e.             of o rZr     ad q o oep ge                         The toles of
the branch, property and financial agencies, on the republican and local level, need to be
clarified. The SPC, as designated reprsnave of State ownership interests, will have to
orgnize and train staff adequately to fulfil its role. To further improve its role in view of
the large numbr  of SOBs involved, SPC is to begi establishin tempoy holding
companies under itself which will be designed to be profit-orientated and more business-
lke than a State agency and which will pay competitive salaries to attract highdy skilled
local and foreign financial specialists. The members of the supervisory councils of te
holding compan es will need appropre traning and guidUnes to carry out their new
duties.

CAPACITY BUILDING FOR                           UG
A. BACKGROUND
1.           Iaz n's economy is undergoing a rapid transition from central planning, state
ownerhip, and high specialization within the integra  USSR market to decentral market
mechanisms, private ownership, and normal international trade relations. In the course of this
transition eneprises have to adjust in many profound ways to entiry dfferet relative prices; new
sets of coWetitors, supliers, and clients; new ownership structures and governance mhanisms;
new labor reations and mangement styles; a diffent legal framework and fun ally different
kinds of rlations betwee erp , and between enteprises and the Go-,ernment.
2.           This traisformation in their envirofnent will, in turn, eventually require aeerprises
to undertae major changs  in many of their own structur features: Ownersi, financing, internal
o     ation,  n _,mament, staffing, target markets, product mix, distribution arrangements,
techologies, production facilities, and so forth. The resr ing of these conurons differs in
nature, with implicadons for their tming and feasibility:
(*i)   Some of these strucues (e.g., the intermal organizatio and <ie maagement team)
can be changed at relatively litde fmancial cost.
(ii)   Other stuctura changes involve the resolution or trnfer of certan liabilidtes such as
fnancial debts, severance payments to excess labor, or clean-up cost and contingt
liaiities of past evionmea pollution.
(iii)   The thW category of strucul changes involves nestmens in new assets,
epecially equp    but dls distibution chanes, technologies, hun skills, market
reputation, and so forth
3.           The need for some major adjustments is by now felt strongly by most enterprises; in
Kazakhstan. The financial stats and the viability of SOEs are acaly not well known, due to
weakmesses in accountn and stati, high infation, long delays in inte-republican paymens,
enmous implicit subsidies in the price of credit and energy and rapid changes in the economic
enviroment. Undl end 1992, most state-owned enterprises (SOEs) reported profits, but a susanti
portion of all SOEs were illiquid, and many strted to appear economically non-viable. By mid 1993,
an increasing number is now allegedly incurring losses; the liquidity problems have severely
aggravated; and a large number of SOEs can be expected to become insolvent once energy prices
reach in   ional levels and interest rates become positive in real terms.
4.           Yet, so far only Ihmited rtuctuing has taken place. In pardtlar, few non-viable
facilities and opertions have been weeded out or tuned around. Significant restuctmng to succeed
requires several conditions to be in plae:



-48-                                Arx l-D
(i)    Strog prce sigials reasonably reliable expecao  about the futur envoment and
a minimum stabilit in the macro-economic environmet;
(ii)   an adequae incentive stucture for the enterprise and their managers, thro
profit-oriented owners, effective goverance mechwim, capable and rigorous
creditors, and hard budget consrains imposed by the Govenment;
(ifl)   adequate information, know how and sills to plan and implement ruuring
espcially an the part of managerS, possibly haned by training, techicd advice,
and sub sector sdias; and (iv) availabflity of, and - whee justfied - access to, the
necessary financal and other resources to implement the restuctuing, and to remain
liquid untl it brigs results.
S.           The creation of these conditions will remain a key trs of the authries, and warrant
strong support of foreign donors. So far, the efforts of the Kazakh Government have focused on
preparig impvement on conditions (i) and (ii), and implementation of these improvements has
started. In the comig months, increasing attention will need to be given to cond s (iii) and (iv).
6.           A more pro-active role of the state in resucting on the entetprise level i in most
cas  not justified. In view of the need for adequate icentives for restriuturing. substantial
restrucuin of enterpis  is in pimciple better left to the new owners after privatization.'  t should
aso be drivn by their creators, especially bank, provided they themselves are no-political, profit
oriented entities. Even enterpis  that are already insolvent or illiquid would best first put for sale
under the privatzaon program.
7.           Still, at least two instnce can be identfied where the state may need to play a more
active role in resttring.
(1)   In some medium or large enterprse most share may not be taken up in the
pivatiion auctions even at a symbolic price of one ruble or, rather, one investment
privatin  coupon, becas the investment funds (and other imvestors) believe that
these entrpis  bave a positive net present vale neither as a going concmn nor in
liquidaton. Some of these enterpries may warnt fi ial restuc4tu   and
perhs also the relief from excess staff, envronmental liabilites unfvorable
long-term conac, or particularly unattractve businesse before ftey are aga  put
on sale. Alternativdy, if they have very poor prospects indeed, they may need to be
closed down and the assets liquidated.
Il hle share majorty of up to 7,100 medium and large scale state enerpri  (200-5,000 employees)
are supposed to be included in the mm privatization progrm. These shares will be held direcdy
by the Stae Prperty Commit   until such time as those shares are uanfrred to the investment
fumds that parite in tie share auctions (with privadzation imvestment coupons that they
mobilize frm the ciize). Very large commercial SOEs (more than 5,00 employees) and SOEs
in cain specal sectors like enegy will not be hicluded in the mass p   progrm but
eveuly be privtized on a case-by-case basis as soon as the investor climate permits.



-49-                               Annex J-D
(ii)   Similarly, for a few highly complex and vey large etprises (with more than 5,000
employees) some active restrung may be warranted prior to privatiztion. In
paricar, they may need to be segmnted into smaler units, and spin off or close
social faciities and non-core businesses. Some preo-privatization restcturing may
also be needed in some enerprises in special sectors where privatiton has to await
of the regulatory framework, but where some restucBt    measures
can not be delayed accordingly. In either case, major new physical investe   should
sdll in general be ded to prior mplemtation of above defenive restruring
meaures as wel as to the implentaion of a concrete privatization plan.

8.           This project in conjunction with other componens of the Bank's Technical Assistance
LOa, will help prepare the ground for specific restructring activities in the medium term, some of
which may be supported with further Bank loans.
9.           This project would mainly help develop e nce in two citical steps: (i) Te
analysis of major under-performing enterprises with a view to deciding on the need or restructuring
(in conjction with privatization) and/or liquidation and (ii) the elaboration of detailed  trucring
and padzation plans for such very large enterprises. Both component would deal with a small
sample of frm, respecvely, on a pilot basis. The local leaning eerience should be multiplied by
condacdng the work joindy with substa   numbers of contrpar staff;  d     the results
widely in Kazakstan, regarding the methodology and other lessons leaned as they emerge from the
pilot exercises; an conductig training seminars on the methods and issues of their particular work,
as weil as of r    ig  actvities io general.
C. ASITANCE SMATEGY
10.          The contr  wil be awarded to one company ("the Cosultants"). The Consultants
may decide to carry out both sub-componen  in parallel, or on different dme schedules as agreed
with the Goverment and the Bank. Although there should be one person with overall responsibility
for fte entire conact, the two sub components mav be led by differt team leaders.
D. COUNTERPARTS AND DPEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
11.          The State Prperty Commitee ("SPC") represents the State as owner of all
state-owned entaprises and will. direcly or indirecldy, be the shareholder of all sares of SOEs
Iorpoted as joint stock companies undl their privatiton. For those enterpries that are not
eannrked for privaizaon in the near future, SPC has started establishing tempor   holdig
compaies, owned fuly or, in some case, in majority by SPC. This aims at facilitating the exercise
of the state's ownership role on a commercial basis with maxium operational autonomy and
financial accountability, in view of SPC's limited instituional capacity to efectve exercise this role
dectly in several hundred enterprises. Some holding companies are envisaged to be diversified and



-50-                                Annex IlD
other more specilid i paicular sectors. SPC will be the main counterpart agency of this project
[- to be confirmed prior to isuance of invitations to bid on this contract -1. For sub component
(ii) the consultants will likely word direcdy with one or two holding companies establshed under
SPC, but SPC remains their official counrprt.
12.          The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy are responsible for providing
financial support to state enteprises in certain ci. They will likely also play importa
roles in the establent, fumding, and supervision of special instiutions such a debt recovery fund
or bank, and a post-privatzation restuctring fund. The consutants will therore liaise closely with
these two asencs toughout their assignment.
13.          The Natiol Agency for Foreign Investment (NAFI) at the Ministry of Economy is
the coorditng agency for this project as part of the Bank's Teclhical Assistance Loan. The Project
mplementation Unit (PIU) for the Technical Assistace Loan, which is also located in this Agency,
will be responsibl for contractual and logistical arrangeme.
E. ACTIVTIES AND OUTPUTS
14.          The project will consist of two main ub-components.
Sub-Co nent (i): Review of the Rerting  Needs of 10-14 Very Large Egnteprises.
The Consultants will assist the rapid reiew of 10-14 very large enterprises (more than 5,000
employees) that appear to be substatially inefficient. This review shall assess which parts of these
entepris  are economically and financially viable (or can become viable through restuctring that
are economicaly efficient); what major resut    activities appear necessary and warranted, with
special attion to fiancial restrct ; and to which exn  such raeuctrig could be deferred
undl after pivatztion. Theses_       would thus also support the decisions of the state about
the potenal transfer of the bank loans of these enerprises to a special debt recoverer fund or bank.
SubComponent (ii): Elaboration of Pilot Restruur   Plan for 2 Large Enterrises
The ConsDltants would assist SPC, or holding companies owned by SPC, in the elaboration of
pilot restrucuing and privatization plans; for 2 very large enrpris  One plan will be established for
an enterprise that will likely require mainly liquidation of a large part of its businesses and facilities.
The second plan will deal with an enterprise that will likely warant s 1untial resctring to reach
efficiency. Thi restuctg plan woudd take into account the possibility to combine resructnng
with priaion; the plan would thus serve as part of the preparaton of the fim for privatization.
15.          Each of two sub-assignments (i and ii) would be conducted by groups consisting of
Consltant team member and sItff from the main Govermment insions and SPC-owned holding
compaes as mentioned above. The methodology used, key issues that emerge during the pilot
eaercises, and some case examples would be laid down in reports and other materials for
dissenation among relevant govenmt agncies and SPC-owned holding companies. The
Consultants on each of the two sub-components would also conduct bref infonnal workshops for their



-51-                               Annex I-D
counterpart institutions, and one final semnar (which can combine both su) fr a lre
audience towards the end of their assignments.
F. REPORTING
16.          The Consultants wiUl first submit a draft inception report on the two contr  sub
components, respecdtvely, in draft form to the main counrpa  agency and to the Bank within one
month after the agreed starting date of the respective assistance conent. After clearing and
potential revisions, the final inception report shall be distributed as outlied below. The two inception
reports can of course be combined into one report if tming permits. The inception report would,
inter alia, refine the proposed methodology; propose the samples of enterpris  subject to the
assistane; clafy information  qirements that the authorities and the enterprises can be reasonably
expected to fulfill in anticipation of and during the assistance; and propose a much refind tmetable
of activities.
17.         In case a contract sub component extends over more than 5 months of elpe time,
the Consultants will submit a mid-term progress reports in brief informal style, concentrating mainly
on past and planned activities ad iputs, contributions to the project objectives, and problem
encountered and remedies intrduced or proposed.
18.          Within no more than six weeks after completing the field work on the respective sub
component, the Consultants will submit a draft final report on their findigs and rec ons
relatng to this contract sub component. The final version will be provided no later than three weeks
after receiving comments from the Goverment and the Bank. Detailed entepriseecific inrmation
shall be presnted in a sepaate annex to safeguard coidenialit. The reports slall be submited to
SPC, NAFI, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, and - as appropriate in view of the
enterp       analyzed - branch minitries in each case in 2 Russian and 1 English copy, as well as to
the Bank (1 Russian 2 English copies) .
19.          The Consultants will be selected on the basis of their proposal, the qualications of
the firm, the qualification of the Project Manager and potential fAther leaders of sub cmponnt,
and the other team members. The team members dws d have extensive proven experdse in enterprise
restrcturig, with a subnl exposure to resructuin in formerly socialist economies, especially
Eastern Europe and the CIS. Familiart with the Russian, Kazakh, andlor Turkish lngua   would
be very useful for the assignment.
EL INPUTS
20.          The consultant contract will cover:
fees including overhead;travel, accdtion, and living e n;
project-related coication, report distution, and office supplies; and
translation, interpretaion, and Englila ge secretial support.



-52-                                Amnex I-D
Given the lack of residen advisor under this project; and instead the reliance on shorter-term
expet visits to KaXamtan, the contract does not envisage the purdae of office equipment for
conutant use.
21.          TI Govenment will make available to the consultants:
*      ssistance in the arrangement of housing, hotel rooms, visas, and trave;
*       ussian-language isecretarial support;
     data and legal texts as requeted by the consultants and required for carrying out their

photocopy and facsimile services.
22.          The conta  with the consutants will amount to no more than US$ 450,000. Also
Included in the Loa component, but not in the consultant conact, is a contingency of US$ 50,000
that can be used flexbly by the Countepart agencies in agreement with NAFI/PIU, subject to
agree_me by the Bank.

TERMS OF IEFERENCE
ANTIMONOPOLY AND COMPETITION POLICIES
A. BACKGROUND
1.           The economy of the Republic of Kazakhstan has inherited an industrial structure
aaci   by sclization and concentron in production and trade, with often only one
domesdc supplier or buyer in a market. Large state-owned enterprises employing over 500 people,
thoug consttug only one-fifth of the total number of industrial enterprises, account for 83 pet
of prodon volume and 89 percent of fixed asset values. In addition to large single enterprises,
group strucures often based on fonuer subsector ministries, intially referred to as industrial
"concen" and  s        y refered to as joint stock companies and holding companies, create the
potal for caroel-libe met agre _ and thraten the development of increased market
competition. As state-owned assets are privatized, it will be important that public monopolies do not
merely become pvte monopolies. Absent sufficient competition, prices will neither play their
critial informational role for resource allocation nor provide incentives for cost reduction and
innovation.
2.           In an effort to control abuses of monopoly power and promote competition, the
Republic of Kazlkutan enacted its first competition law, "Law on the Promotion of Competition and
Restrictions on Monopolistic Activity" in June 1991. The law is intended to break-up monopoly
enterpris  with a dominatin position if feasible, to regulate remaining monopolies, and to support
taning and the creaion of new enterprises. To permit the authorities responsible for implementing
the law to focus resources on the primary goal of creating and maintaining competition, the original
fnion assocated wid training and the promotion of new economic structure were removed in
Janmy 1993. I line with these chages, the enforcement authorities were renamed
"Sate Committe on Anti-Monopoly Policy" (SCAMP).
3.           Since the adoption of the price liberalization decree at the beginning of 1992, prices
of many products ave increased dramatically; through 1992 and the first quarter of 1993, price
indices of some goods have increased by 2,200 percent. In response, SCAMP has spent a
consderable amount of time and resources compiling a formal Register of monopoly enterprises, both
at the republican (cental, natiowide) and territoia (oblast) levels. According to the law, aU
enterpris  that produce more than 35 pemen of "like goods" are included on the Register; though
there is an awarenss tht sales would be the approprite vaiable, lack of detailed information on
Imp    and exports has led to a focus on production. The Register of monopoly enterprises compiled
by SCAMP is then used by the price committee (under the Mistry of Economy) to control profit
levels. In addition, a recent decree of the Council of Ministers has reintroduced the requirement for
enerpaiss to flfill state orders, tis time limited to enterprises on the Register. From a public
relations point of view, SCAW receives any bad publicity associated with the Register.



-55-                                Annex I-E
4.           It is critical, in the current environe, that SCAMP change stategic direcdon and
focus on the enhanement of competitve makt forces, rather than the selection of "dominant"
enerprises to be subject for govermment price regulation. SCAMP, both at the republican ad
territorial levels, has already taken a number of positive actions in this direction, in pardcular in
overtig decisions of other govemnental bodis that restrict competition. However, the
enhancement of competitive maket forces also requres more atention to collusive arrangements
between competing firms, more active participation in deconcentation opportmties during
privatization, and the development of guidelines governing both the behavior of domint firms and
the control of mergers. Policy priorities and transparent procedures to implement these priorities
need to be developed, together with a rnmber of visible prosecutions withubnti penalties, to
create an environment where undesirable conduct is deterred.
5.           As with many of Kazakbstan's new institutions, SCAMP remai_  understafed. While
there are 80 full-dme staff positions at the centrl office and staff positions for the 21 territorial
offices have been increased from 90 to 200, there are only about 60 people currently employed in the
central office and less than 100 throughout the territorial offices. The staff, as well as the suppordng
legal institudons, lack much of the technical know-how needed to take all the actions mandated by the
law. SCAMP needs to increase its economic expert in the area of mariet analysis ad competition
policy. The offices themselves also functon under severe resouroe constaits, with only six
computers in the central office and another six troughout all the terrtorial offices; the entire central
and territorial office network together only has one fax machine. It wil be important to create a
more stimlat  enviroment to attract the most competent staff possible, and to diuade the most
able existing staff from leaving.
6.           In addition to inadequa  working coiations, SCAMP also lacks the support and
understanding of many high-ranking government and puliamentay officials. Desirable revisions to
the original law, for example, have not yet been passed by Parliament. Tensions also exist between
the territorial SCAMP offices and the respective heads of teritorial or local  nista. in all
such areas, it will be easier fo: SCAMP to focus actvely on the   aof cometitive market
forces if cou part officials and all ckizeos understad why implemenation of the antimonopoly law
is in the interest of al consumers in Kazakhsan.
B. OBJECTIVES
7.           The objectives of this Project are to assist SCAMP, both at the republican and
territorial levels, by:
*     creaton of a aparet instional framework to enforce actively the exising
animonopoly legislation, through the stig up of clear policy priorities and
guidelis;
*     increasing the analydcal capabilities of SCAMP officials, and providig them with
practical methodologis that are appropridate for the speci conditions of Kazakhtan
*     upgrading the office eument available to SCAMP officials, to incrase
communication between central and republican offices, to allow available information



-56-                                Anmex I-E
to be used to implement the provisions of the antimonopoly law more effectdvely, and
to facilitate self-training throughout all SCAMP offices;
*     enhancing the awareness of high-rang govemnm   and parliamentary officials of
the benefits of a well-enforced, effective competon law.
8.           This work shall be carried out in a manner contributing to the overall general
objectives of competition policy, namely the enhanement of competitive market forces in the
Kazkbstan economy in order to promote economic efficiency and to inaease conumer wellbeing.
C. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
9.           The assistance will extend over an 18 months period starting in August 1993. The
inputs of the consultants are expected to be provided over the duration of loan effectiveness.
10.         It is suggested that the contract for this component be sbdivided into three
interrelated subcomponents:
i)  advice on office automaion;
(ii)   etensive training in the Republic of Kazakhstan, focused on the specific
current and longer-term issues of competition policy in Kazakstan;
(iii) some trainin outside the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The contract will be awarded to one general contractor. Not included in the contact but also funded
under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan, with disbursement direcdy thrugh the Project
Implementaion Unit, are travel expenses related to aendance of some foreign semiars, and the
procurement of office equWpment.
11.          Traiing will be the most important element of the assistance and, wherever possible,
will be provided with the objective of making the most effective use of office aomation equipme
(including hardware and software).
12.         It is envisaged that training on the tewritory of the Republic of Kazkhstan would
involve the arrival in Kazakhta of two foreign eperts for an in-th tree-week asessent of the
exst  and desired fture competition policy framework and the specific program that SCAMP is
likely to pursue to meet its policy priorities, including the visit of selected monopoly enterprise and
three teritorial antimonopoly offices. On the basis of an agreed desirable policy framework and
specific progam, the experts would evaluate offlce automadon quipment needs and training needs, to
enure that the specific eqpme  and training provided are responsive to the practical operaional
requirements of SCAMP. Initial on-site ppaion for the first traning cluster would also take place
during the first three-week visit, to ensure that subsequent traning is tailored to local condt .
Two experts would subsequenty return periodically to deliver five separate four-week training
clusters". Each trainig cluster would involve two repeated one-week seminars to SCAMP officials
on a selected themadc topic (each for roughly 25 officials, including one re ve from each of



-57-                                Annex I-E
the teritorial offices and the remainder from the cenral office), a number of short presentations to
high gove_rnt officials, and identification and preparation of the next cluster. Each taing cluster
idealy should be geared to identified priority areas for antimonopoly law implementaton, with the
objective of leading to subequent specific actions by SCAMP in these areas. The total consultant
time for this training component is expected to be 46 person-weeks (2 experts at 3 person-weeks each
for the initial assessment, followed by 2 experts at 20 person-weeks each for the five thematic training
clusters).
13.          It is envisaged that training outside the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan would
include the placement of six SCAMP officials in competition law enforcment offices in westem
ustialzed countries for a period of eight weeks. Trainers would be responsible for selecting
intrs among the best or most advanced SCAMP "trainees". It is suggested that these interns be
placed in pairs in receptive host country competition offices (such as 2 in Canada or U.S.A.,
2 in Germany, 2 in U.K.). It will be essenal that selected interns speak the lnguage of the host
country where they will be placed, to be confirmed on the basis of alanguage exam such as TOEFL
for English. Training outside Kaakhstan would also include attendance of three people at OECD and
EC competition policy training seminars (3 times a year for a 2-year period for the Vienna seinar
series, 2 times a year for a 2-year period for the Brussels seminars, if available). The costs related to
this travel to Viemna and Brussels are not part of this Consultant Contact.
D. COUNTERPARTS AND I APLENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
14.          The coordnat  agency for this Project, as part of the Bank's Tchnical Assistance
LA1n, is the National Agency for Foreign Investent at the Ministry of Economy of the Republic of
Kazan. The Project Implementation Unit for the Technical Assistance Loan, which is also
loceed in this Agency, will be responsible for contracual and logistical arrangements.
E. ACIVITIES AND OUTPUTS
1S.          The consultants will provide assistance to SCAM  on the following elements of the
antimonopoly and competition policy component:
Subcomponent (i): Advice on office automatioa
This subcoponent of the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan will fund up to
US$100,000 of office equipment for the central and terrtorial SCAMP offices (such as personal
computers, printers, modems, scanners, copying machines, fax machines, overhead projectots for
tring), subject to an assessment of equipment needs in line with the competition policy prora  to
be pusued by SCAM. This aemen is to be conducted by the Consultants during their first visit
to Kazakhst. Purase of equpment will not be part of the consultant contract, and will follow
sricy competitive Bank procuemet procedus.
Subcomponent (ii): Trainin on the territory of the Republic of Kanzahst
Training of SCAMP officials:
a.    prepare and deliver five training clusters, each consisting of two sets of very



-58-                                Annex I-E
practical-oriented, "hands-on" week-long seminar given -o a total of 50 SCAMP
officials (roughly 25 trainees per week-long semiar), on a variety of identified
thematic topics critical for effective andmonopoly law implementation (such as
demonopolization, enforcement of prohibitions against horizont and vertical
a    _eements, merger control enforement, control of abuse of dominant position,
enforcement of unfair competition/consumer protecdon provisions);
b.    coordinate the delivery of seminars with training on the effective use of office
equipment and available market databases;
c.    prov.de materials/maals on "how to" conduct analysis in the idendfied thematic
areas, that are tailored to the conditions and information available in KaXatn
(iitially, provision of one very relevant textbook or a compiladon of relevant articles
covering basic principles of competition theory and policy, tansated into Russian,
may be desirable).
Training of other high-randng government officials:
a.    prepare and deliver a series of short (possibly half-day or oneday) presenations on a
variety of idenified topics related to antimonopoly law Implementaton, in areas
where government or parlia y unetdg and support is desirable.
Subcomponn (iii): TraIn  outside the territory of the Republic of l;an
Intemships in foreign competition offices:
a.    select most competent officials from various SCAMP offices, based on performance in
seminars and other announced crteria
b.    identify willing host western industrialized country competion enforcement offices
and arrange for internhips;
c.    coordinate selected SCABP officials' travel and a mmodation idneraries.
Attendance at OBCD/EC-sponsored foreign seminas:
Funding will be proviled through the Project Implemtation Unit, and not as part of this
consultant contract, for trave expenses to permit SCAMP officials to attend the OECD competidon
law and policy seminar series held in Vienna, and the possible ECsponsored competition law and
policy semiar series that may be held in Brssels.
F. REPORTING
16.          The consultants will submit a series of Project reports, following each visk to
Kazakhsta. All reports shall be submittd to the Goverment (NAFI, SCAMP, and other agencies as
may be requested by the Government) in a total of at least four Russian language and two English
langae copies; and to the Bank in two 13nglish copies. These reports shali be briefs in informal
style. All such reports will enumerate and dscribe briefly the inputs, acdvities and outputs of the
last period; the contribution to the project objectives; the problems encountered, remedies sought, and



-59-                                 Annex l-E
further remedies proposed; the detailed plans for the coming period; any suggested changes to the
plans for subsequent periods; and miscellaneous further issues. The reports widl annex all distributed
seminar materials.
17.          The Project reports shall include: (i) an inception report following the first three-week
assessment of raining needs and specific office equipment needs; (ii) separate reports following
delivery of the first four training clusters; (iii) a final report following delivery of the fif training
cluster.
G. CONSULTANT QUALIFICATIONS
18.          The consultant team ideally will be composed of a small number of experts to provide
training in the territory of the Republic of Knakhst  (perhaps only two  training experts"). To
ensure contiuity and familiarity with the conditions within the Republic of Kazakhstan, it would be
desirable for the same trining experts to be involved in the delivery of subsequet training clusters.
19.          It is essential that training experts have demonstrable first-hand familiaity with the
workin  of an antimonopoly/competition law enforcement office in a well-functioning market
economy, acc_uuated over a nmber of years (not less than five years). At least one, and preferably
atl training experts should be fluent in Russian and be knowledgeable in some industrial structure and
conduct characterisdcs of ecovomies of the former Soviet Union. Ideally, one of the training experts
should be familia with the setting up of an antimonoly/competiuion law enforcement office and be
qualified to asss all relevant equipme  needs.

ECNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN
T1MS OF REFERENCE
INSTITUTIONAL DEVLOPMNT OF TH E NATIONAL AGENCY FOR
FOREIGN INVESTMET IN FOREIGN INVESTM  POLICY AND PROMOnON
A. BACKGROUND
1.           K    tan wishes to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) as part of an overall
nacro-economic policy aimed at private sector led economic grwth. While foreign investors have so
.ar shown most interest in KazaMhstan's hydrocabors and mmerals sectors, the Government
envisages a substantial role of FDI also in sectors such as agro-processing, export-oriented
manufacturing, and commications. FDI has been invited to all sectors of the economy, except for
those involving the manufcture of weapons. Kazakhstan's general policy attitude to PDI can be said
to be generally open and encouraging.
2.           An initial legislative program of imvestment protection and nucentives has been
intoduced over the last two years. Exemptions from customs duties and export/import licenses, tax
holidays, liberal visa requrements and other benefts are provided. BLateral investment treaties have
been signed with counties like France, Germany, and the VJnited States. General economic
legislation regring property, companies, banking, etc. has been developed at rapid pace as well.
Still, subtl further improvements in the specific and general legal framework for foreign
investment are envisaged. A new foreign investment law has been developed and shall be submitted
to the autumn session of parliament.
3.           To promote and regulate FDI, the National Agency for Foreign Investment (NAFI)
has been created in late 1992. It is part of the Ministry of Economy. The NAFI Chairman is the
First Vice Minister of said ministry. NAFI has currenly 14 staff engaged in two units (foreign
inestment in the energy sector, and in other sectors), under one of three NAPI Deputy Chairmn. In
addition to foreign investment, NAFI is in charge of codiating foreign aid and debt. Most staff of
NAFI has been recruited only within the last months. The detailed organization, policies, and
procedures o, NAFI are still being developed, as do the specific relevant skills of its staff.
B. OBJCIVES
4.           The objecties of this technical assistance project are to develop the instiutional
capabilities of NAFP's foreign invet  units through various forms of formal and on-the-job
training and though practical assistance, particularly in the following areas:
*     furfher development of the forign investment regime, includig policy formlation,
development and implementtion of specific legislaion, and investment protection
arrangements. This would include also an analysis of options to mobilize foreign
portfolio invesbmeit for Kazakhstan's economy, and an analysis of potenta sources of
financig and insurance accessible to foreign investnents in Kazakhstan;



-63-                                Annex I-F
*     the handling of individual foreign investment cases through negotiatons (mainly
where naural resources or other state ppety are involved), and through the
monitoring of their compliance with regulations an Wreements;
*     promotion of foreig investment through formulation and inidal implemention of a
FDI promotion strey   and campaigns, and through development of adque
materias.
C. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
5.           The assistance will extend over a perod of fifteen months, starting in August 1993.
The conact will be funded under the Tecnical Assistance Loan of the Bank to the Republic of
Kakbstan. This Loan has been araised and techically negotiated, and is scheduled for Board
presentaton on August S. The total Loan is proposed to amount to US$38 million equivalent. It is
designed to support a wide range of policies and insiuons, including privadzation, prvate sector
development, financial sector reform, improveme  in the social safety net, and various taning
acivities.
6.           The contract shall be awarded to one conactor (the Consutant). It is suggested that
the consultant team consist of one pemanen resident advisor and team leader, two furter long-term
advisors (on foreign investment promotion and negotiaon, respectively), and vanous experts for
shorer assimens.
7.           The project can be seen as consisting of three main components, with the tming and
person-months suggested as follows:
(i)   foreig investment regie: about 10-12 persoonths stardng August 1993;
(ii)   foreign investment  goations and monitoring: about 6-8 pasn s starting
Septmber 1993; and
(iii)   foreign investment promotion: about 8-10 psn   with initial activities starting
in October/November 1993.
8.           Under the same Bank Loan, a range of relad TA activities will be carried out
conurreny. For example, assistac will be provided to NAFI and specific branch ministres in the
particular area of foreign investment negotiations and taxation in the mining sector; to the State
Ptoperty Committee in prvataion; to the Anti-Monopoly Committee in competition policy; and to
legal institutions in legal dafting and the organization of the legal system. Moreover, the Bank is
preparing a Loan in the energy brandch that is envisaged to include further specific assistance to
forein investment negotitions and taxation in the energy sector. Obviously the assistance provided
by the Consultants needs to be well coordinated with these activities. In paricular, any legal maters
under this assignment shall be closely coordinaed with the TA component on legal reform under the
same Bank Technical Assistace Loan.

TECHNMCAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPM  m
MINING AND METALLURGY SECTOR
1.           The technical assistae provided by the loan for the mining and metallurgy sector is
intended to assist the govemment in establishing an internationally competitive legal, regulatory, and
fiscal environment necessary to promote private sector development of the sector. In addition, it is
designed to provide assistance in strengthening governent institutions responsible for supervising the
sector as well as training government officials in administering the regulations.
2.           The technical assistance project is sub-divided into four distinct sub-components.
Preferably, overall implementation of the technical assistance for this sector should be given to a
single conswlting organization (or consortium of organizations) in order to simplify adminisation.
Alternatively, separate consulting groups may be selected to implement each sub-component (or
combination thereof) but this would be more difficult to administer.

3.           Projdct Objetves
a.      Prepare a clear stam     of govermen policies and objectives in respect of mineas
sector development, including measures to attrat foreign invetment;
b.      Devise a consistent Saeg  to implement the policies and achieve the objectives and
an Action Plan (short and long term) for the government to follow, including the
programming of futier technical assistance to the sector;
c.      Sitize and educate key govenmment officials in the dynamics and operations of the
sector under conditions of the market economy.
4.           Project Ratioale. Atract  investment to the minerals sector, especially from
foreign sources, is very difficult given the keen competition for the available sources of funding. The
government is well aware that it must provide for an interationally competive invesment
environent and foster the developmen of the sector according to the principles of the market
economy. But, before it can draft laws and regulations, and fiscal mechanisms for the sector it must
decide up  the overall policies and objectives that will guide miling and metallurgical operations.
eaue   past management practices in respect of the sector reflected the command and control
philosophy of the previous system it is necessary for government and enterprise managers to study
and leam the principles of market economy practices in respect of minig and metallurgy, understand
the operatiom of the inteational metals industry against which Kazl san's production must
competeon world markets, and be aware of the concermn of foreig inveors as they evaluae
investnent oppornities. Therefore, a clear and complete statement of these policies together with a
cohrent strategy to achieve them is an essential pre-requisite to arcting and retainig privae sector
investment. This is particulrly the case with foreign investors who have remarked that the lack of
clear policies and objectives makes imvestidng in the sector significany more risky than in other
countries.
5.          Plroject Decrpto   A "Workdng Group" wil be established under the dcamanhip
of the National Agency for Foreign Investment which will conduct the dialogue. The Group will be

the National Ibstitute. The Working Group will be responsible for the draftig of the Stement of
Policies, the Sector Strateg, and the Action Plan. A series of workshops and/or seminars may be
conducted under the auspices of the Working Group for government and enterprise officials
responsible for supervision of the sector. These workshops wiUl be organized to provide a form for
discusion as well as to provide trn    to the officials in the principles of sector management in
accordance with the prece    of the market economy.  rtiur   atteion will be paid to exming
the types of policies whih have been adpted by other couties with whom Kaakstan must
conpete on international markets; the Consutants will lay out and examine wkh the Working Group
the various policy options that have been adopted elsewhere and which may provide guidance to the
Kazikhstan authorities.

Sub-Cmonent II: Mining Code. Regulations, and Model Investment Agreement
11.         IProject Objecdves.
(i)     Design, draft, and promulgate basic mineral development legislation (Mine Code);
(ii)   Design, draft, and promulgate enabling reuations to implement the Mine Code;



-74-                                Annex I-G
(iii)    Design and draft a "model investment agreement" which may be used by the
government in negotiations with private investors.
12.          Projed Raionale. The Mine Code in market economies is used to provide an
orderly system whereby mineal assets, which are the property of the state, can be granted on a
concessionary basis to commercial (and, in some instances, state) entities which desire to explore for
and exploit them. Seuity of tenure is cited by international mining companies as the single greatest
risk to be considered when investing outside of their hoenn countries. Mine codes normally provide
for security of tenure by leasing exploration and exploitation rights to companies for specified periods
of time. The company is then able to work the deposit and, in some cases, use the minin lease as
collateral for financing project development. Kazakhstan has taken some steps in the direction of
leasing mineral deposits to enterprises. However, in some respects the recendy passed law on sub-
soil resource does not provide sufficient clarity or security of tenure for the investor. In addition, the
law needs to be completed by complete mining regulations as well as a model investment agreements.
13.          Project Description. The project will provide internationally recognized legal and
rgulatory experts to design and draft basic mineral development legislation, regulations, and model
investment agreements. This legislation will be based upon the statement of policies and provide the
legal basis to attain the objectives and set forth in the sector strategy. The mine code will address
fundamental matters such as jurisdiction over resources, ownersip of mineral assets, exploration and
exploitation rights, obligations of the mine title holder to conduct works within specdfied time frames,
small scale mining, access to land, processing of minerals, storage and transport of commodities,
envirnmental protection measures, dispute resolution, offenses and penalties, and other matters. The
erablng regulations will frter detail the administive procedures to be followed in implementing
the mine code. Investment agreements will be designed to address issues of pertinence not addessed
in the code or reguions and which may be of specific interest to investors such as the provisions
relatng to foreign exchange, off-shore retention of sales proceeds, accountmg procedures and
standards, depreciation and depletion allowances, and others.
14.          It is proposed that the Consultants spend an initial 3-5 weeks in Kaakhstan to
iiniliarir themselves with existing legislation and to pardcipate in the dialogue on policies and
sttegies. At the end of this initial visit a preliminary report of findins will be submitted to the
govermment for review. Subsequenly, the consultants will return to home base to prepare drafts of
the laws, regulations and model investment agreements a d submit them to the Government and the
Bank for review. A second visit to Kaakhstan will be Jiade to follow up on the recommendations
and discuss the draft legislation with government authorities.
15.          Consultat Qualifat.
(i)     Licensed Attorney (2 man months) with an international reputaion for work in
mineral law and negotiations gained through at least 15-20 years experience with
private mining companies, public administative agenies for the sector, or private
law practice. He will be thoroughly cognizant of the currenly applicable and
proposed laws and regulations in Kazakbstan which may have a bearing on mineral
development including, but not limited to, the laws on foreign investment, the
concessions law, regulations for health, safety and environment, laws on
privadzation, taxation, labor laws, and existng mineral investment agreemenb, if

18.          Project Objecves.
(i)     Devise and develop internationally competitive mineral "rents" system (royalty,
surface rental, permit fees);
(ii)    Develop, in coordination with other government agencies, standard deductions and
methods of determining net income for mining enterprises;
(iii)    Train tax personnel in administration of tax policies and system.
19.          Project Ratonale. The rates and methods of calculation of tax liabilities pertaining
to mining/metallurgy operations is a critical variable considered by invest,vs. While mining should
be subject to the same general tax regime as applies to other industrial sectors, there are mining
specific taxes as well as methods of calculating income from minig operations that must be deised.
Generally, taxation of minera enterprises entails a "resource rent" in the form of a royalty on
production, fees for permit issuance and renal of surface areas, tax on profits, and tax on dividends.
In Kazakhstan at present these forms of taxation are relatively unknown and what taxes do exist are
highly detrimental (the export tax, for instance) to attracting investment. Adminis on of the tax
system is very undeveloped as well. Therefore, the rationale for this project is to develop a
competitive tax regine and to strengthen the government institutions in charge of assessing and
collectng the taxes due.
20.           Project Description. The project will provide both short term mnd resident techmical
assistance by experts in mining taxation and resource rents. These experts will work primarily with
the Ministries having overall responsibility for supervision of the sector (Ministres of Geology and/or
Industry. Emphasis will be given at all stages to designing a tax regime that is competitive by
intemational atandards. The Consultants will assist, on both a short-term and resident periods, these
ministries to:
(i)     devise an appropriate royalty stucre for minerals and establish the basis upon
which the royalty is to be calculated;
(ii)    determine the fees to be charged for permit issuance and surface rentals;
(iii)    establish the methods and procedures of assessment and payment of fees, rents, and
royalties; and

and collect the fees and royalties.
The consultants will also work, secondarfly, with the Ministry of Finance or otier governmen
agency in charge of general taxation mas. Consltancy services will assist the Ministry to:
(i)     devise appropriate rates for assmn  of income and dividend taxes;
(ii)    provide advice on international standards for depreciation rates for capital equipment,
depletion allowances, customs and entry duties, and incentives to be offered (if any);

25.           Projet Ratione. Pro    mineral legislation and competitive tax regimes wil be of
value to atactdg investors only if they re administered in a professional and   nsparent manmer by
appropriate government superisory institutions. Most market economy coumtries find that the
intests of the sector are 'Aest served if the goverment institutions serve as: (i) policy maker for the
sector, (ii) evaluator of mineral potental and wealth, (iii) regulator of minerals development, and
(iv) repesentative of the government (or advisor to other govremment bodies) in cetain ivestment
(forein) negotiaons. The absence of govenmet instions to fulfill these functions, which is
presently the case in Kazakhstan, means that potential investors do not know with whom to deal. The
creation and t         of these institutions is thus est  if the government is to exert effective
contol over the country's wustanl  mineral resources.
26.           Project Desciption. The project will provide experdse by consultan  having
international experience with institutions in dharge of supervising mining sectors. These institutions
are typically conained in a cetal mistry responsible for the sector (Ministry of Mines) which has
distnct d         for specific fimctions:
(i)     a mines departmen to issue licenses and permits, maintain the cadastre registry,
monitor compliance with health, safety, ad environment standards;
(i)     a geological surey to conduct regional geology recon     and mapping, basic
research into the earth sciences, etc.;
(iii)    one or more laboratories and research facilities;
(iv)    a deparmen of environmental standards and protection; and
(v)     a mineral deposit promotion office to attract investment.
The project will identify and delineate the functions and responsibilities of each deparm,
subdivisions within each agency, suggest staffing and recruitment schedies, set-up
adminisive and operain procedures, and train local persomel in these fimctions.
In pariular, the resident consultant will:

may re-calibrate exist  geology data using internationally accpted economic
parametes, digitize data and maps, and install a Georaphic Information System.
Primary emphasis of this system will be on geology and land use data though it may
serve as the basis for other applications. For this purpose, $100,000 is allocated for
the purchase of computer equip     and software.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
PAYMENTS SYSTEM, PHASE I
1.           An efficient payments system is vital to fostering competition and cooperation between
financial institutions as well as enuring reliable and timely customer services. In this regard, the
definition of settlemen standards and regulations has proven to be an effective mechanism in
facilitating foreign investmen  to develop the industrial infrastructure and support economic activities.
Some key operational objectives can be realized through short term improvements to the payments
system. These include:
(i)   informed liquidity management on part of the commercial bans. This could be
accomplished through account consolidations at the global level for each bank and
would minimize the high costs of refinancing and overdrafts on correspondent
acuounts at NBRK;
(ii)   redefinition of the reserve requirems to include the cash in vaults and to integrate
the blocked reserves with the banks' correspondent accounts at NBRK. The high
reserve ratio of 18 percent erodes incentve for deposit mobilization; the consolidation
of these balances would allow banks with a larger branch network (and consequenly
more cash in vaults) to compete more equitably with smaller branch networks;
(ii)  enhanced competition between banks through the establishment of settlement
regulations and dme frames and, again, consolidadon of correspondent account
balances. This would allow smaller banks more leverage in their decisioris on
obtining credits, and in the long term would support the establishment of an
nterbank market;
(iv)   comtied encouragement and support for the banks' in-house automation programs.
At a miimum, the larger banks should plan to forward netted positions to the NBRK
Clearing Centers and offer bilateral dearing facilities to the other banks whick are not
as advanced in their automation programs. This would reduce the current srains on
the NBRK payments system network.
2.           Transaction delys are due in part to an iadequate telecommunications infrastructure.
In addition, of nineteen clearing centers, only fifteen have installed mainames, while the remaining
four use mic     rs. In addidon to the clearing centers, there are 270 Cash Centers at the
District level. The Cash Centers lack an adequate automated processing capacity, and the need to use
courier/postd/teletype services for ransmission of data to the clearing centers contibute to the system
delays. Preseany, branch accounts are netted and cleared at the regional level. If there is insufficient
cover in an account, all debits on that account are frozen pending provision of finds or registration of
credits. There may be sufficient liquidity/reserve balances at other branches of the same bank, but
the present system does not consolidate settlement balances across regions and at the aggregated bank
level. This situation exacbat  financial risk management. The NBRK is addressing some of these
issues by consolidating settlement balances at least for the three regions in the Alma Ata area. This is
operadonal since early 1993 through electronic linkage of the three large centers . The Data



-80-                               Annex l-A
Processing Departmn of NBRK also plans to develop application software to consolidate balances
and perform account netfting at the regional levels.
3.           NBRK pursues a two-phased approach in its strategy to improve the operations of the
payments system. The first phase (to be fmanced under this Loan), would include short term
improvements which could be implemented in the near future. Simultaneously, work could
commence on the planning for, and design of, the long-term solution, which could be funded by the
proposed Financial and Enterprise Sector Development Loan.
4.           This Technical Assistance Loan would include the following sub-components:
Sub-Component (i) Implementation of the Interim Solution for the Payments System
(approximaely US$4,200,000):
(a)          Assistance to the Kazakhstan Association of Banks on Information Systems
and NBRK in identifying standards for payments instruments,
tasaction/identification numbering schematics, indicative time frames for clearings/
settlements at various processing levels, feasibility of bilateral clearng arrangements,
etc., and in coordinating the interim and long-term solutions of the payments system.
(b)          The installation of two microcomputers at each Cash Center. Accounting
software is being developed to assist in recording transactions, maintainin accounts,
and data entry for transmission of information to the regional ceters. Where
electronic linkages are not feasible, data could be transmitted on diskettes to reduce
the data entry efforts at the regional offices.
(c)          The instalation of two microcomputers at each of the regional clearing
Centers, together with high speed error correctig modems to facilitate electronic
connections on "noisy" telephone lines. The Data Processing department of NBRK
and/or the Kazakhstan Association of Banks on Information Systems should develop,
as a high priority, software to aggregate individual branch reserves/clearing balances
for each bank. The aggregation would be effected on the existing regional computers
and copied to the microcomputers which would maintain one consolidated baance for
each bank. This would allow each region to monitor such balances and, at the request
of the concerned bank, enact transfers from branch to branch as and when necesary
to provide cover. At the end of the processing cycle, these aggregate balances
(a maximm  of approximately 150 for any one region) should be transfnred to NBRK
headquarters for further aggregation by banks, i.e. one setdement balance per bank,
and maitenance of an interbank indebtedness matrix. Where electronic dat
transmission is still not possible, the teletype facility could be used for forwarding
aggregate balances from the regions. This scheme would facilitate financial risk
management, improve the velocity of money, and, reduce the float inherent in the
existing system.
(d)          The engagement by NBRK of a telecommunication specialist for a one month
study to produce tender documents for both the telecommnication eqpnt and the
assorted microcomputers.

Data processing) to two central ba  in Europe to investigate operational paymens
system modalities. Prospecdve countries could include Switzerland and France, and
the trip could be undertaken over a ten day period.
(t)          Installation of an iteational telecommunication connection for effective
correspondent banking, monitoring of money markets, and foreign exchange
trausactions.
Sub-Comoent (ii): Pparations for the Lone-Te_n Solution of the Payments System
(approiately US$400,000):
While the short term improvements are being implemented, NBRK would
commission a feasibility and design study for the long-term solution to the Payment
System. This study would address strategic issues related to the payments system and
financial risk management; institutional arrangements; technical standards; system
engineering; technical specifications; and implementation considerations. The study
would be expected to cmmence in early August, and would involve a sequence of six
reports covering these six areas, with the last report submitted some 7 mionths after
the start of the assignment.
Sub-Component (iii): Conmutiaon  of NBRK's Internal Accounting (approximately
US$1,000,000):
The Project would finance the software or software development, and
bardware as may be needed, to computeriz NBRK's internal accounting on the basis
of its new accounting system. The preparations are being assisted by the IMF and
Bank of France.
Sub-Component (iv): Computefization of the Processing of Commerci Banks' Reor
(approimately US$ 100,000):
The Project could finance stndard software, and its local adjustment, for
recording and analyzing the regular reports of bans to NBRK.
S.           SubComponents (i) - (iv) together would amount to approximately US$5,700,000.
Further US$300,000 would constitute a contingency amount. One potential use would be for a
feasibil  and design study of a service bureau network that would process the customs accounts of
participating commercial bank, including interbmanch clearing. NBRK would first seek gramnt
financn for this study, however. Implementtion of the service bureau network could be supported
by the Bank's prposed Finamncial and Enterprise Sectors Development Loan.

TERMS OF REFERENCE
FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES
OF THE TEN LARGEST BANKS
A. BACKGROUND
1.           The Government of Kazakhstan has started to anplement a number of economic,
monetary and legal reforms aimed at restructuring the economy. These reforms will induce a new
and more active role for banking institutions and call for the rapid development of an efficient
financial sector.
2.           However, most baning institutiors are in a very fragile financial situation and suffer
from mmerous operadonal weaknesses that nay impede them to fulfill efficiently their new
responsibilities of mobilizing and allocating resources in a competitive environment. These
weaknesses are related, in particular, to a general lack of autonomy in credit allocation and of
banking skills required in a market oriented environment. Also, the financial sector relies excessively
on central bank refinancing facilities. In general, there is an inadequate financial structure due to
distortions in interest rate policy, and to the poor quality of their loan portfolio.
3.           Within its overall program for developing the financial sector, the National Bank of
the Republic of Kazakn  (NBRK) has also initiated a number of actions aimed at reforming the
regulations of the sector, developing a new accounting plan for banks and building up its own
upervisry capacity.
4.           As part of the first phase of this banking sector reform, the Government of
Kazaktn  and the NBRK, responsible for the supervision of the sector, have decided to launch
comprehensive financial and operational diagnostic studies of the 10 largest banks in the country.
These studies will be undertaken in the context of the proposed World Bank "Technical Assistance
Projecta and will be carried-ut by experienced international consulting firms (hereafter referred to as
"the Consultant") selected through an international competitive bidding process.
B. OBJECTIVS
5.           The main objctves of the studies are: (i) to provide an accurate assessment of the
financial condions and operational capabilities of the banks, including their organization, policies,
and procedures; and (ii) to serve as a basis for undertaking, when required and warranted,
festrucudhg and sn     i  that address the major deficiencies of the banks, including their
recapitalization to suwitable levels in accordance with sound international banking practice.
6.           As part of this process, the Consultants should: (i) determine the financial and
operational viability of the nsttions, and their main strengths and weaknesses; (ii) recommend,
when required, sucural changes that may be necessary for the safety of the banking sector such as
merging, sliWng of activities between different legal entities, liquidation, etc.; and (iii) propose, for



-84-                               Annex Il-B
each bank, a global strategy and a detailed and prioritized action plan, including the estimate of
financial and human resources, and of the timneframe, reqWred to implement the program of reform
for each activity.
7.           The objective of this program of reforms is to set the banks in a position to be fully
audited, based on international standards, as of Decemnber 31, 1995, and to meet international banking
operational practices, at the latest, by the end of 1996.
C. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
8.           For efficiency and timeliness purposes, it is expected that the studies of some banks
will be carried out simultaneously by the same Consultant, with the exception of the studies of
Agroprom Bank, the agricultural credit agency, and Sber Bank, the state savings bank. For these
banks the Consultant contract will also include an analysis of the sectors in which they operate.
9.           It is therefore expected that five different consulting firms will be involved in this
program and that selected firms would make pross covering the following grouping:
Group A: Agroprom Bank
Group B: Sber Bank
Group C: Turan bank, Kazdor Bank
GrouP D: Alem Bank, Igilil Bank, Interinvest Bank
Group P: Kretsoc Bank, Kramds Bank, Center Bank
10.          The ConWultants would be expected to begin wo*k in the first half of August, 1993,
and to submit ther final report to the NBRK, the analyzed bank, and the World bank before the end
of December 1993. Te Consultants should also be prepared to make a presentation highlighting
major findings ando ns in December 1993.
D. COUNTERPARTS AND IMEMENTATION ARRANGED ENTS
11.          The coordinaing agency for this Project, as part of the Bank's Technical Assistance
Loan, is the Nadonal Agency for Foreign Investment at the Ministry of Economy. The Project
Implemention Unit for the Tecnical Assistance Lan, which is alo locaed in this agency, will be
responsible for cort      and logistical agemets. The bank undergoing these financial and
operational di ostic studies will establish counepat teams to work in close collaboration with the
ConlSUtants. The Consultants wil be epeced to seize this opportunity to provide the staff of the
bank with onthe-job traning, when required, in fincial and operadonal matters covered with these
studies.
12.          The forhcoming supervision departme  at NBRK will delegate one or two new staff
membrs to work with the Consultants' team in chawe of the studies of each bank in order for them
to benefit from a first exposure to international bank audiing practices and to act as liaisons with the
NBRK during the execuon of these sues.



-85-                               Annex Il-B
13.          The consultants will coordinate their work related to accounting and fiacial
management with NBRK departments in charge of the design and implementation of the new chart of
accounts for banking institutions and of prudential regulations. These studies should, in this context,
aim at preparing a step-by-step implementation plan of the new accounting system and at improving
the reliability of banks' reports related to prudential regulations. The Consultant will also take into
account the information technology capabilities of NBRK, the two-phased on-going reform of the
payment system and the potential computer and advisory svices that could be provided by the
Service Bureau Network envisaged by the Kazakh Association of Bns on Information Systems
located in NBRK. The impact of the Govemment's privatization program on the banks' capital and
on the governance of each bank will also be an important input in the design of recommend
individual strategies.
E. ACTIVITES ANID OUTPUTS
14.          The studies wil include a comprehensive financial and institutional review of the
banks, as detailed in the following paragrapbs. The recommlnded strategies should specifically
assess, for each bank, the option of focusing all its efforts to collect loan arrears through the design
and implementation of resucui  plans and debt work-o  arrangemes.
(I) Fiancia Dagosis
iS.          The Consultant is reqired to analyze the consolidated accounts of each bank and
express a conclusion on the financial condition of the bank a of June 30, 1993 (or if not feasible, as
of December 1992), and on the reported financial performance of the bank during the first half of
1993 (or if not feasible, during 1992).
16.          For this purpose, the Consultant has to adjust the available financial stments for the
review date in order to prduce a balanceet and the relatd samet of operations, retained
eamnings and changes in the finaial position of the bank in a fomut in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Standards for bank, taking into account the inflationay enviromnment of the
Kazakh economy.
17.          It is recognized that, owing to the presnt state of accountng and the economic
enomentin Kakbstan, some of the requirments of this first finaca  diagnosis will present the
consultants with a difficult task. In such cases, the coltams should use their judgement and are
expecte to state clealy which items cannot be sadshctorily awered or addressed in the present
study and what asumptions bave been cho to assess te repayment capacity of the borrowers. It
will therefore likely be necessary for the consultant to use two scenario to base the conclusion:
(i) assume the condnuation of the prent reform policy, wth sbsal macro-economic imbalances;
or (ii) assume an accelerion of the stabilization and stuctwu   adjustment policies, together with a
satisfactory solution to the present ilnter-cunty setlement difficulties. The scenados used by the
consultants must be dissed and refect conenu  with other cowna  conducting diaostic
studies in the other bas.
18.          The financial and portfolio digostic wil place patu  emphasis on the assment
of the qualit of the bank's portfolio, as of June 30, 1993, and will include a systematic waluation of



-86-                                Amex II-B
loans to large borrowers, and a sample evaluation of smaller loans. The evaluation will focus on the
financial viability of the large borrowers, and their capacity to repay loans. As part of the portfolio
analysis the consultants would evaluate at least the 10 largest risks in the portfolio, as well as a
sample of smaller risks, to cover a minimum of 70 percent of the loan portfolio by volunim, in the
limit of 100 individual evaluations. The portfolio analyses will include visits to a number of
significant borrowers whenever the information available at the bank's level is not felt to be sufficient
to enable the Consultant to carry out a proper assessment.
19.          In the course of undertaking the diagnosis the following items deserve particular
attention:
(i)    A portfolio assessment to determine the overall quality of the bank's loan portfolio
and the reasonableness of the bank's lending policies, practices, and procedures.
(ii)    An assessment of the adequacy of the existing level of provisions, and as appropriate,
recommendations for adjustments thereto.
(iii)   An evaluation of the adequacy of other valuation reserves, if any, and as appropriate,
recommendations for adjustments thereto.
(iv)   Analysis of concentation of credit risks (exposure) to determine the exte  to which a
few companies or a group of companies account for a luge proportion of the total
outstanding loans and/or loans and equity of the bank (e.g., 25 percent of the bank's
capital by industry and 5 percent of the Bank's capital for individual or connected
enterprises).
(v)    An analysis of the portfolio by: a) types of primary collateral (including guarante
and insurance); b) economic sector; and c) types of enMteprises, including enterprises'
shareholders, conned and independent from the bank; d) regions; e) ypes of
lending instruments; f) a breakdown of the portfolio by loans made under centalized
credit resources, other NBRK credit facilities, and the banks' own resources with a
distinction, for each category, between loans made under direct goverment
instion and those made at the bank's own discretion. For each category, the
amounts classified as problem loans and the percenage of each category extended at
subsdized rates should be specified.
(vi)   A      _  of the equity portfolio of the bank and the resonables of the values
reported on the balance sheet. This element will also have a bearing on the level of
provisions. In assessing the equity portfolio, particular atention should be given to the
bank's objectives and policies for making equity invesuments (e.g., whether to serve
as a catlyst for assisting client projects in attracting other equity investors, whether to
provide a more balanced capital stucture for the project entprse, a source of
income, or as a means of diversifying or com l   the bank's business activities
through a subsidiary/affiliate relationship). The realization of the objecdve/policy, as
well as the productivity of the equity portfolio should be assessed. The relaionship
(ratio) of total equity investments to the bank's own capital and the reasonbleness
thereof, must also be assessed.

(vii)  Asessment of reliability and composition of reported earing of the bank for the
review period, with special emphasis on the exten to which accued but uncollected
interest on non-performing loans is taken into income, and the relative shares of
ope g (iterest income ad expense, non-interest income and expense, taxes) and
non-operating income and expenses.
(viii) Breakdown and analysis of the operating costs of the bank, including coos and
benefits rlated to performing tasks or providing services for the account of naional
or local authorities.
(ix) An analysis of the bank's liquidity, and asset and liability management practices.
Attention should be given to interest rate and maturiy mimatches.
(x)    Analysis of the capital adequacy and of the componens of capital, dividend policy,
appropratios, and the ability of the bank to internally generate capital. Te adequacy
of capital should be evaluated in terms of the financial condition of the bank, the mix
of risk assets (including off-baance sheet  ,  fture growt ps, and the
quaty of magement.
(xi)   Assesment of the composition and strucue of the bank's asset, deposits and other
liabilities. Fixed assets are to be sparaty lied along with their value. Any

surpluses in the accomts should be ideified and adjst_me  made u  ppropriae.
Particular atention should be paid to the foreign exchange assets and liabilities which
consist of foreign exhange deposits, loans and interbank positions. Furthemore,
msets should be classified between income and nonincome geneating. All
outanding term borrowing should be idend  and broken down on a loan-by-loan
basi. In addition, the stucture and evolution of the internal and eterl float should
be analyzed in order to assess potental liquidty problems and hidden losss.
(xli)  Notes on each item of the adjusood balane sheet and Inom    tement, explainng its
nature and any cl o     considered useful.

will examine the manage_m  and organization of the bank, and its operating procedures, policies and
syems. Only for banks in Group E will significantly less weight be placed on the insional
diaosis, given that a preliminary institonal review has been conducted in these bans by an
EBRD team, whose resuts would be made available to the Consultants. In undrtking Fe
diagosmucs, the consultants are expected to visit the head office of the bank and mijor branches. Each

(xii)  Persomenn  a  MininW  Policy. The study .Vll determine whether the bank has
defined an adequate recumen and inermal   fg policy in order to match job
descptpdons and skill requirem, as weil as incenves to productivity gains, for
management, specialist and key clerica positions. It will also determine whether the
bank has assessod and prioritized sils shortas, and developed practical plans to
meet these shortfalls.
(I) Secoral Analyses Rdated to the Danos d Agroprom Dank and of Sber Bank
23.          The strategies   ed   for Agroprom Bank and Sber Bank as well as the related
action plans, will have to rely on a detailed assesment of: (i) agriculural credit and households'
financial services, respectively, over :he medium term, and (ii) the role that commercial bans are
expected to play in these areas, since both makets are now open to compeio.
24.          These  _e       are expected to: (i) present in detai banking services needed by
the different segments of the population and the agricultual sector; (i) analyze to what extent
common commercial banks can be expected to progmsively moet the population's and agricultural
units' demand on a commercial basis; (ill) defin and quanfy  of the population and
agricultural units, in particular in remote areas and/or with low income, that cannot be expcted to be
served by commercial ban in the next 5 to 10 years; and (iv) review options for providing financial
services in a cost effective manner to these groups. Particular attendin should be given to means of
reducing transction costs and of achieving high loan recovery rates, includig the development of
credit and savings cooperat, group lending schemes, efficent mobile banking servic  and the use
of the post-office network.
25.          Based on these    _       and on the analysis of dthe present suation and propects
of these two spialized banks, the consutan suld deemin: (i) if their prese  nwork and de
facto monopoly in many areas is a strong dett to the deveopment of compeion in bankable
markets and, if it is the case, propose adequate remedies; (i) oudtlin altrnative opdon and policy
guidRelies aimi  at promotng competidon and cost effective deiery of fncial sewices to all
segmen  of the populion and the agricultural sectors, respectvely; and (il) define the potetal role
for each of these two Iituions in both commercially bankable and non bankable markets in the
medium term, and the eal sad intel condton reqwired for thir fincial viabilit.

ACCOUNTING REFORM
1.           While Kakhst  is in the process of adoptng intatonal accounting standards in
conjunction with the mrision of the bankm' 'Chart of Accounts" and its recording prcedures, the
zxact structurl arrangements for pursuing this matter are still embryonic. Furtemore, the whole
process of stadard setdng and incorporating western (iterational) standards of accounting and
auditing also needs to be caefully evaluated in the context of Kazaklta's socio-economiL
development.
2.           The existng Chart of Accounts", datig back to the FSU  niform chart, is subject to
drastic revision and potental reduction of the main (synthetic) accounts. The rues applicable to the
charts were essenially in the form of procedur, and carefully thought through accounting stda
based on clear accounting concepts. With the expressed need to move to nLarket-oriented standards
(intermational standards) the whole accounting famework for private and public  terprises, and
financial institutions warrants drastic overhall.
3.           Auditing has wot been a distinct profession in the FSU, and only recently have
independen auditing firms been established. No auditig guidelines and procedures have been set
forth. Efforts are made to outine story reqirements for audits and audiors. In tis conection a
separte "Chamber of Auditors could be established, and would be responsible for auditing
standards, qualifica    d examnations for certied auis, as well as codes of conduct.
4.           The whole fvamework of stndard setting, development of layout of accounts,
reporting and disclows  re ements _want support by international bodies in order to develop
policies which are coherent and relvant to the new mergig economic realities.
S.           IDevdopnu. The institutional development would include the
folowg categories: (i) establishing an accounting taskforce, in charge of overseeng the overall
reform of accoundt  and uditng in         (i) develop an acuntng traing ifrasuue
(see Amex V-F); (ii) foster the establishmentteh     of the Acountng and Auditng
Associaton(s).
6.           Co& The TA Loan will finance the initial phase of acuntng and aditng reorm.
Costs include an estdma   USS 400,000 for 20 staffhont  at an estimated US$ 20,000 per staff
month. In addiion, an eotimated USS 125,000 equivalent in additional foreign currency costs are
needed to cover travel, subsisten, equipme  and otier        cost. Local costs are
estimted at US$ 75,000 equivaent, of which it is exped  that the IBRD wil finance US$ 50,000
equivalent and the GOK will fmance US$ 25,000 equivalent. Total costs are therefore  timad  at
US$ 600,000 equivalen.

SUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE
SPECIALIZED FINANCIAL SERVICES
TERM FINANCING AND FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP IN TE BANKNG SECTOR
PART I. TERM FINANCING
A. BACKGROUND
1.           The transition from a command economy to a mnrkedriented economy is inducin:
(i) a major shift in the absolute and relatve price stucture; (ii) a pronounced change in inter-
ente.,rse relations both betwee, entities inside Kuaksn ama between firms locaed in the Republkr
and those locaed in other CIS republics; and (iii) a completely new set of objectivs and incentives at
the enteprise level.
2.           As a consequence of this new envirnment some pr6duction faicilites wil not be able
to adjust and will hae to be closed, and many odtrs will need comprehensive restuct    to
become viable, while again others should be well positioned to seize new opporunities and to expand
rapidly in a profitable maer. Tle modification of the "rules f the gamen is also trast   in a
surge of new enterprises, mainly of small size, set up to exploit new market opporunities and to
compete with present or preo  satowned enties. All these fiundamental change will induce
important imvesment equiments and, for them to matera, adequate financg resoures.
3.           These strucu   al dificions in the epre sector are tking place in a
o c envhionm   that will not be conducive, for the next few years, to the domestc
mobiizion and I            of large amounts of medium and long term resouces. This cons
Inicas that te bulk of the new investme   will have to be self-finaced by existing enterpri,
thrugh incrased readned earing, and by th new entrepr   . In order to mitigate this
conaint Kazakhstmn intend also to rpidly prpae itself to be in a position to mobilize foreign long
term resources and to allocat them in the mrast efficien manmer.
4.           The atcipa   progressive nmprovnemet in the overal macro-economic situat  is,
however, exeed to graduially lift the above-menioned      ani d to lay the ground for the
provision of term finacing though the devdopment of capit  makes fediliies and the deepnng of
bankig fimons.
D. OBJECTIVE
5.           The two main objectiva of this study are to: (i) survey and priortize the diffent
sources of medium and long term fiancing that could be progrenively made aXvlable to enterprises
havig apopriate governance and manageria sructure as well as an adequate fincial sitation or
retrucrin program; and (ii) conduct a detailed feasibty    including the act  test of pilot
schemes, for the N        of exitng etities and/or the creation of the new stucu  that wil



-97-                                Anmex II-D
have been selected. The study will therefore focus on the needs of entrprises and will not include
housing fiance.
6.           The study will cover both securities - equities, bonds and hybrid instruments - that
can be provided either directly or through n _termeiates such as investme  funds, and risk-
Itemedad instruments such as credits and financial lea3es. For each of these financial tools the
study will aim, in its fis phase, at determining the minimal macro-economic conditions, the legal
framework, the refinancing sources and the strmctutes and/or institutions requ;xed for their emergence.
Based on this asessment, and on an analysis of the presen and foreseen economic and financial
situation in Kakbstan, the study will make concret and prioridzed re ndations for the
developmet of term finance.
7.           After discussions of these recommendations with the Kazakh authorities and the Bank
officials the study will proceed, in its second phase, with the detailed analyses that will be required
for the concrete imple ion of the agreed conclusions of the first phase. This will consist of:
(i) a rtudy ci the market, and of legal, financial, insdtudonal and implemetational aspects of the
retained project(s), and (ii) the actual processing, on a pilot basis, of four fiacial applications.
After havin identified adequat entrprises, and using the proposed sche=es, two comprehensive
offering prospet  for the syndication of a securities issuance and two medim to long term credit
applications will be prepared and presented to potental financiers in order to test their reactions and
to adjust, if reed, the proposed schemes.

G. BUDGET AND FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS
21.          It is esmated that phae one require some 7-9         of ex3tenal expers, and
phase two some 9-11 persomouths. The Consultant conct will also cover the cost of interpreters
and translators; travel, accommodation, and subistence; sundry supplies, concation, and
miellanus expenses; and a coningency of about 5 prce  of the contr  value. The total funding
of the contract shall not exceed US$ 500,000.
PART 11. FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IN THE BANKING SECTOR
22.          The monetary authorities are of the view that the banking sector is in a fngile
contion and that its strengthening - as a precondition for its playig a more active role in the
mobilization and intermediation of financial resources - wUll require an importan effort at
restructuring through provisioning and recaitalization.
23.          The complexity of this problem, as well as the hetergeny in the distribution of the
bad loans across sectors and individual  tutions, and the divety in the fiancial siaion of
idividual banks, will be aggravated by the stg    contran  faced by public finances. Its
resolution requires, therefore, a well designed overall strategic pbn, adaptable fiacial Intunts
ad detailed impl tion procedures.
24.          The dianostic studies to be financed under this Loan will give a detailed assessment
of the manitde and the diversity of this problem, and of the financial and opeational capabilities of
the different bank to patcipate in the mrolutio  of this problem
25.          Based on the above and the   going revenes by the National Bank, the study woild
aim,    s first phaw, at designg a    o ve acdt  plan aimed at ecai izing the banks and
at settng the conditions for avoiding the resugn  of new flows of ba loans. In this context, the
creation of a  e    on  1k that would finan  and swpen  resL *u-con
progrms for the state's largest loss-making entwprises if they are ecomically viable, and/or
enforce their liquidation if not viable, would be investigated.
26.          In its second phsOe, this study will: (i) recommend detailed an_e" ruired for
the implementation of the agreed strategy; (li) catry out a feasibility study of a Rehabilitation Bank or
other instiutons tat will be agreed upon by the athrites following discusso of the conclusions of
the first phase; and (il) test the proposed scheme on a pilot basis for two enterprises managed by the
same holding company. This will seve a the basis for the prparation of restuctuing plans under
dth component of the Techica Assistnce related to the supervision and resucning of major state

INSITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ON-SITE BANK SUPERVISON
A. BACKGROUND
1.           One aspect of the tansition process to a market economy in the Republic of
Kzkhstan is the devepment of capacity for prudential supervision over the banking system by the
National Bank of the Republic of Kaakhstn (NBRK) . Since the system of prudeal suersion in
the country is in its formave stages, it is necessarily beset by a munber of problems. These include:
indequat staffing (eleven full-time staff for a system that encompasse 185 banks and more than
5,000 branches ad agencies); salaries that are not competitive with those in the private sector; the
absence of powers to effcively deal with the larger speciaied bns; supervisory procedures that
were designed to ense compliance with economic regulations which are now outdated; and a
fnaial system that s heavily distorted by massive amounts of subsidies, reinc credit, and
lending to loss-ma     state enises.
2.           The technical aistance program oudined below seeks to overcome these obstacles by
comlemeing the asace provided by the IMP and USAID, whose involvement is in the
organiation  stucure of the baking supervision deartm   (BSD) and in other specific regulatory
aspects such as licensing, and off-site superision. The emphas   of the Project is to create a team of
bankig supervisors able to perm qualiy bank examinations. However, Govemment policy-makers
will need to make important and bold decisions regarding the appropriate role of subsidies, rfinance
credit, and the treame  to be accorded to losmaking enteprises for p ntl  supervision to be
tuly effective. Additionally, the NBRK should make efforts to provide adequate salary and career
development schmes for tose individuals partictinS in the strengthening program to prevent them
from leaving the institon in favor of the private commerial bakg sector.
3.           Bece of the small staff, there is a limit to the absorptive capacity of the BSD to
provide counps  and to undergo traning. Therefre, under the program, technical assitae
acdvities will proceed in a mamnr that coincides with the staffing of the deparment. Inital actions
will emphZe the taiig  of new emners on the Job. usitg the traing team concept, rather than
focusig on the devlcpment of procedur  and manuals. As individuals are trained, they will in tum
make better countepa for fher activities designed to formlize supevisory policies and
procedre.
4.           The NBRK i committed to significandy higher levds of staffing for the BSD and
enviges recimet of eligible n   employees from among rent university graduates. Not less
thn 80 po  ae neessay for profsional positios, of which nearly 3/4 should be involved in
on-site bank examination. NBRK m g      execx to have a team of least 30 staff in the on-site
supvi  divsion by October, which will include NBRK staff and 20 new hires. For thoe
recruited, iten  iuctio in  nages, prefrably English, wil comence at the onset.
Emphai on trai    young people is placed, since the god is to train people who wil assimdit a
new approach to bkng supervision. Also, care is takme to select the most appro   people out of



-103-                               Annex Il-E
the existing staff in the NBRK to conform the on-site examination team. The NBRK also envisages to
make efforts to keep the trained sWt. by working out an adequat salary and career development
scheme.
B. OBJECTIVES
5.            The main objective of this component is to initiate in the BSD of the NBRK an
effective program of on-site examination. Specifically, the goals are to assist the NBRK to:
*     create a strong, technically skilled BSD to enable it to assess effectively the conditions
of banks in the transforming environent of the Kazakh economy;
t'    train new BSD staff m basic bank examination skills, and developing overall enhanced
analytical capabilities in the BSD;
*     develop bank on-site examination guidelines and mamnals to promote the furdher
strengthening of the BSD;
*     provide policy advice to BSD and NBRK officials on issues related to baning
supervision and examination
3     upgrade the office quipment avaiable to BSD staff to facflitate on-site supevision.
6.           The work will be caried out in a manner contibutfing to the overall geral objectives
of s          the authority of the NBRK in the area of banking supervision in order to develop a
healthy and efficient fimancial sector.
C. ASSTANCE STRATEGY
7.           The envaged tecical assistne for onsite supevision will be saed in two
phases. The first phase will be fnaced with this Tecil Asiste Loan, and carried out under
these tems of refrce (except the puha  of eqipme). The second phase will be fimded in
1994-95 with the upcoming Finaial an Enteris Sectors Deve!pmnt Loan (FESDL). This on-
site supervision will supplement the assite of the ISP and USAD to off-site supervision and bank
licensing.
I_m L Under this Loan, technical assislance wil       with the provision of
two resident foeg advisors epienced in bank emion, for a period of up to two years. The
focus of their wotk wl be on tang, conducting paral on-site examination, and prepaion of
gideies and policies. Assice will start in Sp_temb, 1993, but not before the NBRK has
completed to hire dhe first bach of mruits. These terms of rnce refer to phase I.
Phae I. Further nsttional _a W   of the BSD will require assince for at
least two additional yeas. The World Bank has proposed to compleen  tis project by fincing
two additional adviso  startin about one year aftr st  of phase I. These advio  wLI stat
conducting full on-site examit    with the trained staff. One of them will be specialized in dealing
with problem loas. The   ond new advisor, specializd on risk      , will join the BSD
somewhat later.



-104-                              Annex II-E
8.           The resident foreign advisors in Phase I will have three specific tasks regarding on-
site examination: (i) formal trin    (ii) conducting e tions; (iii) providing policy aice and
guidelines.
9.           Given the lack of specialized staff, the program will focus on the development of a
capacity for on-site bank examination using a training teamt concept. Initially, the two resident
advisors will lead teams of examines into banks to be trained through a mix of classroom instruction
and practical on-the-job coaching. It is expected that each traing team will be comprised of six to
eight persons under the guidance of the bank supervision advisor. Each trainig cyclelpattial
examination is expected to last approximately two months. It is estimated that during one year the
advisors would perform at least ten to twelve patal examinations.
10.          During the first year, the NBRK will continue hiring new staff for the division of on-
site examination. New recruits should receive the formal training by the advisors, who will be
assisted by graduates of the previous training cycles.
11.          Out of the init al staff group of the on-site supervision division, the NBRK will select
twenty persons to act as liaisons with the companies conduting idh diagnostc studies of the ten
largest banks (Agroprom Bank, Sber Bank, Turan Bank, Kramds Bank, Creditoc Bank, Center Bank,
Igilik Bank, Alem Bank, Kazdor Bank, and lneivest Bank), which wil take place during August-
November 1993 under a differen component of the Technical Assistance Loan. This group will have
a unique opportunity to observe how on-site bank analysis is carried out with westen methodologies.
The experience they will % rive from this will add to the t   they receive through this
component.
12.          The advisors will conduct partil on-site examions, focusing on bak portfolio,
iquidity manageme, and intea controls, and wil prepae the corpnd  reports, whle tY
train the new recrits. These eaminations shoud be carried out in bans other than the 10 largest
bank. It is envisaged that ten pilot examinations wil be performed during the first year, and twelve
fiul eaminatons during the second.
13.          A thi responsibiliq of the foreigp advisors will be the participation in higher-level
discussions on the rests of the eabmions, and on the preparadon of policy guideli for their
impoved eudon. Staff will be trained to use common sene and educated inuion wben
exam g a banu  Therefore these giin  are not ntend   to be woperational manuals", but
rather to be used as reree guides by the trained staff.
14.            er qremt for sthe supevisty capabilities of the NBRK is the
acquisitn of compus and other equipm   for the on-site supervsion division of tie BSD. It is
expected that a maximum of one tenth of the total funds available through this componnt will be
spent on office automation. One of the two foreign residen advio  who will come to Kal atn
will have the responsibility to assess the computer r ements of the BSD. The advisor should lo
envisage the usage of a few portable computers for oe exmination.

TECHNCAL ASSSTANCE PROJECT
EMPLOYMET SERVICES
1.          An important featue of the current economic situation is the sharp increase in the
unemployed, from about 4000 in January 1992 to over 70,000 by the end of 1992. A high proportion
of currenly unemployed have been laid off by material production units and by service (especially
military complexes) units.
2.           Monitoring the unemployment situation is of utmost importance not only to prevent a
decline in the living standards of the populaton, but more importanly to mainin the morale of the
population during this difficult, but vcessary, transition period. The Miistry of Labor has only
limited experience in providing employment services on a mass scale. The staff of the Mhinistry are
not equipped technically and lack tie pracdcal experence to handle the deterioratng employment
situation in the short run. Technical assistance, therefore, is imperative to strengten the Ministry of
Labor's capacity to handle the challenge of transitional unwemployment.
3.           Project Objecties. The main objectives of the Project are: (i) to help design and
implement policies and programs in the mmediate short run in the area of unemployment relief;
(ii) to train staff in the development of labor market policies conducive to a maket economy and in
labor demand forecastng; (iii) and to belp modify the structre of employment services so as to
rnder them relevant to the changed economic, social and polidcal enviment.
4.           Projedt DesciptioL  The project will have four basic elements:
(i)   Providing to the Ministry of Labor the services of an intenational spcialist to
stregthen the capacity of the Ministry of labor;
(ii)   Setting up a small center for labor market stdies, atached to the Ministy of Labor
but not endowed with day-o-day adminirative responsibilities, to train the staff of
the State Employment Service. At this center, specilists from other countries will
visit for short durations of 7 to 10 weeb, but the cner wDI be largely managed by
local staff of the Minstry and the University.
(iii)  Inhe immediate short rn, training of a few core staff of the Ministry and the
Etployment Offices (5 to 8) for short period (10 to 12 weeks) abroad in Europe
(Wes Gemany or France) on problems rladtg to taing and retraiing of
disengged people in a market economy.
(iv)   Equipping th proposed center and the miistry with     .
S.  Sc&edl  The epatiate consultant is expected to begin his
usociation with the Ministy of Labor by October 1993, but the project implentaion will take
place over out year, i.e., November 1993 to November 1994. The Constant will discharge the
responsibii  outlied in the spefic TOR (encloed). It is envisioned that the Consultant will also

POVERTY MONITORING AND TARGETING OF INCOME SUPPORT PROGRAM
1.            hoissue of poverty and protection of vubable groups is a new one for the Kazakh
governme. The growth of a private sector may initially lead to a widening distribution of income,
and thus, to the possibility that some groups will wot be able to anition to the market economy with
the sme ea  as odtss. Wbereas income growth is a positive development In the long run, the
immediae concern is the growing number of poor and of vuleable groups in the county, and the
need to pot them frm falling firer into poverty. An est  part of this strategy is to ientify
the poor and to implement policies to protect this portion of the population by establishing a
comprehensive and realistic poverty line, as well as designing a monitoring system, including a
reliable family budget survey. This technical assistance project will stregthn the capacity of the
State Stastical Agency to monitor poverty, develop poverty line, and implement a quick survey of
living stndards. The following steps are proposed:
(i)    Asistne in seting up a Poverty Monitoring Cell, within the State Committee for
Stadstics or Ministry of Labor.
(ii)   Developmnwt of a definition of a minimum consumption basket for those completely
depndent on the State for their incomes. The establishment of a poverty line win
include loking at the consumption and production patts.
(iii)  Provision of technical and fi ial assistance to Goskomstat or Ministry of Labor for
the design and imple ton of a Monitoring Survey which would study the social
and economc needs of the poptaion, and measure the social impact of the economic
criis during the tanson period.
(iv)   Asistance in _onsucting a Consme Price Inde based on a basket of eential food
and nonfod items consmed by the poor, and use this index to deflate wage incomes
of the poor.
(v)   Anlye the nature of  nih   used by some of the vulnerable groups (particularly
peioner, unemployed, some emering rural private sector membes) to cope with
pvety and other social and economic strains. The study would collect quanttative
and qualteive data on these groups such as thei source of income and expenditue;
the level of communiy solidarity, and in particular, the existence of income ansfers
from househoDs.

EALTH CARE REFORM
1.                B      The terms of refaence set out below cover technical assistance (TA)
for specific aspec of bealth sector reform that were identfied as critical in earlier and more general
TA assignments supported by the Bank in FY92. The FY92 TA assignments assessed the overall
health sector - building on work performed by WHO, UNICEF, and UNDP - and focused on
system organzation, efficiency and finning.
2.           The FY92 finding can be summaized. Kazakhsta has an exceptionally large
number of hospital beds and medical persomel per capita and provides wide coverage with curative
services and selected child health services. In spite of the size of the infstrt , the mix and
quality of services have failed to produce significant improv tin Ifant and adult health,
esecialy over the last decade. The system is strongly biased toward cative services while
preventive services are poorly developed, physical facilities are of poor quality and suffer from
inufficient maitnance, medical training lags in up-to-date medical techiques, and the system
suffers from stucural deficiencies. The efficient use and supply of pharcicals is hampered by
non market pricing and distributional policies that do not reflec costs, and the upheaval in supplies
caused by the dissolution of the former USSR.
3.           With regard to health financing, budgeting and planning are hampered by the
inexperience of Ministry staff, the coniuing rapid inflation in the value of the ruble, and the need to
procure ph    cals and other key input at interational prices and foliowing international
prouement procedres for the first tme. Although a law was adopted to allow the Ministry to
assume the powers previously held by the Soviet government, no overall policy guides the
management of the sector. Staff has litle experince in managing, budgedng, and planning, since
pior to the dissolution of the Sovit Union, these    towere lwagely caried out in Moscow.
Finally, the Governt would like to develop the role of the private sector and has adopted a new
health fiancing law opening the way to possible private provision of cae and social insurce
financing. The ministry needs aisce to devise consistent and coherent policies In the area of
finae.
4.           Mm Mistry of Health (MOH) would like to adopt policies and a strategy to address
deficiencies in each of these areas but needs fresh viewpoints ad expetise from outside to inform the
process of policy develpme. As a first phase to meet the nee, toeical assistance is required
in the areas of: (i) healt sector finnce, (ii) pubLic heat policy, (iii) health sector organton,
(iv) budgeting procers, ad (v)  m   cals.

TE NICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
TRAINING COMPONENT
1.             azakhtan's ongoing transition from a command to a market economy is sevely
constrained by a scarcity of skills in some critical sectors and occupational categories. At the same
time, previously exsing taining systems largely lack the resources, and in most cases also dte
leadehip necessary to deveop and cary out suitable training for new skills required in a market
economy. As part of Bank-financed sector work in the human resources area, proposals are now
emerging for a new stategy for traing in Kazakdt   Te training componet of the proposed
Techncal Assistac Project descrbed in this anmex, together with other training investmen  directly
embedded in some of the techiical assistance components, can be seen as a first phase of
Implenon of this emerging strategy in three areas of highest ptiority, coniste  with the main
thrus and institution building objecives of the Project. A second phase of traing invesmen  in the
same and addidonal areas are anticipatd to form part of the proposed future Finanidal  d Entprise
sctor Project.
2.            The three areas of training selected for the project are as follows:
(i)    Financial sector training (inchlding training of bankers and bank aco_),
(ii)    Entrprise mangem  training, and
(iii)   Public sector magement traiing.
Thes three tri       Compon  are described in detail below. Their tot cost is estm_ad at
US$3.8 million, including US$2,975,000 in foreig eange costs and the equivalent of US$825,000
for local costs. Of tis, US$3,500,000 wil be finaced by th Bank, and US$300,000 wil be
finced by the Goverment of KL-=kstan. Together with  ddiona aing which is Iluded
under otaer          (for insn, on-the-job bank supevisor tng   wh    is imme    in the
technical asistance compnt for the financial sector), overall investent in tranig under this
project is maed at US$5.4 milion.

3.            ThIs 8taIng             would address two key profesiona  groups In the sector:
banker and bank          , ,prfesitonals typicy employed by commra bank. (Bank
spervi , who perform the prdentil suvisi  of the banig sM    on bedlf of gv
through their statuoy bodies for sh supevion, would be traned separae!y onahe-job under the
preset Project's techical        program for dte bankig sector.) The aining progrm  for
bakrs and bank accoants wil deal with parldy the same subject mate but wil be quite difere
from each othr in concept andi methodology, relei  t  diffec  in prfssonal viewpots and
espo-ibilities. They ae there  described separay in the following paragraphs.



-12S-                              Anmex m-E
1.     Taining of Banke
4.           Bacgrund. Changes aking place in the economic and financi markets of
Kazakhstan pr    the need for radicaly different methods of managing banis, marketing and
delivering bankin services, controlling risk, ensuring banks' fincial viability and performance, and
carying out basic bankig operations. Preparing banks to carry out thdir ne  role will require a
combination of institutional development, maisted by specWalized experts, and tining. Given the
iporne of skilled human eources to the development of the finacid sector a core training
progm  to meet primary skidlls needs shoud be established.
S.           Given the sation of Kazakhstans ban   system, the phasing of the institutional
devdopment and taining activities is likely to be somewhat uordox. In market economies,
taining of bankers is most often underken to instlU the tchnical or mnagemet sills necessy to
cay out previously defined activities for which a policy and procedural framework exist. As such,
trainn supports instittional efficiency and effectiveness. In Kazakbstan a more dynmic approach
to taining will be required since many of the changes in the banks' policies, procedures and
opeations wil not be implemented until isttutional development progams have been undertaken.
Such progam  will esblish the manner in which the funional areas of the banks, such as credit
and finance, wiU be managed, and the way customer service will be delhvered and transactions
processed. Institutional development programs, in essence, deine the new banking jobs for which
Staff and manage_m  will be tained, thereby establishing the objecti  and basic content of taning.
6.           Moreover, the regulatory and insdutional framework necessary to the banking system
of a market economy bave yet to be defied. To cite only one example, tiing in acconti
woud idealy relat to a country's accuting standatds and pinciples, but in Kazlstan, the
acconting standards are still in the process of e'boration. Accouting is particaly impt,
since it is the basis for finance, financil analysis, credit analysis, fina     management, and virtually
all discwls in the financia field. The same issues arise in the relaonshdip between crporate law
amd credit co cts. Stucturing a loan or credit coact taes place wit  a lega conte. In
Kruhtan corporate law is stll not wel articulated. Credit training thu needs to concern itsdf with
the evolving nature of conact.
7.           Ths the stuaton in Kazi   n  is uand clasical models of trainig for
a pre-establdhed framework do not apply. Yet te need to inidate some basic traning is urgent
becaue peonl in the baing system are amost totally unprerd to carry out the banking
acdvities which tiei new role requires. Relevas trning prgms can be devsed to cover core
needs in basic banig dbsiplines so that bank staff and enant to the field can operat more
effecvely. Trainn withn the contex of a framework unduoing raical   sfton will liely
be an Interctve proom. To accomlish it fctly Wil require sidll and flexibility.
Concyltaoly, a pogram of ore kils could be introduced. Posseion of these skills would pemt
bankers to paricpate effectively with foreg tech     e s in the elaborato of inional
develoent as well as in the evolving finnca makes. Subsequent to defining a bsic approach to
maagi  the major banking funio, more daborted and detail spefx trainig prgu woud
tak place.

gDvermaats and institutions in the developmentof the banking sytem in Esem   Europe and the



-126-                             Annex m-E
FSU has provoked a stream of stdies, consultants, visidng missions, visiting lecus, trainig
invitations to foreign banks and training proposals. The offers and proposap are from countries with
banking systems and practices, which though converging, still differ In many   pes. Thus, bankers
in these regions are being exposed to a variety of banking methods and tecbniques.
9.           Currenty, training provided consists largely of courses of short duration which is
more akin to exposur than to aining. Though the exposure gained by bankers in these regions is
undoubtedly beneficial in building awaeness of bankig techniques, it can not provide the skills
building needed to actafly cary out modemn commercial banking activities. Increasingly, training
will need to have a greater degroe of consistency and depth. This proposed sub-componen aims to
build a sound and consistent foundation fo bak   training to be fiuther developed in future
projects. While the program should address the most pressing needs first, a process should be put in
place to ensure that evolving needs are met.
10.          Obje:tves of the              T. he objectives of this program are as
follows:
(i)    To establish a core curiculum f  training of bankers which addresses priority
banking skills and tanig needs;
(*)    To adapt and develop a set of traning materias for effectively impartng the core
curriculum;
(iii)   To aisist the NBRK in malig tempory fcilities and equipm    available to permit
rapid start-up of t   activies;
(iv)   To initte a training program for key banking officials using the core curriculum and
training matials;
(v)    To train national training       adsm  a ind  erv; and
(vi)   To prepare a dealed plan for the estblime  of a permanent b n training
institute, and implement tis plan to the exOent possible in the tefame allowed.
11.          S&rq. The strategy to achieve the above objectives would be to invte a well
established bang tranng institutio with inmaional  periec to provide aiae  in the
selection and prpaat  of cmdculum and materas and to supply         eexpvertis and
expeenced bainkg ars to prepae and ihiate tng in key area (inlmudig selectig outside
training providr when availe), tain naional traine, and topl  and assist NBRK   erning
the permane  traihg in_  to be astablibsed. The mtig institution's staff would work closely
with NBRK staff on all aspects of the work
12.          Pdmy SIM Neeo   Traing neded for the develapment of banking profssionals
to meet the needs of I[azft Ws bag    system has not been pecisely defined. However, based
on preliminary Imp ons and discussioms with the bans and the Centrad Ban, it is clear that
tecica and            skils need to be dveloped in the areas of credi analysis and risk
_anagant, asset and liability mangemt, planing, muaket  _u     and generl management.



-127-                              Annex m-E
It will take time to precisely define skills requiments in these areas for the reasons outlined earlier.
However, courses can be initiated covering the basic priciples of these disciplines.
13.          Since credit is at the core of banking and the area of highest risk, it is proposed to
proceed in priority with the elaboration of a credit training program. At this stage of development,
the banks also need to develop skdlls in planning in order to reorient the way in which the banks are
managed. Threfore, it is also proposed that train  in the methods of stategic, tactical and
finacial planning be given priority. This discipline forms a basis for managing by objectives rather
than by procedre or task which is cental to the reorientation of the rnanagement approach in the
banklng systems of Kazakhstan. Courses will also be required in topics such as: money and bankng,
capital markets, international banking, trade finance, genal magement, markeng and retail
bang.
14.          Eleme_s of a Training PIogram  The foUlowing paragraphs s _umarize the main
components of a trainig progr for professional bankers: bank mangers and techical specialists in
the financial field. Trainig of clerical staff, branch tellers and information system specialists is not
included in this proposal, though such  ning is also of high  porace. A training program for
professional bankers would be composed of the following compones:
15.          Coro Curichl   The core culum   would consist of financial accountg, credit
and lending. These are the central topics in Western ban' professional trng programs. Courses
in planning, budgetng and performae m   at and in other topics of financial management
such as asset and liability management and foign exchan   risk    e   are also needed at this
time in order to reorient the way in which banks are managed and to respond to the needs of financial
market development. Generl courses on topics such as: an imroduction to money, banklng and the
role of bantks in a market economy, fincial markets, markedng, human resource management, and
trade finace would also be provided.
16.          A course should be develwoped that would provide an introduction to banking in a
market envrnment. It would descibe the    _e    and opational needs of banking in a
fina l ma . The themes covered w d provwide an intoduction to credit risk magement,
fiaci  managemen, marketing, plaing, tading and inteal controls. Individual courses in the
core curriculum would cover these topics in more depth.
17.          TnIng Matwerl.. Trining         I are readily availble in English and other
Western European languages. Such materals have become a prod   an d are sold by numerous
vendors. It will be necesay to chs from readily avaible marials those which are relevant and
to develop others s necessary. Moreover, for taing  to petat the baniing insutis of
Kazkstan, an defort must be undetakn to trlte sdected mateis into Russian. It is also
necear to develop case studies bae on the banking envirom     of the country. Several types of
aining merials could be used: txtboolm, reading, case studies, sef corrting workbooks,
audiovisua pesentatio  and computer misted learing. Once the core program is defined necessary
trainig maerials would be gatered and/or developed.

foreign experts, a number of countries have established tran    instiutes. This approach has boen
successfuly followed in Hungary and Poland, iwer alia.)
19.          Inputs. To carry out he strategy described above, the following inputs would be
necessary:
(i)    The services of an experienced bankig traming   institution to provide advisory
services and the services of administrators and trainers;
(ii)   substantial staff iputs from NBRK; and
(iii)   servces of local Project Implementation Unit in suppordng the above activities in
Kar;bstan, and specifically, to acilitate the creation of links between NBRK and
local training isitutions.
20.          Ilam. The aim would be to implement ius subcomponent at the eariest
possible 'te, which woud require invidng prposals from qlfied banking training insdtutions
immedately following Board approval, sartng consultant field work in the early summer of 1993,
and complete the sub imponent withn a year. Implem on would again be comaatively
straihtfoward, to be maged by the conacted Insdtution under the spvision of the PIU.
21.          Cost Fatiae lTe total cost for implenting the strategy as described would be
in the range of $1,075,000, including $850,000 in foreign currency and the equivalent of US$225,000
for local costs of which the Bank will finance US$150 million.

FutErmore, the whole process of standard settig and incorporatin westem () stdads
of accounting and auditng also needs to be careflly evaluated in the contex of l khstan's

25.          The whole framework of standard setting, development of layout of accounts,
reporting and disclosure requrem   warrants support by international bodies in order to develop
policies which are coherent and relevant to the new emerging economic realities.
26.          Training Needs. Vast efforts are warranted to train, retrain and upgrade bank
accountan  (and auditors) in Kazkhstan. Their previous triinwg was essentially along lines of
bookkeeping. A modenized banking system will require a great nmnber of accountants with different
quaifications (such as financial accounting, management/cost accounting, auditing, information
systems) to cater to the new needs of a market-oriented economy.
27.          Objectves. The objectives of this sub-C -ponent would be to:
(i)    support the reform of bank accouning and auditing in Kazakhstan by providing
assistance to a task force to develop new guidelines for accountig and auditing
methods and procedures;
(ii)   developing curricula and training materials for the purpose of training bank
ccountants and auditors in new methods and procedures, includg in-house training
programs and extneal courses;
(iii)   assist in the development of an iftucture for accountg training, including in-
house taining systems in major bans as well as relevant programs at universities
and other instdions; and
(iv)   initiate and implement training programs for accountan and auditors as well as staff
of train  institutions and dep   thogh in-country courses and study tours to
selected Western counties.

system for which entaepis  and their managers are not prepared. Both those enterprises that have
already incororated and toe liklly to remain in the public sector in the short or medium term are
facing the new realiy virtally without any experience of fiee markets and, in many cases, without
the necessay           of basic economics and management principles. As a result, in addition
to the inevitable hardshps imosed by the loss of markets and the scarcity of pars and raw mateials,
large hnffciencies and losses result simply from iadequate decision-making due to a lack of insight
in basic matters such as costig and pricing of products, efficiency and productivity monitoring,
marketing, and worker modvation and persomel management (as weBl as from traditons of disregard
for product quality and fs  and of non-delegation of decision-ming per se).
34.           Under those  rcun managen  traing is a clear priority and expendi_tu
in this area should have high returns. However, it should be remembered that the same lack of
informon and suitable atuxdes that leads to poor management decisions in general also ma
managers reluctant to train themelves and their staff. For this reason, part of this proposed first
phase of management trining is devoted to actes that are means to overcome inial redeence as
mwuh as to deal directly with the problems. It is critical in this context that the inidal traing should
be targeted on top level mas   in compnies which show clear signs of being receptive to trainig;
otherwise traing at lower levels will not be possible or will be ineffective.
35.          In designing the program, it is also Important to keep in mind the main problem at
this stage, which is that managers are making basic but critical mistaes in area which deermine the
health and survival of thdr companies. What is missing is not the rfinement of highly sophisticated



-131-                              Annex M-E
Triig should diedy addrs these issues in their context. The worst that could happen at this
stage would be a dispersal of effort in all directions, catering to the vagaries of the latest managemem
fashions from the West.
36.          Objectves. The objectives of this sub-componen would be:
(i)    To initiate a cycle of enterprise mnagement tining activities to be subsequeny
followed up by other Bank projects. During this project, the following objectives
would be achieved:
(a)   25 qualified management trainers would be trined;
(b) 20 key managers of selected enterprises would be trained in a programs of
nteships;
(c)   Training materials focusing on the problems of Kaakh enteprises would be
repared according to a detailed plan prepred by consults;
(d)   30 local management constat would be traed; and
(e)   Action learing groups for Kazakh mangers would be iitatd
throgh one core group coordinated by a consultant.
(ii)    To engage local traing institutions in these proesses, with the aim of subsequendy
selecting the most appropriate to participate in later stages of the project.
37.          State. While solid commiment on the part of the Kak govrnme  would be
critical for the long run sucoess of this sub-component, the stategy for this fit phase of assistance to
enteprise management training is to start rapidly based on the experience and abilit of foreig
ancies, and to use this iial period to establhsh close l;nin with the Kazak goveunnnt as well as
with local training institutions, both public and pvate. To achieve the above objetv, a six-
pronged strategy would be applhed as follows:
38.                                tran of  s. An intrin  nsttuton spalizing in the
selection, placement and follow up of forgn stude  would be comptively chosen to condct a
program of recrulitn3  of taented Kzakhs to sudy abroad for a period of one year. The prom
should be nationlly a     anG open to high level candaes who wib to become tas of
management nd ecoomics. Prefe    wfll be given to candidates fluent in Eglish, with degre
and experience in  _        and eeince in tehing. Te selection would be done by th
conracting instdon, with the pardcipation of Kazaks.   e chsen candib    wold be se  to
appropria   titutions abroad and offered a progrm focuing on the core issues of    _   and
the economic backgrud necesy to dea with tm.
39.          An           pronp am for Kazakh maager. An hiteatio   oanio
would be chosen to undeak a program of ntusbips for Kazah managers. The same consultan
grwp that would select enterises (see et pargph) woud  also ce  the patcipt
entepries and the mangers that would go abroad for periods frm two to six mout. Selected



-132-                              Annex M-E
managers should have at least rudiments of English, German or French (and can be given time to
improve their language between selecton and travel dates), be in cnrcal positions inside their
enterprises and have leadership inside their organizations. The contracting organization would
identify suitable enerprises in the same sectors as those in which the respective managers work, and
organize the program of internships with those enterprises. Prior to departure, participants would be
thoroughly prepared for the visit, a _tnding lectue on economics and related subjects. The
enterprises should be willing to pay a small share of the costs of the program, as a demonstration of
their commitment to it.
40.          Preparation of       a    _ trng materab. International consultants on
management problems would be hired and brought to Kazakhstan to examine and docunent the
situation of twenty selected fim  from a management point of view. The Bank, in conjunction with
the Ministry of the Economy, would develop the criteria for inclusion of firms in the program would
and agree on their selection. In general, the program would aim at firms which are strategically
important to the Kazakh economy and are willing to engage in such an exercise. The consultants
would then work at the enterprises and discuss with their managers their evaluation of the situation as
well as possible plans of action. A modest amount of follow up in the implemention of these
actions should be included. While this consulting exercise should be direcly useful to the form, from
the perspective of the present project the main target would be the preion of training materials
for future consultants and trains (in addition to provide the on-the-job-opportunities mentioned in the
following section).
41.          On-the-job trining of m          consulat. A major subproduct of the
activities of the international consultants should be the apprenticeship of local consultants. Prior to
the beginning of the consultations, one of the foreign condltants would select local candidates to
become "arentices" during their work in the local firms. All the activities of the foreign
consultants should take place witfi the collaboratio of the local trainees. Each foreign consultant
should work with three local trainees who would also serve as interpreters ad raearch assistants.
These trainees should have a major role in the preparation of the training materials.
42.          AcIon LearI g. An internation  consultant with experience in coordinating groups
of Action Leaning (R. Revans method) would be contracted to create one such group in Kazakhstn.
His/Her tasks would include the discsion of the participatin eterpris  with the Bank and the
Ministry of the Economy, contacts with these enterprises for the selection of the participants, the
creaion of the group and the organzation of periodic meetings to discss isues and progress. The
consultant should expect to stay for one month in Aliaty to lauch the program and to return
periodically for the meetngs of the group (once a month). These meeting should be funded for a
minimum of two year. Paricipan  not liig in Almty should be given finnciad support for travel
and boarding.
43.          Creatng lin wih losa trig   _tm. While time constraints force this
initdal part of the program to be very heavily dependent on intaonal coultants, this period
should also be devoted.to creating local roots that can support subsequent phas  and initiatves of
management training. All the above activies should take place in ineraction with local institutions
and should sub-coa  suitable tass with tln. The experia  of working with a variety of local
institutions will permit a progressive enagemen with those that respond beter and prove to be better
patners in this process.

44.          Inputs ReqWred. To canry out th strategy described above, the following inputs
would be required (items numbeng refer to objectives above):
(i)    (a)   Services of an inrnad   training institution to manage the training of
trainer program in Kazakhstan and host countries;
(b)   Services of an international organizaton to arrange and implement the
internship program for maners;
(c), (d) Services of an nemational management consulting group to analyze Kazakh
firms, prepare training mateials, and train local consultants on-the-job;
(e)   Services of intenational consultant to organize action leaning group
(preferbly under same contact as for (c) and (d);
(ii)    Services of local Project Iplemenaion Unit in suppordng the above activities in
Kaakdsta, and specifically, to facilitate the creation of links between NBRK and
local training institutions.
45.          Detailed Terms of Reference for the above consultants' services would be prepared
and agreed at loan negotiations. Consultants would be selected in accordance with the Bank
guidelines, taking into account eventual efficiency gains by using the same consultants for vanous
tasks depending on capabilities and experience.
46.          Impl on. The aim would be to implement this sub-component at the earliest
possible date, which would require inviting proposal from qualified consultants immediately
following Board approval, stardng consultant field work in the late summer of 1993, and complete the
sub-compment within 18 months (with the exception for the action grTp learning program, which
will take up to two years overall). Implem tion would be compatvely straightforward, to be
managed by the cosultants under the supervision of the PIU.
47.          As mentioned above, efficiencies may be achived by aggregating functons and
contracts using the same consultants, depending on the particularities of proposals received.
48.          Cost. The overall cost estimate for this sub-component is US$1,075,000, including
US$850,000 in forign exange cost and the equivalent of US$225,000 for local costs of which the
Bank will finance US$150 milliom.
C. Publc Sector           I Tranig
49.          mBound. As Kazkstan moves from a command economy to a market
economy, the role of government will change fuanlly. As a consequence, the attitudes,
knowledge and skills of civil servants will also need to change radically. As the new finctions and
processes of the govemment emerge, it is hiportat for it to develop methods of identifing these
new requiments, and to deveop a strateg and a permanent but flexible program to help train and
retrain civil servants to meet them. To achieve maximm impact, traiing should start at the earliest

possible moment and at high levels of authority in the service, as well as include the training of
trainers. It should be developed gradually to accompany and support civil service reform, and should
be carried out in such a fashion that it both addresses imediate problens and builds ownership and
motivation among trainees; this can best be achieved through an endogenous training process in which
participan  play an acdve role and contribute to curriculum objectives and content. Such an approach
will also make it easier to obtain the intended multiplier effects when training graduates are called
upon to apply and transmit their new skills throughout the reforming civil service.
50.          Purpose. The purpose of this sub-component are to: (i) help the Governent of
Kazanstan redae the role of the civil serice and support its restruuing for its key functions in a
mat conomy (in synergy with oter technical assistance provided under the Project); (ii) identify
the attitudes, kmowledge and skills that need to be acquired by civil servants to meet new job
requirements; (iii) develop a strategy and programs for the neceary taining, (iv) initiate training of
selected civ sran, icluding trains, tough seminars, study tours, and foflow-up training
programs to be carried out by graduates of the programs; and (v) develop capacity in selected training
institutions in Kakhstan to provide necessary fure taining for the public service.
51.          Objeclv. In quantitative terms, the objectives of this component are as follows:
(i)    to tain 300 per   (240 civil servants and 60 tainers) in three separate semina  in
Ka;
Di)   to tin 100 persons (80 civil servants and 20 trainers selected from the 300 seminar
rIpat) hrough study tour abroad; and
(iii)  to carry out a minimum of 300 training progrms in Kazakhstan for civil servan
(tiese programs wil be delivered by seminr partcit).
52.          Taining needs i      n, strueg and program formulation, and development of
capacity in traing        would be caried out as part of the seminars (repr ves of
taning intitton would be included among selected civil servan  and trairs). The above
objectives woul4 be achioved in about 18 month  ating uaound mid-')3.
53.          Shrtegy. The strategy for this component would be very process oriented. The core
of tie progran would be a serie of three diaosc seinars each with about 100 paricpants,
ornizd with the belp of womutan and held at regular four to six monts intervals in Alnaty.
Betwee the seminr, study tours would be arrnged for selected seminar partcipants with the
assistance of dte _s   , and participants would also prepae and carry out local tainig
programs.
54.          Inputs. Ibe Aputs necesary to carry out the above stra     would consist of:
(i)    The services of ietional consultats specialized in the training of hig level
public service personnel and in the application of pacipatve taning methods, and
capable of oranizi  suitable sud tours for senior civil servants and traiers in
selected conies eperiend in civil service rdornm; and
(ii)    Fidna   for study tours, seminars etc., including costs of trvel and    o dation
for tnees, Intp s etc.

55.          Imp"o. The overall implemention and supervision of the ub-componen,
and responsibility for liaison with the PU and other donors, should be tasks for a Steering Group
which should indude rerentatives of:
(i)    The Ministry of Economy;
(ii)    Heads of key training istitutions in Kazabtan; and
(ii)   The consultants contracted to assist the sub-component.
56.          At each of the semina, a team of consultants and trainers conracted for the purpose
under the project would first meet for dgnostic and planning puposes with the Steering Group for
public service trn  togeter with staff from those institutions identified to provide training for the
civil service in Kaastan, to plan tining acvities. (The PIU would be informed and invited to
atend all meetinp). This would be followed by the one week workshops for a total of 100 civil
servants and tainers as described in detail below. Finally anoter meedtn with the Steering Group
would be devoted to evaluating outcomes, plan for activities until the next seminar, and select
participant for study tours.
57.          The broad purpoes of each seminar would be:
(i)    to review the activities underken within the project framework since the last seminar
(note: this would not be the case for the fit seminar - the equivalent acdvit would
be to share bas information and clarf respective toles and contritions to be
made to the project);
(ii)   to prove an oppornmity for tainers and civil serva  in Kazhst  to lean about
modern approaches to civil service magement and the relaed aining;

and
(iv)   to pla a progm  of actvites, including working groups ad otder activities in
Kazakbstan and study visit to other count, that would tabe place in the period
before the next semia.
58.          The following program is proposed for the first semia:
(i)    A two day meeting of the Steering Group;
This meedng would  marize the consultns with the stuaon in Kalsta  make
final plan for the workhops (see below) and clarify the anme   for the
management of the overal project.
(i)    Three one week workshops in Almatr for a tota of about one hundd civil servas
drawn from centrd mhi e and regiona   InIstaIons together with seior staff
from the selected traing imstittons in Ka1 tan



-136-                               Annex M-E
The workshops should include:

Kazaki3stan and by members of study tours.
(iii)   A further meeting of the Steering Group to agree the progrm of acdvities before the
next seminar and select participas for the working groups and study tours. The
program of activities would include the following:
(a)   St   tours to other countries where the expeence of civil service reform and
training is direcdy relevant to the needs of Kazkistan;

(eg orgnizing training programs to dbseminate lessons leuaned at the
workshops); and
(c)   language s          programs for those with basic English. French, etc.
59.           The subsequnt semnars would follow a similar patt, placing a greater emphash
on evaluating progress achieved within the changing envirome. Each semia would be used to
make adjustments to the project to meet any shortm_ing in the work already undeaken and to
reflect the developig u         of needs in Kazakhstan.
60.           The cdtera for  aluating th success of this sub-compone  would be (i) the impac
the training progrm is maig on the quality of managemeDt in the civil service, and (ii) the
additional capaciy created for delivering qualit training program  in Kazakbstan. Quantative
performnce indicatos for criterion (i) would be identified as part of the consultat's tem  of
rnce  and would be submitted to the Stering Group for Wroval and monitoring. For criterion
(ii), meaes of increased staff capability in trainig ismtitutions, faciLties available for taining and
nuers of coures offered would all be appropriate indicators.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
TERlMS OF REFERENCE
I. LEWAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMONENT
1.           The Goverrmt of Kaakstan (the Government) has applied for a loan from the
Bank to finance, inter alla, legal technical assistance activities in support of the Gove ent's
economic reform progrm. The services descnbed in these Terms of REence (TOR) are to be
fianced under the legal assistance component of thiS Loan.
2.           Project Objevese. One of the objecdves of the Project is to asist the Government
in the development and implemtaon of a legal and institutional framework to ptomote private
sector activities and assist in the transition to a market economy. The emphasis of these TOR is on
provision of a program of legal assistance to support such fmework. Flexibility and adaptability in
the implemaion of the TOR will be critical for the success of the Project.
3.           Project Sope. The areas of law to be covered by the Project are potenially very
broad, including businesscommercial law (the terms 'business"and 'commercial" are used
nterchangeably in these TOR) and legislation in thf fields set out below, as they rela  to (or have an
effect on) business activity. The lisng below is; ended as an indication of the type of are  in
which the Consultans (the terms "Consultants" L4 "legal assitce team" are used iangaly
in these TOR) will provide legal epertise ( _   and diaosis, drftn, review of drft,
-Implemion monitorng and enforcemnt assistane, tning, and instutional developmt). The
liStinDg does not imply that existng or daft legislatio is  adequate or should be changed, nor that
specific laws should be enacted for each of these topics, some of wbich overlap with others or reflect
concepts borrowed from different legal systems. Prelminaty legal asstan  in some of these areas
may be prvided by other sources. In such cases, the Con ltas may be asked to review legislation
drafted by oters in order to check its consisency with the oveal lea faework and reom
progrm.
4.           The following is an indicae listing of potentl topics: company law; banrutcy
law; conact law; property law; real eate law (including titing, regiaion, etc.); protection of
intellectual propty; sureties law (seured transacions, including mortgage, lien, etc.); leasing;
securities law; law of negotable isument (cbecks, notes, etc.); banking law; private acconting

5.           Not aUl of the areas of law mentioned above are equally important although they could
at some point be critical for the development of the private enterprise sector. In determinng priorities
in the scope of assistance and implementation the Consultants should involve the private sector in
order to learn where the perceived major problems are. Some other areas - like legislation on
banking, procurement of goods, and services, payment system, financial institutions, interbank
clearing of settlement mehanisms, and the development of legal information system and training
support mechanism for the Ministry of Justice - will be subject of separate terms of reference and
the task of the Consultants will be to coordinate and ensure consistency of these other tasks with the
overal legal reform effort.
6.           The assistance will focus not only on draft legislation and regulations, but, also on
their proper implementation and enforcement. This will, inter alia, require the development of
informaion and documentation sources on legal reform in the business law area, the trainin of staff
of concerned agencies, and assistance in developing the needed administrative and institutional
mechanisms and procedures for the application of the new legal frmework. In addition mchnisms
to enforce laws and regulations wil be addrsed and reforms proposed as appropnate: for example,
in the area of bankruptcy a full range of assistance should be provided to help the authorities in
establishing procedures for the timely and efficient liquidation of bankirupt enterprises.
7.           The Consultants' specific work progm  wil be further deied in an Inception Report
to be drafted by the Consultants and approved by the Government. The conten of the Inception
Report wil reflect the priorides at the time and wiU reflect assistance received or promised from
other sources (for example, lawyers financed by other donors or by the Govemment). In general, the
Consultants will:
(i)    Assist in drfting key economic, financial and business leglion according to the
priorities established. The laws or a s  thereof will be prepared with the
utmost concern for coherence, practicability, and approprte integration with
Kaakstn legal, insituonal and cutural traditions. If the drafng of laws has
already been done the Constants' activities wil focus prmaiy on comments on
pich drafts.
(ii)   Advise on institutions, including agencis, regulatory bodies, and dspute settlement
mecbaims needed to implement the new laws and regulations; ad assist in
prearing appriate institutional development or strungthening prorms and
implemnIng decrees and regulations.
(iii)   Monior implementation and enforcement of the reevant texs to identify problems or
bottlenecks in thdir excution.
(hv)   Assist in designing remedies to corect imple ion or enforcemnt problems.
8.           TraI1_. The project is an institution-building exercise and a basic training program
for lawyes should be designed. The training will focus in partia on the neds of lawyers worig
for key economic mstries and agenies, judges, law fauldties and stdet. Trin will include:
(i) on the job activities; (i) focussed seminars and coures; (il) paricipation of selected lwyes in
semiars held abroad; (iv) partiipation of selected candiae in fellowships at foren  law schools;
and (iv) iersips at the Consultnts', or odter approprate offices.

D1. BANKING LEGISLATION COMPONENT
A. BACKGROUND
27.          The transition from a command economy to a market economy requires considerable
changes in the legal frmeork. A number of Important legal refotms have already been initiated with
the view to provide an adequate framework for ensuring sustained banking soundness and stahility
over the long term. The efficient enforcement of these laws will also require that adequate resources
are devoted to developing proper institutional support and implementation procedur  and to training
skldled professionals.
28.          The authorities are actively pursuing this process. A new National Bank Law, a new
Banking Law and a new Law on Foreign Excnge have been recenly approved by the Parliament.
These laws are the stting point for the building of a new legislaive framework for banlkng
activities.
29.          The technical assistance program on baking legislation described in the following
aragraphs will focus on commercl banking activities and therefore complement the assistance
provided by the lnational Monetary Fund that conentats on issues rdated to National Bank
actvities and intrnational relations, in particular foreign exchange tansaca .

iterbank transactions that are to be upgrded under the Payment System component of this project;
(iii) pdate te legsbon goveig financial istume; and (iv) strnte the skldls of NBRK's
commercial bns' and tribu ' staff slized in banking leislation.
C. ASSISrANCZ  SITEGY
31.          The envisaged itecal astce program will be carried out by a law firm ( here
after reerrd to as It'e conulat) having high credentials and long experience in baking issues, as
well as a good k)wlwdg of the legal and bankg frmwork in CIS coutries and o    transition
economies. The project can also fince local experts who have Idependent prcices or are members
of local law firms.
32.          I is epected that the selected firm will provide a residet expert as team leader, an
adequate back-p from headquaters, short-term expets when required, and training materid. The
tainig   cmponen will represent about on-uart of this program.

TECCAL ASSIANCE PROJECT
I[NSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT - ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.           Kazakhstan's industrial base is many concentrated on heavy industry and natural
resource exraction, both of which have produced a legacy of environmental degradation and health
risk. Regardless of the course of industrial restucturing and privatzation, fitmre production is likely
to continue this trend without strengthened and expanded capacity for environmental monitoring and
management.
2.           Strengted environmental and resource management, particularly water and land
resources, is equally important in the agriculture sector wbich contributes an even larger share of
GDP primarily through crop and livestock production on 35 million ha of crop land and 185 million
ha of range land (of which only 55 million ha are thought to be in good condition). The development
of vast collective and state farms on marginal land with central government budget support has
resulted in critical agro-ecological problems including deteriorating range land, depleted and degraded
water resources, and pollution from excesive use of agro-chemicals.
3.           Current pollution problems and degradation of naural resources stem mainly from
past economic policies of the fonner Soviet Union that promoted quanitative targets set for the whole
country and its diferent secto by the ceal plnning authorities. These policies were accompanied
by pricing policies under which natural resources were undalued and the environment as a whole
was treated as a free good, both by productive sectors and by consumers. In parald, the lack of
enviommenal policies, sound enviro   l r ations, realistic envir    standards, and an
environmental managemt syem incapable of enforcing those reions and stadards has led over
the years to over-usage of naftual resc  and their degrdation, as well as to pollution levels with
increasingly adverse effects for public health of the popuatn.
4.           While the macr-economic and policy  rms supported under this project are likely
to result in signic    v       benefs, partiualy as inefficient and pollution inensive
production facilies are closed or replaced by cleaner techology, and prce reforms lead to more
rational and efficin land, water, and agicultu  input use in the agdculture and livestock sectors.
Experience bas showwnlat apprpiate policies and icenves are necessary but not sufficient for cost-
efficient eron    l control and imprwvement. An efftive institutional arrangement wheby a
realistc and mporiented regulatory system can be dveloped and implemented is also
essential.
5.           Comn 0NObjetves. This componen of the project wl identify ad adrs key
shortcomings in the current environmen ta      system of the Mbistry of Ecology and
Bioresources (MAEBR) and reld organizations and  situtes including the Ministries of Indury,
Health, Agriculture. The aim would be to stegten the cpacity of MEBR to monitor and gather
infonmation on erme    resouces ad problems, adequately estabUsh priorities, develop a



-149-                              Annex IV-B
prelimnary environmal strategy, and identify options for institutional and policy change, and to
make full use of the existing legal and policy framework. The component would support the
preparation of interim guidelines and regulations, institutional and organizational assessment, training
and hands-on experience through pilot and demonsttion acSivities. Component activities will be
developed in support of three objectives:
(a)    Assessment an upgading of the institutional capacity of MEBR and related
organiztions for environmental  nagement;
(b)   Development of interim guidelines and regulations for high priority sectors
related to privatization and restructuring in industry and agriculture,
particularly in the areas of enviromnental review, environmental audit and
enviionmental liability;
(c)    Assessment of information resources and monitoring systems, and enhancing
the capacity for prioty setng.
6.           Component Desription. The envisaged technical aissance program would address
immediate environmental needs relat  to the ongoing prom of privatization, and carry out
activities in the area of institutional steng   and priority setting that are citical for stablishing
a long-term program of improvement and reform. Thee task corresponding to the three objectives
outined above are envsaged:
Task i. -  I rndwdenal S&xgtuxg. This task will establish priorities for capacity
building, taining, and institutional refomi, develop a corresponding work program within the
ministy, and assist the MEBR and other orgniztns to cary out the work plan including limited
high priority traiing for staff. Acivites would include:
(a)    A _t of presen nsitutional arrangements for environmeWal
mnanagauent and oientficatn of progm  and priorities for reform
including policy planning, priority settng, standards, enforcement and
peiting, and envromnent   review;
(b)   A      _  of staff training neds for priority programs, and
implemetation of training activitis;
(c)    Pwvide ass e to the MEBR to develop the capacity to canry out
ical project imsplementation funions including procuremnt,
coordion, and project finial mangem;
Task2. - &Zh_waual Reviw ad Aul*l. As the process of policy reform,
