MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION
OF THXE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTI   DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN
TO THE REPUBIC OF KAZAN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and re mdation on a
proposed Technical Assistance Loan (the Loan) to the Govemment of the Republic of Kazaklstan for
the equivalent of US$38 million to support the Government's overall reform program. The Loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a matrity of 17 years, including 5 years
of grace.
2.           The Republic of Kazakhstan joined the IMF on July 15, 1992 and the World Bank on
July 23, 1992. An economic mission visited Kazakhstan in April 1992 and a draft Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) was distributed in November 1992. The proposed project would constitute the
first Bank operation in Kazakhstan.
II. COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Characterisdcs and Recent Performance
3.           Backgrond. Kazkhstan is among the largest and potentially wealthiest counties of
the former Soviet Union (FSU). It has exensive and relatively unexploited resources including gold,
iron ore, copper, zinc, coal, gas, and oil. It also has vast agricultural lands and is self-ufficient in
food. Production and trade have been mostly directed towards mineral extraction and large-scale
agriculture. This country, of only 17 million people, has been one of the main suppliers of raw
materials to the FSU.
4.           Kazakhsan has a relatively extmended infrastructure and a highly educated work force,
an inheritance from the significant Union investment of the seventies. Social indicators are
comparable with upper middle income counties. Labor skdlls have been developed through on-the-
job trainig in the space industry, defense, and manufcti. In the future, they could provide the
basis for the development of skilled-labor-based industries.
5.           The former Union also left a legacy of constaints. While poverty was almost
nonexistent, productivity growth and the standard of living have been stagnant. Infastructure is
Iargely direhed toward Russia, at the expense of Kazak'stas potental trade orientation toward As!a
and the Middle East. Even domestically, infrastructure has been designed for the wider Union: oil
fields in the west are not linked to refineries in the east; northern and southern electricity grids are
not connected. Kazakhstan has also inherited extensive environmental problems: damage of pastoral
lands through excessive water use and ferilization, contamination resultimg from nuclear weapons
testing; and severe pollution stemming from mining and industry.



-2-
6.           After Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev was named head of the local Communixt Party in
1989, he became an influetial political leader within the Union as wel as the spokesperson for a
transitional political structre. Following independence, Mr. Nazarbayev has contined to provide
strong leadership as the first President of Kazakhstan. He has enlisted parliamentary support for
mnmerous reforms, maintaining political control and fostering stability. He has also used the
country's reatively balaced ethnic composition as a source of strength '. This is reflected in the new
Constiution tbat recognizes the rights of the Russian population while adopting, at the same time,
Kazakh as the official language. Foreign policy bas been balanced by maintaning close cooperation
with Rissia while expanding relations with Asian countries, as well as by Kazakistan's interest in
becoming a regional leader.
7.           Recent Developm_enand Polcy Iniives. In the past 18 months the Government
has shown commitment to steady reform. The first efforts to pnvatize trade and small firms
spearheaded reforms in late 1991. Changes in previous instiutional aangmes accompanied these
early reforms.
8.           Serious macroeconomic difficulties, however, developed during Kazakstan's first
year as an independen country. Real output fell by about 14 percent in 1992, and by a cumulative
30 pcent over 1990-92. Trade and paymes disruptions, the extreme inWegration of FSU
production, and the elimination of state orders have contributed to such decline. In 1992, the
contraction was compounded by a loss of about 8 percent of GDP in fisca transfers from the Union.
However, a strong post-drought rebound in agricultural production and large trade credits from
Russia in the third quarter, prevented a sharper decline.
9.           The country's decision to stay in the ruble zone ensured contined supply of credit
from Russia during 1992. While ruble credits were necessary to support domestic activity in the
absence of foreign financing, the lack of overall monetary discipline within the zone fueled a rapid
rise in inflation. For the year as a whole, consumer prices rose more than 26 times in k=khstan;
mnthy infation accelerated to around 30 percent by end-1992. Social pressures brought about by
the deterioration in living conditions, led the Govermment to relax its strict cash management system:
the consolidated budget turned from beig balanced during the first half of the year to a deficit of
about 9 pcent of GDP for 992 as a whole.
10.          Despite such considerable macroenomic difficulties, the Govemment has steadily
puued structural reforms. Prices of most goods were liberalized in January 1992. Some prices
coinued to be admnistered for social reasons as in most FSU countries. However, the Government
has continuously reduced the mnmber of goods subject to price control. Important goods that still
remain controlled in other FSU counties, Wlke meat and milk, were hlberalized in January 1993. Only
a few basic goods remamn under administered prices: brown flour, imported medicines, fodder, rents,
utilities and public transportation. Moreover, most adminisred prices have been substantially
adjusted. For exmple, rents of stae-owned property were increased tenfold in early 1993.
11.          There has also been rapid progress on privatizatlon. President Nazarbayev approved a
World Bank-upported privization program in early 1993. Most of the enablig legislation which
was necessay to suport the implementation of the program, around 30 implementtion texts and
1 Most of the population is evenly distributed between Kazakhs (40 percent) and Russians
(38 percent), with the remainder composed of other nationalities.



-3-
decrees, was approved by Parliament in April 1993. Tbis included a _mdme   to the old
privatization law and to the joint stock company law. Around 10 percn of state asset had been
already privatized by the end of the first quarter of 1993. The specific cmonents of the
Government's privatization program are described in para 28.
12.          The development of the pnvate sector is beig encouraged through the adoption of
extensive legal reforms and institutional building. The new Constiution was adopted in
January 1993 and establishes the legal basis for private ownership, which was not recognized under
the previous system. Other legislation has been enacted on companies, pledges, leases, ba yupt
and land reform.
13.          Most lcgal and institutional barriers to private participation in trade and distribution
have been removed. The number of goods covered by interrepublican trade arrangements, export
licenses and quotas were substantaliy reduced for 1993. There are no import quotas and import
duties range from 0 to 13 percent. Kazakhsn adopted a single unified exchange rate in July 1992,
and foreign exchange is available through the auction market. The system of compulsory state orders
governing the distribution of production was abolished in December 1992.
14.          Among the FSU, Kazakhstan has been in the forefront of opening the economy to
exteal direct foreign investment. An agreement was flnalized with Chevron to develop
Kazakhstan's Tenghiz oil field in April 1993. Tenghiz ranks along side some of the largest fields in
Saudi Arabia, with recoverable reserves estmated at between 6 and 9 billion barrels of oil. Initial
investment for this project is estimated at around US$1.5 billion. In June 1992, Bridtsh Gas and
Agip won exclusive nego ng rigbts to develop the K ananak field with 20 trillion cubic feet
of gas and 2 bilUon barrels of oil and condensate. If negotiations are concluded successfully , this
agreemnt would involve investment of similar imporance to that by Chevron. Other foreign
investors are exploring the potendal development of an oil export pipeline which would connect
Kazakhstan with international markets, as well as the potential development of hydrocarbons reserves
under the Caspian Sea.
15.          Reforms in the financial sector have also started. New central bank and commercial
bank legislation have been approved, credit auctions have been ntroducd to increase competition in
the allocation of funds, and new prudental supervision standards have been established. In
April 1993, Parliament approved new stautes for the National Bank of the Republic of Kakbstan
(NBRK), a law on banking activities and a new foreign carency law. The new NBRK act gives the
cetal bank increased indqendce from government, establishes the legal foundation for the
conduct of monetary and credit policies, and provides the NBRK with the authority to regulate and
supervise the bankdng system.
16.          The new commercial banking law defines the broad principles of the bankng system
and provides the first basis for transforming the existig banking system of about 180 mostly state and
enterprise owned banks into efficient market-oriented banks. Minimum capital requirements for
banks have been raised, exposure limits reduced and shareholder rs tightened. The central
bank begun auctioning credit in January 1993 as a first step away from directed credit allocation.
17.          Outside of the oil and gas sector, sectoral reforms have been limited. The
Government has only just begun considering their reform strategy for the coal and power sectors.
Similarly, despite offering significant export earnings potential, reforms in the mining sectr have



-4-
been limited to inased operating indepence. The Government has not yet articulated a
consistent vision for agricultural reform either. Reforms so far have focwssed on removing most
administrative price controls and reducing price subsidies.
B. Country Developmet Objectives and Policies
18.          The challenge for the fi=re is for the Govermment to mainain the momentum for
reform through firther implementation of the remang reform agenda. The Government is pur g
a two-pronged approach to reforms. First, it will seek to stabflize the economy and reduce inflon.
Second, through the acceleration of structural and sectoral reforms it will seek to promote an early
supply response in key areas. The key structural reforms consist of:
(i)    Enterprise reform, by accelerating the privatiation program, and attaining better
governance of enterprises that will remain under state ownership;
(u)    Further improvement of the incentive framewoik to improve resource reallocaton,
foster private sector de, elopment, and competition;
(iii)   Fiaxial sector reforms to support enterprise restuctring and private sector
development; and,
(iv)   Establishment of a social safety net that succeeds in protecting vulnerable groups,
while remaining consistent with macroeconomic stabiLity.
19.          Key sectoral policies include the development of energy, mining and metallurgy.
These sectors should generate crtical export earnings during the early stages of the transition. The
Govermnent also wants to promote agricultural sector growth given Its importance in generating
employment, food security, and export growth. Within infrastructure, special attention is given to
tlecommunications and transportaton as they are necessary to support export growth and private
sector develo.- ient.
Macroecononic Stabilization
20.          The Goverment is preparing a program with the IMF, to access its Systemic
Transformation Facility (STF) as a first step towards a full stand-by arrangement. The program's
objectives are to. (i) bring down monthly inflation to single digits by the end of the year in line with
the target agreed with Russia under its STF; (ii) reduce the budget deficit; (iii) contain output decline
to around 7-8 percent during 1993; and (iv) strengthen the balance of payments, significantly
increasing the level of intemational reserves by end 1993. The realization of these objectives needs to
be supported by a combination of tight financial policies and increased access to foreign fiancing.
21.           Given the importance of macroeconomic stability, Kkstan will remain in the
ruble zone only if there is an overall agreement and progress on monetary stabilization. The
Govenment is currently trying to develop such agreement in coordination with other members of the
ruble zone. At the same tme, NBRK's capacity to eventually conduct an independent monetary
policy is being stengthened, includig its technical capability to issue and manage its own currency,
should monetary stability be unachieveable within the ruble zone.
22.          Similarly, the Goverment is committed to reducing the budget deficit. The projected
budget deficit reuction, from 9 to 6 percent of GDP, is substantial specially when takdng into account
rising expenditure demands and contractionary pressures on the revemne base. The tax and



-5-
expenditure measures underlying the program were approved by Parliament in April 1993. On fiscal
measures the tax base has been widened and the efficiency of tax collection improved. Specifically,
the Government has merged the tax collection and customs agencies, introduced new excise taxes and
removed tax exemptions.
23.           To control expenditur%s, the Government has reintroduced the cash management
system of the fist half of 1992 and is targeting social expenditures. Almost one third of
Kazaldstan's GDP used to be spent on social services, health, education, family support and food
subsidies. The pressure for social expenditures is expected to grow as hidden unemployment was
already estimated at around 120,000 in June 1993. The Government is, therefore, designing a
rationalization of social services and a safety net to help rzrige the expected surge in the number of
workers who may be adversely affected as adjustment intensifies.
24.           Almost two-thirds of the budget deficit is to be financed through the banking system.
Nan-inflationary sources of deficit financing are virtually nonexistent in Kazakhstan. Therefore,
some of the fiscal ct,ficit will need to be financed by external sources. The fiscal contraction will also
be supported by restrictive incomes policy: real wages are projected to stay slightly below current
levels.
Sructural Reforms
25.          Sustainable macroeconomic stability can only be achitved with the support of
structural reforms. The strategy is to move on three fronts: privatization, enterprise reform, and
assistance to the development of new business.
26.          Privatizatlon. As discussed eirlier (pam. 1l), the Government has already approved a
new comprehensive blueprint for privatization of state enterprises (SEs). This revised program is
meant to accelerate privatization, distribute assets among all citizens through the use of coupons, and
create more effective corporate governance after privatization. Most of the program should be
implemented over the next 3 years. It envisages: (i) the rapid sale or auction of around 27,000 small-
scale enterprises, such as shops and restaurants.2 Sales will be done through municipal auctions or
tenders of assets. Competition in wholesale and trucking will be ensured through segmenation and
auctions; (ii) the mass privatization of around 7,000 medium-sized enterprises. Most shares will be
auctioned to pnvate investment funds, where Kazakhtan's citizens will invest pointm d
privatization coupons; and (iii) case-by-case privatization of up to 200 large enterprises, somedmes
with prior restructring, and of other enterprises in sectors that require fundamental changes in the
regulatory framework prior to privatization.
27.          The Govermnent's focus has now shifted to the implementation of the privatization
program; significant foreign technical assistance support is required at this stage. Small-scale
privatization, which started 18 months ago, is expected to be largely completed by end 1994. The
mass privatization program, planned to start in the second half of 1993, should be concluded within
three years. For large SEs, although privatization has already begun, it will take longer to complete.
The first international tender for the privatization of a major tobacco company was issued late
June 1993.
2 Enterprises are classified by nunber of employees: small scale have less than 200, medium
scale between 200 to 5000, and large more than 5000 employees.



28.          The Govermment's enterpise reform program seeks to: (i) improve corporate
goveriance of SEs remaining in the public sector; (ii) titen flnancial control by making subsidies
explicit, phasing them down; and, (iii) actively support post-privatizaton restructuring.
29.          To strengthen goverance, medium and large-scale SEs will be converted to joint
stock companies with proper legal status, property rights, and functional boards of directors.
Moreover, the State Committee for State Property (SCSP) plans to introduce a system to monitor,
assess, and promote tha fnancial performance of SEs. The SCSP will exercise the state's remaining
ownership rights, relying on market competition to constrain monopoly abuse.
30.          To improve fiancial control over SEs, the Government will first make transfers
explicit, timebound, and with clear financial accountability. It will then reduce them over time.
Moreover, once auditing, accounting and bankruptcy regulations become functional, the bankdig
sector will be better equipped to impose financial discipline on SEs. However, like other economies
in transition, Kazakhstan will probably need to subsidize some SEs in the short-term to keep viable
firms solvent.
31.          Private Sector Development. The Government's program to promote private
enterprises includes the completion of en enabling regulatory framework, ensuring post-privatization
support, and promotng competition.
32.          A one-stop system for foreign investment processing and licensing has recently been
established. The Govermnent expects PDI to play an important role in the development of the
productive base. Foreign investment is also being pursued in the financial sector: IFC is expected to
support the establishment of the first foreign bank in Kazakhstan, in the second half of 1993. A
revised natural resource exploitation legislation will be presented to Parliament in the second half of
1993. A new retroleum law and a tax regime are being designed, and a new foreign direct inveshtent
law is also expected to be approved by Parliament in late 1993. A new framework for contracts will
be incorporated in a redrafted civil code.
33.          Most enterprise restructuring will be undertake by the private sector since the
Government's pre-privatization program will only involve changes in management, segmentation, and
partdal liquidation. The Government is considering various options to support post-privatzaion
resructuing. A new institution to provide the private sector with equity and term-financing for
e:rturing and new investment, is one of those options. The Government, however, would restrict
access to new funds to those privatized firms that have a viable restuctuing plan. While these
resources would norually be provided by the financial sector, some banks may be capable of on-
lending such fimds but only to a limited extent. Such a program, therefore, would only be viable
with the support of the international financial community.
34.          The next steps to strengthen competition are to design and implement a relatively open
trade regime and to continue promoting direct foreign investment. Following the Government's
request to UNDP to participate in the Trade Expansion Program (TMP), the terms of reference of the
study have been recently discussed with the Govermment and the main mission is expected in October.
The TEP will provide the main elements of a blueprint for trade reform, by end of 1993. The agenda
will cover the liberalization of both domestic and foreign markets.
35.          Finanal Sector. In addition to increased NBRK independence and improved
standards (para 16-17), the Govermment wants to have an efficient payments system and a rapid



-7-
transfer of international banking tecbniques and skills. It is working closely with the Bank on
improving the efficiency of the domestic payments system with new investment in the payments
inrastructure in the country. It also intends to transfer implicit interest rate subsidies out of the
banking system to explicit budget transfers.
36.          Extensive institutional development will come about from the expertise that will be
built up in improving banking standards and prudential requirements. The introduction of
international banking standards will support the emergence of the core banks which will form the
basis of the new financial system. Former state banks will become less important as directed credit is
phased out and bad loans are written off their books.
37.          While the outstanding debt stock of SEs has been eroded by past inflation, a
significant number of firms may become loss-makers with reforms. Moreover, as iflation is
controlled, their debt will build up in real terms. Although most of this debt will be handled by the
banking sector, for a few very large SEs the Government is considering the establishment of a debt
recovery fimd. Bad loans would be transferred to ths restructuring fumd or bank, where debt
workouts and fiuther funding would be made available before privatization, conditional on
restruring and/or liquidation. In most cases, however, the Goverment will seek to privatize the
enterprise.
38.          Sodal Safety Net. The Government wants to sustain a minimum level of social
protection and have the institutional capacity to respond to the possibility of higher volumes of
unemployment. Government spending on social transfers, social services, health, education, family
support and food subsidies have already dropped from 30 to around 15 percent of GDP. The
Government has started to move away from universal towards targeted entidements. It plans to
inrease its targeting efforts by extending them to most social welfare payments. It has also started an
assessment of the efficiency of social expenditures in the context of the preparation of the 94 budget.
it is also exploring possibilities for the creation of a private pension scheme and the introduction of
health insurance.
39.          Unemployment, is still less than I percent. However, it could rapidly grow over the
next twelve months, as experienced in Eastern European countries. Higher unemployment will put
additional pressure on the budget. The Govermnent is reassessing the use of payroll taxes as the
primary source of funding unemployment compensation. While some basic ifastuctural capacity
already exists to deal with an unemployment surge, institutional arrangements for employment
services in Kazakhstan will be strengthened.
40.          Local Govermnents will increasingly assume responsibility for those social services
currenly provided by enis. Although the Government wants to channel assistance to these
local bodies and regional oblasts, it has not yet developed a strategy. It is, however, designing and
evaluatng alternative restructuring options for health, education and provision of social senrices in
general. Among others, it is considering the development of new financing systems, including self-
funding insurance schemes for some segments of the population and for some social services.
Sectora Reforms
41.          The timely development of already agreed investment projects in mining and energy
(para 14 ) should ensure a supply response in these sectors, firom the energy and mining sectors.



-8-
The resulting expansion in exports should be the basis for Kazakhstan's improved creditworthiness
over the medium-term.
42.          To support FDI in the energy sector, the Government is developing the necessary
institutional and regulatory envirownent. It is also preparing a taxation regime which ensures the state
receives its fair share of extraction rents. Energy licensing arrangements have been revised and new
petroleum legalization is being drafted. In parallel to restructuring existing oil enterprises, the
Govenment is encouraging the development of an export pipeline to reduce Kazkhstan's dependence
on the Russian distribution system.
43.          The Govermnent has also started similar legal, institutional and taxation reform in the
mining sector. It is actively encouraging foreign participation in the sector in order to improve the
returns from the country's rich deposits of chromite and its processing into ferro-chrome and zinc,
where Kazakhstan could become a significant player in world markets. There is potential for new
greenfield mining projects in other minerals (such as gold), where foreign participation is also
encouraged. The Govermnent will identify specific restructuring and rehabilitation needs within
energy and mining, to improve the reliability and quality of supply.
44.          An efficient telecommunications and transportation network will promote integration
with intenational markets and open some sectors to increased competition. The Govermment's initial
focus is to maintain and rehabilitate existing systems. In telecommunications, the strategy is to attract
foreign investment to upgrade international services. Government investment will be needed to
upgrade domestic services if foreign participation cannot be encouraged.
45.          In the transport sector, the Government's priority is to contain the deterioration in the
quality of urban transport services and promote investment in either existing or new transport
networks. Within these activities, it wants to improve cost recovery and promote private sector
participation.
46.          Although the Government recognizes the importance of agriculture, which accounts
for a third of GDP, it has not yet articulated a clear reform strategy. The Government has planned to
start by rehabilitating the exisdng irrigation system and introducing new technologies. Although some
reforms have been already undertaken - prices have been liberalized and long-term leases introduced-
- the state and collective farms need more substantive reforms. They include restructuring the
governance and ownership of collective and state farms, with particular emphasis on privadzation.
The lack of a program for agriculture reform is a gap in the Government's medium-term strategy.
Medium-Term Prospects
47.          Kazakhstan's rich resource base, and well-educated work force could provide the basis
for strong and sustained growth. Yet, the experience of economies in transition suggests that
recovery takes time, since resources are reallocated away from a large E sector to a new, much
smaller, private sector. Output is expected to continue declining into 1994 (Table 1). First, energy
developments will be capital intensive. They will have limited spillover effect in the short term.
Second, some contraction will result from enterprise restructuring and privatization, and the tightening
of financial discipline. GDP growth, of around 3 to 4 percent, could be achieved in the second half
of the 1990s, if macroeconomic stabilization as well as structural and sectoral reforms are
implemented as envisaged.

48.          In the short term, growth could be driven by services and agriculture. Growth in
services may be quick to come about as this sector is underdeveloped in Kazakhstan, like in other
FSU econonies. Some growth in business and consumer services has already occurred. A quick
suWly response could also come about from agriculture, but only once the colective and state farms
are reformed. Given the lack of an agricultural reform strategy (par 46) the medium-term
contribution of agriculture to growth in the projections above is negligible.
49.          External financing requirements are expected to peak in the early years of the
transition, while exports are still low and the private sector is stil small. Also, domestic resource
mobilization to finance rruring and the social safety net wil be difficult during the inital years.
Foreign financing could play an important role in supporting restructuring and non-inlationary
financing of the budget deficit during the transition period.
50.          The economy's net savings position should improve as reforms begin to bear their
fruits. Energy, mining, and agricultural exports should turn around the trade deficit into surplus,
resulting in a shrinking current account imbalance in the second half of the 1990s. FDI in energy
should account for around half of all capital inflows by 1996. Kazakhstan's need for fimancing from
multlateral and bilateral sources should gradually decline, as the country gets access to international
capital markets and starts relying on export credits and private capital flows.
51.          Russia and Kazakhstan have not agreed yet on a zero debt option, despite Russia's
recent agreement with the Paris Club. Discussions are continuing over the value of the FSU's assets.
However, even without a zero debt agreement the debt service ratio would remain around
10 percent over the next four years before dropping slightly in the second half of the 1990s. If, as
expected, Kazakhstan concludes a zero option agreement with Russia, debt service payments would be
reduced to around 1.3 percent of exports of goods and services in 1993, from 8.4 percent in 1992.



-10-
Over time, the current account deficit would be reduced from around 10 percent of GDP in 1992 to
around 5 percent in 1996. Total financing requirements would be around US$2.4 billion for 1993
and between US$1.7 and US$2 billion for 1994. This would be financed by: around US$500 million
of PDI in 1993, and US$900 million in 1994; US$1 billion of muldlateral, bilateral and export credits
in 1993 and around US$600 million in 1994 (Table 2). If Kazakhstan reaches an agreement with
Russia on a zero-debt option, financing requirements for the second half of 1993 would fall to
around US$300 to US$350 million; for 1994 at around US$450 to US$500 million. As negotiations
between Kazhtan and Russia are still ongoing, projections in Table 2, however, assume that there
is no zero-debt agreement because

52.           Kazakbstan risks and uncertintes stem from the extenal environment, the ruble
zone, and domestic imple ion issues. Exteal envioment factors which could affect the
economy include adverse commodity price movements ( for oil, copper, and grain), a firther
deterioration in the global economy, and a shortfall in either eral financing or foreign direct
investment flows.
53.           Kazakhstan's relatively promising transition path is heavily dependent on the country's
ability to sell its products at world prces. The envisaged adjustment profile is, therefore, sensitive to
the future price of oil. It is also dependent, although to a lesser extent, on international prices for



-11-
copper, chromite, lead and zinc. A fall in crude oil price would substantally reduce both exports
(widening the financing gap) and fiscal receipts to the Govermnent (widening the budget deficit).
For example, a US$1 per barrel decline in oil prices would reduce Kazakhstan's export revenues by
approximately US$200 million in 1994, or about 3 percent of export receipts.
54.          Similarly, Kazakhstan's ability to increase its exports of oil products to markets
outside of the PSU is dependent on the constucton of an export pipeline. Delays in the construction
of the pipeline would limit oil exports to non-FSU markets and delay the overall economic recovery.
The Government understands the critical role of the pipeline for export growth as well as for the
dmely inmplementation of FDI-financed oil projects. It expects to reach closure on a pipeline project
shortly.
55.          Contued instability in the ruble zone poses a significant risk to Kal khstan's ability
to stabilize the economy. As long as Kazakhstan remains within the ruhle zone, it will not be able to
manage independenty its credit and monetary policy. nability to stabilize the ruble zone would,
therefore, flow over into Kanltan  and affect its stabilization program. Strucural adjustment and
restcturing would become more difficult in an environment of high inflation and relative price
variability, which confuses price signals for producers, affects investment decisions, and provides
little incentive to save. In these circumstances, Kazakhstan may choose to leave the ruble zone. The
authorities have already taken steps to be prepared to issue their own currency should this risk
nmteraize.
56.          C       _  to Reform. The Government will have to display contiued resolve if
unemployment grows, real incomes decline, and previously favored groups loose access to subsidies
and cheap credits. Opposition to reform may derail either the structural reform program or budgetary
control. Sustained opposition by the old Nomenklatum to the imposition of increased financial
discipline and privatization and restuctring, may undennine the Government's efforts to develop a
market economy. The success of reforms depends on the ability of the Government to sustain support
for the program. This may be affected by developments elsewhere in the FSU, particularly in Russia.
In the event that the program is undermined, it would lead to reductions in external support and delay
recovery in GDP.
57.          Ipementatin Capacity. The pace of reforms may be constrained by the
Government's limited experience with a market economy. Therefore, the provision of technical
assistance to support the implementation of reforms will be essential. The Governmen has requested
technical assistance from nmultilateral and bilateral sources for the formulation of an agenda for reform
including detailed advice on privatization, the financial sector, energy and the social sectors. Given
the rapid approval of so many policy initiatives, however, limited technical capabilities on the
Govemment's side could become a constraint. If progress in implementation were to be obstructed
because of limited absorptive capacity, technical assistance should be fiurter focussed only on the
implementation of the privatization program and energy sector reforms, since these are the most
important sources of growth in the short term.
D. World Bank Country Asstn  Srate
58.          The formulation of the Bank's strategy for Kazakhstan is at an early stage. In
pardicular, while the Bank's u sta     of the energy, enterprise, and financial sectors is reladvely
well developed, our knowledge of the agricultural sector and social safety net issues is curenty



-12-
limited. The assistance program to Kazakstan has been designed to provide early and strong
support to the Government's program through policy advice, economic and sector work (ESW), and
lending in the following areas:
(i)    Macroeconomic stabilization through balance of payments support;
(ii)    StutWlS reforms through enterprise restrucring, privatization, and financial sector
reforms;
(iii) Protection of the poor through an effective social safety net;
(iv)   Sectoral reforms through operations in energy, agriculture, infrastructure, and
environment; and,
(v)    Institution building and reinforcement of the Government's implementation capacity,
including the establishment of an agency to manage external assistance.
59.          Future Assstance. Kazakhstan is in the midst of preparing a macroeconomic
stabilization program to be supported by the STF of the IMF. Provided the stabilization program is
accompanied by a framework of further structural reforms, the Bank plans to process quicldy a
rehabilitation loan of US$180 million designed to finance critical imports. After the overall program
is in place, several scenarios may emerge. To best manage the emerging uncertainties, while
remaining flexible, the Bank program has been designed for three altemative scenarios which are part
of a continm. Each scenario has different lending amounts and diferent lending instruments. The
scenarios-a high, an intermediate and a low case-are triggered by specific actions.
60.          The Intenmediate Case Continued government commitment to the broad thrust of
the strucur and sectoral reform program would be part of the intermediate case. This case is,
however, triggered by the achievement of stabilization at a gradual but slower pace than agreed, and
continued progress in implementing the existing privatization program-particularly with the small and
medium-scale privatization component and the sale of the state trucldng and distribution networks.
61.          Under this scenario, seven to eight projects are planned during FY94 to FY96 in
addtion to the rehabilitation loan. Total lending for these years could be in range of US$500 to
US$700 million. In this scenario, the Bank will focus on a program of investment lending, training
and technical assistance which is described below. Investment projects would focus on sectors where
reforms may elicit a supply response even under some macroeconomic instability.
62.          The investment program under this scenario would include projects in the energy and
agriculture sectors, and would be aimed at promoting private sector participation, provided enough
progress is made in the price regime and in allowing entry into agricultural markeig and
distribution. Investment in infrastructure projects would continue to support the emerging private
sector and develop Kazakhstan's transportation links with the rest of the world. The program would
also include investments in human resources.
63.          An important aspect of the first phase of the Bank's planned assistance strategy is the
development of the Government's institutional capacity and technical capabilities. The proposed
US$38 million technical assistance loan, discussed in section II of this memorandum was developed to
support the Government in the design and implementtion of its reform program. The technical
assistance loan would lay the basis for several subsequent Bank operations. The US$50 million.i
Financial and Enterprise Sectors Development Project planned in FY94, primarily focuses on
increasing the efficiency of transactions in the economy through the modernization of the structure,
software, and hardware of the payments system. It would also provide technical assistance for reform



-13-
in the financial and entetprise sectors. On the enterprise reform side, the project would support the
design of large enterprise restructuring; training in modem management and business techiques;
strengthening of private business services; and development and implementation of restructuring plans
for the presently specialized banks.
64.          In the area of human resource development, a FY95 Human Resources operion
would focus on developing the capacity of relevant Government agencies to design and implement a
targeted and cost-effective system of social protection. A significant training component would also
be developed. Aention would also be given to deepening the capacity and enhancing the efficiency of
the country's employment services. The Bank's strategy in this area will be better defined following
further sector work.
65.          The Bank's operations in the energy sector are initially focused on the oil industry
with the following four objectives: (i) developing an appropriate legal and insdtutional environment;
(ii) halting the decline in output and underpinning export revenue generation; (ill) catalyzing new
capital-domestic and foreign-into existing oil and gas fields; and (iv) assisting the Government with
alternative transportation routes which would decrease Kazakhstan's dependence on the existing FSU
network. There are two operations currently under design. A technical assistance loan of around
US$20 million for FY94 to support resructuing of the sector, and a second operation for FY95 of
around US$150 million designed to rehabilitate and halt the decline in production from the Uzen oil
field. A power sector operation is envisaged in FY97.
66.          As current knowledge of the agriclture sector is limited, a sector review will be
carried out in the coming year in conjunction with the preparation of an FY96 irrigation rehabilitation
project. The irrigation project is expected to promote output growth, water savings in a region of
relative scarcity, employment during the operation, and develop the capacity of local contractors with
large projects. Another agricultural operation, while dependent on the sector work and discussions
with the authorities, could be prepared around the same time, potentially focusing on the restucuing
of state and collective farms, on distribution and input botdenecks, and on extension services.
67.          Operations to rehabilitate inftastructure will first focus on a US$30 million urban
transport loan. The loan is aimed at restoring critical urban transport services in the three largest
cities in Kazaknst. Services in these cities have declined sharply following the collapse in trade and
restricted access to key imports. The operation would also promote policy reforms and institutional
restructuring in the sector.
68.          Consistent with the objective of increased water use efficiency, the Bank will focus on
the design and implementtion of policy to address the effects of the Aral Sea environmenal calamity.
An international conference was held on April 26, 19933 to discuss Environmental Action Plan to be
developed in FY94 to address these issues and to help the Government improve environmental
policies and regulations. This work would be supported by other sector work on agriculture and by
the Bank's regional work on the Aral Sea. A strategic view that explicitly links the solution of the
Aral Sea problems to the broader macro and sectoral transformation in the Region needs to be
developed within the context of the proposed Arat Sea Environmental Assistance Program. The
program would include components dealing with the rehabilitation and development of the Aral Sea
3 Organized by the Bank in collaboration with the UNEP and the UNDP.



-14-
disaster zone, strategic planning and comprehensive management of water resowres, and institutional
developmen.
69.          The High Case. Should Kazakhstan move beyond the STF to a strong stabilization
program supported by an upper-tranche standby with the IMP, the Bank's lending program would
move into a high case scenario. This scenario assumes also that the government makes rapid progress
with structural and secoral reforms: rapid progress is made with the privaizaton of small and
medium enterprises, and steady progress is made with the more difficult larger scale privatization
program; further price adjustment takes place, particularly the fiul pass-through of energy costs and
increase in imported utility prices and housing rentals; and actions to reduce the role of the state in
distnrbution and marketing are accelerated. The start of a coherent reform program in agriculture also
becomes a crucial component of this scenario.
70.          In addition to the rehabilitation loan and the seven investment and technical assistance
loans under the imntediate case, the high case would consider two additional adjustment operations-
probably one SAL and one SECAL. The potenial coverage of these operations will evolve in
discussions with the authorities; potentil areas of focus may include trade policy, enterprise and
finncial secor reform, public investment reform and social policy. Total lending under this scenario
would be about US$1 billion.
71.          The Low Case. The low case is triggered by rapid deterioration in the Governme's
stabilization program and its inability to implement structural reforms. This scenario would not be
sustainable as it will lead to a sharp contraction in the economy and deterioration in the standard of
living of the people. In this case, the lending program would drop to three to four additional
projects, totalling US$100-200 million during FY94-96. The lending program would comprise
technical assistance and instituion-building operations, and perhaps one or two investment projects
focussing on key Inftrucu. These investment projects would aim to maintain and reh ate
basic service levels, to avoid the collapse of key infastructure where postponement of maintenance
would increase its cost in the fiture. For FY94, in addition to the proposed tecbnical assistance loan,
there would be technical assistance operations in support of energy. For FY95, one operation would
focus only on the hulman reurces sector. For PY96, there would be some support to agriculture
through technical assistance or ifrastructure rehabilitation.
72.          Economic and Sector Worl. ESW should provide the analytical underpinning for
i~ the Baek's policy discussions with the Government and for futlre lending operatons. In close
coordination with the lMP and with multeral insttutions, the Bank's work would conte to focus
on the sectoral and structural elements of the reform program. A second CEM is planned in FY94,
and future CEMs are planned for FY95 and FY96. The second CEM would contine to develop the
reform agenda with the Government, be a major input in the ned Consultative Group meeting and
inform the Executive Directors of the Govermnent's progress. In addition, it would lay the
analytical groundwork for the policy dialogue underpinning a possible future adjustment operation.
Similarly, sector work which is already under way in the energy, enteprise, and financial sectors,
and that envisaged in the agriculture and social sectors should provide the foundation for forthcoming
operations, enhance our understanding of these sectors, and help focus the Bank's strategy. The work
already undertaken in the privatiztion and energy sectors, in particular, suggests that the Bank's
ESW would need to be flexible to respond to the changing needs and emphases of the Government
during these early transition stages.



-15-
73.          The Government has received funding from the UNDP to participate m a Trade
Expansion Program (rEP). This program, executed by the Bank, has been successful in other
countries. It would help provide the blueprint for future trade reform (pan 35). The advantage of
the TEP is that its terms of reference are developed by the main agencies involved in the reform
program and thus they typically assume ownership of the resulting agenda for trade reform.
74.          Portfolio Mana        The Ba's strategy, based on the lessons from the
experience of other economies in transition, is to design projects so as to minimize potential
implementation problems. This requires emphasis on building up the institutional capacities to
manage and implement projects. The Govemment has set up a project implementation unit (PM) in
the Ministry of Economy to ensure the efficient disburement of the proposed loan. Training needs of
local staff in procurement, disbursem t, and finanil management would be given particular
attention. As the portfolio develops, through the Mid-Term Review and Country Implementation
Reviews, implementation issues would be closely examined with a view to facilitating the design of
flture operations. Given the inexperience of the authorities with Bank operations, high supervision
has been planned for the proposed technical assistance loan and subsequent operations. The -
establishment of a resident mission in Almaty, which is expected to be operational in October 1993,
would also assist with the effective management and supervision of the portfolio as it develops.
75.          Other Bnk Group Acties. Kazakhstan also applied for membership in IFC and
MIGA and indicated its acceptance of share subscription. Membership resolutions were approved by
the Board of both organizations. While receipt of the doumntaton is still pending, payment of
Kazakhstan's membership subscription has been. made. On the basis of the findings of the first EC
missions to Kazakhstan, priority areas for IPC involvement include assistance to small-scale
businesses through the setting up of commercial bans and leasing companies, mining activities,
infrastructure, telecommunications, and hotels.
76.          Coordinton of Extrnal Astance. The Bank, together with the EC and the
UNDP, is assisting the Government of Kazakbstan in establishing an External Assistance Management
Unit within the new Ministry of Economy. The Unit is to coordinate all liaison with donors, avoid
overlap of assistance and alocate scarce aid resources among priority uses.
77.          The establishment of a Consultative Group (CO) has been a critical element in helping
the Government determine its assistance needs. The first meetig of the Consultative Group for
Kaakbstan which was held in Paris on December 14, 1992 and was chaired by the Bank, provided
the Government of Kazahstan. with an opportunity to present its reform program to the international
community. The Goverment also presented its exMal financing requiments in the form of quick-
disbursing balance of payments support, investment fancing, and technical assistance. While the
absence of an agreed stabilization program with the IMP prevented firm pledges from being made at
the time, the meetng was successful in defining Kazakstan's financing needs and identilying likely
fuure financing sources.
78.          The CG meeting was part of a process that has seen extensive follow-up in the first
half of 1993. A local CG meeting in Almaty took place on May 21, 1993 and focused on the
affangements for eternal assistance management, technical assistance coordination and technical
assistance in the energy sector. Once a stabilization agreement is in place, potental creditors would
be reconvened for a formal pledging session in Washington. It is expected that Kazakhstan's
financing needs would be met by both bilateral and multilateral conbtions.



-16-
79.          Close coordination has been nuainained between the Bank and the IMP, UNDP, EC,
EBRD, OECD, and other multilateral agencies to ensure the efficient use of external assistance.
Considerable effort has been devoted to sharing information with donors, both formally and
infornally, to _emin   the risk of duplication of activities.
E. Agenda for Dscuson
80.          The Bank's strategy is based on three scenarios that are triggered by alternative policy
performances. These scenarios are also based on the Bank's best judgment of future exogenous
developments over the next two to three years. There are, however, significant uncertainties and risks
in Kazakhstan, as there are in all other FSU republics. The challenge to the Bank's program is to
have the flexibility to respond to changing circmstances and to unexpected shifts in expected
outcomes.
81.          The Board may like to discuss the following issues:
(a)    The importance of additional structural reforms as a trigger for the high case.
(b)    What should be the Bank's response to a shorll in extnal financing under the high
case?
(c)    The low case is not a sustnable scenario for Kazakhstan. Is the proposed sharp
reduction in Bank activities in this case appropriate?
MI. THE TECHNICAL ASS1STANCE PROJECT
82.          Background and Project Raionale. The design of the reform program has
generated a fruitfl dalogue with the IMP and the Bank, and importnt measures are being discussed
to foster monetary and fiscal discipline and stabilize the economy. The IMP is currnatly working on
an arrangement with the Government to support the reform program, and the Bank is also considering
support to a program of systemic and structural reforms through a series of loans. The Bank has also
worked to coordinate aid with other donors and aid organizations, including the IMP, EC, EBRD,
and USAID, both through working sessions and in the context of the Consultative Group meeting held
in December, 1992. The Bank is concerned, however, that public support, and hence continued
implementation of, Kazakhstan's economic reform program is dtreatened by growing dissatisfaction
and frustation. Efforts aimed at providing sustained support to the reform program, as well as
directy contnbuting to economic output and well-being, are felt to be critical. This first Bank
operation would, therefore, support an initial program of technical assistance in a number of key
areas to assist in the design of the reform program and build up the institutional capacity and skills
needed in a market enviroment. Further Bank support could be provided in the form of investment
loans in selected sectors, and a Rehabilitation Loan could be proposed once full agreement has been
reached on the macroeconomic framework.
83.          Project Objectives. The objectives of the Loan are to: (i) provide assistance in the
design and development of the Government's reform policies and programs; (ii) help build the
institutional capacity and skills base to carry out these reforms; and (iii) initiate policy work for the
development of key sectos.



-17-
84.          Project Description. The proposed Loan would finance technical assistance and
selected equipment needs in the amount of US$38 million for:
A  PWvaat#on and Private Sector Dewlopment T"hnical assistance would be provided
to: (i) continue development of the Government's privatization program and assist in its
implemenation, with a particular emphasis on mass privatization; (ii) encourage competition
tbre -gh improvement of antimonopoly policies; and (iii) improve the policy and fiscal regime
for foreign investment.
B. Inandal Sector Moderriaon. Technical assistance would be provided to:
(i) moenize the country's payment system; (ii) continue development of banking and related
legislation; (iii) modernize bank accounting and auditing; and (iv) study the reorganiion of
the banking system, particularly as related to specialized financial service needs.
C  Soca Sector and Hwmwa Resources Development. Technical assistance would be
provided to: (i) design and implement policies and programs to provide unemployment relief;
iroduce social protection polici-.s targeted to the most vulnerable groups of society; and
develoP mechasms for poverty monitoring; (ii) develop new policies and programs n health
care reform; and (iii) provide training in areas where senous skills gaps exist.
D. InstiUdonal Sappoa and Development. Technical assistance would be provided to:
(i) support the introduction of broadly based legal and regulatory reforms; and (ii) improve
strategies for   me na issues.
In addition, this loan would finance the establishment of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
to support the implementation of this Loan and future loans.
85.          Lesns of Expeience. Reviews of past multisectoral technical assistance loans with
a focus on institutonal building suggest that such projects are more successful if they are developed in
the context of the Govermnent's own instiutional development objectives. Other lessons stress the
need for (i) Government commitment and involvement in the specification of the program and project
administration; (ii) detailed terms of referece for expert assistance; (iii) provision of training prior
to the initiation of the program; and (iv) intensive supervision of the operation by the Bank once
implementation has begun. The design of the proposed operation fully reflects the concern for
learning from past experience. The proposed program has been developed tbrough close collaboration
with the Kazakhstan authorities. The PIU was established early in the process within the Ministry of
Economy, and will be responsible for providing support to project implementation, particularly with
regard to procurement, disbursement, and project accountng. A number of Govenment officials,
including the senior staff of the PIU has begun work. Detailed terms of refrence for proposed
expert assistnce have already been drafted and discussed, and are annexed to the Staff Appraisal
Report. Further, adequate Bank resources will be devoted to project supervision and, in addition, the
PIU staff will be srengtheed in order to perform close and intensive day-to-day supervision.
86.          Project Adn ration. The Borrower will be the Republic of Kazakhstan. The
Govermment has appointed the Ministry of Economy to serve as the Lead Authority for the
management of the Loan and the coordination of its implemenation. The PIU has been established
within the Ministry of Economy. Responsibilities of the PIU include facilitating and monitoring
Project impleMntion, coordination among the various participating ministries and agencies to
ensre a consistent approach in the implementation of the project, the administaon of a Specal
Account, overall aontin ad auditg of project accounts, and preparaion of the consolidated
progres reports and the Project Completion Report. Specifically, while the conterpa miistries



-18-
will be responsible for the development of the terms of reference, short lists, bidding process and
negotating, signing, and executing conacts, the PIU will oversee the work of the counerpart
agencies in these areas, endorse the contracts,and approve disbursements. In order to ascertain
effective Project implementation, the Bank will approve the terms of reference of all studies and
programs financed under the Loan and the criteria for the selection of trainees. The Borrower and
the Bank will jointly review the findings of studies and the results of training programs. To enable
early project startup and efficient implementation, the loan provides retroactive financing of up to
10 percent of the loan amount for expenditure incurred since May 15, 1993, for goods and services
procured in accordance with the Bank's procurement practices.
87.          Eirom       l Aspects. As this project is not expected to have any significant
negative environmental impacts, it has been placed in Category C for the purposes of OD 4.01 on
Environental Assessment and does not require an environmental assessment. However,
environmental issues will be very important in Kazakhstan; problems in the Aral Sea basin and in
industrial and mi_g areas are already signifcant. Enironmental issues in the areas of privatization
and irrigation and land reclamation will be considered in this project. Assistance will be provided to
the Ministry of Ecology and Bioresources to assist in the development of a coordinated and consistent
program.
88.          Actions Agreed. The agreements reached at negotiations are on: (i) the program of
TA to be financed under the Loan; (ii) project costs and the financing plan; (iii) the project
arrangements, in particular as regards the establishment of the PIU, including the appointment of
critical staff, the introduction of acoundng and reportng systems, and procuremen arrangements;
(iv) arrangements for the appointment of auditors for the Loan; (v) arrangements for the Goverment
to provide the Bank with a statement showing all its foreign debt obligations and maintaining a system
of debt repordng; and (vi) that prior agreement will be sought with the Bank on: (a) the content of
training programs and criteria for the selection of trainees, (b) short list of consultants, and
(c) the terms of reference of studies. The fidings of these sudies will be discussed with the Bank.
As a condition of effectiveness, the Borrower will recruit two procurement consultants acceptable to
the Bank for the PMU.
89.          Befi and Rskb. The Goverment of Kazakhstan has embarked on an extensive
reform program, affecidg all sectrs of the economy. However, the Government currenly has
limited institutional capacity and shortage of the needed human resource skdlls to further design and
implement these reforms. It is imperative that the momentum of the reform program be condtued,
paricularly durimg this difficult period of transition, when isatisfaction and frustration with the
deteriorating economic and social situation is growing. The proposed Loan would provide critically
needed technical assistance at a crucial time to develop and implement key components in the
Governmfet's reform program, assurig the prompt and concerted development of the essential
components of a market economy.
90.          The main risks iclude: (i) the risk that some of the tehnicd assistance may be not
be fuly used or used to best advantage by those ministries which are slow in carrying out economic
reform; (ii) Kazakhstan's limited administrative capacity and lack of amliarity with Bank
prouemen and dishbrment proceres, which could limit absorptve capacity and lead to
significant delays; and (iii) delays in the enactment of new legislaion may hinder the oveall
implementation of the reform program. The technical assistance components provided to critical
ministries and agencies is aimed at assisting in the preparaion of their respective reform progms,
and is in direct support of the Government's priorities. Close supervision during implementation will
assure that inefficiencies are addressed as needed. Prcurement and disburement risks wiU be
reduced throgh close attention to pr e    and oth  implemeon consains during project



-19-
supervision. Substantial preparatory work has already been carried out to reform the legal
frvaework, and a number of new or revised laws are in the process of being preented to
Parliament. Close monitoring and selective assistance under the legal subcomponet would be aimed
at avoiding unnecessary delays in the introduction of fordtcoming legislation.
91.           e om       n.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan .
