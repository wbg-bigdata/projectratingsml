                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government of Jamaica continues to demonstrate strong commitment to the critical public sector reforms. The Government has made progress in implementation of most
                         reforms, albeit at a lower than expected pace, mostly due to the Parliamentary elections being called early and the subsequent change in Government. However, the most recent
                         supervision mission (February 23 - March 2) identified gaps in progress towards results in a number of areas, particularly the winding up of inactive Public Bodies, reducing the public
                         sector wage bill, and implementation of the new methodology for evaluating investment projects. The mission team highlighted these areas to the authorities, who confirmed their
                         commitment to address these areas and advance the overall reform program.
