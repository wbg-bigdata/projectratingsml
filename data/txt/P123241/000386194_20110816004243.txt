Borrower:        Jamaica
Implementing     Ministry of Finance
Agency:
                 IBRD Loan Amount: US$100 million
Financing        Terms: A US Dollar denominated, commitment-linked, Flexible Loan with a Fixed Spread,
Data:            with a custom repayment profile resulting in a 9.5 year Grace Period and 18.5 years Final

Operation
Type:            Second of two programmatic single-tranche Development Policy Loans (DPL)

Main Policy      The proposed operation supports Government efforts aimed at: (i) enhancing fiscal and
Areas:           debt sustainability; (ii) increasing the efficiency of public financial management and
                 budgeting processes; and (iii) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the tax system.
                  (i) The FY2011/12 budget process is developed within the Fiscal Responsibility
                 Framework (FRF) and is bound by the FRF’s medium term targets for debt creation and
                 the overall fiscal deficit;
                 (ii) A detailed borrowing plan is developed by the Debt Management Unit, which fully
                 operationalizes the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy; and quantitative limits on
Key Outcome      instruments and lenders are established in line with the overall budget ceiling established
Indicators       by the FRF;
(March 2012):     (iii) The Government has fully implemented the new methodology for evaluating capital
                 investments in six pilot ministries;
                 (iv) The six pilot Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) have submitted their
                 Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF);
                 (v) Improved PEFA rating of “Collection of tax payments? to B in FY2010/11 from a
                 baseline of: D+ in 2007/08.
                 The Program Development Objectives are:
                    Enhancing fiscal and debt sustainability, by supporting reforms to increase control on
                     public spending and debt generation, reduce debt service burden and improve debt
                     management, reduce financial vulnerabilities, and increase public spending
                     effectiveness.
Program             Increasing the efficiency of financial management and budget processes, by
Development          supporting efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditure and investment, and
Objectives           strengthen control of public finances and the effectiveness of government budgeting
and                  practices.
Contribution        Reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system, through reducing
to CPS:              the use of fiscal incentives and increasing the uniformity of the tax code, improving
                     client services for tax payers, broadening the tax base, and simplifying tax payments.
                 These efforts are particularly important for improving fiscal balances to create space for
                 productive expenditures and help foster growth in the medium term.
                 Contribution to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS): The proposed DPL is fully
                 consistent with the current World Bank Group CPS (2010-2013).

                                                  i
               There are four significant risks to the program supported by the proposed FSDPL2:
               Economic: Downside risks to the global economy could jeopardize the recovery in
               tourism and remittances and adversely affect credit markets and the reserve coverage.
               Growth is expected to be modest in the medium term and a slower recovery or adverse
               shocks could weaken fiscal balances and reduce the ability of the Government to continue
               implementing critical medium term reforms. The recent public sector salary increase,
               mandated by a Supreme Court decision, has further raised the wage bill to GDP ratio. The
               delays in completing reviews under the IMF program could affect progress towards
               medium-term fiscal targets. Mitigation: Since Jamaica is vulnerable to external shocks,
               prospects for mitigation are limited. However, following the debt exchange and the Stand-
               By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, external vulnerabilities have been reduced. Although
               the IMF reviews are delayed, the Government maintains a close dialogue with the IMF
               and is committed to medium-term fiscal sustainability. The Government is preparing a
               supplementary budget to finance the salary increase and is working to ensure the longer-
               term sustainability of the wage bill. The Bank will continue to monitor the situation
               through macro-monitoring and country dialogue.
               Political: The Government has a small majority in Parliament. Although new elections are
               not due until 2012, they could take place earlier. If political pressures were to increase, the
               Government may postpone necessary but potentially unpopular measures and some
               discretionary actions could be reversed. Recent security events have highlighted the
               sometimes fragile nature of the social compact in the country. Mitigation: The political
Risks and      risk is reduced by the Government’s consultative approach to reform implementation and
Risk           the broad agreement among all stakeholders that the pre-reform status quo was
Mitigation:    unsustainable. The Government is committed to addressing security challenges by
               developing and implementing a national safety and security strategy. The IFIs and other
               donors are heavily focused on building consensus for advancing critical public sector
               reforms.
               Institutional capacity and reform implementations: The Government’s reform program
               requires significant enhancement of institutional capacity. There may also be short-term
               delays in reform implementation if the Government decides to wait for the conclusion of
               the discussions on the draft Public Sector Rationalization plan of the Public Sector
               Transformation Unit (PSTU). Mitigation: Jamaica has well established institutions. The
               Government is committed to reform and the development partners are committed to
               providing support and technical assistance. The Bank has signed an agreement with DFID
               and secured £920,000 for technical assistance on institutional development including
               restructuring of the Debt Management Unit and Parliamentary oversight of public
               financial management.
               Natural disasters and climate change: Jamaica is highly vulnerable to natural disasters,
               in particular to droughts, floods, and hurricanes. The most recent tropical storm Nicole
               caused a fiscal cost of one percent of the GDP to the Government. Mitigation: The
               damage to major private sector enterprises is partly covered by private insurance and the
               Government participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. The Bank
               is assisting Jamaica through investments in natural disaster risk mitigation. With joint
               support from the WB and IADB, the Government is preparing a strategic program for
               climate adaptation under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR).

             IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
  PROPOSED SECOND PROGRAMMATIC FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
               DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                      TO JAMAICA

                                    I. INTRODUCTION
1.      This program document describes the proposed single-tranche Second
Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan (FSDPL2) in the amount of
US$100 million for Jamaica. The proposed operation builds on the progress made under the
Bank’s previous Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL (January 2009, P101321) and the First
Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL (FSDPL1, February 2010, P113893). The reform
program supported by the proposed DPL is the manifestation of the Jamaican Government’s
strategy to increase fiscal and debt sustainability, improve macroeconomic stability, and
accelerate growth. The reform program rests on three pillars: (i) enhancing fiscal and debt
sustainability; (ii) increasing the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting
processes; and (iii) reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system.
Reflecting the most pressing concerns at the time of operation preparation, the focus of the
Government’s program has been primarily on the first pillar of fiscal and debt sustainability.
However, the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has made significant progress towards achievement
of its objectives in each of these three areas, despite the difficult external environment and the
slow pace of recovery from the adverse effects of the global crisis.

2.       The GoJ remains committed to its medium term reform program under a
challenging environment. The GoJ recognizes the importance of improving macroeconomic
stability and paving the way for accelerated growth while protecting the poor. To this end, the
GoJ has developed a well-articulated medium-term economic program to improve fiscal
sustainability, reduce the debt overhang, and accelerate growth, while maintaining and even
expanding social spending to protect the most vulnerable groups. Despite the challenges created
by the severe impact of the global crisis, the security events in May/June 2010 and the tropical
storm Nicole in September 2010, the GoJ remained committed to its reform agenda.

3.      The macroeconomic environment was strengthened substantially by the successful
implementation of Government’s reforms. The Jamaica Debt Exchange (JDX), supported
under the FSDPL1, was a success with a participation ratio of 99.2 percent. The JDX contributed
to a reversal of exchange rate depreciation and lowered interest rates and inflation. The nominal
interest rates on Treasury Bills have fallen to the lowest levels in the last thirty years, reflecting
the improved confidence in the Jamaican economy and the Government’s program. The fiscal
and macroeconomic environment was further strengthened by the adoption of the Fiscal
Responsibility Framework (FRF) and a series of tax reforms aimed at increasing revenue
collection.

4.    The reform program of the GoJ received broad support from the International
Financial Institutions (IFIs), including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Jamaica has successfully
completed the first three reviews under the 27-month IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA),


                                                  1
approved in February 2010 in the amount of SDR820.5 million (300 percent of quota).
Completion of the third review on January 14, 2011, enabled the disbursement of SDR 31.9
million (US$49.3 million), bringing total disbursements to SDR 541.8million (US$838.2
million). Although the completion of the fourth and fifth reviews has been delayed, discussions
between the Government and the IMF are ongoing. The World Bank increased its budgetary
support envelope to Jamaica to US$400 million, with half of these resources disbursed under the
FSDPL1. The GoJ also received US$600 million in budget support from the IADB in 2010, with
the most recent disbursement of US$200 million coming on December 17, 2010, via a Policy-
Based Loan (PBL). The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) disbursed US$33.3 million in
February 2009 and US$33.3 million in April 2010, representing the first two tranches of a
US$100 million PBL approved in December 2008. The broad support by the donor community
has helped boost confidence in Jamaica in the international markets and has given the GoJ
important breathing room to continue the implementation of its ambitious reform program.

5.      The IFI’s continue to coordinate closely on their support to the reform program of
the GoJ. The reform actions supported by this DPL are complemented by the IMF SBA and the
public sector reform programs of the IADB. There is full alignment between the Program Matrix
of this DPL and the PBL of the CDB. There is a division of labor among the institutions to
ensure complementarity. As part of this coordination, the World Bank, the IMF and the IADB
had joint missions for reforming debt management in May and October 2010. The World Bank is
also coordinating with the IFIs in the phasing of disbursements and in the sequencing of the
policy actions. This coordination is important to ensure that the Government’s financial needs
are met in a timely manner while reform momentum is maintained.

6.     The proposed FSDPL2 is rooted in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of the
World Bank Group. Fiscal and debt sustainability—the focus of the proposed FSDPL2—are
the main components of the macroeconomic stability pillar in the 2010-13 CPS (Report No.
52849), which was presented to the Board on March 23, 2010. The proposed FSDPL2 is
envisaged in the CPS as the second of the two programmatic single tranche operations designed
to support the GoJ reform efforts in this area.

                               II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Political Context
7.      Jamaica has been a stable parliamentary democracy since its independence in 1962,
with freedom of expression and well-established traditions of democratic participation.
Politics have historically been dominated by two main parties—the People’s National Party
(PNP) and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). The current Government was elected in late 2007 on
a manifesto to improve fiscal and debt situation, curb corruption, create jobs, and reduce crime
and violence through strengthening the governance framework. The GoJ embarked on an
ambitious reform program and introduced a number of measures aimed at reducing debt and
controlling the debt generating process which should provide the necessary fiscal space to
advance the country’s overall development objectives. The next elections are constitutionally due
in 2012 although in practice they could be called earlier.

B. Economic Context
8.      Jamaica is a small open economy with good social indicators but major challenges
from low growth, natural disaster vulnerability, and high debt. Jamaica is the largest
English-speaking country in the Caribbean with a population of 2.7 million and per capita
income of US$4,972 in 2010. Life expectancy is high at 73 years and poverty reached a low of
9.9 percent of population in 2007. However, poverty spiked to an estimated 17.6 percent of
population in 2010 (a third consecutive year of increases) due to the severe economic contraction
following the global crisis. Despite a number of advantages—including rich natural resource
endowments, close proximity to the United States (its largest trading partner), and high levels of
private investment—the country faces major challenges from low growth, vulnerability to natural
disasters, and high debt.

9.      Low growth despite high rates of investment has been a major challenge for
Jamaica. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita grew just 0.5 percent per year since the
1970s, despite total fixed investment averaging 25 percent of GDP during 1960-2008, above the
average for Latin America (20 percent) and comparable to fast-growing East Asia (28 percent).
Several studies attempted to explain this puzzling combination of high investment and low
growth by: (i) potential errors in measuring GDP growth; (ii) high replacement investment due to
chronic natural disasters; (iii) distorted capital accumulation due to high crime; (iv) insufficient
public investment due to debt overhang; and (v) large investment in construction, a large part of
which could be unproductive. None of these factors explain the puzzle, and a new World Bank
Country Economic Memorandum has instead focused on low productivity due to crime, human
capital deficiencies, and fiscal distortions (Box 1).

       Box 1: Low Growth in Jamaica: Disappointing Performance due to Low Productivity
The findings of a new World Bank Country Economic Memorandum for Jamaica (Report No.
60374-JM) indicate that the disappointing economic performance is a case of low productivity. Total
Factor Productivity (TFP) in Jamaica was growing above the world and regional averages in the 1960s but
collapsed in the 1970s. Estimates for 1992-2008 show that labor productivity was negative in eight of 10
sectors of activity in Jamaica and it was positive but negligible in manufacturing and transport and
communication. Jamaica’s TFP per worker also lags significantly behind most other countries in the Latin
American and the Caribbean region. Low TFP is also a major factor explaining the income gap between
Jamaica and the US. Analysis shows that between 40 and 60 percent of the income disparity between the
two countries is due to differences in TFP.
Main causes of Jamaica’s low productivity are: (i) high crime rates; (ii) deficiencies in human
capital; and (iii) fiscal distortions.
    Crime is the most evident and severe problem in Jamaica. Crime severely limits growth, leading to a
vicious circle as low growth further increases crime and higher crime rates further reduce growth. Crime
erodes political stability and makes rule of law a critical area of concern. It has a negative effect on human
capital, creating incentives for migration. It constrains business expansion and diverts resources from
productive activities to crime protection. Because of crime and other structural conditions, investment in
Jamaica tends to flow into isolated activities. All-inclusive resorts, mining, and Export Free Zones are the
best examples of this “enclave? development model with its low spillovers. A 2007 United Nations–World
Bank study (Report No. 37820) illustrates the link between growth and lower crime rates. It states that
Jamaica could experience an annual increase of 5.4 percent in per capita GDP if it cut crime rates to the
levels prevailing in Costa Rica.
    The available evidence shows that Jamaica has a low level of human capital, with poor quality of
education and insufficient training of its labor force, despite the country’s efforts. From 1995 to 2008,
Jamaica saw an increase in enrollment rates in both secondary and tertiary level education, however
existing quality indicators put Jamaica below the Caribbean region average. There is also evidence that
human capital is a scarce factor because private returns to schooling and private returns to training are
extremely high, and have not declined in recent years. Jamaica also has challenges in retaining its qualified
workers because of the brain drain process. The migration rate of qualified workers has increased. In
general, it is believed that the people who migrate are more able, more entrepreneurial and less risk averse.
The country therefore loses very important assets for productivity, innovation and entrepreneurship via
migration. The Jamaican labor market is flexible but substantial deficiencies exist in the skill content of
the labor force. Skill formation through schooling, job training, and learning-by-doing is critical to labor
productivity and economic growth. A large portion of the Jamaican labor force has no formal training. In
1995, as much as 80 percent of the labor force indicated that they had no formal training. In 2008, the
figure remained high at 72 percent. The combination of low educational attainment and low levels of


                                                     4
training suggests an overall low quality of the human capital.
    Jamaica’s fiscal policies and budget-management practices and policies constrain fiscal consolidation.
Inconsistent, complex tax policy with numerous exemptions and special privileges has reduced tax
revenue by an estimated 20 percent, significantly affecting the GoJ’s spending capacity. The complex
system of taxes and incentives also creates distortions for the allocation of capital and lowers investment
productivity. High debt-servicing costs and a high wage bill have reduced the fiscal space available for
productivity enhancing public spending, including public investment which is complementary to private
investment and expenditure on education and health. Underlying institutional and political economy
factors are major impediments to strengthening fiscal and expenditure policy and management of public
finances. Existing rules and organizational structures have not supported the required fiscal discipline.
From a political economy perspective, the relatively sharp division of the country into opposing political
camps has made it difficult to reach a national consensus and make binding commitments.


10.     Vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change has been a second major
challenge. The coastal zone in Jamaica is home to two-thirds of the population and an estimated
75 percent of industries, critical infrastructure and service sector, which altogether account for
80-90 percent of GDP. These assets and the production capacity are frequently threatened by
natural disasters and climate change, with most of the damage concentrated on critical
infrastructure such as roads. The 2007 Hurricane Dean left J$23.8 billion in damages while the
2008 Hurricane Gustav caused losses of J$15.2 billion. The Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ)
estimates the damage from the September 2010 Tropical Storm Nicole at J$20.5 billion.

11.    High debt is another important constraint in Jamaica, which has been among the
most indebted countries in the world for more than two decades. The public sector debt-to-
GDP ratio has averaged over 100 percent from FY1990/91 to FY2007/08. Debt declined to 80
percent of GDP in FY1996/97 through a concerted effort of sustained fiscal surpluses exceeding
10 percent of GDP. However, it rose thereafter due to the 1996 financial crisis and the GoJ’s
subsequent decision to bail out all depositors at an estimated cost of 40 percent of GDP. After
peaking at 125 percent of GDP in FY2002/03, the Government debt (excluding PetroCaribe and
domestic guaranteed debt) started to decline and reached 109 percent of GDP by FY2007/08.
Since then, the adverse impact of the global crisis—in particular the rise in domestic interest
expenditures, sharp currency depreciation in FY2008/09, and the severe GDP contraction—
caused the debt to rise to 129 percent of GDP by FY2009/2010. Including all public, publicly
guaranteed, and PetroCaribe debt—the definition of public debt used by the IMF—the debt-to-
GDP ratio reached 140 percent (Figure 1).

12.     The history of high debt is related to a high public sector wage bill, weak budget
control leading to chronic deficits, and contingent liabilities arising from a large number of
weakly regulated public bodies. The Government is among the largest employers in Jamaica,
with its nearly 120,000 workers accounting for more than 10 percent of total employment. Since
the mid-1990s, the public sector wage bill has fluctuated between 10 and 12.5 percent of GDP
and the wage negotiation process has been fragmented with large number of bargaining units
leading to staggered wage negotiations and salary increases. Although the central government
has been able to record large primary surpluses despite the fiscal pressure from the wage bill,
these surpluses have been insufficient for a sustainable fiscal consolidation. For instance, in
FY2007/08 the primary surplus amounted to 7.8 percent of GDP, but the overall central
government balance was an almost 4 percent deficit due to high interest expenditures. The public


                                                     5
bodies balance widened the deficit by another 3.4 percent of GDP and off budget expenditures
were 1.1 percent of GDP. Consequently, the 7.8 percent of GDP primary surplus gave way to an
aggregate public sector deficit of 8.2 percent of GDP. The Government has also had to take on
the liabilities created by the public bodies.

13.     In order to improve the debt profile and increase debt sustainability, the GoJ
launched the Jamaica Debt Exchange (JDX) on January 14, 2010. The JDX had three
primary objectives: (i) improve the maturity profile of domestic debt, of which 40 percent was
due to mature in less than 24 months; (ii) reduce the interest expenses, which at end-2009
represented 15.9 percent of GDP and accounted for an average of 60 percent of GoJ’s revenues
annually; and (iii) reduce the variable-rate portion of domestic debt. The JDX, which closed on
February 24, 2010, was a voluntary exchange covering all domestically issued bonds (excluding
Treasury Bills) and involved the consolidation of 345 securities into 25 new benchmark bonds
with longer maturity and lower coupons. The total value of the offer was J$700.0 billion or 65.0
percent of GDP. The offer was executed as a par-for-par exchange of principal amounts and non-
participating securities were called. The exchange was broadly endorsed by the multilateral
agencies, including the IMF, IADB, the CDB, and the World Bank, who together committed
US$2.4 billion to the Government’s reform program.

14.     The JDX recorded a participation rate of 99.2 percent and resulted in notable
improvements in the maturity profile and composition of the domestic debt as well as
decline in coupon rates. The average maturity of the domestic debt after the JDX increased to
8.9 years from 4.5 years, lowering pressures on interest rates and improving the Government’s
ability to respond to shocks (Figure 2). In particular, the portion of domestic debt due in
FY2010/11 fell from 26 percent to 10 percent. The share of domestic bonds attributable to fixed
rate instruments increased to 38 percent from 34 percent, while the newly introduced CPI-linked
bonds accounted for 3 percent. The share of domestic debt priced in US dollars fell to 11 percent
from 12 percent. The JDX was also successful in lowering the variable rate portion of the
domestic debt by 6.0 percentage points to 48 percent. The average coupon on outstanding


                                                                            6
Jamaican and US dollar domestic debts came down to 12.5 percent and 7 percent, respectively.
This reflected a decline of 650 basis points (bps) and 200 bps respectively. At the time of the
operation, the JDX was estimated to have reduced the net present value of the debt by about 20
percent due to fall in interest rates and extension of maturities.

C. Recent Economic Developments
15.     The success of the JDX generated significant improvements in the macroeconomic
environment through substantial interest savings, reversal of currency depreciation, and a
reduction in risk premia. The JDX is estimated to have generated annualized interest savings of
5 percent of GDP in FY2010/11, representing a decline of 34 percent in first year of
implementation (Figure 3). The exchange rate appreciated by 5.5 percent between January 2011
and March 2010, reflecting increased investor preference for Jamaica dollar securities. This was
the sharpest appreciation since 1997 and compares favorably with annual average depreciation of
8.6 percent in the previous 10 years. Moreover, Jamaica sovereign spreads fell to 113 basis
points after the JDX from 377 basis points in the five months before (Figure 3). Moody’s, Fitch,
and Standard & Poor upgraded their ratings on Jamaican sovereign foreign currency bonds from
Caa1, CCC, and SD in the months before and during the JDX to B3, B- and B- with a stable
outlook. These developments contributed to the interest rates on Treasury Bills having fallen to
the lowest levels in thirty years.

16.     The balance sheets of financial institutions have remained robust after the JDX
despite substantial holdings of Government debt. There have been no requests for support
from the Financial System Support Fund (FSSF) which was created to provide temporary
assistance to institutions in the event of liquidity and capital needs resulting from the JDX. As of
March 2011, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) – a solvency indicator – of the banking system
stood at 17.6 percent, just above the 17.4 average of the past two years. Nonetheless, both the
JDX and the slow recovery in the domestic economy had some impact on the financial system.
Following average annual growth of 22 percent since 2007, credit to private sector contracted by
2.3 percent in March 2011. In addition, the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans rose to
7.5 percent from 5.5 percent in March 2010.

17.     Despite remaining weaknesses, the Jamaican economy appears to be recovering
from the adverse effects of the global crisis. Real GDP contracted by 2.5 percent in
FY2009/10, which was 1.1 percentage points better than expected. In the last quarter of
FY2010/11, real GDP expanded by 1.4 percent (year-on-year), limiting the contraction for the
entire year to 0.6 percent. Although the recovery has been slowed by the tentative pace of
rebound in the global economy and the adverse effects of Tropical Storm Nicole in September
2010, growth is forecasted to continue improving. Despite an end of the year spike in oil prices,
the current account deficit widened marginally from 7.6 to 7.9 percent of GDP, owing mostly to
increased tourist arrivals, higher remittances, and a slowdown in profit transfers.1 Annual
inflation has slowed to 7.8 percent from 13.3 percent a year ago, prompting the Bank of Jamaica
(BoJ) to reduce its benchmark interest rates.2 The public sector deficit has improved to 6.7
percent of GDP from 12.5 percent in FY2009/10 despite an increase in capital spending due to a
containment of interest expenditures as well as improvements in public entities balance.
Domestic financing was largely secured through the reopening of existing bonds.

18.     The reserve coverage has been protected with funding from the IMF given declining
private capital inflows. With the help of IMF disbursements and demand for local currency, net
international reserves (NIR) increased to US$2.5 billion at the end of FY2010/11. Gross reserves
amount to more than 22 weeks of imports goods and services, or more than three times the value
of the current account deficit. Gross reserves to short-term external debt increased from 6.4 in
FY2008/09 to 11.2 in FY2009/10. However, this ratio declined to 5.4 in FY2010/11 due to
additional borrowing by the Government in the course of the year.

  Remittances grew by 6.0 percent in the first quarter of 2011 (year on year) to US$480 million, the highest quarterly
outturn since 2008. Total number of visitors increased by 8.1 percent (year on year) in the first two months of 2011.
2
  Effective July 4, the interest rate on the 30-day Certificates of Deposit was 6.5 percent, down from 10 percent in
March 2010. The BoJ also reduced the interest rate payable to financial institutions for overnight placements from
0.50 percent to 0.25 percent.

19.     The GoJ has agreed to settle the outstanding wage claims by public sector unions at
the total cost of approximately two percent of GDP over the medium term. In 2008, the GoJ
and the unions signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which provided for a 15 percent
public sector salary increase in 2008 and a follow-up increase of 7 percent in 2009. However, the
GoJ was unable to pay the 2009 increase due to a difficult fiscal situation (that resulted mostly
from the impact of the global financial crisis) and instead instituted a three-year public sector
wage freeze. On August 3, 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that the MoU was a binding contract
that the GoJ must honor, but did not specify the method or timing of making the payment.
Following the decision, the GoJ and the public sector unions reached an agreement on July 7,
2011. This agreement fulfills the legal obligation of the GoJ by raising the public sector payroll
by the agreed-upon amount of seven percent in September 2011 and making back payments
totaling J$22.4 billion (1.8 percent of last year’s GDP) in equal installments over the next three
years.3 In order to finance the additional wage expenditure, the GoJ is preparing a supplementary
budget outlining the necessary expenditure cuts and/or revenue measures. This supplementary
budget is expected to be presented to Parliament on August 31, 2011.

20.      The GoJ is committed to maintaining social expenditures for protecting vulnerable
groups. Under the challenging environment created by the severe adverse effects of the crisis
and the fiscal tightening, the GoJ has protected and even widened the coverage of safety net
programs. In FY2010/11, the number of beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer Programme
for Advancement through Health and Education (PATH) grew by nearly 39,000 recipients (a 9
percent increase), while the program budget grew by 28 percent. Maintaining social expenditures
is also recognized under the IMF-supported SBA.

D. Economic Outlook and Debt Sustainability
21.      The economy is expected to recover gradually over the medium term. Continued
weaknesses in the global environment, combined with the security events in May 2010 and the
damage from Tropical Storm Nicole, have limited the recovery potential in the near term.
Although the economy returned to positive growth in FY2011/12, given the severe impact of the
crisis, the real GDP is only expected to recover to its FY2007/08 level sometime in FY2013/14.
As the global environment improves and export revenues strengthen, the current account deficit
is expected to narrow in the medium term, reaching 5.8 percent of GDP by FY2013/14 (Table 1).
Inflation is expected to continue declining to 5.5 percent by FY2013/14, although significant
upside risks exist due to recent food price hikes.

22.     The improvement in fiscal space created by the JDX is expected to be consolidated
through strong primary surpluses, low interest expenditures, and stronger control over
public bodies balances. After declining to 4.4 percent of GDP in FY2010/11 due to lower-than-
expected revenues, the central government primary surplus is projected to rise to 5.1 percent of
GDP by FY2013/14.4 Domestic interest savings due to the JDX along with lower external
interest rates are expected to gradually improve the overall deficit from 6.2 percent of GDP in

 At the current exchange rate, each payment would amount to approximately US$49 million.

 Additional wage expenditure due to the recent salary increase is expected to be financed by further revenue
measures or containment of other expenditures, leaving the primary balance targets unaffected.


                                                     9
FY2010/11 to 2.8 percent in FY2013/14. The net transfers to public bodies are expected to be
eliminated by FY2013/14 due to divestiture of large loss-making entities such as Air Jamaica. To
support the achievement of fiscal targets, capital expenditure will have to remain prudent at
around 4 percent of GDP. However, as the GoJ focuses on increasing the efficiency of capital
spending, growth is not expected to suffer.5

23.    Due to these efforts, the public, publicly guaranteed, and PetroCaribe debt is
expected to fall from 140 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 to under 126 percent by FY2013/14.
Under the baseline scenario of the debt sustainability analysis, which assumes full
implementation of the Government reform program, the debt to GDP ratio is projected to fall
gradually (Figure 4; also see Annex 7). Lower interest payments following the JDX and
economic recovery contribute to the downward debt dynamics. Still, the debt ratio remains
vulnerable to external shocks, particularly large exchange rate depreciations. For example,
because more than 40 percent of Government debt is denominated in foreign currency, a 30
percent nominal exchange rate depreciation in FY2011/12 could raise the debt to GDP ratio by
17 percentage points.

24.     The debt situation would have been dire had the JDX not been successful. Scenario
A1 in Figure 5 simulates this case assuming low GDP growth (averaging 0.9 percent per year),
high real external and domestic real interest rates (5.4 and 8.4 percent, respectively), and a low
primary surplus for the entire projection period. Figure 5 shows that the public debt to GDP ratio
would have been on an explosive path under this scenario. In the absence of the JDX, the debt
ratio could have been improved somewhat if some fiscal consolidation (improving the primary
surplus by one percent of GDP) had taken place (Scenario A2). These results highlight the
importance of the JDX and the fiscal consolidation program in lowering public debt.

  The increased efficiency of government capital spending will be supported, inter alia, by the introduction of the
investment prioritization methodology in the public sector. See the next section of this Program Document for
additional details on the investment prioritization tool.

25.    Although the debt exchange has considerably lowered refinancing risks, these
remain substantial over the medium term. After having declined dramatically from 26.1 to
14.6 percent of GDP from FY2009/10 to FY2010/11, gross financing needs are expected to
remain around this level through FY2013/14 (Table 2). Still, debt service obligations will remain
substantially below pre-JDX levels. Official flows—which comprise the bulk of external
financing—are expected to diminish over time, while domestic financing sources will become
more important. Balance of payments support under the IMF SBA, scheduled to expire in May
2012, could total an additional SDR279 million if the entire quota amount is disbursed.

26.    Overall, the macroeconomic policy framework is assessed as being adequate for the
proposed operation. Progress continues with the fiscal reform, in spite of the fragile recovery
from the adverse effects of the global crisis. Monetary policy has remained prudent and inflation
expectations have come down. External balances remain stable while tourism and remittances


                                                        11
have recovered well. The international reserve coverage is strong and the Jamaican authorities
remain in close dialogue with the IMF on meeting performance targets under the SBA. At the
same time, important challenges remain. Downside risks to the global economic recovery could
threaten revenues from tourism and remittances. Similarly, credit markets and the reserve
coverage could be adversely affected should international financial conditions deteriorate. The
delay in the IMF reviews could affect the progress towards medium-term fiscal targets, although
under the current projections Jamaica could still reach its goals of a balanced budget and a debt-
to-GDP ratio (excluding PetroCaribe and domestic guaranteed debt) of close to 100 percent of
GDP by FY2015/16. While the current improvements in the macroeconomic environment and
economic management due to strong commitment of the GoJ to reforms have opened a major
window of opportunity, a sustained period of implementation is required for achieving lasting
results. The fiscal and debt sustainability reforms are not yet complete and further efforts are
needed to permanently reduce the debt-GDP ratio. In particular, efforts to reduce public
indebtedness must be based on a three-pronged approach of controlling public sector balances,
improving public financial management, and reducing tax distortions and enhancing
competitiveness to improve economic growth potential. The Government’s program to
accomplish these objectives is outlined in the following section.



            III. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM: IMPROVING FISCAL
                SUSTAINABILITY AND GROWTH POTENTIAL
27.      Two interrelated and critical development challenges for the GoJ are: (i) achieving
fiscal and debt sustainability; and (ii) laying the foundation for inclusive and sustained
growth over the medium term. To this end, the Government has articulated an ambitious long-
term strategy, Vision 2030, and an associated Medium-Term Socioeconomic Policy Framework
(MTF, FY09-12) with intermediate steps that will support the longer term vision. Although the
economic environment is fundamentally different from when the process began four years ago,
the broad thrusts of the articulated strategy remain valid. Vision 2030 aims at shifting the
economy from one based exclusively on exploiting “basic factors? – sun and sand tourism,
mineral deposits and basic agricultural commodities – to one that is increasingly based on
cultural, human, knowledge and institutional capital to take the country to OECD standards of
living. The medium-term strategy identifies six national outcomes and five supporting national
outcomes. There is full alignment of the MTF with Vision 2030 Jamaica and the six Priority
National Outcomes for MTF 2009-2012 are: (i) security and safety; (ii) a stable macroeconomy;
(iii) strong economic infrastructure; (iv) energy security and efficiency; (v) world class education
and training; and (vi) effective governance.

28.     The combination of high debt and low economic growth created a vicious circle in
the past, increasing the challenges for fiscal sustainability. On one side, high debt burden
limited fiscal resources for productive public spending and increased uncertainty in the economy,
adversely affecting the Jamaican economic growth. On the other hand, low growth rates reduced
government revenues and created a necessity for higher fiscal adjustment, making an already big
challenge potentially more difficult to tackle. The GoJ is fully aware of the importance of
breaking free from the vicious circle of the past and creating an economic environment
conducive to growth.


                                                12
29.     The GoJ is in the process of defining a comprehensive medium term growth agenda.
The challenge of achieving sustained high growth is big given the poor historical performance.
Following the successful implementation of the fiscal responsibility reforms and the debt
exchange in 2010, macroeconomic environment and fiscal sustainability improved significantly,
allowing the Government to focus more on medium term growth. In this regard, the Cabinet
approved an interim framework for a Growth Inducement Strategy in February 2011. The
strategy, developed at the PIOJ and closely aligned with the goals of Vision 2030 Jamaica
National Development Plan, elaborates a set of short- and medium-term measures to jump-start
growth over the next three fiscal years. The focal points of the new strategy include job creation,
income generation, and increased production and exports through six key components of crime
reduction, asset mobilization, competitiveness (including tax reform), business networks,
infrastructure, and urban/regional development. The strategy is based on the principles of public-
private partnerships, drawing on the lessons learned from the pilot Community Renewal
Programme, and plans to use targeted public spending on national works and community
development projects to create an enabling environment for private sector participation and
growth through direct multiplier effects, provision of public goods (e.g. productivity spillovers
from improved infrastructure), and reduction of obstacles to doing business (e.g. crime).

30.     The World Bank is supporting the GoJ growth agenda through both existing
projects and projects in the pipeline. The Bank is financing three ongoing investment projects
that help support growth in Jamaica. These are the Jamaica Inner City Basic Services for the
Poor project (P091299), the Jamaica Rural Economic Development Initiative (P105122), and the
Jamaica Education Transformation Capacity project (P107407). In addition, the recently
approved Jamaica Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement project (P112780) has the
objective of increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy cost, thereby improving
competitiveness of the country. On the analytical side, the new CEM is specifically focused on
growth obstacles in Jamaica (See Box 1). The CEM was delivered to the Government in mid-
June 2011 and was launched with a series of dissemination workshops in Kingston, Montego
Bay, and Ocho Rios. The recommendations of the new CEM are expected to facilitate a broader
discussion on growth agenda in the country.

31.     The GoJ has taken a sequenced approach of focusing on the most urgent and
pressing problem of fiscal sustainability first, while laying the foundations for inclusive and
sustained growth. Magnified by the adverse impact of the global crisis, the most pressing
challenge for the GoJ in 2009-10 was improving fiscal and debt sustainability while protecting
the social gains achieved over the past years. Therefore, the Government reform program under
implementation is focused on fiscal and debt sustainability, improving the business environment
through establishment of an efficient and equitable tax system, financial system stability, and
price stability. The achievement of these goals is expected to also address some of the obstacles
that have limited Jamaica’s growth performance in the past.

32.      The reform program under implementation rests on three pillars which also form
the FSDPL program development objectives. Given the above-mentioned challenges faced by
the GoJ, the natural focus of the reform program has been on the fiscal and debt sustainability
pillar, although the Government has made substantial progress in all three areas:




                                                13
   a) Enhancing Fiscal and Debt Sustainability by supporting reforms to increase control on
      public spending and debt generation, reduce debt service burden and improve debt
      management, reduce financial vulnerabilities, and increase public spending effectiveness.
      New reforms include the enactment and implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility
      Framework (FRF), submission to Parliament of a new debt management law and
      improving capacity of the Debt Management Unit (DMU), and divestiture of the largest
      loss-making Public Bodies.
   b) Increasing the Efficiency of Financial Management and Budget Processes by supporting
      efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditure and investment, and strengthen
      control of public finances and the effectiveness of government budgeting practices. New
      reforms include the implementation of a new methodology for evaluating investments,
      introduction of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and transition to
      performance auditing.
   c) Reducing Distortions and Enhancing the Efficiency of the Tax System through reducing
      the use of fiscal incentives and increasing the uniformity of the tax code, improving client
      services for tax payers, broadening the tax base, and simplifying tax payments. New
      reforms include the consolidation of tax agencies into a single Tax Administration
      Jamaica (TAJ), limiting the issuance of new tax waivers and initiating a comprehensive
      review of the incentive structure, amalgamation of payroll taxes, and broadening the
      availability of online services for tax filing and payment.
33.     International experience suggests that countries which successfully resolved debt
challenges and achieved fiscal sustainability focused their reform programs on increasing
primary balances, strengthening fiscal and financial institutions, minimizing currency risks
to the debt stock, and buttressing reserves. The GoJ reform program, described in more detail
below, addresses each of these elements to ensure long-term solvency, increase fiscal space, and
contribute to an environment conducive to growth. The FRF, MTEF, and investment
prioritization are expected to strengthen the institutional structure, public bodies’ rationalization
and tax reforms should improve public sector balances, and DMU reforms are anticipated to
result in a strategic, risk- and cost-minimizing approach to debt management. In addition to
working with the Bank and other donors on these three elements, the GoJ has received support
from the IMF in maintaining relatively high levels of international liquidity. In this regard, the
GoJ reform program has been designed and implemented based on sound analytic principles in
order to maximize the potential of reforms to engender substantive and lasting effects.

34.     The reform program supported by the proposed FSDPL2 is expected to establish a
strong foundation for growth-oriented reforms envisioned by the GoJ in the medium term.
The main—but not the only—focus of the reform program supported by the FSDPL series is
fiscal sustainability, reflecting both the reform priorities of the Government and the most urgent
needs at the time of the DPL series was designed. The policies supported by the current DPL
series can be largely thought of as so-called “numerator? policies, designed to address major
sources of fiscal vulnerability and stabilize the debt dynamics. However, the DPL program also
includes reforms in the area of tax policy and tax administration, designed to improve the
business environment and stimulate growth. In addition, reforms supported under FSDPL1—in
particular, the JDX—have already removed an important impediment to growth by lowering the
high cost of debt servicing which was severely constraining the fiscal space. Finally, with the


                                                 14
completion of major parts of the fiscal and debt reform agenda under the proposed FSDPL2, the
GoJ can turn its focus in the coming fiscal year more squarely towards reforms which could
promote growth more directly.

35.     The GoJ reform program builds upon the measures implemented in the last two
years and also supported under the previous DPL operations. The GoJ reform program is
expected to provide long-term solutions to the problems that have contributed to fiscal slippages
and debt accumulation in the past. New measures taken under the GoJ program solidify the
milestones achieved and include key policy actions required to maintain the reform momentum
and achieve fundamental changes in the public sector. The implementation of the FRF, major
debt reforms, divestiture of large loss-making Public Bodies, and improvements in public
financial management and tax policy and administration build on the momentum of the adoption
of FRF, JDX, the initiation of a public sector reform plan, and strengthening tax revenue and
collection.

A. Indicative Triggers and Progress in Achieving Expected Outcomes of the
   Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL Series

36.      The FSDPL2 is proposed as the second of two single-tranche programmatic DPLs
and builds on the progress achieved since the previous operations.6 The GoJ reform agenda
is part of a well-specified medium-term program, and the policy actions and outcome indicators
of the proposed operation, as well as those of the 2009 Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL and
the 2010 FSDPL1, have been sequenced to match the GoJ’s phased approach to reforms. The
preparation of the FSDPL2 commenced once the GoJ achieved significant progress on the five
indicative triggers agreed upon in the FSDPL1 (Table 3). In the course of the policy dialogue
between the GoJ and the Bank, three of the five triggers were revised and another trigger, once
completed, was split into two separate prior actions (Table 3).

37.     The GoJ has made substantial progress towards achieving end-program outcomes,
and its performance in achieving interim indicators has been mostly satisfactory. An
October 2010 ICR report (ICR00001658) assessed the progress towards meeting the expected
outcomes of the 2009 Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL (Report No. 46806-JM) and found that
performance had been moderately satisfactory. According to the report, GoJ fully met five of the
11 targets, partially met four others, and did not meet the remaining two. A major factor
affecting implementation was the deeper than expected recession, compounded by the
Government’s small majority in Parliament which complicated the passage of some reforms.
With regard to the interim indicators for the DPL series stipulated in the FSDPL1, the GoJ has
fully met seven out of ten and partially met two others (See Annex 3). The only interim indicator
not met was a target for the primary balance, which was missed due to much deeper and more
protracted economic slowdown in the country. Finally, the achievement of the end-series
outcomes appears to be on track, with only one of nine targets in danger of being missed (Annex
3). This target is the wage bill to GDP ratio, which is likely to be missed given the recent public
sector salary increase. However, this target was already off track even before the wage increase
due to slower-than-anticipated recovery of economic activity. Moreover, in providing this
increase the Government was following a Supreme Court ruling and therefore had to respect the
Court decision or risk losing credibility in the eyes of the public sector workers as well as the
broader civil society (see paragraph 19 for additional details). Finally, the GoJ has committed to
identifying revenue measures or expenditure cuts to finance the increase and protect medium-
term fiscal and debt sustainability.

B. Pillar 1: Enhancing Fiscal and Debt Sustainability

Fiscal Responsibility Framework
38.    The GoJ has recognized that controlling public sector balances and bringing the
debt to GDP ratio on a declining path requires fundamental changes in the institutional
structure to actively promote decision making processes consistent with fiscal
sustainability. The historical problems leading to the build-up of the high debt included the
fragmented budget structure focused on central government, while leaving large number of
public bodies out of prudent budgetary controls. This structure allowed for open ended fiscal
commitments and un-quantified contingent liabilities; a fragmented and dysfunctional wage
bargaining mechanism with a tendency to accelerate public sector wage growth during the


                                                 18
budget year; and a separation of the policy making process from the budget process. As a result,
ad hoc intra year adjustments to the budget have become common practice. Overall, within the
budgetary process, a lack of defined responsibilities and clear accountability mechanisms
implied a tendency to push spending above what was fiscally sustainable while at the same time
discrediting the whole budget process as spending units could never be certain that budgeted
funds would be actually available.

39.     The GoJ introduced the Fiscal Responsibility Framework (FRF) to address these
challenges and ensure accountability for applying principles of prudent fiscal management.
The FRF was introduced as amendments to the Financial Administration and Audit Act and
Public Bodies Management and Accountability Act, approved by Parliament in March 2010 and
made effective in October 2010. The FRF requires the Minister of Finance to demonstrate how
specific policy measures are designed to meet prudent levels of fiscal balances and debt,
including official targets of zero fiscal balance, debt to GDP ratio below 100 percent, and a
reduction of the government wage bill to below 9 percent of GDP by 2016.7 It also requires
increased transparency and comprehensiveness of reporting on fiscal operations, including the
requirement to publish and have approved by Parliament the budgets and corporate plans of all
public bodies. All future borrowing and guarantees (by the Government and Public Bodies)
require the written approval of the Minister of Finance.

40.     The GoJ has begun implementing the FRF this year with the tabling in Parliament
of a Fiscal Policy Paper (FPP), the Auditor General’s report on the FPP, and the Tax
Expenditure Statement. Following the FRF requirements, the FPP presented by the Minister on
April 28, 2011, included the following key elements: (i) a Fiscal Responsibility Statement signed
by the Minister, which contains medium-term fiscal and debt targets together with a menu of
revenue and expenditure measures required to achieve them; (ii) a Macroeconomic Framework,
outlining macroeconomic developments in FY2009/10-FY2010/11 and the outlook for
FY2011/12-FY2013/14; (iii) a Fiscal Management Strategy, containing an overview of central
government and public bodies operations together with medium-term revenue and expenditure
strategies and the expected public debt trajectory. The Auditor General, mandated by the FRF to
examine the FPP for compliance with prudent fiscal management, has issued its report to
Parliament on May 27, 2011. The report finds that the FPP complies with the FRF principles but
also provides recommendations for improving reporting and developing additional performance
targets. The Tax Expenditure Statement, tabled at the same time as the FPP, contains details of
tax exemptions, deductions, and credits granted in the previous calendar year, therefore speaking
to foregone tax revenue.

41.     A second series of amendments to strengthen the FRF has been approved by the
House of Representatives. These amendments, passed on June 7, 2011, tighten up areas of the
fiscal framework by requiring the Ministry of Finance to give approval for any policy change
with budgetary implications before it is presented to Cabinet, limiting guarantees to those which
have been, inter alia, approved by Parliament, eliminating any possible loophole to obtain

  These are provided in section 48C of the Financial Administration and Audit Act. The definition of public debt
includes central government, Bank of Jamaica, and external guaranteed debt. It does not include PetroCaribe or
domestic guaranteed debt.


                                                        19
deferred financing, ensuring that Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are based on sound fiscal
principals and all fiscal risks are reported, and establishing clear reporting and auditing
guidelines for the public bodies. The amendments also provide the legislative framework for
FRF regulations which are currently being finalized.

42.      The FRF is a major step forward in putting the country back onto a sustainable
fiscal and debt path by institutionalizing the process of making good policy choices and
ensuring that fiscal policy is transparent and contestable. It deals with some of the
institutional problems of the past which have led to the loss of control over fiscal deficits and
debt, by increasing the political costs of pursuing unsustainable policies. However, the legal
changes are not a panacea. The credibility and strength of the framework will depend
fundamentally on a consensus among the public and within Parliament that the principles of the
FRF are necessary (although not sufficient) conditions for growth and development. For these
reasons the public sector sensitization program which was launched in early-September to
educate officials (including the Ministers) about the FRF, is fundamental but will also need to be
supplemented by extensive communication with the public and parliament to build the consensus
around the central importance of the FRF for future macroeconomic stability.

43.     The FSDPL2 prior action in the area of fiscal responsibility was an indicative
trigger for this operation envisaged under the FSDPL1. The Government has fully completed
all parts of the following action:

(1)    (a) The Borrower has introduced a fiscal responsibility framework into its legislation, as
       evidenced by the enactment, by the Borrower’s Parliament of: (i) the FAA (Amendment)
       Act which amends the FAA Act to, inter alia, ensure accountability for applying
       principles of prudent fiscal management; and (ii) the PBMA (Amendment) Act which
       amends the PBMA Act to, inter alia, increase the transparency and comprehensiveness of
       data on fiscal operations presented to the Borrower’s Parliament; and

       (b) The Borrower has started to implement the fiscal responsibility framework described
       in the FAA (Amendment) Act, as evidenced by a letter issued by the Borrower’s
       Financial Secretary dated July 18, 2011 demonstrating how said fiscal responsibility
       framework has been implemented, through, inter alia: (i) the submission by the
       Borrower’s Minister of Finance to the Borrower’s Parliament on April 28, 2011 of the
       Fiscal Policy Paper; (ii) the submission by the Borrower’s Auditor General to the
       Borrower’s Parliament on May 27, 2011 of a report indicating that the Fiscal Policy
       Paper complies with the principles of prudent fiscal management specified in Section
       48D of the FAA (Amendment) Act; and (iii) the submission by the Borrower’s Minister
       of Finance to the Borrower’s Parliament in April 2011of estimates of revenue and
       expenditure for Public Bodies with respect to the ensuing financial year as specified in
       Section 2A of the PBMA (Amendment) Act.

44.   The expected outcome from the FSDPL2 (FY2011/12) in this area is the end-series
outcome envisioned in the FSDPL1:

      The FY2011/12 budget process is developed within the FRF and is bound by the FRF’s
       medium term targets for debt creation and the overall fiscal deficit.


                                               20
Debt Management
45.     Jamaica’s current medium-term debt management strategy lacks a quantitative
basis, exposing the country to substantial risk given the large debt and high debt servicing
costs. A lack of a quantifiable debt management strategy, based on risk-cost modeling and an
analysis of markets constraints and opportunities, means the current debt management strategy
may well be sub-optimal. However, there has been no analytical unit responsible for producing
such a strategy within the Debt Management Unit (DMU). Jamaica has also lacked an adequate
legal and regulatory framework for strategic debt management and there has been no high-level
oversight/decision-making body to analyze different strategic proposals for managing the debt
and contingent liabilities, including guarantees, as well as for developing the domestic debt
market. The internal and external auditors lack sufficient knowledge of strategy-oriented public
debt management, and currently do not carry out performance auditing. Although reporting is
relatively good, it lacks more strategic dimensions, risk indicators and analysis of compliance,
along with proposals of new strategies. Finally, there is no structured framework for addressing
operational risk, no procedures manuals, and no Fiscal Agent Agreement with the BoJ.

46.     The GoJ is well aware of these challenges and has submitted to Parliament a new
Public Debt Management law to address the existing deficiencies. The new law consolidates
previously fragmented legislative structure (replacing 19 separate acts) and sets explicit limits for
government borrowing and the issuance of guarantees. The law mandates regular comprehensive
reporting on public sector debt to Parliament as well as the development and implementation of a
Medium Term Debt Management Strategy. Finally, the law provides for the creation of a high-
level Public Debt Management Committee and a technical Public Debt Financing Committee.
The committees will facilitate transparency in debt management, improve institutional memory,
and monitor strategy implementation; the terms of reference for their members have already been
developed. The law has benefitted from feedback from major stakeholders, including the
Accountant General, the Auditor General, and the BoJ, as well as the IFIs including the IMF and
the World Bank.

47.     As part of its effort to improve debt management, the GoJ has submitted to
Parliament a Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS). With technical assistance
and training from the IMF, the World Bank and the IADB, the DMU capacity has been upgraded
through the adoption of a MTDS analytical toolkit. With the new tool, the DMU staff is in a
position to analyze alternative scenarios, quantify the risk-cost trade-offs, and provide more
thorough reporting to the policymakers. The newly developed MTDS has been submitted to
Parliament as part of the opening budget presentation on April 28, 2011.

48.      The GoJ has submitted to Parliament for ratification a new organizational structure
for the Debt Management Unit to provide it with a more strategic, analytical orientation.
The GoJ debt management reform program is developed within the framework of a three-year
reform plan, supported by the Bank and DFID and designed with the objective of strengthening
institutional capacity for public debt and contingent liabilities management. In this regard, the
GoJ has begun to restructure the DMU along the lines of international best practice into a front
(negotiations), middle (analysis) and back office (registration, payments) offices. New positions
have been advertised and the Government is in the process of short-listing and interviewing.



                                                 21
49.     The FSDPL2 prior action in the area of debt management represents a revision of
an indicative trigger for this operation envisaged under the FSDPL1. Part (a) below has been
revised from enactment of the Public Debt Management Act to its submission to Parliament. The
revision of the trigger is an outcome of consultations between the Bank and the Government,
recognizing that, while the Government does not have full control over Parliamentary processes,
its consultative approach and commitment to reform provide a good environment for the
enactment of the Act following its submission to Parliament. Furthermore, the enactment of the
Act is being closely monitored by other key donors and IFIs. The Bank will continue following
the progress of this Law and will take the final outcome into consideration when discussing
potential future Development Policy Lending with Jamaica. The Government has fully
completed all parts of the following action:

(2)    (a) The Borrower has submitted on July 12, 2011 to the Borrower’s Parliament, for
       approval thereby, a bill entitled the Public Debt Management Act, 2011, for purposes of:
       (i) consolidating the existing legal and regulatory framework related to debt management;
       (ii) introducing modern debt management practices (including the establishment of a high
       level Public Debt Management Committee with the purpose of providing strategic
       guidance on debt management, and chaired by the Borrower’s Financial Secretary); and
       (iii) ensuring prudent management of government guarantees and contingent liabilities, as
       evidenced by a letter issued by the Clerk to the Houses of the Borrower’s Parliament
       dated July 14, 2011; and

       (b) the Borrower has started to implement the time-bound action plan dated December 1,
       2010 for purposes of strengthening the institutional and technical capacity of the
       Borrower’s Debt Management Unit, including: (i) the submission by the Borrower to the
       Borrower’s Parliament on July 19, 2011, for ratification thereby, of the Civil Service
       Establishment (General) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 2011 which will establish a new
       functional organization structure with front, middle and back offices, as evidenced by a
       letter issued by the Clerk to the Houses of the Borrower’s Parliament dated July 20, 2011;
       and (ii) the development of a medium term debt management strategy, as evidenced by
       the submission to the Borrower’s Parliament of said debt management strategy on April
       28, 2011 and publication on MoF’s website (http://www.mof.gov.jm).

50.   The expected outcome from the FSDPL2 (FY2011/12) in this area is the end-series
outcome envisioned in the FSDPL1:

      (a) A detailed borrowing plan is published by the Debt Management Unit, which fully
       operationalizes the Medium Term Debt Management Strategy; and

       (b) Quantitative limits on instruments and lenders are established in line with the overall
       budget ceiling established by the FRF.

Rationalization of Public Bodies
51.    The public sector in Jamaica includes a large number of Public Bodies, defined as
statutory bodies, statutory authorities, or Government companies. At the end of FY2010/11,
there were 195 active Public Bodies in Jamaica. Among these, 105 depend on subventions from


                                                22
the Consolidated Fund for all or part of their revenues, while the remaining 90 are expected to
generate sufficient revenue to fully finance their operating costs (self-financing Public Bodies).
The authority for monitoring the financial performance of self-financing Public Bodies rests with
the Public Enterprise Division (PED) of the Ministry of Finance, while Public Bodies which
depend on support from the Consolidated Fund are being monitored by the expenditure division
within the Ministry of Finance.

52.     The GoJ has made substantial progress in increasing financial oversight of the
Public Bodies as their operations have a significant effect on the overall public sector
balance. In FY 2010/11, 67 self-financing Public Bodies submitted their corporate plans and
budgets to the PED, up from 54 in FY2009/10. These 67 Public Bodies have total assets of 70
percent of GDP, employ 15,783 workers (about 10 percent of the total employment in the public
sector), and generated profits (transfers to the Government) of just under J$23 billion, or 7.7
percent of budgetary revenue in FY2009/10.8 Among these, the PED has identified 20 “selected?
Public Bodies for closer monitoring; these 20 account for 60-70 percent of the total expenditure
by self financing Public Bodies. Certain individual Public Bodies within this group have
experienced substantial losses, including a J$11.8 billion loss by Air Jamaica (now privatized),
J$1.8 billion loss by Urban Development Corporation (UDC), and J$1.3 billion loss by
PetroJam. Overall, in FY2009/10 the Public Bodies had a negative contribution to the public
sector balance of 1.6 percent of GDP, increasing the overall public sector deficit from 10.9 to
12.5 percent of GDP.

53.     Recognizing the vulnerabilities to fiscal sustainability and driven by a vision of a
more streamlined, efficient public sector, the GoJ has embarked on a program of
rationalization and restructuring of Public Bodies. The Public Bodies Rationalization Plan
was originally developed in the PED during FY2008/09 with a view to wind-up, merge, and
privatize some 130 Public Bodies. However, the rationalization program at the PED was later
subsumed by the activities of the Public Sector Transformation Unit (PSTU), which is tasked
with a broader strategic objective of reforming the public sector. The Public Sector Master
Rationalization Plan (MRP), prepared by the PSTU, was tabled in Parliament on July 20, 2010.
Following a series of consultations in June 2010 with the major stakeholders, the finalized plan,
which, inter alia, includes a dramatic reduction in public bodies, was tabled in Parliament on
July 20, 2010. The Public Administration and Appropriations Committee (PAAC) of Parliament
agreed with 10 of 14 PSTU recommendations and the final plan will be debated and amended by
Parliament in the beginning of the calendar year, after which it would be submitted for Cabinet
approval.

54.     The GoJ has divested Air Jamaica to Caribbean Airlines while acquiring a small
ownership interest in the latter. Effective May 1, 2010, Caribbean Airlines assumed full
financial responsibility for Air Jamaica. In order to guarantee airlift on routes previously serviced
by Air Jamaica, the GoJ acquired a 16 percent (valued at US$28.5 million) ownership stake in
Caribbean Airlines. Given the small size of the acquisition, however, this purchase does not
conflict with the GoJ divestiture objectives. As part of the transition process, all Air Jamaica

 Between FY 2009/10 and 2010/11, the total assets of the 67 self-financing Public Bodies grew by 10 percent in
nominal terms, while employment grew by nearly 4 percent.


                                                       23
employee positions were made redundant on April 30, 2010. Approximately two-thirds of the
employees have been re-hired by Caribbean Airlines. The GoJ remains the owner of all of Air
Jamaica's other assets, including its real estate assets and its industrial assets. Caribbean Airlines
has leased some of these assets from Air Jamaica.

55.     The Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ)—an entity tasked with divestment of
certain assets— has completed the privatization of the sugar industry by divesting the three
remaining state-owned sugar estates and is advancing the broader divestment agenda in
the agriculture sector. As part of its rationalization program, the GoJ identified six publicly-
owned sugar estates for privatization: St. Thomas Sugar Factory at Duckenfield, Long Pond and
Hampden in Trelawny, Monymusk in Clarendon, Frome in Westmoreland, and Bernard Lodge in
St. Catherine. The first three estates were sold to Everglades Farms Limited and Seprod Limited,
in June 2009, and the sale agreement for the remaining three was signed with Complant
International Sugar Co. Ltd on July 30, 2010. The DBJ is also in the process of divesting the GoJ
stake in the Mavis Bank Coffee Factory Limited, the largest Blue Mountain processing facility in
Jamaica, and the Wallenford Coffee Company, and is inviting expressions of interest to purchase
or lease the land at Montpelier Citrus Company Limited.

56.    The GoJ has entered into an agreement for the sale of Pegasus Hotels of Jamaica as
part of the broader effort to refocus the portfolio of Urban Development Corporation
(UDC) assets on its core mandate of urban development. After receiving clearance from the
Office of Contractor General and subsequently gaining Cabinet approval, a sale agreement for
Pegasus Hotels of Jamaica Limited (PHJL) was signed with the Preferred Bidder on September
14, 2010.9 Several other UDC properties are also slated for divestment. Four proposals were
received for the purchase of UDC’s 50 percent share in Bloody Bay Hotel Developments Ltd by
September 3, 2010, and an evaluation team is assessing the proposals.

57.     The GoJ is preparing the divestiture of assets under the direction of the Ministry of
Energy and Mining, including Clarendon Alumina Partners (CAP) and Petrojam. The sale
of the Government’s 45 percent stake in CAP to Tzu Hui Hung Fang was halted because the
purchaser missed a December 2010 deadline to proceed with the sale, but another unsolicited
offer came in October 2010. The GoJ is pursuing the offer but thus far the sale—which was a
March 2011 structural benchmark under the IMF SBA program—remains incomplete.
Negotiations for the sale of the additional 2 percent stake in Petrojam to PDVSA of Venezuela—
allowing PDVSA to take ownership of a controlling 51 percent stake—are ongoing as PDVSA is
undertaking its due diligence. The GoJ is also in preliminary stages of divesting West Indies
Alumina Company (Windalco), which comprises two alumina refineries, a shipping port and
bauxite mines, and the Wigton Wind Farm.

58.    The Bank reviewed the GoJ privatization practices through a detailed analysis of
the sale process and concluded that appropriate methods were used in the course of


9
  The transaction remains open because under Jamaica Stock Exchange rules the successful bidder needs to offer the
same share purchase terms and conditions to minority shareholders. Currently the tender-offer proceedings between
the successful bidder and the minority shareholders are ongoing; however, regardless of the outcome of these
proceedings, there are no stipulations in the agreement which could revert the sale of the Government’s shares in
PHJL, nor is there any obligation or intention by the Government to take back its holding in PHJL.


                                                       24
privatizations. This analysis is described in more detail in Annex 8. Privatizations have been
adequately announced and publicized, both foreign and domestic buyers have been generally
encouraged to participate, the sales processes have been open, transparent and competitive and
tender pre-conditions have been appropriate.

59.     The GoJ is preparing a divestment policy paper to solidify the overall framework of
the ongoing divestment program. While important strides have been made and the divestment
program remains a priority to the GoJ, the divestment management process is fragmented and
there is no standardized framework in place. To address these challenges, the policy paper is
being prepared with the overall objective of creating a framework with strict guidelines
governing divestments. In the course of its policy dialogue with the Government, the Bank has
provided comments on the draft policy paper.

60.    While the FSDPL2 prior action in the area of Public Bodies rationalization was not
an indicative trigger for this operation, it was envisaged as a potential FSDPL2 prior action
during the preparation of FSDPL1. The Government has fully completed all parts of the
following action:

(3)     The Borrower has continued to implement the plan dated July 3, 2008 to achieve the
        rationalization of Public Bodies, as evidenced by the divestiture of: (i) Air Jamaica
        (pursuant to the Contribution and Share Issuance Agreement, Personnel Provision
        Agreement and Transition Services Agreement, all signed on April 30, 2010); (ii) three
        sugar estates (Monymusk, Frome, Bernard Lodge) (pursuant to the Agreement for Sale
        and Purchase signed on July 30, 2010); and (iii) the Pegasus Hotels of Jamaica Limited
        (pursuant to the Share Sale and Purchase Agreement signed on September 14, 2010).

61.     The expected outcomes from the FSDPL2 (FY2011/12) in this area are the end-
series outcomes envisioned in the FSDPL1:

       The winding-up of inactive Public Entities has been completed (as of December 2009, 38
        inactive bodies remain to be wound-up);

       Pending divestments of public bodies that were slated for privatization have been
        completed.

Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness of Public Service Compensation and
Incentives
62.     The Government of Jamaica has embarked on an ambitious plan of modernizing
core government operations, rationalizing public sector staff, and devolving authority from
the central government to local entities.10 For example, managers currently do not have full
authority in hiring staff and taking disciplinary actions, and lines of reporting and accountability
are somewhat blurred. The GoJ is attempting to strengthen human resource functions (both
horizontal and vertical) with the development of accountability mechanisms to manage for

10
  Devolution of authority includes giving entities full autonomy for overall management of their operations, human
resources and finances.


                                                       25
results, and has become more resolute in securing and maintaining the necessary data on the
public service to assist managers to make informed decisions on staffing, recruitment as well as
overall management of the service.

63.     The PSTU has developed a Public Sector Master Rationalization Plan (MRP) for
restructuring of ministries, departments and agencies. The Plan has identified 12 entities for
full devolution of authority, conducted over an 18 month period.11 Responsibilities for selected
human resources functions have been transferred from the Offices of the Services Commission
as of October 1, 2010. The Offices of the Services Commission will also take a judgment on
whether the entities have adequate human resource capacity to carry out the new devolved
responsibilities, and whether new business processes will need to be introduced. To be effective,
the plan must be accompanied by a complete review of the legislative framework to determine
whether such a rationalization plan, governance structure and proposed decision-taking authority
is within its confines.12 In this regard, the PSTU has recommended that a Prior Options Review
be conducted before final approval for full autonomy is designated.

64.     New accountability processes are in the process of being established. As part of the
Public Sector Modernization Vision and Strategy Medium Term Action Plan (MTAP) - a five
year agenda for modernizing government – the accountability systems across government are
expected to be strengthened, with specific emphasis on senior executive officers and overall
performance management and evaluation systems.13 The Management Accountability
Framework (MAF) will further determine the mechanics of oversight and accountability of all
twelve devolved authorities.14

65.     The GoJ has completed employment surveys of the entire public sector to create a
regularly updated database. By end-March 2011, employment surveys have been completed
for all self-financing, fully-funded, and partially-funded Public Bodies. These surveys, together
with the ones completed in early 2009 covering the central government, form a centralized
database which will be updated on a quarterly basis and is also expected to be reconciled with
the census and payroll information collected by the PSTU as part of a payroll audit. The
database, which resides in the MoF, is expected to be the first step in establishing a centralized
human resource management information system (HRMIS). The HRMIS could contain
information on: (i) total employment; (ii) total vacancies and summaries of each of those by
positions (such as management, professional staff, occupation, etc.); (iii) average total
remuneration and summary statistics on compensation of remuneration (type of position, average


11
   The entities proposed include: (i) National Land Agency; (ii) Administrator General’s Department; (iii) Auditor
General’s Department; (iv) Office of Utilities Regulation; (v) Office of the Parliament; (vi) Passport Immigration
and Citizenship Agency; (vii) National Environment and Planning Agency; (viii) Scientific Research Council; (ix)
Registrar General’s Department; (x) Real Estate Board; and (xi) King’s House. These entities were selected based
on specific criteria developed by the PSTU.
12
    Such legislation includes the Constitution (1962), The Public Service Regulations (1961), the Public Bodies
Management and Accountability Act (amended 2009) and the Executive Agencies Act (2002).
13
   See Cabinet Office website for more information on the Accountability Framework:

14
   it is suggested, for example, that the Public Accountability Commission of Parliament provide oversight of the
Office of the Auditor General


                                                       26
number of qualified applicants per advertised vacancy, by type of position, etc.). The purpose of
this activity would be so that senior officials (e.g. Cabinet) may take corrective action should
employment or wage trends be determined as potentially unsustainable.

66.    The GoJ is working to contain the wage bill growth while respecting its legal
obligations to the public sector workers unions. The recent agreement between the GoJ and
the public sector unions on a seven percent salary increase—originally agreed to in 2008 and
affirmed by the August 2010 Supreme Court decision—has brought an end to the public sector
wage freeze introduced in April 2009 (see paragraph 19 for additional details on this agreement).
In the meanwhile, the GoJ has taken steps to comprehensively revise the wage bargaining
process. The MoF has prepared a position paper outlining a new wage negotiation strategy which
envisions a dramatic reduction in the number of wage bargaining units (currently numbering
more than a hundred) and is discussing the new strategy with the public sector workers unions.

67.    While the FSDPL2 prior action in the area of public service compensation and
incentives was not an indicative trigger for this operation, it was envisaged as a potential
FSDPL2 prior action during the preparation of FSDPL1. The Government has fully
completed all parts of the following action:

(4)    The Borrower, through MoF, has completed employment surveys (censuses) for all non-
       self financing Public Bodies (fully-funded by the Borrower and partially funded by the
       Borrower), as evidenced by the letter issued by the Borrower’s Financial Secretary dated
       May 2, 2011 including all completed surveys.

68.     The expected outcomes from the FSDPL2 (FY2011/12) in this area are the end-
series outcome envisioned in the FSDPL1:

      A centralized HRM database covering total public employment is fully functional;
      The wage bill as a percentage of GDP is at or below 10 percent (Baseline: 11.8 percent of
       GDP by end- FY2009/2010);
      Transition teams are in place in at least 10 Ministries, Departments and Agencies
       (MDAs) to implement the recommendations of the Public Sector Transformation Unit.

C. Pillar 2: Increasing the Efficiency of Financial Management and Budget
   Processes
Achieving Fiscal Discipline and Strategic Allocation of Resources
69.     The introduction of the FRF was a response to a cumulative failure over the years to
take policy decisions consistent with Government priorities and the resources available.
This has particularly been the case with public investment with the result that investments which
are carried out do not always correspond to government priorities, have not always been subject
to a full cost-benefit analysis, and numerous unfinished investments compete for resources with
potential new investments. The FRF introduces responsibility and accountability into the
decision making process, but cannot on its own ensure that spending is aligned with government
priorities. Including a medium term perspective in policy making and budgeting is essential to


                                               27
gradually aligning both current and capital spending decisions with Government priorities.
Indeed such a perspective is a necessary complement to the FRF since it is only with a medium
term planning and budgetary perspective that a credible Fiscal Policy Paper can be developed
and implemented.

70.    Countries which have successfully introduced a medium term perspective into the
policy and budgeting process have done so only gradually over a number of budget cycles.
Introduction of medium term budgeting is a complicated process and it requires a change in the
mind set of all public institutions to fully internalize the requirements of it and do accurate
costing of proposed budgetary programs. Successful country examples, such as Australia, New
Zealand, UK and Turkey, show that implementation takes multiple budget cycles and continuous
improvement of processes based on initial implementation results. In Jamaica this process has
begun as it has been recognized that the Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework
(MTSEPF) which is issued on a regular basis (the most recent one is for the period 2009-2012)
does not constitute a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF), as it is not developed within
a clear macroeconomic resource framework and is not fully costed, nor crucially, updated
annually and used as the based for budget preparation.

71.      The MoF and the PIOJ have been working with the six largest ministries—
representing 91 percent of central government spending—to gradually develop a Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).15 As part of the FY2011/12 budget process, these
ministries submitted their annual budgets accompanied by somewhat less detailed budgets for the
next two years, indicating the costs of the continuation of existing policies and the potential costs
of new policies, within resources ceilings provided by MoF. A selective approach was adopted in
order not to overstretch administrative resources given the need to implement many other
initiatives as well as the human capacity constraints both in the reporting ministries and in the
Public Expenditure Division (PEX) of the MoF, tasked with evaluating the budgets.

72.     The investment projects in the six largest ministries were also evaluated according
to a new methodology for investment prioritization. During the budget preparation process,
the six ministries were required to indicate whether one or more of a fixed set of the
Government’s development objectives would be satisfied by each project. Using a consistent set
of weights, the projects were subsequently ranked by the PEX in order to identify the highest-
ranking, most-impactful projects. This work, as well as the efforts in preparing medium-term
budgets, was facilitated by a group of consultants financed by the IADB. Therefore, human
capacity constraints will be a key challenge in ensuring the sustainability of the process as well
as its expansion to the entire public sector. Moreover, success will require that the prioritization
is enshrined in public regulations as part of the annual budget process and that clear rules are set
regarding the approval of investment projects at the Cabinet level.

73.     The process of introducing a full MTEF takes many years and the measures taken
by the GoJ in this respect are important initial steps. The MTEF processes will start to have
effect once there are effective procedures in place to ensure that policy trade-offs are evaluated


15
  Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture
and Ministry of National Security.


                                                      28
and incorporated into the medium term resource ceilings, and that links are made between outer
year budgets and future annual budgets. In most countries this is only achieved over a number of
budget cycles through iteration and improvement of the medium term process. It might be
discovered that in many cases there is still insufficient information available on the efficiency
and effectiveness of policies to fully evaluate trade-offs. Nonetheless, even at this stage, analysis
of the costs of existing policies into the future and possible costs of new policies will provide
useful information.

74.      The FSDPL2 prior action in the area of fiscal discipline and strategic allocation of
resources represents a revision of indicative triggers for this operation envisaged under the
FSDPL1. In consultations with the Government and following international experience, the
triggers have been revised from all ministries to six key ministries representing 91 percent of
central government expenditure. The revision of the triggers still provides for the coverage of the
vast majority of the central government while also allowing the Government some flexibility in
first testing the tool with the strongest ministries (in terms of capacity) before rolling it out to the
entire central government. This is consistent with experience and best practice in Bank
operations in other countries. Thus, the prior action completed in the area of fiscal discipline and
strategic allocation of resources include:

(5)    (a) The Borrower has implemented a new methodology for evaluating capital investments
       in six line ministries (MoF, Ministry of Transport and Works, Ministry of Education,
       Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and Ministry of National
       Security), as evidenced by the inclusion in the Budget Call 2011/2012 Financial Year
       (Ref. No. 907/120) dated January 28, 2011 of processes to be followed to prioritize the
       investment program; and

       (b) The Borrower has introduced a medium term expenditure framework in six pilot line
       ministries (MoF, Ministry of Transport and Works, Ministry of Education, Ministry of
       Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and Ministry of National Security), as
       evidenced by: (i) the submission by the Borrower’s Minister of Finance to the Borrower’s
       Parliament on April 28, 2011 of the Fiscal Policy Paper, including a fiscal responsibility
       statement outlining how fiscal targets will be achieved; and (ii) the inclusion in the
       Budget Call 2011/2012 Financial Year (Ref. No. 907/120) dated January 28, 2011 of key
       elements of the decision processes for the medium term expenditure framework including
       budget ceilings and procedures for cabinet decisions on medium term priorities.

75.    The expected outcomes from the FSDPL2 (FY2011/12) represent a revision of the
program outcome envisaged under the FSDPL1 following the revision of the prior actions
above:

      The Government has fully implemented the new methodology for evaluating capital
       investments in six pilot ministries;
      The six pilot Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) have submitted their
       MTEFs.




                                                  29
Improving Public Financial Management
76.     The Government is aware of the limitations of the public financial management
(PFM) system and is pursuing an ambitious reform program for PFM strengthening to
support its overall public sector reform and fiscal consolidation. The key measures in this
area are centered on the implementation of the FRF. In addition, the GoJ is working on
strengthening the technical basis of budgeting and financial management through i) improving
accounting and financial reporting and eventually moving to an accrual system of accounting; ii)
introducing an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS); iii) strengthening
internal control and internal audit systems; and iv) strengthening external audit by providing
more independence and improving the capacity of the office of the Auditor General.

77.    The GoJ is planning to implement the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards issued by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The plan includes
implementation of accrual accounting. However, before implementing full accrual system of
accounting, GoJ needs to consider careful sequencing to ensure that appropriate levels of staffing
resources, knowledge, and information systems are available. In addition, more attention needs
to be given to ensuring that the current cash accounting basis is properly understood and that
accounting practices are sufficiently strong to form a proper basis for the introduction of accrual
accounting. The GoJ also needs to introduce a new classification and chart of accounts to meet
the requirements under the planned computerized accounting system.

78.     The GoJ is establishing a central treasury management system (CTMS) to bring
responsibility for treasury management functions under one agency. The CTMS will
establish a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to improve cash management, to consolidate all
general government cash resources, and close the individual bank accounts of government
entities. The process of account consolidation has already begun and the GoJ plans to begin
running the system on a pilot basis in April 2011, consistent with the revised IMF benchmark.
However, international experience suggests that the full implementation of CTMS requires
considerable work on revising institutional structures and business processes can take between
five and seven years, even with adequate preparation. As part of computerization of the PFM
system for the introduction of the CTMS, the GoJ is in the process of procuring software for
integrating the PFM information system, which is also known as the Enterprise Resource
Management System.

79.    GoJ needs to strengthen the control environment by introducing a risk-based
internal audit function by allocating limited internal audit resources in high risk areas.
Jamaica has about 200 internal auditors with units in all ministries. However, the work done by
the internal auditors is mostly compliance auditing rather than checking the systems and
processes and suggesting changes for improving the control environment. While internal audit
should be the responsibility of each ministry, the function of setting internal audit guidelines and
procedures could be centralized in the Ministry of Finance. The Government also needs to
consider developing the capacity of the internal auditors with targeted professional training in
“risk-based? internal auditing.

80.   Following the recommendations of the PSTU, the GoJ is planning to provide full
independence to the Auditor General (AG). Currently, AG has offices in various ministries



                                                30
which can compromise the independence of the audit function. In this regard, focus has been
placed on the devolution of power to give the AG’s office full control over its day-to-day
activities including human resources and financials. Under the revised structure, the Public
Accounts Committee of the Parliament will have oversight of the AG’s office.

81.     The Auditor General is implementing its action plan for institutional and
professional capacity building. The AG is working to strengthen its capacity to meet the new
requirements of the FRF, including reviewing the Fiscal Policy Paper (FPP). Furthermore, new
Performance Audit Unit, Financial Audit Unit, and Information Technology Units have been
established, and the Auditor General is planning to centralize its external audit function. The AG
office has secured support from the UK’s National Audit Office to assist with training,
mentoring, streamlining of reforms and overall quality development of all audit work.

82.      The public financial management agenda was supported by the previous DPLs and
the proposed FSDPL2 does not have any prior actions in this area. Both the Fiscal and Debt
Sustainability DPL (2009) and the FSDPL1 (2010) supported reform actions to improve
institutional capacity in this area and the Bank will continue monitoring the progress.

D. Pillar 3: Reducing Distortions and Enhancing the Efficiency of the Tax System

83.     The tax regime in Jamaica is complicated, with nine major tax instruments applied
at varying rates, numerous exemptions, waivers, and incentives, and high costs of paying
taxes. The main tax instruments in Jamaica include the income tax, stamp duty, general and
special consumption tax (GCT and SCT), customs duty, transfer tax, property tax, education tax,
travel tax, and betting and gambling tax. The three major taxes, the GCT, SCT, and income tax,
account for approximately 70 percent of total tax revenues. Although the Government has
removed a number of GCT exemptions in a series of reforms during FY 2009/10, the uniformity
of the tax code continues to be affected by numerous discretionary tax waivers, exemptions, and
incentives. Finally, Jamaica ranks 174th out of 183 economies in the costs of paying taxes.
According to Doing Business 2010, an average small-to-medium size manufacturing company in
Jamaica pays a 51.3 percent tax on its profits, has to make 72 separate payments, and spends 414
hours to pay the taxes (twice the time required in the next highest comparator country).

Tax Policy Reforms
84.     High tax rates and complicated procedures to comply with tax policy reduce firm
competitiveness and encourage tax evasion and avoidance. Studies have pointed to the
prominence of the informal sector in Jamaica, with estimates ranging from 40 to 44 percent of
the official GDP in 2001 and the tax system is considered to be one of the driving causes of the
expansion of informal activities (IADB 2006). The burden therefore falls on those in the formal
sector, further creating perverse incentives and dampening productivity. The literature has also
documented the low rates of growth of productivity in Jamaica and the consequent loss of market
share by Jamaican exporters.

85.     The distortions in the incentives regime reduce revenue collection and hinder
efficient allocation of investment. The Jamaican tax structure has a complex and extensive
system of incentives, many of which have accumulated over more than half a century and are


                                               31
accessible to local and foreign investors. The incentives provide income tax relief as well as
concessions on import taxes and duties to eligible enterprises for up to 15 years, while some
incentives provide other benefits such as capital allowances. Incentives can be discretionary;
many are specific to particular sectors, while others are available to any eligible applicant.
Holden and Holden (2005) were able to identify over 200,000 different incentives, but
mentioned that there may be even more. The identified incentives alone, according to the
authors, imply forgone revenue of about 20 percent of total government revenue. Other studies of
the incentive regime in Jamaica suggest that there is substantial bias in favor of capital-intensive
projects generally, and particularly projects of a larger nature (Artana and Navajas, 2004), which
discriminates among smaller local firms.

86.      Persistent difficulties in the external environment have limited fiscal space and have
constrained the GoJ to making only small strides in improving the uniformity of the tax
code. A proposal to lower the corporate income tax from 33.33 percent to 25 percent (in line
with the current 25 percent tax rate on personal income tax) has been postponed due to the
expected negative revenue implications. Before moving ahead with tax policy simplification, the
Government wants to strengthen the Tax Administration first to ensure that any tax policy
change does not cause a significant decline in revenues. The authorities did, however,
temporarily increase some categories of payroll tax: tax rates for income between J$5-10 million
and over J$10 million were adjusted from 25 percent to 27.5 percent and 35 percent,
respectively, until March 31, 2011. However, even prior to the announcement of this increase,
the tax rolls reflected less than 700 individuals with declared incomes above J$10 million, thus
illustrating the limitations of relying on taxing high earners to buttress fiscal revenues.

87.     The GoJ has made some progress in reducing the use of tax incentives and waivers.
A July 21, 2010 Cabinet decision (#28/2010) and follow-up measures taken by the Government
on November 15, 2010 instituted a freeze on the issuance of new statutory and discretionary
waivers and mandated publication of all waivers on the MoF website. However, waivers for
humanitarian purposes and charitable organizations were exempted from this requirements, and
additionally, waivers in the “unspecified? category were allowed up to a monthly maximum of
J$140 million. The objective of the policy was to limit the use of waivers while the GoJ, with the
help of an IADB-financed consultant, examines the current structure of the waivers and incentive
packages, estimates the foregone revenue, and develops a long-term waiver policy and strategy
as part of the broader agenda of tax policy reform. Between December 2010 and March 2011,
however, the use of waivers exceeded the stipulated limit. In follow-up discussions with the
IADB, which is closely following this reform area, the GoJ has revised upward the waiver limit
and has agreed to apply the December-March deviations against the new cap so that the new
annual limits would not be exceeded. The agreement has been documented in a joint Technical
Memorandum and compliance will be closely monitored by both GoJ and the IADB.

Tax Administration Reforms
88.     The GoJ has completed the first step in the amalgamation of payroll taxes. Prior to
the reform, taxpayers had to file and pay each of the following five taxes separately: national
insurance scheme, national housing trust, HEART for training, education tax and PAYE income
tax. To ease tax collection, simplify the structure of payroll taxes, and reduce the costs of paying
them, the GoJ developed a four-phased approach:


                                                32
     (a) Phase 1: A new payroll tax form was gazetted on November 15, 2010 and made
         effective January 1, 2011. Under the new form, taxpayers can file all five payroll taxes
         with a single form and make a single payment (in person or online) instead of five
         separate payments. The filing of annual returns for the 2011 tax year will also be
         consolidated.

     (b) Phase 2: Tax filing will be simplified for the self employed and own account.

     (c) Phase 3: Five different payroll taxes will be rationalized to a common base. Currently
         each contribution is deducted from a different base.

     (d) Phase 4: Five different payroll taxes will be consolidated.

89.     The GoJ has merged Inland Revenue, Taxpayer Audit and Assessment, and the Tax
Administration Services Departments into Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ) to increase
the efficiency of tax administration. Under the new structure, the existing departments have
been consolidated into a single unit with the responsibility for administering domestic taxes,
while Jamaica Customs became an International Tax Authority operating as an Executive
Agency and the Taxpayer Appeals Department became a separate appellate jurisdiction under the
MoF. The TAJ is led by a Commissioner General with the support of three Deputies with
responsibilities for Management Services, Operations, and Legal Support. The requisite
amendments to the Revenue Administration Act were enacted on April 1, 2011, and the TAJ has
been operational since May 2011. Several activities have already begun to take place, to ensure
the smooth operation and transition including establishment of a head office, sustained
communications with external stakeholders, the relocation of certain aspects of operations
(accounts, training, human resource, etc) and the redeployment of senior managers.

90.     The GoJ has strengthened the large taxpayer office, which is a one-stop-shop for all
tax payments by large taxpayers (gross revenues of J$500 million and above). The
Government has created a concept of one-stop-shop by establishing “Client Relationship
Offices? in each of the large tax payer office. As a result, taxpayers interface with only one
office for 14 different services.16 The Client Relations Offices significantly eases the costs of
paying taxes for large taxpayers, which account for 80 percent of all tax revenue collected. There
are currently two such offices in Kingston and Montego Bay, and the GoJ has increased their
staff complement to reach a greater number of taxpayers. When opened on April 1, 2009, these
offices operated on a pilot basis. As of March 2011, 149 of the 473 largest taxpayers were using
the office with the availability of full range of services, and the collections from clients
represented more than 42 percent of all tax revenues.

91.    The GoJ has significantly eased the filing and payment of taxes by broadening the
availability of electronic filing and payment to all taxpayers and all taxes.17 In October 2008,
the authorities introduced online filing and payment of GCT and SCT. One year later, the


16
    The services being provided by the Client Relation office include: registration, payment, auditing, debt
management, tax compliance certificate, property tax services, stamp duty, transfer tax, training on taxes, e-filing,
courier services and after hour services.
17
   The Jamaica Tax Payment Portal is accessible at www.jamaicatax-online.gov.jm.


                                                        33
authorities broadened the scope to the filing and payment of payroll deductions. In March 2010,
the authorities made further advances by allowing online filing and payment of individual and
corporate income tax, education tax for the self-employed, and NIS. Finally, in December 2010,
the national housing trust contributions also became available for online payment, thereby
allowing all tax types to be filed and paid online. The online portal is user-friendly, allows for
users to save their return and to complete it a later date, and a toll-free customer care line is
available for tax-related questions as well as technical support. The online portal also cuts down
on errors in submitted returns by validating the information at the point of user entry and
therefore increases efficiency and reduces the need for Tax Administration to enter data. The
current penetration of the online filing and payment is quite low—less than 1 percent of all
taxpayers and taxes collected—although year-on-year growth rates have been very rapid.
Additional take-up is likely to be limited by the lack of broad public awareness/trust of the
system. To address these issues, the GoJ plans on launching a public awareness campaign and to
broaden the payment options to include debit cards and bank transfers.

92.     The FSDPL2 prior actions in the area of tax reform include an indicative trigger for
this operation envisaged under the FSDPL1 as well as an additional substantive action in
the area of tax administration. The additional action reflects the substantial advances made in
consolidating the previously disjointed tax administration functions as well as the progress in the
Government’s efforts to simplify tax filing and payment through the amalgamation of payroll
taxes. Furthermore, the original indicative trigger envisaged under the FSDPL1 has been split in
two parts (two prior actions) to differentiate actions related to tax policy and tax administration.
All parts of the actions below have been fully met by the Government:

(6)    The Borrower has continued to implement a uniform tax code by instituting interim
       measures (including, inter alia, freezing the issuance of new statutory waivers and
       reducing the issuance of discretionary waivers by the Minister of Finance) until a tax
       policy reform is implemented, as evidenced by: (i) the Borrower’s Cabinet Decision (No.
       28/2010) dated July 21, 2010; (ii) the measures adopted by the MoF dated November 15,
       2010 and published on the MoF’ website on November 15, 2010
       (www.mof.gov.jm/pressreleases); and (iii) a letter from the Borrower’s Financial
       Secretary dated July 14, 2011 summarizing said Cabinet Decision and the November 15,
       2010 measures.

(7)    (a) (i) The Borrower’s Parliament has approved the consolidation of the departments of
       Inland Revenue, Taxpayer Audit and Assessment, and Tax Administration Services into a
       single tax administration department called Tax Administration Jamaica, as evidenced by
       the enactment of the Revenue Administration (Amendment) Act, 2011, dated April 1,
       2011; and (ii) the Borrower has prepared a detailed transition plan for implementing the
       organizational, administrative and operational changes introduced in the Revenue
       Administration (Amendment) Act, 2011 dated April 1, 2011, as evidenced by a letter
       issued by the Borrower’s Financial Secretary dated July 14, 2011; and

       (b) The Borrower has continued to implement a simplified process for paying taxes and
       improving tax collection efficiency and client services, as evidenced by: (i) the
       implementation of the first phase of the amalgamation of payroll taxes which
       consolidates five payments and five forms for five different taxes into one payment and


                                                34
       one form, as evidenced by the issuance of the Income Tax (Amalgamated Payroll
       Remittance) Regulations, 2010 dated November 15, 2010; (ii) the creation of client
       services units in large taxpayer offices to establish a one-stop shop for all tax payments
       (including providing fourteen different services for large taxpayers and covering one
       hundred forty nine of the four hundred seventy three large taxpayers in the Borrower’s
       territory); and (iii) the extension of online tax filing and payment to all taxpayers and to
       all tax instruments, as evidenced by a letter issued by the Borrower’s Financial Secretary
       dated July 14, 2011 and the upgrading of the Borrower’s website for purposes of online
       tax filing and payment (http:/ http://www.jamaicatax-online.gov.jm).

93.   The expected outcome from the FSDPL2 (FY2011/12) in this area is the end-series
outcome envisioned in the FSDPL1:

      Improved PEFA rating of “Collection of tax payments? to B in FY2011/12 from a
       baseline of: D+ in 2007/08.

        IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A. Link to the Country Partnership Strategy

94.    The proposed FSDPL2, which is the second in a series of two programmatic DPLs
envisaged in the current CPS, is consistent with the main CPS pillars. The FY2010-13
World Bank Group’s CPS (Report No. 52849) was discussed by the Board on March 23, 2010.
The proposed FSDPL2 reflects the GoJ’s intention of addressing fiscal and debt challenges. The
GoJ’s efforts are based on three critical and interrelated development challenges under the
Economic Stability Pillar of the CPS: (i) promoting fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) improving
transparency and efficiency of public financial management and budget processes; and (iii)
reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system. Fiscal space remains limited
and the interventions identified in the strategy and the proposed FSDPL2 have been carefully
chosen to help the GoJ achieve its objectives while mindful of its limited human and financial
resources.

B. Collaboration with the IMF and other donors
95.     A total of nineteen International Development Partners (IDPs) are active in
Jamaica. Most support is directed to the social sector, followed by budgetary support with a
focus on growth and competitiveness. Two bilateral IDPs (CIDA and DFID) have regional
strategies while USAID, IADB, IMF, and the World Bank have country strategies. All strategies
and sectoral support are provided in line with government priorities articulated through the PIOJ
and in the MTF. The specific programs of each of the main donors are summarized in Annex 6.

96.    The IFIs coordinate closely on their support to the reform program of the GoJ. The
reform actions supported by this DPL are complemented by the IMF SBA and the public sector
reform program of the IADB. Given the critical importance of debt and fiscal issues, these
themes are common across the structural benchmarks of the IMF and the prior actions of the
Bank and the IADB. There is full alignment between the Program Matrix of this DPL and the


                                               35
PBL of the CDB. There is a division of labor among the institutions to ensure complementarity.
As part of this coordination, the World Bank, the IMF and the IADB had joint missions to
support debt management reforms in May and October 2010. The World Bank is also
coordinating with the IFIs in sequencing of the policy actions. This coordination is important to
ensure that the GoJ’s financial needs are met in a timely manner while reform momentum is
maintained. The main synergies between the reforms supported by the IFIs are:

       (a) Implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility Framework;

       (b) Public Sector Rationalization;

       (c) Improving Efficiency of Public Expenditure Management and of Tax Policy and
           Administration;

       (d) Strengthening of Debt Management; and

       (e) Strengthening internal and external controls.

97.    The Bank consults extensively with the major donors in Jamaica. The consultations
take place through regular meetings of the Debt and Growth Thematic Working Group chaired
by the Bank in addition to quarterly meetings with the IMF and meetings at the local level with
all donors to better coordinate and streamline activities under the various policy matrices. The
extensive program of support to reform debt management practices in Jamaica over the next
three years—launched through joint missions of the Bank, the IMF, and the IADB—is an
example of the consultative process to reform implementation taken by the IFIs in Jamaica.
Another example is SEMCAR (Supporting Economic Management in the Caribbean), a CIDA-
financed and Bank-executed program which supports the GoJ in the areas of public financial
management, tax policy and administration, and customs.

98.     On February 4, 2010 the IMF Board approved a 27-month US$1.27 billion Stand-
By Arrangement (SBA) for balance of payments support. Completion of the third review on
January 14, 2011, enabled the disbursement of SDR31.9 million (US$49.3 million), bringing
total disbursements to SDR541.8million (US$838.2 million). Up through the third review, fiscal
performance was on track with all quantitative performance targets met. The fourth and fifth
reviews, originally scheduled for end-July, have been delayed but discussions between the GoJ
and the IMF are ongoing (see the IMF Assessment Letter in Annex 4 for the current status of
discussions between the Government and the IMF). In addition, the IMF, directly and through
CARTAC, has been providing technical assistance on debt management, tax issues, investment
schemes, and the stability of the financial system.

99.    The IADB disbursed US$600 million in budget support policy-based loans (PBL) in
the 2010 calendar year. The last disbursement of US$200 million took place in December 2010,
following the previous US$200 million tranche in August. Additionally, in 2011 the IADB
disbursed a US$50 million PBL for Human Capital Protection and another US$60 million PBL
for Public Financial and Performance Management was approved in April 2011. Furthermore,
the IADB has had a long relationship with the MoF, the Office of the Prime Minister, and the
PIOJ providing technical assistance in public financial management, budget processes, central
government operations, and investment prioritization.


                                               36
                         Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality
  Principle 1: Reinforce ownership.
  The proposed DPL was developed within the objectives of the Government’s Medium-Term Socio-
  Economic Policy Framework and 25-year National Development Plan – Vision 2030, which is being
  widely consulted with stakeholders and broader civil society and which will establish clear
  development priorities. The priority legislative agenda is developed in consultation with the
  Parliamentary leadership on an ongoing basis. The Bank support focuses on (1) promoting fiscal
  sustainability through controlling overall public sector balances and debt generation; (2) increasing
  the efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes; and (3) reducing distortions
  and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system. These focus areas, including the rationalization of
  Public Bodies, have all benefitted from broad political support. The DPL is strongly underpinned by
  prior and ongoing analytical and fiduciary work, including the Country Economic Memorandum
  (2011), Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (2011), Poverty Assessment (2006), the
  CFAA/CPAR (2006), and PEFA (2007), as well as non-Bank AAA, including the Matalon Report
  on Tax Reform (2004) and the IMF/CARTAC report on Tax Incentives (2008).
  Principle 2: Agree upfront with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
  accountability framework.
  The Bank’s support is summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix. The Bank, the IADB, and
  the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) are providing support in the form of loans or contingent
  credit. The IMF has an SBA of SDR820.5 million for Jamaica. The Bank, the IMF, and the IADB
  draw on the country’s development plan, thereby ensuring coordination among them and
  consistency of support. All three institutions have been supporting measures to improve fiscal and
  debt management, rationalize Public Bodies, and strengthen tax administration and policy.
  Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
  circumstances.
  The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), completed in 2006, indicates that the
  fiduciary environment in Jamaica is generally adequate, stating that the treasury management is
  solid and the internal control has in place a legal framework and independence, which are the basis
  for a sound Public Financial Management (PFM) system. The funds from the proposed DPL would
  be handled through this system.
  Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement.
  The Bank’s policy matrix has only seven prior actions (Annex 1). They address key development
  policies prioritized in the CPS including actions in promoting fiscal and debt sustainability to
  enhance growth and reduce poverty and inequality.
  Principle 5. Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
  based financial support.
  As agreed with the Government, this DPL is the second in a series of two programmatic operations,
  timed to meet the country’s financing needs, and is to be evaluated and monitored for results.
  Monitoring and evaluation of the program will take place within the government’s own processes.
  The policy matrix contains ten outcome indicators (Annex 1), which are assessed as part of the
  operation implementation and are closely linked to the supported policy actions.


C. Relationship with Other Bank Operations
100. The proposed operation is the second in the programmatic series of two single-
tranche loans focused on fiscal sustainability. The proposed FSDPL2 advances the reform
program supported under the FSDPL1 by supporting the continuation and extension of the GoJ



                                                  37
program in FY2009/10. Moreover, the FSDPL series builds upon the initial achievements
supported by the previous Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL, which was approved in January
2009. Finally, proposed FSDPL2 is also designed to complement the ongoing and planned
investment lending program under the current CPS by supporting the GoJ efforts to provide a
stable macroeconomic framework and improved public sector effectiveness to stimulate growth
and fund priority social and investment programs.

101. The actions supported by the proposed operation are part of a longer standing
policy dialogue that has been supported through both AAA and lending activities. The
current fiscal challenges underscore the importance of this operation in helping the Government
maintain social and economic gains from other Bank-financed operations and in helping create
the environment for further support. Consistent with the overarching themes of economic
stability and promotion of inclusive and sustained growth in the Bank’s program, the gains from
this DPL are expected to minimize delays in existing Bank-financed projects in education,
health, social protection, basic infrastructure and disaster management. They will also reduce the
risk to the recent Jamaica Energy Security and Efficiency Enhancement loan for US$15 million
(P112780).

102. A Trust Fund secured from DFID is designed to support the proposed reform
actions under the FSDPL2. The World Bank and DFID have signed an agreement to jointly
support reforms in the areas of debt management, parliamentary oversight of budgeting
processes, and improved communication of government reforms through a Technical Assistance
(TA) Trust Fund. DFID will provide £920,000 over a three-year period to finance TA activities
under Bank management, and the implementation of these activities in all areas has commenced.

D. Lessons Learned
103. The Bank has maintained an active engagement with the GoJ by supporting the
Government program through a series of Country Partnership Strategies, and this
experience has informed the design of the proposed operation. Key lessons relevant in the
context of lending operations were that lending activities should take into account fiscal
constraints and consider the implementation capacity of government agencies, which restricts the
effectiveness of lending in some cases. Bearing these lessons in mind, the previous Fiscal and
Debt Sustainability DPL (January 2009) and the first programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL
(February 2010) were aligned with the Government’s policy reform program and its institutional
capacity. Moreover, the disbursement amount of the FSDPL1 was adjusted during the operation
preparation in order to align the amount with the Government liquidity needs. The proposed
programmatic FSDPL2 builds on the success of the previous operations.

104. Several important lessons have been learned from the Implementation Completion
and Results Report (ICR) of the 2009 Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL. The lessons from
the ICR (Report No. ICR00001658) include (i) the importance of timing of the operations, taking
into consideration Government financing needs as well as the momentum for reform; (ii) use of
the programmatic approach to frame the reform program in a medium-term perspective; and (iii)
accompanying development policy lending with technical assistance (TA) and capacity building.
The proposed FSDPL2 takes all of these suggestions on board by supporting the continuation of



                                               38
the GoJ reform program in the context of a programmatic series and being accompanied by a
large TA component in support of the DMU reforms.

105.    Aspects of the previous operation—including the JDX, sequencing of the reform
agenda, and the setting of triggers—also provided important lessons for the design of
FSDPL2. The success of the JDX underscored both the Government’s commitment to reforms
and the broad consensus among stakeholders on the urgency and necessity of the Government’s
actions. The Government’s sequenced approach to reform implementation by resolving fiscal
and debt challenges first and then moving on to the growth agenda has shown the importance of
aligning the Bank support to government priorities. Finally, the formulation of the investment
prioritization and MTEF triggers as covering all MDAs in the span of one year—which has been
subsequently revised to six largest ministries accounting for 91 percent of central government
spending—has shown the team that setting highly ambitious targets may not be consistent with a
sequenced approach to reform phase-in, the latter being the preferred method of reform
implementation according to international experience.

E. Analytical Underpinnings
106. The proposed FSDPL2 supports the Government’s medium-term development
strategy, and draws upon a large body of analytical work. Within this framework, it focuses
on policies and institutional aspects related to fiscal and debt sustainability. Box 3 below
presents the links between prior actions and various AAA work.

F. Country Consultations

107.    The Government’s reform program is an outcome of extensive consultations with
stakeholders. Through the PIOJ, the Government has undertaken a broad consultation process
on its long-term development plan—Vision 2030 National Development Plan, tabled in
Parliament in May 2009—which incorporates many of the reforms supported by the DPL series.
Vision 2030 was publicly announced and consultations have taken place throughout the country
with various target groups including youth and community groups, special interest groups, and
the emigrant Diaspora (via the web). The PSTU program incorporates a well-structured


                                                 40
consultative process. The governance structure of the transformation project includes a Sub-
Committee of the Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister, to approve, give direction and oversight
to the restructuring of the Public Sector, and the Consultative Monitoring Group (CMG)
comprising representatives of Government, private sector, trade unions, academia and the
Opposition to review the strategies being pursued by the PSTU and monitor their
implementation. Implementation and change management “transition? teams have been formed
in each MDA to assist their colleagues to grasp all of the critical issues. Privatization and debt
management reforms of the government benefited from consultations with the Jamaican public
sector, senior private sector leaders, International Financial Institutions, the Commonwealth
Secretariat and UK Debt Management Office.

108. Moreover, specific consultations regarding the reforms supported by FSDPL2 have
been undertaken with a broad group of stakeholders. Six consultations were organized in
Jamaica in 2010, including the Cabinet and members of Parliament. There were also a number of
video and audio conferences with local counterparts. The Bank benefitted from interaction with
the MoF, the Office of the Prime Minister (specifically the Public Sector Transformation Unit
and representatives from the Cabinet Office), the PIOJ, the Bank of Jamaica, Tax Administration
Jamaica, the AG Office, Petroleum Corporation of Jamaica, the Development Bank of Jamaica,
and the Office of the Services Commission. Consultations were also held with the International
Development Partners and civil society groups, including academia and students who attend a
discussion at the University of the West Indies in September 2010. The Bank also benefitted
from discussions with select heads of the various Enterprise Teams responsible for leading the
divestment process of specific government assets (including Sugar Estates, Air Jamaica,
Clarendon Alumina Partners and the Pegasus Hotel).

109. The stakeholders were upbeat about the Government’s economic reform program
as the GoJ successfully completed a historic JDX and tabled Jamaica’s first consolidated
budget in Parliament. To maintain the momentum, the stakeholders identified a number priority
areas for support: (i) implementation of stronger governance and fiscal responsible procedures;
(ii) debt and fiscal sustainability to achieve economic stability and the fiscal space needed to
undertake critical public sector investment in support of long-term growth; (iii) rationalization of
the government; and (iv) continued tax reforms to maximize revenue collection while improving
and business competitiveness. The impact of the recent economic crises has been pronounced in
terms of limiting tax reforms, which compromises the government’s ability to meet the agreed
deliverables. The broad consensus among the Development Partners was that progress on the
agreed reforms has been uneven and that the process of legislative changes is quite lengthy and
much needed capacity strengthening in a number of institutions have been either delayed or
postponed.

G. Poverty and Social Impacts

110. The actions supported by the proposed FSDPL2 are expected to have a positive
overall distributional impact. The Poverty Assessment and the Public Expenditure Review
have found that the high debt has adversely impacted the poor by reducing fiscal space for
priority social spending and investment programs, while macroeconomic volatility and inflation
have had a disproportionately negative impact on the poor. In particular, high inflation in the past



                                                41
had eroded much of the purchasing power of transfers provided under the conditional cash
transfer program. Since the expected outcomes from the DPL series include a more stable macro
environment, reduced debt burden, increased fiscal space for productive and poverty-alleviating
expenditures, and improved growth outlook, the broad distributional impacts are expected to be
pro-poor.

111. The Bank has undertaken a comprehensive Poverty and Social Impact Assessment
(PSIA) to evaluate the distributional impacts of tax reform and Public Bodies
rationalization components of the Government’s reform program. For these two reforms, the
PSIA has been able to identify specific distributional transmission channels and evaluate—using
both quantitative and qualitative methods—the impacts on the poor. Annex 9 discusses these
PSIA findings in some detail, while the paragraphs below summarize the main results. The
poverty and distributional impacts of other aspects of the Government’s program are expected to
be broader in nature and in line with the arguments of the previous paragraph.

112. The short-term, direct impact of the tax reform is likely to have been somewhat
negative, but the medium- and long-term effects of the reform package are expected to be
positive. Simulations with a general equilibrium model of Jamaica coupled to a micro-
accounting module for translating macro- and sector-level changes into poverty and
distributional outcomes show that the tax reform on its own would have likely led to a small
increase in poverty. However, the progressivity of the petroleum tax combined with a highly
progressive incidence of the loss of interest income from the JDX has lessened the impacts on
the poorest households. In addition, the substantial improvement in the fiscal position due to
these reforms is expected to yield a positive growth dividend and therefore help poverty
reduction. Therefore, the combined effect of the package of fiscal (tax and debt exchange)
reforms is estimated to have reduced both poverty and inequality.

113. The overall poverty and distributional impacts of public bodies’ rationalization are
likely to be small. Households with members employed in sectors under rationalization (sugar,
aluminum, and ethanol) have consumption per capita 30 percent lower than other households and
are three times more likely to be poor. However, these households account for only 0.2 percent
of the Jamaican population (5,626 Jamaicans living in 2,274 households). A number of these
households already have access to social safety nets: more than 13 percent of the potentially
affected households are beneficiaries of the Jamaican CCT program PATH, compared with less
than 7 percent of non-affected households who are PATH beneficiaries. Should some of the non-
eligible households fall below the poverty line when some family members lose jobs as a result
of the rationalization program, these households would become eligible for PATH and would be
protected under that program. Moreover, displaced sugar workers are eligible for compensation
under the Sugar Transformation Payment (STP) program, which pays J$170,000 to displaced
females and J$150,000 to displaced males in addition to making tuition and clinic attendance
payments on behalf of the displaced workers.

114. Despite the limited overall impact, qualitative work has revealed substantial
vulnerabilities in the sugar sector. Many members of rural communities which previously
relied on income from sugar factories/estates have resorted to “hustling?: selling juices, peppers,
limes, and other small crops or becoming taxi drivers. Community interviews—although not
representative due to small sample size—revealed that as many as half of those previously


                                                42
employed have not been able to secure formal employment since. Limited coping mechanisms
are a major source of vulnerability: many households borrowed in anticipation of receiving STP
but have experienced difficulties in collecting payments due to complicated procedures (which
require opening one or more bank accounts) and being offered in-kind payments (e.g.,
motorcycles) instead of cash. In some cases, parents resorted to limiting the school attendance of
their children to two-three days per week and some households reduced their consumption to less
than two full meals per day and/or started stealing sugar cane from the fields to supplement the
nutritional intake. However, so far few, if any, households have lost their homes and most
community members remain optimistic about the future, believing that privatization would lead
to increased investment in the factories and improved management practices.

115. Although workers employed in the industries to be privatized—like most public
sector workers—will have a more difficult time finding new employment, training
programs can make a big difference. Compared with workers in other industries/sectors,
public sector workers in industries with entities to be privatized not only face a higher
probability of losing their job but also a more difficult time finding new jobs once unemployed.
However, employment probabilities are substantially higher with workers with above-average
levels of schooling. Moreover, even after controlling for all other determinants such as age,
gender, education, and sector of employment, access to specialized training (such as
government-sponsored HEART/ National Training Agency programs) makes a significant
difference: after one year, those who received training have a probability of getting a job more
than 6 percentage points higher than those who did not get training.

116. The Government has developed a wide array of tools to help mitigate any adverse
distributional impacts. In December 2008, the GoJ set up a special program through the
HEART Trust/National Training Agency to retrain laid-off workers in order to assist them to
gain alternative employment. The PATH program, which reaches about 14 percent of the
population, has been used as a vehicle to help the poor with additional payments during periods
of natural disasters as well as the recent global crisis.18 While a detailed impact evaluation of the
PATH program is ongoing, existing evidence indicates that the program targeting is good with
most participants poor or close to being poor. PATH is also piloting a “Steps to Work? initiative
aimed to help working able adults in PATH families to engage in activities that will help them
find and retain gainful employment such as job search assistance, medical education, training,
and small business assistance. The STP payments have been distributed to 1,200 recipients by
September 2010 and in March 2011 the workers aspect of the grant program was completed.




18
   PATH or Program for the Advancement through Health and Education is a conditional cash transfer (CCT)
program geared to provide cost effective social assistance to the extremely poor in exchange of them complying
with conditions that promote the development of their human capital. The largest proportion of beneficiaries is
drawn from the poorest quintile (poorest 20 percent), which is better targeting when compared to many similar
programs in the LAC region. The program's benefit level were adjusted twice in 2008: once to keep with inflation
and maintain its purchasing power (April 2008) and once to allow for higher incentives for secondary school kids
and boys at all grade level to encourage them to attend school and complete high school (December 2008). In
response to the financial crisis, the government has expanded coverage in 2009 by 10 percent to reach 327,000
beneficiaries at the end of December 2009 with plans to reach 360,000 beneficiaries by March 2010.



                                                      43
H. Environmental Aspects
117. The specific policies supported by this DPL operation are not expected to have
significant effects on the environment, forests or other natural resources. Jamaica has the
institutional capacity and the necessary arrangements to assess and manage adverse
environmental effects. The National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA) has been in
place since April 2001 as a means for conducting environmental impact assessments under
acceptable international standards. The Development Bank of Jamaica and other investment
promotion agencies (e.g., Jamaica trade and Invest, formerly JAMPRO) require that all proposed
projects conform to the environmental laws of Jamaica and must comply with regulations
stipulated by the NEPA. Currently, limited fiscal space hampers the ability of relevant GoJ
agencies to perform such tasks effectively and this capacity may come under increased pressure
from potential additional investments in mining and agriculture following privatization in these
sectors. However, the successful implementation of this DPL operation would in fact create the
fiscal space needed for the GoJ to invest in critical environmental public goods such as
protection of watersheds and forests, zoning and flood prevention, protection of coastal
resources, stricter/effective enforcement of physical planning and environmental laws and
regulations, and better integration of institutional mandates regarding environmental
management. Indeed, an Integrated Environmental Assessment was completed in April 2009 in
anticipation of the divestiture of the Sugar Company by the Sugar Industry Authority and the
Ministry of Agriculture has already taken steps to initiate the process of Strategic Environmental
Assessment.

118. Environmental and climate change considerations feature prominently in the
Government’s long-term strategic plans. The GoJ through Vision 2030 Jamaica: National
Development Plan (2009-2030) has outlined its priorities and actions with regard to environment
and climate change in the combined sector plan on Natural Resources and Environmental
Management and Hazard Risk Reduction and Climate Change (2009). The combined sector
plan highlights the key challenges and identifies four broad areas for priority attention as
follows: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management; Natural Resources Management;
Environmental Governance; and Natural Hazards Mitigation and Climate Change. A primary
focus of Vision 2030 Jamaica is to adapt to climate change through mainstreaming climate risks
into government policies and plans, identifying strategic priorities and adoption of best practice,
as well as promoting greater public awareness of the issues. Vision 2030 Jamaica is further
complemented by the Second National Communication, which spans from 2006 through 2011. It
sets out steps taken or envisaged to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change for the water
resources, coastal resources, human health, human settlement and agricultural sectors.

I. Fiduciary Aspects
Public Financial Management System

119. The GoJ is making progress in improving public financial management system to
mitigate fiduciary risks and the overall fiduciary environment is considered appropriate
for development policy loan support. The 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial in
Accountability (PEFA) Assessment identified a number of areas where the PFM system was
performing adequately, but also noted some areas for improvement. The PEFA Assessment built


                                                44
on the assessment of Jamaica’s PFM environment during a joint Country Fiduciary Assessment
(CFAA/CPAR) that was conducted in 2006. The two assessments provide an indication of
strengths and weaknesses in the management of public finances. The areas of adequate
performance identified during the assessment included revenue forecasting, budget classification,
and oversight of fiscal risk. On the other hand, areas where improvement is required included
multiyear fiscal planning, expenditure policy, quality and timeliness of the preparation of annual
financial statements, external audits payroll controls and controls for non salary expenditure.
Significant delays were noted in the preparation and submission of financial statements for audit.

120. The Government has adopted a number of key recommendations of the Country
Fiduciary Assessment to address existing weaknesses. The key measures are centered on the
implementation of the FRF and the introduction of an investment prioritization system together
with the adoption of the elements of a MTEF. In addition, the Government is working on
strengthening the technical basis of budgeting and financial management through: (i) improving
accounting and financial reporting and eventually moving to an accrual system of accounting;
(ii) introducing an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS); (iii)
strengthening internal control and internal audit systems; and (iv) strengthening external audit by
providing more independence and improving the capacity of the office of the Auditor General.
The GoJ is making progress in improving public financial management system to further
mitigate fiduciary risks and the overall fiduciary environment is considered appropriate for
development policy loan support.

121. Public procurement capacity in Jamaica is still evolving. The Government adopted the
public sector procurement policy with the objectives of: (i) maximizing economy and efficiency
in procurement; (ii) fairness, integrity and public confidence in the procurement process; (iii)
sustainable development through minimizing negative impact on the environment; and (iv)
fostering national growth and development. The Government adopted appropriate rules and
regulations for improving public procurement under the Contractor-General Act of December,
2008 and also amended the same in October 2010 and January 2011 for further improvement. In
addition, the Government also prepared a Public Procurement Handbook. However, the
challenges for public procurement in Jamaica are to make the procurement system more efficient
by improving procurement performance and effective monitoring. Specific issues which could be
addressed within the existing legal framework include, inter alia: addressing delays in
contracting caused by bottlenecks in the contract approval process and strengthening the internal
control and internal audit of procurement activities in public agencies and project implementing
units.

Foreign exchange system

122. The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment of the BoJ and finalized its report in
June 2010. The assessment found adequate external audit and financial reporting frameworks at
the BoJ. However, the report concluded that the legal structure needed strengthening to increase
operational independence and autonomy. It also identified some areas for improvement in the
internal audit function of BoJ. In addition, the report recommended measures to further
strengthening the effectiveness of the bank's governance and oversight mechanisms. The report
found that the control environment within which foreign exchange is managed is satisfactory.
The finding was similar in the Financial System Stability Assessment, which was carried out in


                                                45
2006 jointly by the IMF and the World Bank. The financial statements of BoJ are audited by an
international firm of accountants and are published on the BoJ’s website. Any findings and
recommendations issued as a result of the audit exercises are considered by an Audit Committee
of the Board. The management of BoJ agreed with the findings of the Safeguard Assessment
Report and has commenced implementation some of its main recommendations.

123. The proposed FSDPL2 will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy support. Loan proceeds will be disbursed once effectiveness has been
declared. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed into an account designated by the Borrower
that is part of the country foreign exchange reserves account at the Central Bank of Jamaica. The
administration of this loan will be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. Given that
the Borrower’s current public financial management system is satisfactory and the fiduciary
environment at the Central Bank of Jamaica is adequate, no specific audit of the deposit account
will be required.

J. Loan Administration
124. The Bank will disburse the loan proceeds into a BoJ account denominated in US
dollars. The BoJ will immediately credit the disbursed amounts to the account of the Ministry of
Finance. Within a week of this funds transfer, the MoF will accordingly provide the Bank with a
written confirmation.

K. Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
125. The MoF and the PIOJ will play the primary role in coordinating monitoring and
evaluation of program implementation. The government appointed a point person in the PIOJ
for coordinating the implementation of reforms supported by the FSDPL2. The Government and
the Bank will take advantage of several important data sources to assess progress of the FSDPL2
and the DPL series more broadly, including:

      Central and nonfinancial public sector budget monitoring from the MoF
      Statistical Institute of Jamaica
      Central Bank of Jamaica reports and analysis
      Reviews and analyses of laws and regulations by the Bank and other stakeholders
      Data from key Government agencies such as the PIOJ and the Auditor General
      Financial audits and follow up of CPAR and CFAA recommendations
      Bank, CDB, IADB and IMF supervision missions and reports. The World Bank has been
       closely coordinating with the IMF on monitoring the economic and financial situation.

L. Risks
126. The reform program of the Government of Jamaica, to be supported by the
proposed FSDPL2, faces four types of significant risks: economic, political, institutional,
and natural disasters. Risks and mitigation measures are summarized below.




                                                46
127. Economic: The recovery from the global financial crisis has been slower than anticipated
and real GDP growth is expected to be modest in the medium term. Downside risks to growth in
Jamaica’s main trading partners could jeopardize the recovery in tourism and remittances.
Similarly, credit markets and the reserve coverage could be adversely affected should
international financial conditions deteriorate. Although fiscal and debt sustainability have been
substantially improved through reforms supported under FSDPL1, slower recovery or adverse
shocks to growth could weaken fiscal balances and reduce the ability of the Government to push
ahead with critical medium term reforms. For example, the Government has already decided to
postpone some reforms—such as the proposal to lower corporate income taxes to 25 percent, in
line with the personal income tax rate—due to concerns over revenue generation in the current
environment. The recent public sector salary increase—mandated by a Supreme Court ruling—
has further raised the wage bill to GDP ratio and has made the planned HR reforms even more
urgent. The delays in completing the fourth and fifth reviews under the IMF SBA program could
affect progress towards medium-term fiscal targets.

128. Mitigation: Since Jamaica is vulnerable to external shocks, prospects for mitigation are
limited. However, following the JDX and the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, a
number of external vulnerabilities have been significantly reduced. Although the IMF reviews
are delayed, the GoJ and the IMF maintain a close dialogue and the Government is committed to
medium-term fiscal sustainability. The GoJ is preparing a supplementary budget to finance the
public sector salary increase without affecting the primary balance targets. Moreover, the
Government was able to negotiate a three-year period over which the back wages would be paid,
demonstrating its commitment to limiting the growth in the wage bill and protecting fiscal
balances. To ensure the longer-term sustainability of the wage bill, the GoJ has prepared a
position paper outlining a drastic reduction in the number of wage bargaining units. The Bank
and DFID are supporting a multi-year, comprehensive restructuring of debt management in line
with international best practice. The Bank participates in ongoing macro-monitoring and
country dialogue and stands ready to adjust the program to mitigate risks as much as possible.
Other development partners are active in Jamaica with sizeable portfolio and resources for on-
demand technical assistance.

129. Political: The current Government came into power in the fall of 2007. It has a small
majority in Parliament. Although new elections are not due until 2012, it is possible that
elections could take place earlier. If political pressures were to increase, the Government may
postpone necessary but potentially unpopular measures which could jeopardize sustainability of
the fiscal consolidation. Certain discretionary actions, such as the Cabinet Decision to limit the
use of tax waivers and incentives, could also be reversed at a later date due to political pressures.
Finally, the recent security episode has highlighted the sometimes fragile nature of the social
compact in the country and the need for a long-resolution to the security and governance
challenges.

130. Mitigation: The political risk is reduced by the Government’s consultative approach to
reform implementation and the dialogue among country stakeholders on the fiscal and economic
costs of inaction. In particular, there is broad agreement among all stakeholders that the pre-
reform status quo was unsustainable and reforms were absolutely necessary. This is illustrated
by the fact that while previous attempts to raise gasoline taxes in Jamaica resulted in riots and
eventual roll-back of policy, the tax increase supported under FSDPL1 was well-received by the


                                                 47
general public who understood the urgent need to strengthen fiscal balances. The Government is
also committed to addressing security challenges, as evidenced by its tenacity in pursuing a
resolution to the May 2010 Tivoli Gardens incident, and has committed to develop and
implement a national safety and security strategy in the near term. IFIs and other donors are
heavily focused on building consensus for advancing critical public sector reforms.

131. Institutional capacity and reform implementation: The Government has embarked on
substantial public sector reforms which require changes in institutional structure and significant
enhancement in institutional capacity. The reform process could be delayed as the institutions try
to adjust to the changes and enhance their capacity. For example, as highlighted earlier in the
document, the transition to MTEF is a multi-year process that requires significant investments in
capacity building and aligning the orientation of the institutions towards medium term planning.
Similarly, the DMU reforms will require a substantial upgrading of technical and institutional
capacity. Finally, there may be short-term delays in reform implementation as the reform
strategies developed at the unit and ministry-level are subsumed into the broad overarching
rationalization plan of the PSTU.

132. Mitigation: Jamaica has well established institutions. The Government is committed to
reform and the development partners are committed to providing support and technical
assistance to improve institutional capacity and advance public sector reforms. For example, the
DMU reforms are being implemented with guidance from specialists in the Bank’s Treasury
department, and are being overseen by a high-level Debt Committee comprised of senior
members of the Government. The Bank is executing a £920,000 grant from DFID to provide
technical assistance for institutional changes including restructuring of the Debt Management
Unit, Parliamentary oversight of budgetary processes, and the Government communication
strategy.

133. Natural disasters and climate change: Natural disasters can derail economic growth,
limit the progress on poverty reduction, and pose a heavy fiscal burden, increasing indebtedness
and redirecting public resources away from long-term development plans. Jamaica is highly
vulnerable to droughts, floods, and hurricanes. The cumulative damage from the last three major
storms— Ivan (2004), Dean (2007), and Gustav (2008)—was over US$1 billion. The most recent
tropical storm Nicole caused a fiscal cost of 1 percent of the GDP to the GoJ budget. In general
for the Caribbean countries, the annualized cost of hurricanes is estimated to range from 0.13 to
1.93 percent of GDP. The emerging risks from climate change must also be taken into account in
long-term development planning to ensure that new projects take into account climate resilience.

134. Mitigation: The damage to major private sector enterprises is partly covered by
insurance. The GoJ participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. The Bank
is assisting Jamaica through investments in natural disaster risk mitigation with the Hurricane
Dean Emergency Recovery Loan and technical assistance for its safety net program to mitigate
adverse consequences on poverty. In January 2009, the National Water Sector Adaptation
Strategy and Plan of Action to address climate change were established with Bank assistance
and provide recommendations on key investments (capacity, institutional, policy and legislative,
etc) to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in the water sector. With joint support
from the WB and IADB, the GoJ is preparing a strategic program for climate adaptation under
the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR).

1.     Jamaica, which became a member of the International Monetary Fund on February 21,
1963, has a current IMF quota of SDR273.50 million (about US$429 million). The IMF conducts
regular Article IV consultations with Jamaica and the latest one was completed by the IMF
Executive Board on July 30, 2010. On February 4, 2010, the Executive Board of the IMF
approved a 27-month Stand-By Arrangement with Jamaica in the amount of SDR820.5 million
(about US$1.27 billion) to support the country’s economic reforms and help it cope with the
consequences of the global downturn. The third review of the Standby-By Arrangement was
completed on January 14, 2011 and enabled a further disbursement of SDR31.9 million (about
US$49.3 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR541.9 million
(about US$838.2 million).

2.    The IMF has provided the Bank with the below Assessment Letter dated August 5, 2011.

                       ANNEX 6: DONOR ACTIVITIES IN JAMAICA

3.      A total of nineteen International Development Partners are active in twelve sectors
with most support directed to the social sector, followed by budgetary support with strong
support for growth and competitiveness. Two bilateral Partners (CIDA and DFID) have
regional strategies while USAID, IADB, IMF, and the World Bank all have country strategies.
All strategies and sectoral support are provided in line with government priorities articulated
through the PIOJ and in the MTF. All the major donors interact regularly in the context of the
Debt and Growth Thematic Working Group meetings chaired by the World Bank.

4.      IADB: As identified in the Country Strategy for Jamaica, key areas of IADB support
include public financial management and private sector development, where the IADB
specifically supports improvements in the incentive framework and the business environment.
Specific reforms include reducing the transaction costs for titling and registering land, increasing
access to credit for sole proprietors and small businesses, and improving incentives for informal
businesses to become formal. In 2010, the GoJ received US$600 million in budget support from
the IADB, with the most recent disbursement of US$200 million coming on December 17, 2010,
via a Policy-Based Loan (PBL).

5.     IMF: The IMF program focuses on a three-pronged strategy of: (i) putting public
finances on a sustainable path that includes much-needed public sector reform; (ii) lowering
exceptionally high interest costs, addressing the problem of the debt overhang, and raising the
productivity of public spending; and (iii) reducing systemic risks through financial sector
regulatory reform. The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) to support these objectives was approved
on February 8, 2010, and spans through March 31, 2012 (see Annex 4 for additional details on
the IMF program in Jamaica).

6.      EU: EU support to Jamaica is anchored in the 10th EDF Country Strategy Paper and
National Indicative Program for 2008-2013. With a total allocation of €110 million for
programmable resources and €12.9 million for emergency assistance, the EU is the most
important grant donor in Jamaica. The country strategy aims to assist Jamaica in its
macroeconomic reform program as presented in the government’s Medium Term Framework
and to support the Government in reducing crime and violence and supporting human rights. The
resources available under the program are allocated as follows: 55 percent for general budget
support, 30 percent for sector budget support; and 15 percent for national capacity building.
Apart from EDF funding, other instruments of EU involvement in Jamaica include projects by
the European Investment Bank (EIB), activities financed under the Regional Indicative
Programme (RIP) for the Caribbean, and the Banana Support Programme.

7.      USAID: The USAID program of assistance to Jamaica is rooted in the 2010-2014
Country Assistance Strategy, which focuses on social and economic issues that contribute most
directly to crime and violence. Under the CAS, programs in Jamaica are organized around four
priority goals: reducing crime and corruption through efforts in law enforcement restructuring
and reform, promoting economic development by supporting trade, investment, and agricultural
competitiveness, investing in human capital by improving quality and equity of primary and
secondary education, and HIV/AIDS prevention.



                                                80
8.      DFID: The DFID and the World Bank are cooperating on restructuring the debt
management unit into front, middle and back offices in line with international best practice.
These efforts, together with programs to improve Parliamentary financial oversight and the
Government’s communication strategy, are financed by a £920,000 Bank-executed trust fund
provided by the DFID. The DFID’s involvement in Jamaica is conducted under the DFID
Caribbean regional umbrella, with annual spending of ₤13 million in 2010/11. In Jamaica, the
DFID program is focused on strengthening security, justice and anticorruption efforts. Active
programs include the Commonwealth Debt Initiative (CDI), which has benefitted Jamaica since
1998, police reform and police capacity building, the Jamaicans for Justice initiative,
Community Security Initiative (a two year, ₤1 million program), and rehabilitation of Jamaican
offenders. Another important activity over the last five years has been the Jamaica Social Policy
Evaluation (JASPEV) project, which supports the government’s strategic plan for a more
effective social sector delivery system by the year 2015.

9.      UNDP: UNDP activities in Jamaica are based on the 2007-2011 Country Programme
Action Plan. The Action Plan identifies three thematic areas as the focus of the UNDP program:
poverty reduction through improved economic planning, debt management, tax reform, and more
efficient public spending; crisis management through conflict prevention, justice and security
sector reform, and disaster risk management; energy and environmental security.

10.     CIDA: CIDA’s development assistance program focuses on three main areas: improving
governance, strengthening the private sector, and improving environmental management.
Through Canadian Partnership Branch, CIDA co-finances projects in Jamaica by Canadian non-
governmental organizations and institutions working in areas such as cooperatives, education,
family planning, youth and community development. Since 1989, CIDA's Industrial Cooperation
Program has financed 24 initiatives by Canadian businesses seeking to develop partnerships with
Jamaican companies. CIDA’s priorities include strengthening of key central agencies responsible
for the environment and supporting HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs.

11.     CDB: Since assuming office in 2007, the Government has benefitted from over US$200
million in CDB loans, which have supported educational and community development projects,
agricultural support, and natural disaster recovery. In April 2010, the CDB disbursed a second
tranche (US$33.3 million) of its US$100 million policy-based loan to the Government.
Furthermore, citizens, especially from rural areas, have been beneficiaries of the CDB’s
Caribbean Technology Consultancy Service (CTCS), a program that supports the development of
small businesses throughout the region.

 ANNEX 7: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS

1.     This annex presents the public debt sustainability analysis for Jamaica using both
deterministic and stochastic simulations and the susceptibility of public debt to GDP ratio
to various shocks. The baseline public debt to GDP ratio projections are based on the
macroeconomic assumptions that are consistent with the medium term macroeconomic
framework envisaged in Table 1.

2.     At the end of FY2010/11 the public, publicly guaranteed, and PetroCaribe debt
stood at 139.4 percent of GDP, including 20.3 percent of GDP in guaranteed debt not owed
by the central government. Of the central government debt, a little over half was held in
external debt, with the remainder held as domestic debt. This domestic debt was predominantly
denominated in Jamaican dollars, although 13.4 percent was denominated in US dollars (Figure
6). Overall, 76 percent of central government debt was denominated in foreign currencies. The
maturity profile of external debt indicates that almost half of external outstanding loans mature in
10 years or more compared to roughly a quarter of domestic debt loans. Half of domestic debt
loans mature within 5 years, with 6 percent maturing this fiscal year (Figure 7).

3.     Public debt has averaged more than 100 percent of GDP since 1990 and has
constrained public non-interest expenditure, but the Government is determined to lower
debt levels through the fiscal consolidation reform program. Since FY2007/08 the public,
publicly guaranteed, and PetroCaribe debt has risen rapidly from 114.2 percent to 139.9 percent
of GDP in FY2009/10, spurring the Government to enact various reforms to increase the overall
public sector balance over the medium term. These reforms include: (i) the rationalization of
several loss making public bodies; (ii) improving the efficiency of tax collection; (iii) the
implementation of a Fiscal Responsibility Framework; and (iv) a debt exchange conducted in
early 2010 which lowered interest rates and extended maturities on domestic debt.

4.     The assumptions underlying the baseline scenario postulate the successful
implementation of the Government reform program. Primary expenditure moderation and tax
reform are expected to improve the primary surplus from 5.0 percent of GDP in FY2011/12 to
7.3 percent of GDP by FY2016/17. After three years of negative real GDP growth, growth for
FY2011/12 is anticipated at 1.8 percent. The GDP growth is expected to steadily rise to 2.9
percent annually by FY2013/14 and remain at this level for the remainder of the projection
period, as the improved macroeconomic stability and reduced public sector borrowing would
support higher long run growth. Inflation is expected to fall gradually from an average of 7.4
percent in FY2011/12 to 4.6 percent in FY2016/17. Following the debt exchange the average
nominal interest rate on public debt is projected to be 11.1 percent in FY2011/12 and average 9.3
percent thereafter. Finally, the Jamaican/US dollar nominal exchange rate is expected to steadily
depreciate to 100.9 by the end of the projection period.

5.      Under the baseline scenario, the public, publicly guaranteed, and PetroCaribe debt
is estimated to fall gradually to 106.5 percent of GDP by FY2016/17, having reached a high
of 139.9 percent in FY2009/10 (Figure 8). Interest rate savings from the debt exchange, rising
primary balances, higher GDP growth and lower interest payments due to lower debt levels all
contribute positively to debt reduction, while falling domestic inflation rates and the net
Jamaican/US dollar exchange rate depreciation contribute negatively.

6.     Stochastic simulations indicate a high likelihood of downward debt dynamics under
the present reform program. Figure 8 shows the probabilistic debt projections reflecting the
uncertainties regarding the macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario.
Probability bands were constructed by assuming that the GDP, interest rate and inflation rate
forecasts are each normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to the standard deviation
in 2003-2010. The simulations indicate that, with an 80 percent probability, the public, publicly
guaranteed, and PetroCaribe debt will be between 90 and 120 percent of GDP by FY2016/17.

7.      The debt situation would have been dire had the debt exchange not been successful
and if the fiscal consolidation program was not implemented. Scenario A1 simulates this case
assuming low GDP growth at 1 percent annually, high real external and domestic real interest
rates at 5.2 and 7.5 percent respectively and no improvement in the 2010/11 primary surplus for
the entire projection period. Figure 9 shows that the public debt to GDP ratio would have been
on an explosive path under this scenario. The debt ratio could have been stabilized if the present
non interest fiscal consolidation had taken place (Scenario A2). These alternatives highlight the
importance of the debt exchange and the fiscal consolidation program in lowering public debt.

8.     The scenarios in Table 5 highlight the sensitivity of the debt dynamics to various
shocks. All shocks are concentrated in FY2011/12 and FY2012/13 or in the case of the 30
percent exchange rate depreciation in FY2011/12 only. It is important to note that the underlying
assumptions for later years remain unchanged from the baseline scenario and hence show a
strongly downward trend in the debt to GDP ratio in these years.

9.      Shocks to GDP, the primary balance or real interest rates could hamper progress
towards debt reduction. Individual shocks of a two standard deviation magnitude (measured by
the standard deviation over the 2003-10 period) would raise debt to GDP levels in FY2012/13
above the baseline by 9.5 percent for real GDP, 12.4 percent for the primary balance, and 13.5
percent for real interest rates (Figure 10). A combination all three of these shocks (scenario B5),
but at a reduced magnitude of one standard deviation, would raise the public, publicly
guaranteed, and PetroCaribe debt-to-GDP ratio by 23.4 percentage points over the baseline.

10.    The high ratio of foreign currency denominated debt in total debt exposes the
vulnerability of debt to exchange rate movements. Scenario B4 displays the debt dynamics in
the event of a 30 percent nominal deprecation of the exchange rate in FY2011/12 (Figure 11).
The debt levels would rise 17 percent of GDP above that of the baseline scenario in that year. If
additionally this depreciation occurs together with the one standard deviation shocks of
combination scenario (B5), then the debt to GDP level would rise to as high as 168 percent.

              ANNEX 8: REVIEW OF JAMAICA’S PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM

Policy and Strategy

1.      Jamaica’s Privatization Program is governed by Ministry Paper #34 of 1991 which sets
forth policies and procedures for privatization.19 Most countries have adopted a privatization law
and supporting privatization regulations at the beginning of their program. The law and
regulations are generally supported by an annual or multi-year program that details the
enterprises/ assets to be privatized during that period. However, it does not appear necessary that
Jamaica change at this point. Its program is mature and operates well with the present Policy and
Procedures Paper# 34. The present paper #34 and the revised policy paper and procedures
manual conform to good practice.

Institutional Capacity

2.      There is a complex, though quite interesting institutional structure managing the
implementation of the privatization program. First, the process is initiated and closely guided by
the PM’s office/ Cabinet. The Chair and the members of the Enterprise Team (ET) are selected
by the PM’s office and approved by cabinet. The ETs are generally a mix of private and public
sector appointees including a representative of the portfolio ministry, the Ministry of Finance,
DBJ, a board member of the enterprise to be privatized and the Chair, the latter is independent of
the enterprise and normally from the private sector. We interviewed three of the ET Chairs. Each
is a very experienced businessman (insurance company chairman, banker or lawyer), near or at
retirement, and highly respected. Each indicated that they had been directly appointed by the PM
and reported directly to the PM. The chair and the members of the ETs work without
compensation. Since privatization is invariably a highly political process, the PM’s office
appears to be carefully guiding the process. The ETs represent an interesting innovation by the
GOJ, dating back to the early phases of the Jamaican program. The Government has effectively
contracted out the privatization process to the private sector, and at present with the support of
the PM’s office, has reduced the ability of line ministries to stall or even derail the process which
has often occurred in decentralized privatization processes in other countries.

3.      In addition to the ETs, the Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) serves as the Secretariat
for Privatization, a technical resource to: (i) guide the process and retain external professional
support such as financial advisors, accountants and auditors, lawyers and other technical experts,
as necessary; (ii) to assist in drafting necessary supporting documents such as the information
memorandum; and (iii) in guiding visits by potential investors to the enterprise for due diligence
purposes and maintaining the data room (now in electronic form).

Privatization Procedures and Process

4.      To date, the GOJ has privatized all of its properties on a case by case basis and generally


19
   The GoJ draft policy and procedures paper, Government of Jamaica, Policy Framework and Procedures Manual
for the Privatisation Of Government Assets, December, 2010, once approved by Cabinet, will replace Ministry Paper
# 34 of 1991. The strategy is part of a broader Government initiative to decide what is the proper role of government
in Jamaica, what essential services it should provide, what it should own and operate and what is should divest.


                                                        87
by competitive tender. As smaller properties are privatized, the Government might want to
consider auctions; they are faster, less expensive and generally produce highly competitive
results, if the process is handled correctly. The Jamaican tender process appears to be in line with
good practice:

        After the Cabinet approves a company/ assets for divestiture an ET is established, a
         Chairman is selected by the PM/ Cabinet and professional firms are hired to assist in the
         internal due diligence process to prepare the company for sale;
        The office of Contractor General (CG) maintains an oversight role on all privatization
         transactions in an expanded view of its mandate. We were told by several parties, that
         the CG will investigate the transaction if there is any hint of impropriety;
        A bid announcement is prepared and circulated widely in international press and Jamaica;
        A long list of interested firms is evaluated and after due diligence by the DBJ and
         reviewed by the ET; a short list of qualified buyers is then produced with the concurrence
         of the ET;
        Qualified buyers can acquire the bid package at a pre-set price and have a period of time
         to do due diligence on the assets/ company for sale;
        Bids are sealed and submitted to the ET and evaluated against pre-defined scoring
         criteria. Bids are open at a preannounced place and time, as an open process. The DBJ
         guides this process;
        The selected bidder is reviewed and approved by the portfolio ministry, PM and Cabinet
         and authorization is given to the ET to negotiate;
        The ET invites the selected bidder to negotiate. If preliminary negotiations are successful
         and Heads of Agreement (Letter of Intent laying out terms and agreement in principle)
         reached, the ET will recommend the transaction through the Portfolio (line) Ministry to
         the PM and ultimately the Cabinet. The PM/ Cabinet may require changes in the
         transaction. If the negotiations fail the ET moves on to the next bidder;
        The ET and external counsel negotiate the sales/ purchase agreement and other
         supporting documents required for the transaction and the deal will close, again subject to
         final review by the PM/ Cabinet and the Attorney General who reviews and approves all
         such agreements.

5.      This process—delineated above based on discussions with the Government—conforms
well to good practice and the draft Policy and Procedures document. All transactions have their
own dynamic and rarely follow such a straight path. Given the history of losses in three of the
four entities under privatization and the difficult shape the assets/companies were in, it is not
surprising that the privatization process has proven to be lengthy and difficult in each case,
Pegasus being the exception. We discuss three transactions below—Sugar Estates, Air Jamaica
and Pegasus.

Specific Transactions Reviewed

6.       Sugar estates. The privatization of six sugars estates and five factories took place in


                                                 88
three phases. The objective of the GOJ was to ensure the viability of the industry and to ensure
that these specific estates received necessary investments and were modernized. The process was
incentivized by EU financial support for transformation of the industry. With sugar subsidies
from the European Union (EU) winding down, the state owned sugar estates were operating at a
loss. The EU offered the GOJ transformation (restructuring) financing of 89 million Euros,
conditioned on divestment of the estates.

7.      Following the divestiture of the first three estates in June 2009, the Cabinet at its meeting
of 29 March 2010 approved the divestment of three remaining estates. The Sugar Divestment
Team (SDT) evaluated the bids and Complant International Sugar Company of China was
selected as the successful bidder to acquire the estates at the Frome, Monymusk, and Bernard
Lodge Sugar Estates. The SDT made the recommendation to Cabinet to approve the sale through
the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Cabinet approved via Cabinet decision No. 26/10 on
12 July 2010. Negotiations with Complant began soon thereafter. This resulted in a signed
agreement on 30 July 2010. A first deposit for $473,020 was received on 23 August 2010.

8.      The total purchase price for the buildings and equipment was US$9 million. It is
anticipated that Complant will invest up to US$50 million to modernize the factories. The
transaction is intended to close fully in August 2011. SCJ, the sugar holding company, is
handling the planting, harvesting and refining of the sugar for Complant in its initial season as
owner on a cost plus 5 percent margin basis. SCJ had signed forward contracts with Tate & Lyle
to export sugar to the EU. It is our understanding that Complant is responsible for absorbing
operating results of the estates as of date of signing the agreement (30 July 2010).20

9.       Our conclusions on the sugar estates privatizations are: (i) that the initial process
resulting in a sale in 2009 of three of the estates to two different bidders was somewhat messy or
untidy. It is very unusual to re-open the bid period three different times and to negotiate with a
sole bidder for such an extended period of time; (ii) at the end of the day the process for the sale
of the first three estates was competitive resulting in several bidders; (iii) the second sale
attracted a long list of interested bidders and this resulted in several qualified bidders and in
divesting the remaining three estates relatively quickly; (iii) EU transformation support of some
89 million Euros provided strong incentives for the transaction to move forward; (iv) the
Administration was resolved to divest properties that were consuming fiscal resources; and, (v)
the process appears to comply well with the Governments policies and procedures, despite the
initial delays.

10.     Air Jamaica (AJ). The country’s flag carrier has been on a list of state-owned firms to
be privatized for some time. Over the last few years Air Jamaica was operating at a substantial
loss. The A J privatization was housed in the Ministry of Finance as the line ministry. The ET
chair was directly appointed by the PM, and is the Chairman of one of Jamaica’s largest
insurance companies. IFC acted as the sell-side advisor to the Government.

11.   The divestment agreement to Caribbean Air (CA) includes the following: (i) assumption
by CA of operating responsibilities for JA, including all operating losses, if any, as of June 2010;

                                                 89
(ii) the GOJ remains with AJ’s liabilities, primarily consisting of airline leases to be unwound.;
(iii) GOJ to own a 16.5 percent stake in CA as of the closing; (iv) All JA personnel were made
redundant as of June 2010, but some 2/3 of these staff were hired by CA; (v) JA retained some
assets, primarily land and buildings, including a headquarters building in downtown Kingston.
CA is leasing some of these facilities back from JA; (vi) JA will operate as a division of CA and
will retain its status as a flag carrier retaining landing rights and routes in North America; (vii)
due to the change in Administrations in Trinidad Tobago, the Government of Trinidad insisted
on an option to put the deal back to Jamaica within one year of assuming operating responsibility
for the airline, June 2011. The Chair of the ET indicated that there was little chance of that
happening. AJ apparently will add some 68 percent additional revenues to CA and some valuable
routes. In fact, while the mission was in Jamaica CA held a launch event to promote its deal with
JA; and, (viii) subject to finalizing legal agreements and the completion of a US$49.2 million
working capital injection into JA by the Government of Trinidad (the Chairman of the ET
estimated that some $30 million had already been injected), the transaction is expected to close
within the next month. The completion means that the US DOT will approve CA to fly from
Jamaica to the US (permission already received from Canada) and the shareholder and license
agreements will be signed, and the GoJ will at that time get 16 percent of CA. The ET confirmed
that there is no put option in the contract. However, there are certain covenants to be performed
under the contract by all parties, e.g. the GoJ must use best efforts to ensure that CA gets
permission to fly the routes to North America from Jamaica.

12.      Our conclusions on the JA transaction are that: (i) it was a fiscally important though
politically brave decision for the GOJ to make; (ii) the transaction appears to have been
conducted transparently and in line with Government policy and procedures; (iii) given the
losses, the Government was pragmatic and simply cut the best deal it could; (iv) the PM chose a
very experienced businessman to drive the transaction for the Government and he seems to have
done a very good job; and, (v) this transaction, while nominally under the Ministry of Finance,
seems to have been closely controlled by the PM and his chosen advisor.

13.    Pegasus Hotels of Jamaica Limited (PHJL).21 The sale of the Pegasus Hotel was
derived from the GOJ’s decision to have the Urban Development Corporation (UDC) revert to its
core mandate of economic development and to divest its mature properties including several
hotel and tourism properties. A UDC Enterprise Team was established to oversee the sale with
DBJ acting as the Secretariat for the process. In addition, Scotia DBG Investments Ltd. (Scotia
DBG) was hired as the financial advisor/ broker for the sale.

14.     The divestment process was consistent with the GOJ’s process. The UDC ET and the
advisor to the transaction reviewed the bid submission and decided to accept the bid of US$11
million on 27 July, 2010, for the 59.91 percent of the shares held by NHPL in PHJL. The
advisor/ lead broker Scotia DBG and legal counsel provided advisory support to the transaction
to ensure that the transaction was in compliance with Jamaica Stock Exchange rules. The Office
of the Contractor general reviewed the process and advised by letter of 18 August 2010 that the

process was in conformity with acceptable processes. The Purchase/ Sales Agreement was
signed on 14 September 2010 after Cabinet approval in September.

15.     Our conclusions on the Pegasus Hotel transaction are: (i) it emerged from a decision by
Government to have UDC divest mature properties and return to its core business; (ii) that the
process was transparent and carried out according to Government policies and procedures; (iii)
there was an advisor and legal counsel in place to guide the UDC ET and ensure that the
transaction was in conformity with stock exchange rules; and, (iv) the process remains open to
allow minority shareholders in this public company to exit on the same terms and conditions as
the Government.

 ANNEX 9: POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF FISCAL REFORMS IN JAMAICA

Introduction

1.      This Annex summarizes the main results of the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis
(PSIA) study of the reforms supported by the World Bank under the Programmatic Fiscal
Sustainability DPL series. The PSIA focuses on two reform actions likely to have the most
significant distributional impacts: tax reform and rationalization of public bodies. These focus
areas have been identified through consultations between the Government of Jamaica and the
World Bank. This PSIA identifies the particular channels through which the above reforms are
likely to affect the various segments of the Jamaican society and explores the extent of the likely
impacts.

Tax reform

2.     In order to analyze the distributional impacts of tax reform, this section develops a
recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model as well as the micro-
accounting module used to translate the CGE results into poverty and inequality outcomes.
The CGE analysis is carried out by contrasting a baseline simulation with a set of alternative
scenarios for the years 2007-2020. The results of these simulations are subsequently mapped to
the 2007 household survey (Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions) to explore the potential
impacts of changes in the macroeconomic and sectoral variables on household welfare, poverty,
and the distribution of income.

3.       The simulation incorporates the major tax changes in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 as
well as the Jamaica debt exchange (JDX) in February 2010. The first scenario (tax reform)
includes the largest measures (in terms of expected revenue impacts) from the series of tax
amendments implemented by the Jamaican authorities in FY2009-2010, such as the increase of
the special consumption tax (SCT) rate on petroleum and petroleum products (from J$7.36 to
J$16.11 per liter of unleaded gasoline ) and the subsequent re-introduction of the ad-valorem
component of the SCT on petroleum, as well as the increase in the general consumption tax
(GCT) rate. The second scenario (JDX + tax reform) also takes into account the decrease in the
rate of interest paid on domestic and foreign debt after the JDX.

4.      Although shifts towards indirect taxation are usually regressive—because poor
people consume a larger portion of their income—the incidence of the petrol tax is actually
progressive. Even though the petrol tax increase is welfare-enhancing on average, its
implementation could have adverse distributional effects if poorer parts of the population
consume more gasoline (relative to their total spending) than the richer segments. This is
normally why consumption taxes are considered regressive, as they affect a greater share of a
poor person’s income than a rich person’s income. However, in the case of Jamaica raising
gasoline taxes is unlikely to widen welfare disparities because the consumption of gasoline (as a
share of total consumption spending) is an increasing function of household welfare (Figure 12).
For any household, gasoline consumption is a small share of total household budget; however, a
poor household normally spends approximately 3 percent of its total expenditure on gasoline
while the same share for a non-poor household is 4.7 percent. Therefore, the increase in the
petrol tax imposes a higher burden (in relative terms) on the rich households than on the poor.

5.      On the other hand, the incidence of a reduction of interest payments on domestic
debt is quite progressive. There is no information in the JSLC or other readily available data
sources on the distribution of interest income from government bonds in Jamaica. However, the
JSLC does contain a question on dividend, interest, and rental income, and this information has
been used to allocate the bond interest receipts across the three representative household groups
in the CGE model. The data indicate that households with skilled primary earners receive
approximately 84 percent of all dividend, interest, and rental income in Jamaica, while
households with unskilled primary earners in urban occupations receive another 15 percent.
Therefore, the distribution of interest income is heavily biased towards richer skilled households,
and the poorest households—those with unskilled primary earners in rural occupations—receive
less than 1 percent of total interest income. As a result, a reduction in interest earnings due to the
JDX would affect rich households much more than poor households.

6.     The micro model results show that the reform scenario leads to additional poverty
reduction and lower inequality, although the differences with respect to the no-reform
scenario are quite small. The third and fourth columns of Table 6 show that, while poverty
could rise somewhat under tax reform alone, it would fall by 0.3 percentage points in the tax
reform + JDX scenario, while the Gini coefficient could also decline by a 0.3 points. Although
these differences are very small, there are several reasons why one may not expect to observe a
big boost in poverty reduction in this scenario. First, as mentioned earlier, consumption per
capita does not increase in this scenario relative to no-reform, which means that poverty
reduction can come only from distributional change. Second, although some distributional
changes are pro-poor—as discussed earlier, the increase in the petrol tax and the reduction in
bond coupon payments affect rich households more than the poor ones—other changes are
biased against the poorest households. These include the overall increase in the GCT rate, which
hurts poor households who spend all of their income on consumption, and the large increase in
demand for investment goods, which do not require rural factors in the production process. As a


                                                           93
result, the wages of unskilled rural households decline relative to the labor earnings of unskilled
urban and skilled households. On balance, the pro-poor distributional changes outweigh the anti-
poor ones, but the overall distributional change—and hence poverty reduction—is not
particularly large.

Public bodies rationalization

7.      This section focuses on the privatization of Government assets in sugar and mining
as part of the broader public bodies rationalization program supported by FSDPL2 in
sugar, mining, hotels, and air transport. The entities currently under privatization include Air
Jamaica, six publicly-owned sugar estates (St. Thomas Sugar Factory at Duckenfield, Long Pond
and Hampden in Trelawny, Monymusk in Clarendon, Frome in Westmoreland, and Bernard
Lodge in St. Catherine), Clarendon Alumina Partners (CAP), and Pegasus Hotels. Air Jamaica
became part of Caribbean Airlines in May 2010. The first three estates were sold in June 2009,
while the sale agreement for the last three was signed in July 2010. The Sugar Company of
Jamaica Limited is now a legacy company that was slated for closure in December 2010. CAP
operations have been taken over by a Swiss trading and mining group in January 2011, while a
sale agreement for Pegasus was reached in September 2010. In order to focus on sectors which
employ more people and are likely to have larger distributional effects, this PSIA examines more
carefully the experiences of the sugar privatization as well as the likely effects of the
privatization of bauxite and alumina production.

Quantitative results

8.      This section uses the 2007 Jamaican Living Conditions Survey (JLCS) to identify
the households with incomes linked to the public bodies subject to privatization. The
objective of this exercise is twofold. First, get an order of magnitude of the privatization reform
in terms of the number of households and individuals it could affect. Secondly, it compares
characteristics between households who depend on a sector subject to be privatized and the rest
of the population. Given the difficulty to identify in JLCS at the 4-digit level of disaggregation
the public bodies to be privatized, when identifying the households that are part of the sector to
be privatized, the exercise considers only three sectors: sugar, aluminum and ethanol.


                                                 94
9.      The reform is likely to directly affect few Jamaican households. Figure 13 shows that,
of the total population of 2,675,800 in Jamaica in 2007, 95,406 (3.5 percent) live in a household
whose head was working in an industry where privatization is taking place. But the great
majority of these Jamaicans, 89,780, were already part of the private sector and only 5,626 lived
in a household whose head worked in a public body to be privatized (households at risk). In other
words, the privatization reform could affect the livelihood of, as many as 5,626 Jamaican citizens
(0.2 percent of the total population) living in 2,274 households with a direct link to the public
bodies subject to privatization.

10.     Households with a direct link to a public body to be privatized are significantly
poorer than the rest of the population. These households have a level of consumption per
capita 30 percent lower than other households and a higher incidence of poverty (Table 7). The
big difference in poverty incidence among households with a link to a sector to be privatized and
other households is corroborated by the proportion of beneficiaries of PATH, a social assistance
program targeting the poor. As expected, household heads of the poorer vulnerable households
are less educated than non-vulnerable households, however, surprisingly, there are more female
heads of households among the non-vulnerable population subgroup.

11.     One of the most important linkages between the privatization reform and household
welfare is via employment. To evaluate the potential employment effects of the public bodies
rationalization program, this section analyzes the probability of transition to employment from
unemployment, and vice versa, in the very short run (after one quarter) and in the medium run
(after one year). Figure 14 presents the proportion of the employed (left axis) and unemployed
population (right axis) that transit to unemployment and employment, respectively, over time.
More than half of the unemployed population manages to find a job after one year while during
the same length of time, less than 4 percent of the employed population loses their job. After one
year in employment, the probability of job separation starts declining.

12.     In order to allow for multiple factors to affect the probability of transitioning in and
out of employment simultaneously, this section estimates a “mover-stayer? model. The
analysis therefore identifies the variables affecting the probability of losing and finding a job,
respectively. In order to test if the effects affecting the probability of transition are different after
one quarter versus one year, separate estimations are undertaken for the short- and medium-run,
respectively. The transition functions are estimated using a standard probit model, accounting for
survey weights and using robust standard errors.22 The results of estimating this model are shown
in Table 8, where the coefficients should be interpreted as the change in the probability of
observing an outcome (i.e., marginal effects).

13.    Workers with above-average years of schooling are less likely to lose their jobs and
have an easier time finding a job once unemployed. At very low levels of education, the
probability of losing a job increases slightly with additional years of schooling (both in the short
and the medium run). However, for workers with 5 or more (4 for the medium-run) years of
formal education, an additional year of schooling reduces their probability of losing a job.

14.     Although public sector workers face a lower probability of losing a job, they also
find it much more difficult to gain new employment once unemployed. Public sector workers
have much more job security, but once they lose their job, the probability of finding a new one is
6.98 percentage points lower than individuals who previously worked in the private sector. This
result suggests that workers in the public sector have a particular set of skills that are not
fungible enough to allow them to transit in and out of unemployment easily.


                                                     97
15.     Taking all factors into consideration, public sector workers in industries under
privatization are about 25 percent more likely to lose their job than workers in other
industries. On the one hand, as mentioned above, public sector workers in general have a lower
probability of losing a job. On the other hand, working in industries where privatization is taking
place is positively associated with a higher risk of losing a job. Moreover, individual
characteristics (such as education and experience) also vary across industries and sectors. In
order to calculate the overall impact, a probability of losing a job was calculated for all active
workers in the sample using the estimated coefficients from Table 8. The results show that public
workers in the sugar and aluminum industries have an average predicted probability of losing
their job of 4.6 percent compared with 3.7 percent for workers in other industries.

16.     Receiving special training, either by the employer or via the government training
programs such as HEART or NTA, makes a big difference. In the short-run, workers who
received specialized training have a lower probability of getting a job, perhaps motivated by a
higher reservation wage. However, after one year, those who received special training have a
probability of getting a job more than 6 percentage points higher than those who did not get
specialized training.

Qualitative results

17.    This section summarizes the findings of a series of participatory (community based)
and life history (individual/household based) interviews in the sugar privatized areas of
Trelawny and Bernard Lodge, Inswood. The interviews took place in December 2010, one
year after the privatization process, and some further follow-up interviews were conducted in
June 2011. Although only two communities were interviewed, the effects are similar enough to
be summarized together in Figure 15.

18.     Of particular note, and overwhelming ‘feel’ from communities, was one of optimism
for the future. There was genuine ‘hope’ that the privatization the local sugar factory would
result in a more prosperous future, however the underlying premise for such hope lay in ‘re-
recruitment’ or ‘retention’ - if still employed at the sugar factories. Overall therefore, generally,
divestment was thought to be a good thing that would result in investment into the factories and
improved management practices. However, the reality is that these are short run effects, with the
long run effects of divesture effects yet to be felt.

19.   The interviews identified the following main issues facing the communities, all of
which have been accentuated in the post sugar privatization period:
      Unemployment/Employment Effect/Low Wage. All communities identified future job
       creation and skill training to be critical, with the broad recognition that the lack of work
       has had major ‘knock on’ (multiplier) effects for spending/employment within the local
       community; Community groups note that many people are now unable to purchase basic
       foods – this is particularly the case for single occupied, former sugar industry, households
       over the age of 60; It is widely stated the current sugar privatization (or at least
       system/information about the process) is in ‘Chaos’ – with suggestion that at least 50
       percent of those previously employed not having worked since (Bernard Lodge estimates
       suggested now only 500 of approximately 2500 previously employed). People now
       ‘hustle’ (i.e. sell juice/small crops – peppers/lime /other, become taxi drivers) to survive.


                                                 98
      Child School Attendance: In the worst affected areas parents state that they can only
       afford to send their children to school 2-3 days per week; “Sending children to school is
       no longer a priority?; there is a lot of ‘loitering’ as a result – higher school drop outs;
       higher teenage pregnancy and overall lower school attainment.
      Society Problems: Lack of jobs has resulted in an increases sex trade (both male and
       female prostitution); Negative impact on communities with higher levels of distress
       borrowing from families and neighbors – this appears to have reached breaking point in
       some instances as future income streams are looking less certain – ‘many people have
       borrowed against future STU payments’; Key family members have migrated - especially
       men who leave their families; Family breakdown and domestic violence has also resulted.
      Theft/Deaths: People in effected communities ‘live from day to day’ – and theft has
       increased; In Trelawny deaths increased immediately after privatization because of
       ‘gangs’ but has subsequently reduced - “…we have a few rapes now and then and a few
       murders but we don’t have any crime and violence…?.
      Lack of Proper Housing/Sanitation: In the Bernard Lodge area/estate owned land most
       houses are ‘shacks’, with houses made/’pieced together’ from wood/boards; Residents on
       such land do not pay electricity or water bills. Bernard Lodge had previously been
       approached to renovate such ‘shacks’ for people to live in but refused to re-invest in the
       hope that such buildings would fall down and the tenants would move out. Land tenure
       for residents is therefore very insecure which results in no long term security/few plans
       for any crop cultivation etc; Government schemes to develop housing have been “talked
       about? but communities stated that they did not receive any substantive information.

20.     There are a few major differences between what the communities anticipated effects
were and how what has resulted, at least in the relatively short period post privatization.
The effects of loss of jobs and/or less secure jobs (in the case of re-employment) is creating
stress on families and communities both indirectly and directly with: Extra lending demands on
friends and family – much of which appears to have reached a critical limit, however as yet (in
the short run) few/if any individuals have lost their house. Communities did refer to some
outward migration having occurred, however this seems to have followed on from an
exacerbation of coping mechanisms (i.e. selling of assets/borrowing from other
households/friends). Some Sugar Transformation Payments (STP) have been distributed, but
community members do not have a clear idea of eligibility and/or who has received these. A
number of persons are still waiting for STP while having already borrowed against them. The
first payment was made about one year ago, but many of the people who worked as contractors
did not get anything as they had no contract with Bernard Lodge. In many instances workers
were re-employed on short term contracts, were slightly above the J$475,000 wage threshold, or
were pensioners who had passed the pension age – all of whom were excluded from STP. In
other cases, potential recipients experienced difficulties in collecting payments due to
complicated procedures (which require opening one or more bank accounts) and being offered
in-kind payments (e.g., motorcycles) instead of cash.

21.     Coping mechanisms associated with re-training and migration appear to be less of
an option. This is particularly concerning given the above average age of agricultural workers.
With this category of workers coping mechanisms that follow the sale/reduction of assets tends
to be reduction of personal and household consumption – in several cases to less than 2 ‘full’
meals per day. In several cases elderly headed households who were formerly employed in the
sugar industry were resorted to stealing cane from fields as a source of gaining nutritionally
intake. The long term effects of these individuals are yet to be fully considered.

22.    In addition to community interviews to try and provide a further understanding of
the coping mechanisms adopted by individuals and families, life histories were undertaken.
Characteristics from the quantitative and community based discussion were used to inform the
design of a semi-structured life history interview. The adoption of life histories allowed for the
opportunity to provide comparative information about households as well as recording responses
to open-ended questions that arise during the course of interviews. The latter focused on critical
incidents, events and factors identified by households and information that households identified
as important but was not part of the questionnaire design.23 The perceived welfare of a redundant

   The life histories adopted a “best practice? approach drawing from the work of others, an extensive review of life
history literature, advice from life history experts, and experience of the research team. Specifically the life histories
traced an individual’s life from childhood to the present day, focusing on key events. In many instances the
interviewee also drew a timeline at the end of the interview to triangulate the details of the interview, clarify any

23.     The sugar worker was employed as a driver at the local sugar factory and re-
employed for 3 months, post privatization, but had no work since. He is still hopeful of
future employment and how the future will turn out and is ‘highly expectant’ of re-employment.
We can see that he perceives his welfare to be at the lowest in his entire life, at the present time,
this has been caused by a series of shocks. Firstly he was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 2006;
Secondly as he was ostracized from the community the bar that had produced many welfare
gains throughout the late 1990’s produced less income; Thirdly the effects of reduced bar income
from fewer people being employed, and spending ‘socially’, in the local community (post sugar
privatization) and his unemployment results in a further downward trajectory in welfare. As is
common with many households suffering ‘crises’, the sequence or serial shocks tends to result in
a permanent loss of welfare more than any single shock. Higher levels of young dependants in
the 1980s combined with a first redundancy also highlights the current concerns of many
families.

Conclusions

24.     Relatively few household will experience negative income or consumption shocks
associated with the fiscal measures under the Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL
series. The impact of the tax reform on poor households is limited due to excise taxes affecting
items which are by and large demanded in lesser proportion by less well-off households. Some
households could experience negative welfare shocks in the short term, but poverty reduction


inconsistencies and identify incidents or processes not captured in the previous discussion. At the end of the semi-
structured interview, which normally lasted between one to two and a half hours, the respondents were given an
opportunity to ask the interviewers questions.

and inequality are likely to decline over the medium- and long-term as the fiscal reforms bear
fruit in terms of faster and more inclusive growth. Similarly, some households could be
negatively affected by the loss of employment due to public bodies rationalization. Although
workers employed in sectors where privatization is taking place are already at a higher risk of
losing their jobs than workers in other sectors, the total number of potentially affected persons
represents just 0.2 percent of the Jamaican population. In addition, government programs—such
as Sugar Transformation Unit payments, the conditional cash transfer PATH, and training
opportunities through HEART/NTA—are available to mitigate the adverse impacts.
