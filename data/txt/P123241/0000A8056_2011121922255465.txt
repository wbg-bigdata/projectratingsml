                         1)      Enhancing fiscal and debt sustainability, by supporting reforms to increase control on public spending and debt generation, reduce debt service burden
                         and improve debt management, reduce financial vulnerabilities, and increase public spending effectiveness.
                         2)      Increasing the efficiency of financial management and budget processes, by supporting efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditure and
                         investment, and strengthen control of public finances and the effectiveness of government budgeting practices.
                         3)      Reducing distortions and enhancing the efficiency of the tax system, through reducing the use of fiscal incentives and increasing the uniformity of the
                         tax code, improving client services for tax payers, broadening the tax base, and simplifying tax payments.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government of Jamaica has made progress in achieving the objectives of its economic reform program, supported by the Second Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability DPL
                         (FSDPL2). The Parliament enacted two additional legislative amendments to strengthen the Fiscal Responsibility Framework (introduced in March 2010). The re-organization of the
                         Debt Management Branch (DMB) continues with the hiring of directors of the new Front and Back offices and the ongoing efforts to recruit Middle office personnel. The Parliamentary
                         Tax Committee began its review of a Green Paper on tax reform in September and the Government has held a series of consultations with business and professional organizations,
                         civic bodies, trade unions, academics, workers, and the general public. However, Parliamentary discussions of recently tabled legislation, including the Fiscal Responsibility
                         Framework Regulations (approved by the House in November) and the Public Debt Management Bill, have been postponed until after the December 29 general elections.
