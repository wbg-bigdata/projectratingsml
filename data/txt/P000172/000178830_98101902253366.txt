v                               TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
4
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$1 .5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a technical assistance project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Burundi (504a-BU) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on January 14, 1975. This was followed by an
economic memorandum (885a-BU) distributed on October 24, 1975. Country
data are provided in Annex I. Burundi is one of the 25 least developed
countries as defined by the United Nations.
3.        Burundi remains one of the poorest of the least developed countries,
with a per capita income estimated at $92 in 1974.  Over the past five years
GDP grew by no more than 2 percent annually in real terms. Of a population
of 3.5 million only 115,000 are in wage employment; the remainder depend
mainly on subsistence agriculture.  The agriculture labor force is largely
untrained, and the level of enrollment in formal education is one of the
lowest in Africa.
4.        The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector.  Food crops
account for over half of GDP and other crops, of which coffee remains by
far the most important, account for a further 10 percent. In 1974 coffee
production reached a record of about 28,000 tons, 35 percent higher than in
the preceding year. The large harvest combined with a markedly higher pro-
ducer price resulted in a 62 percent increase in farmer incomes derived from
coffee, with consequent multiplier effects felt in both industry and services.
5.        Burundi has become increasingly dependent on coffee for foreign
exchange earnings; its share in total exports rose from 79 percent in 1965
to 84 percent in 1974. Owing to external marketing and transport delays, a
quarter of the 1974 crop was exported only in early 1975.  The value of
imports on the other hand rose 36 percent in 1974, and, consequently, foreign
exchange reserves fell sharply. The trend was reversed during the first four
months of 1975 as delayed coffee payments were received, while at the same
time imports fell to a level nearly 40 percent below that of the second half
of 1974. By December, 1975 reserves stood at a level equivalent to eight
months of merchandise imports. Rising import prices, combined with increased
internal demand, caused a record 23 percent jump in the cost of living index
for low income urban families during the year ended March 1975.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance   I
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



-2-
6.        The level of investment has remained consistently low, averaging
only 8 percent of GDP over the last five years. Domestic savings have amounted
to only 5 percent of GDP over the same period, approximately equal to net
capital inflows. Close to half of total gross capital formation was financed
by external aid.
7.        Due to high coffee prices, government revenues in 1974 were 14
percent above the level attained in 1973, while current expenditures grew
at only 9 percent. Thus in 1974 the Government was able to finance a 70
percent increase in its investment budget.
8.        Burundi faces a formidable set of disadvantages:  excessive de-
pendence on a single export (coffee) for foreign exchange, long and ineffi-
cient transport links for external trade, rudimentary infrastructure and
a largely untrained labor force. In the past, civil strife has disrupted
development and diverted resources. Further, the terms of trade have
deteriorated 40 percent since 1970. There are, however, some encouraging
indications. Internal order has been restored and a new planning organiza-
tion created. Improvements are being made in financial administration, and
a number of promising agricultural projects are under preparation. Substan-
tial nickel deposits have been found and may be brought into production over
the next ten years.
9.        At present the Government lacks a coherent overall development
strategy. This is in part due to the low priority accorded planning in the
past. As a first step in addressing this problem, the Government has trans-
ferred responsibility for national planning to a new "Bureau Technique
d'Etudes" (BTE). To make the new planning organization more effective, a
substantial strengthening of its staffing is required. A strong planning
capability would enable the Government to take the lead in initiating new
projects and in coordinating external aid within the context of a well defined
development plan.
10.       The short term prospects for the economy have recently improved. Although
coffee production in 1975 fell considerably from the record level achieved in
1974, prices have risen sharply owing to frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees.
Coffee production is expected to recover in 1976. In the longer term, if
the Government focuses on development and strengthens its administration, it may
achieve slow growth instead of stagnation. If nickel mining proves feasible,
the prospects over the next ten years would be transformed. Although such a
development appears technically possible, the commercial viability of nickel
mining has yet to be proved.
11.       Disbursements of official development assistance amounted to
US$24.8 million in 1974. Belgium contributed about 26 percent, and UN agen-
cies, IDA and the European Development Fund another 42 percent. Technical
assistance accounted for about US$12 million, while the aid contribution to
public sector projects reached about US$11 million in addition to Dvoeram
aid of some US$2 million. In the 1970-74 period, total foreign capital
inflows amounted to about US$109 million, of which US$105 million were in



grant form. On December 31, 1974, Burundi's external medium and long-term
debt amounted to about US$8 million excluding undisbursed amounts. Of this
the Bank and IDA together hold 57 percent. Debt service averaged 2.9 percent
of export earnings during 1972/74, with the Bank Group receiving 41 percent
of service payments. By 1980 the Bank Group will probably continue to hold
a high proportion of debt and debt service if most other aid continues to be
given on grant terms. Notwithstanding the low debt service ratio, the country
is not able to finance any borrowing on commercial terms, as its absolute
capacity to service external debt is limited by the size and fluctuations
(due to dependence on coffee) of its export earnings. External aid should
finance a high proportion of total project costs, including a portior of
local expenditures, and should be on grant or near grant terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING OPERATIONS IN BURUNDI
12.       In 1957, the Bank lent US$4.8 million to the Belgian Trust Territory
of Ruanda-Urundi for the improvement of the Bujumbura-Muramvya road and the
expansion of the lake port of Bujumbura. The loan, guaranteed by Belgium,
was fully disbursed at independence in 1962 and is being repaid by Burundi
with Belgian assistance. The last payment is due in 1977.
13.       Since independence, five credits have been made to Burundi, total-
ing US$13.2 million. The first credit for US$1.1 million, was made in March
1966 for the rehabilitation and extension of Bujumbura's water supply system.
A credit of US$1.8 million was made in April, 1969 for the improvement of
coffee production by smallholders followed by a second credit of US$5.2
million approved in November, 1975. A credit of US$380,000, made in June
1970, helped finance the detailed engineering of the Bujumbura-Nyanza Lac
road and a highway maintenance study. This study led to the fourth credit,
of US$5 million, for a highway maintenance project signed in March 1974.
No Bank loans have been made since independence.
14.       The Water Supply Project (Credit 85-BU) was completed in March
1973. While the project did not meet all objectives, Bujumbura was pro-
vided with an ample and safe water supply.  Implementation of the first
Coffee Improvement Project (Credit 147-BU) was hampered by frequent delays
in the delivery of construction materials, the civil disturbances in 1972
and management problems. The first coffee washing station started operating
in 1973 and the remaining three only in 1975. The project is now virtually
completed. The second coffee project (Credit 593-BU) will provide 110,000
smallholder coffee farmers with instruction in better cultivation techniques
and with inputs such as fertilizers, insecticides, and tools. The project
will also expand the facilities for processing coffee. Since the project is
a continuation of the previous project, staff are mostly already in post and
a good start had been made. The Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 467-BU)
has commenced satisfactorily. The project consultants took up their duties in
Burundi at the end of 1974, orders have been placed for the maintenance equip-
ment and a survey of training needs has been completed. Annex II contains a
summary statement of IDA credits as of December 31, 1975 and notes on the execu-
tion of ongoing projects.



-4-
'145.     The future lending program will be aimed primarily at increasing
agricultural productivity, thereby improving the nutrition and living stand-
ards of the impoverished rural population. A project to support development
of the traditional fisheries sector has been appraised and is expected to be
presented in the current fiscal year. Consistent with the Government's emphasis
on rural development, a comprehensive reform of the education system has been
initiated. A basic education project in support of this reform has been
prepared with assistance from UNESCO and will be appraised shortly. We also
intend to continue assistance for expanding and improving the road network,
a prerequisite for rural development. Because Burundi lacks the administrative
capacity to plan and carry out development, we intend to make a special effort
to assist in improving planning, project preparation and project implementation.
In this respect, a special economic mission visited Burundi in April of this
year to advise on planning. Also, we will continue to include project manage-
ment and technical expertise in project lending.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
16.       Since independence, Burundi has been beset by internal struggles.
Outbreaks of civil strife, particularly in 1972, have disrupted the develop-
ment program and government efforts have been diverted to deal with the
security problem. However, internal order has now been restored and there
are encouraging indications that the Government is determined to seek national
reconciliation through sustained economic developments which will benefit the
mass of the population.
17.       Economic progress since independence has been slow.  The first Five
Year Plan was not published until 1971 and, as it covered the period 1968-72,
was of little practical use. The second Five Year Plan covers the period
1973-77; it was published only in mid-1975. It is in many respects incomplete.
Until a year ago planning was one of the many responsibilities of the Ministry
of External Affairs, Cooperation and Planning. The Department of Planning was
accorded relatively low status. The work of the miscellaneous groups of ex-
patriates has been poorly controlled; bilateral agencies have dealt directly
with individual ministries without there being effective coordination. The
ministries responsible for economic and social development have had almost no
planning capability of their own.
18.       The Government has recognized these weaknesses.  In September 1974,
as part of a ministerial reorganization, President Micombero transferred
responsibility for national planning to a new "Bureau Techniques d'Etudes"
(BTE) under the direction of a Secretary General, carrying the rank of a
minister. The Secretary General, Mr. D. Bihute, a former Executive Director
of the Bank, reports directly to the President. The BTE has also been made
responsible for the coordination of development financing (including external
aid), the collection of statistics and the supervision and implementation
of the development program.



19.       The effectiveness of the new arrangements will partly depend on
whether the BTE can secure adequate competent staff. Since there are no
experienced Barundi planners, the BTE is seeking substantial technical assist-
ance. The Government rightly intends to balance a strengthened central plan-
ning organization by an increased planning capacity in the ministries respon-
sible for implementing the development program. The development effort is
more likely to succeed if the initiatives for project identification and
preparation mostly originate in the executive ministries rather than in the
BTE.  To achieve full commitment to an investment program the ministries
directly concerned with project implementation must be intimately involved
in its conception and elaboration. Supervision of project implementation,
too, should be the responsibility primarily of the executive ministries.
Here again there is an urgent need for more qualified personnel which in the
immediate future can only be provided through external technical assistance
either in the form of consultancies or operational staff.
20.       All the aid agencies active in Burundi have experienced similar
problems in obtaining well formulated projects. There is no pipeline of well
prepared projects awaiting financing. A shortage of project proposals, properly
elaborated, is one of the reasons for the very low levels of investment achieved
in recent years. Now that the Government appears determined to concentrate
its efforts on development, the need for additional qualified staff is parti-
cularly urgent.
21.       Burundi entered independence with an acute shortage of trained
nationals. High priority has been given to the expansion of education, which
currently absorbs about 25 percent of the total ordinary budget. Neverthe-
less, only 22 percent of the relevant age group is enrolled in primary schools
and less than 2 percent in secondary schools. The total student enrollment
in all types of higher education rose from around 300 in 1967 to 750 in 1973.
However despite this rate of growth, there are less than a 1,000 post-secondary
school students. Since it has no means of financing a rapid expansion, the
Government is forced to concentrate on improving the efficiency of the educa-
tional system within the existing financial limitations. A major reform is
envisaged, aimed at making the education programs more directly relevant to
Burundi's needs. Primary education will be provided in Kirundi, with major
stress on practical basic education. At the secondary level the system will
be restructured to give greater emphasis to vocational training. Higher
education is to be consolidated in a restricted number of faculties within
the University of Burundi, limited to providing training to meet priority
needs.
22.       Despite the relatively high expenditure on education, the absolute
number of trained people being produced is small; it is totally insuffi-
cient to meet the economy's demand for high-level personnel. In any event,
since the period required to produce an experienced professional is consid-
erable, the efforts of the past few years will only begin to make a marked
impact on the supply of qualified Barundi in the early 1980s. Meanwhile,
if an effective development effort is to be mounted, it is essential that
Burundi should receive substantial external technical assistance to meet
the shortfall.



22.       External financing for technical assistance has risen steadily in
recent years. In 1974 total disbursements are estimated approximately at
US$12 million, US$7.6 million being provided under bilateral programs,
US$4 million by United Nations organizations and US$0.4 million by other
muitilateral agencies. There was a similar level of disbursements in 1975;
disbursements in 1976 are expected to be comparable. Although these are
relatively large sums, much of the funds is devoted to the manning of basic
services and ongoing programs, especially in the education, agriculture and
health sectors. Relatively few of the technical assistants are directly
employed on the preparation of new projects.  In 1974, there were some 600                   P
long-term expatriate technical assistants working in Burundi, divided between
the different sectors approximately in the following proportions:
Sector                        _%
Education                      54
Agriculture                    17
Health                          9
Other                          20
100
Those employed in education were mostly teachers who were by far the largest
single group. Most of the technical assistants employed in agriculture were
involved either in research or the implementation of specific investments.
When bilateral technical assistance is used for planning or project prepara-
tion, it is usually related to projects of specific interest to the indivi-
dual donor. The fact that bilateral aid is generally tied, with recruitment
being undertaken by the donor, tends to detract from its usefulness, since
the Burundi Government is left with little discretion in the choice of
personnel.
24.       The US$10 million UNDP program, covering the current indicative
planning period (1972-76), is fully allocated and indeed may have to be reduced
during 1976. Also fully committed are the additional US$2 million
provided to Burundi under the UNDP-administered special funds for the least
developed and most seriously affected countries. Proposals to commit funds
available in the next UNDP indicative planning period (1977-81) are under
consideration. However, it is already evident that a major portion of the
funds will be absorbed on ongoing projects. The bilateral technical assistance
programs for 1976 have mostly been negotiated and it has therefore been possible
to identify outstanding needs.
25.       It is intended to include in future IDA credits provision for
technical assistance for sector related matters. This has already been
done in the case of both the Highway Maintenance Project and the Second
Coffee Project. For example, under the Highway Maintenance Project provision
was made for the preparation of a master plan for road development. However,
it is considered essential that the Government should have access to addi-
tional discretionary and flexible resources for requirements which cannot
be met adequately by technical assistance available from existing bilateral
and multilateral sources.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Summary
26.       A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.  Negotiations
were held in Washington in January, 1976. The Burundi delegation was led by
Mr. D. Bihute, Secretary-General in the Office of the President. The project
would comprise:
(a) About 10 man-years of long-term advisory services to
strengthen planning, the statistical services and project
preparation in the development ministries and the BTE,
together with a limited amount of equipment and vehicles
to support their work; and
(b) About 150 man-months of short- and medium-term consultancies
to (i) undertake preinvestment and feasibility studies and
prepare projects for financing and (ii) conduct special studies
related to project or economic policy implementation.
It is intended that the Credit would be mostly committed during 1976 and that
the project would be completed within three years.
Long-Term Advisory Services
27.       The report of the special economic mission which visited Burundi
in April 1975 (855a-BU) identified an urgent need to strengthen planning and
project preparation through the recruitment of a small number of key personnel.
The report also placed emphasis on the need to establish the Government's
statistical services on a sound basis. The Government acknowledges the need
for technical assistance to strengthen its planning capacity and has approached
various bilateral agencies to recruit the required staff. However, it is
anticipated that these sources will not be able to fill some of the posts to
the satisfaction of the Government. The proposed Credit will be used in such
cases. In particular it is envisaged that the posts of senior economic adviser
and senior statistician in the Bureau Techniques d'Etudes should be recruited
under the project.
28.       A particular matter of concern to the Ministry of Economy and
Finance is the financial supervision of the expanding number of parastatal
organizations. It is important that they be operated on a sound financial
basis so that they do not become a drain on public funds which could otherwise
be used for investment. It is also important that better management procedures
be adopted. It is proposed to recruit a financial analyst who has had ex-
tensive commercial experience to advise the Minister in this matter. The ex-
pert, who would be provided under the project, would also scrutinize the
activities of companies in which the Government has an equity participation
in order to safeguard the interests of the State.



-8-
29.       The Government attaches high priority to the development of the
country's mineral resources, especially nickel, recently identified by a
United Nations exploration team. The Minister responsible requires expert
economic advice to evaluate the proposals being made by different private
investors and generally to assist in the preparation of mining projects.
The Department of Mines also needs strengthening; in particular it lacks the
capacity to analyze mineral samples. The Credit would be used to recruit a
irineral resources economist and a metallurgist.
30.       Further details of the advisory services to be financed under the
project are set out in Annex IV; however, it should be noted that the list
is not exhaustive. It is also proposed to finance from the credit a small
a-aount of equipment and materials to support the work of the advisers, such
as desk calculators and two or three vehicles for duty travel.
Short-term Consultancy Services
31.       If the Government is to raise the level of investment and promote
broad-based development, there is an urgent need to build up a pipeline of
projects suitable for external financing. While the Government's staff
assisted by long-term advisers can elaborate a national development plan,
the detailed preparation of investment proposals will call for expertise
which can best be provided by hiring consultants or specialists on a short-
term basis. It is envisaged that the Credit will be used mainly to finance
studies in the agricultural, industrial and mining sectors. Details of needs
b:or consultants which have already been identified are given in Annex V.
While it is expected that some of the studies will lead to projects suitable
for financing by the Association, studies in connection with projects to be
financed by other sources would not be excluded.
32.       In September 1975, a Bank agricultural project identification mis-
sion visited Burundi. As a result of discussions between the Government and
the mission, a rural development project to be based on the creation of agri-
cultural development centers has been tentatively identified. The main objec-
tive would be to increase crop and livestock production through a concentration
nf extension activities, supply of farm inputs and other services (animal
lusbandry, veterinary, health, etc.) on three or four pre-selected areas of
blgh agricultural potential. Two other projects involving livestock have
been identified, one by a FED team and the other by FAO. Both require detailed
preparation. The first is aimed at culling over-age animals and providing
related processing facilities. The second is a small scheme for a dairy herd
to supply milk to Bujumbura. In order for these projects to be prepared in a
relatively short time, the Government requires the assistance of consultants.
Also they give rise to a need for marketing studies for both meat and crops.
Ae,other aspect of rural development requiring further study is reafforestation.
Burundi's forest reserves are dwindling rapidly, causing great concern because
of both the resultant soil erosion and the growing shortage of timber and
firewood. A comprehensive national forestry survey is urgently required as
a basis for planning the reafforestation components of rural development
projects.



-9-
33.       Industrial development has been very slow in recent years.  To
remedy this, a small UNIDO team has been recruited and is currently preparing
feasibility studies of potential industrial projects with a view to interest-
ing investors in the private sector. Given the variety of aspects which must
be studied, the team needs to be supported by short-term consultants capable
of undertaking specific highly specialized studies. For example, the assis-
tance of a metallurgist and a production engineer is required for a study
of a plant for recycling scrap metal. Also a specialist in flour milling is
required to help prepare a project for a new flour mill which is under consi-
deration. It is expected that these studies will lead to viable industrial
projects to be financed by the National Development Bank, possibly with
assistance from the Association.
34.       Recent research undertaken by a UNDP mineral exploration team has
revealed the presence of a large nickel deposit. The Government requires
technical assistance both to undertake more detailed studies of the deposit
and also to assist in negotiations with potential investors. The UNDP is
expected to finance part of these requirements, but there will be a need for
additional technical assistance to be financed by the proposed Credit. The
exploration team is also pursuing other promising mineral prospects which
will almost certainly give rise to other commercial possibilities requiring
further investigation.
Training
35.       The Government is aware of the urgent need for training Barundi
staff in the fields of planning, statistics, and project preparation. An
important part of the training must be on-the-job, working as counterparts
to foreign experts. During the implementation of the project particular
care would be taken to ensure that suitable Barundi staff are assigned as
counterparts to assist the long-term advisers and the short-term consultants
(see Section 3.03(b) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). At the
same time the terms of reference of the advisers and consultants would
include a training aspect.
36.       The financing of scholarships is not included under the proposed
Credit as the existing bilateral and multilateral aid programs make ample
provision for training. For example, FED has recently made available US$4
million for scholarships of various kinds. It is envisaged that some- of the
more experienced planning staff will be nominated for appropriate EDI courses.
The major problem in the past has been to find suitable candidates for over-
seas training. With the expansion of higher education that has taken place
in recent years, an increasing number of young economists are now graduating.
This will enable the Government to accelerate training during the project
period. The shortage of trained statistical staff at all levels is parti-
cularly acute; in this regard, the National Institute for Administrative
Techniques is planning to mount specialized courses financed by the UNDP.



- 10 -
Project Management and Supporting Services
37,       Project execution would be coordinated by the Bureau Techniques
d'Etudes (BTE) (Section 3.05 (a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Individual experts or consultants would be under the supervision of either
the BTE or the relevant ministry. The BTE would formulate specific proposals
for technical assistance and would submit each proposal for the use of the
Credit to the Association for approval. Contracts with consultants or indi-
vidual experts would be prepared by the Government and would be subject to
the agreement of the Association   (Section 3.03 (a) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). The Association would assist the Government in the recruitment of
advisers and in the hiring of consultants. In the case of individual experts
the Government would be responsible for providing all necessary supporting
services, such as office accommodation, secretarial assistance and other
office expenses.
Cost and Financing
38.       The total project cost of US$1.8 million (net of taxes), of which
US$1.4 million or approximately 80 percent is expected to be foreign exchange,
s made up as follows:
US$ Thousand
Long-term advisers                  720
Consultants                         900
Equipment                            80
Unallocated                           70
1,770
It has been assumed that one expert-year will cost $60,000, and that one man-
month of consultancy will cost $6,000. The total project cost includes an
estimate of the cost of Government's support services (office accommodation,
secretarial assistance, salaries of counterparts, etc.), calculated at 20
percent of the total emoluments of the advisers. The proposed Credit of
US$1.5 million would finance 85 percent of total project costs.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       The selection of consultants would be in accordance with the
Association's normal procedures. Procurement of equipment and vehicles would
be in accordance with the Borrower's normal procedures which are considered
satisfactory. The Association will disburse 100 percent of the salaries and
.moluments of advisers; in respect of the consultancy services and equipment
and vehicles, the Association will disburse either 100 percent of foreign
expenditures or 85 percent of total expenditures.

Benefits and Risks
40.       The technical expertise to be provided under the proposed project
would help the Government in its efforts to formulate an effective and well
planned development program and to identify and prepare specific investment
projects. It would help strengthen the Government's planning machinery by
alleviating the critical shortage of experienced economists and statisticians.
The project does, however, have risks. Difficulties may be experienced in
recruiting suitably qualified experts and investment projects prepared by
consultants may not always lead to viable projects. To minimize these risks,
as explained above (para 37), the Association would help recruit suitable
advisers, and all contracts would be subject to the approval of the Association.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee referred
to in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the draft resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement
follows the form previously used for this type of project. Features of the
draft Development Credit Agreement of special interest are referred to in
paragraphs 35 and 37.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.  Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 467-BU         Highway Maintenance Project:  US$5.0 million of
March 27, 1974;
Effective Date: August 22, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The highway maintenance project is the first phase of a
long-term program to establish an efficient highway
V                                   maintenance organization.  The project consists of the
purchase of maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel and
construction materials, the construction of a workshop
and consultant services for technical assistance and
training, a study on the development of the road sector
and a feasibility study and detailed engineering of the
Ngozi-Muyinga-Kobero Road (106 km). The project is co-
financed by the UNDP (US$1.05 million), Germany (US$1.33
million) and Belgium (US$400,000). Execution of the
project is generally satisfactory. The consultants
responsible for technical assistance (financed by UNDP)
started their work in October 1974. Procurement of
equipment is underway to mechanize maintenance units
being established under the project. The construction
of a workshop in Bujumbura (financed by Germany) has been
completed. The road studies for which the Government is
negotiating a contract with consultants are expected to
start shortly.
Credit No. 593-BU         Second Coffee Improvement Project: US$5.2 million of
December 5, 1975:
Effective Date: estimated for March 31, 1976
Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The Credit is not yet effective, pending final agreement
with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development regar-
ding its participations in the project. However, since
the project is a continuation of the first Coffee Impro-
vement Project (US$1.8 million Credit No. 147 BU of
April 11, 1969), it is being implemented by the institu-
tions and staff responsible for the first project. As a
result the Project is staffed, with the exception of
-several new positions, and is proceeding satisfactorily.
_/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strength and weaknesses in
project execution.

ANNEX V
Page 1
SHORT TERI CONSULTANCIES
It is proposed that the funds allocated for short term consultancies
be used in part for the following studies. Other studies would be identified
during 1976.
(a) Agricultural Development Centers
Consultants are required to assist in the preparation of a rural
development project based on rural development centers. The objective of such
a nation-wide project would be to increase crop and livestock production through
a concentration of extension activities, supply of farm inputs and other services
(animal husbandry, veterinary, health, etc.) on pre-selected areas of high agri-
cultural potential. The proposed project would not only enhance rural develop-
ment and local agricultural production in and around the administrative centers
of some of the more promising areas of the country, but would also provide a
nucleus and framework for a future nation-wide integrated rural development
program. The Government proposes that the initial phase should be located in
Muyinga Province.
(b) Livestock Development and Meat Marketing
A recent study financed by FED has identified a number of measures
for promoting livestock production. In particular a project has been proposed
for the culling of over-age animals. Meat processing facilities would need to
be provided and suitable outlets found for the meat products. Consultants are
required to undertake detailed project preparation, including a comprehensive
study of the market for meat.
(c) Dairy Scheme
The Government proposes to establish a small dairy project in the
Ruzizi valley for the supply of milk to Bujumbura, based on a preliminary study
undertaken by an FAO expert. It is envisaged that the scheme smallholders would
grow fodder and foodcrops on irrigated land. The advice of a livestock expert
and an irrigation engineer are required to complete project preparation.
(d) Forestry Resource Survey
Burundi's forestry resources are being rapidly depleted as currently
utilization greatly exceeds reafforestation. If present trends continue the
fuel situation will become critical within 10 to 15 years. There is also a
serious problem of soil erosion. Before a national reafforestation proRram can
be prepared a nation wide survey of the forestrv resouirces should be underta1ren.
Consultants would be used for this task.



ANNEX V
Page 2
(e) Flour Mill
Preliminary investigations have indicated that here is scope for
the establishment of a small flour milling industry. Two alternatives have
been identified: (i) several small plants located in the areas of wheat
production or (ii) a larger central mill. The Government wishes to hire
consultants to undertake a detailed feasibility study which is expected to
lead to an investment proposal to be financed with assistance from the
National Development Bank.
(f)  Scrap Metal Plant
UNIDO consultants have advised that a scrap metal plant could be
established in Burundi as a viable industrial project. There is a considerable
accumulation of scrap metal, and some 3,000 tons of metal equipment is imported
annually. The recovery plant would include a breaker's yard, a foundry, a
forge and a manufacturing unit producing simple iron or steel tools and
equipment. The total investment would be approximately $1.5 million. The
next step is to undertake a detailed feasibility study.
