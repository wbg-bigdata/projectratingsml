MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$62.5 MILLION TO
ADMINISTRACION NACIONAL DE USINAS Y TRASMISIONES ELECTRICAS
TO BE GUARANTEED BY THE REPUBLICA ORIENTAL DEL URUGUAY
FOR A POWER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Electricas (UTE)for US$62.5
million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
term of 15 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate and would be guaranteed by the Republic of Uruguay.
2.       Background.  Uruguay was hard hit by the energy crisis of the 1970s.
To counteract its effects, investments were concentrated on the construction of
large hydroelectric projects; consequently, hydroelectricity now represents 75X
of the total installed generating capacity. In addition, adequate pricing for
oil derivatives was implemented. Because of this policy--plus additional
conservation efforts and substitution of wood and hydroelectricity for
fuel--the demand for oil products dropped significantly. In contrast,
electricity consumption rose close to 4.3% per year. Meanwhile, Uruguay's
power company, UTE, benefitted, with Bank help, from improvements in sector
organization through: (a) the removal of telecommunications from UTE's mandate
(in 1974); and (b) the enactment of an Electricity Law to regulate the
generation and distribution of electricity and provide e mechanism for setting
tariffs (in 1977).
3.       Although sector policies and actions continue to stress energy
conservation and maintenance of adequate pricing, the emphasis has turned to
the improvement of UTE's managerial capability and overall efficiency, in line
with Government efforts to reform the public enterprises.  UTE's accounting,
budgeting, commercial procedures, and administration need modernization, staff
is excessive, and power losses are high.  To ramedy this, UTE has entered into
a twinning agreement with a Spanish power utility to absorb its experience on
these subjects and begun to implement an Institutional Development Program
(IDP). Under the IDP, UTE is developing new management information systems and
implementing new procedures to begin addressing these needs. UTE is also
streamlining its organizational structure to make it more efficient. As
recommended by the Bank, UTE's new structure creates an environmental unit to
serve as the nucleus of greater capability in this field. Adequate and
suitably designed tariffs have enabled UTE to improve its financial performance
to a satisfactory level over the last three years. However, the tariff
adjustment arrangement lacked the necessary flexibility to accommodate
fluctuations in fuel expenses during very dry years (as occurred in 1989),
which resulted in lower UTE earnings. After discussion with the Bank, the
Government created a fuel surcharge to offset UTE's extra costs; this should be
maintained and adjusted periodically. UTE's collections of accounts receivable
have been satisfactory for private customers (which constitute 852 of UTE's
operating revenues); however, arrears of Government and public entities
correspond to the equivalent of one year's billing. The financial losses
caused by these arrears and the extra fuel expenses in 1989 obliged the Central
Bank to service a substantial part of UTE's external debt.



4.       OTE 'tuifers as well from several technical difficulties.  The high
perceat.<f (if hydroelectric generation in the Uruguayan system, although
allw:.i;:g substitution for imported fuel, has increased the risk of electricity
suppl dc-fticits during dry periods because the existing hydroplants do not have
er'ugii regulating storage capacity. Studies show that the Uruguayan system
faces a 32,. probability of having deficits that could result in curtailment of
up to 35i of the demand. The very dry year of 1989 confirmed these
predictions, requiring electricity cutbacks during the three months of peak
load. The thermoplant included in the proposed project would address this need
in the short term. In the long term, a study financed under Loan 1779-UR
recommended that future power generation be based on thermal plants since none
of the hydro projects that were identified could compete economically with
thermal plants given present and projected fuel prices. In this connection,
and to advance further its efforts to decrease dependence on imported fuel,
UTE is analyzing the possibility of using firewood in future power plants in an
ongoing feasibility study under a technical cooperation program with Sweden
which includes an environmental impact assessment. Also, while UTE has
operated and maintained its facilities adequately, the distribution system in
Montevideo is very old, its reliability is low, and losses are high.
Bank-financed studies have provided the basis for the investments necessary to
rehabilitate the distribution system. tITE's investment program for 1990-97 is
adequate and was designed to meet the forecast demand growth with acceptable
levels of reliability and at least cost.
S.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The proposed project is in harmony
with the targets of the Bank-supported structural adjustment program, which
places high priority on improving public sector efficiency. SAL II supports
the adjustments in macroeconomic policies and targets on global public sector
reforms included in the program. The proposed project would complement it by
aiming at specific efficiency improvement targets for the power sector. The
project forms an integral part of Uruguay's power sector strategy and overall
public investment program supported by the Bank. IBRD involvement in the
project would help in: (a) ensuring that the institutional framework for
project implementation is sound; (b) serving as a catalyst for the
participation of other donors through cofinancing; and (c) strengthening the
sector policies and procedures on environmental safeguards in the construction
and operation of power projects. Previous Bank loans to UTE have played a key
role in advancing necessary policy and institutional reforms designed to help
reduce Uruguay's dependence on imported fuel. UTE's performance under previous
projects has been satisfactory although its procurement procedures have
consistently delayed project implementation. Continued Bank involvement would
advance the reforms required to bring UTE's managerial and operational
capabilities to adequate levels of efficiency as part of the effort to contain
public sector expenditures. Also, during project preparation, procurement of
the major project component (thermal plant) was advanced, which has allowed UTE
to access cofinancing under very good terms and assure that procurement would
not cause project delays.
6.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project aims to ensure suitable
electricity service at least cost and to modernize UTE's management to improve
efficiency. Project objectives include: (a) improving the reliability of
meeting short to medium-term electricity demand by installing new thermal
generating units to help face droughts; and (b) improving sector efficiency by
improving UTE's managerial capability and reducing losses.

7.        Project Description.  The proposed project is part of UTE's
investment program for 1990-97 and would include: (a) installation of a new
thermal plant (powered by two gas turbines of 113.5 MW each), including spare
parts, control house, substation, interconnection to the existing transmission
system, fuel pipeline, and fuel tanks. This would reduce the high risk of
electricity deficiency the Uruguayan power system will face in the 1990s (492
of base cost); (b) improvements in the Montevideo power distribution network
consisting of rehabilitation of the medium and low voltage system to increase
the reliability of service to customers as well as reduce the actual level of
technical losses (20% of base cost); and (c) implementatiotn of an Institutional
Development Program (IDP) consisting of: (i) technical assistance for
developing adequate procedures, management training, and transfer of software
and computational systems through a corporate twinning contractual arrangement
that would emphasize improved commercial and operational practices, increased
labor productivity, and the improvement of administrative systems required to
support the above, such as, personnel, procurement, inventories, and
information systems; (ii) purchasing and setting-up equipment to support the
above; and (iii) a training program including the rehabilitation of UTE's
training center for technicians and skilled workers (31? of base cost).
8.       UTE would carry out the project through a structure headed by a
project coordinator and three project directors. The project coordinator and
the project directors would work within the framework ot UTE's organization
with the assistance of the procurement, construction, finances, and engineering
units. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$207.8 million
equivalent, including taxes and duties but excluding interest during
construction. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$157.9 million (76%).
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement plus the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. The Bank's proposed loan would cover 30% of total project
cost and 402 of foreign costs. Joint financing with Export-Import Bank of USA
(EXIMBANK) is proposed for the thermoplant. Due to the drought in 1989, UTE
requested the Bank to advance procurement of the thermoplant through ICB under
the Bank's guidelines but asked bidders to offer financing proposals as an
option. Bids were evaluated on a cash basis without taking into account the
offered credit terms. The lowest evaluated bidder presented a financing offer
from EXIMBANK (35X in the form of a grant and 65% in the form of a commercial
loan), which would finance the majority of the costs of the thermal plant. The
very competitive prices obtained and the excellent cofinancing of red were
enhanced by the Bank's proposed participation in the project. UTE's own
resources would provide 52% of the financing requirements.
9.       Agreed Actions. The Government and UTE have agreed on the following
actions: (a) implementation of an institutional development program (IDP),
covering improvement in commercial and administrative practices, increase in
personnel efficiency and reduction of inventories; (b) reduction of staff by
not replacing 50t of the annual attrition of UTE's employees; (c) creation of
an environmental unit within UTE which would carry out a work program for the
period 1991-95 satisfactory to the Bank; (d) tariff actions to ensure that
UTE's internal cash generation would never be lower than that required to
finance 40? of the total yearly investment including interest during
construction and variation of working capital and that UTE's ratio of working
expenses to operation revenues would not be superior to 50X in any year; (e)



assurance that Lhe 1989 fuel surcharge would be maintained and adjusted as
required to reflect realistically UTE's fuel cost; (f) actions to ensure that
UTE would collect bills issued, particularly from Government entities, within
75 days of the issuance; (g) establishment of a -learing house system for
monthly compensation and payment of owed balances among public entities: (h)
implementation of the rehabilitation of Montevideo distribution system and in
UTE's commercial area to reduce losses; and (i) assurance that UTE will discuss
with the Bank the results of the study on the possible use of firewood in
future power plants (including its environmental impact) and that any decision
on including such a plant in the investment program would be taken only after
agreement with the Bank in this respect. As a condition of effectiveness, a
loan agreement between UTE and EXIMBANK for financing the thermal plant should
be executed.
10.      Project Benefits:  The proposed project would enable UTE to provide a
more reliable power supply and help overcome the limited energy storage
capacity in the hydroelectric system to offset drought conditions. It would
also help the Government implement its program of public sector reforms aimed
at providing essential inputs to the economy more efficiently. The rate of
return on UTE's investment program for 1990-97 is estimated at 13.52.
11.      Risks:  The main risk is the pose Mle opposition by UTE's staff to
changes in management procedures and worki..g practices under the project's
institutional development componeit. This should be reduced by the training
program and technical assistance from the twinned power utilitv. Moreover, the
probability of success is reasonable given the strategy adopted by UTE's
management for project implement4tion, which incl-udes close consultation with
the union and UTE's staff as well as a gradualist approach to reform. Under
this approach, UTE plans to achieve the reduction of the number of employees
through attrition and not through layoffs. So for UTE has im .emented the IDP
without labor problems.   The project poses no special techn' il risks.
12.      Environment:  No environmental problems are expectt  to result from
the project since equipment specifications and installation design took into
consideration adequate environmental standards.  The new environmental unit, to
be created in UTE's organization structure under this projee.  would supervise
project implementation to ensure that it would be executed with due regard to
environmental considerations.
13.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
