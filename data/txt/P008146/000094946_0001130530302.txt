URUGUAY
POWER SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(Loan 3221-UR)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Sector Modernization
Project in Uruguay for which the Loan 322 1-UR in the amount of US$62.5 million was approved
on June 7, 1990, signed on August 21, 1990 and made effective on October 29,1990. The loan
was closed on June 30, 1999 after two extensions of the closing date. The last transaction
occurred on August 2, 1999 and the undisbursed amount of US$0.428 million was canceled. The
project was co-financed with a loan from the Private Export Financing Corporation (PEFCO) in
the amount of US$35.9 million of which US$0.75 million was canceled, and a grant from the
Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) of the USA in the amount of US$19.3 million of which US$0.45
million was not utilized.
The ICR was prepared by Alvaro J. Covarrubias, Consultant, under the supervision of
Luis M. Vaca-Soto, Task Team Leader. The ICR was reviewed by Asif Faiz (LCC7F), Susan
Goldmark and Maria Victoria Lister (LCSFP). The peer reviewer was Mr. Vladimir Jadrijevic
(LCOPR). The comments of the reviewers have been incorporated into the ICR.
The preparation of the ICR began in December 1998 during an ICR/SPN mission and
continued in June 1999 with a follow-up mission. (Appendix A: KCR Mission Aide-Memoire).
The Borrower, Administraci6n Nacional de Ulsinasy Trasmisiones Elctricas (UTE), produced
its project completion final report in June 1999 and provided additional information in August
1999 (Appendix B: Borrower's Contribution on the K(.R). The ICR is based on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan and the Guarantee Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower and the Guarantor (the Government of Uruguay, GOU),
internal Bank memoranda, and interviews with Bank staff and GOU's and UTE's officials
involved in project preparation, appraisal and implementation.
The Borrower and the cofinanciers were asked to comment on a draft ICR. Comments
were submitted by the Borrower and Eximbank and incorporated into the ICR.

POWER SECTOR MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(Loan 3221-UR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The objectives of the project were to improve: (a) the reliability of meeting short-to-
medium term electricity demand by installing new thermal generating units to help face droughts,
and (b) sector efficiency by upgrading UTE's managerial capability and reducing electricity losses
(para. 2).'
2.    The project included three components: (a) installation of a new thermal plant (powered
by two 113.5MW gas turbines burning diesel fuel) including spare parts, control house,
substation, interconnection to the existing transmission system, fuel pipeline and fuel tanks; (b)
improvement of the power distribution network of Montevideo, consisting of a rehabilitation of
medium and low voltage systems to reduce losses and increase the reliability of service to
customers; and (c) implementation of an Institutional Development Program (IDP) consisting of:
(i) technical assistance for developing adequate procedures, management training, and transfer of
software and computational systems for improving commercial and operating practices through a
corporate twinning contractual arrangement with a foreign utility; (ii) procurement of equipment
to support the technical assistance, and (iii) a training program for technicians and skilled
workers, including the rehabilitation of UTE's training center (para. 3).
3.    Additionally, the loan and guarantee agreement established covenants and specific actions
to be taken by GOU and UTE to establish an environmental unit, adjust electricity tariffs, reduce
arrears, and improve the operational/financial performance of UTE and the power sector. The
objectives were relevant to the power sector of Uruguay and congruent with those pursued by the
GOU and the Bank policies for the power sector prevailing at that time (paras. 4 and 5).
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    Project management was satisfactory. Project implementation was coordinated by a
Project Executing Unit (PEU) constituted in the Planning division and supported by the
Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Finance divisions of UTE. The PEU was managed
by the manager of the Planning division with the support of three project directors responsible for
activities under the three components of the project. The IDP was implemented under a twinning
contract with a foreign power utility, UJnion Electrica Fenosa (UEF) from Spain, in accordance
I Para. and paras. in italics refer to paragraph numbers in the main body of the report.



iv
with a program based on a diagnostic report agreed at appraisal. The International Labor
Organization, (ILO) assisted in the rehabilitation of the training center (para. 6).
5.    Reliability objective was substantially achieved. Since June 1992, the reserve gas
turbine-generating plant built at La Tablada site (named Central Termica de Respaldo - CTR), is
providing back-up thermal generating capacity to the power system whenever the hydroelectric
plants are affected by dry hydrology, and supporting exports to Argentina when required. This,
combined with the improvement made to the Montevideo distribution network, has increased the
reliability of service and reduced the number and duration of power service cuts. In 1998,
customers had, on average, 15.4 power cuts of less than 1.3 hours, and cumulative time of power
cuts of 19.9 hours. In 1993, there were an average of 40.5 power cuts of about 2.2 hours each,
and cumulati ve time of power cuts of 89.1 hours. Current reliability can be considered
satisfactory for a Latin America power utility. As future generation expansion would be based on
thermal units and available electricity would be less dependent on hydrology, reliability could
improve.
6.    Sectoral efficiency objective was substantially achieved. The institutional development
program (IDP) under the project accomplished significant improvements in UTE's organization,
and its operational and financial management performance, established an environmental
management unit in UTE, and rehabilitated UTE's technical training center. Moreover, a set of
studies not initially included in the project was carried out by UTE to support the IDP.
Consequently, a revamped new organization, the use of modern computerized information
systems, and revisions done to electricity tariffs made UTE's operational and financial
performance satisfactory toward the end of the project (paras. 10-20). The distribution
rehabilitation, focused on Montevideo, contributed to the country wide reduction of electricity losses
which decreased fiom 23 percent in 1990 to about 19 percent in 1993 and to about 17 percent since
1995, i.e. above the 15 percent target, mainly due to commercial losses. A loss reduction program
under the on-going Transmission and Distribution project (Loan 3949-UR) includes extensive
measures to address the commercial losses issue and aims at 13 percent total losses by 2001, which
could be considered a satisfactory level in a Latin American power utility. (Paras. 7-9)
7.   Financial management improved. UTE's financial management was improved under the
project. Financial and accounting functions are the responsibility of the Area Manager for
Resources. The computerized accounting system has been centralized in headquarters since
1990. Financial planning follows the norms of the national budget using a computerized long-
term financial planning software model. The autonomous Tribunal de Cuentas (TC) audits
UTE's accounts in accordance with acceptable international standards, submits it to UTE and
informs the Parliament (para. 21).

Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
8.    Project Costs. The project will be completed at a cost of US$225.0 million, or 6.2
percent below the appraisal estimate of US$239.8 million, due to less than expected price
escalation, physical contingencies and interest during construction. At appraisal, overall
contingencies were estimated at 47 percent, but actual contingencies were about 21 percent
(para. 22).
9.    Project Financing. The project was financed by the Bank loan of US$62.5 million
(US$0.428 million canceled) and co-financed by a PEFCO loan of US$35.9 million (US$0.75
million canceled) and an Eximbank-USA grant of US$19.3 million (US$0.45 million not used).
UTE financed US$108.8 million. The Bank financed foreign exchange for the procurement of
generation equipment for the CTR, distribution equipment, spare parts, hardware for the IDP
component, the corporate twinning contract UTE-UEF, the ELO technical assistance, and
consultant services. PEFCO and the Eximbank financed foreign exchange for the acquisition of
the balance of equipment and services. UTE financed local costs and interest during construction
(para. 23).
10.   Project Economic Performance is Satisfactory. The economic performance of the
Tablada thermal plant was recalculated using the Staff Appraisal Report's (SAR's) methodology,
comparing two scenarios for expanding UTE's power supply facilities from 1990 to 2010. One
scenario includes the Tablada thermal plant and the other scenario excludes it. The incremental
stream of investment and O&M (Operation and Maintenance) costs and benefits were expressed
in constant 1990 US$, the latter as the revenue at the prevailing tariffs. The resulting internal
economic rate of return (IERR) is 26 percent. The economic performance of the loss reduction
program was measured based on the cost/benefit of technical and non-technical loss reductions
achieved by the project. The resulting IERR is 22.5 percent. (para. 24)
11.   Major Factors Affecting the Project. The main factors affecting project implementation
were: (a) the high interest of UTE and GOU in installing the Tablada thermal plant as soon as
financing was available, (b) the need of UTE to downsize its annual investment programs to meet
the GOU's macroeconomic and fiscal management targets; and (c) the delays in project
implementation introduced by the long procurement process in UTE and the GOU. Construction
of La Tablada was initiated in September 1990, two years ahead of schedule, and commissioned
in June 1992 one year earlier than planned. But the distribution component was only completed
in December 1999 because of more than three years of delays in its initiation and a scale down in
its implementation rhythm to meet the investment ceilings fixed annually by the GOU (paras. 25-
31).
12.   Bank performance was satisfactory. The Bank staff devoted substantial efforts to project
preparation, and supported UTE in its efforts to advance the contracting and financing of the
Tablada thermal plant. In preparing and appraising the project the Bank staff complied with all



vi
applicable operational directives. The Bank did extensive supervision (72.6 staff-weeks costing
US$228,500) and carried out 11 supervision missions from June 1991 to December 1998. In
doing project supervision the Bank staff applied operational directives with prudence and good
judgement. For example, the Bank accepted UTE's requests to use the single source selection
method to retain UEF in the corporate twinning contract and ILO in the technical assistance for
training center, to extend the loan closing date twice, and to reallocate funds among disbursement
categories. The Bank also used supervision missions to deepen the dialogue with the GOU and
UTE and process Loan 3949-UR supporting the Transmission and Distribution project. This new
project is focused on the implementation of further reform of the power sector and provides
funding for additional investment needed to modernize power facilities (paras. 32-34).
13.   Borrower performance was satisfactory. Project preparation by UTE, as Borrower and
executing agency was satisfactory. The feasibility study, basic engineering and bidding documents for
the Tablada thermal power plant were completed early in project preparation. At appraisal, UTE had
already evaluated tenders for the Tablada thermal plant, sought the non-objection of the Bank to award
the contract, and had advanced negotiations with Eximbank and PEFCO to finance the plant. UTE
could not prepare the Montevideo distribution component as originally scheduled because a first
consultant could not complete the work due to force majeure and UTE had to re-contract the service
with a second consultant. Regarding project implementation, UTE and the Government provided a
good initial momentum to the project by rapidly and satisfactorily implementing the Tablada thermal
plant one year ahead of schedule. This was not so for the Montevideo distribution component, whose
completion was delayed for full completion until December 1999 due to slow procurement and ceilings
in UTE's annual investment program. UTE is using the refurbished laboratories and
meeting/confe:rence rooms at 100 percent capacity for training technical staff in charge of distribution
network maintenance. By 1994, UTE was reorganized, downsized and started using state-of-the-art
computerized systems for power utilities to carry out its technical, financial, administrative and
commnercial operations (parcas. 35-36).
14.   In 1998, the good performance of UTE's organization was recognized by the Government. It
awarded two national prizes to UTE for excellence in quality in the areas of Commercial and
Distribution Management, and Information (para. 37).
15.  C(ompliance with covenants was satisfactory. Since 1995, UTE has been in compliance
with important financial covenants (self-financing, debt service ratio, debt/equity ratio, and
operating ratio) and now has a sound financial position. Also since 1994, it has been delivering
audited accounts reports in a timely fashion, which was not the case before 1994 during the
installation of the computerized new system of accounts. Total accounts receivable of UTE are
about 45 days of billing, i.e. lower than the 60 days covenanted, but private arrears as low as 19
days compensate for government agencies' arrears as high as 150 days of billing. The
clearinghouse system existing among government agencies has not as yet succeeded in reducing
their payables to UTE to less than the covenanted 75 days of billing because of insufficient budget
allocations by the government (para. 38).



vii
Project Sustainability
16.   Several factors make project sustainability likely, namely: (a) the Tablada thermal plant
and other physical facilities installed by the project (distribution system, computer hardware,
training center) meet internationally acceptable levels of quality; (b) UTE has competent staff with
appropriate skills to operate and maintain the new facilities; (c) there is a satisfactory plan for
future project operation; and (d) the finances of UTE are sound and expected to improve further
in the future, especially because of GOU's policy of shifting power sector investment from UTE
to private investors (see below and para. 40). An Energy Efficiency program, under preparation
with GEF support, could further improve the efficiency of energy production and use in Uruguay
while reducing emissions that could increase the risk of climate change.
Project Outcome
17.   The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory because: (a) the Tablada thermal plant
is contributing to the reliability of Uruguay's power supply: it provides the power system with
reserve capacity to be used in case of dry hydrology decreasing the output of hydroelectric plants;
(b) the rehabilitation of the Montevideo distribution network has improved the reliability and
quality of customer service (fewer power cuts of shorter duration), although it has to be
recognized that further improvements are still needed--these are expected to be achieved by the
on-going Transmission and Distribution project (loan 3949-UR); (c) the IDP modernized the
organization and operations of UTE; (d) the recalculated IERR of the Tablada thennal plant (26
percent) and the loss reduction program (22.5 percent) are at satisfactory levels; and (e) project
sustainability is likely (paras. 40-41).
Future Project Operation
1 8.   UTE has a plan for future project operation based on the implementation of the Power
Transmission and Distribution project financed by the Loan 3949-llR (to be closed in December
2002). This operation emphasizes the consolidation of the power sector reform by enhancing the role
of the private sector in power development, consolidating UTE's institutional improvements, and
improving power distribution reliability. Also, a restructured technical assistance component of this
operation is expected to support the Energy Efficiency program under preparation with GEF support.
AU these objectives shape a plan contributing to a safisfactory operation of the project in the future.
UTE is already monitoring sector performance through a set of indicators in line with those
recommended by the Bank. Additional indicators are used to monitor the performance of the Tablada
thermal power plant (paras. 42-43).
Key Lessons Learned
19.   Based on the experience gained with this lending operation, the following lessons can be
offered (para. 44):



viii
Lesson 1.    Early commitments of financing sources and advance procurement are key
factors for expediting project implementation. In this case, early negotiation and approval of
co-financing required for the Tablada thermal power plant, and awarding of the corresponding
construction contract before loan approval permitted UTE to install quickly a thermal power
plant compensating for low hydroelectric generation in years of dry hydrology.
Lesson 2.    A twinning arrangement with a foreign utility is an effective method to
reorganize and modernize the management and operational practices, and associated training
and computerized tools of a local power utility.
Lesson 3.    In a relatively small country, a power utility owned technical training center
equipped with appropriate laboratories and meeting facilities is an effective tool to improve the
skills of personnel in charge of doing maintenance and operation of power distribution systems.
Lesson 4.    Cumbersome processes at company and Government levels for procurement of
equipment and services are major obstacles introducing exorbitant delays in project
implementation. Significant simplification of the procurement process can be achieved at
company level, but improvement at Government level requires a country-wide effort involving
a review of procurement legislation.
Lesson 5     A Project Executing Unit inserted with the existing organization of the
Borrower, staffed with its own competent staff and supported with services from the rest of the
organization, is an effective way to carry out a project. It also allows that institutional memory
and experience gained in the project be used by the Borrower in future projects.

POWER SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
(Loan 3221-UR)
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction
I .    During the period 1950-1995 the Bank made nine loans to Uruguay's power sector totaling
US$342.7 million. These loans assisted Uruguay in: (a) developing thermal and hydroelectric generation,
transmission systems, and power distribution networks, and (b) the organization and the economical,
operational, and financial performance of the power sector. This ICR refers to Loan 3221-UR. Loan
3949-UR (Power Transmission and Distribution Project) is ongoing.
Project Objectives
2.    The objectives of the project were to improve: (a) the reliability of meeting short-to-medium term
electricity demand by installing new thermal generating units to help face droughts; and (b) sector
efficiency by upgrading UTE's managerial capability and reducing electric losses.
3.    The project included three components:
(a) Installation of a new thermal plant (powered by two 113.5MW gas turbines burning diesel fuel)
including spare parts, control house, substation, interconnection to the existing transmission
system, fuel pipeline and fuel tanks. The thermal plant was to be sited in Montevideo at the "L"
substation, and the fuel tanks were to be installed at the Tablada refinery, two miles away from the
plant.
(b) Improvement of the power distribution network of Montevideo, consisting of a rehabilitation of
medium and low voltage systems; and
(c) Institutional Development Program (IDP) consisting of: (i) technical assistance for developing
adequate procedures, management training, and transfer of software and computational systems for
improving commercial and operating practices, through a corporate twinning contractual
arrangement; (ii) procurement of equipment to support the technical assistance; and (iii) a training
program for technicians and skilled workers, including the rehabilitation of UTE's training center.
4.    To achieve the efficiency improvement objective, the loan and guarantee agreement established
covenants to be complied with, and specific actions to be taken by the GOU and UTE to establish an
environmental unit, adjust electricity tariffs, reduce arrears, and improve the operationallfinancial
performance of UTE and the power sector.



2
5.    The project's objectives were relevant to the power sector of Uruguay, and were clearly stated in
the SAR. The objectives were congruent with those pursued by the GOU and with the Bank policies for
the power sector prevailing at that time.2 Conforming to those policies, the project design was oriented to
achieve, the objective of improving power service reliability by adding power generation reserve and the
objective of improving sectoral efficiency by upgrading the distribution facilities in Montevideo and
improving UTE's operational performance through institutional development program.
B. Achievement of Objectives
Implementation Organization
6.    The Project Executing Unit (PEU) was UTE's planning division whose manager acted as project
coordinator with the help of three project directors responsible for activities under the three components of
the project. The PEU worked within the framework of UTE's organization with support from the
divisions in charge of engineering, procurement, construction and finance. Those divisions provided
technical and project management guidance to ensure that design, procurement and construction of the
physical components were to be executed in a timely and orderly manner. Consultants assisted UTE's staff
in project design and supervision of the rehabilitation works. The IDP was implemented by UTE under a
twinning contract with a foreign power utility, UAnion El&trica Fenosa (UEF) from Spain, in accordance
with a program based on a diagnostic report agreed at appraisal, and assistance in staff training from the
International Labor Organization (ILO). UEF had been assisting UTE in a first phase of the IDP and the
Bank had no objection to UTE to retain UEF for completing the IDP. Project management was
satisfactory.
Reliability Objective
7.    Reliability objective was substantially achieved. Since June 1992, the reserve gas turbine-
generating plant built at La Tablada site (named Central Termica de Respaldo, CTR) is providing back-up
thermal generating capacity to the power system whenever the hydroelectric plants are affected by
hydrology dry years. This, combined with the improvement made to the Montevideo distribution network,
has increased the reliability of service and reduced the number and duration of service cuts. However, the
level of electricity lo-sses were reduced but remained stagnant above the target set by the project.
8.    La Tablada thermal reserve plant, comprising two brand new industrial type 113 MW gas
turbine/generator units, was commissioned in June 1992--one year ahead of schedule. An oil pipeline
transports the gas-oil used by this power plant from La Tablada oil-refinery. The plant has a very good
efficiency of 270 gr. of fuel per kWh (2880 kCal/kWh). It has achieved its objective by providing Uruguay
with reserve generation during dry hydrology years (1997-1998) and supporting exports to Argentina
when required (1993-94).
2  Bank's policy for the electric power subsector was detailed in OMS 3.72 dated 1978.

Sectoral Efficiency Objective
9.    Sectoral efficiency objective was substantially achieved. Improvement of the Montevideo
distribution network under this project is near completion and has accomplished most of its objectives. It
had a slow initial implementation but is expected to be fully completed by end-December 1999. The
improvement of the distribution network has steadily reduced the number and duration of power cuts in
Montevideo to satisfactory levels. In 1998, customers had, on average, 15.4 cuts of less than 1.3 hours,
and cumulative of 19.9 hours. This is compared with an average 40.5 power cuts of about 2.2 hours, and
cumulative time of power cuts of 89.1 hours in 1993. Total electricity losses were 23 percent in 1990,
decreased to about 19 percent in 1993 and have remained at about 17 percent since 1995. Electricity losses
continue to be concentrated in technical losses in the old distribution network of Montevideo--where the 6 kV
ungrounded distribution voltage level is inadequate--and commercial losses. A loss reduction program being
implemented by UTE under the Transmission and Distribution project (loan 3949-UR) includes extensive
measures to address commercial losses. That program is expected to reduce total electricity losses to 13 percent
by year 2001.
10.   The institutional development program (IDP) under the project accomplished significant
improvements in the organization and operational and financial management performance of UTE,
established an environmental management unit in UTE, and rehabilitated UTE's technical training center.
Moreover, a set of studies not initially included in the project was carried out to support UTE's
institutional development. Consequently, a revamped new organization, the use of modern information
systems, and reviews done to electricity tariffs, improved UTE's operational and financial performance
significantly toward the end of the project, and can now be considered as satisfactory.
11.   The IDP rationalized UTE's organization, decentralized the management of power distribution
networks, and introduced job descriptions. Personnel decreased from 10,550 employees in 1990 to 8,002
in 1998 by partially replacing retirees and attrition. The IDP installed several state-of-the-art management
and planning tools: (a) an integrated strategic planning system; (b) a MIS (Management Information
System) for technical operations control; (c) a personnel management system comprising staff roster, staff
selection and promotion, payment of salaries and allowances, staff training, medical controls; (d) a
computerized accounting and budget system; (e) computerized systems for billing, meter reading, and
customer complaint handling; and (f) electronic mail (about 2,000) for managers and key staff. The
managers and staff have been trained on all these systems under a twinning contract with a foreign utility
(Ufnion Elctrica Fenosa of Spain).
12.   Also, the IDP created the UTE's Environment Management Unit and trained its staff. This unit
oversees the design-and operations of UTE's facilities to ensure compliance with international
environmental standards. The unit is currently working towards ISO 14000 (International Organization for
Standardization - Standards for Environmental Management Systems) certification of UTE.
13.   UTE's technical training center was rehabilitated and expanded. The center was refurbished with
laboratories and meeting rooms to provide practical and theoretical training to UTE's technicians in charge
of maintenance of power distribution networks. The 1LO assisted UTE in rehabilitating and preparing a
work program for the center. The center is also used as venue for technical seminars and workshops.
Currently, the work program of the center utilizes 100 percent of its capacity.

14.   In addition to the study on firewood-based power plants (not financed by the Bank), during its
implementation, the project incorporated other studies that were necessary to complete some of IDP's
activities. Studies were carried out on the following matters: (a) environmental management, to define a
training program for the staff of the environmental unit. Implementation of the recommendations made by
the study endowed the environmental management unit with competent staff, (b) electric load curves, to
develop a methodology for the characterization of customers demand. UTE adopted the methodology; (c)
statistics applied to the study on electric load curves; (d) preparation of standard bidding documents for the
procurement of goods and services, and (e) reactive power compensation to optimize UTE's power system
through year 2002.
15.   The impact of the IDP on UTE's financial performance was mixed early in project implementation,
but improved significantly towards the end of the project as shown by key financial indicators. The rate of
return on assets in operation did not reach the covenanted value in all the years but was always positive,
and self-financing always was at a satisfactory level-except in dry years that forced UTE to increase
thermal generation and introduce rationing to compensate for the shortage of hydroelectric generation.
Debt service coverage ratio has been acceptable since the early 1990's; and debt/equity ratio and operating
ratio have also remained at acceptable values since 1995. (Table 1.1)
16.   (JTE's sell financing and rate of return. Self-financing has been in the satisfactory range 43-97
percent, except in 1990 (1.0 percent because of a very dry year). During that very dry year electricity
rationing decreased sales and at the same time fuel costs increased because of more thermal generation
compensating for shortage of hydroelectric generation. As a consequence, the rate of return plummeted to
2.1 percent in 1990, but later recovered to about 7 percent in 1994 and 1995, and was 6.8 percent in 1998.
17.   UITE did not default in the debt service coverage ratio covenant. Until 1992, UTE did not reach
the covenanted 1.5 debt service coverage ratio, but did not default on it (it was as low as 0.3 in 1989, a
critical dry year). This ratio began to increase in 1993 and since 1995 it has averaged about 1.9.
18.  lUTE 's debt/equity ratio and operating ratio. These financial indicators have had satisfactory levels
excepting, again, the dry years (in 1989 and 1990 they were about 48/52 for debt/equity, and 0.83 for the
operating ratio), and have improved to about 26/74 and 0.55 in 1998. Although UTE's capital structure
and cash flow can be now considered adequate, there is still room to improve them further by allowing
more private invest:ment in the sector and by reducing operating expenses through further rationalization of
its organization.

Note:  SAR figures for the period 1994/97 were taken from the SAR for Loan 3949-UR Since 1994, accounts receivable covenant
is 30 days for private customers and 60 days for Government agencies.
19.    UTE 's billing and collection procedures are satisfactory. Since 1992, UTE has had modern billing
and collection systems. Monthly billing is done through 57 distribution offices around the country. Data is
transmitted electronically to headquarters, bills are sent to customers four days after metering and given
two weeks for payment. Private customers pay their bills either directly in UTE's offices around the
country or in supermarkets, Banco de la Repuiblica, or lottery agencies, which charge a small collection
fee. Customers are charged a penalty increasing with the delay in bill payment, and disconnected from
service when the delay exceeds 21 days. Reconnection of service is done within 24 hours after payment.
The system is working well as reflected in a steady decrease in private accounts receivable to about 19
days of billing in 1998. But Government agencies, having a record of payable to UTE exceeding 150 days
of billing --about 15 percent of UTE's total billing-- have increased UTE's total accounts receivable to
about 45 days in 1998. The GOU created a "clearing-house system" to compensate owed balances among
the main public entities but the system could succeed only if the GOU allocates sufficient budget to
compensate for the overall unbalance (Table 1.2).

20.   Electricity tariffs. Electricity tariffs evolved over the years following the recommendations made
by a tariff study completed in 1982 by an independent consultant financed by the Bank Loan 1779-UR
(Fifth Power Project). This study was updated in 1995 by competent UTE staff and found satisfactory by
the Bank, particularly in the determination of the long-range marginal costs (LRMC) and the tariff
structure. The present average tariff of 11 US cents/kWh is slightly higher than the LRMC. The tariff
categories were rationalized, their structure was improved (consumers pay in accordance with their impact
on the load curve and their distance to the generation sources) and demand-side management is now done
by using Time-of-Day-Use tariff (TOD) (Table 1.3)
21.   Financial management. UTE's financial management was improved by the project. Financial and
accounting functions are the responsibility of the Area Manager for Resources. The accounting system is
centralized in headquarters. The current computerized accounting system, in full operation since 1990,
contains financial records, inventory and budget control, billing, fixed assets and payroll and other
administrative systems. Financial planning follows the norms of the national budget using a computerized
long-term financial planning software model. This model was prepared jointly by UTE and the Bank. The
autonomous Tribunal de Cuentas (TC) in accordance with acceptable international standards, audits
UTE's accounts, submits it to UTE and informs the Parliament. The installation and test of the
computerized accounting system during the period 1989-1993 delayed the issuance of UTE and project's
audited reports by up to 8 months. Later, UTE provided the Bank with audit reports on time, but had to
request postponements whenever delays (up to six months) were caused by TC's review of accounts.
Project Cost
22.   The project will be completed at a cost of US$225.0 mnillion, or 6.2 percent below the appraisal
estimate of US$239.8 million. This can be explained by lower than estimated price escalation, physical
contingencies and i-nterest during construction made at appraisal. At appraisal overall contingencies were
estimated at 47 percent, but actual overall contingencies were about 21 percent. Actual contingencies for
project components were 22 percent for the Tablada thermal plant, 40 percent for Montevideo distribution,
almost 0 percent for the IDP, and minus 14 percent for interest during construction (Part 11, Table 8A:
Project Cost).



7
Project Financing.
23.   The project was financed by the Bank loan of US$62.5 million (US$0.428 million canceled) and
cofinanced by a PEFCO loan of US$35.9 million (US$0.75 million canceled) and an Eximbank-USA grant
of US$19.3 million (US$0.45 million not used). UTE financed US$108.8 million. Thus, actual
contribution to project financing was shared among the Bank (27.6 percent), PEFCO (15.6 percent),
Eximbank (8.4 percent) and UTE (48.4 percent, i.e. 2.5 percent points less than the appraisal estimate).
The Bank financed foreign exchange for the procurement of generation equipment for the CTR,
distribution equipment, spare parts, hardware for the IDP component, the twinning contract UTE-UEF, the
ILO technical assistance, and consultant services. PEFCO and the Eximbank financed foreign exchange for
the acquisition of balance of equipment and services. UTE financed local costs and interest during
construction (Part II, Table 8B: Project Financing).
Project Economic Performance
24.   The economic performance of the Tablada thermal plant was recalculated comparing the stream of
incremental costs and benefits of two scenarios for expanding UTE's facilities 1990 to 2010. One scenario
includes the Tablada thermal plant and the other scenario excludes it. Investment and O&M (Operation
and Maintenance) costs are expressed in constant 1990 US$ excluding taxes, and benefits are also
expressed in constant 1990 US$ revenue at the prevailing tariffs. The resulting internal economic rate of
return (IERR) is 26 percent. The assumptions used in developing both scenarios and the stream of costs
and benefits are indicated in Table 9A Economic Costs and Benefits. This approach to recalculation of the
project IERR follows the one in the SAR. The Tablada thermal plant was economically evaluated as part
of a least-cost expansion scenario providing reserve capacity to compensate for low hydroelectric
generation during dry years in a system with a large hydroelectric component, based on random hydrology
series. The economic performance of the loss reduction program was measured based on the incremental
cost/benefit of the program. Benefits from technical loss reduction were valued at the marginal savings in
generation. Benefits from non-technical loss reduction were valued at the prevailing electricity tariff. The
resulting IERR is 22.5 percent (Table 9B).
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
25.   The main factors influencing the implementation of the project were: (a) the high interest of UTE
and the GOU in installing the Tablada thermal plant as soon as financing was available; (b) the need of
UTE to downsize its annual investment programs to meet the GOU's macroeconomic and fiscal
management targets; and (c) the delays in project implementation introduced by the long procurement
process prevailing in UTE. All these factors combined delayed project completion from June 1997 to
December 1999. At the same time, these factors entailed amendments to the loan agreement to extend the
loan closing date, and to reallocate the proceeds of the Bank loan among the various project components.
26.   lJTE and the GO U gave high priority to the installation of La Tablada thermal plant to be prepared
to cope with future dry hydrology years limiting hydroelectric generation. In fact, construction of La
Tablada was initiated in September 1990, two years ahead of schedule, and commissioned in June 1992
one year earlier than planned. However, UTE had to delay by more than three years the initiation of the



8
Montevideo distribution network improvement because it had to slow down the implementation rhythm of
the distribution component to meet the annual investment ceiling fixed by the GOU.
27.   Procurenment of goods and services was done quickly for the Tablada thermal plant but significantly
spread over more than five years for the Montevideo distribution component instead of the two years
envisioned at appraisal. Procurement for the institutional development program took almost two years
longer than expected, but procurement for the training program was completed 6 months earlier than
planned. Procurement of equipment and construction services involved a total of 55 calls for bids.
Awarding of contracts for the supply of equipment and services was completed in 1998.
28.   UTE carried out procurement using standard bidding documents satisfying Bank guidelines. But
the elapsed time from call for bids to contract awarding and signature has been extremely long for large
contracts (many examples of two or more years) because these are required to pass numerous approvals
first inside UTE and then in the Government's agencies. Also, the clearing of claims made by suppliers has
introduced additional delays at the contract awarding stage. (Part II, Table 5: Indicators for Project
Implementation) UTE has succeeded in reducing the time incurred in its internal procurement process by
bettering coordination among technical and administrative departments. However, a reduction of times
incurred by the Government's agencies in approving procurement has become a country issue beyond the
competence of UTE to resolve.
29.   The performance of contractors was satisfactory. The supply of goods and services was of good
quality. UTE's technical staff, with the assistance of consultants, performed satisfactorily in supervising the
supply of equipment and materials supplied and the quality of the construction works. The contractor of
La Tablada Thermal plant installed it ahead of schedule.
30.   Loan disbiursement was significantly better than expected in the period FY91 -FY94 (cumulative
disbursement in FY92 reached 427 percent of appraisal estimate), slowed down in the period FY95-FY97
(as low as 81 percent in FY96), but picked up in FY98 and FY99. The early good disbursement rate was
caused by disbursement of funds needed for the rapid installation of the Tablada thermal plant. The slow
down in loan disbursement mirrored the low implementation rhythm of the Montevideo distribution
component. The loan closing date had to be extended the first time from December 31, 1997 to January
31, 1999 to allow UTE to complete the Montevideo distribution component. A second extension of the
loan closing to June 1999 was necessary to allow UTE to finance the supply of essential kWh meters and
distribution cables, delivery of which the manufacturers had delayed beyond control of UTE. The last
transaction occurred on August 2, 1999 and the amount of US$0.428 million was canceled (Part II, Table
4: Loan Disbursement).
31.   Slpecial account and loan utilization. To facilitate loan disbursements and payments to suppliers,
UTE opened a special account in the Central Bank of Uruguay in accordance with the provisions
established in the loan agreement. The Bank replenished the project's special account at a level of US$2.8
million upon applications made by UTE.



9
D. Bank Performance
32. Bank performance was satisfactory in project identification, preparation and appraisal. The
Bank staff devoted substantial efforts to project preparation and supported UTE in its efforts to advance
the contracting and financing of the Tablada thermal plant. But preparation of the Montevideo distribution
component was delayed because UTE had to recontract the studies due to force majeure.
Notwithstanding, all this is reflected in a SAR of good quality. The SAR defined sound project objectives
and physical scope, and a clear institutional development program. It also included a good project
justification and economic analysis based on the standard guidelines of the Bank for this type of project. In
preparing and appraising the project the Bank staff complied with all applicable operational directives. The
loan was approved on June 7, 1990, signed on August 21, 1990 and became effective on October 29,
1990.
33.   Bank performance in supervision was satisfactory. The Bank carried out extensive supervision of
the project from June 1991 to December 1998, comprising I I supervision missions (72.6 staff-weeks
costing US$228,500). (Part II, Table 12: Bank Resources: Staff Inputs; Table 12: Bank Resources:
Missions). In doing project supervision the Bank staff exercised prudence and good judgement in applying
Bank operational directives when, for example, they accepted UTE's request to use the single source
selection method to retain UEF in the twinning contract and ILO in the technical assistance for training
center, and to extend the loan closing date twice. The first extension allowed UTE finance pending
procurement of equipment for the Montevideo distribution component. The second extension allowed
UTE to disburse funds to pay for kWh meters and power cables for which the delivery had been delayed by
the suppliers beyond the revised loan closing date. Also, reallocation of the proceeds of the Bank loan was
done in 1991, increasing Bank financing of the Tablada thermal plant from US$27.0 million to US$28.0
million to partially cover foreign cost overruns. In 1998, reallocation of funds was done again, this time to
increase financing of the Montevideo distribution component from US$10.0 million to US$22.3 million.
34.   The Bank also used supervision missions to deepen the dialogue with the GOU and UTE and
process Loan 3949-UR. supporting the Transmission and Distribution project. This project is focused on
the implementation of a deeper reform of the power sector and provides funding for additional investment
needed to modernize the Uruguayan power sector.
E. Borrower Performance
3 5.   Pro ject preparation by (ITE as Borrower and executing agency was satisfactory. Specifically, the
feasibility study, basic engineering and bidding documents for the Tablada thermal power plant were completed
early in project preparation. At appraisal time UTE had already evaluated tenders for the Tablada thermal plant,
sought non-objection of the Bank to award the contract, and had advanced negotiations with the Eximbank and
PEFCO for financing the plant. Unfortunately, UTE could not prepare the Montevideo distribution component
as scheduled because the consultant could not complete the work due to force majeure and UTE had to re-
contract the service.
36.   Project implementation. UTE and the GOU gave a good initial momentum to the project by doing a
rapid and satisfactory implementation of the Tablada thermal plant one year ahead of schedule. Later, the GOU
macroeconomic management led UTE to reduce the annual budget allocated to implementation of the



10
Montevideo distribution component. This fact combined with initially long procurement process in UTE,
and always lengthy approvals by the Government agencies, slowed down the implementation rhythm of this
component and its completion originally anticipated for December 1995, is now expected by end-
December 1999. On this front UTE took measures that decreased significantly the time of procurement of
equipment and services, but no improvement was done at Government level. The refurbishing of UTE's
training center for technical staff in charge of distribution network maintenance was completed satisfactorily.
ILO assisted UTE effectively in defining the needs and programs of the training center. The laboratories and
meeting/conference rooms of the center are utilized at 100 percent of its capacity. The twinning contract
between UTE and UEF was also very effective in implementing the IDP component. UTE was reorganized,
down-sized and enidowed with state-of-the-art computerized systems for power utilities to carry out technical,
financial, administrative and commercial operations. The implementation of the IDP, because of its complexity,
had a slow start but was fully completed in 1994 (Part II, Table 5: Key indicators of Project Implementation).
37.   In 1998, the good performance of UTE's organization was recognized by the GOU, which awarded two
national prizes to UTE for excellence in quality of its Commercial and Distribution Management, and
Information.
38.  (Compliance with covenants. Since 1995 UTE is in compliance with important financial covenants
(self-financing, debt service ratio, debt/equity ratio, and operating ratio) and now has a sound financial
position. Also since 1994, it is delivering audited accounts reports timely, which was not the case before
1994 during the installation of the computerized new system of accounts. Total accounts receivable of
UTE are about 45 days of billing, i.e. lower than the 60 days covenanted, but private arrears as low as 19
days compensate for arrears from Government agencies as high as 150 days of billing. The clearing system
existing among Government agencies has not as yet succeeded in reducing their payable to UTE to less
than the covenante,d 75 days of billing because of insufficient budget allocations by the GOU (Table 1.1,
Financial Indicators, and Part II, Table 10: Status of Covenants).
39.   Based on the above, Borrower performance is considered satisfactoryfor both project
implementation and compliance with covenants.
F. Assessment of Project Outcome and Sustainability
Project Sustainability
40.   Several factors make project sustainability likely, namely: (a) the Tablada thermal plant and other
physical facilities installed by the project (distribution system, computer hardware, training center) meet
internationally acceptable levels of quality; (b) UTE has competent staff with appropriate skills to operate
and maintain the new facilities; (c) there is a satisfactory plan for future project operation; and (d) the
finances of UTE are sound and expected to improve further in the future, especially because of the GOU
policy of shifting investment in the power sector from UTE to private investors (see paras. 42-43 below).
An Energy Efficiency program, under preparation with GEF support could further improve the efficiency
of energy production and use in Uruguay and contribute to reduce emissions that could increase the risk of
climate change.



11
Project Outcome
41.   The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory because: (a) the Tablada thermal plant is
contributing to. the reliability of Uruguay's power supply: it provides the power system with reserve
capacity to be used in case of dry hydrology decreasing the output of hydroelectric plants; (b) the
rehabilitation of the Montevideo distribution network has improved the reliability and quality of customer
service (less power cut of shorter duration), although it has to be recognized it still needs improvements
expected to be achieved by the on-going Transmission and Distribution project (loan 3949-UR); (c) the
IDP modernized the organization and operations of UTE; (d) the recalculated IERR of the Tablada thermal
plant (26 percent) and the loss reduction program (22.5 percent) have satisfactory levels; and (e) the
project sustainability is likely.
G. Future Project Operation
42.   UTE has a plan for future project operation based on the implementation of the Power Transmission and
Distribution project financed by the Loan 3949-VR (to be closed in December 2002). This operation
emphasizes the consolidation of the power sector reform, which enhances the role of the private sector in power
development, the consolidation of UTE's institutional improvements, the improvement of power distribution
reliability, and the promotion of a more efficient use of energy. All these objectives shape a plan that will
certainly contribute to a satisfactory operation of the project in the future.
43.   It is also important to note that UTE is already monitoring the sector through a set of performance
indicators in line with those recommended by the Bank. Additional indicators are used to monitor the
performance of the Tablada thermal power plant (Part II, Table 6: Key Indicatorsfor Prqject Operation).
H. Key Lessons Learned
44.   Based on the experience gained with this lending operation, the following lessons can be offered:
Lesson I.    Early commitments of financing sources and advance procurement are key factors for
expediting project implementation. In this case, early negotiation and approval of co-financing required
for the Tablada thermnal power plant, and awarding of the corresponding construction contract before
loan approval permitted UTE to install quickly a thermal power plant compensating for low
hydroelectric generation in years of dry hydrology.
Lesson 2.    A twinning arrangement with a foreign utility is an effective method to reorganize and
modernize the management and operational practices, and associated training and computerized tools of
a local power utility.
Lesson 3.    In a relatively small country, a power utility owned technical training center equipped
with appropriate laboratories and meeting facilities is an effective tool to improve the skills of personnel
in charge of doing maintenance and operation of power distribution systems.
Lesson 4.    Cumbersome processes at company and Government levels for procurement of
equipment and services are major obstacles introducing exorbitant delays in project implementation.



12
Significant simplification of the procurement process can be achieved at company level, but improvement
at Government level requires a country wide effort involving a review of procurement legislation.
Lesson 5     A Project Executing Unit inserted in the existing organization of the Borrower, staffed
with its own competent staff and supported with services from the rest of the organization, is an effective
way to cairy out a project. It also allows that institutional memory and experience gained in the project
be used by the Borrower in future projects.

Main Assumptions:
*  All values are expressed in constant 1990 US$
*  hncremental investmnent include investment in distribution and technical assistance component
*   Incremental reduction of losses are assumed to be the difference between the actual losses and projected losses (without project) at the
loss levels existing in 1990
*  Benefits are measured based on the incremental loss reduction. Benefits from reduction of non-technical losses are valued at the
prevailing average electricity tariff. Benefits from reduction of technical losses are valued as the marginal savings in generating
electricity. As a proxy and assuming a 1:1 ratio between technical and non-technical losses, benefits were calculated for the total
losses at 80 percent. of the prevailing tariff.

Power Sector Modernization Project (Loan 3221-UR)
Implementation Completion Report Mission
1.    A World Bank Mission (the mission) comprising Messrs. Ricardo Klockner (Task
Manager) and Alvaro J. Covarrubias (Consultant) visited Uruguay from 14 to 19 December
1998 to initiate preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the Power
Sector Moclernization Project (the project) financed by loan 3221-UR. The mission visited
the physical components comprising the project: the 2x1 15 MW gas turbine power plant;
part of the Montevideo distribution system; and UTE's training center. The mission is
grateful for the effective cooperation and hospitality received from the management and staff
of UTE, and the Government officials. The Aide-Memoire summarizes the project status,
the main sulbjects discussed, and the agreements on the ICR reached with UTE.
Project status.
2.    The 2xl 15 MW gas turbine power generating plant was commissioned in January
1992 and it has been operating commercially in a successful manner. The distribution
component is expected to be completed by December 1999. The training center was
inaugurated in February 1996 and it is operating successfully. The institutional development
component of the project has also been completed and it is functioning satisfactorily.
3.    Annex 1 contains the project cost and financing, and the status of the on-going
contracts for goods and services. Latest estimates indicate that the project will be
completed at a cost of US$238.7 million. The loan will be fully disbursed once the payment
of US$1.9 nmillion for the purchase of 80,0000 kWh meters, to be delivered at the end of
January 1999, had been processed by UTE and the Bank.
Completioni report to be prepared by the borrower (UTE)
4.    The mission explained to the management and staff of UTE that as a borrower the
World Bank, should prepare a project completion report shortly after loan is closed, in
order to comply with the Section 9.07 of the General Conditions of World Bank loans. The
mission provided UTE's staff with guidelines which will assist them prepare the completion
report. In particular, UTE's report should include:
* A summary of no more than 10 pages if the report is longer than 10 pages.
* An evaluation of the project's objectives, design, implementation, and the
experience acquired during project implementation.



27
* A comparison between the actual physical and institutional development achieved
to those expected to be achieved
* A self evaluation of UTE's performance during project design, preparation and
implementation, and lessons learned applicable to future projects.
* An evaluation of the quality of Bank's and co-financiers' performance during
project appraisal and supervision. In this front, it will useful to give examples of
problems in procurement of goods and services, loan disbursement and other
factors which affected project cost and schedules.
5.    Also, UTE agreed to include in the report a description of the plan for future
operation of the project. The plan should aim at ensuring sustainability of the project
components. The plan should also contain the appropriate perforrmance indicators to be
monitored and used to evaluate future performance of the project. The attached Annex 2
lists the most important indicators.
6.    UTE agreed to send its project completion report to the Bank by March 31, 1999.
Additional data requested by the mission
7.    The mission requested UTE to make an estimate of the 2xl 15 MW gas turbine
plant's contribution to avoid energy not served from 1992 to 1998. This is part of the
information needed to recalculate the internal economic rate of return of this project
component. Also, UTE will send to the Bank by mid-January 1999 the investment cost
program, O&M and fuel cost, and actual sales which are necessary to re-calculate the
intermal economic rate of return of its investment program over the period 1990 to 1998.

Executive Summary in English
of Borrower's Contribution
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT - SUMMARY
URUGUAY POWER MODERNIZATION PROJECT
(Loan No. 3221-UR)
June 8, 1999
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS
The Power Modernization Project was partially financed by the Bank Loan 322 1-UR
(US$62.5million) signed on August 21, 1990. A grant of the Export Import Bank of USA
(US$19.3million) and a loan from PEFCO (US$35.9million) also financed the project.
Project objectives were to: (a) improve Borrower's capacity to meet the demand of electricity in
drought conditions, installing additional generation capacity, (b) improve the efficiency of the power sector
by enhancing the institutional capacity of the Borrower and reducing electricity losses, and (c) implement
the institutional development program.
The project was composed of: (a) La Tablada Reserve Thermal Power Plant, including two gas
turbines of 113.5MW each, and auxiliary facilities and civil works; (b) improvements in the distribution
network of the city of Montevideo; and (c) institutional development program including improvement of
information, communication and computing systems and training.
Organization for Project Execution
A Project UJnit is in charge of Project implementation and coordination. The Unit is well staffed
and supported by the UTE's areas of Procurement, Works and Projects, and Economics and Financing.
PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES
All procurement was performed following Bank's procurement guidelines.
COMPARISON OF PLANNED AND CURRENT PHYSICAL RESULTS
The La Tablada Reserve Thermal Power Plant was completed 6 months before scheduled. The
remodeling of the Montevideo's distribution network is expected to be completed 4 years after scheduled.
The institutional component was completed 18 months after scheduled.

Studies Performed and Implementation of Recommendations
Consultants performed eleven studies and almost all recommendations have been implemented.
The rest are in process of being implemented.
PROJECT COST AND FINANCING. BANK LOAN DISBURSEMENTS
Project cost and financing information and Bank Loan disbursements are included in the tables of
Sections 6 and 7 of Appendix B.
FACTORS THAT AFFECTED THE PROJECT'S IMPLEMENTATION
Factors that affected the Project's implementation are: (a) initial delays in the works of the
distribution network until designs were completed; (b) extension of closing date to complete current and
new procurement processes; (c) procurement delays and limits to annual investments imposed by the
Government; (d) delays in processing protests of bidders or completing contractual documents; (e)
bankruptcy of contractors and subsequent cancellation of work contracts; (f) external factors that affected
the execution of the contracts for the communication network; and (g) delays in collecting bills from
municipalities.
IMPROVEMENT OF UTE'S ORGANIZATION
Under the general framework of the Project, UTE has implemented a Management Improvement
Project, on the basis of a new organizational model and an integrated Management Information system. As
a result, in 1998 UTE received two national quality awards in the areas of Information Systems and
Distribution and Commercialization.
PLAN FOR FUTURE PROJECT' S OPERATION AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Distribution system. UTE's maintenance programs consist of preventive, corrective and
remodeling plans. Corrective maintenance is performed by account force using specialized equipment. In
year 2000, UTE would start using techniques of corrective maintenance under load. Preventive
maintenance is performed in several areas, including transformers, switches, medium voltage distribution
lines, switching stations. Infrared cameras and pistols are used to detect "hot points" that could entail
operational risks. When any distribution facility fails above an acceptable rate, it is remodeled to return it
to optimal operational conditions.
Reserve Thermal Power Plant. A team of ten specialists following manufacturer's
recommendations performs the preventive maintenance plan.



32
UTE AND BANK' S PERFORMANCE IN PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND IMPLEMENTATION
UTE and Bank's performance are considered satisfactory, in spite of the initial delays in starting the
implementation of Project's distribution component.
LESSONS LEARNED
(a) the implementation of a new procurement process aimed to solve detected problems and reduce delays
was successfiul; and
(b) bidders who present protests that are rejected should compensate UTE for the costs and delays
incurred.

8) FACTORES  QUE  INFLUYERON   SOBRE  LA  IMPLEMENTACION   DEL
PROYECTO
(a) Atraso Inicial
Las Obras de Distribucion tuvieron un atraso inicial, debido a la indefinicion del proyecto.
(b) Pr6rroga del Prestamo
Debido a los inconvenientes antes mencionados y a los efectos de lograr una continuidad en las
Obras, se prorrog6 la fecha de cierre del Prestamo. Dada la existencia de fondos remanentes se
procedi6 a ampliar las licitaciones de distribuci6n FIl l , F 111 bis y Fl 12 bis, y surgieron las
licitaciones F 102, F103 y F1 14.
(c) El Prestatario
Iniciada la etapa de implementacion se verificaron atrasos debido a multiples razones, algunas
de las cuales se enumeran a continuaci6n:
*r    En la ejecuci6n del Proyecto se ha detectado la demora en el proceso de contrataci6n de
las licitaciones, principalmente el tiempo incurrido entre la elaboraci6n de los pliegos y la firma
del contrato correspondiente, asi mientras en el Appraisal se estimaba en I ano, la realidad
mostr6 que fue en algunos casos 48 meses.
*     Las inversiones financiadas a veces no se ejecutaron con prioridad y por lo tanto, se
vieron afectadas por los sucesivos recortes presupuestales por decisi6n del Gobierno.
(d) Adquisici6n de suministros
*     Se presentaron impugnaciones de los oferentes que dilataron mas de lo habitual el
proceso de contrataci6n, ademas de producirse atrasos a causa de la lentitud en el respectivo
tramite por parte del Tribunal de Cuentas de la Republica.
*     Al gunos oferentes llegaron a la etapa de firma del contrato sin la documentaci6n
correspondiente (en ese momento comenzaron a gestionar los poderes) o sin la correcta
documentaci6n, demorandose la firma de los mismos.



38
(e) Contratistas
*     Con respecto a las obras civiles y montaje de estaciones en general, no hubo aspectos
relevantes a resaltar habiendose cumplido los contratos en forma satisfactoria.
*     Se presentaron atrasos originados en la necesidad de UTE de dejar sin efecto algunos
contratcos, debido a la quiebra de uno de los integrantes del consorcio adjudicatario.
*     De manera similar que en el caso de los suministros, los contratistas presentaron
problemas de documentacion a la hora de la firma de los contratos.
*     En la CTR se iniciaron los tramites de la licitaci6n antes de la firma del pr6stamo, por lo
que se estim6 el costo con mas precisi6n ya que a priori se tenia conocimiento del costo de la
obra a realizar.
*     Se obtuvo un buen financiamiento por la donaci6n del EXIMBANK y el prestamo del
PEFCO
(If) Factores externos
*     Factores ajenos a UTE impidieron realizar las licitaciones de comunicaciones (red
troncal de comunicaciones).
(g) Tarifas, facturaci6n y cobranza
*     Se cumplieron los acuerdos sobre tarifas
*     ]La mayoria de las condiciones contractuales del prestamo se estAn cumpliendo, con la
excepci6n de las Cuentas por Cobrar. Esta Clausula estipula que las agencias y departamentos
del Gobiemo deben pagar sus cuentas en un plazo no mayor de 60 dias de facturaci6n.
Para el piresente anjo, estos atrasos aumentarian a 147 dias de facturaci6n. UTE con la asistencia
de la Ol'P, ha alcanzado acuerdos con la mayoria de las Intendencias, por lo que se espera
reducir el nivel de atrasos gradualmente dentro de los pr6ximos 12 meses.
9) ACTUACION DE LA ORGANIZACION DE UTE
En el marco del Proyecto de Modernizaci6n, UTE inici6 en 1988 un Proyecto de Mejora de la
Gesti6n (PMG), basado en la implantaci6n de un nuevo modelo organizativo y un conjunto
integrado de Sistemas de Informaci6n, para lograr asi una gesti6n moderna y eficaz.
Se modific6 radicalmente la organizaci6n; en forma simulta.nea se implantaron los nuevos
sistemas informaticos corporativos volcados a los procesos de la empresa, se estableci6 un plan
de formaci6n que gradualmente se extendi6 a todas las unidades, y fundamentalmente comenz6
a vislumbrarse un cambio cultural, un cambio en la gente de la empresa.
Los niveles gerenciales, dispuestos a renovarse, adoptaron nuevas tecnicas de direcci6n, entre
ellas, fijaron objetivos y establecieron parAmetros para medir la gesti6n, que fueron asumidos
por todo el personal.
En 1998 UTE recibi6 dos premios nacionales de calidad en las 6reas de Informatica y de
Distribuci6n y Comercial, los citados premios son un reconocimiento que hace el Gobierno a las
organizaciones que se han destacado en la aplicaci6n de procesos de calidad, a traves de un
enfoque de cambio hacia la gesti6n total de calidad.

10) PLAN PARA LA OPERACION FUTURA DEL PROYECTO, E ,INDICADOREs
PARA REALIZAR EL SEGUIMIENTO Y EVALUACION DE RESULTADOS.
Distribuci6n
Las actividades de mantenimiento que se realizan se subdividen en: correctivas, preventivas y
remodelaciones generales.
Las actividades de mantenimiento correctivo y preventivo se realizan con personal propio y las
de remodelaciones generales con personal contratado.
Mantenimiento Correctivo
El mantenimiento correctivo que se realiza en las redes de distribuci6n se subdivide en dos:
reparaciones menores y reparaciones de mayor envergadura. Las pequefias reparaciones se
realizan a traves de la Brigada de Operaci6n, la cual opera las redes mediante maniobras cuando
se producen incidencias de fallas. Las operaciones correctivas de mayor importancia como por
ejemplo el cambio de transformadores, de Ilaves seccionadoras e interruptores, el enderezado de
postes, el flechado de conductores, etc, son realizadas mediante Brigadas de Mantenimiento, las
cuales requieren recursos humanos y equipos especializados.
Los trabajos de mantenimiento correctivo en media tensi6n se Ilevan a cabo desenergizando las
redes. El pr6ximo affo se realizarin los trabajos de mantenimiento con tensi6n.
Mantenimiento Preventivo
Entre las tareas de mantenimiento preventivo se encuentra el tratamiento de aceite de
transformadores mediante maquinas que lo someten a ciclos de calentamiento, vacio y filtrado.
El aceite es analizado controlindose su rigidez dielectrica, su acidez y los gases disueltos
mediante aparatos portAtiles o mediante cromatografias realizadas en laboratorio.
Los disyuntores de pequeiio volumen de aceite son revisados peri6dicamente y se procede al
cambio de aceite cuando su estado o la cantidad de actuaciones asi lo requiere.
Las lineas de media tensi6n son recorridas peri6dicamente de acuerdo a rutinas preestablecidas
a los efectos de realizar inspecciones visuales de su condici6n.
Las podas de arboles pr6ximos a las redes de MT y el volteado de nidos son tareas que se
realizan peri6dicamente y se intensifican en las epocas del afio en que los arboles se desarrollan
con mayor velocidad y los pAjaros construyen sus nidos contra los aisladores de las lineas.
Tambidn se realizan visitas frecuentes a las estaciones reductoras de MT/MT, de acuerdo a
procedimientos de mantenimiento preestablecidos.
Permanentemente se realizan inspecciones termogrAficas con una camara de gran definici6n y
rendimiento. Ademas se dispone de pistolas detectoras de infrarrojos que permiten medidas
puntuales de temperaturas. En 6pocas de mayor demanda se recorren las lineas con la camara
termografica para detectar puntos calientes.
Mantenimiento mediante remodelaciones generales
Cuando la incidencia de fallas en un tramo de red indica una frecuencia que se considera
inaceptable, se estudia la conveniencia de realizar una remodelaci6n general para dejarla en
condiciones 6ptimas de operaci6n.
Central Termica de Respaldo
El programa de mantenimiento es el recomendado por los fabricantes, de acuerdo a los
manuales de General Electric, y esta vinculado al numero de horas y numero de arranques.



40
En relaci6n al mantenimiento programado, tenemos un sistema informatizado que nos emite
automfiticamente las 6rdenes de trabajo, a los efectos de realizar el mantenimiento programado
de los diferentes equipos y sistemas.
La central cuenta con un personal permanente de mantenimiento:
I jefe
2 encargados
6 oficiales
I representante de la oficina t6cnica
y el apoyo del personal de las centrales termicas.
12) JUJICIO DE UTE SOBRE SU PROPIA ACTUACION Y DEL BANCO EN LA
PREPARACION, EVALUACION E IMPLEMENTACION DEL PROYECTO.
Consicleramos que la actuaci6n del Banco y de UTE fueron satisfactorias aunque en la etapa de
preparaci6n del proyecto, este no se defini6 en la componente de distribuci6n, lo cual llev6 a
producir un atraso en la implementacion de la misma.
13) LECCIONES EXTRAIDAS DEL PROYECTO
*  Se detectaron problemas en el proceso licitatorio de UTE.
Es fundamentalmente por esta raz6n que en la actualidad se implement6 un plan que mejor6
dicho proceso acortando significativamente los plazos.
*  Los oferentes que recurren basados en una argumentaci6n que no da lugar a un cambio de
decisi6n deberian resarcir de alguna manera a UTE por los costos y demoras en que incurre
la Administraci6n.
