REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND (IFCT)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $25 million to the
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT), to be guaranteed by
the Kingdom of Thailand. Interest on the loan would be at 8.9 percent
per annum. The loan would be repaid in conformity with a schedule based
on the aggregate of the amortization schedules of IFCT's subloans, which
would have a maximum repayment period of fifteen years, including up to
three years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Thailand Current Economic Prospects and Selected
Development Issues" (924-TH) was distributed under cover of Secretary's Memo-
randum (M75-799) dated November 20, 1975, to the Executive Directors and to
members of the Consultative Group for Thailand. The report of an economic
mission which visited Thailand in June 1976, is expected to be distributed
to the Executive Directors in October. Country data are given in Annex I.
Recent Political Events
3.        The Government of Dr. Sanya Dhammasakdi, which came to power
after the overthrow of the military government of Field Marshals Thanom
and Prapass, successfully adopted a new democratic constitution in October
1974 and held elections in January 1975. After the elections, in which 22
parties won seats, M. R. Kukrit Pramoj, leader of the Social Action Party,
put together a minority coalition government of four centrist parties in
the elected assembly. In late December 1975 the Kukrit Government increased
the retail prices of rice and sugar to bring them into line with the minimum
guaranteed prices previously announced for the current paddy and sugarcane
crops. When this action was challenged by the parliamentary opposition,
the Prime Minister requested H.M. The King to dissolve Parliament. Elections
were held on April 4; the Democratic Party, led by Seni Pramoj (Kukrit's
elder brother), won 115 of the 279 seats. Seni Pramoj was chosen to be the
new Prime Minister and formed a four-party coalition Government on April 21.
On April 30 the new Government received a vote of confidence in the House
of Representatives on its policy statement. The Seni Government lays stress
on meeting the urgent needs of the rural population through policies which,
among others, would tackle the problems of rural indebtedness and accelerate
the implementation of the land reform program.

4.        The international environment altered dramatically soon after
establishment of the Kukrit Government with changes in the political
control of Cambodia, Laos and South Viet-Nam. In adjusting to these
changes the Government secured the agreement of the United States to
withdraw its remaining forces in Thailand by July 1976, established diplo-
matic and trade relations with China, Cambodia and the Socialist Republic of
Viet-Nam, and exercised restraint in responding to diplomatic incidents with
Laos while pursuing a normalization of relations.
Current Economic Situation
5.        Thailand's real GDP expanded at an average rate of 8 percent
during the 1960s with agriculture growing by 5-1/2 percent per year; prices
were virtually stable, open unemployment was minimal and the balance of
payments was in surplus. However, recent years have been more difficult.
In the period 1970-75 performance has been mixed, and for the period as a
whole growth slowed to about 6 percent as a result of: stagnation of
private and public investment in the early 1970s; adverse weather; and
slow progress in intensification of agricultural production which reduced
agriculture's growth to 4 percent a year. In 1973-74 dramatic improvements
in international markets and prices of agricultural commodities raised
Thailand's export earnings by 150 percent. This export boom stimulated a
rapid expansion of demand, production, and private investment and generated
balance of payments surpluses that enabled Thailand to adjust to higher
prices of imported petroleum with less difficulty than most other develop-
ing countries. At the same time, domestic prices increased rapidly, largely
as a result of massive increases in both import and export prices. Since
the summer of 1974, however, the strong stimulus from the external trade
sector has faded as export commodity prices declined while import prices
continued to rise. Consequently, the growth of demand decelerated, the
expansion of manufacturing output slowed, and significant open unemployment
appeared. Part of the new capacity created in the 1973-74 private invest-
ment boom remained underutilized, and excess capacity, together with the
international recession and political uncertainty, caused private invest-
ment to decline in 1975. Still, real growth in 1975 was about 6 percent as
a result of the Government's expansionary fiscal policy (which raised public
expenditure by about 25 percent) and good weather. Slower demand growth and
smaller import price increases also held the rate of inflation to about 4
percent. Assuming normal weather, real GDP should grow by another 6 percent
in 1976, although private investment is likely to continue to be depressed.
Structural Problems
6.        Thailand's favorable performance during the last decade was
not without weaknesses. Income disparities between regions and between
rural and urban areas are substantial as Bangkok and the Central Region
have developed more rapidly than the rest of the country. The population
has grown by about 3 percent per year; as a result, the annual increment to
the labor force has risen by more than 50 percent in the last decade, the



- 3 -
dependency ratio is high, and the burden on the Government to provide
education, health, and other necessary services is heavy. In the past,
agricultural output increased largely because new land was put under culti-
vation rather than because productivity increased. However, available
evidence indicates that the supply of new land is being exhausted, popula-
tion pressure on land has already developed in some areas and tenancy
problems are becoming more serious than in the past. Expansion of the area
under cultivation has provided jobs for about half the new entrants to the
labor force, while industrial employment has grown slowly and still accounts
for only 7 percent of the work force. In the future, as free land suitable
for cultivation is exhausted, creating new jobs will be more difficult since
they will have to be generated by the intensification of agricultural
production and the rapid expansion of labor intensive industries.
Progress Toward Development Objectives & Recent Institutional Changes
7.        Thailand's Third Five-Year Plan (1972-76) attempted to deal
with the above structural problems. It included the following objectives:
reducing regional and rural-urban income disparities, increasing employ-
ment, intensification of agricultural production, and greater public
expenditure on education and other social services. Progress towards
these objectives was minimal under the Thanom-Prapass regime. The Govern-
ments which followed, however, have taken a number of steps directed
towards achieving these objectives. Public expenditures for education,
health and social services have almost doubled and expenditures on agri-
culture almost tripled in the period FY73-76. The Government's price
policy has allowed domestic agricultural prices to rise with international
prices, and the real per capita income of the 75 percent of the population
that is dependent on agriculture rose by about one-third over the last
four years. Through the tambon program $125 million was transferred to
village councils in FY75 to finance rural public works and create off-farm
employment and income. In the last two years, laws have also been passed
to reform agricultural land ownership, tenancy, and rents and to establish
a Marketing Organization for Farmers and a Farmers' Aid Fund. However,
formulation of detailed programs to implement many of these measures is
still necessary, and only the implementation over a longer period will
determine whether or not these promising first steps lead to lasting
results.
8.        During the Third Plan period, the population growth rate declined.
Although the extent of the decline is subject to debate, there is a justi-
fied optimism that in the long run Thailand can gain control over this
growth before the country becomes seriously burdened with an excessively
heavy population density. Thailand has a combination of a well-planned,
well-executed family planning program, a growing awareness of population
problems among influential leaders, and a cultural setting that offers a
favorable environment for fertility control. The acceptance rate is about
25 percent, which is the sixth highest rate in the developing world. The
Government intends to intensify its family planning efforts during the
Fourth Plan and may seek Bank assistance to help finance this program.



-4-
Development Prospects and the Fourth Plan (1977-81)
9.        Recent events have complicated long-term planning, and work on
the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) is not yet far advanced. The Govern-
ment presented a general policy statement and a preliminary project list
to a meeting of the Consultative Group for Thailand in December 1975. The
preliminary outline of the Fourth Plan reflects the emphasis which recent
governments have put on reducing social and economic disparities between
regions, income groups, and urban and rural areas. In order to achieve its
distributional objectives, Thailand must also adopt policies and programs
to accelerate growth to at least the 7 percent target announced at the
meeting.
10.       A greater effort than in the past will, however, be required
in order to achieve the above target. Political and economic uncertainty
could restrain private investment, particularly foreign investment.
Agricultural production increases, improvements in rural incomes, and
growth in agricultural exports will have to be generated by raising
yields rather than by extending the area under cultivation. A large public
expenditure program will be necessary to satisfy priority economic and
social needs and support rapid employment growth. Substantial effort
will be necessary to mobilize the domestic resources required to finance
the needed level of public expenditures. Finally, the availability of
foreign exchange could also become a serious constraint to growth later
in the decade, when Thailand's balance of payments position will be less
favorable than it has been in the recent past.
Balance of Payments and External Borrowing Program
11.       Although Thailand's import bill doubled between 1972 and
1974, higher export earnings and private capital inflows were sufficient
to meet foreign exchange requirements and increased reserves to six
months imports. In 1975, however, the overall balance of payments was
in deficit by about $150 million as the terms of trade (which began
declining in mid-1974) deteriorated further, overseas demand weakened due
to the international recession, and a smaller volume of agricultural
commodities was exported due to poor weather in the previous year. The
turnaround in the balance of payments reflects the transition from a
period of rapid growth in export earnings, led by unusually high commodity
prices, to a period of smaller increases. This situation is likely to
continue for the remainder of the decade, and rising import levels
required to maintain a large investment program in the Fourth Plan will
lead to a large external resource gap.
12.       A marked increase in the use of external capital for financing
public investment, which was relatively low in the past, will be necessary.
At the last Consultative Group meeting the Government indicated that it was
seeking about $3,500 million in loan commitments to finance its investment
program in the Fourth Plan. It also plans to borrow an additional $600
million from private sources and raised the first $100 million of this



amount in March 1976. Thailand's total debt service ratio has dropped from
18 percent in 1971 to below 12 percent in 1975 (of which just over two
percent was public debt service) and would remain under 15 percent throughout
the Fourth Plan. With the projected level of borrowing, public debt service
payments would not place an unreasonable burden on the balance of payments
provided the debt is incurred on reasonable terms. However, because of the
limited availability of official development assistance and long-term
private capital, the Government may encounter some difficulty in achieving
this level of borrowing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
13.       Thailand first borrowed from the Bank in 1950 and has received
34 loans amounting to $759.9 million, net of cancellations. Most of these
have been for transportation ($186.0 million), irrigation ($163.8 million)
and power ($166.0 million) with, in addition, one for a dual-purpose power
and irrigation project ($65.8 million). The remaining loans have been for
water supply ($55.0 million), telecommunications ($63.0 million), education
($21.3 million), industry ($13.0 million), rural development ($21.0 million)
and livestock ($5.0 million). Loans for rubber replanting ($50.0 million)
and education ($31.0 million) have been approved but not yet signed. In
addition, Thailand has received IDA credits of $19.5 million for education
and $12.5 million for irrigation improvement. In general, Bank-financed
projects have been carried out in accordance with expectations; implementa-
tion of those on which problems have earlier been reported is improving.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IFC investments, Bank loans and
IDA credits as of June 30, 1976, as well as notes on the execution of on-
going projects.
14.       The Bank is diversifying its lending program in Thailand.    In
the next few years a smaller proportion of lending is planned for transpor-
tation and power generation projects, while projects to support a broad
range of activities such as agriculture development, rural works and
infrastructure, family planning, education and small- and medium-scale
industries would account for about two-thirds of the proposed program.
Increasingly, projects are being selected to spread development benefits
outside the Central Plains area, and one of the main functions of the
Bank's Resident Regional Mission in Bangkok is to assist the Government
in developing projects which will achieve this. Our readiness to finance
some local costs in appropriate cases will enable the Bank to participate
more fully in projects in agriculture and the social sectors which would
have significant social benefits.



15.       In addition to the proposed loan to IFCT, loans for an agri-
cultural extension project, an irrigation project (Chao Phya II), and a
low income housing project in Bangkok are expected to be ready for consi-
deration by the Executive Directors in this fiscal year. Processing of a
number of other projects such as family planning, rural electrification
and industrial estates is also underway. In addition, the Government is
considering requesting a Bank loan to help finance preinvestment studies.
16.       As of June 30, 1976, Bank loans and IDA credits disbursed and
outstanding amounted to $319.7 million, representing about 21 percent of
the country's estimated total external debt and about 43 percent of esti-
mated public external debt. This is not excessive in view of Thailand's
modest overall public external debt (about 4.2 percent of GDP in 1975).
In addition, although the level of Bank commitments is expected to increase
over the next five years, the Bank Group's share is expected to decline
rapidly to about 16 percent of total external debt and 26 percent of total
public external debt. Servicing of the Bank debt in 1980 is projected to
account for about 8.2 percent of the total debt service and about 32 per-
cent of the country's public debt service; this compares with 8.4 percent
and 43 percent respectively in 1975.
17.       IFC has made two equity investments in the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand totalling $380,000 1/, two loans to and an investment
in the Siam Cement group totalling $32.08 million, and a loan of $300,000
to Concrete Products Ltd. Prospects for other IFC operations are reasonably
good; potential projects include a zinc mining and refinery project, and the
development of privately sponsored industrial estates. The Capital Markets
Department is considering an investment in a mutual fund management company
and has been invited to provide assistance to the Government Housing Bank.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
A. The Industrial Sector
18.       The industrial sector (manufacturing, mining and construction)
is the second largest in Thailand. In 1975, it accounted for 26 percent
of GDP (at 1962 constant prices), about 25 percent of total investment
and 7 percent of total employment. Manufacturing alone accounted for over
20 percent of GDP in 1975. In 1960, it accounted for less than 12 percent
of GDP and was oriented almost entirely toward producing basic consumer
1/ In February 1976 IFC sold its entire shareholding in IFCT to the Mitsui
Bank for US$640,000, realizing a profit of US$260,000 on the transaction.



goods. With substantial opportunities for import substi.ution and an
environment which encouraged investment, manufacturing output grew at an
annual average rate of around 12 percent between 1960 and 1969; as these
opportunities were exhausted, investment shifted sharply towards export
industries and grew at an even higher rate of 14 percent between 1970 and
1973. Between 1969 and 1974, manufactured exports increased from $34
million to $367 million, or from 4.8 percent of total merchandise exports
to 14.6 percent. The most important industries are food processing,
beverages, tobacco, textiles, apparel, transport equipment and petroleum
refining; together they account for 70 percent of value-added in the
sector. Manufacturing industries remain heavily concentrated around
Bangkok.
Industrial Investment
19.       Estimates for 1975 suggest that investment in manufacturing
industry has declined for the first time since 1971. In current prices
investment in manufacturing has grown from $155 million in 1967 to over
$500 million in 1975. The share of manufacturing in gross fixed capital
formation rose from 12.5 percent in 1967 to over 20 percent in 1974 but
dipped to around 18 percent in 1975; it has traditionally accounted fir
about one third of total annual expenditures on machinery and equipment.
As applications for investment permits have declined substantially in
1975, it is unlikely that expenditures on manufacturing investments will
exceed $1 billion over the two-year period 1976-77. The business climate
is expected to improve.
Industrial Employment
20.       At the end of 1974, the industrial sector employed about 1.4 mil-
lion persons or 7.9 percent of a total labor force estimated at 17.7 million.
Of these, about 0.9 million (5 percent of the labor force) were employed in
manufacturing. Industrial employment is presently concentrated in small
cottage type enterprises and in large firms employing more than 100 workers.
Currently, there are few small to medium industrial units (SMI) employing
between 10 and 100 workers to fill the gap between these two extremes;
such units probably account for under 5 percent of the total number of
enterprises, 10 percent of employment and 15 percent of value-added in
manufacturing. SMIs provide a promising vehicle for expanding and decen-
tralizing investment and employment opportunities at a reasonable capital
cost without necessarily sacrificing the objectives of productivity, effi-
ciency and competitiveness. IFCT has taken the initiative in launching a
study which would explore the dimensions of the SMI problem and evaluate
alternative approaches to tackling it.
Industrial Promotion
21.       The Government's strategy to promote industrial development
needs to be reviewed and refined. So far the Government has relied on
tax incentives and tariffs to promote industrial development and encour-
age private investment in priority areas. Investment incentives are



- 8 -
provided through the Board of Investment (BOI). These incentives are
designed to promote projects generating employment and using domestic raw
materials: within the range available, the most favorable incentives are
designed for export oriented industries and for industries in designated
development areas.
22.       In 1975 the Bank sponsored a study of the impact of existing
effective protection in Thailand, which encompassed a review of direct
tariff protection and investment incentives policies. The study revealed
that although, in general, these policies have not resulted in inefficiencies
or high costs, their net result has in fact favored industries producing for
domestic market rather than those producing for export. Moreover, signifi-
cant variations in applied protection levels were noted within and between
various industry groups for which there seemed to be no underlying rationale.
Frequent and uncoordinated changes in the application of tariffs, direct
controls on imports, exports and prices, registration and licensing policies,
and the case by case provision of incentives have results in both inefficient
administration and some inconsistencies in the Government's industrial promo-
tion policies. It has also resulted in a heavy administrative burden on the
BOI.
23.       Given the BOI's very broad scope of discretion and the importance of
sound decision-making on its part the Bank has recommended that the internal
evaluation capabilities of BOI be strengthened. The Government and BOI
readily accept the need for such measures. As a first step, they have
begun exploring avenues for grant assistance to finance a program of
studies which would focus on issues influencing coordinated industrial
development and on improved BOI operations. These studies would be
carried out on a schedule agreed with the Bank (Section 3.03 of the draft
Guarantee Agreement).
B. The Financial Sector
24.       The growth of Thai financial institutions and markets has not
kept pace with the diverse demands of a domestic economy increasing in its
sophistication. The emergence and rapid growth of finance companies in the
last five years and the presence of a large and pervasive "curb" market for
funds indicate that the present financial system is unable to meet the
needs of financial intermediation. At present, the system does not provide
sufficiently diverse opportunities for attracting financial savings in
instruments with maturities of over a year. Excessively heavy reliance is
placed on deposits with commercial banks and the Government Savings Bank
(GSB). The pace at which the financial system will develop in a more
desirable direction in the future depends on: (a) reducing the extent to



- 9 -
which commercial banks presently dominate all forms of intermediation, and
(b) encouraging the growth of a capital market and of long-term financing
institutions. At present, the largest institutional source of credit for
industry is the commercial banking sector. Lending from this sector is
generally to well-established borrowers and is heavily collateral oriented.
Fixed asset financing by commercial banks is generally provided through
overdrafts renewable annually.
Financial Sector Study
25.       The Bank of Thailand (BOT) has launched, with IMF assistance, a
study aimed at reviewing (a) the working of financial institutions, and
(b) the effectiveness of the instruments currently available to BOT to
control and direct financial institutions. The BOT expects that the
studies will help identify the means and measures necessary to (a) promote
an orderly growth of the "organized money market", (b) encourage sound
competition among financial institutions, and (c) promote greater effi-
ciency in the functioning of financial intermediaries. BOT is looking to
the Bank and IFC to examine the role and operations of Government supported
long-term credit institutions such as IFCT, the Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives, the National Housing Authority and the
Government Housing Bank in the course of appraising their activities for
loans or technical assistance.
Government's Role
26.       The Government is an active participant in furthering the evolution
of the Thai financial sector. It supports specialized lending institutions
in sectors such as industry, agriculture and housing and has thus accelerated
the flow of funds to priority purposes. With respect to industrial financing
in particular, the Government is actively supporting IFCT, the only special-
ized industrial credit institution in Thailand; has helped promote a
securities market by establishing the Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET);
and is considering participating in a Mutual Fund Co. being established
by IFCT. To encourage active interest in the stock market, the revenue code
has been amended to allow some tax exemptions on dividend income (income
derived from interest on bank deposits is tax-free). It is too early to
assess SET's performance, but it is expected that over time it will assist
in channelling additional resources for the industrial sector on appropriate
terms and provide domestic savers with alternative investment opportunities.
Interest Rates
27.       The interest rate structure in Thailand is governed by the com-
mercial banks' prime lending rate but its movement is constrained by
ceiling rates (15 percent for advances and 8 percent for deposits) set
by the Bank of Thailand. The prime rate, which has fluctuated around
12 percent for the past ten years, is established by the interbank agree-
ment of the Thai Bankers' Association. The deposit rate was 5 percent for
3-6 month deposits, 6 percent for 6-12 month deposits and 7 percent for



- 10 -
deposits of over 12 months until December 1975 when all deposit rates were
increased by 1 percent. Between 1966 and 1972, with an inflation rate
averaging about 2-3 percent, real interest rates on lending were in the
region of 9-10 percent while real yields on savings were on average 3-4
percent. In 1973-74, the rate of inflation peaked at 24 percent before
declining to 5 percent in 1975, resulting in a short period during which
real yields on loans and deposits were highly negative. There was no evi-
dence, however, that this situation adversely affected financial savings.
With inflation expected to level off at around 6 percent through the remain-
der of this decade, real yields and savings will be positive although some-
what lower than in the pre-1963 period, unless rates are moved upwards.
IFCT
28.       Since its establishment in 1959 and subsequent restructuring in
1963 IFCT has played an increasingly significant role in assisting the
development of the Thai industrial sector. Until 1974 its operations did
not account for a large share of industrial investment but its influence
extended beyond its own loans and investments. Over the past years, IFCT
has helped channel investment in the directions set by the Government's
overall industrial development priorities by actively promoting investments
outside the Central Region and in agro-industrial projects. IFCT's present
development strategy is geared toward: (a) further decentralization of
industrial investment; (b) providing finance for smaller projects in the
Bangkok area and for projects sponsored by less well-established investors
which cannot attract commercial bank financing; (c) providing finance for
new ventures requiring complex appraisal and promotional efforts; (d)
providing equity capital in support of its term lending; and (e) assisting
with further development of the capital market, particularly focusing on
widening the equity ownership base of industry. The proposed Bank loan
would support these and other IFCT investment activities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
29.       The Bank has been associated with IFCT since 1963, when at
the invitation of the Government, the Bank Group helped reorganize IFCT and
augment its resources. IFC took up 4,000 ($193,108) of an issue of 30,000
shares and the Bank made its first loan to IFCT of $2.5 million (370-TH).
Because of management problems and the reluctance of potential borrowers to
assume the foreign exchange risk, IFCT was able to use only $1.05 million
of that loan by the closing date in March 1968 and the balance was cancelled.
The Bank's first loan has been fully repaid. In 1971, IFC took up another
4,000 shares ($193,108). The Bank made a second loan to IFCT for $12.0
million (992-TH) in June 1974; its rate of commitment and disbursement has
exceeded expectations. As already noted, in February 1976, IFC sold all
its equity holdings in IFCT.



- 11 -
30.       In January 1976, IFCT assessed its needs for additional foreign
exchange resources in the light of its high rate of loan commitments and
requested the Bank to provide a third loan in support of its continuing
lending activities. A mission visited IFCT in February 1976 to appraise
its performance, future prospects and foreign exchange needs. The proposed
loan was negotiated in Washington on July 26 and 27, 1976. The Thai dele-
gation was led by H. E. Upadit Pachariyangkon, Thai ambassador to the
United States; Khun Waree Bongsvej and Khun Aswin Kongsiri represented
IFCT and Khun Kraisri Chatikavanij, the Government. A report entitled
"Appraisal of the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand" (No. 1157a-TH
dated August 10, 1976) is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. A loan and project summary is provided in Annex III.
Objectives
31.       IFCT is a privately-owned development finance company established
in 1959 for the purpose of promoting private industrial investment in
Thailand. Its main objectives are to assist in the establishment, expan-
sion and modernization of private industrial enterprises, and to encourage
the flow of equity capital, both foreign and domestic, to such enterprises.
The Act establishing IFCT authorizes it to provide financial and technical
assistance in almost any form. IFCT's policy statement contains the usual
guidelines for the conduct of its business along sound lines.
Ownership, Board, Management and Staff
32.        IFCT's initial share capital of $300,000 has been increased four
times and amounted to $7.5 million as of end-FY75. Share capital was last
increased by $2.5 million in September 1973. IFCT expects to increase it
again by $5 million this year. Of this amount, $2.75 million (issued to
existing shareholders, employees of IFCT and the Mutual Fund Co.) was fully
paid in as of July 31, 1975. On the advice of its underwriters, IFCT has
decided to defer the issue of the balance of $2.25 million to the general
public until December 1976. However, it has entered into firm selling
agreements with the underwriters. Share ownership is divided between
domestic and foreign shareholders with the latter accounting for 47.4 per-
cent of paid-in share capital as of December 31, 1975. Commercial banks
accounted for nearly 69 percent of the total shareholdings with the
government-owned Krung Thai Bank being the largest single shareholder
(accounting for 16.4 percent of outstanding shares). Other financial
institutions accounted for a further 16.1 percent of the shareholding
leaving a balance of only 14.9 percent which was owned by nonfinancial
companies (10.3 percent) and private individuals (4.6 percent).
33.        IFCT's Board of Directors comprises ten members including the
Chairman (traditionally the Government appointed director) and the General
Manager, ex-officio. Of the other nine directors, three represent foreign
shareholders and the remaining six represent domestic shareholders. An
Executive Committee, consisting of the Chairman, General Manager, and two



- 12 -
other directors (one representing foreign shareholders' interests), is
authorized to approve loans up to $750,000. It also screens all projects
before their presentation to the full Board.
34.       The present Chairman, Khun Sommai Hoontrakool, plays an active
role in guiding IFCT's affairs and lays particular stress on its developmen-
tal role. His ability and dynamism are a distinct asset to IFCT. IFCT's
present management team which includes the General Manager, two department
managers and two deputy managers, is well qualified. A new Deputy General
Manager is to be appointed by IFCT before September 30, 1976. Major
organizational changes were made by IFCT, in February 1976, to improve
operational efficiency. These changes, which include the establishment of
a department for long-term corporate planning and three branch offices, to
a large extent reflect the Bank's previous recommendations. At the end of
FY75, IFCT had a total staff of 163 representing a net increase of 13 staff
during the year. Professional staff accounted for 86 or just over half the
total. IFCT staff is generally of a good caliber with suitably diverse
professional backgrounds.
Policies and Procedures
35.       IFCT's basic operating guidelines are similar to those adopted by
most DFC's associated with the World Bank Group. The quality of IFCT's
project appraisal work is satisfactory and has shown consistent improvement
over the past two years. This achievement is especially notable in view of
the rapidly increased workload in 1974 and 1975 and the fact that IFCT's
borrowers do not provide information, especially on financial aspects, too
readily. With the last Bank loan IFCT began calculating economic rates of
return for all projects for which subloans exceeded $400,000 and/or the
total project cost exceeded $1.5 million regardless of subloan amounts.
IFCT intends to include economic rate of return calculations in its project
appraisals as a matter of course. IFCT has an exceptionally sound project
supervision system, with close follow-up being carried out during project
implementation and after commencement of commercial operations.
Foreign Exchange Risk and Interest Rate
36.       Until 1974, IFCT's foreign currency lending had been impeded by
its borrowers' reluctance to carry the foreign exchange risk when Baht
resources were freely convertible. In March 1974, a Foreign Exchange Risk
Agreement was signed between the Ministry of Finance and IFCT whereby,
without being totally relieved of possible losses as a result of foreign
currency realignments, IFCT could cover losses without serious financial
consequences. Under the agreement IFCT must set aside a provision equiva-
lent to 1.25 percent of that portion of its outstanding foreign debt
incurred after the date of the agreement. This provision consists of (a) a
0.25 percent fee to be paid by IFCT into a Claim Account in the name of the
Ministry of Finance which, although belonging to Government, remains with
IFCT and on which IFCT must pay interest at the rate of 6 percent per
annum, and (b) a 1.0 percent contribution toward a Foreign Exchange Fund.
Losses due to a realignment of currencies are chargeable first against the



- 13 -
Foreign Exchange Fund (up to 75 percent of the balance in the Fund) and the
balance, if any, against the Claim Account. The Ministry of Finance under-
takes to cover all losses in excess of the charges so made through advances
to IFCT. Such advances are free of interest and are repayable by IFCT at
the rate of only $50,000 equivalent per annum.
37.       Between 1966 and 1973, IFCT generally maintained its foreign cur-
rency lending rate at around 9.5 percent. In 1974 it moved this rate up
to 10.5 percent to cover the cost of providing for the foreign exchange
risk. Following discussions with the Bank's appraisal mission, IFCT again
increased its lending rate in May 1976 to 12.0 percent except for agro-
industry loans for which a one percent lower rate is charged. On the basis
of current interest rate charges IFCT would have a gross relending spread of
3.1 percent on the proposed Bank loan, which after deducting 1.25 percent for
foreign exchange risk coverage charges will leave IFCT with a net spread of
1.85 percent to cover administrative expenses, provisions and contribution
to profits. To improve the net spread IFCT intends to raise the interest
rate to 12.5 percent before July 1, 1977 if this increase is consistent with
prevailing interest rates at the time. At this level IFCT would realize a net
spread of 2.35 percent on the proposed loan. It has agreed to exchange views
with the Bank whenever it proposes to make changes in its interest rate and
other charges (Section 4.08 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Lending Operations
38.       IFCT's level of loan approvals in FY74 and FY75 considerably
exceeded previous expectations. From an average level of around $7.5 million
between FY70-73, net loan approvals jumped to an average annual level of
around $37.5 million between FY74-75, with approvals in those two years
exceeding total approvals between FY60-73. This increase is a consequence
of IFCT's willingness to finance industrial investments at a time when
commercial banks retrenched due to uncertainties in the national and inter-
national environment. Net approvals of nearly $39.3 million for 54 loans in
FY75 brought total loan approvals since IFCT's inception to nearly $130.0
million. As of December 31, 1975, IFCT had $67 million outstanding in 146
loans to 120 borrowers. The ratio of domestic to foreign currency lending
is about 40:60 representing a shift towards an increasing proportion of
foreign currency financing from FY71 onward. The average size loan is around
$650,000-700,000 and loan maturities average around six years. This increase
in operations was financed entirely by draw-downs on available loans from
the ADB, the Bank and the EXIM Bank of Japan. Domestic currency operations
were financed by additional issues of IFCT's own debentures and by the
extension of special rediscounting facilities from BOT.
39.       Lending operations, reflecting the location of Thai industry,
tend to be heavily concentrated in the Central Region. IFCT management
intends to step up efforts at dispersing its lending operations through
the establishment of branch offices (offices have been opened at Haat-Yai
in the South, at Khon-Kaen in the Northeast and at Lampang in the North),
and through the new project promotion section set up in its Research and



- 14 -
Planning Department. The loan portfolio is reasonably well diversified
by industry; four basic industries viz. food, textiles, chemicals and
nonmetallic minerals account for about 66 precent of total commitments.
IFCT's lending operations also reflect the thrust toward export orientation
in manufacturing which began in FY70. There is a fairly even split between
new and expansion projects in IFCT's financing. In the past, IFCT had been
financing a number of projects which were in a late stage of development,
at which time its ability to influence investment decisions was limited.
However, because of intensive subproject review, there have been very few
instances in which IBRD funds have been used to finance such operations.
To curb such operations IFCT's Board, in a recent resolution, has instructed
management to limit financing such operations to exceptional cases where
clear justification existed for doing so.
40.       The projects financed by IFCT during FY74-75 involve total invest-
ments of around $320 million and, on completion, are expected to generate
24,500 jobs resulting in an annual incremental payroll of about $22 million.
Incremental annual value-added by these projects is expected to amount to
nearly $127 million; they are also expected to result in net annual foreign
exchange earnings/savings of nearly $50 million. The subprojects financed
by IFCT in FY74 and FY75 were estimated to have ex ante economic rates of
return ranging from 12 percent to 80 percent (see paragraph 51).
41.       To improve the quality of its lending operations IFCT plans to
adopt the Project Monitoring System now being developed within the Bank
and has already participated in a pilot exercise towards this scheme.
Through FY74-76 IFCT has continued stepping up its promotional efforts with
its continuing program of industry studies and regional seminars; direct
project promotion through encouragement of joint ventures, and the establish-
ment of three branch offices and a special project promotion unit at head-
quarters. In addition it has launched a special study of small industry
development (see paragraph 20).
Financial Performance and Portfolio Quality
42.       On December 31, 1975, IFCT's total assets stood at $74 million
having increased by over 37 percent during the year, slightly less than the
40 percent growth recorded in 1974. Rapid asset growth over the past two
years reflects the stepped up level of lending operations; the proportion
of outstanding long-term loans in the asset base has risen from 78 percent
to 91 percent between FY73 and FY75. While outstanding long-term debt
increased by 115 percent between FY73 and FY75 (from $26.5 million to $57.5
million), IFCT's equity grew by only 23 percent (from $10.2 million to 12.6
million), the growth being accounted for by additions to reserves. As a
result IFCT's long-term debt/equity ratio rose from 2.9:1 in FY73 to 4.8:1
at end FY75, still well within the ceiling of 6:1 established under the
Bank's second loan to IFCT (992-TH). IFCT's liquidity position also
remains sound, the current ratio being 1.7 in FY75.



- 15 -
43.       The increasing volume of operations has had a salutary impact on
IFCT's financial performance. Net income for FY75 was $1.91 million rep-
resenting a 42 percent increase over the previous year; it has tripled from
FY71 levels. Income growth is attributable entirely to an increase in the
portfolio with increased interest charges being offset by increased financial
expenses resulting in a constant gross spread. Administrative expenses have
been maintained at the historical level of 1.5 percent of average total
assets. Increased profits and improved leverage since 1973 have brought the
return on average equity from 12.5 percent in 1973 to 16.1 percent in 1975.
44.       IFCT's loan, equity investment and guarantee portfolio are sound.
Arrears (principal and interest) on the loan portfolio, at the end of FY75,
amounted to $1.4 million or 2 percent of the outstanding portfolio. The
principal outstanding affected by overdue accounts amounted to $7.5 million
or 11 percent of the outstanding portfolio. About 2 percent of the out-
standing guarantee portfolio is in arrears ($60,000). The increase in its
arrears levels between FY74 and FY75 reflected temporary difficulties expe-
rienced by its borrowers in a difficult economic climate and does not represent
any structural weaknesses in the portfolio. In April 1976, IFCT informed the
Bank of actions taken on the one major account in arrears which resulted in a
significant improvement in the project's outlook and in IFCT's arrears position.
IFCT has made sufficiently prudent provisions for losses on doubtful accounts
based on a thorough review of each account.
Projected Resource Requirements and Financial Results
45.       IFCT expects to commit about $82 million in the period FY76 to
FY77 in loans and equity investment; $24 million equivalent in domestic
currency and $58 million in foreign exchange. Considering the level of
approvals in 1974-75, which have outpaced all previous expectations and
IFCT's pipeline of projects, the forecast takes into account the present
slackening of investment and appears realistic. IFCT's operational projec-
tions are generally in line with overall business expectations and, provided
broader assumptions about the investment climate hold good, they should be
achievable.
46.       IFCT's local currency resources, should be sufficient to enable
it to undertake the commitments it has projected. On the foreign resources
side IFCT is expected to exhaust its available untied funds on a commitment
basis by around September-October 1976. On the basis of its operational
projections, the proposed Bank loan of $25 million should last IFCT until
around March 1978 on an approval basis (or three to six months beyond on a
commitment basis). IFCT's tied resources, of which it had over $17.6 mil-
lion available for further approval at end FY75 should suffice until around
the end of 1977.



- 16 -
47.       Spurred largely by growth in its long-term loan assets, total
assets are expected to increase by 54 percent in 1976 to $113 million and
at an average annual rate of nearly 15 percent thereafter to $224 million
in 1980. To finance this increase, long-term debt outstanding is expected
to climb by 53 percent in 1976 to $88 million and by 18 percent per year
thereafter to $171 million in 1980. Over the projection period (1976-80),
increases in net worth will be attributable entirely to a reserves build-up.
Reserves are expected to grow by 31 percent in 1976 to $6.7 million and by
a much higher rate averaging 42 percent annually between 1977 and 1980 to
$27 million. In 1980 reserves are expected to account for 68.5 percent of
net worth compared with 40.1 percent in 1975. As a result of the increase
in reserves the long-term debt equity ratio is expected to decline to 4.4:1
in 1980 after rising to a peak of 5:1 in 1977. It has been agreed that IFCT
will maintain a debt equity ratio of no more than 6:1 (Section 4.06 of the
draft Loan Agreement). The liquidity position is expected to remain comfort-
able throughout with the current ratio reaching a high of 2.1:1 in 1976
(caused by the increase in short-term holdings due to receipts from the equity
increase) and a low of 1.4:1 in 1977.
48.       Net income is expected to grow by 27 percent to $2.5 million
in 1976 and by 57 percent to $3.9 million in 1977 when the impact of the
increase in interest rates on a sizeable part of the portfolio is felt,
thereafter its growth is expected to decline to 13.5 percent in 1980 when
net income is expected to be $8.1 million. However, net income as a percent-
age of average total assets is expected to decline in 1976 (from 3 percent to
2.6 percent) and then rise gradually to 3.8 percent in 1980. Expected levels
of profitability would result in an increase of the return to equity from
15.3 percent in 1976 to 22.3 percent in 1980. IFCT is expected to raise its
dividend rate by 0.5 percent annually from 10 percent in 1975 to 12 percent
in 1979 in an effort to make its shares more attractive to the market. A
reasonably sound cash flow position is expected to be maintained throughout
and the debt service coverage ratio expected to remain at well above 1.6.
Proposed Loan
49.       The proposed loan of $25 million would enable IFCT to finance,
over an 18 month period, the foreign exchange costs of capital goods required
by eligible industrial, agroindustrial, mining, shipping, tourist and other
enterprises. No subloan extended by IFCT using the proceeds of the pro-
posed Bank loan may exceed $3.0 million (Section 2.02 (a) of the draft Loan
Agreement). IFCT would be authorized to make individual subloans of up to
$750,000 without the Bank's prior approval, up to an aggregate amount of
$10.0 million (Section 2.02 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement). It is expected
that about half of the number of subprojects and three quarters of the amount
committed would require prior approval by the Bank. Expenditures made prior
to 90 days of the date of receipt by the Bank of each subloan application
would not be eligible for financing (Section 2.02 (c) of the draft Loan
Agreement). The proposed Bank Loan would be repaid in conformity with a
schedule based on the aggregate of the amortization schedules of IFCT sub-
loans (Section 2.08 of the draft Loan Agreement), which would have a maximum
repayment period of fifteen years, including up to three years of grace.



- 17 -
Justification and Risks
50.       IFCT has, since the early 1970s, rapidly developed into a sound
institution which applies rational project selection policies and procedures.
Its management and staff are of good caliber. As a private institution with
close connections with the Government it plays a unique role in encouraging
private sector investment in line with the overall industrial development
priorities of the Government. It is pursuing a sound development strategy
and has had more than moderate success in taking the first steps toward
achieving fairly difficult objectives. From a review of its pipeline of
projects (see paragraph 51), it appears that IFCT will continue to pursue
these goals actively. It has excellent rapport with the Government and is
developing further its relations with the financial and industrial communi-
ties. In an environment not favorably inclined towards accepting the dis-
cipline of thorough project appraisal and supervision, IFCT continues to do
an effective job of getting clients to accept such discipline, although the
task has proven to be strenuous and progress has been gradual. It has played
a leading role in the development of the securities market and its lending
and equity investment operations have increased beyond expectations. These
achievements notwithstanding, IFCT plans to continue to upgrade the quality
of its staff, diversify its activities, particularly in encouraging smaller
scale industrial development, and has sought further support and assistance
from the Bank. The availability of Bank resources and support for IFCT have,
in the past, significantly helped its institutional growth. The proposed
loan would enable IFCT to continue its growth along sound lines, while
contributing to the development of Thailand's industrial sector. Project
risks are no greater than can normally be expected with operations of this
type.
51.       Internal economic rates of return on IFCT financed projects have
varied between 12 percent and 80 percent with the heaviest concentration
around 30 percent. Internal financial rates of return have ranged between
12 percent and 42 percent with the bulk of the projects having returns of
around 25 percent. The last Bank loan to IFCT for US$12 million has been
utilized in a satisfactory manner, having gone toward financing 22 diverse
projects with subloans varying in size from $49,000 to $2.7 million. 1/
These projects are quite diverse in nature; they include sugar refining,
textiles and garments manufacturing, chemicals (industrial acids) manufac-
ture, steel products, plastics, ceramics and the manufacture of electrical
appliances. IFCT's pipeline contains a number of projects in these indus-
tries and includes, in addition, pulp and paper processing, vehicle com-
ponent manufacture, and food processing. Economic rates of return, calculated
for 14 of these projects have ranged between 15 percent and 80 percent with a
weighted average economic rate of return of 46 percent. Financial ratfs of
return for all 22 projects ranged from 14 percent to 41 percent with ai
weighted average rate of return of 19 percent. These rates of return Fre
satisfactory. While the specific projects to be financed under the pr6posed
loan have not yet been finally determined it is expected that they will yield
similar returns to those financed under the previous loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 702-TH    Third Bangkok Port Project; $12.5 Million Loan of August 6,
1970; Effective Date: November 6, 1970; Closing Date:
original, July 31, 1974; current, December 31, 1976
The project is ninety percent completed and is scheduled to
be finished by July 1976. Construction progress is satisfactory, though
somewhat behind the original schedule. The civil engineering work was let
on a fixed-price contract. Present estimated total project cost is, how-
ever, $29 million compared with the appraisal estimate of $21 million.
Cost overruns have arisen out of changes in foreign exchange rates, and
the Government's decision to compensate contractors working on fixed-price
contracts, for overall increases in construction costs after June 1974.
The Port Authority's financial situation is sound.
Loan 790-TH     South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project; $27 Million Loan
of November 11, 1971; Effective Date: January 27, 1972;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976
Project completed on schedule. Costs have increased by
about 13 percent due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Loan 822-TH     Second Education Project (Kasetsart University); $15.4 Million
Loan of May 24, 1972; Effective Date: August 22, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
Project implementation is about 18 months behind schedule
due to late appointment of campus master planner, late Cabinet approval
of executive architect's fees and, more recently, delays by the executive
architects in preparing adequate plans and specifications on schedule.
The causes of delays have now been overcome. In spite of late appointment
of the campus master planner and executive architects, the campus masterplan
and architectural plans have now been completed. Site development works for
the Kamphaengsaen Campus and construction began in March 1976, civil works
are expected to be completed by mid-1978. Contracts for equipment, valued at
$1.6 million, were awarded in August 1975. Implementation of the technical
assistance program is well underway. Project costs are expected to exceed the

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to

of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

appraisal estimate by about $8 million due to cost overruns for civil works.
The Government has made budgetary provisions to meet the cost overruns.
Disbursements, currently $2.7 million, are expected to reach $7.5 million
by the end of FY77.
Loan 864-TH    Telecommunications Project; $37 Million Loan of December 5,
1972; Effective Date: March 1, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The project is one year behind schedule but is now moving
forward satisfactorily and it should be practicable for TOT to overcome
some delays. Procurement action is well advanced and equipment deliveries
are in progress. Increased prices have required TOT to rephase its
project financing and to redistribute some foreign costs between Loan
864-TH and the Japanese credit. Reallocation of Loan 864-TH has been
approved. New tariffs, which came into effect in September 1975, are
expected to generate about 20 percent more revenues annually which will
help TOT finance its program.
Loan 870-TH   Fifth Highway Project; $28.6 Million Loan of December 26, 1972;
Effective Date: March 26, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Works under the project have been divided into nine contracts
of which four have been completed. Work on the remaining five contracts was
interrupted because the rapid increases in cost led to financial problems for
the contractors since, despite the Bank's recommendation, the contracts
provided only for costs escalation on petroleum products while costs of
materials, labor, equipment, and spare parts also escalated rapidly. One
contractor resumed work after renegotiating the contract prices with the
Government. The other four contracts were terminated by agreement between
the Government and the contractors; new bids were obtained for completing
the works, contracts were awarded and work has been resumed. Because of
higher prices in the bids for completing unfinished work, total cost of
the project is expected to be around $75 million, or about 28 percent above
the appraisal estimate, with Government financing the overruns. In spite of
these difficulties the project is likely to be completed no more than one year
beyond the original schedule.
Credit 369-TH Third Education Pro-ject; $19.5 Million Credit of April 11,
1973; Effective Date: August 8, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Project implementation remains about 12 months behind sche-
dule. Delays of the teacher training component have been caused by weak
project management, overcommitment of the MOE design offices, lengthy and
cumbersome approval procedures, temporary lack of funds to cover cost
increases resulting from inflation and late recruitment of technical
assistance. A major reorganization of project implementation is expected;



ANNEX II
Page 5
this will mitigate delays. The project problems are also being overcome.
Architectural plans have been completed. The project management and
procurement procedures will also be improved through the proposed fourth
education project. Adequate provisions have been made to meet the
expected cost overruns and noticeable progress was achieved in civil
works, procurement and technical assistance. About 70 percent of the
total civil works contracts and 30 percent of the total furniture and
equipment contracts have been signed. Ten technical assistance experts
are in place and 72 Thais have been sent abroad for training under the
project, representing over 60 percent of the revised and reduced technical
assistance program. Project costs are now estimated at $58.0 million, 49
percent above the appraisal estimate. Actual disbursements reflect
delayed implementation; they amount to $1.7 million, but are increasing
at an accelerated rate.
Credit 379-TH Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project; $5.5 Million
Credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: August 23, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project is expected to be completed by June 1977 as scheduled,
even though the progress in 1976 was less than forecast. Until recently,
project construction and disbursements were in line with appraisal estimates.
In 1976, force account construction continued satisfactorily but a plan to
employ contractors for on-farm development has been deferred until the
1976/77 working season. A project extension service has been set up and
is operating satisfactorily.
Loan 898-TH    Fourth Railways Project; $15 Million Loan of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: September 28, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project is behind schedule by about 14 months, mainly due to
slow procurement. All material except the rails has been ordered, and a
major part received. The estimated project cost is now about $19 million
higher than the appraisal estimate, the increase being mainly in local
cost. Passenger traffic continues to grow and was about 22 percent above
appraisal forecast in 1974/75. Freight traffic has grown only marginally
and is lower than anticipated (88 percent of appraisal forecast in 1974/75).
Substantial increases in tariffs for freight and passenger traffic were
introduced in October/November 1975 and are expected to lead to significant
improvements in the financial situation. Even so, with increasing cost of
wages, fuel and material, the SRT is not likely to achieve the prescribed
rate of return of 2 percent in 1975/76. Postponement of the Closing Date
to December 31, 1977 may be necessary.

Credit 461-TH Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project; $7 Million Credit
of February 19, 1974; Effective Date: October 7, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project has fallen behind schedule through delays in appoint-
ing consultants and in procuring earthmoving equipment for construction
of tertiary canals. This is likely to postpone completion of the project
by about one year. Decisions on the award of equipment contracts have now
been made, and the equipment should be delivered in time for the 1976/77
construction season. Progress in rehabilitation of main canal systems has
been satisfactory although somewhat behind schedule. The estimated project
cost is $16.7 million, or about 32 percent over the appraisal estimate.
In part, the increased cost is due to price inflation being higher than
foreseen at appraisal. Also, detailed mapping has shown more deficiencies
in the existing irrigation facilities than were apparent at appraisal.
Loan 977-TH    Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric Project; $75 Million Loan of
April 15, 1974; Effective Date: June 14, 1974; Closing
Date:. December 31, 1980
Construction of the project is slightly ahead of schedule. Based
on the recent sector review, it appears that the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand's (EGAT) financial position may become difficult,
unless tariffs are raised. This and other sector issues are being reviewed
in a sector report, which will be discussed with the Government in October
1976.
Loan 992-TH    Second Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT)
Project; $12.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1974; Effective
Date: September 4, 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The full amount of the $12 million loan has been committed.
The commitment was more rapid than originally estimated. Disbursements have
also been very satisfactory; as of June 30, 1976 total disbursements amounted
to $8.9 million. Since June 1974 when the loan was made, IFCT's operations
and financial condition have continued to be satisfactory.
Loan 1021-TH   Bangkok Water Supply Project; $55 Million Loan of June 28,
1974; Effective Date: December 2, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Owing to considerable delays in contract awards, some of which
have been retendered, the project completion may be delayed by about 12
months beyond the original schedule, i.e. until mid-1979. Consequently,
disbursements are lagging behind the earlier estimates but no change in
the Closing Date seems necessary at this time. Financial performance of
MWWA continues to be less than satisfactory. Only about half the water
produced is billed to the consumers. The Borrower has asked its consul-
tants to evaluate its Leakage Control Program and is taking steps to
improve its billing and collection of revenue. Proposals for increase
in tariffs are also receiving Government's consideration.

Loan 1149-TH   Phitsanulok Irrigation Project; $95 Million Loan of
July 25, 1975; Effective Date: October 31, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
Due to delays in engaging consultants, now resolved, the-start
of construction of the major works has been delayed by about a year. How-
ever, the on-farm works are proceeding on schedule, some urgently needed
canal and drainage works have been constructed, and an effective extension
service has been established. The consultants are now concentrating on the
detailed engineering and preparation of tender documents for the diversion
dam and main canals.
Loan 1198T-TH Northeast Thailand Rural Development Project; $21 Million
(Third Window) Loan of February 27, 1976; Effective Date:
June 29, 1976; Closing Date: June 30,1981
Preliminary project activities are proceeding satisfactorily.
Negotiations are in progress for consultants for the rural roads component.
Procurement equipment for the rural electrification and water supply com-
ponents is proceeding and a start has been made on a pilot project for
land settlement. Consultants are about to be engaged to design the
buildings required for the extension component while progress on the
upland crop research component is satisfactory.
Loan 1199T-TH Livestock Development Project; $5.0 Million of February 27,
1976; Effective Date: May 25, 1976; Closing Date: June 30,
1976
The project is off to a good start. The pasture development
program is well underway, and there is sufficient seed for distribution
to villages. Bids have been called for the supply of cattle, frozen
semen and vehicles. Also early implementation of the technical assis-
tance component provided by the Government of New Zealand is satisfactory.
