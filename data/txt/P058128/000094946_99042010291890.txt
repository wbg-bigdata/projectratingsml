KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, POST, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:        Government of the Kingdom of Morocco.
Amount:          EUR 85,210,000 (US$101 million equivalent), including standard front-end fee of 1%.
Terms:           Standard amortization term, grace period, and interest rate for a fixed-rate EUR single-
currency loan with expected disbursement in two tranches over a period of nine months;
closing date: December 31, 2000.
Objectives:      The loan supports the implementation of a comprehensive package of pro-competitive
reforms in the telecommunications, post, and information technology (IT) sectors designed
to increase the competitiveness of the Moroccan private sector, to broaden access to
communications services to the poor, particularly in rural areas, and to facilitate Morocco's
transition to a global, information-based economy. In telecommunications, the primary
objective of the loan is to promote increased competition, greater private participation and
investment, and autonomous regulation. With respect to postal services, the operation seeks
to increase the competitiveness of service provision and to ensure that public service
obligations are adequately defined, financed, and met. The loan also supports the
development of a national strategy aimed at facilitating Morocco's integration into the
global information society.
Description:     The operation  supports the  adoption  of measures in  six  specific  areas: (i)
telecommunications liberalization; (ii) telecommunications regulation; (iii) privatization of
the incumbent telecommunications operator; (iv) access to telecommunications services by
poor and remote households; (v) competitiveness of postal services; and (vi) development of
a national IT strategy. A policy matrix detailing the specific actions supported by the
operation is presented in Annex III.
Benefits:        The Moroccan private sector will be a major beneficiary of competitive telecommunications,
post, and IT services. The service industry, in particular, which accounts for an increasingly
important share of GDP in most developing economies, stands to benefit from a broader
array of competitively priced communication and IT services. The project will address some
of the needs of poor and remote households by increasing their access to communication and
IT services, a critical factor for developing local economic activities. In addition, the reforms
supported by the loan will bring substantial revenues to the Treasury (higher taxes levied on
enlarged telecommunications and IT sectors, the award of new telecommunications licenses
and the privatization of the incumbent telecommunications operator).
Risks:           The main risk associated with the implementation of the Government program is the reversal
of some key policy measures, notably: (a) the introduction of competition in the
telecommunications sector; and (b) the strengthening of the regulator's autonomy. Other less
serious but still significant risks for the operation stem from the complexity of some of the
measures to be implemented.
Risk mitigation:   The adoption of a new legal and regulatory framework in 1997/98 and the attached Letter of
Sector Development Policy (Annex II) demonstrate the Government's commitment to the
reform program. Also, the general consensus in favor of the program, which particularly



ii
benefits the private sector, makes a reversal of Government policies unlikely. A
comprehensive assistance package funded by the EU will help ensure the sustainability of
the reform program by strengthening the regulator's capacity to successfully implement
complex reform measures.
Poverty category: The loan supports a program of targeted interventions aimed at facilitating the access of
poor and remote households to telecommunications, postal, and 1T services.



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED TELECOMMUNICATIONS, POST,
AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ADJUSTMENT LOAN
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Telecommunications, Post, and Information Technology Adjustment Loan (TPI-SAL) to the Kingdom of
Morocco in the amount of EUR 85.21 million (US$101 million equivalent). It is a single currency, fixed
rate loan with a repayment schedule of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years. The proceeds of the
loan would be made available in two tranches. Measures required for release of the first tranche (EUR
42.44 million; 49.81% of the loan amount) have been adopted, and the first tranche would be released
upon loan effectiveness. Measures required for release of the second tranche (EUR 42.77 million; 50.19%
of the loan amount) are expected to be met over a period of 9 to 12 months after Board presentation. The
African Development Bank (ADB) has prepared the TPI-SAL jointly with the Bank and is contributing
parallel financing in the amount of 80 million Units of Account (US$113 million equivalent), with
disbursement in two tranches also, predicated upon the adoption of the same sets of measures. The
European Union has also been closely associated with the preparation of the reform program and has
approved a substantial technical assistance program to facilitate its implementation. The project has been
prepared jointly with all the main stakeholders in Morocco.'
1. INTRODUCTION
2.     The TPI-SAL would support the overall objective of the Government reform program to
accelerate Morocco's integration into the global information economy. Access to competitively priced
and efficient communication services and information technology (IT)2 determines to a large extent the
ability of economies to grow, create jobs, and reduce social disparities. The service sector, which is
heavily dependent upon communications and IT, accounts for an increasing share of GDP in most
economies, while the IT industry itself is emerging as a major source of growth, job creation, and export
earnings in those economies. Adequate provision of telecommunications, postal, and IT services to poor
and remote households also constitutes a powerful means to reduce social exclusion and to broaden the
scope of economic opportunities provided outside of the main cities.
H. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT
A.   Political Context
3.     Morocco has recently achieved substantial political liberalization. Following elections in
November 1997, King Hassan II appointed Abderrahmane Youssoufi, the leading opposition figure and a
onetime exile, as Prime Minister in February 1998. Mr. Youssoufi heads a Government backed by a
seven-party center-left coalition, the Koutla, which holds 102 of the lower chamber of parliament's 325
seats. The alternance Government marks the first time in independent Morocco's 42-year history that the
Including: Ministere Charge des Affaires Generales du Gouvernement; Ministere de I 'Economie et des Finances; Ministere
du Secteur Public et de la Privatisation; Secretariat d'Etat Charge' de la Poste et des Technologies de lI 'nformation; Agence
Nationale de Reglementation du Secteur des Telecommunications (ANRT); Itissalat al-Maghrib (IAM-the incumbent
telecommunications operator in Morocco); Barid AI-Maghrib (BAM-the postal agency); and representatives from the private
sector.
2 The term information technology refers to the broad range of technologies that transmit, store, and manipulate information
(voice, data, images) electronically, generally in digital format, as well as related software and services.



2
opposition has had the opportunity to govern. It also marks a break from the recent succession of'
technocratic, "transitional" Governments, although the alternance Government has re-appointed the
Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Interior, Islamic Affairs and Justice.
4.    The alternance Government exemplifies the overhaul of Morocco's political institutions, spurred
on in large measure by the King. An amended Constitution, adopted in September 1996, responded to
long-standing calls for a return to direct election by universal suffrage of members of the House of
Representatives, as well as for making Government more accountable to Parliament. Under the new
constitution, Parliament is composed of a directly-elected 325-seat House of Representatives and a 270-
member upper House of Counselors (representatives of chambers of commerce, labor unions, and local
communities). The State's unity and sovereignty continue to be embodied in the Monarchy. The new
Constitution paved the way for adoption prior to the November 1997 elections of a "joint declaration of
the administration and the political parties", whereby the previous transitional Government undertook to
ensure fair and transparent elections while the political parties undertook to abide by the rules of the
electoral process and its results.
5.    The alternance Government's general economic and social program balances: (i) prudence in
macroeconomic and fiscal management; (ii) reforms to improve public sector performance; (iii) measures
to harness the potential for private-sector-led growth; and (iv) the need for broad-based human and social
development, particularly in the country's least developed areas. The Government has already sent
important policy signals confirming its commitment to fiscal discipline. Shortly after assuming office, in
the face of a widening 1997/98 deficit, it took steps to contain the deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP. The
1998/99 budget provided for a similar level of deficit (3.6 percent of GDP, with execution thus far on
track), despite pressures that might otherwise have raised it to nearly 5 percent of GDP. The Government
has also sought to reassure the domestic and international financial and business communities of its
commitment to market oriented policies economic liberalism, and has shown continuity in taking forward
the legislative agenda initiated by its predecessor, with good initial results.
B.   Economic Performance
6.    Following rapid growth in the latter half of the 1980s, the Moroccan economy's performance has
slowed since the early 1990s (Table 11.1). In the late 1980s, growth was supported by a forceful
adjustment program that devalued the Dirham, substantially reduced trade protection, and cut the fiscal
deficit. GDP grew at an annual average rate of 4.4 percent, with non-agricultural GDP growth reaching
over 6 percent in 1988 and 1990. These rates were achieved with relatively modest investment levels
(around 23 percent of GDP), but with substantial increases in the efficiency of investment. Growth was
also driven by exports, which grew at an impressive 9 percent per year over the period, with a strong
surge in manufacturing exports. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment (FDI) also grew exponentially,
from only US$1 million in 1986 to US$317 million in 1991.
7.    The reduction in average annual growth to well below 3 percent in the 1990s partly reflects
greater frequency of drought as well as slower growth in Morocco's principal trading partners. But it also
reflects enduring structural problems. In the absence of deep-rooted sectoral and public management
reforms, the fiscal deficit has remained around 3-4 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, public expenditure
patterns have become increasingly rigid (with the government wage bill, together with interest payments,
absorbing around 65-70 percent of revenues), to the detriment of public spending on infrastructure and the
social sectors. Further, since the adoption of a nominal exchange rate peg in 1991 (whereby the Dirham's
value was held fixed relative to that of a basket of trading-partner currencies), Morocco's currency has
appreciated by some 15 percent in real terms, despite a substantial decline in inflation. Together with real
depreciation in competitor economies, this appreciation has adversely affected export growth.

8.     Structural and institutional reforms have continued to be implemented in the 1990s, but arguably
with less momentum than in the late 1980s. Tax administration has been improved, the financial sector
has been deregulated and modernized, and a limited but successful privatization program has been
implemented. Trade liberalization has also continued, most recently with the conclusion of an Association
Agreement with the European Union (EU), which calls for the elimination of tariffs for all European
industrial products over the next 12 years. The business environment for the private sector has also been
improved, although structural constraints still inhibit firms' competitiveness, underscoring the need for
profound institutional reforms.
9.     Following 1995's historic drought, GDP growth rebounded to 12 percent in 1996 but fell again to
negative 2.2 percent in 1997, once more reflecting poor rainfall; agricultural value-added declined by 26
percent while non-agricultural growth held at around 3 percent. Tight monetary policy and low increases
in import prices helped to reduce inflation from 3 percent in 1996 to 1 percent in 1997. In the balance of
payments, the current account deficit improved to 0.3 percent of GDP (from 1.7 percent in 1996),
reflecting faster growth in phosphate and jobbing trade exports, and slower growth in imports. Even more
significantly, foreign investment more than doubled to an all-time high of almost US$1.2 billion as a
result of large direct investment by multinationals and the sale of a major state-owned enterprise.

and expenditures increased by around one percentage point of GDP in 1997/98, owing in part to higher
tax revenues, the proceeds of a major electricity concession, and larger expenditure on the wage bill (from
10.8 percent of GDP in 1996/97 to 11.3 percent in 1997/98). Domestic financing of the deficit increased
from 4.9 percent of GDP in 1996/97 to 5.4 percent in 1997/98. This reflected a continuation of the
Treasury's policy of tapping the domestic market in order to reduce its exposure to foreign debt, which had
gradually declined from 55 percent of GDP in 1991 to 40 percent in 1996. The Treasury also began an
initiative in mid-1996 to manage external debt more actively through private and public debt-equity
conversion, refinancing, and pre-payment which has amounted to some US$900 million of external debt.
Non-government investment remained stagnant at 16 percent of GDP in 1997. Coupled with roughly
stable government investment, this placed limits on growth potential.
C.   Economic Outlook, Risks, and Financing Requirements
11.    Estimates for 1998 and Medium-Term Outlook. The economy is estimated to have grown by
6.3 percent in 1998, reflecting a rebound of agricultural output and steady non-agricultural growth, driven
by buoyant tourist and phosphate sectors. This solid growth has had a positive impact on private
investment, resulting in an increase in the overall investment ratio of close to one percent of GDP. The
current account deficit is estimated to have deteriorated slightly from 0.3 to 0.4 percent of GDP, and
3 Morocco's fiscal year cycle (July I-June 30), which until 1996 coincided with the calendar year, was changed to increase the
capacity for gearing the annual budget to the agricultural output cycle (knowledge of winter rainfall allows more refined
harvest projections by the time budget preparation is finalized.) The budget data presented in Table 1.2 are fiscal year data,
but calendar year data do not present a significantly different picture.

exports (including net jobbing trade exports) are forecast to grow at 5.6 percent in dollar terms (3.9
percent in real terms).
12.    Based on the 1998/99 Finance Law, the fiscal stance is planned to remain roughly unchanged; the
authorized deficit for the fiscal year is 3.6 percent of GDP. Budgetary revenues, which appear to have
been prudently forecast, are programmed to increase by over 7 percent relative to 1997/98, but include 1.5
percent of GDP in one-time revenue sources. The authorized increase in budgetary expenditures (8
percent relative to 1997/98) is driven largely by a 7.7 percent increase in the wage bill, one-time
expenditure in support of the liquidation of Charbonnages du Maroc (CdM), and the financial
restructuring program of Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA). As discussed below, the
borrowing requirement amounts to a little over 3 percent of GDP, slightly lower than that for 1997/98,
and the mix between domestic and external financing is expected to shift towards the latter.

13.    Preliminary estimates indicate that the execution of the 1998/99 budget will be broadly in line
with the provisions of the Finance Law. The deficit is now forecast to be slightly lower than the
authorized amount. Revenues from the fiscal amnesty have exceeded expectations, making it likely that
the overall revenue target will be achieved, while recurrent expenditures may come in at slightly under
the budgeted figure, owing to savings on domestic debt interest payments. On the financing side,
privatization receipts appear likely to fall short of the targeted amount, while arrears have been repaid on
a large scale.
14.    Beyond the current fiscal year, the macroeconomic outlook hinges on effective implementation of
the Government's medium-term program as well as on favorable exogenous factors. The Government's
program targets a gradual increase in GDP growth to 5.5 percent by 2002, underpinned by a gradual rise
in investment to above 24.5 percent of GDP (from 21.6 percent in 1998) as well as by greater efficiency



6
of investment, reflected in a declining incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR).4 Of the projected three-
percentage-point increase in the overall investment ratio, increased domestic private investment is
expected to contribute about 1.7 percentage points of GDP, public investment about 0.8 percentage points
(assumed to be directed to growth-and equity-enhancing programs), and foreign direct investment (FDI)
about 0.5 percentage points. Consistent with this scenario, the projected fiscal stance generates additional
public savings of nearly 3 percent of GDP by 2002/03. Rising budgetary savings enable a progressive
reduction in the budget deficit, from 3.6 percent of GDP in fiscal year 1998/99 to under 2 percent by
fiscal year 2001/02, releasing resources for private investment. Declining deficit financing requirements
are projected gradually to reduce the public debt-to-GDP ratio and put public finances on a more
sustainable path.
15.    At the time of writing, the new Finance Law for the 1999/2000 fiscal year was still under
preparation and intensive discussion. While little specific information was yet available, the Bank has
received assurances that, despite mounting pressures by several government departments and groups in
society to expand spending, the next budget will follow the direction laid down in the Government's
program in terms of continued consolidation of the overall fiscal stance and the adequacy of expenditure
allocations for key social programs (e.g., rural water supply). Nevertheless, there remains some
uncertainty regarding the extent to which the next budget will hold down the government wage bill and
initiate structural measures to bring about a sustained medium-term increase in budgetary savings.
16.    The higher growth rates and investment ratios projected over the medium term are underpinned
by export growth that is projected to rise to over 8 percent a year by the end of the period. Together with
planned structural reforms to enhance Morocco's external competitiveness, the stimulus for exports is
expected to come from a resurgence of growth in Europe, Morocco's principal market. Also projected
over the medium term is continuing low inflation, underpinned by tight monetary policy (which does
however allow for adequate growth in credit to the private sector), preventing real appreciation of the
Dirham. In addition to targeting the nominal GDP growth rate for broad money in order to maintain price
stability, monetary policy will allow continued expansion of credit to the private sector in line with GDP
as credit to the Treasury is reduced and foreign assets are stabilized. Additional resources to support a
higher rate of private investment will come from non-banking sources, such as the stock market and non-
bank financial institutions, which now constitute one of the more sophisticated capital markets in the
region. In parallel, FDI is projected to increase from 1.3 percent of GDP in 1998 to about 1.9 percent by
2002.
17.    Risk Factors. The medium-termn economic outlook is subject to four main risk factors: drought,
external shocks, inadequate private investment, and slippage in the fiscal stance vis-a-vis the
Government's intentions. The frequency of drought appears to have increased in the 1990s, causing large
year-on-year swings in agricultural value added and overall GDP growth. Drought has not been factored
in the medium-term outlook. Its timing and intensity are inherently difficult to forecast, and its overall
impact appears to be transitory in nature and limited to the share of agriculture in GDP. Analysis of the
budgetary impact of past droughts points to a limited effect on absolute budget figures, although it can
affect ratios expressed in terms of shares of GDP because of fluctuations in the latter.
18.    Potentially damaging external shocks would include higher international interest rates, an
economic slowdown in Europe, and a worsening of the terms of trade. A hypothetical two-percentage-
point rise in international interest rates would increase service payments on external debt by around
US$200 million, equivalent to roughly 0.5 percent of GDP-thus putting additional strain on the budget,
inhibiting private investment through higher domestic interest rates induced by Government borrowing,
4 The (non-agricultural) ICOR values of around 4.5 in the outer projection years, while smaller than those realized in the recent:
past, are not unprecedented. Similar figures prevailed in the late 1 980s.

and worsening the balance of payments. Similarly, higher medium-term growth in Moroccan exports
hinges on stronger growth in Europe than in the last few years; a downturn in Europe is likely to depress
Morocco's growth prospects. However, European growth is now generally projected to be somewhat
stronger over the next three years following a limited recovery in France and Germany, and EU import
growth is expected to average over 6 percent a year over the medium term, well above its 1991-1997
average. Finally, Morocco's exports are still heavily dependent on phosphate rock and derivatives, which
represent more than one-third of total merchandise exports. At current volumes, for example, a 10 percent
drop in phosphate prices would reduce export earnings by some US$140 million over one year. On the
import side, oil and energy products account for more than 15 percent of merchandise imports. Morocco's
terms of trade are therefore sensitive to changes in international prices for phosphates and oil, and a
reversal of the favorable (for Morocco) recent international trends for these prices could worsen balance
of payments prospects and reduce GDP growth.
19.   The authorities' medium-term growth forecast hinges sensitively on a significant increase in
private investment, and a shortfall in the latter would reduce GDP growth prospects. Despite lower
domestic interest rates over the past 18 months, signs of new private investment, and associated demand
for credit, are recent and still modest. Domestic political uncertainty-one possible explanation for the
sluggishness of private investment until recently-has now subsided with the alternance Government's
establishment of a good dialogue with the business community. Nevertheless, at least over the near term,
private entrepreneurs may remain cautious in the face, for example, of the international financial
situation, and of the slow unfolding of trade liberalization with Europe under the Association Agreement.
20.   Finally, medium-term growth prospects hinge critically on the ability of the government to
restructure the composition of the budget in order to allow for a sustainable increase in budgetary savings
and reduction in the fiscal deficit. Failure to implement very decisive actions, especially with regard to the
wage bill and to transfers to public enterprises, could limit the scope of fiscal adjustment, thereby limiting
prospects for "crowding in" private investment and raising growth. However, risks of major slippage in
the fiscal stance, capable of comprornising overall macroeconomic stability, appear very limited, in view
of Morocco's track record over the past decade and the commitment of key policy-makers to maintain
macroeconomic balances.
21.   Financing Requirements and Bank Support. Near-term financing requirements for the budget
and the balance of payments are shown in Tables II.5 and II.6, respectively. Reflecting reduced Treasury
borrowing from the domestic monetary system, the financing plan for the 1998/99 budget (Table 11.5)
provides for net extemal financing flows of negative DH 3.6 billion, compared with negative DH 6.2
billion in 1997/98. In keeping with the Treasury's strategy of reducing the burden of external debt service
over time, the underlying amortization figure (DH 12 billion) could include around DH 2 billion of debt-
equity conversion and pre-payment of high-cost debt. Bank support through the first tranche of the
proposed TPI-SAL and through the first US$200 million of a proposed Policy Reform Support Loan
(PRSL)5 should yield combined disbursements of US$250 million (DH 2.4 billion), plus 1998/99 ADB
co-financing for both operations of US$100 million (DH 970 million). Other quick-disbursing financing
is likely to include funds from the second tranche of the ADB Contractual Savings Adjustment Loan
(US$75 million, or DH 685 million). Project financing is expected to amount to about DH 3.2 billion over
the fiscal year.
5   The PRSL is intended to provide broad-based support for the Government's overall economic and social
reform program. Under this program, the Government intends to pursue sound macroeconomic management,
initiate public sector reform, encourage private sector development and investment, and address the country's
social development agenda. The Government has already taken key actions to bolster the program's credibility
and initiate its implementations. However, implementing the full set of measures which the Government had
set itself as a target prior to Board presentation has proved a much lengthier process than initially envisioned.

22.    The budget financing plan redresses the balance between domestic and foreign financing back
towards the latter, while still allowing for a reduction in external indebtedness (albeit at a slower pace
than over the past few years). Over the last five years, the Treasury has sought to reduce its external
indebtedness by increasing domestic financing for the deficit, inducing a sharp rise in its domestic debt
from 24 to 38.5 percent of GDP between 1991 and 1998. Thus far, this policy has had limited impact on
interest rates, owing to a parallel modernization and liberalization of financial markets, especially for
government debt-which, along with banking sector reforms, has brought about a reduction of the
nominal interest rates on T-bills by almost 2 percentage points over the past two years (though real rates
have remained much more stable in view of the significant decline in inflation). But continued heavy
Treasury domestic borrowing now runs the risk of raising interest rates, to the detriment of private
investment. Pressure on borrowing needs this fiscal year derives in part from an acceleration of the
Treasury's efforts to reduce the stock of domestic arrears.

23.    Balance of payments financing in 1998 is estimated to have included total disbursement of some
US$1.5 billion in new long-term assistance flows. The substantial increase in long-term disbursements
relative to 1997 is attributable (in modest part) to a slight widening of the current account deficit to 0.4
percent of GDP in 1998, compared to 0.3 percent in 1997, and especially to an estimated reduction in
foreign investment flows, which were exceptionally high in 1997, owing in part to the privatization sale
of a large oil refinery. External financing also supported a slight rise in international reserves to some 4.6



9
months of imports. Given overall external financing requirements, heavy reliance on long-term assistance
from multilateral sources reflects the limits on the Moroccan Treasury's scope for raising funds on
international capital markets on favorable terms. The present outlook for 1999, both in terms of overall
balance of payments financing requirements and reliance on long-term loan sources, is broadly similar to
the estimate for 1998.
m. REFORM PROGRAM IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS, POST,
AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTORS
A.  Government's Objectives and Overall Strategy
24.   The Government's reform program in the telecomnmunications, postal, and IT sectors will
contribute to achievement of its overall economic policy objective of strong sustainable growth and
reduced social disparities. The Letter of Sector Development Policy (Annex II) details the objectives that
the Government will pursue in those sectors: (a) increase the competitiveness of Moroccan firms by
ensuring that they benefit from high-quality telecommunications, postal, and IT services at competitive
prices; (b) broaden the access of poor and remote households to modern and efficient means of
information and communication; (c) foster the efficiency of public providers of services such as health
and education through better access to IT; (d) foster the development in Morocco of a vibrant information
and communications industry as a major source of private-sector-led growth; and (e) ensure the financial
autonomy of the postal service.
25.   As detailed in Section C, below, the priority element of the Government's comprehensive reform
program is the effective liberalization of the market for telecommunications services and the
strengthening of the regulatory framework. Other areas include the definition of public service obligations
in the postal and telecommunications sectors, as well as the design of adequate mechanisms to meet these
obligations, and the development of IT activities in order to secure Morocco's place in the information
society.
B.   Progress to Date
26.   Substantial progress has already been made, especially in the telecommunications sector, on the
physical, legal, institutional, and regulatory fronts. Data on the evolution of the Moroccan
telecommunications, postal, and IT sectors in recent years is presented in Annex IV, along with
international benchmarks.
27.   Physical progress. Physical progress has been rapid in the telecommunications sector in recent
years, with substantial expansion and modernization of the network. The total number of main lines
connected increased from 827,000 in 1993 to 1,375,000 at the end of 1997, bringing the overall
penetration rate of fixed telephony to about 5 percent. The number of public phones has increased from
2,225 to 27,000 over the same period. In addition, about 5,600 private telboutiques and telekiosques
were in operation at the end of 1997. While coverage remains very low in rural areas, some progress has
been made there as well: 90 percent of the 1,300 rural communities had at least one phone by the end of
1997. Cellular penetration has also increased in recent years but remains very low (about 27 subscribers
per 10,000 inhabitants in 1997).
28.   The network is 99% digitalized and computerized network maintenance and operation have been
widely introduced. As a result, service quality and efficiency of operation have markedly increased, as



10
shown in Table  1.1 below. However, while the sector's performance is broadly in line with other
countries of the region, further progress is needed if Morocco is to reduce the gap with EU countries or
with other emerging countries that have already implemented pro-competition reforms.

29.    The postal sector has remained relatively stable over the past five years: employment in the sector
has remained between 8,500 and 9,000, and total revenues between 0.20% and 0.26% of GDP (which is
low by international standards, as postal revenues generally account for more than 1% of GDP). The
sector has suffered continuous losses over the period 1993-1997 (ranging from US$27 million in 1995 to
US$4.4 million in 1997). However, in 1998 it showed a profit of US$8 million. While the number of post
offices has slightly increased (from 1,329 in 1993 to 1,470 in 1998), about six percent of the Moroccan
population remain without any postal delivery services and international comparisons show that
Morocco's performance in the sector tends to be lagging.

30.    The IT sector is growing quickly but remains under-developed. Employment in IT manufacturing
is between 7,000 and 7,500. Value-added in IT manufacturing increased from US$115 million (0.35% of
GDP) in 1995 to US$149 million (0.44% of GDP) in 199-. Internet penetration remains very low wilh
only about 1,400 hosts total and 50 internet subscribers per 1 million inhabitants, but it has been growing
exponentially since the introduction of internet services in Morocco in 1995. Data transmission capacity
has also increased. Table E11.3 shows that further progress is needed if Morocco is to close the gap with its
regional and global competitors.

31.    Legal, institutional, and regulatory progress. A number of far-reaching measures have been
adopted with respect to post and telecommunications. First, in February 1997, Morocco presented an
offer, within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), committing the Government to
liberalizing all telecommunications services no later than January 1, 2002. Tunisia is the only other
country in the region to have presented such an offer.
32.    Second, a new law on Post and Telecommunications was promulgated in August 1997 (Law 24-
96), and fifteen decrees and arretes were promulgated in February 1998 or its implementations. This new
legislation constitutes a complete overhaul of previous rules and provides Morocco with a modem legal
framework in the sector. Law 24-96 separates post from telecommunications, replacing the Office
National des Postes et Telecommunications (ONPT) with two new entities: a joint stock company,
Itissalat Al-Maghrib (IAM), providing telecommunications services, and a public body, Barid Al-
Maghrib (BAM), providing postal services. It enables competition in all segments of the
telecommunications market as well as in the market for express international courier services and it also
enables the partial or total privatization of IAM, which is presently state owned. In addition, the law
creates an autonomous regulatory agency for telecommunications, Agence Nationale de Reglementation
du Secteur des TMk.communications (ANRT), the first of its kind in Morocco. ANRT is responsible for
ensuring the proper application of telecommunications legislation and, in particular, for preparing
telecommunications licenses and monitoring the operators' activities.
33.    The three new entities - ANRT, LAM, and BAM - are now operational. ANRT's general manager
was appointed in February 1998, and new staff are being recruited. Inventories of assets transferred from
the ex-ONPT to ANRT, IAM, and BAM have been finalized, and transfer of staff to LAM and BAM has
been completed. BAM and LAM are finalizing the negotiation of a price schedule for the services they
now provide to each other.
34.    As a result of the Government's unambiguous commitment to market liberalization, illustrated by
the WTO agreement of 1997 and the recent legal and regulatory reforms, IAM, the dominant operator,
has started a process of partial rebalancing of tariffs toward actual costs. The price of international
services in particular has been reduced for most destinations: over the period 1988-1998, the price of calls
from Morocco to North America and Europe has been halved. On the other hand, the price of local calls
has progressively increased, from 0.12 MAD to 0.27 MAD per minute. International comparisons reveal,
however, that the price of local calls remains relatively low in Morocco (see Table 11. 1 and Annex IV).
35.   In sum, over the past two years, Morocco has established the foundation of a modern, pro-
competitive telecommunications and postal sector. To reap the benefits of this first phase of reforms, it is
now critically important that competition be introduced in most segments of the telecommunications and
postal markets and that market-based mechanisms be introduced to broaden access of information
services for the poor and the rural areas. Thus, the next phase of reforms, which the proposed loan will
support, will primarily focus on implementation. Those reforms, once implemented, should stimulate



12
investment in advanced information infrastructure and services such as electronic commerce and internet-
based industries. They should also enable a large number of Moroccan citizens to have access to and
participate fully in the information society.
C. Reform Agenda
36.   The Government's reform agenda with respect to telecommunications, post, and IT has six main
components, all of which are expected to be implemented by mid-2000 (Annexes II and III).
37.   Implementing the effective liberalization  of telecommunications. The Government's
liberalization strategy will focus on the award of licenses to enable new telecommunications operators to
compete in providing GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), VSAT (Very Small Aperture
Terminal), and GMPCS (Global Mobile Personal Communications System) services, and on liberalization
of the market for the provision of alternative telecommunications infrastructures.
38.   The Government intends to give to a second GSM operator the means to become an effective
competitor in the telecommunications market. The second GSM operator is to be given the right to: (a)
provide direct international services to its subscribers no later than January 1, 2002; (b) establish its owrn
transmission infrastructure linking its network components; and (c) use GSM technology to provide fixed
wireless services at least in rural areas. International telecommunications operators have shown
considerable interest in the second GSM license (fifteen companies have sent expressions of interest to
ANRT). The expected date for awarding the license is July 1999.
39.   The award of the second GSM license is expected to bring substantial revenues to the Treasury.
More importantly, the entry of a second GSM operator able to compete effectively in the GSM market is
likely to substantially increase service quality and investments in that market, and to accelerate the
downward trend of mobile telephony prices. The Government will closely study the development of the
cellular market over the next few years to determine whether and when to allow further entrants.
40.   With respect to VSAT services, the Government intends to grant licenses enabling operators to
provide value-added services to end users. Private VSAT networks, which require only authorization
from the regulator, are already being established. The Government also envisages granting licenses to all
GMPCS operators interested in providing services in Morocco, provided that allocation of the required
frequencies does not create problems. By granting such licenses early, the Government hopes to convince
operators that Morocco would be an attractive base for terrestrial relay stations. Finally, the Government
will seek to facilitate the development of telecommunications networks by energizing the market for
provision of telecommunications infrastructure. The Government plans, in particular, to allow owners of
alternative telecommunications infrastructure (i.e. infrastructures - such as railways or power lines --
which can be used to provide telecommunications services and which belong to entities other than IAM)
to lease their capacity to telecommunications services operators.
41.    Strengthening the telecommunications regulatory framework. ANRT has been entrusted with
major responsibilities in the telecommunications sector, and the way in which it carries out these
responsibilities will have a profound impact on the development of the sector. Its performance will be
closely watched by potential investors and other interested parties, both within and outside Morocco. The
Government is well aware that the success or failure of the regulatory arrangements put in place for
teleconmnunications is likely to have far-reaching repercussions for the reform agenda in other
infrastructure sectors.
42.   ANRT's ability to successfully perform its functions will be determined largely by three factors:
(a) the degree of autonomy it is able to maintain, especially its capacity to resist political and industry



13
pressures; (b) its technical competence; and (c) the transparency and fairness of its proceedings. A key
determinant of ANRT's autonomy is the way in which it is funded. The revenues ANRT will collect from
operators, in exchange for processing various regulatory requests and for allowing them to use radio
frequencies, are expected to cover its operating costs, thus ensuring its financial autonomy.
43.    The Government has also indicated in its Letter of Sector Development Policy that it will support
the adoption of new staff rules for ANRT. New rules are required to enable the Agency to attract the
highly qualified specialists it needs. The new rules will also include specific provisions - with regard to
conflicts of interest, for example - that are required to maintain the Agency's autonomy and impartiality.
44.    As far as regulatory procedures are concerned, the priority for ANRT is to establish and follow
fair, transparent, and efficient rules. This would involve following a participative approach and ensuring
adequate publication of all main regulatory decisions. In particular, the focus of ANRT will be on
establishing the procedures to solve interconnection disputes. The quality of the interconnection regime as
a whole will greatly affect the price an operator will be willing to pay to obtain the second GSM license;
it will also strongly influence the speed at which effective competition can be introduced in. the
telecommunications market.
45.    Privatizing LAM. Privatization of the main operator is an integral part of the Government's
strategy for the telecommunications sector. It has indicated in its Letter of Sector Development Policy that
its main objective is to contribute to the establishment of an efficient and competitive telecommunications
sector. The privatization should help IAM gain access to the financial, technical, and human resources
that it needs to compete effectively and to take advantage of opportunities that will develop in an open
telecommunications environment. Introducing private participation into LAM's capital will also help to
strengthen the company's autonomy vis-a-vis the Government. This, in turn, will facilitate establishment
of a true level playing field between LAM and its competitors.
46.    The Government is committed, under the TPI-SAL, to take a certain number of steps to prepare
LAM's privatization, including the adoption of an action plan to progressively reduce the arrears owed by
the administration to IAM, the elaboration of a privatization strategy for LAM, and the recruitment of
financial advisors to help the Government implement that strategy. The privatization of the company is
likely to be implemented in 1999/2000.
47.    Increasing access to telecommunications services for the poor and for the inhabitants of remote
areas. Improving access to telecommunications services is key to breaking isolation of people living in
remote areas. It is an important enabling factor for the development of businesses in rural areas, thus
helping to limit the flow of migrants to cities. It is also an essential tool for improving education and
health services in remote parts of the country, which can contribute to reducing disparities between cities
and rural areas. 6
48.    To improve coverage and quality of service while bringing down the cost of public service
obligations, the Government will first seek to better specify the exact scope of the public service
obligations that need to be met, and will then rely on market mechanisms to ensure the provision, at
minimum cost, of quality telecommunications services to those currently deprived of access. The
Government envisages awarding licenses on a competitive basis to operators requiring the lowest
subsidies to meet public service obligations in specific areas. A pilot project is to be launched in the
northern provinces in 1999.
6 Infant mortality, for example, is 43 per 1,000 live births in urban areas and 65 in rural areas. The literacy rate is 63 percent in
urban areas, compared to only 25 percent in rural areas (11 percent for girls and 39 percent for boys).



14
49.   Such a scheme will have several advantages. By relying on competition to ensure that public
service obligations are met, it will likely promote a more efficient use of available subsidies than the
current scheme, which relies exclusively on the public incumbent, LAM. It will also reveal the true cost of
those services and constitute a transparent way of allocating available subsidies to the service providers
meeting non-commercial objectives. Finally, it does not require that a monopoly be maintained to enable
a single provider to charge high prices in profitable markets as a way to cross-subsidize services in
unprofitable ones.
50.   Increasing the competitiveness of postal services. Following the separation of posts and
telecommunications (para. 33), BAM's new management team is committed to improve the efficiency of
the newly established postal entity and to strengthen its financial sustainability. BAM will undertake
studies to determine how to optimize the use of its wide-ranging network. It will, in particular, seek to
develop the potential of the Caisse d'Epargne Nationale by offering new financial services such as
housing finance. BAM will also introduce analytical cost accounting in order to be able to precisely
identify the costs and revenues associated with specific services. This will, inter alia, facilitate the
development of rigorous pricing policies as well as the distinction between results pertaining to the
monopolistic and non-monopolistic segments of the postal sector. In addition, BAM will focus on
developing its strategic, planning, marketing, and auditing functions. These measures are meant to
facilitate ultimately the transformation of BAM into a joint-stock company operating in a competitive
environment.
51.   As in telecommunications, ensuring the provision of adequate postal services in rural areas will
require determining the exact scope of public service obligations, the cost of those obligations, and how
they will be executed and financed. BAM is elaborating an action plan to tackle these issues. BAM has
also announced its intention to explore ways of delegating the provision of postal services in rural areas to
private operators.
52.   Ensuring Morocco's integration into the information society. The Government program
presented by the Prime Minister to Parliament in April 1998 includes a commitment to Morocco's
integration in the information society. This commitment reflects the Government's vision that in modem
economies, IT industries have emerged as a major engine of growth and job creation and as an agent of
social change. In the United States, for instance, the IT share of GDP increased to 8.2 percent in 1998
from 4.5 percent in 1985, and between 1995 and 1996, IT industries supplied 10.5 percent of the total 2.2
million new jobs. India has emerged as one of the leading software exporters among developing
countries. Software exports have been growing by more than 55 percent annually over the last five years,
jumping from US$1.1 billion to US$1.75 billion in the year to March 31, 1998. Accelerating IT
development, therefore, is a major component of the Government's overall economic program. In
addition, Morocco's integration into the information society will strengthen current political reforms
toward a more open and transparent society.
53.   The Government will develop a national IT strategy with an action plan aimed at: (a) establishing
high-capacity links among administrative and business centers, hospitals, and universities; (b) developing
an adequate regulatory framework for the use of IT; (c) promoting electronic commerce; (d) modernizing
public administration (under the "Government on Line" initiative, efforts are being undertaken to
computerize administrative departments and develop more efficient, IT-based procedures); (e) promoting
investment and entrepreneurship in IT activities; and (f) promoting the use of IT technologies within
firms. The Government will also pursue efforts to ensure Y2K compliance. Under the InfoDev program,,
two grants for a total of US$600,000 were recently approved to help the Govermnent prepare and
implement a Y2K remediation program.



15
D.   Bank Strategy
54.    The Bank has been involved in Morocco's telecommunications sector since the early 1980s. The
Bank's strategy in the sector has developed in three distinct phases. First, a sector review conducted in
1981-1982 was followed by two investment projects.' With these two operations, the Bank contributed
substantially to modernizing the network, increasing network capacity, and extending the network in rural
areas. The 1993 Telecommunications Sector Restructuring project paved the way for future sector and
institutional reforms by strengthening ONPT's institutional capacity as well as the Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications' ability to carry out regulatory functions and to prepare sector reforms. 8
55.    During the second phase, from 1993 to 1998, the Bank focused on assisting the Government in
the design of substantial institutional and sector reforms in telecomtnunications. Various instruments were
used to that effect, including: (a) implementation of the Telecommunications Sector Restructuring
Project; (b) realization and dissemination of several pieces of economic and sector work;9 (c) award of an
IDF grant for the preparation of telecommunications privatization; and (d) preparation of the present
adjustment operation. Partly as a result of the intensive policy dialogue with the Bank facilitated by these
instruments, the Government implemented various far-reaching legal and institutional reforms, in
particular the adoption of Law 24-96. It also began to design sector policies for telecommunications, post,
and IT, with an emphasis on competition and private participation.
56.    The third phase, building on this legal and institutional foundation, will focus on market
liberalization, in particular the effective introduction of competition in most segments of the
telecommunications sector under an agreed time frame. It will begin with the implementation of the
reforms supported by the proposed loan (Section IV.A). In addition, future operations could support
implementing the national IT strategy or deepening the initial reforms in the postal sector (Section IV.F).
57.    Coordination with development partners. Throughout this third phase, the Bank intends to
pursue its policy of close cooperation with its development partners. The ADB and the EU have prepared
the TPI-SAL jointly with the Bank, and the three institutions will cooperate closely on supervision and
implementation activities. The IDF and PHRD grants are used by the Bank and the Moroccan authorities
to strengthen institutional capacity in the telecommunications sector and to facilitate the elaboration and
implementation of the telecommunications reform program.
58.    IFC has been involved in the preparation of the proposed loan, notably to incorporate private
investors' concerns (such as competition, access and tariffs), while trying to meet public policy objectives
of maximizing the benefits of liberalization of the sector. In particular, IFC accessed Trust Funds to
contract a consultant to review the draft bidding documents of the second GSM. Thus, encouraged by the
new legal and regulatory framework supported by the proposed loan, several potential bidders for the
second GSM have already contacted IFC to discuss its possible participation in the financing of their
investment. The Govemment has indicated that it would welcome IFC's catalytic role in this first major
private transaction in the telecommunications sector. IFC could also consider becoming involved in the
privatization of LAM. Finally, one of the objectives of the Government's reform program is to accelerate
the development of IT-related industries, and IFC could consider contributing to the funding of their
investments.
7 Telecommunications Project (Loan 2798-MOR); and Teleconmmunications Sector Restructuring Project (Loan 3557-MOR).
Both operations were implemented successfully. The first was rated satisfactory by OED and the second highly satisfactory.
See OED Evaluative Memorandum L2798-MOR (1995) and OED Evaluation Summary L3557-MOR (1998).

IV. THIE PROPOSED LOAN
A.  Project Description
59.   The proposed EUR 85.21 million (US$101 million equivalent) loan to the Kingdom of Morocco
is to be disbursed in two tranches of EUR 42.44 million (first tranche; 49.81% of the loan amount) and
EUR 42.77 million (second tranche; 50.19% of the loan amount). The first tranche recognizes the
importance of measures the Government has already adopted in the course of continued policy dialogue
with the Bank, and the second supports the design and implementation of further substantial reforms
(Annex E). The operation puts particular emphasis on introducing substantial competition in the
telecommunications sector and strengthening the regulatory framework of the sector. The operation is
also designed to help the Government achieve its specific objectives of bringing communication services
to poor and remote households and of enabling Morocco's insertion within the information society.
60.   First tranche. Prior to Board presentation, the Government has taken the actions necessary to
enable disbursement of the first tranche of the loan. The Government has: (i) agreed to maintain a sound
macroeconomic framework, to be assessed in close cooperation with the IMF; (ii) agreed to implement a
medium-term reform program in the telecomrnunications, post, and IT sectors (Annex II); (iii) agreed to a
set of monitoring indicators with respect to the macroeconomic framework and the implementation of the
telecommunications, post, and IT reform program, as outlined in Annex V; and (iv) undertaken the
following activities:
(a)  realization by ANRT of a study on the potential of alternative telecommunications
infrastructures in Morocco;
(b)   selection, through a competitive and transparent process, of an international financial advisor
to assist ANRT in preparing and implementing the award process for the second GSM
license;
(c)   elaboration by ANRT of procedures pertaining to the declarations required for the provision
of value-added services;
(d)  identification by ANRT of the technical assistance the Agency will require over the next two
years;
(e)   clarification by LAM of the amount of arrears owed to it by the administration;
(f)   declaration to Parliament by the Prime Minister on the integration of Morocco into the
information society; and
(g)  implementation of the action plan of the State Secretariat for Post and Information
Technology to manage computer-related issues posed by passage to the Year 2000.
61.   Second tranche. The disbursement of the second tranche will be predicated upon: (a) continued
satisfactory overall macroeconomic performance; (b) satisfactory progress in implementation of the
Government's reform program in the telecommunications, post, and IT sectors; and (c) adoption of the
following actions laid out in the loan agreement:
(a)   Adoption of decrees granting VSAT licenses to at least two operators, each through a
competitive and transparent selection process, enabling them to provide value-added services.
(b)   Realization, by ANRT, of a study on the legal aspects of the provision of alternative:
telecommunications infrastructure, as specified under Law 24-96, including the drafting of
procedures and legal instruments enabling owners of such infrastructure to make themL
available to telecommunications service providers and operators of independent networks.
(c)   Adoption of a decree granting the second GSM license through a competitive and transparent
process, with a schedule of terms and conditions allowing the operator to: (i) establish its own
transmission infrastructure linking its network components; (ii) provide direct international



17
services to its subscribers no later than January 1, 2002; and (iii) provide fixed cellular
services, at least in rural areas.
(d)    Adoption and publication by ANRT, as provided by the law, of procedures pertaining to the
resolution of interconnection disputes, ensuring the consultation of interested parties as well
as the publication of regulatory decisions and of the reasons for those decisions.
(e)    Adoption by the Government, of a privatization strategy for IAM.
B.    Technical Assistance
62.    A technical assistance program  funded by EU  and PHRD  grants (about US$6.3 million and
US$200,000, respectively) aims at facilitating the implementation of the above sector reforms and at
ensuring their sustainability. It includes:
*  Assistance to ANRT for the design of an adequate interconnection regime and for the preparation of
the second GSM operator's cahier des charges.
*   Completion of a study on the likely impact on the Moroccan telecommunications sector in general,
and on LAM in particular, of introducing a second GSM operator.'0
*   Completion of a first study on the potential of alternative telecommunications infrastructure in
Morocco" and launch of a second study, to be completed by May 1999, to help devise the legal
procedures and instruments required to implement the liberalization of the market for the provision of
such infrastructure.
*   Assistance to the Ministry of Privatization for the design of a privatization strategy for LJM and for
the implementation of the audits and other measures required to prepare IAM for privatization.
*   EU-financed assistance to help ANRT in all its main areas of responsibility over a four-year period
(1999-2002).
C.   Fiscal Impact of the Reforms
63.    The cumulative net fiscal impact of the reforns over a period of four years is expected to be
positive: the fiscal benefits range from about US$255 million to US$1.33 billion by the end of 2002,
depending on the estimates of the proceeds to be received for the second GSM license and for the
privatization of IAM (see Annex VI). A net fiscal cost can be expected in the very short run, reaching
about US$31.5 million by mid-1999. This cost is due to the progressive phasing out of the monopoly tax
levied on LAM (this tax, 10 percent of IAM's gross revenues, will decline by 2 percent every year
beginning in 1998 until its complete elimination in 2002) and to the payment of arrears by the
The study found that in the broad range of countries considered - from Ghana and Cote d'lvoire to Northem European
countries, the United Kingdom, and the United States - the number of GSM subscribers increased at a faster rate, for both the
incumbent and the second operator, after the entry of the second operator. There was also increased investment in the GSM
network by the incumbent operator, demonstrating the continued profitability of that operator even after the entry of its
competitor. See Rohlfs, Jeffrey H., Effects of the Entrance of a Second GSM Operator on the Cellular Telecommunications
Market and on the Incumbent Operator, Strategic Policy Research, October 1998.
" The study confirmed that alternative telecommunications infrastructures do exist at present in Morocco and that the capacity
of existing networks is about to be substantially increased, with some entities, such as the Office National de l'Electricite
(ONE) an(i the Office National des Chemins de Fer (ONCF), planning to expand their facilities in the near future. It also
found that there is important potential demand for such infrastructures: indeed, candidates for the second GSM license have
already initiated discussions with some owners of altemative infrastructures on possible leasing arrangements. See Conditions
techniques et 1lgales pour la fourniture des infrastructures alternatives de telecommunications au Maroc, Devotech Conseil,
October 1998.



18
administration to IAM.'2 By the second half of 1999, however, those costs should be more than
compensated, first by the price paid for the second GSM license, and later on by privatization proceeds
and additional tax revenues due to overall market enlargement and higher sector profitability.
64.    Two additional potential sources of costs can be identified. First, there will be costs involved in
establishing the new regulatory framework and carrying out new regulatory functions; these costs will
however be much smaller than those mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The other costs relate to the
impact of the reform of the international accounting and settlement rates system."3 This would lower the
receipts from incoming international calls for numerous operators, and therefore reduce
telecommnunications revenues in countries such as Morocco where the volume of incoming international
traffic far outweighs that of outgoing traffic. The financial impact of such measures is likely to be
significant.'4 It is however, very difficult to estimate in the absence of reliable data on the elasticity of
demand for international telecommunications in Morocco and on future tariff adjustments in the countries
of destination.
D.   Rationale for Bank Involvement
65.    The contours of the overall private sector agenda have recently been defined in the context of the
preparation of a proposed multi-sector adjustment operation - the Morocco Policy Reform Support Loan
(PRSL). The PRSL has been designed as a broad instrument to be complemented by more narrowly
focused operations in the various sectors where the reform agenda, including the promotion of private
sector development, can be deepened and pushed forward. The TPI-SAL further pursues that agenda in
the telecommunications, post, and IT sectors. Given their complementary nature, the rationale for Bank
lending is similar for the two operations.
66.    The proposed loan would support a fiscal stance conducive to an expansion of private investment
while helping to buttress external reserves in order to guard against Morocco's continuing vulnerability to
balance of payments shocks. As explained in Section II.C, additional external financing for the budget
provided under the TPI-SAL, coupled with a declining overall budget deficit, would reduce the risk of
putting upward pressure on domestic interest rates and crowding out private investment, on which the
potential for higher growth in the medium term depends.
67.    The additional medium-term financing contributed by the TPI-SAL would help offset Morocco's
vulnerability to exogenous shocks created by droughts, fluctuations in prices of phosphates (which still
constitute over one-third of Morocco's merchandise exports), and downturns in foreign exchange receipts
from tourism and FDI, which have historically shown considerable vulnerability to regional events
outside Morocco's control. In this context, the modest build-up in reserves to a level of about 4.6 months
12 The Govemment is committed to progressively reduce the arrears of the administration to three months of consumption
(Annex III). The assumption made in Annex VI is that this goal is progressively achieved over a period of 2.5 years, from
mnid 1999 until the end of 2001.
3 The system was designed, at a time when intemational services were provided by traditional monopoly provider, to determine
how much an operator should be compensated for terminating a call originating in another country. Under the system, such
payments are much higher than the costs of terminating the calls and the accounting rates regime is now coming under
increasing pressures through the combined effects of technology and pro-competition policy reforms. With the growing
liberalization of telecommunications markets, intemational tariffs will increasingly be based on costs and the intemational
accounting and settlement rates system is likely to disintegrate over time. See Braga, Carlos A. Primo, Emmanuel Forestier
and Peter Stern, Developing Countries and Accounting Rates Reform-A Technological and Regulatory El Niflo?, Viewpoint
Note No. 173, January 1999.

Communications Commission).

of imports of goods and services at end-1998 envisioned under the Government's program constitutes a
prudent policy measure which the two Bank loans will help achieve. Finally, given current international
financial market conditions, external financing alternatives to the proposed loan would be on substantially
less favorable terms, reducing the potential for fiscal consolidation and expansion of private investment.
E.   The Present Operation and the Country Assistance Strategy
68.   The present operation will contribute to achieving the objectives of the 1997 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) of increased private participation and competition in most infrastructure services, in
particular telecommunications, to modernize the network, and to put downward pressure on tariffs, thus
contributing to private sector competitiveness and improving the affordability of the services. The
performance indicators for telecommunications laid out in the CAS - adoption of the new
Telecommunications Law before end-1996; licensing of operators for selected services in 1997; and
privatization of the main operator in 1997/1998 - have been or are expected to be achieved with a delay
of about one year.
69.   Satisfactory implementation of the telecommunications reforms identified under the TPI-SAL
will go a long way toward establishing a more competitive and efficient telecommunications sector. In
early 1999, the authorities requested further Bank assistance to build on the reforms supported by the TPI-
SAL in the IT and postal sectors. A mission was carried out in March 1999 to identify the components of
a possible investment operation in these sectors. The operation will focus on modernizing basic postal
operations, enhancing the use of information technologies in the public sector, and developing electronic
commerce.
G.  Disbursement and Auditing
70.   Disbursement arrangements will follow the simplified procedures approved by the Board on
February 1, 1996. The Borrower will open an account in the Central Bank of Morocco. Upon
effectiveness, proceeds will be deposited by the Bank in this account at the request of the Borrower the
proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes (i.e., to finance items imported from non-member
countries, or goods or services in the standard negative list), the Bank will require the Borrower to either
(i) return that amount to the account to use for eligible purposes, or (ii) refund the amount directly to the
Bank, in which case the Bank will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the loan. Although a
routine audit of the deposit account is not automatically required, the World Bank reserves the right to
require it. The closing date for the TPI-SAL will be December 31, 2000.
H.  Cofinancing
71.   The African Development Bank (ADB) is cofmancing the TPI-SAL for an amount of 80 million
Units of Accounts. As indicated in paragraph 1, disbursement of the ADB loan will take place in two
tranches also, and is predicated upon the adoption of the same measures as the TPI-SAL.
I.   Environmental Aspects
72.   The TPI-SAL is in environmental category C, which does not require an environmental
assessment. The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact. It will not finance any civil
works, and the main policy reforms it promotes - liberalization of the teleconmmunications sector and
strengthening of the regulatory agency - will lead to more efficient and cheaper telecommunications
services, which are expected to substitute, to a certain extent, for personal transportation and therefore



20
reduce environmental pollution and promote energy conservation. In addition, all telecommunications
operators are subject to strict environmental regulations issued by the Ministere de lAmenagement du
Territoire. ANRT, the new telecommunications regulator, has the mandate to ensure that all
telecomnmunications operators abide by those regulations.
J.   Program Objectives and Poverty Category
73.   As the loan supports a package of measures designed mainly to create an environment conducive
to new entry and enhanced competition in the telecommunications, post, and IT sectors, it falls within the
category of private sector development. The loan also contributes to poverty reduction through a
program of targeted interventions aimed at facilitating the access of poor and remote households to
telecommunications, postal, and IT services.
K.  Monitorable Indicators
74.   To monitor the impact of the reform program and agree, if needed, on corrective measures, a set
of eight indicators have been identified and will be jointly monitored by the Government and the Bank.
These indicators are designed to help monitor the evolution over the next three years of the structure of
the telecommunications sector and the efficiency of new investments in the sector, as well as the quality,
price, and coverage of telecommunications services. In addition, macroeconomic indicators have been
identified jointly by the Government and the Bank that will be monitored in close cooperation with the
IMU. Both sets of monitorable indicators are presented in Annex V.
L.   Benefits and Risks
75.   Benefits. Competitiveness of the private sector. The TPI-SAL supports the adoption of pro-
competitive measures in the telecommunications sector, which will put downward pressure on the price of
basic and advanced services, foster innovation and diversification, and increase quality. Corporate users,
in particular, stand to gain from a larger range of innovative and higher quality services at competitive
prices. LAM stands to benefit from the reforms as well: competition-induced growth of the overall
telecommunications market will bring IAM substantial proceeds from interconnection, while increased
competitive pressures will push the company to seek new customers by expanding its network and
developing a broader range of services. The TPI-SAL also supports the adoption of a national information
infrastructure strategy aimed, inter alia, at promoting the development of IT services to the benefit of
enterprises. Easier access to IT will help companies increase the efficiency of their internal organization,
communicate more effectively with suppliers and clients, and enhance their integration with the rest of the
Moroccan and international economy.
76.   Access. Poor residents of rural and outlying urban areas will gain greater access to
telecommunications services as more intense competition and reliance on market mechanisms in the
sector spur network development and improve quality of service in remote areas. Higher penetration of
telecommunications, as well as postal and IT services, will strengthen the informational and economic
links between these areas and the rest of the country, thus facilitating the development of local businesses
and improving the management capacity of local governments. Improved access to communications will
also enable the more effective provision of social services such as health and education, which are critical
for reducing social disparities and stemming the flow of mnigrants to cities.
77.   Additional fiscal revenues and new sources of economic growth. The Treasury will gain
substantial fiscal revenues from implementation of the reforms, stemming mainly from higher taxes
(caused by a competition-induced enlargement of the telecommunications market) and from the flow of



21
domestic and foreign direct investment associated with the award of the second GSM license and the
privatization of LAM (Annex VI). In addition, the existence of new cellular, VSAT, and VAS operators,
as well as new developments in the IT sector, should help stimulate the emergence in Morocco of vibrant
IT-based industries, support development of the service industry, which accounts for an increasingly
important share of GDP in rapidly developing economies, and generate well-paying jobs.
78.   Risks. The main risk associated with the implementation of the Government program is the
possible reversal of some key policy measures, notably: (a) the introduction of effective competition in
the telecommunications sector, which is particularly opposed by some within IAM who fear the loss of
LAM's monopoly position; and (b) the strengthening of the regulator's autonomy, which is opposed, inter
alia, by some members of the Executive and Legislative branches who are reluctant to limit the role of the
central administration. Other, less serious but still significant risks for the operation stem from the
complexity of some of the measures to be implemented. Implementing an adequate interconnection
regime, for example, is crucial to ensure effective competition, but it is also a technically difficult as well
as politically and commercially sensitive task. Successfully meeting this challenge depends to a large
extent on ANRT's ability to mobilize adequate in-house as well as outside expertise.
79.   Risk mitigation. The adoption of Law 24-96, the establishment of ANRT, and the attached Letter
of Sector Development Policy (Annex II) demonstrate the Government's commitment to the reform
program. Also, the general consensus in favor of the program, which particularly benefits the private
sector, makes a reversal of Government policies unlikely. Continued capacity building of ANRT will be
necessary to ensure the sustainability of reforms in this early phase of the liberalization process. It will be
facilitated by a comprehensive TA package funded by the EU. Such assistance will cover, inter alia:
staffing and financial planning issues, design of regulatory procedures, and interconnection issues, as well
as the legal dimensions of the liberalization of the provision of alternative telecommunications
infrastructures. The TPI-SAL also supports measures to ensure ANRT's financial autonomy and its
ability to recruit highly qualified staff. Technical assistance is also extended to the Ministry of
Privatization to support the design of IAM's privatization strategy.
V. RECOMMENDATION
80.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank,
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

ANNEX II
LETTER OF SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY
(UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION OF FRENCH VERSION)
February 24, 1999
KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
REFORM PROGRAM IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS,
POST, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTORS
Sir,
The Government of Morocco is pleased to share with you its vision and strategy for the
telecommunications, post, and information technology sectors.
Recognizing that the post and telecommunications sectors have been a major force driving
Morocco's economic and social development, and that they encourage the flowering and
dissemination of the country's cultural heritage, the Government has made these sectors a priority
in its development plans over the past ten years.
Now that a new regulatory framework has been adopted, the Government plans to develop
telecommunications and postal infrastructure throughout the country for the benefit of all
segments of the population, thereby providing Moroccan enterprises with the efficient
communications resources they need in order to help build industrial capacity and increase
national productivity.
Given the new challenges created by the liberalization process set in motion by the
adoption of Law 24-96, the Government plans to devise a clear strategy and a consistent action
plan to energize the telecommunications, posts, and information technology sectors.
The Government believes that these sectors play a key role in the country's economic and
social development, and that they should continue to be a major focus of attention in order to
secure Morocco's place in the information society through the use of efficient communications
and information access services.
This letter identifies the Government's major objectives and the steps that have already
been taken in this field, and describes the strategy it will follow to achieve these objectives. The
strategy set out below covers, inter alia, all the measures that the Government intends to adopt
within the framework of the reform program for the telecommunications, post, and information
technology sectors. These measures are also presented in the form of a matrix in Annex II.



Annex II
Page 2 of 7
I.   Government Obiectives
The Government believes that the telecommunications, post, and information technology
sectors are key elements of the Moroccan economy and that sound sector policies must be
adopted in order to achieve two major objectives, namely, to accelerate economic growth and
reduce social disparities. The Government wishes to secure Morocco's place in the information
society, increase the competitiveness of the postal service, and promote the development of a
competitive and dynamic telecommunications sector to enable the country to meet the challenges
of the twenty-first century. To this end, the Government plans to do the following:
*  Provide Moroccan enterprises with access to the telecommunications, postal, and information
technology services they require in order to become more competitive. The Government
believes that the demand by enterprises for such services should be met as quickly as
possible, and that the services must be of high quality and competitively priced. Finally, a
sufficiently broad range of services should be available.
* Provide poor and remote households with access to modern means of communication and
information. To accomplish this, it is necessary to define the scope of public service
obligations in the telecommunications and postal sector and to ensure that these obligations
are met in such a way as to guarantee sufficient coverage at a reasonable cost for the country
as a whole.
* Foster the modernization and efficiency of the administration and of public institutions
providing social services such as health and education, through better access to and more
efficient use of information technology.
*  Ensure the financial autonomy of the postal service.
*  Generate revenues for the Treasury in the fields of telecommunications and information
technology. Such revenues would come primarily from taxes levied on the activities of
operators.
e  Promote the emergence of new economic activities in Morocco based on the development
and use of information technologies.
II.  Measures Already Adopted
A number of measures have already been adopted in order to achieve the aforementioned
objectives. For example - pursuant to the 1988-92 orientation plan, which made the
telecommunications sector a priority, and the 1993-97 performance contract between the
Government and the National Post and Telecommunications Office (Office National des Postes et
Telecommunications, ONPT) - considerable progress has been made in expanding and
modernizing the telecommunications network, developing services in rural areas, and providing a
broad range of new services, including data transmission and cellular phone services.
For example, switching capacity rose from 293,000 lines at the end of 1987 to 1,683,000
lines in 1997, while the number of lines in service rose from 266,000 to 1,375,000 during the
same period. In addition, network transmission capacity increased from nearly 4,000 circuits to
466,000, mainly through the use of fiber-optic technology (more than 4,000 km of high-capacity



Annex II
Page 3 of 7
fiber-optic cable were installed in recent years). During the same period, average connection time
fell from 80 months to 1.4 months, including in rural areas.
The use of more advanced fiber-optic technology (synchronous digital hierarchy, SDH)
and the digitalization of virtually all of Morocco's transmission and switching systems vastly
improved the network's reliability and made it possible to expand the range of services offered,
including videotex, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), the Internet, and high-capacity
connections.
Rural telecommunications services also were improved, the number of rural communes
with automated networks having risen from 65 to 1,058, or 82 percent of the 1,297 rural
communes in the country. The number of secondary rural communities with automated systems
rose from 69 to 1,498, or 5 percent of 31,888 such communities.
In addition, expansion of the public telephone network increased the number of public
phones from 484 in 1987 to 27,000 at the end of 1997; 83 percent of these were managed by
private operators (5,600 at the end of 1997).
Initiatives are also underway to improve the management of postal services. A program to
computerize postal offices has been launched. By the end of 1998, 240 offices, accounting for
more than 85 percent of the revenues of Barid Al-Maghrib (BAM), will have been computerized.
Pilot email access sites have been set up on university campuses, and the experiment will
be extended in the near future.
New information technology resources have been introduced for funds transfers, including
electronic money orders and use of the EUROGIRO network for overseas transfers.
Management of postal checking accounts and of the Caisse d 'Epargne Nationale has been
computerized, thus offering users continually improving services.
The most far-reaching reform measures, however, have been adopted in the post and
telecommunications sectors with respect to the legal and institutional framework. These measures
include in particular:
*  The presentation by Morocco of an offer on telecommunications within the framework of the
World Trade Organization (WTO, February 1997);
*  The promulgation of Law 24-96 in August 1997. This law enables the introduction of
competition in all segments of the telecommunications market and privatization of the main
operator. The law separated post from telecommunications by establishing a public entity for
post (3AM) and a joint stock company - currently state owned - for telecommunications,
Itissalat Al-Maghrib (LAM). The law also created the national telecommunications regulatory
agency (Agence Nationale de Reglementation du Secteur des Telecommunications, ANRT),
an autonomous institution;
*  The promulgation of 15 decrees and arretes implementing Law 24-96 and covering, inter
alia, the principles governing interconnection agreements for telecommunications networks,
provisions goveming LAM's cahier des charges, and the list of value-added
telecommunications services that can be provided simply upon declaration to the regulator

(the liberalization of these services is now complete, and the regulator receives an average of
five declarations daily from operators wishing to provide such services);
Licensing of four express international courier service operators.
III.  The Planned Strate2
The program the Government plans to implement focuses simultaneously on
telecommunications, post, and information technology.
E-1 Telecommunications
The Government is convinced that achievement of its objectives in the telecommunications
sector hinges on introducing effective competition. Technological developments in this field now
make it essential to involve many operators in order to ensure more rapid implementation of
technological innovations, higher-quality service, more competitive prices, and accelerated
network expansion. The Government's first priority in the telecommunications sector is,
therefore, to implement the pro-liberalization reforms made possible by the adoption of Law 24-
96 and its implementing legislation.
The Government intends to grant a series of licenses to increase the number of operators
providing various types of service. The Government first intends to focus on the Global System
for Mobile Communications (GSM), Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) communications,
the Global Mobile Personal Communications System (GMPCS), and alternative infrastructures.
With respect to GSM, the Government plans, by June 1999, to grant a license enabling an
operator in addition to LAM to provide GSM services. The license will be awarded following a
competitive bidding process, as envisaged in Law 24-96. The relevant cahier des charges will
enable the operator to: (i) establish its own transmission infrastructure linking its network
components; (ii) provide direct international access to its subscribers by January 1, 2002 at the
latest; and (iii) provide fixed cellular services, at least in rural areas.
With respect to VSAT, the objective is to grant licenses enabling operators to provide value-
added services. As to GMPCS, such services are expected to have a major impact on the sector,
and the Government intends to introduce licenses tailored to this type of system in 1999.
With respect to alternative telecommunications infrastructures, the Government plans to
allow owners of such infrastructures to make them available to providers of telecommunications
services and operators of independent networks. A study will be completed by June 1999 with the
objective of identifying and developing the required procedures and instruuments.
In the near future - although the process may extend beyond the period covered by the reform
program identified in the Bank's Telecommunications, Post and Information Technology Sector
Adjustment Loan - the Government intends to strengthen competition and increase the number of
telecommunications operators, particularly by expanding the list of services which can be
provided simply upon declaration to the authorities. The Government will also consider the
desirability of granting additional GSM licenses in the future. Liberalization of fixed telephone
services also will be pursued, in keeping with Morocco's commitments within the framework of
the WTO. With this end in view, the Government has undertaken a study of the instruments it



Annex II
Page 5 of 7
will use and the schedule for the liberalization of services. The results of the study will be known
by late March 1999.
Strengthening the regulatory framework is the Government's second priority in the
telecommunications sector. Above all, it is essential to ensure that ANRT is in a position to assist
in implementing the liberalization strategy outlined above.
The Government intends to provide ANRT with the resources and autonomy it requires in
terms of both financing and personnel. In regard to financing, the Government wishes to ensure
that ANRT has sufficient revenues to meet its needs. In the coming months ANRT will prepare
financial projections enabling it to present clear estimates of its future costs and revenues over a
two or three-year period and to ensure its financial viability over the same period. Moreover, to
guarantee its autonomy ANRT will ultimately have to rely on its own resources for most of its
needs and should not have to count on transfers from the State budget. Accordingly, the
Government will incorporate in the 1999-2000 Finance Law provisions allocating a specific
percentage of licensing revenues that reflects the Agency's real needs, as envisaged in Article 38
of Law 24-96.
With respect to the Agency's personnel, the Government plans to adopt new staff rules
reflecting the unique nature of ANRT and the skills required by an entity responsible for
regulating the telecommunications sector. The staff rules will also include professional ethics
provisions reflecting the special responsibilities of ANRT. In the coming months, ANRT will
focus on formulating and implementing a policy on appropriate training for its regulatory
personnel. The Government ultimately plans to separate ANRT from the National Post and
Telecommunications Institute (Institut National des Postes et Tle&ommunications, INPT). The
latter institution, which is currently part of ANRT, has no regulatory responsibilities and is a
drain on ANRT's budget.
One of ANRT's major tasks is to ensure that service providers follow sound, lawful practices.
In particular, interconnection tariffs should reflect the service providers' actual costs as well as
the costs of other operators providing interconnection services. ANRT is also authorized by law
to audit operators' accounts for verification purposes.
It is also essential for ANRT to follow fair and transparent rules in its dealings with operators
and customers. The Agency will gradually elaborate a set of procedures ensuring, inter alia, that
interested parties are consulted, regulatory decisions and the explanations for them are published,
and decisions can be appealed. Priority will be given to defining procedures that will be useful in
the immediate future, such as those to be followed when resolving interconnection disputes.
The Govermnent' s third priority in the telecommunications sector concerns the privatization
of LAM. It considers this privatization necessary so that the main operator can secure the capital,
know-how, and autonomy it needs to perform optimally in an increasingly more open and
competitive environment. Privatization of LAM will also facilitate efforts to develop competition
among all operators. By March 1999, the Government intends to define and then start to
implement a privatization strategy for LAM that is compatible with these objectives and tailored
to Morocco's circumstances. A number of experts have already been recruited to assist the
Government in achieving these goals.
The Government's fourth and final priority in this sector is to ensure that telecommunications
services are provided on an ongoing, regular basis throughout Morocco and that all people are
given equal access and treatment at affordable prices. The measures adopted will also make it



Annex II
Page 6 of 7
possible to reduce regional disparities and promote the development of areas on the outskirts of
cities, the provision of services to and the opening up of rural areas, and the extension of the
public telephone network. The Government attaches considerable importance to this effort, which
presents a number of challenges. A clear definition of the objectives being pursued in this regard
will make it possible to determine exactly the scope of the public service obligations that need to
be met. The next task will be to determine the real costs of meeting those obligations and ensure
that the resources available to cover those costs are used as efficiently as possible. Finally, it is
important to identify ways to finance these obligations that do not place a disproportionate burden
on any one operator and that are not based on cross-subsidies by a particular provider.
The Government plans to take advantage of the relevant opportunities specifically created by
Law 24-96, particularly the requirement that all operators of public telecommunications networks
contribute to the cost of public service obligations, and the reliance on market mechanisms to
meet those obligations. The Government plans initially to implement a pilot program in the
northern provinces for this purpose.
m-2 Post
The Government intends to continue the postal sector reforms already underway, as
exemplified by the establishment of BAM, and will endeavor to strengthen the competitiveness of
postal services in general.
The Government attaches considerable importance in this sector both to meeting certain
public service obligations and to ensuring that the sector remains financially sound. As in the case
of telecommunications, it is important to clarify public service obligations, their cost, the manner
in which they will be determined and financed, and the way the operators that are to meet the
obligations will be identified. Here, too, the Government plans to implement a pilot program to
extend private postal services to remote areas.
BAM, for its part, will endeavor to improve its performance by implementing an action plan
comprising measures to:
*  Reorganize financing and accounting procedures in the postal service by introducing
analytical cost accounting and adequate management control procedures;
*  Optimize existing postal infrastructures by diversifying services offered and extending public
services to private entities;
* Develop the Caisse d'Epargne Nationale and postal checking accounts by improving client
services without causing financial sector distortions;
*  Strengthen the commercial activities of the postal service;
* Develop internal and external communications capabilities;
*  Begin a study on extending the provision of private postal services to remote areas through
franchising.
The ultimate objective is to transform BAM into a joint stock company operating in a
competitive environment.



Annex II
Page 7 of 7
III-3 Information Technologies
The Government is convinced that Morocco must secure a place in the information society
if the country is to achieve the objectives outlined above, which include enabling all segments of
society to enjoy access to information, enhancing the competitiveness of enterprises, and
developing new economic activities in the crucial information technology sector.
The Government also intends to promote online access by the public to a variety of
services, including education and health. It will actively encourage telecommuting and promote
its use to leverage service exports, given Morocco's proximity to Europe and the country's pool
of skilled, competitively remunerated manpower.
The Government will rapidly implement the national information technology strategy now
in preparation. The strategy will focus primarily on:
* Establishing high-capacity networks to support services with high added value and link, inter
alia, administrative centers, hospitals, universities, and business centers.
*  Establishing a legal framework for the use of information technologies;
* Promoting electronic commerce;
* Modernizing the administration (the Government on Line initiative);
* Developing information technology activities;
* Promoting the use of information technologies within firms.
In conclusion, the Government believes that the reform program described in this Letter and
in Annex EII reflects the key priorities of its policy in the telecommunications, post, and
information technology sectors.
Yours sincerely,
S.E. Larbi Ajjoul
Secretary of State in Charge of Posts and Information Technology

ANNEX IV
KEY SECTOR DATA
This Annex considers some fundamental indicators of the evolution of the telecommunications, post and
information technology sectors in Morocco over the 1993-1997 period. It also provides international
benchmarks to put Morocco's performance in perspective: Morocco is benchmarked against regional
competitors (Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey), global emerging economies (Chile, Malaysia), and two
European economies (Ireland and Portugal) which have recently implemented substantial reforms in the
telecommunications, post and information technology sectors.
Telecommunications
The share of telecommunications revenues in GDP has remained stable between 1993 and 1997 in
Morocco at about 1.8-2.0%, a value which is close to the average of those observed in industrialized
countries. This would tend to indicate that there is room for expansion, as the share of
telecommunications revenues in GDP is higher in the most dynamic emerging economies where
telecommunications and information technologies play a key role in supporting the growth of the export
and service sectors (the share of telecommunications revenues in GDP reaches about 2.5% in Chile and
Malaysia for example).
The fixed network has been considerably extended, over the period, at an annual rate of 13.6% on
average: the number of installed fixed lines has increased from 827.000 in 1993 to about 1.375.000 at the
end of 1997, bringing the overall penetration rate (no. of lines or subscribers per 100 inhabitants) of fixed
telephony to about 5%. This expansion of the basic network has been associated with a remarkable
reduction of the waiting list, from more than 107,000 unmet requests in 1993 to about 29,000 in 1997.
The basic telecommunications network in Morocco appears modern and increasingly efficient: the
digitalization rate is very high - close to 100% - and computerized network maintenance, operation and
management tools have been widely introduced. As a result, labor productivity has increased by about
50% between 1993 and 1997, with the ratio of main lines per employee reaching almost 100 by the end of
1997. The fault rate has been progressively reduced, increasing the "mean time between faults" from 1.5
to 2.2 years.
During the 1993-1997 period, a mobile communications network has been deployed in the country, but
despite fairly extensive coverage, at the end of 1997 mobile telephony only reached a niche market with
only 2.7 subscribers per 1000 inhabitants. The ratio between the number of mobile subscribers and the
number of fixed lines has steadily increased over the period, however, and the potential for further
expansion of the number of subscribers is huge, with mobile communications in a position to play a
crucial role in increasing the penetration rate of telecommunications services in the country over the next
decade.
Finally, the gap in access to telecommunications between urban and rural areas remains very important in
Morocco, with penetration rates in Casablanca about 3 to 4 times higher than in the country as a whole.
However, this imbalance appears to be slowly diminishing: penetration rates for the country as a whole
were about 27% of those in Casablanca in 1993; in 1996, that figure had increased to 33%.

From a comparative perspective, the overall penetration rate of fixed telephony is broadly in line with that
observed elsewhere in the region. It is, however, far lower than that of the dynamic emerging economies
considered in the sample, which have 18 or more fixed lines per 100 inhabitants. Network digitalization is
very high by international standards and the number of faults per 100 lines is lower in Morocco than in
most of the countries considered in the sample.
As far as mobile telephony is concerned, Morocco compares favorably with its regional competitors but
mobile penetration is much lower than in emerging economies and very far from that of Portugal and
Ireland, where it exceeds 15%. Comparisons of the mobile/fixed penetration ratio tell a similar story.
While this ratio is higher in Morocco than in Tunisia or Egypt, it is clear that Morocco has only barely
started to tap the potential of mobile communications to expand access to telecommunications services.
While in Malaysia and Portugal there are 40 to 60 mobile subscribers per 100 fixed lines, in Morocco the
ratio is still no more than about 5%.

Post
Over the past five years, the sector has remained relatively stable, with some areas in need of specific
development and improvement. BAM is employing about 8,800 people, handling both basic postal
services and financial services such as checking and savings accounts as well as money orders. Total
postal revenues only represent about 0.25% of GDP, far below international benchmarks which show that
the postal sector generally represents more than 1% of GDP.
The Moroccan postal industry has suffered economic losses throughout the past decade. In 1998,
however, BAM made a profit of about US$8 million and this positive trend is expected to strengthen over
the coming years (Universal Postal Union's (UPU) statistics show that the majority of postal operators
worldwide are profit-making). BAM is expected to benefit from the separation of posts and
telecommunications which became effective in 1998. The exchange of services between the newly
separated IAM and BAM is expected to result, overall, in net payments from LAM to BAM.
During the 1993-1998 period, there has been a slight increase (11%) in the total number of permanent
postal offices. In 1998 there were 1,470 permanent offices each serving an average of 17,737 inhabitants.
Only 44% of the permanent offices in Morocco offer a full range of services, a ratio which has remained
constant since 1993 despite a 13.5% increase in the Government's investment in mail services.
The number of Moroccans receiving mail at home has decreased in recent years. By 1997, 30% of the
population was required to retrieve their mail from a postal establishment while six percent remained
without postal delivery. BAM's intention to explore ways of delegating the provision of postal services in
rural areas to private operators may eventually help to increase the percentage of home delivery and
ensure that 100% of the population is able to receive mail.
BAM's financial services account for approximately 30% of total postal revenues. Since 1993, the
number of postal savings accounts has grown by 54% and the number of checking accounts by 31 %. By
1998 the number of savings accounts (1,030,667) far exceeded the number of checking accounts
(526,901). While total assets held in checking accounts remained stable over the period, total assets held
in savings account substantially increased and by 1998 total savings assets were slightly higher than total
checking assets (US$592 million vs. US$493 million).

When compared with that of the other countries of the sample, Morocco's postal performance falls short
in a number of respects. The average number of deliveries in urban and rural areas is broadly similar in all
countries but the percentage of the population without any postal delivery is higher in Morocco than
elsewhere. In addition, the average number of letter-post items per inhabitant has remained stagnant at
around 7.7 during the 1990s which is well below intemational benchmarks. This indicator to some extent
may reflect the lack of quality (reliability and speed) of the postal service in Morocco which has
prompted some businesses and individuals to use other means to ensure mail delivery (such as private
messenger services).

Information Technology
The share of the IT manufacturing sector in the Moroccan economy remains very limited today, but
appears to be growing relatively fast: IT value-added increased from US$115 million in 1995 to US$149
million in 1997, representing 0.35% of total GDP in 1995 and 0.44% in 1997. Exports of IT equipment
are growing even faster, from US$39.5 mnillion in 1995 (0.57% of merchandise exports) to US$58.9
million in 1997 (1.26%  of merchandise exports). Morocco remains however, a net importer of IT
equipment, as IT imports over the period exceeded US$100 million per year. Employment figures have
remained relatively stable over the period: the sector is absorbing between 7,000 and 7,500 people, which
represents about 1.6% of total employees in industrial sectors.
The number of PC per 10,000 inhabitants is estimated to have increased from about 12 in 1993 to about
22 in 1997. These figures probably underestimate the growth rate as they do not reflect the strong
peTformance of the consumer electronics market in 1998, nor the fact that many PCs are introduced in the
countries through "tax free" ports, and therefore, excluded by official statistics. But it is obvious that PC
penetration remains low, leaving room for substantial expansion in the coming years. This is particularly
clear if one compares the above figures with those relating to the diffusion of TV sets in the country (the
percentage of households with a TV set is now above 75%/o).
As far as services are concerned, the IT sector is still very much under-developed as well, but some
activities at least are now growing at an exponential rate, starting from very low levels. This is the case
for internet services, for example: the numbers of internet hosts and of intemet subscribers remain very
low today (only about 1,400 hosts, and 50 internet subscribers per 1 million inhabitants) but they have
been growing exponentially since the introduction of internet services in Morocco in 1995. The number of
subscribers to public packed data and ISDN networks follow a broadly similar pattern.

Morocco's performance in the IT sector is behind that of its main regional and global competitors. For
example, according to the World Bank Group Competitiveness database (which compiles data on a wide
range of indicators for more than 150 countries on all continents), Morocco ranks after all the countries
considered in our sample as far as PC and fax penetration are concerned, and second to last with respect
to internet penetration.

around 27 percent of the market after two to three years of operation.
Number of suppliers of leased lines. This indicator provides an indirect measure of the openness
of the telecommunications market to effective competition. Indeed, leasing lines constitutes one
of the ways for LAM's competitors to establish their networks (the other ways are building their
own infrastructure or interconnecting with the main operator).
Price of leased 2Mb/sec. circuit on a 300 km distance. This indicator provides a measure of the
impact of competition in the telecommunications market. It will be used to monitor the evolution
over time of the price of a standard measure (2Mb/sec.) of leased lines. International benchmarks
suggest that opening up the market for leased lines to competition would cause the price (per
year) of a 2 Mb/sec. circuit on a 300 km distance to fall from US$30,125 to about US$10,000 in 3
to 4 years.
Price of leased 2Mb/sec. circuit on a 5 km distance. Similarly, the cost of an urban line
(distance of 5 km) could fall from above US$9,000 to US$5,500 in 3 to 4 years.
Number of lines outside Casablanca and Rabat. The indicator will monitor the imbalance
between the two main urban areas and the rest of the country as far as access to
telecommunications services is concerned. An effective universal access scheme is expected to
enable rural access to grow at least at the same pace as urban access, which would result in the
development of more than 150,000 new lines outside those two cities by 2001.
Percentage of the population having access to at least one phone. Another measure of access
is the percentage of population having access to at least one phone (minimal access). The best
indicator would be the actual distance from the households to the closest available phone, but this
measure is not available.
Fault rate. The number of faults per 100 main lines per year is the first measure of the quality
and reliability of the network. Present measures indicate about 40 faults per 100 lines per year.
International benchmarks suggest that the figure might drop, in 2 to 3 years, to 30 faults per 100
lines per year, which is equivalent to a mean time between faults of slightly more than 3 years
(European average is currently about 12.5 faults).
Efficiency of new investment. This indicator tracks the evolution of the efficiency of investment
over time. The ratio for the last three years has been contained between US$1,500 and 2,000 per
subscriber (see Annex VII). The average figure, in Europe, is now below US$1,000.

ANNEX VI
FISCAL IMPACT OF THE REFORMS
The transition toward liberalization and competitive markets in telecommunications will bring
static and dynamic fiscal gains and losses. The present Annex attempts to present quantitative
estimates of the overall fiscal impact of the reforms. These estimates are summarized in table and
graph forms below. The main hypotheses and assumptions used to calculate those estimates are
presented at the end.
Discussion of Main Fiscal Impacts
1. Issuance of a second GSM license. It can be assumed that the proceeds which the Moroccan
Treasury will receive in 1999 from the award of the second GSM license are likely to be
contained within a range of US$250 to 750 million'. Expected revenues are set at 238.1 million in
1998 dollars (US$250 million with a discount rate of 5 percent per year) in a "low case" scenario,
and at 714.3 million in 1998 dollars (US$750 million discounted) in a "high case" scenario.
2. Privatization of IAM. Considering a value between US$800 and US$2,400 per fixed line,2 the
total value of the company would range between US$1.1 and 3.3 billion, excluding the value of
IAM's GSM activities and other corporate operations. Assuming the sale of a 30 percent share of
the company in 2000, proceeds from privatization are estimated at US$299.3 million in the "low
case' scenario and US$ 898 million in the "high case" (in 1998 dollars). This assumption is
highly tentative, however. It does not reflect in any way Government's decisions regarding the
timeframe and modalities of the sale.
3. Phasing-out of the monopoly tax. The monopoly tax levied on IAM was set at 10 percent of
gross revenues until 1997. It will be progressively phased out according to the following
schedule.
Year              1998 1999 2000 2001 2002
Monopoly Tax    8%    6%   4%    2%    0%
At the present time, the monopoly tax provides the State with revenues of about MAD650 million
(US$70 million) per year. Considering a linear growth trend in revenues, the progressive phasing
out of the monopoly tax would lower future tax revenues by a cumulated discounted figure of
about MAD2.277 billion (US$246 million) by the end of 2002.
These figures are meant to define a broad range, within which investors' actual estimates are likely to fall. They are
based on observations of the prices paid for GSM licenses broadly similar to that which is to be awarded in
Morocco. It does not reflect any direct actual economic or financial evaluation of the Moroccan license.
2 Once again, these figures are meant to encompass a broad range which is likely to include actual market valuations
of the company. They are derived from the observation of various privatizations of companies similar IAM. They
do not reflect any direct actual economic or financial evaluation of the company.

The Government could choose to offset the losses arising from the phasing out of the monopoly
tax with a different dividend policy, as long as it remains LAM's main shareholder. However, a
policy of increasing dividend transfers from LAM to the State could not be pursued for long
without jeopardizing the competitiveness of LAM vis-a-vis other operators. Dividends paid by
private telecommunications operators typically vary between 0 percent of profits (during periods
of high investment in the network) and 3 percent of profits. Payment of dividends to compensate
for the loss of a 10 percent tax on gross revenues would therefore clearly be unsustainable.
4. Higher sector revenue taxes, caused by a competition-induced market enlargement.
Competition, as well as market entry by commercially driven operators, will accelerate the rate of
growth of sector revenues, at the moment equal to 7-8 percent a year.3 This will translate into
higher fiscal revenues through VAT and other taxes. Among the new operators, the second GSM
operator, in particular, is expected to become a substantial taxpayer.
The following table presents a prudent estimate of future fiscal gains, under the hypothesis of a
total fiscal burden on revenues of 20 percent (VAT and other taxes on revenue).4
3  Figure presently related to IAM only.
4  The growth in revenues of the GSM operator is derived from the forecast presented in ANRT's Action Plan of
1998. Other sector revenues include estimates of additional revenues that IAM will derive from the additional
traffic generated by the second GSM operator, and estirnates of the revenues of new providers of data (ISPs,
wireless data providers) and GMPCS services.

5. Higher sector profitability. The commercialization and future privatization of LAM,
combined with the entry of new private operators, is likely to increase sector profitability. This
higher profitability will translate into higher profit taxes. At the present time, the profit taxes on
the main operator have risen to a level of about MAD450 million (US$49 million). In the absence
of precise data on lAM's privatization, we can prudently assume, therefore, that in an enlarged
market, the present values of LAM's profit taxes will at least be maintained over time.
As far as new operators are concerned, it is likely that the second GSM operator will become
profitable two to three years after the start of its commercial operations. Therefore, it is prudent to
assume that taxes on the profits of new operators will provide a substantial contribution to the
State budget only after the year 2002.
The following table shows the profit taxes paid by IAM over the last 5 years:

6. Payment of the arrears of the public administration. Public administration arrears vis-a-vis
LAM amount to about MAD 1,019 million (about US$107 million). Assuming that, in the absence
of changes in bill collection practices, the public administration arrears would grow by about



Annex VI
Page 4 of 6
MAD370 million a year (consistent with 1998 figures), the total amount of arrears would rise to
US$224 million by the end of 2001. As indicated in Annex III, the Government is however
committed to reduce IAM's arrears to three months of consumption, i.e. US$13 million.
Assuming that this objective is achieved by the end of 2001 - this assumption is made for
illustration purposes only and does not reflect a policy decision by the Moroccan authorities - this
would imply a cost, for the public administration, of about US$211 million over the period 1999-
2001, i.e. a cost of US$42.2 million per semester from mid-1999 to end-2001 (discounted at a rate
of 5 percent per year in the summary tables presented at the end of the present section).5

7. Introduction of benchmarks on international accounting and settlement rates. Morocco is
currently among the top ten recipients of international settlements, with revenues from
settlements amounting to around 10 percent of lAM's total revenues. As mentioned in the main
text of the Report (see footnote 16), the introduction of benchmarks on accounting and settlement
rates would bring down the prices of international calls and would therefore lower, in the short
term, revenues from international traffic. Demand would, thereafter, react to lower prices,
expanding traffic, and consequently increasing revenues.
In the absence of precise data on both short and long-term elasticity of demand, as well as on
future tariff adjustments (with special regard to the policies to be implemented in France, Italy,
Spain, and the United States, which absorb about 90 percent of the international traffic with
Morocco), it is impossible to come up with meaningful quantitative estimates of the impact of
such policy changes.
The following tables and graph provide an estimate of the fiscal impact of the reforms for the
period 1998-2002. As mentioned above, a "high case" and a "low case" scenarios have been
considered. The high case reflects the highest estimates of the proceeds to be obtained from the

privatization proceeds, since the market value of the assets would increase.

sale of the second GSM license and from IAM's privatization. The low case reflects the lowest
estimates. Since very different figures were chosen for the high and low cases, the results
summarized in the tables and graph are indicative only. In addition, changes in the assumptions
(presented at the end of the Annex) would also affect the results. Uncertainty with respect to the
exact size of the impact of the reform measures grows, in fact, over time, especially after a
horizon of about three years. The general trend presented below is, however, fairly robust: the
reforms entail some net fiscal costs in the very short term; these costs are then more than
compensated by (i) the proceeds from the second GSM license, (ii) progressively increasing tax
revenues, and (iii) privatization proceeds. Finally, beyond the period depicted below, the net
cumulative fiscal impact should remain positive and increase as fiscal revenues keep growing and
more than compensate the loss of the monopoly tax.

Main Assumptions
1. The rate of growth of the revenues of the main operator has been relatively constant over the
last few years at between 7 and 8 percent. The basic model assumes linear revenue growth for the
main operator based on the figures for 1991-1997. The rates of growth of other operators are
assumed to equal the rate of growth of the second GSM operator, which, in turn, is derived from
assumptions 7 and 8.
2. The phasing out of the 10 percent monopoly tax on LAM's total revenue is implemented
through progressive reductions of 2 percent a year from the year 1998. No indirect effects (e.g.,
stimulus to growth) are assumed.
3. Revenues from profit taxes will probably vary over time, in response to higher profitability of
the sector as well as stronger competitive pressures. It is assumed that revenues from profit taxes
will be maintained in real terms at around MAD450 million, reflecting 1995-1997 values.
4. Other taxes and duties on revenues, excluding the monopoly tax, are considered constant over
time, and linearly derived from 1991-1997 time series.
5. In the absence of precise indications from the Government, and without neglecting the
relevance of the issue for the analysis, IAM's dividend policy is assumed to remain constant.
6. The proceeds to be obtained from the sale of the second GSM license and from the
privatization of LAM (high case and low case scenarios) are derived from the assumptions
presented in the text of the above section.
7. Competition and new entry are assumed to increase the overall size of the market by US$360
million by the end of year 2002. This increase includes the revenues generated by the new
operators and the additional revenues that IAM derives from increased traffic.
8. The second GSM operator is able to capture 50 percent of the additional subscribers after one
year of operation; the market share of the second GSM operator, after two to three years of
operation, is about 27 percent.
9. The exchange rate used is US$1=MAD9.25 and the assumed discount rate is 5 percent per
year.

ANNEX VII
TELECOMMUNICATIONS: PAST INVESTMENT AND
CAPITAL EFFICIENCY RATIO
IAM has substantially enlarged and modernized its network in recent years. These achievements
have been made possible by an increase in annual investments, at current prices, from US$37.8
million in 1984 to more than US$330 million in 1996. The figures on investment in real terms
show that the increase has been concentrated in the years 1989 to 1996: befere 1989, investments,
measured at 1984 prices, were contained between US$37 million and US$84 million; after 1989,
investments were in the range of US$160 million to US$250 million, with the exception of the
years 1993 and 1995, when investments in real terms were about US$125 to US$130 million.
Time series of investments and subscribers can be used to evaluate different measures of capital
efficiency. The following table considers 4 different possible measures. MA(0) represents a
capital efficiency ratio, calculated as a 3-year moving average of new investment per additional
subscriber. MA(+1) represents a ratio calculated as a 3-year moving average of new investment
per subscriber added to the network one year after the investment. MA(0)-D  and MA(+1)-D
represent the same ratios but with discounted figures for the new investment. These indicators
show that the efficiency of capital in the Moroccan system has improved over time. New
investment per additional subscriber MA(0) has decreased over time, from more than US$4,000-
in the years 1988-1990, to about US$1,400-2,000 in the years 1994-1996. The other measures of
capital efficiency, calculated considering time lags and discounted values for new  investment,
show similar results.
