1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Industrialization in the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) is a very recent
development and its scope remains limited. Nevertheless, it has an important
role in the country in supplying locally needed manufactured goods, providing
stable employment and harnessing financial resources of th.e private sector,
particularly those accummulated by emigrants. Opportunities exist for further
investment in medium and small size import substitution, local resource based
and, to some extent, export industries. The key constraints are shortage of
viable projects, and inadequate institutional support to promote and finance
projects and to assist entrepreneurs who are willing to invest in industry but
have limited management capability.
1.02     This report appraises a project whose main aim is to address the
above key constraints. The project would help identify about 40 potential
investment opportuniti__ in YAR, followed by preparation of 15 feasibility
studies. It would, through technical assistance, training and other measures,
also strengthen the institutional capacity of the Industrial Bank of Yemen
(IBY) to promote and finance industrial projects. Finally, it would provide
scarce foreign exchange for investment. The project takes into account the
findings and recommendations of the two recent IDA reports: Manufacturing
Industry - Performance, Policies and Prospects (No. 3651) of November 12, 1982
and Mobilization of Domestic Financial Resources (No. 3554-a) of January 6,
1982. It builds on IDA Credit No. 1122-YAR for the First Industrial
Development Project channelled through IBY which was approved on March 26,
1981. The funds under this credit have been fully committed and are being
disbursed. The Project Performance Audit Report is yet to be prepared.

II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Characteristics, Structure and the Government's Policies
2.01     Manufacturing industry (which includes quarrying) forms a small part
of YAP's overall economy, accounting for 7.5% of GDP and 5% of total
employment. Manufacturing output is dominated by food processing (44% of
manufacturing value added), followed by building materials (21%), chemical and
light engineering (10% each), textiles and wood working (5% each) and others
(5%). About 3,000 enterprises are currently registered in the country. Most
of them are very small units and artisans. About 90% employ four or fewer
workers; 7%, between five and nine; and 3%, 10 or more. The majority of these
are concentrated around the three major cities; Sanaa (41%), Taiz (26%) and
Hodeida (14%). The private sector dominates the manufacturing sector with the
Government owning a handful of large enterprises, including textiles, cement,
tobacco, drugs and flour milling. The institutional support structure
consists of the Ministry of Economy and Industry (MEI), more specifically its
Department of Industry (DI), which has the overall responsibility for
industrial research, planning, development and regulation. It has established
two specialized agencies; the Industrial Estates Development Authority (IEDA),
in 1973, to provide physical infrastructure and IBY, in 1976, to provide
development finance.
2.02     As seen from the performance of the industrial sector (para 2.03),
the policy package for the sector has proved adequate. The basic policy for
governing the industrial sector is contained in Law No. 18 of 1975, which
encourages an open door policy towards foreign firms, and guarantees
repatriation of corporate profits of foreign holdings. The industrial
incentives include exemption from import tariffs on equipment and spare parts;
a tax holiday and 25% reduction in import tariffs on raw materials and
intermediate goods (both for five years). Quantitative import restrictions
and price controls are minimal. Import tariffs, primarily seen as a source of
the Government revenue, are in general low. The Government's licencing
procedures have been kept to a minimum. The Government allows employment of
foreign technicians and skilled workers, where necessary.
B. Past Performance, The Second Five Years Plan and Recent Trends
2.03     Aided by rising living standards and an adequate policy framework,
industrial manufacturing activity increased rapidly during the second half of
the 1970s. Industrial value added and investment each increased in real terms
by about 12% per annum (p.a.) compared to 6% p.a. for total GDP, and
industrial fixed assets by 24% p.a. also in real terms. Employment increased
by 10% p.a. Food processing and building materials have been the major growth
subsectors and contribute most to the manufacturing output (para 2.01). The
major impetus to industry came from the private sector, fueled by worker
remittances, and also to some extent, from public sector projects financed by
aid. The manufacturing investment growth rate in the 1980s is estimated to
remain at about 12% p.a. in real terms.



- 3 -
2.04     Despite its quick growth, the sector suffered from several problems,
many of which persist today. Most prominent is the weak institutional support
structure for industry. The DI has only 10 professionals with limited
experience. A UNIDO team, which was to provide technical assistance (TA) to
the DI, had a modest impact due to several reasons including overambitious
terms of reference, inadequate number and quality of TA personnel, frequent
changes in work priorities by MEI and poor counterpart support. Under this
situation and the absence of a well developed financial intermediary, many
projects were poorly prepared, implemented and managed. IEDA also did not
develop as expected; it was not able to demonstrate the replicability of the
Sanaa industrial estate financed by IDA (Credit 465-YAR) nor was it able to
become financially viable (para 2.14).
2.05     There were other problems.  High inflation together with a fixed
exchange rate and an open economy made some industries uncompetitive with
respect to imports. Water and power shortages worsened and enterprises began
to rely on their own, and often high cost and uneconomic, facilities. Due to
labor emigration to Gulf countries, labor costs increased by 40X p.a.,
reaching t5,300 p.a. in 1981-82 for an unskilled worker. The resulting move
towards capital intensive industries required skilled manpower, which was even
scarcer, and had to be imported at a high cost. The capital intensity of
investments, however, itself is not an issue in YAR. It reflects a natural
shift in the balance of factors of production. I8B's experience shows that
even small and r.edium entrepreneurs prefer automated production processes to
reduce requirements of high cost labor. YAR is not suffering unemployment
problem and attempt to direct investments towards labor intensive technologies
is not desirable since it could lead to distortions in the industrial sector.
Given this, Credit 1122-YAR nor the proposed project include maximum limits on
investment cost per job for subprojects financed.
2.06     Under the Second Five Year Plan (SFYP: 1982-86), industrial
investment was forecast at $731 million or 12% of the total plan investment,
while industrial output was expected to increase at 14% p.a., as compared to
the planned GDP growth rate of 7% p.a. Of the total industrial investment,
two-thirds was expected in public and mixed sectors (majority Government
owned) and the remaining in the private sector.
2.07     Due to external economic factors, primarily the decline in aid (para.
3.08), the SFYP industrial targets, particularly those relating to the public
and mixed sectors, are unlikely to be achieved. The Government is giving
priority to import-substitution in productive sectors, mainly agriculture,
industry and energy. Also, given the financial constraints and the
Government's liberal market orientation, private investment is strongly
encouraged. At the Government's request, IDA sent a mission to review the
Public Investment Program under the SFYP and made a number of recommendations
for reducing and reforming sectoral investment programs, which have been
discussed and broadly agreed upon.
2.08     The SFYP document also underlines the need to identify viable
projects. About 70% of the industrial investment envisaged in the SFYP was
for new projects for which no study had been initiated. The Government must
address this problem on a priority basis. The private sector, which would be
expected to implement the bulk of these new projects, needs technical,
managerial, and financial assistance to carry out the necessary studies.

C. Development Constraints, Prospects and Strategy
2.09      YAR's industrialization constraints fall into three broad areas,
none of which are unusual in LDCs, but are rarely found together and to such a
degree. First, poor endowment of natural resources and small and dispersed
domestic markets. Second, weak entrepreneurial capability, severe shortage
and high cost of skilled and managerial manpower and poor physical
infrastructure, which can only be resolved over a long period of time through
technical assistance and training to upgrade skills and productivity and
through investment in infrastructure. Third, lack of viable projects and
inadequate institutional support to promote and finance such projects and to
actively assist enterpreneurs in project planning, implementation and
operations.
2.10     The overall prospects for industrialization in the YAR are limited.
Yet, analysis of economic growth potentials and prospects suggests that
investment opportunities exist in six major industrial subsectors: food
processing, building materials, household and light chemicals and plastics,
light engineering, wood working and service industries (workshops). The type
of industries most likely to be established would be in import-substitution.
2.11     Against this background, the industrial strategy in the YAR at its
present phase of development should have three elements:
a)   to focus on efficient import-substitution projects which, in
particular: (i) manufacture products enjoying natural protection
(high ratio of transport cost to import price); (ii) maximize
domestic value added; and (iii) develop the use of domestic resources,
b)   to build institutional capacity to (i) identify and prepare viable
projects, and (ii) promote and finance them through assistance to
entrepreneurs during project planning, implementation and operations,
and
c)   to promote development of technical skills and alleviate physical
infrastructure bottlenecks.
2.12     The Government's industrial strategy is in accordance with the
above.  It has agreed to systematically identify investment opportunities and
to prepare feasibility studies in the six subsectors listed in para 2.10.
These studies would be financed under the proposed project (para 4.08 and 5.02
a). It has also decided to give IBY a somewhat wider role in the industrial
sector: in addition and complementary to its financial intermediation role,
IBY would be expected as an agent of the Governement to identify, prepare and
promote projects for the private sector.
2.13     IDA supports the Government's intentions regarding the expanded
functions of IBY. Under the aegis of the MEI, IBY is the most suitable
institution at present to play an effective developmental role in the
industrial sector. Over the years, it has developed extensive contacts with
industry and entrepreneurs look to it for guidance. However, IBY is a



-5-
relatively fragile institution and its staff capabilities and financial
situation need to be considerably improved in order to meet its new
institutional objectives. IBY's performance and prnposed measures to
strengthen it are discussed in detail in Chapter IV.
D. IDA's Past and Ongoing Operations in the Manufacturing Sector
2.14     IDA has maintained a positive and substantive dialogue with the YAR
Government on manufacturing sector issues: (i) IDA Report - Manufacturing
Industry: Performance, Policies and Prospects (No. 3651-YAR of November 12,
1982) - resulted in an interchange of views on significant aspects and
problems confronting industry, primarily in private manufacturing but also
covering public sector units. It has provided the rationale for including
project identification, preparation and promotion activities as part of the
proposed project. (ii) At the Government's invitation, IDA undertook a review
of the country's draft Second Five Year Plan. As regards the industrial
strategy of the Plan, IDA made a number of general recommendations for
attracting private to investment to projects which had been 'reserved' for the
public sector. These recommendations are being pursued in the context of the
Public Investment Program review (para 2.07). (iii) IDA Report on
Mobilization of Domestic Financial Resources (No. 3554a-YAR of January 6,
1982) included a discussion of interest rate structure for long-term lending
institutions and their role in resource mobilization. (iv) An IDA credit
(Credit 465-YAR) of $2.3 million the Industrial Estate Development Authority
(IEDA) for Sanaa industrial estate was approved in January, 1974 and closed in
December 1982. The industrial estate is experiencing serious financial,
managerial and operational difficulties. Although the project has been
completed and the credit closed on December 31, 1982, IDA is continuing
discussions with the Government on IEDA's future. A Project Completion Report
has been prepared examining options for IEDA. (v) A line of credit of SDRs
9.7 million for the First Industrial Development (Credit 1122-YAR) was
provided to IBY in 1981 to meet its financial and technical assistance needs.
IBY's experience while utilizing this credit line has emphasized the need for
systematic project promotion and implementation follow up (Chapter IV). (vi)
An IDA seconded senior advisor was appointed in January 1982 for two years to
provide technical assistance and organizational assistance to IBY's senior
management. During his tenure, he advised IBY towards more rational lending
policies to improve appraisal standards and to set up a project supervision
system. Strong emphasis was placed on training, particularly of IBY
management. As a result, management gained a better understanding of IBY's
development role in the national context.

III. FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. Structure, Operations and Resource Mobilization and Allocation
3.01     Structure and Operations.  The banking system in the YAR has
developed largely in the last decade and is still in its early formative
stages. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY), established in 1971, performs the
traditional role of the Government's banker, oversees commercial banks,
controls foreign exchange and sets interest rates in the country. CBY's total
assets at the end of 1983 were YRl 13.3 billion.
3.02     There are 10 commercial banks, with a network of 60 branches and with
total assets of YRI 7.4 billion at the end of 1983. The Government controlled
Yemen Bank for Reconstruction and Development (YBRD) is by far the largest,
with 62% of the total commercial banks' assets. The remaining nine commercial
banks are either partly or wholly foreign owned or branches of foreign hanks.
The largest share of credit from commercial banks is short-term lending for
financing trade and import (para 3.05). Investment banking activities are
very limited and there are no capital and money markets in YAR.
3.03     To provide long-term financial assistance to priority sectors, the
Government established three specialized financial institutions with majority
state ownership: the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) in 1975, IBY in 1976, and
the Housing Credit Bank (HCB) in 1977. A Cooperative Bank was established in
1980 under the auspices of the Confederation of Yemeni Local Development
Associations 1/. In addition, Yemen Company for Investment and Finance tYCIF)
was established by YBRD in 1981, initialLy, to handle its portfolio of
long-term investments; YCIF is now eager to go into term financing for
industry but lacks technical and financial resources. These institutions are
relatively small compared to commercial banks; their total assets of YRl one
billion at the end of 1983 represent about 4.5% of the banking sector assets.
ACB has offices in each province, IBY has one in Taiz and HCB has none.
3.04     Although precise data is not available, a considerable part of
financial transactions in the country is reported to be handled by unofficial
channels and licenced money changers. This reflects both the insufficient
penetration of the rural areas by the official financial institutions and
preference of emigrants for direct remittance flows through the unofficial
channels. With the recent increasing pressure on the country's foreign
exchange situation (para 3.08), remittances through the unofficial channels
and money changers have reportedly increased.
3.05     Resource Mobilization and Allocation.  Private deposits, mainly
domestic and emigrants savings, are the major financial source for commercial
banks. Sources of funds of specialized banks are equity, long-term domestic
and foreign borrowings. Since 1979, commercial bank deposits, most of which
1/ The Cooperative Bank and the Agricultural Credit Bank were merged in 1981
to form Cooperative and Agricultural Credit Bank (CACB).



-7-
are short-term, have increased by 15% p.a. in real terms to reach YRI 4.7
billion in 1983, leaving them highly liquid. Since 1979, the total
outstanding credit has increased by 3.6% p.a. in real terms to reach YRI 3.3
billion in 1983. Commercial banks now account for 87% of outstanding credit,
of which 10% is medium and long-term (MLT) and 902 is short-term (ST) credit.
Total ?4LT credit including credit granted by specialized institutions has
increased much more rapidly than ST credit over the past five years (18.0%
p.a. versus 2.3% p.a.). The low base and the expansion of the specialized
banks activities, together with public enterprise financing by YBRD, account
for the high MLT credit growth rate. In future, given their high liquidity,
commercial banks can be expected to play a greater role in MLT financing
operations, particularly in industry.
B. Industrial Finance
3.06     At the end of 1983, the total industrial credit outstanding was
estimated to be about YRI 301 million, or about 9% of all credit extended in
YAR. However, this figure is underestimated due to the fact that it excludes
trade credit for imported industrial goods and direct borrowings and suppliers
credits for industry. These cannot be estimated for lack of data. Subject to
these considerations, out of the total industrial credit outstanding at the
end of 1983, about 51% was for ST from commercial banks and the remaining 49%
was for MLT, mainly from IBY (para 3.07). Banks, mainly YCIF, also hold some
equity portfolio in industry and guarantees for overseas loans. At the end of
1982, YCIF's equity investment in industry amounted to YRI 17 million in three
enterprises and guarantees amounted to YRI 10 million in 10 enterprises.
IBY's equity portfolio at the end of 1983 was YRI 7.5 million.
3.07     IBY's Role in Industrial Finance.  At the time of the approval of the
first credit to IBY, IBY's financial assistance to the industrial sector was
small due to its recent creation (staff Appraisal Report No. 3211 of February
17, 1981). The large and medium projects were financed generally through
personal resources of their sponsors, borrowings from local and foreign
commercial banks and suppliers credits. Small scale industry relied almost
entirely on self-financing. But the situation has changed during the past
three years. Although still small in absolute terms, IBY now occupies a
dominant position in the supply of MLT credit for YAR's industry. At the end
of 1983, it accounted for YRI 96 million (or 67%) of the total outstanding
industrial NffT credit of YRI 148 million. More important, it is the principal
agency for providing scarce foreign exchange for small and medium industries,
which do not have direct access to overseas sources. Furthermore, IBY
financing also acts as a catalyst for mobilizing the resources of private
sector for investment. During the past three years, investment in IBY
financed projects amounted to about YR1 350 million, which was about 40% of
the manufacturing investment in the country. Finally, IBY has assisted small
scale industry which received little institutional finance prior to 1980.
During the past three years, although the amount of commitments for small
scale projects (investment less than YRI 100,000) were only about 3.4% of
IBY's total commitments, their number was 33% of all projects approved.



-8-
C. Foreign Exchange Situation
3.08     The YAR enjoyed a comfortable foreign exchange situation during the
second half of 1970s. But the situation has deteriorated since the early
1980s, because of the continued rise in imports and decline in foreign aid.
The Government's response to the emerging foreign exchange situation has been
pragmatic. It has formed an Import Licencing and Rationalization Committee
(ILRC) comprised of the Ministry of Supply, MEI and CBY. The ILRC assesses
the economyts import needs and allocates the required foreign exchange to
importers. This process, once a formality, has become more restrictive;
priority is being given to import of food, raw materials, spare parts and
machinery. The procedure is working satisfactorily. The Government has also
begun to adjust the exchange rate. For 11 years the Yemeni Rial was pegged to
the US dollar at a rate of $1 = YRI 4.45. Since early 1984, the Rial was
devalued five times and is now valued at $1 = YRI 5.90, which is close to the
market rate.
3.09     Implications for Industry.  In general, the above policy and exchange
rate measures are likely to benefit the economy in terms of increased
remittances through banking and restoring the competitiveness of some local
industries, by making imports more expensive. But the sudden adjustment in
exchange rate has meant a very large (over 25%) increase in repayment charges
on foreign currency loans outstanding in 1984, as is the case for majority of
subloans granted under Credit 1122-YAR. As regards the future, it has been
assumed that the depreciation of the Rial would be proportionate to the
difference in the projected inflation rates between YAR and its major trading
partners; this is reasonable considering that the Government has begun to
frequently adjust the exchange rate to reflect market conditions (para 3.08).
On this basis and considering that disbursements and repayments under the
proposed project are expected to begin in late 1985 and 1986 respectively, the
foreign exchange risk on funds under this project would be about 4% p.a.
Under Credit 1122-YAR, IBY has been passing the foreign exchange risk to its
subborrowers. This would continue under the proposed project (para 5.17).
D. Interest Rates
3.10     Commercial banks lend only in local currency and their rates do not
vary with the terms of maturity. The commercial bankst interest rate
structure, which has prevailed for the past two years, is as follows; The
lending rate for all types of commercial loans is 15% p.a. Time deposit rates
range from 9.5% p.a. for three months to 12% p.a. for 12 months, the savings
rate for deposits of more than 12 months is 7% p.a. In general, the
commercial bank rate structure has reflected the euromarket situation, though
with a time lag. Given the level of inflation of above 10% p.a., this
structure is satisfactory.
3.11     IBY provides MLT loans in local and foreign currency but no
distinction is made for terms of maturity or for type of currency. IBY's
current lending rate, agreed under Credit 1122-YAR is 11% p.a. (10% p.a.
interest rate plus 1% p.a. service charge), with the subborrowers bearing the
foreign exchange risk. Under the proposed credit, IBY's lending rate would be



- 9 -
set at 4% below the local commercial bank lending rate published quarterly by
the CBY, with the foreign exchange risk continuing to be passed on to IBY's
subborrowers. Once a subloan is committed at a certain rate, however, the
rate would remain unchanged for the life of the subloan. According to this
proposal IBY's lending rate would oe initially set at 11% p.a. (15% charged by
local commercial banks minus 4Z differential), which would be the same as
under credit 1122-YAR. This proposal would allow IBY's lending rate to
fluctuate in accordance with local commercial banks, which are the main
alternatives for Yemeni industrial borrowers. This system of variable rates
is particularly desirable in an environment where there are significant
interest rate fluctuations as has been the case in recent years and as may
well continue in the eighties as long as there are no restrictions on capital
flows in the YAR. Thus, the proposal would bring IBY closer to the principle
of interest rate variability to reflect market conditions. It would also
address IDA's view that an appropriate lending rate for IBY should take into
account the cost of alternative resources. The weighted average of
eurocurrency short-term rates for a basket of currencies of the countries of
likely procurement under the proposed credit would be 10-11% p.a. It is
difficult to assess the premium IBY would have to pay over commercial rates
because of YAR's lack of access to the eurocurrency markets; a rate of 11%
p.a. would not be unreasonable. At this level, the cost of funds to
subborrowers would be comparable to the normal domestic rate of 15% p.a. of
competing local institutions on the basis of an estimated foreign exchange
risk of the order of 4Z p.a. (para 3.09). Tne cost of funds to subborrowers
would be substantially above the expected inflation of 10% p.a.
3.12     A possible risk under this proposal is that if the domestic inflation
and hence local rates increase significantly with respect to international
inflation, IBY's effective rate to subborrowers would become uncompetitive
with respect to the commercial bank rate where no foreign exchange risk is
involved. However, this possibility is slim assuming continuation of
pragmatic open economic policies that the Government has followed in the past
as reflected in IDA's projected inflation rate for YAR which is stable around
10% p.a. Nonetheless, to ensure that this concern is properly addressed, and
that IBY's rate would not become subsidized in the unlikely event that the
Government were to decide to keep local rates at artifically low levels,
agreement has been reached during negotiations to review IBY's lending rate
and the interest rate differential, currently 4% p.a. (para 3.11), on an
annual basis, the first review to be held in December, 1985.

IV. THE INSTITUTION - INDUSTRIAL BANK OF YEMEN (IBY)
A. Institutional Aspects
4.01     IBY's institutional structure has remained essentially the same since
the approval of Credit 1122-YAR. The structure is described in Annex 1 and
highlights are given below. IBY was incorporated in 1976 as an autonomous
institution to promote and assist through financial and technical assistance
the establishment of industrial proje=ts in YAR. The Act and By-laws
(available in Project File) set out IBY's objectives, powers, capital
structure, operational provisions, and Board and management functions. In
1980, IBY adopted a Policy Statement which was drafted with IDA's assistance.
The Statement defines IBY's role in industrial development, prescribes project
selection and financing criteria and spells out credit limits. The Governuent
holds 70% of the authorized share capital of YR1 100 million as ordinary
shares. The distribution of the balance of 30%, which is reserved for the
private sector as preference shares, is as follows: The German Investment
Company (DEG) - 6Z, YBRD - 5%, over 2000 enterprises and individuals - 11.7%,
and unsold - 7."2. IBY is negotiating the sale of unsold preference shares to
an Arab financial institution. In addition to the equity, IBY's long-term
resources consist of borrowings from foreign sources, primarily IDA credit
(1122-YAR) of SDRs 9.7 million approved in 1981 and the Kuwait Fund loan of
Din 4 million (about $12 million) approved in 1983.
4.02     The overall policy and activities are directed by the Board of
Directors, which consists of seven members; the Chairman, who is also the
Chief Executive (Managing Director), 4 ex-officio representatives appointed by
the Government and two representatives of local commercial banks and private
sector preference shareholders. In 1981, IBY appointed a General Manager to
cope with the increasing level of activities. IBY is organized into five
functional departments: (i) Projects for appraisal and supervision;(ii)
Finance and Accounting; (iii) Administration; (iv) Legal and (v) Planning and
Research. The total staff of 55 includes 18 graduate professionals, 22
diploma/secondary school level and 15 supporting staff. IBY has four advisors
(para 4.11).
4.03     The overall legal and administrative structure has proved adequate as
seen from IBY's progress since IDA's approval of Credit 1122-YAR. IBY has
emerged as a dominant institution for industrial finance (para 3.07). Many
subborrowers are repeaters and look to IBY for guidance, which indicates their
overall satisfaction with its services. IBY's senior management has gained
considerable experience in DFC operations. Staff, though needing experience
is qualified and stable. The staff stability is partly due to preference for
public sector employment but, nonetheless, noteworthy considering the severe
shortage of skills in the country. The quality of appraisal reports has
improved, particularly in the financial area.



- l1 -
4.04     The first IDA credit has basically allowed IBY to establish itself as
a financial intermediary. However, to perform a more effeLtive development
role (para 2.13), it needs to be substantially strengthened in terms of
institution and finances. With IDA's assistance, IBY has developed a
comprehensive and suitable program to achieve this objective. The program is
to be implemented as part of the proposed project. The institutional
measures, their linkage with the proposed project and the status of their
implementation are described below. The financial measures are summarized in
para. 4.30.
Institutional Development Program
4.05     Changes in the Act.  Under Credit 1122-YAR (Section 3.04), the
Government had agreed to change IBY's act by June 30, 1981 as follows: (i) to
treat the Government loans as debt for calculation of debt/equity ratio; (ii)
in the absence of IBY's chairman, to delegate his responsibilities so as to
ensure the uninterrupted conduct of IBY's Board functions; and (iii) to permit
IBY to take a pari-passu charge on the assets of its subborrowers, instead of
the existing Act which requires IBY to take first charge. The above changes
required the approval of the People's Assembly (Parliament), but this was not
achieved. IBY has since proposed an additional change: to increase IBY's
lending limit from 10 to 15% of its equity, enabling it to finance larger
projects. IBY and IDA consider these changes as essential to improve IBY's
overall management effectiveness and lending and resource mobilization
capability. The Cabinet has approved all of the above changes in October,
1984. Thne People's Assembly approval is now expected in April-May, 1985.
Given their importance and considering the delays in the past, enactment of
the amendments would be a condition of effectiveness.
4.06     Economic Appraisal of Subprojects.  IBY has prepared economic
evaluation for all subprojects financed under Credit 1122-YAR, where subloan
amount exceeded $300,000. The economic rates of return have been above 20Z.
The methodology, which uses border prices, is satisfactory. To ensure
continued and proper selectivity in subprojects it finances, IBY has now
agreed to prepare economic evaluation for and to use a cut off Economic Rate
of Return of 12% for all subprojects with subloans made by it exceeding
$300,000. The above change has been incorporated in the 1980 Policy Statement
developed in consultation with IDA, which is currently in force.
4.07     As under the previous credit, IBY would consult IDA prior to any
changes in the By-Laws of 1977 (para 4.01) and the Policy Statement.
4.08     Project Identification, Preparation and Promotion Activity.  IBY has
made the identification, preparation and promotion of new projects the primary
function of its Planning and Research department (PRD) and has adopted its
functions and responsibilities (Annex 2). It would hire short-term
consultants for project identification and preparation of feasibility
studies. It would also hire an advisor for project promotion on a two-year
contract and two local counterparts. Terms of reference of the consultant for
identification studies and of the promotion advisor, developed with IDA's
assistance, are given in Annexes 3 and 4 respectively. IBY is in the process



- 12 -
of selecting a suitable consultant in accordance with IDA Guidelines. Annex 5
shows the schedul- for implementation of this function. As a condition of
effectiveness, IBY should have appointed the consultant for the project
identification studies and the promotion advisor (a consulting company and an
individual respectively). IBY has appointed the director (local staff) of
PRD. His qualifications and experience are satisfactory. The second
counterpart, a statistician, is expected to be appointed by June 30, 1985.
4.09     Project  Follow-up.  Recognizing the need to organize an effective
follow-up system, IBY has decided that it would upgrade its follow-up section,
currently under the Projects department, to a separate department reporting to
the General Manager. The existing follow-up staff of two professionals and
the recently reassigned full time advisor have been transferred to the new
department. IBY has also decided to appoint two additional professionals,
including an engineer, to the department by June 30, 1985. The proposed
staffing level would be adequate for IBY's current follow-up requirements.
Ihe need for additional staffing in the Follow-up department would be
periodically reviewed. IBY's Board has approved the formation of a separate
Follow-up department reporting to the General Manager and adopted the agreed
functions and resposibilities and program to improve follow-up (Annex 6). The
program would include organization of project data, planning of site visits,
reporting formats and review procedures. Such program should enable IBY to
supervise subprojects under construction every 2-3 months and subprojects in
operation every 3-12 months. During negotiations, IBY's agreement has also
been obtained on the rehabilitation programs of six enterprises in serious
difficulty, which account for about 45Z of IBY's arrears (para 4.24).
4.10     Staff fcr Appraisal.  IBY has recently recruited two economists/
financial analysts in the Projects department bringing their total strength to
five. IBY would also recruit one engineer by June 30, 1985, to bring total to
three. This is adequate considering the expected level of project lending
activities.
4.11     Advisory Services.  Currently, IBY has an economic and an engineering
advisor in the Project department, a finaacial advisor and an advisor for
follow-up. They are financed by British and German aid, and the Kuwait Fund.
The advisors are performing satisfactorily. Their current contracts are due
to expire between December, 1985 - June, 1986. While IDA supports IBY's
long-term goal to reduce its dependence on foreign advisors, it is clear that
IBY would continue to need the existing level of advisory services for the
next three to four years during which counterparts are expected to be
trained. Agreement has been reached during negotiations that the Government
and IBY would ensure that not less than the present level of advisory services
is maintained during the implementation of the proposed project.
4.12     Training.  IBY would have seven professional staff trained abroad,
through short-term courses, during 1985 through 1986. The proposed project
would finance this training. The General Manager would visit several
development banks to study management aspects of the development banking
function. Two staff, already identified, would be trained in project
appraisal work. One staff each, also identified, would be trained in project
promotion and legal work. Training of two remaining staff, yet to be
identified, would be organized in future depending on further training needs.

B. Operations
4.13     IBY's main area of operations continues to be long-term loans (more
than three years), though it has also given some guarantees and made equity
investments. The operations are summarized below:
Table 2: IBY's Summary of Operations
Approvals                   (in YR1 million)

Source: IBY
1/ Data for 18 month due to change in IBY's fiscal year.
4.14     Long-Term Loans.  The long term loans, which are for capital
expenditure of subprojects financed by IBY, have increased at an average
annual rate of 19% in nominal terms during the past five years. The high
growth rate indicates IBY's rapid development as an important financial
intermediary in YAR.
4.15     The average commitment/approval ratio in a given year has been about
80Z and the average disbursement/commitment ratio has been 88%, with allowance
for annual fluctuations due to a bunching effect. This is satisfactory.
4.16     In accordance with the general trends in YAR (para 2.05), IBY's
portfolio is biased towards projects which are relatively capital intensive.
Of the total approvals during the past three years, 33% have been for projects
with investment costs in excess of YRI 7 million, 45% between YR1 5 and 7
million and 22% below YR1 5 million. Projects financed by IBY were primarily
of medium scale, as small entrepreneurs prefer self-financing. Also, due to
the high administrative costs, IBY has not actively cultivated small
entrepreneurs. In line with the overall regional distribution of industry
(para 2.01), IBY's portfolio is concentrated around Sanaa (63% of the total
subloan amount), Hodeida (22%) and Taez (11%). The portfolio also generally
reflects the relative growth of subsectors: construction materials (46%),
food processing (26%), chemicals and plastics (16%), metal products (10%).
4.17     Guarantees and Investments.  In general, IBY has treated guarantees
and equity investments with caution and preferred loans instead. The two
guarantees given in the past were for suppliers credits, where entrepreneurs
had secured favorable terms compared to IBY. Equity investments have been



- 14 -
taken in YCIF and in three manufacturing projects, two of which are in the
mixed sector and one in the public sector. The position on guarantees has
been satisfactory, but return on equity investments has been disappointing.
The equity investments portfolio is expected to remain small until IBY's
financial situation permits greater exposure.
C. IBY's Financial Situation
4.18     Financial Position.  IBY's comparative audited Balance Sheets and
Income Statements for the 1981-83 period are given in Annexex 7 and 8
respectively. IBY's total assets reached YRI 146 million at the end of 1983.
During the past three years, its long-term loan and investment portfolio
increased by 29Z p.a. in nominal terms to reach YR1 105 million in 1983. The
long-term debt/equity ratio increased from 0.1 in 1981 to 0.3 in 1983. The
liquidity is high (para 4.19). As of December 31, 1983, the liquidity,
measured as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, was 5.0. Also
as of that date, provisions for possible losses were 6% of the outstanding
portfolio, a rather low proportion considering weaknesses in the portfolio
(para 4.22). Further, profitability of 2.1% of paid in capital was low (para.
4.27).
4.19     The main source of liquidity is IBY's equity, which is difficult to
invest because of lack of demand for local currency resources. Admittedly,
IBY's need for liquid funds is somewhat larger than comparable DFCs because
its subloans, primarily from foreign funds, often involve long reimbursement
periods. Yet, the liquidity is excessive. Also, although surplus funds are
profitably deposited in commercial banks, this is not an efficient use of the
available resources from the point of IBY's development objectives. Measures
are being taken under this project to use local resources for investment. At
present on an average, IBY financing covers only the foreign exchange costs of
subprojects. IBY is being encouraged to consider local currency subloans to
finance local expendituzes, thereby absorbing some of the liquidity. IBY's
local currency subloans are expected to increase from the current level of
about YRI 12 million p.a. to about YR1 20 million p.a. by 1988. Although
IBY's experience is limited, it is also considering provision of local
currency subloans for working capital and equity investments.

4.21     High arrears and low profitability require remedial actions.
4.22     Arrears.  IBY's arrears situation is summarized below:

Analysis shows that a relatively small number of subprojects (ten in Category
2 and seven in Category 3 out of the total portfolio of over 110 subprojects)
account for 69% of IBY's total arrears. The ten subprojects in Category 2 are
closed or operating at low capacities and are facing serious marketing,
financial, technical and managerial difficulties. Nine out of the 10
subprojects are to be rehabilitated under the proposed project (para 4.24).
The seven subprojects in Category 3 are closed and under court litigation.
One of the subprojects in category 2 and all of those under litigation have no



- 17 -
prospects for rehabilitation. The subloan amount of YR 10.8 million due from
these subprojects may be considered as IBY's potential doubtful debt, although
much of it is recoverable by sale of assets (particularly land), subject to
favorable Court settlement.
4.23     Several factors are responsible for IBY's arrears.  The debt
repayment discipline in YAR is weak; other financial institutions also suffer
from high arrears. Further, some of the serious cases in IBY's portfolio were
approved prior to Credit 1122-YAR at the Government's direction. There were
also temporary delays in early 1984 in the issuing of import licences to
industries following the establishement of new licencing procedures by the
Government in response to the deteriorating foreign exchange situation. This
led to production difficulties in enterprises and to a slowdown in the growth
of IBY's portfolio. Nonetheless, high arrears do reflect IBY's initial
weaknesses in appraisal in some cases and limited follow up and debt
collection efforts in general.
4.24     IBY management is giving priority to bringing arrears under control.
The penalty rate of interest was raised from 1 to 5%, thus bringing the
interest rate, including penalty, to commercial banks' levels. IBY is setting
up a special unit for debt collection consisting of two persons in Sanaa and
one in Taez under the direct supervision of the General Manager. Procedures
have been set up to prepare arrears report periodically.  Six cases facing
genuine difficulties have been rescheduled. Subloan maturities are now
generally longer.  To a large extent, these measures are responsible for the
reduction in arrears in Category 1 and they would continue in future.
Furthermore, IBY has prepared rehabilitation programs for the 10 serious cases
(Category 2), which account for 45% of IBY's total arrears. Programs for each
of the 10 enterprises were agreed during negotiations and are available in
Project File. They range from management overhaul to rehabilitation of
physical facilities, rescheduling and court action. Their implementation
would be closely followed. Also, the improvements proposed in IBY's follow-up
system should serve as early warning to IBY to spot emerging problems among
enterprises before they reach serious levels and should help reduce arrears.
4.25     As regards the future, arrears in category 1 should fall
significantly, although the overall level is unlikely to contract rapidly
because of the compounding effects of arrears in Categories 2 and 3. Arrears
will, therefore, remain a serious issue for IBY for next 2-3 years. The level
of arrears over three months as a ratio of IBY's portfolio is expected to be
about 12% at the end of 1985, 8% by 1986 and 5% by 1987.
4.26     In spite of the present high level of arrears, IBY's financial
position remains sound: (i) IBY's subloans are covered by a large margin of
security; (ii) the provisions for losses and the general reserve (YR 6.2 and
8.9 million at the end of 1983 respectively) fully cover the subloans due from
Category 3 subprojects, which represent 'doubtful debt' (YR 10.8 million, para
4.22); and (iii) With the proposed improvements in the follow-up system and
the rehabilitation programs for 10 problem enterprises, the arrears situation
should improve. To protect IBY further against risk of its portfolio, during
negotiations, it has been agreed that IBY would increase by December 31, 1988,
its provisions for losses to 8% of the outstanding portfolio and maintain it
as long as the arrears exceed that level. In addition, IBY has agreed during
negotiations to take measures for reducing its level of arrears to below 12%
by the end of 1985, 8% by 1986 and 5% by the end of 1987.



- 18 -
4.27     Profitability.  IBY's profitability has declined from 6.2Z of the
paid in capital in 1981 to 2.1% in 1983. The decline has been the result of
IBY's low spread. Under Credit 1122-YAR, the spread was expected to be about
5% p.a. during 1981 through 83, which was based on the spread of 3% provided
on the IDA credit and of 6.5% on the Kuwait Fund loan. There was also a large
cushion on equity which was provided by the Government at no cost. In fact,
the actual spread during these years was little over 32 p.a. because of the
delayed effectiveness of the Kuwait Fund loan, and a reduction of the
effective spread under the Kuwait Fund loan to about 3.75% p.a.; the balance
being allocated to a technical assistance fund.
4.28     Analysis shows that IBY's spread on all long-term borrowings must be
maintained at least at 5% p.a. during the next 3-4 years to earn profits in
the satisfactory range of 5-7% on paid in capital. The spread requirement is
high though not unreasonable given IBY's particular circumstances; Ci) the
general high salary levels in YAR (para 2.05), (ii) small portfolio (scale
economies) (para 4.06), and (iii) the need to build up provisions for losses
because of weaknesses in portfolio (para 4.22-4.26). When rehabilitation
prograns for problem enterprises are substantially implemented (para 4.24) and
as the portfolio increases with the increasing level of operations (para
4.33), IBY's spread requirements should decline to an acceptable 3-4% p.a.
4.29     To provide IBY with the required spread, it has been agreed during
negotiations that the Government onlending rate to IBY under IDA funds would
be set at 5% p.a. below IBY's prevailing lending rate (para 3.11). Thus, the
onlending rate would also fluctuate in accordance with IBY's lending rate to
subborrowers. For the time being, at IBY's lending rate of 11% p.a. (para
3.11), the onlending rate would be 6%. It has also been agreed during
negotiations that the Government would allow IBY a spread of at least 5% p.a.
on other long-term funds made available to it (IBY) during 1985-87 period.
The proposed Government's onlending rate is substantially lower than under
normal IDA policy, which requires an onlending rate to be the equivalent of
the Bank rate, now 9.89% p.a. However, this is justified given that IBY is a
young institution struggling to develop infant industries and still in the
process of building its organization and staffing. As IBY gains experience
and YAR's industrial sector becomes more developed, it should be possible to
set onlending rates at more appropriate levels and, if necessary, to pass on a
part of the increased interest costs to IBY's subborrowers.
4.30     Summary of Financial Measures.  To summarize, the following financial
measures, designed to improve IBY's financial situation, would be taken under
the project:
a)   the Government to provide to IBY a spread of 5% p.a. under the
proposed credit (para 4.29);
b)   the Government to allow IBY a spread of at least 5% p.a. on all
long-term funds made available to it (IBY) during the 1985-87 period
(para 4.29);



- 19 -
c)   IBY to undertake rehabilitation programs for 10 enterprises in
serious difficulties (para 4.24);
d)   IBY to increase, by December 31, 1988, provisions for losses to 8% of
outstanding portfolio and maintain it as long as the arrears exceed
that level (para 4.26);
e)   IBY to take measures for reducing arrears to below 12% by the end of
1985, 8% by the end of 1986 and 5% by the end of 1987 (para 4.26).
E. IBY's Performance Under Credit 1122-YAR
4.31     IDA approved a Credit of SDRs 9.7 million in March, 1981.  While the
effectiveness was delayed by six months until November 1981 for various
reasons beyond IBY's control and the final date of commitment was postponed
from December 31, 1983 to June 30, 1984, IBY's overall performance in the
implementation of this credit has been satisfactory. As of June 1984,
the full credit has been committed. SDRs 5.7 million have so far been
disbursed.
4.32     IDA has so far approved 19 subprojects, with total investment of $30
million. The total employment to be created is 465, with an average cost per
job of $64,000. This is not out of line in YAR where the cost of skilled
labor is very high and the investors prefer automated production processes
(para 2.05). Of the 19 subprojects approved, 39% were for construction
materials production, 35% in food-processing, 16% in metal working and 10% in
the chemicals and plastics subsectors. Of the 19 subprojects, 12 are
operational and seven under construction. Of the operational subprojects,
nine are profitable, with IRR estimated between 30% - 40%; two projects expect
to breakeven this year and one has had to resort to product diversification,
as the originally anticipated sales to the Government did not materialize.
Three subprojects are involved in exports, albeit in a small way, to South
Yemen. Only one of the 12 subprojects in operation suffered a cost overun.
Implementation delays have been moderate: in five subprojects, delays
exceeded three months out of an average construction period of 12 months
estimated at appraisal.
F. Forecast of Operations and Financial Performance
4.33     Operational and financial projections are based on IBY's pipeline,
and mediumrterm plans for 1984-88, taking into account the economic prospects
in the country for the private industrial sector and the expected beneficial
effects of the proposed project identification, preparation and promotion
activity. IBY's approvals are projected to increase at a rate of 13% p.a. in
nominal terms or about 3% in real terms. This is a realistic expectation.

4.34     Resource Requirements.  Repayments on loans made out of its equity
would be sufficient to meet IBY's local currency needs during the 1985-June
30, 1987 period. It is on the foreign currency side that additional resources
are needed. The Kuwait Fund loan is expected to be substantially utilized by
June 30, 1985. This would leave, on a commitment basis, a gap of about $21.0
million in 1985 through June 30, 1987 as shown in the following table.

4.35     IDA has allocated $8.0 million for the project.  Taking into account
the requirement of $1.4 million for institution building and training (para
5.15), the amount available for the line of credit for lending would be $6.6
million. In addition in October, 1984, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has
approved a line of leasing of $10 million equivalent for IBY, with a first
tranche of $5 million. The proposed IDA credit and the IDB line of leasing
would meet about 79% of IBY's commitment requirement during the project
period. Discussions are underway with other donors to mobilize the remaining
required resources.
4.36     Financial Projections.  Projected Balance Sheets, Income Statements
and Sources and Applications of Funds Statements are given in Annexes 9, 10
and 11.
4.37     The projected financial position of IBY is satisfactory.  Total
assets are projected to increase by 15% p.a. reaching YRI 322 million in
1988. The long-term loans and investments portfolio would increase by 16%
p.a. reaching YRI 243 million in 1988. The long-term debt/equity ratio would
increase from 0.6:1 in 1984 to 1.5:1 in 1988. Long-term borrowings would
increase by 31% p.a. reaching YRI 188 million in 1988. The current ratio
would decline from 4.7 in 1984 to 2.5 in 1988. Net income is projected to
increase by 18% p.a. to YR1 6.7 million in 1988. Administrative expenses
would decline from 4.0% of total assets in 1985 to 3.1% in 1988. The
available interest spread would decrease from 4.1% in 1984 to 3.4% in 1985 and
then increase to 3.8% by 1988.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Components
5.01     The principal objective of the project is institutional; namely to
strengthen IBY's capacity to be more responsive to the technical and financial
needs of the private industry in YAR. It would also provide scarce foreign
exchange for investment.
5.02     To support the above objective, the project would consist of three
components:
a)   strengthening IBY's institutional capacity by (i) using consultants
to identify industrial opportunities, to prepare feasibility studies
and to promote these and other projects (para 4.08 ); (ii) using
technical assistance to strengthen IBY's capacity to appraise and
supervise industrial projects, and to assist entrepreneurs during
their implementation (para 4.08 through 4.11); (iii) training of IBY
staff to improve their effectiveness through short-term overseas
on-the-job and formal training courses (para 4.12); and (iv) seeking
measures to improve IBY's financial health and operational efficiency
(para 4.05 through 4.07 and 4.30);
b)   a line of credit to finance a part of IBY's resource requirements
during 1985 through June 30, 1987 (paras 5.05 through 5.12); and
c)   a small pilot component primarily for training of industrial managers
of subprojects through overseas short-term and on-the-job training
courses (para 5.13).
Institution Builaing of IBY
5.03     The institutional and financial measures to be taken under this
project have already been discussed in paras indicated above. The
identification studies would lead to identification of about 40 projects (in
six subsectors) for which short-term consultants would prepare project
profiles in agreed formats. These would be followed by 15 feasibility
studies. The identification studies would require 24 man-months (MM), or 4 MM
per subsector. Feasibility studies would require 60 MM or four MM per study.
The long-term promotion advisor for IBY has been budgeted for 24 MM. Training
for IBY staff would require 25 MM.
5.04     The procedure for retaining consultants and for approval studies is
described in paras 5.22-5.28.



- 23 -
Line of Credit - Main Features
5.05     Purpose_  The line of credit is expected to finance up to ten
subprojects. As noted above, the main recipient under the credit would be
import substitution and local resource based subprojects. The subloan
proceeds would be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of fixed assets
and permanent working capital. There would be no maximum size for subprojects
but the maximum subloan amount would be according to IBY's Act which would
restrict it to 15X of its equity (i.e. presently about $3 million). To ensure
that the needs of the small and medium industries are properly addressed, at
least 60% of the credit would be used for subloans not exceeding $1 million.
5.06     Interest Rates.  IDA would provide the credit to the Government on
standard terms. IBY's lending rate to subborrowers would be set at 4X below
the local commercial bank lending rate published quarterly by the Central Bank
of Yemen. The Government's onlending rate to IBY under the line of credit
would be set at 5% below IBY's prevailing lending rate. Once committed, the
rates for a subloan would remain unchanged for its life.
5.07     Commitment Charge and Appraisal Fee.  IBY would apply its standard
commitment charge of 1% p.a. and an appraisal fee of 1% of the subloan amount
under the proposed IDA credit.
5.08     Credit and Subloan Maturities.  The IDA credit to the Government
would have the standard maturity term of 50 years including 10 years of
grace. The maturity and grace periods of the onlending from the Government to
IBY would be the average of those corresponding to the subloans provided by
IBY to subborowers under the credit. IBY subloans would have maturities of up
to 15 years including a maximum grace period of three years.
5.09     Free Limit and Aggregate Free Limit.  Taking into account IDA's
experience under Credit 1122-YAR and at the same time to ensure IDA's
continued involvement in subproject review process, the free limit would be
set at $300,000, with an aggregate limit of $4 million. It is expected that
the above arrangement would ensure IDA's review of about 85% of the credit
amount and 60-65% of the number of subprojects.
5.10     rconomic Evaluation of Subprojects.  As under Credit 1122-YAR (para
4.07), IBY would prepare economic evaluation for those subprojects financed by
it where the subloan amount exceeds $300,000. The minimum cut-off ERR would
be 12%.
5.11     The final date for submission of subproject applications to IDA would
be June 30, 1987. The closing date of the credit would be December 31, 1991.
5.12     Procurement for goods to be financed under the credit would be done
in accordance with the normal procedures of IBY described in para 18 of Annex
1 which are satisfactory. These procedures have been reconfirmed during
negotiations.



- 24 -
Training
5.13     The objective of this component is to provide exposure to local
industrial managers in modern management practices. A small pilot component
of 30 MM is provided for this purpose ($1,800 per MM). The training would be
in the form of specific short-term overseas formal and on-the-job training
programs in production, marketing and other functional areas immediately
relevant to operations of the benefitting enterprises. IBY would primarily
use this facility to address the training needs of managers in subprojects
financed by it. Procedures for selecting candidates is given in paras 5.29
and 5.30.
B. Project Costs and Financing
5.14     Project Costs.  The project is estimated to cost about $18.2 million
as follows:

- 25 -
5.15     The institution building component (item (A) in the above table)
involves costs of project identification, preparation and promotion activity
and training. Other institution-building measures such as strengthening of
appraisal and follow-up capacity should be a part of IBY's ordinary activity
and, therefore, not included in the project costs.
5.16     Project Financing.  The proposed IDA credit of $8 million would
finance all of the foreign exchange requirement of the project.  Of this, $6.6
million would be allocated to the line of credit, $1.345 million to
institution-building of IBY and $55,000 to training of industrial managers.
In order to avoid delay in the appointment of consultants for project
identification studies and for promotion tasks, the credit has included a
retroactive financing provision of $300,000. Signing of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and IBY on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit. A
special account of t300,000, to be operated by IBY and representing three
months of disbursements on average, would be opened to facilitate withdrawals
against eligible expenditures.
5.17     Foreign Exchange Risk.  The Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk on the credit allocated to institution building and training
($1.4 million).  Subborrowers would carry the foreign exchange risk on
subloans granted under the Credit ($6.6 million).  IBY would not bear foreign
exchange risk on any other funds made available to it.
5.18     Disbursements of funds would be made to cover:
a)    For Investment Project - 100% of foreign expenditures for goods
and services, 70% of local expenditures for the goods purchased
locally, and 60% of the cost of civil works;
b)    For Consultants' Seriices and Training - 100% of foreign
expenditures; and
With the exception of the cost of small contracts costing the equivalent of
$10,000 or less, all disbursements would be fully documented. Withdrawal
against contracts costing the equivalent of $10,000 or less would be made
against statements of expenditures, the documentation for which would be
maintained by IBY and made available for review by IDA during the course of
supervision. No withdrawals would be made on account of expenditures made in
respect of a subloan more than 120 days prior to the date on which IDA would
have received the application and information required. The estimated
disbursement schedule of the Credit is given in Annex 12.
5.19     Financing of Project Identification, Preparation and Promotion.  The
financing plan for this component has been based on two considerations:
First, IBY would only act as a Government agent in carrying out this component
and its cost implications for IBY should be minimal L/. Second, entrepreneurs
1/  IBY's management and other staff would have to devote some of their time
for this component. But such 'agency costs' are expected to be small and,
in any case, would be compensated by additional business that IBY expects
to generate out of this activity.



- 26 -
intending to proceed with feasibility studies should bear a reasonable share
of their costs. To provide sufficient incentive to entrepreneurs to proceed
with feasibility studies and, at the same time, to ensure that such studies
are carried out for genuinely interested entrepreneurs, it would be required
that they pay 50% of the cost of these studies to IBY in advance. In
accordance with these considerations, it has been agreed during negotiations
that:
a)   Government would lend to IBY $300,000 equivalent in Rials for 20
years, including three years grace, at no cost to finance local costs.
b)   The lI)A credit, which would be to Government, would initially finance
the foreign exchange costs (S1.3 million). This amount would be paid
to IBY in Rials, thus protecting it from the foreign exchange risk.
IBY would reimburse the Government for 50% of the cost of feasibility
studies ($350,000) to be charged to entrepreneurs. The Government
would finance through IBY the remaining $950,000, which would cover
the full cost of identification studies ($300,000), 50% of the cost
of feasibility studies ($350,000) and the foreign exchange cost of
promotion ($300,000).
5.20     Financing of Training for IBY Staff and for Industrial Managers.  The
IDA credit would initially finance the training costs which would be in
foreign exchange. IBY would reimnburse to the Government the full cost of
training of its IBY's staff ($45,000) and of industrial mangers ($55,000).  As
regards the industrial managers, IBY would recover 50% of the cost of their
training from sponsoring entrepreneurs in advance; the remaining 50% of the
cost would be borne by IBY.
C. Project Implementation Arrangements
5.21     Reporting Requirements.  IBY would implement the entire project and
would submit to IDA quarterly reports which would include, inter alia, a
summary of operations, progress on utilization of credit, staff position,
annual reports and audits. The Government and IBY would also submit a report
to IDA when the project is completed.
Procedure for Implementation of Project Identification,
Preparation and Promotion Tasks
5.22     IBY's Role.  IBY's Planning and Research department (PRD) would
actively liaise with the consultants carrying out the identification and
feasibility studies. It would specifically assist in the collection of data,
review with IBY management the progress reports submitted by consultants and
ensure adequate quality of project profiles and feasibility studies.
5.23     Upon completion of the identification studies, PRD wouli identify
potential investors to sponsor the identified projects. It would prepare a
list of prospective investors according to their interest, financial strength,
etc. Particular emphasis would be given on emigrants, traders and existing
clients. PRD would also develop a systematic marketing and contact program
with potential clients.



- 27 -
5.24     Once an investor is firmly committed to the project idea, PRD, where
necessary, would assist him in carrying out a detailed feasibility study. If
an investor does not proceed with the project within six months of the
completion of a study, it would become IBY's property and IBY would be free to
find other investors.
5.25     Approval of Identification Studies.  IBY's Board would approve the
initial short list of project ideas identified by consultants before
developing them (project ideas) iato project profiles. The short listed ideas
would be primarily based on the industrial development strategy considerations
stated in para 2.11 - namely focussing on viable import-substitution projects
which Ci) manufacture products enjoying natural trade barriers, (ii) maximize
domestic value added and (iii) use domestic resources - as well as on IBY's
knowledge of the industrial sector and its consultations with the Ministry of
Industry and other Government agencies. IBY would also review and approve
project profiles prepared by consultants.
5.26     Approval of Feasibility Studies.  IDA would approve all proposals for
studies for which the cost is estimated to be $20,000 and above. IBY would
approve all proposals below $20,000. This would enable IBY to quickly respond
to the feasibility requests for smaller projects. To ensure that the needs of
small and medium industries are addressed, at least 75Z of the proposed
allocation for feasibility studies ($700,000) would be used for eventual
projects estimated to cost below or equal to $3.0 million. The principal
criteria for selecting a project for feasibility study would be that (i) the
project profile (para 5.27) has demonstrated with reasonable certainty the
technical, financial and economic viability, (ii) entrepreneur has been
located to sponsor the feasibilitr study and is prepared to pay in advance 50%
of the expected cost of the study and (iii) the entrepreneur has the technical
and financial capability to quickly implement the project once the feasibility
study has demonstrated the project's viability.
5.27     Recruitment of Consultants.  IBY would recruit consultants for
identification studies, and all feasibility studies costing $20,000 or more
and the advisor for promotion in accordance with IDA Guidelines on the
reruitment of consultants. The consultants for identification studies and the
promotion advisor would be recruited prior to effectiveness with IDA's prior
approval. To expedite studies costing less than $20,000, IBY would invite
offers from at least three recognized consultants and, as in para 5.26,
appoint the most suitable consultant, without IDA's prior approval.
5.28     Payment Arrangements.  IBY would process all withdrawal requests to
IDA, duly supported by normal documentary evidence. IDA would debit the
credit allocation for this component by the amounts disbursed. Further, as
noted in para 5.19 (b), IBY would receive from entrepreneurs their 50X
contribution in local currency in advance at the time of signature of contract
for the feasibility studies between the two of them. When IBY submits
withdrawal applications to the Government, it would reimburse to the
Government the equivalent of 50% of the withdrawal claims.



- 28 -
Procedure for Training Courses and Candidates
5.29     For IBY staff, 5 out of 7 candidates have been identified (para
4.12). IBY would provide to IDA the names of the two remaining candidates
before June 30, 1986. Training programs would be acceptable to IDA, which
would assist IBY in the identification of appropriate places. For industrial
managers, entreprises would identify candidates and training places ir,
consultation with IBY. IBY would ensure that the selected training programs
would be of immediate relevance to the activities of enterprises to improve
their efficiency of operations and that candidates (Yemeni nationals) have
appropriate qualifications. IBY would inform IDA the names of candidates and
training places, duration of training and estimated itemized costs prior to
the start of training.
5.30     Payment Arrangements for Training Expenses.  As noted in para 5.20
when IBY submits a withdrawal application for training, it would reimburse to
the Government the full equivalent of the withdrawal amount. For industrial
managers, IBY would receive from sponsoring enterprises 50% of expected cost
of training in advance at the time of signature of contract between the two.
D. Project Benefits and Risks
5.31     The principal project benefit is that it would make a lasting impact
on IBY's institutional capability to play a more effective development role in
the industrial sector. The project identification, preparation and promotion
activity would generate and lead to financing of viable industrial projects,
which would benefit not only IBY but YAR in general. It would harness an
untapped market of potential entrepreneurs and their resources for investment
in industry. It would also strengthen IBY's pipeline and, thus, mean more
business for IBY. Improved follow-up would enable IBY to understand the
problems of entrepreneurs at an early stage so that timely corrective actions
could be initiated. These and other institutional and financial measures, and
training under the project would make IBY a stronger institution in terms of
staffing and financial health.
5.32     The project carries acceptable business risks, normal for an
operation of this kind. The technical assistance and training would enable
IBY to integrate within its organization the functions of project promotion
and follow-up. Also, the risk that IBY may not be able to find entrepreneurs
for some of the projects identified is being minimized by phasing identifi-
cation and feasibility studies, by requiring IBY to fully scrutinize technical
and financial capability of sponsoring entrepreneurs to implement eventual
projects and by obtaining financial commitment of entrepreneurs prior to
feasibility studies.

VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During negotiations, agreements have been reached  with the
Government and IBY on making a credit of $8 million to finance (i) an
institution building component for IBY through project identification,
preparation and promotion and IBY's training activities ($1.345 million), (ii)
a line of credit ($6.6 million) and (iii) a pilot component for training of
industrial managers ($55,000). The Government would finance through IBY
$950,000 of the credit for project identification, preparation and promotion
tasks as its contribution to YAR's industrial development. Essential to the
project but not financed by the credit, are the advisory services: the
Government and IBY would ensure that not less than the present level of
advisory services would be maintained (para 4.11). Agreements have also been
reached during negotiations on the following main points.
a.   Changes in Policy Statement.  Consultation with IDA prior to any
changes in its By-laws of 1977 and Policy Statement of 1980 (para
4.07).
b.   Recruitment of Local Personnel.  Recruitment by IBY before June 30,
1985 of Ci) one professional in addition to the incumbent Director in
the PRD, (ii) one engineer to bring the number of engineers and
financial analysts in the Projects department to three and five
respectively and (iii) two professionals in the Follow-up department
to bring staffing strength in this department to four professionals
(paras 4.08, 4.09 and 4.10);
C.   Feasibility Studies.  Procedures for identification and feasibility
studies (paras 5.22 through 5.28). Specifically, IDA would approve
all feasibility study proposals estimated to cost $20,000 or above
and IBY would select consultants for them in accordance to IDA
guidelines, with IDA's prior approval (para 5.27). IBY would approve
all such proposals estimated to cos; less than $20,000, invite offers
for each proposal from at least three recognized consultants and
select the most suitable consultant. At least 75% of the credit
amount allocated for feasibility studies ($700,000) would be used for
projects whose costs are less than or equal to $3 million (para
5.26); IBY would require the sponsor of a feasibility study to pay
50% of the cost of the study and would transfer the amount so paid
promptly to the Government (paras 5.16 and 5.28).
d.   Follow-up and Arrears.  Program to strengthen IBY's follow-up and to
rehabilitate 10 enterprises in serious arrears (paras 4.09 and 4.24);
e.   Provisions for losses.  Increase by IBY in the level of provisions
for losses, by December 31, 1988, to 8% of the outstanding portfolio
and its maintenance as long as the arrears exceed that level



- 30 -
(para 4.26). IBY would undertake measures to reduce arrears over
three months to below 12% of the outstanding principal by the end of
1985, 8% by the end of 1986 and 5% by the end of 1987 (para 4.26).
f.   Training.  IBY to undertake a training program for its staff and
industrial managers as described in paras 4.12, 5.14, 5.20, 5.29 and
5.30 respectively.
g.   Interest Rates.  IBY's lending rate to subborrowers to be 4% below
the local commercial bank rate published quarterly by the Central
Bank of Yemen (para 5.06). The Government's onlending rate to IBY
to be 5% below IBY's lending rate. Once a subloan is committed, the
rates would remain unchanged during its life.   The Goverment would
allow IBY a spread of at least 5% p.a. on all long-term funds made
available to it (IBY) during 1985-87 period (para 4.29). IBY's
lending rate and the differential between the local commercial rate
and IBY's rate (currently 4% p.a.) would be reviewed annually, the
first review to be held in December, 1985 (para 3.12).
h.   Line of Credit and Subloan Features to include Ci) use of at least
60% of the line of credit for subloans not exceeding $1 million (para
5.05), (ii) free limit of $300,000 and aggregate free limit of $4
million (para 5.09), (iii) economic evaluation, calculation of ERR
and minimum cut off rate of 12% p.a. for all subprojects financed by
IBY with subloans exceeding $300,000, (para 5.10), (iv) subloan
maturities of up to 15 years including a maximum grace period of
three years and (v) no withdrawal on account of expenditures to be
made in respect of a subloan more than 120 days prior to the date on
which IDA would have received the application and information
required (para 5.18).
i.   Foreign Exchange Risk.  The final subborrowers to bear the foreign
exchange risk on the line of credit ($6.6 million) (para 5.18). The
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk on the credit
allocated for project identification, preparation and promotion tasks
and for training of IBY staff and industrial managers (para 5.17).
j.   Retroactive Financing.  The project to include retroactive financing
of $300,000 to finance the cost of consultants for identification
studies and for promotion prior to effectiveness (para 5.16).
6.02     Conditions of Effectiveness
a.   Enactment of the amendments to IBY's Act (para 4.05).
b.   Appointment by IBY of consultant for project identification studies
and advisor for promotion tasks (a consulting company and an
individual respectively) (para 4.08).
c.   Conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and
IBY satisfactory to IDA (para 5.16).

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)
SECOND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
IB'- s Institutional Structure, Performance & Evaluation
1.       Legal Framework.  IBY's legal framework is essentially the same as
described in Staff Appraisal Report (No 3211 of February 17, 1981) for the
First Industrial Development Project. IBY was incorporated by Act No 55 of
1976 as an autonomous institution to promote and assist the establishment of
industrial projects in private, public and mixed sectors. The Act and By-laws
of 1977 set out IBY's detailed objectives, powers, capital structure,
operational provisions, organization and Board and management functions. The
Act and By-laws are available in Project File. These are satisfactory but
certain modifications are to be made to improve IBY's effectiveness
(para 4.05 ).
2.       Ownership.  The Government holds 70% of the authorized share capital
of YRls 100 million as ordinary shares.  The balance, which is reserved for
the private sector as preference shares, are held as follows: The German
investment Company (DEG) 6%, YBRD 5% and over 2,000 enterprises and
individuals 11.7%. The remaining 7.3% are unsold; IBY is negotiating with the
Arab Industrial Company the sale of the unsold preference shares. The
Government has not anticipated any returns on its equity investment in IBY,
which is seen as a support to industry. But since its inception, IBY has paid
dividends of between 7 and 8% per annum on the preference shares, the minimum
required being 6% per annum.
3.       Assembly Board of Directors and Senior Management.  The General
Assembly meets once every year to review overall operations, pass annual
accounts and declare dividends. The Board of Directors consists of 7 members,
including the Chairman of the Board who is also IBY's Chief Executive
(Managing Director), appointed by a Presidential decree upon recommendation of
the Minister for MEI. Four Board members are ex-officio representatives of
the concerned Government agencies, Central Planning Organization (CPO),
Ministry of Finance (MF), Ministry of Economy and Industry (MEI) and Central
Bank of Yemen (CBY). Two members represent the preference shareholders. In
1981, IBY appointed a General Manager to cope with its increasing activities.
4.       IBY's Board is active, scrutinizing all significant matters in
considerable depth. Specifically, it sets policy and internal regulations for
IBY. It also approves loans exceeding YRI 400,000 and all borrowings. Yet,
in general, the Board needs a more development orienCed outlook, as against
the traditional conservative banking approach to lending.



- 32 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2
5.            Policies and Activities.  In 1980, IBY adopted a Policy
Statement, drafted with IDA's assistance, defining its role in industrial
development, prescribing the project selection and financing criteria and
spelling out banking limits and minimum economic rate of return for
subprojects. The policy statement is available in Project File. The overall
statement is satisfactory.
6.            As regards the activities, IBY is primarily a financial
intermediary extending medium and long-term loans and making some guarantees
and taking some equity in subprojects. It also provides some technical
assistance for subprojects through consultants and its own staff and
undertakes economic and technical research as related to its operations. The
technical assistance role is to be expanded through the strengthening of the
project identification preparation and promotion activities and follow-up
under the proposed project (paras 4.08 and 4.09).
7.            Organization.  The Senior Management team, consisting of the
Chairman and the General Manager, is stable and competent. The Chairman has
largely delegated the day to day management to the General Manager.
8.            IBY has two standing committees.  The Management Committee
reviews all policy and personnel matters. The Projects Committee (formerly
called the Loan Committee) reviews all operational matters related to
subproject preparation, appraisal and supervisLon. The Projects Committee
also approves subloans between YR1 40,000 and 250,000 (subloans below YRI
40,000 can be approved by the Chairman alone).
9.            IBY has six departments organized along functional lines:  The
Projects, Follow-up, Finance department for financial and accounting function,
Administration department for personnel and office upkeep, Legal department
and Planning and Research department to be responsible investment promotion.
All six departments are headed by directors. IBY has recently opened an
office in Taiz to promote business and to follow up on subprojects in that
area. The overall organizational structure is satisfactory. The primary
responsibility of the Planning and Research department would be to identify,
prepare and promote projects (para 4.07).
10.           Staff and Advisors.  Excluding the Chairman, General Manager and
Deputy General Manager, IBY's total staff is 56. This includes 19 graduate
professionals, 22 diploma/secondary school level and 15 supporting. Despite
pervasive shortage of skills in YAR, IBY has maintained a reasonably permanent
cadre of Yemeni professionals. IBY's salary levels compare favorably with
other public and semi-public institutions and may partly explain low
turnover. Though well educated, most professional staff are relatively



- 33 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3
young and inexperienced, which compels a heavy reliance on advisory services.
Also, although the staff is adequate for the present level of activities,
substantial strengthening would be needed in number and quality to cope up
with future responsibilities. IBY, with IDA's assistance, has prepared a
recruitment and training program (para 4.12). This is adequate to carry out
future intended tasks. IBY's existing and proposed professional staff is as
follows.

TOTAL        19                          23
11  The Deputy General Manager is the only professional in the Administration.
The rest are diplomas/school leavers and support staff.
12.      At present, IBY has four expatriate advisors on fixed term; an
economic advisor in the Economic Section of the Projects department financed
by the Kuwait fund, a tachnical advisor in the Technical section of that
department financed by the German GTZ, a financial advisor in the Finance and
Accounting department financed by the British ODA, and an advisor recently
shifted on full-time in the Follow-up Department also financed by ODA. The
advisors are performing satisfactorily. Their current contracts expire within
12 to 18 months. While the long-term goal is to reduce the dependance on
expatriate advisors, during the period of the proposed project (1985-87), IBY
will need and has agreed to continue present level of advisory services (para
4.11).
13.      IBY also plans to recruit an advisor its Research and Planning
department to strengthen its project promotion capability (para 4.08).
14.      Appraisal.  IBY's appraisal staff usually collects relevant data and
information for small projects as the original loan applications are generally
very sketchy. Loan applications for larger projects are normally submitted to
IBY together with feasibility studies prepared by consultants. The technical
section of the Projects department reviews projects feasibility and, if
necessary, recommends to sponsors desirable modifications in project design.



- 34 -
ANNEX I
Page 4
Once agreement is reached on basic project features including production
method, capacity, and machinery specifications, the projects's financial
evaluation is done by the Economic Section of the Projects department. The
financial appraisal normally require entrepreneurs to obtain quotations for
civil works and major equipment.
15.      IBY's appraisal procedures have gradually evolved to a satisfactory
level, although market evaluation is sometimes rather general due to lack of
secondary data. This aspect can be improved by more in-depth studies such as
the identification and feasibility studies financed under the project and by
reaching primary sources in appropriate cases. The methodology being used for
economic evaluation, which was introduced under the first project (Credit
1122-YAR), is working satisfactorily.
16.      Approval and Commitment.  Once appraised, subproject appraisal
reports and subloan documents are submitted to Projects Committee for review
and transmittal to the Board for approval. A subloan is considered committed
when signed. IBY normally requires that civil works is contracted before
subloan commitments, which may explain the high commitment to disbursement
ratio for IY as a whole.
17.      Follow-up.  Follow-up has been weak and ad hoc due to several
reasons, including inadequate emphasis by management, inability of staff to
design and operate a follow-up system. There is also the problem of obtaining
proper data. IBY management now fully recognizes the need to improve
follow-np and has adopted a comprehensive but simple system designed with
IDA's assistance (Annex 6). The formats to collect data are available in
Project File.
18.      Procurement and Disbursement.  As IBY finances small and medium size
projects, individual contracts for the procurement of machinery and equipment
under subloans are not normally large enough to justify international
competitive bidding. As for similar DFC operations, except for very small
items which are purchased off-the-shelf, procurement would involve
international shopping. IBY normally requires at least three quotations from
different machinery suppliers. The Projects department of IBY often assists
borrowers in the selection and purchase of the required machinery. [BY is
thus in a position to ensure that the procurement of goods is done
efficiently, and at economical prices. These procedures have been reconfirmed
during negotiations (para 5.12).
19.      Disbursements are done against satisfactory evidence of expenditures
mostly through letters of credit for the imported machinery and equipment.
Disbursement procedures are well monitored and satisfactory.

Functions and Responsibilities of the
Planning and Reeearch Department (PRD) to Undertake
Industrial Promotion Activities
Introduction
1.       The following sequence of activities typifies the industrial project
cycle:
a.  Preinvestment
b. Appraisal by financing institutions and loan approval
c. Implementation
d. Operations
2.       Industrial promotion involves assistance to entrepreneurs at the
preinvestment stage. In YAR's context, it would include:
a)  identification of investment opportunities,
b) assistance to project preparation (feasibility studies),
c) promotion of entrepreneurship through technical counselling to
them at the project planning stage.
3.       The Government of YAR has decided that, as its agency for industrial
development, IBY would systematically undertake industrial promotion tasks as
a permanent feature of its (IBY's) development activities. IBY has decided to
make industrial promotion as the primary function of its Planning and Research
department (PRD).
4.       PRD would initially have a director reporting to the General Manager
of IBY and one junior professional staff. To rapidly build up PRD's capacity
in industrial promotion, 1BY, at the direction of the Government of YAR, has
decided to (i) subcontract project identification and feasibility studies to
short-term consultants and (ii) appoint an advisor under contract for two
years. The director of PRD would be the advisor's counterpart.
Objectives, Functions and Responsibilities
5.       The main objective of the Planning and Research Department (PRD)
would be to steer potential entrepreneurs during preinvestment stage of
industrial projects from identification of investment opportunities through
their development into investment projects. A secondary objective would be to
generate additional business for IBY.

-    develop publicity campaigns for marketing of IBY's
assistance programs,
-    prepare list of potential entrepreneurs from among the
existing subborrowers of IBY, existing industrialists i-
YAR at large, emigrants and others,
-    classify them according to their financial technical
capability and subsector of potential interest,
-    develop a program of systematic contacts with entrepreneurs
with a view to 'market' project profiles developed through
identification studies (para 6) as well as to sense their
own project ideas,
-    Counsel and assist entrepreneurs, when sollicited, on the
Government formalities and technological, management,
financial and locational matters.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)
SECOND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Project Identification Studies
1.       The Industrial Bank of Yemen (IBY) is a specialized institution of
the Government of Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) under the Ministry of Economy and
Industry (MED) to promote and finance industrial development in the country.
To accelerate the exploitation of the country's industrial potential, IBY
intends to initiate a systematic program to identify industrial projects, to
promote (market) them among potential local and foreign entrepreneurs and to
prepare feasibility studies for the identified projects where justified and
for which sponsoring entrepreneurs have been located. Subsequently, viable
projects could be financed by IBY singly or in coordination with other local
and foreign financial institutions. The above activities form part of Second
Industrial Development Project for which the Government of YAR has requested a
credit from the International Development Association.
2.       To carry out the projects identification studies described in para 1
above, IBY would appoint, one or more consulting firms (called consultants
hereafter) with appropriate qualifications and experience. Consultants are
planned to be appointed by January 1, 1985 and the identification studies are
to be completed seven months later by July 31, 1985.
Projet Identification Studies
3.       The following paragraphs describe in detail the suggested steps in
the carrying out of the project identification studies (preparation of project
profiles),
a)   The priority subsectors selected by the Government of YAR and
IBY for the purpose of identifying investment opportunities are
as follows: (i) food processing, (ii) construction materials,
(iii) light and household chemicals and plastics, (iv) light
engineering, (v) wood working and (vi) service industries for
mechanical and electrical repairs.
b)   Within each of the above subsectors, consultants would as the
first step study all available data and list as many potential
investment opportunities as possible for new projects. Such
investment opportunities are expected to exist in
import-substitution, domestic resource based, export and other
industries, in that order. The list should be submitted to IBY
within 45 days of consultants arrival in the field.



- 39 -
ANNEX 3
Page 2
c)   Consultants with the agreement of IBY would then prepare a short
list of at least 40 investment opportunities with appropriate
justification for further investigation. Priority should be
given to bankable medium-size projects (between $1-3 million).
The short list should fully take into account the work carried
out or being carried out in YAR, so as to avoid duplication.
d)   After the finalization of the short list, the consultants would
proceed to prepare project profiles (4 to 5 pages) for each of
the short listed investment opportunities. The format for
project profiles should be agreed with IBY in advance but, in
any case should include brief notes on the market, project
capacity, main products, process description, machinery and
space needed, project investment costs, income statement,
personnel requirement including foreign technical skills, raw
material requirements including imports, projected range of
financial and economic rates of return and a list of critical
areas which need further investigation in feasibility studies.
e)   About 40 project profiles are expected to be prepared in the six
subsectors listed in para 3a above.
f)   The profiles would be submitted to IBY in 10 copies in English
six months after the starting date.
g)   After review and comment by IBY, the consultant would finalize
the profiles and submit 30 copies in English to IBY.
h)   The profiles would be deemed as completed when finally accepted
by IBY, all outstanding points have been clarified and 30 copies
of the final profiles submitted to IBY.

ANNEX 4
YENEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)
SECOND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for the Advisor in IBY For Two Years
for Project Promotion
1        The Promotion advisor would assist the establishment of
industrial project promotion capability in the Planning and Research
Department (PRD) of the Industrial Bank of Yemen (IBY). The advisor
would report to the General Manager. The director of the PRD would be
his counterpart and training of the director and of PRD's other staff
would be an integral part of his terms of reference.
2.       Within three months of his arrival, the advisor would be
expected to get an overview of the industrial sector in YAR, its
constraints and prospects, the Government's plan for the sector and IBY's
role and operations. During this period, he would also prepare for IBY
management's approval (i) detailed action program for priority areas of
work, (ii) operating procedures for the department, including for work
planning, for performance reporting and review, (iii) quantitative work
targets for six months. Thereafter, he would develop new targets on a
six monthly basis for the management approval on the basis of the
experience of previous six months. For reporting performance, he would
develop formats to be filled out by PRD.
3.       As regards the work priorities, these are expected in three
areas: (i) supervision of and support to consultants carrying out
project identification and feasibility studies, (ii) promotion of
entrepreneurship and (iii) development of information sources. Details
of the tasks involved in these areas are given in para 6, 7 and 8 of the
Functions and Responsibilities of the PRD (Annex 2). Together with his
counterpart as under study, the advisor would have the primary
responsibility in carrying out these tasks.
4.       The advisor would be retained by IBY for 24 months.  He would
have an advanced degree in finance, business, economics or engineering.
He should have experience in managing industrial sector, subsector and
feasibility studies and in entrepreneurship promotion. Experience in a
development bank would be of particular advantage. Knowledge of Arabic
and experience in training would be desirable but not essential.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC (YAR)
SECOND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Functions and Responsibilities of the
Follow-Up Department, Procedures for Strengthening
Follow-Up and the Department's Initial Work Program
1.       Follow-up activity involves assistance to entrepreneurs during
implementation and operation of industrial suhprojects. It would begin after
the approval of a subproject by IBY's Board and end after the subloan for that
project has been fully repaid.
2.       To strengthen its follow-up activities, IBY has established a
Follow-up department reporting to the General Manager. The department would
initially have four local staff, including head of the department, and an
advisor. The department head would be the advisor's counterpart.
Objectives
3.       The objectives of the department are two fold (i) to develop timely
information and recommendations during implementation and operation of
subprojects in IBY's portfolio to overcome problems as they develop and (ii)
to provide information (feedback) to allow better project preparation and
appraisal in future.
Scope of Follow-up Activities
4.       The scope of follow-up is determined by the general objectives
described para 3 above. The follow-up activities are a means for enhancing
the partnership between subborrowers and IBY to achieve subproject goals. The
activities should cover not only supervision of physical works but also all
other areas which are necesary for success of a subproject, including
organization, management, technical aspects, finance and marketing. The
approach is not to blame those responsible for failures but to anticipate
problems and to seek prompt measures to resolve them.
5.       While the responsibility of the Follow-up department would extend to
all subprojects in IBY's portfolio, particular attention would be initially
given to subprojects which are in serious difficulty (para 19 b).
Functions and Responsibilities
6.       The functions and responsibilities of the Follow-up department are:
- to periodically review subprojects in IBY's portfolio,



- 43 -
ANNEX 6
Page 2
-   to ensure that subprojects are being implemented in ac:ordance
with descriptions in their appraisal reports, including
compliance with subloan conditions and IBY's procurement
procedures,
-   to report status of subprojects to IBY management, identify key
problems, make recommendations and to obtain management decisions,
-   to convey to subborrowers, decisions of the IE  management.
Procedures
7.       Organization of Information.  IBY has decided to centralize its
filing system in the Administrative department. The subproject files would be
identified by subproject numbers and would receive all correspondence in
chronological order; including during appraisal and follow-up. The Follow-up
department would also prepare a list of all projects under supervision, with a
summary of important information, including name and address of subborrower,
project cost and subloan amount, date of subloan approval, status
(implementation or operation), and problem rating (para 8). The list would be
updated every three months. The format has been agreed (Form I in Project
File).
8.       Follow-up Planning.  The key to follow-up planning is the problem
rating system which IBY has already introduced. IBY has classified its
projects under follow up in four problem rating categories summarized in the
following table.  The average frequency of visits is indicated.
Projects        With Major                With Minor
Problems                 Problems
Under            Rating:     A            Rating:    B
Construction    Frequency:  2 months    Frequency: 3 months
of visits:               of visits
Under           Rating:      C            Rating:    D
Operation        Frequency                Frequency: 12 months
of Visits:  3 months    of visits
9.       The Follow-up department would plan its activities by preparing work
programs every six months. The planning statement (Form 2 in Project File)
would identify subprojects to be visited, dates on which visits are to be made
and persons to visit. Normally, a team consisting of an engineer from the
Projects department and a follow up officer would visit subprojects.
Frequency of visits is indicated in para 8. However, follow-up would vary in
intensity, composition of supervision teams, and frequency depending upon the
needs of individuals subprojects. The follow-up planning statement would be
submitted to IBY's General Manager for approval in advance of the planning
period.

ANNEX 6

10.      Field Review.  During field visits, the follow-up teams would collect
data summarizing status of subprojects. The format for collecting data, which
have been designed (Forms 3 and 4 in Project File) and essentially compare
progress of subprojects as against their appraisal reports. During
construction stage (Form 3), particular attention would be paid to planned
versus actual implementation schedules for equipment procurement and physical
works, project costs, recruitment of technical assistance and local staff,
availability of utilities and project finances. During operations (Form 4),
focus would be on capacity utilization, marketing, and profitability.
11.      IBY would initially prepare the information needed for reporting.
But, it would aim to progressively transfer this task to subborrowers as much
as feasible, with the supervision teams checking the accuracy of information
provided.
12.      During field visits, the follow-up teams would also review with
subborrowers major problems and possible solutions.
13.      Reporting and Management Review.  Follow-up teams would prepare
summary reports (Form 5 in Project File) for IBY's management within one week
after the completion of field visits. The reports would identify key problems
facing subprojects, their current status and recommendations.  The reports
would be reviewed by the General Manager. The Projects Committee, which meets
every month, would review the reports for all projects with major problems and
make decisions on recommendations made by follow-up teams and the General
Manager. The Project Committee may consult the Board through the chairman on
major decisions, such as loan cancellation or recall and undertaking court
proceedings.
14.      All decisions would be promptly communicated to subborrowers.
15.      Summary Report on Implementation.  Once a year, the Follow-up
department would prepare a summary of its performance (as against plans),
major achievements and problems, projects facing moderate/major problems and
most common problems facing subprojects.
16.      Procurement and Disbursement.  The ultimate responsibility for
procurement would rest with subborrowers. Suppliers and contractors are
normally identified at the appraisal stage. But, Follow-up department would
assist subborrowers in procurement.
17.      Follow-up department would review and certify for disbursement by the
Finance department, withdrawal applications submitted by subborrowers, to
ensure that goods and services are in accordance with subloan agreements.
18.      The Follow-up department would collaborate with the Finance
department in preparing withdrawal requests to external financing agencies.

19.      Initial Work Program.
a. Follow-up department would prepare a list of subprojects under
follow-up with summary information (para 7) and Problems Rating
(para 8) by March 1, 1985.
b. The department would prepare a field visit plan for
July-December, 1985 period by June 15, 1984 (para 9).
Thereafter, the Follow-up department would prepare the plan one
month before the beginning of each planning period. In drawing
up the plan, IBY would give priority to subprojects approved
during 1983 and 84 and to ten enterprises in serious difficulty
for which rehabilitation programs have been prepared.
c. IBY would implement the review procedures by December 31, 1985
(para 10 through 13)
d. The department would prepare the first Annual Report for 1985 on
follow up by January 31, 1986 (para 15).
