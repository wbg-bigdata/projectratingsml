A: Project Development Objective
Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The objective of the Private Sector Development - Capacity Building Project (the Project) is to help C6te
d'Ivoire achieve a sustainable growth rate of at least 6 percent p.a. through increased levels of
investments and exports. Specifically, the Project will contribute to: (a) reducing the dependency on
traditional exports and increasing the share of high value added products in the nation's export structure;
(b) attracting foreign investors and promoting domestic investment by foreign direct investment (FDI)
targeting, simplifying investment procedures, reaching Government-donor consensus on best practice
SME support schemes, including management training for SMEs, and providing analytical support to
private/public sector consultation mechanisms; and (c) creating a more secure legal and judicial
environment for new investors and existing businesses. Progress towards these objectives will be
measured and monitored through: (a) the increase in CMte d'Ivoire's non-traditional exports, as well as
product and market diversification; (b) the increase in foreign and domestic investment; and (c) improved
performance indicators and confidence ratings for the judiciary.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the Project
(see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17007-IVC   Date of latest CAS discussion: August 18, 1997
The CAS emphasizes that the Bank will continue to support improvements to the policy and institutional
environment for private enterprise by lending for capacity building in key public and private sector
managed institutions. The Bank will also support the Government's efforts to upgrade the legal and
judicial system which plays a key role in private sector development.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Previous adjustment operations over the 1991-1998 period ( PASCO, PASFI, ERC, ASAC and PSD
Adjustment) and the 1994 CFA Franc devaluation have addressed major obstacles to private sector
development and created a reasonably favorable business environment in G8te d'Ivoire. Furthermore, the
financial sector was restructured during 1991-1993 prior to the devaluation. Government deserves high
marks for having maintained a stable macroeconomic framework through prudent fiscal management and
restrictive monetary policies since the devaluation. It has embarked upon an ambitious structural reform
program: it has eliminated virtually all price controls and non-tariff barriers and has cut import tariffs.
Since 1990, 38 public enterprises have been privatized, including power, telecommunications, railways,
tourism and agro-industries ( palm-oil, rubber, sugar, cotton etc.). The cocoa and coffee sector -- the
backbone of the Ivoirian economy -- has been liberalized to a large extent and significant income
transfers to the rural population are expected. The reforms implemented under the PSD adjustment
operation of 1996 have generally shown positive results: significantly lower transaction costs for Ivoirian
exports and imports, and better shipping services through maritime transport liberalization; streamlined
ports and customs procedures, more transparent procedures for the tax administration; labor legislation
which allows greater flexibility (fixed term contracts, part time work, temporary job agencies etc.), a
reform of the judicial system, transfer of export development activities to a private organization, and
other measures to increase the competitiveness of the economy.



Page 3
The economy has responded well to the reforms. Growth was 2.0 percent in 1994, 7.1 percent in 1995,
6.8 percent in 1996, and about 6 percent in 1997. Investment has recovered significantly. Domestic
investment grew from 4.4 percent of GDP in 1992-93 to 8.5 percent in 1994-1996. Foreign investment,
through not well quantified, appears to have grown at a similar rate. In contrast to most Sub-Saharan
African countries, Cote d'Ivoire has consistently recorded a strong positive trade balance, with exports
representing 40-50 percent of GDP. Exports of goods in 1996 were US$4.2 billion, a real increase of 67
percent over the average of 1991-1993 ( see annex 2-2 on export structure and growth rates).
However, the bulk of the supply response after the devaluation has been in oil and gas, mining,
cocoa/coffee processing and privatization-related investments, whereas exports have benefited greatly
from the recovery in commodity prices. A more pro-active approach is needed to jump-start investments
and exports in non-traditional sectors, to create capacity among small and medium local enterprises, and
to sell Cote d'Ivoire as a good business address to foreign investors.
The Government has articulated its long-term development strategy in the document "C6te d 'Ivoire,
Elephant d 'Afrique ". The strategy takes its inspiration from the success of the Asian tigers and is based
on fast-growing investment and exports. To implement this strategy, the Government has: (a) dismantled
the ineffective Government-run export promotion agency CCIA (under the Private Sector Development
Adjustment Program) and encouraged the creation of an export development organization under majority
private management, Association pour la promotion des exportations de C6te d'lvoire, APEX-CI),
(b) revised the Investment Code, and created a new investment promotion agency (Centre de promotion
des Investissements en Cote d'Ivoire, CEPICI), placed under the direct authority of the Prime Minister
(under the new scheme, investments below a fixed threshold no longer need prior approval); and
(c) implemented a short-term action plan under the Private Sector Development Adjustment program to
address the most obvious shortcomings of the legal and judicial system. Moreover, in conjunction with its
partners in the CFA Franc zone, C6te d'Ivoire has adopted a region-wide reform of the business laws
which became effective in January 1998 ( OHADA reform).
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the Project and strategic choices:
(a) Export promotion. Boosting exports in a rapidly changing global economy requires continuous
improvement and adaptation of the policy environment for exporters, easy access to information, and a
flexible, demand driven assistance scheme at firm-level, to jump-start non traditional exports in an
economy with a long import substitution tradition. The Project addresses these issues through support to a
privately managed organization whose role is to: (i) manage a cost-sharing grant scheme to assist existing
and potential exporters in obtaining export-related professional services from private sector providers;
(ii) improve the export environment through policy advocacy; and (iii) supply exporters with information
services and links to world markets.
(b) Investment promotion and facilitation.
Attracting FDI: C6te d'Ivoire has achieved a satisfactory level of awareness among foreign investors,
through traditional promotion instruments like investment and trade fairs, "roadshows", visits abroad by
high level delegations, including the Prime Minister and the President. While this approach has paid off
in showcasing C6te d'Ivoire's new business environment after the devaluation and the subsequent
implementation of a major reform agenda, a detailed analysis of the nature of new foreign investment in
C6te d'Ivoire shows heavy concentration in oil, gas, mining, and in privatization of existing assets. The



Page 4
new investment promotion agency CEPICI needs to adopt a more focused approach to achieve maximum
return on the promotion effort, in the form of investor targeting (identification, analysis and prioritizing
of the targeted sectors / markets, creation of a marketing plan). Making use of new information
technology will also maximize the impact of promotion efforts.
Investment procedures: CEPICI carries out most of the required steps on behalf of the investor and has
thus considerably shortened the period needed for obtaining approval to benefits under the investment
code and to register companies. Although this approach has been possible because of the small number of
investment applications per year, it will become increasingly difficult with the growing numbers of
applications. Procedures themselves now need to be simplified, and unnecessary reporting requirements
to different government agencies eliminated.
SME promotion: Although FDI is crucial for C6te d'Ivoire to attain its ambitious development objectives,
investment by local SMEs make a greater contribution to employment and should be encouraged in
parallel. Several SME promotion initiatives or projects are under way, sponsored by the Govemment and
donors. Some are overlapping and sustainability is an issue. SME promotion in C6te d'Ivoire would
benefit from an objective assessment of what has worked and what has not, in the country and elsewhere,
and from reaching a consensus on a sustainable strategy. This would also avoid duplication of efforts
among donors. Upgrading of management capacity of SMEs has already been identified as a high impact
activity in support of SME development.
Public/private sector consultative mechanism: Despite recent progress through the CFA Franc
devaluation and the implementation of the economic reform agenda, Cote d'Ivoire must closely monitor
its intemational competitiveness and further improve the business environment. The public / private
sector consultation mechanism has an important role to play in this process and needs to be reinforced.
National Councilfor Fight against Economic Fraud: Unfair competition from economic fraud (imports
which do not pay customs duties, gross under-reporting of sales, license taxes, etc.) has been a major
concem for the formal private sector. A joint public / private sector council against economic fraud has
been created to curtail such practices which act as a disincentive to investment and expansion of
businesses in the formal sector.
(c) Strengthening of the legal and judicial system. Despite some progress achieved through the
implementation of the short-term judicial action plan under the PSD program, the judicial environment is
still far from satisfactory. Corruption in the judiciary is considered a major element of uncertainty by
investors and the impact of reforms on the length ofjudicial procedures is not yet felt by the private
sector. Although it is clear that legal and judicial reform is a long-term process, measures initiated under
the short term action plan for the improvement of the justice system need to be monitored and extended,
where necessary, to achieve lasting impact. In the area of legal reform, a major breakthrough was
achieved recently when 16 French-speaking African countries jointly adopted a reform of the business
laws (under the OHADA treaty) and the establishment of a common Supreme Court for commercial
matters. To minimize new uncertainty for businesses resulting from the transition period, rapid
implementation of this reform is a priority for C6te d'lvoire. The Project will not only finance the
implementation of the new business laws, but will also support the operation and promotion of an
arbitration tribunal, to encourage out-of-court settlement of business disputes.

2 Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the Project:
Project objectives are of an institutional nature and are detailed under section B.3 and in annex 1.
3. Benefits and target population:
Export promotion: Expected benefits of the export promotion program include the following:
(a) increase in value and profitability of exports amongst recipient firms (based on empirical evidence,
matching grants are expected to yield an increase of at least ten times the amount of grant support),
(b) increased awareness amongst exporters of the value of expert advisory services; (c) the creation of a
consensus on the importance of export-led growth and on the introduction of policies conducive to it,
through public debates and policy dialogues.
Investment promotion and facilitation, secure judicial environment: Expected benefits include a
higher level of investment and competitiveness, hence growth and employment creation. Although
investors and existing SMEs are the direct target population, the program will benefit the working poor
through substantial employment creation.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period : Three years, October 98 to September 2001
Executing agencies:
Export promotion component: Association pour la Promotion des Exportations de Cite d'lvoire
(APEX-Cl)
Investment promotion component: Centre de Promotion des Investissements en Cite d'Ivoire (CEPICI),



Page 6
SME component: Ministry of Planning and Industrial Development
National Council for Fight Against Economic Fraud: Ministry of Economy and Finance
Legal and Judicial component ( not including arbitration court): Ministry of Justice
Arbitration court: Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie de C6te d'Ivoire (CCI-CI)
(a) APEX-Cl will act as the executing agent for the export promotion program. APEX-Cl was created in
1996 as a private sector, non-profit organization. The operational status of APEX-CI as the executing
agent will be based on a Framework Agreement ("convention") between the Government and the
organization, ensuring its operational independence and accountability. A signed framework agreement,
acceptable to IDA, will be a condition of effectiveness. Program activities will be managed by a director
who has been recruited from the private sector through a competitive and open recruitment process. He
will be supervised by APEX-CI's board, which is composed of 9 representatives of the major business
associations and firms, and three representatives of Government departments. Adoption of an operating
manual by APEX-Cl's Board will be a condition of effectiveness.
(b) The subcomponent relating to investment promotion and facilitation will be managed by CEPICI, a
government agency placed under the responsibility of the Prime Minister's Office. The sub-component
relating to SME activities will be managed by the Ministry of Planning and Industrial Development. The
subcomponents related to the public/private sector consultative mechanism and to the public/private
sector/National Council for Fight against Economic Fraud will be managed by the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, which will also provide the project coordination unit.
(c) The legal and judicial subcomponent will be executed by the Ministry of Justice. The arbitration
subcomponent will be executed by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to which the Arbitration
Court CACI, set up in 1996, is attached. The operational status of CCI-CI as the executing agent will be
based on a Framework Agreement ("convention") between the Government and CCI-CI. A signed
framework , acceptable to IDA will be a condition of disbursement.
The APEX-Cl operating manuel has been agreed upon as part of negotiations. A project implementation
manual will be prepared for the other project subcomponents: investment promotion and facilitation/
SME I public-private sector committees/ legal and judicial reform / arbitration court. Adoption of this
implementation manuel will be a condition of effectiveness.
Procurement, Disbursement, Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements: APEX-Cl will
have primary responsibility for the procurement, disbursement and financial management for all of the
export promotion activities financed by the Credit. The other sub-components will be supervised by the
project coordination unit established within the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This unit will finalize
procurement prepared by the executing agencies and handle disbursement, accounting, financial reporting
and auditing for all subcomponents other than APEX-Cl. The project coordination unit and APEX-Cl
will adopt accounting procedures acceptable to IDA and establish an operational project accounting
system as a condition of effectiveness. The project coordination unit and APEX-Cl will maintain and
operate separate Special Accounts. All project accounts, including the Special Accounts and SOE's will
be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit reports will be submitted to
IDA no later than six months after the closing of the fiscal year in Cote d'Ivoire.
Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements: APEX-Cl will establish a computerized Management
Information System to facilitate monitoring and reporting on its support services to the private sector.
APEX-Cl , CEPICI, the Ministry of Planning and Industrial Development, the Ministry of Economy and



Page 7
Finance, the Ministry of Justice and CCI-CI (on behalf of CACI) will submit semi-annual progress
reports indicating the progress in meeting the program objectives according to specific performance
indicators. Key performance indicators for the export promotion program will be updated annually
through a project implementation planning workshop which will include representatives of all the major
stakeholders. The output of these annual workshops will serve as a basis for monitoring and evaluating
the effectiveness of the program. APEX-Cl will be subject to yearly operational audits including a review
of procedures and impact on client enterprises. Key performance indicators for CEPICI, the Ministry of
Planning and Industrial Development, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Justice and
CACI have been agreed upon and will be monitored by the project supervision team.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
A proposed support to a public sector managed export promotion program was not pursued, because there
would not have been adequate safeguards that such a program would reflect private sector priorities and
be responsive to private businesses' needs. As for the strengthening of the judicial system, an option
would have been to spend additional resources on the improvement of the courts. An action plan has been
enacted under the Private Sector Adjustment program, but the actual results will be felt only gradually.
Moreover, this action plan had only a small impact on the major problem of corruption in the judiciary. In
order to provide immediate relieve to the private private, it was decided to set up an arbitration tribunal as
an alternative to the public justice system.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the Project design:
Export promotion: The Government-private sector policy dialogue on export competitiveness is modeled
upon approaches that have been successful in other African countries (Senegal, Ghana and Madagascar).
The proposed design of the matching grant scheme incorporates lessons from IDA and Bank supported
matching grant schemes elsewhere (Kenya, Mauritius, Senegal and Uganda) which have shown that:
(a) the provision of information and management services should be specialized and tailored to the firm's
or association's needs; (b) recipients should be required to pay a significant portion of the cost in order to
ensure a strong interest on their part in the quality of the service and the usefulness of the
recommendations; and (c) the scheme should be managed through an independent, private sector-based
agency, to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.



Page 9
Investment promotion and facilitation: Past adjustment reforms in CMte d'Ivoire were heavily focused on
creating a sound macro-economic framework and promoting structural reforms as pre-conditions for
private sector development. They have fostered a reasonably favorable business environment, but supply
response has been below expectations. A more pro-active approach to investment promotion and SME
support is expected to contribute to sustainable development and employment creation.
Strengthening of legal and judicial system (implementation of OHADA business law reforms/ arbitration
court ): Bank projects to support legal and judicial reforms in African countries have proved to have long
gestation and implementation periods. The harmonization of business laws in 16 African countries and
the establishment of a common supreme court for commercial matters can be considered as a major
breakthrough and must be implemented rapidly. In parallel, to boost investor confidence, immediate
action is needed, through the setting up of an arbitration court as alternative mechanism for commercial
dispute resolution.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Export promotion : The Government first expressed its commitment to a fundamental reorientation of its
export promotion policy when it abolished the inefficient Government controlled Centre du Commerce
International d'Abidjan (CCIA) in 1996 and encouraged the creation of APEX-Cl as a private sector led
organization to play the lead role in export promotion. The Government has subsequently reconfirmed its
commitment by agreeing to a minimal government representation on APEX-CI's board ( 9 private sector
members, 3 representatives of Government agencies) and drafting a framework agreement which will
formalize Government's financial contribution to the association, while at the same time respecting its
operational independence. Until cost-sharing mechanisms will cover a major part of operating costs, the
Government will contribute 25 percent of APEX-CIs budget, according to the statutes. The Government
has also agreed to transfer to APEX-Cl the Trade Point facility owned by the Ministry of Commerce (set
up as a focal point for trade information, with equipment donated by UNCTAD, but apparently not yet
operational). A working group composed of APEX-CI board members has played a key role in preparing
the program by: (a) overseeing the work of local and international consultants in preparing the legal and
organizational documents for the matching grant scheme; (b) organizing an implementation planning
workshop for stakeholders during which output targets were fornulated for the policy dialogue and the
matching grant scheme; and (c) launching the recruitment process for the program director and making
the final selection for approval by the Government and IDA.
Investment promotion and facilitation of investment procedures : Investment promotion is high on the
Government's agenda, as evidenced by the numerous initiatives of the past years. The Government is
fully committed to the objectives of this component and has designated a high level staff within CEPICI
to coordinate the process.
Strengthening of the legal and judicial system. C6te d'Ivoire has played a major role in the adoption of
the uniform regional business laws ( OHADA) and is well aware of the importance of rapid
implementation to boost investor confidence. In parallel, the Government and the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry fully support the arbitration mechanism as an alternate means of conflict resolution in
commercial matters. An arbitration law was passed in 1992, which makes decisions reached under formal
arbitration schemes legally enforceable. The Government is also committed to support a regional
arbitration law (to be adopted within the OHADA framework in June 1998), which will enable the new
arbitration court CACI to operate under conditions that are similar to those previously created by COte



Page 10
d'lvoire's national Arbitration Law. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry to which CACI is attached
has absorbed most of the operatifig expenses for the start-up period and will continue to support the Court
until it becomes financially viable.
5. Value added of Bank support in this Project:
The Bank has been instrumental in proposing an innovative demand-driven approach to export promotion
which is well adapted to the rapidly changing international environment and the need for flexibility. In
the area of investment promotion and facilitation, Bank support under the Project will allow C6te d'Ivoire
to adopt a new approach of investor targeting versus general promotion, and to take advantage of cutting-
edge information technology to promote the country worldwide. In the area of the implementation of the
new OHADA business laws, the Bank supports other countries in the Region and can take advantage of
synergies and cross-fertilization. With the setting up of the arbitration court, the Bank supports an
extension of the privatization concept to the justice sector with a view to supplement the present lack of
capacity of the public sector justice system, until reform efforts come to fruition.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the Project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic Analysis (supported by Annex 4):
[X] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 6.5million; ERR= 26.8 percent [ Cost Effectiveness Analysis:
The net present value of the project is estimated at about US $ 6.5 million for a 12 percent discount rate,
and its internal economic rate of return is estimated at 26.8 percent. The export promotion component
showed a high rate of 34.9 percent. The pay-back period is estimated at 6.5 years and the NPV is zero
when the ERR is 12 percent. It is also expected that 1,200 jobs will be created in the export sector. The
fiscal impact is estimated at US$ 4.6 million mainly from corporate and personal income taxes

4. Institutional assessment:
a. Executing agencies: All subcomponents will be implemented by the organizations/agencies which
are in charge of normal operations in the respective areas. The export promotion program will be carried
out by APEX-Cl, a private sector institution with a broad-based membership among the nation's
exporters. To manage the program a professional manager has been recruited from the private sector
though a competitive process. He brings extensive international business experience and knowledge of
international standards of quality and competitiveness to the management of the program. Through fact-
finding trips and active interchange with similar matching grant schemes, the director will be exposed to
best practices elsewhere. Recruitment of a project management specialist, a business development officer
and an accountant is under way. Program oversight will be provided by APEX-Cl's board which is
primarily (75 percent) composed of representatives of businesses and business associations. CEPICI and
the SME division of the Ministry of Planning and Industrial Development have qualified staff to carry out
their respective components. In the Ministry of Justice, a special position of OHADA and Judicial
Reform Coordinator has been created and filled during the implementation of the Private Sector



Page 1 1
Adjustment Program. The staff is supported by an OHADA implementation committee. The Arbitration
Court CACI is managed by a Secretary General who will be assisted by staff from the Chamber of
Commerce which has committed to supervise financial management and provide advice on promotional
activities.
b. Project management: The export promotion component which absorbs 68 percent of project
resources will be managed separately, so as not to introduce additional decision layers. However, to
ensure transparency in the selection of beneficiaries and allocation of grants, the management of the
program will follow a detailed operational manual. A draft manual has been prepared and agreed upon
during negotiations. A project coordination unit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance will be in
charge of the procurement, disbursement, and financial management aspects of the other subcomponents.
The same accounting and reporting system will be put in place in APEX-Cl and in the project
coordination unit. A private accounting firm will be hired to design administrative and accounting
procedures and to hire and train the accountants.
5. Social Assessment::
The Project will address both urban and rural poverty issues by supporting investment and the
development of export oriented industrial and agro-industrial enterprises. Increased investment and
exports will result in significant employment creation and thus reduce the roots of poverty.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Export Promotion : Both the policy dialogue and the matching grant fund components of the Project,
although designed as temporary interventions, are expected to have an enduring impact on the policy
environment of exporters and their capacity to compete in export markets. The Trade Information Center,
heavily subsidized at first, is designed to achieve full cost recovery by the end of the Project. Government
contribution to APEX-Cl's operating expenses, significant at first, will decline over the life of the Project
at which time APEX-CI's membership will bear 100 percent of non project-related operating expenses.



Page 12
Investment promotion and facilitation: The Project will help the investment promotion agency CEPICI to
upgrade its activities to take full advantage of available investor targeting methods and cutting-edge
information technologies, and to streamline investment procedures. Project activities are of a temporary
nature, but will lay the basis for long-lasting improvement in investment promotion and facilitation.
Investment promotion activities are not intended to generate direct revenues. By the end of the Project,
CEPICI's normal operating expenses will be covered by the budget of the Prime Minister's Office, as is
the case at present. Upgrading of management capabilities of SMEs will make a more sustainable
contribution than ad hoc support and financing.
Strengthening of the Legal and Judicial System: Recourse to arbitration requires prior inclusion of
arbitration provisions in contracts and has, therefore, a certain gestation period. Moreover, CACI has to
establish its credibility within the domestic and foreign business communities, which might take several
years. It is expected that CACI will cover an increasing share of operating expenses over the life of the
Project, reaching around 75 percent at the end of the 3-year period. Full cost recovery is expected after 5
years of operation. During the transition period after the end of the Project, the Abidjan Chamber of
Commerce is expected to cover the residual operating expenses.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Export promotion: A possible source of controversy could arise from the fact that public funds are being
used for non-reimbursable grants to private businesses. This issue has extensively been discussed with a
broad range of Government representatives and the principle has generally been accepted, provided that
the allocation of funds is carried out in a transparent and efficient basis. Another source of controversy
could be the direct involvement of private business people in the formulation of policy reform proposals.
Several examples (Mauritius, Senegal) demonstrate that this process can contribute to a climate in which
policy reform measures are the result of a broad public private sector consensus rather than an adversarial
relationship. The prior experience of the Competitiveness Committee in C6te d'Ivoire supports the same
conclusions.
Investment promotion and facilitation : no controversial aspects identified.
Arbitration court: It could be argued that available financial resources should be put to use for upgrading
the judicial system and not for creating a private alternative to deficient provision of public services. This
position disregards the fact that even in developed countries with a better functioning judicial system, a
great number of commercial disputes are settled out of court, by arbitration. The country's private sector
development agenda cannot be held hostage to a dysfunctional judicial system, which will probably
require several years to improve.

Annex 2-1
C6te d'Ivoire
Private Sector Development - Capacity Building
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Export promotion:  US$ 15.8 million
(total cost of component)
This component will support a newly created private/public sector association of
exporters, the Association pour la Promotion des Exportations de C6te d 'Ivoire (APEX-
CI), to implement a broad range program of export promotion services. This program
has three main subcomponents:
1.    Matching Grant Scheme
2.     Policy Dialogue
3.    Trade Information Center
(1)    Matching Grant Scheme.     The Project will finance the establishment and
execution of a matching grant scheme. This scheme is designed to channel relatively
small amounts of money directly to private exporters to finance a portion of the cost of
support services, as well as specific testing and packaging equipment for exports. The
objective of this cost-sharing scheme is to accelerate improvements in export
competitiveness by providing entrepreneurs access to as broad a range of expert support
services as possible. It is expected that the scheme will provide partial financing to
exporters and export associations for such activities as feasibility studies, technical
consultancies and training courses, participation in trade fairs, the design and
implementation of export marketing campaigns and visits of strategic buyers. The
scheme is designed to be flexible and demand driven and since the beneficiaries are
required to pay part of the costs, they in turn will demand that the scheme be efficiently
and transparently run and be responsive to their needs. To this end, the operations of the
scheme will be governed by a detailed operating manual. This manual specifies the
eligibility criteria, application procedures and procedures for hiring service providers and
evaluating the services they have provided, as well as the nature of equipment eligible for
financing. The manual also specifies the cost sharing formula which is designed to:
(a) make the scheme particularly attractive for small enterprises; (b) ensure that
entrepreneurs "graduate" over time and accept to bear the cost of expert services that
they need. The amount of the matching grant will be calculated based on the total
cumulative costs of all the support services received by a single beneficiary firm and
partially subsidized by the scheme during the life of the Project, according to the
following formula:

Total Cumulative Cost               Beneficiary                  % Matching
of Support Services (US$)           Contribution                 Grant
Small enterprises ( turnover < US$1.0 m equivalent in local currency)
0      -       8,000                35%                          65%
8,001   -     50,000                50%                          50%
Medium-size enterprises (turnover US$1.0 - 5.Om equivalent in local currency)
0             50,000                50%                          50%
over 50,000                         35%                          65%
The total amount of matching grants per beneficiary firm will be capped at US$50,000.
For medium-size firms, this cap can be exceeded in exceptional cases, but at a lower rate
of subsidy. For associations, the total amount of matching grants will be capped at
$80,000 while the subsidy rate will be fixed at 65%, in order to encourage firms to use
this more cost-efficient instrument of delivery of services.
(2)    Policy Dialogue to improve business environmentfor exporters.   The Project
will finance the organization of a policy dialogue which will bring together key
representatives from the Government and the exporters'community who meet regularly
with a mandate to: (a) identify and analyze regulatory constraints to export development;
(b) develop detailed proposals for policy change; (c) submit these proposals to
Government decision makers; and (d) monitor the adoption and implementation of these
proposals. The Project will enable APEX-Cl to commission experts to conduct
diagnostic studies and to formulate policy options, and to invite practitioners, both
domestic and foreign, to present best practices. This dialogue will act as an advisory
rather than decision-making mechanism and, therefore, will depend on the credibility it
enjoys both within the private and public sector. In order to establish and maintain this
credibility the dialogue process will have to strike a balance between independence and
strong commitment from and access to higher levels of Government. The process is
designed to elicit different perspectives from a broad range of participants, inject a solid
dose of analysis into the process and build joint ownership for the resulting proposals.
APEX-C[ will conduct a continuing public awareness campaign to disseminate its
findings and conclusions on reforms needed in the business environment for the
development of exports.
(3)    Trade Information Center.   In spite of rapid progress in the tele-
communications infrastructure, Ivorian exporters still have little access to the range of
information services currently available worldwide. This subcomponent is designed to
greatly enhance the competitiveness of Ivorian exporters at relatively low cost and will:
(a) provide access to data bases and information services available internationally on
export markets and opportunities; (b) connect Ivorian exporters with potential suppliers
and business partners abroad; (c) assist Ivorian exporters in developing communication
means (web pages etc.) on their products and export capabilities; and (d) develop an
electronic inventory of Ivorian exporters and their capabilities for access by foreign



Page 3 of 7
buyers and suppliers. APEX-CT will provide this service on a retail, fee-for-service
basis. Although the service will have to be subsidized during the start-up period
(historically, similar services did not fully recover costs even in developed countries),
sustainability on a commercial basis can be envisaged at the end ot the Project, due to
the advancement of information technology and falling costs.
Project Component 2 - Investment promotion and facilitation:   US$ 5.2 million
(total cost of component)
This component will enhance the capability of Cote d'Ivoire to attract foreign investors,
while at the same time providing investment facilitation and improving the
competitiveness of local businesses, particularly SMEs. It will have 4 subcomponents:
(1) FDI promotion (investor targeting study, development of websites and promotion
materials, organization of two promotional events using investor targeting methods);
(2) Simplification of investment procedures;
(3) Promotion of small-scale local investment through agreement on an effective SME
support strategy and provision of management training for SMEs;
(4) Analytical support to public/private sector consultation mechanism, including
competitiveness studies. Initial support to a joint public/private sector committee against
economic fraud.
Generally, investment promotion agencies worldwide put their operational programs into
three broad categories: awareness creation, investor facilitation, direct promotion.
C6te d'Ivoire has already successfully implemented a broad based awareness creation
campaign, aimed at building Cote d'Ivoire's image and making it visible as an
investment site, through two widely attended investment conferences in Abidjan ( 1995
and 1997), Ivoirian trade and investment fairs in France and the USA, "roadshows" in
several European countries, promotional visits to Asia, publication of a special
supplement in the Financial Times etc.. Investment has picked up substantially since the
devaluation in 1994, but is still heavily concentrated in oil, gas, mining, privatization and
processing of commodities (transformation of cocoa and coffee). At this junction, C6te
d'Ivoire is ready for a well-targeted, more cost-efficient approach which would maximize
returns on public resources spent on investment promotion.
(1) FDIpromotion
Cote d'Ivoire's investment promotion agency CEPICI (Centre de Promotion des
Investissements en C6te d'Ivoire) is a small, well-staffed organization attached directly
to the Prime Minister's office. In order to develop more sharply focused promotional
campaigns, an investor targeting study to be financed under the Project would lay the
groundwork for future promotion activities. The study would start out from a recently
completed series of sectoral studies, and assess the comparative advantage of the country
relative to worldwide trends, to identify the future sources of growth in the economy.
Most importantly, it would identify the sectors and firms within sectors, worldwide,
which CEPICI should be targeting through industry/trade show participation and direct
investor targeting activities. Once consensus is reached on a focused promotion strategy,
a detailed plan would be prepared, identifying the best means of reaching the targeted
groups of firms, including individual firms in each target sector, and the most



Page 4 of 7
appropriate promotional methods and materials to be used. The overall implementation
plan would offer realistic quantitative targets in terms of numbers of firms in contacts,
visits, negotiations, and investments. The Project would subsequently finance the actual
implementation of two selected promotional events, putting to use the investor targeting
methods. Agreed upon benchmarks would be used to assess a performance based part of
the consultant fee of the firm which will carry out the investor targeting study.
Cote d'Ivoire and CEPICI need to take advantage of modem technology ( attractive
websites in several languages, enhanced promotional materials) to promote the country to
the international business community. Promising initiatives have been started ( e.g. a CD-
ROM promoting the country) but much more needs to be done to achieve a critical mass.
The Project would help finance these activities.
(2) Simplification of investment procedures
Company registration procedures are cumbersome and relatively expensive in Cote
d'Ivoire. The one-stop-window established within CEPICI in 1995 has helped speeding
up the procedures significantly, but at the cost of CEPICI staff expediting the
transmission of documents to various Government departments, acting as a facilitator.
However, with an increasing number of applications, this approach has reached its limits
and simplification of procedures has become absolutely necessary.
The Project would finance a team of two national consultants, a lawyer and a computer
specialist, under the supervision of a CEPICI staff. From the outset and during the
process, CEPICI would engage in consultations with all agencies involved to obtain their
adherence and compliance. The team would analyze existing procedures, identify
information requirements of government agencies involved ( proposing the elimination
of those requirements which are no longer necessary) and conceive a single document
with copies to be dispatched to all agencies involved (liasse unique). The procedures
would also have to be brought in line with the recent revision of company registration
requirements under the regional business law reform OHADA. A test phase would
precede final adoption and publication of the new procedures.
(3) Promotion of small-scale local investment through an effective SME support
strategy
After the clevaluation of the CFA Franc, SME activities have taken off especially in
Abidjan and the secondary cities. However support to entrepreneurs has remained scarce
and mostly inadequate. Several initiatives were taken since 1990 by donors, especially
UNDP, the European Union, ADB, as well as Swiss, Belgian and French bilaterals.
Among the recent initiatives UNDP ( through UNIDO) is developing a promising
scheme, privately managed, to provide support to subcontractors. France financed a study
on financial needs of SMEs.
The Govemnment adopted an SME action plan in January 1997 and created the Institut
National Ivoirien de l'Entreprise (INIE), a publicly managed structure to provide
information and technical assistance services to entrepreneurs. However, donors do not
seem to fully support the Government's action plan which lacks financing. It appears



Page 5 of 7
clearly that the comparative advantage of the World Bank at this stage would be to
promote coordination among donors to develop a coherent SME strategy for the country.
The SME component in the PSD Project would entail the following steps: (a) field
assessment of results of the initiatives and projects financed by various donors since
1990, (b) round table on SME policy with all the stakeholders ( Government, SME
associations, donors) to share the results of the assessment and disseminate best practice
in other countries, (c) design of a coherent medium term strategy with a clear definition
of the actors' roles, of the priorities, of the outputs and the review process.
Best practice in other countries has shown that upgrading the management capacities of
small entrepreneurs has had a significant impact on the creation of SMEs and
sustainability of operations. The project will support this element of the SME plan,
through specifically tailored programs to be delivered by existing management schools
and experts familiar with small business administration.
(d) Improvement of the business environment -
Public/private sector consultation mechanisms and competitiveness studies
Weak flows of information and communication between government and the private
sector result in a climate of uncertainty and mutual suspicion which may negatively
impact the level of private investment, bias private investment towards very short-term
projects and push economic activity into the informal sector. To address these problems,
many countries have adopted a formal or an informal consultative process between
Government and private sector representatives. Cote d'Ivoire was one of the first African
countries to implement this approach. The Competitiveness Committee and subsequently
the technical unit of the Private Sector Development Committee combined the efforts of
the public and private sectors to prepare and implement the far-reaching reforms of the
PASCO ( Competitiveness and Regulatory Reform) and subsequently the Private Sector
Development Adjustment operation.
More recently, these useful fora have been abandoned in favor of the resuscitation of the
public/ private sector liaison committee which dealt originally mostly with fiscal issues
and is chaired by the Minister of Finance. This committee operates in a reactive mode -
often dealing with crisis situations created by a prior unilateral measure of the
Administration - and has no long-term perspective of the economy or capacity to pursue
the reform agenda left unfinished after the completion of the Private Sector Development
Program. The proposed Project would help upgrade the liaison committee to a fully
effective consultative body, by providing resources for analytical support for policy
reform to improve the business environment and the competitiveness of the economy.
Initial support for the start-up period of a joint public / private sector committee against
economic fraud will also be provided.
Project Component 3 - Strengthening of the legal and judicial system
US$ 1.5 million (total cost of component)
Private sector development in general cannot succeed without a legal system based on
predictability and stability. Inability to enforce private contracts or high costs and
unreasonable delays have a negative impact on the economic development of a country.



Page 6 of 7
Legal and judicial reform and the existence of arbitral dispute settlement mechanisms
which help achieve efficient and expedient enforcement of agreements between private
parties are, therefore, intrinsically tied to economic progress.
The component aimed at strengthening the legal and judiciary system proposes to
achieve tlhis objective through 3 subcomponents:
(1) Implementation of the recently adopted OHADA regional business law reform:
C6te d'Ivoire, together with 15 other French-speaking African countries, has adopted a
region-wide comprehensive reform of business laws, including general commercial law,
company law and sureties. A second set of laws on credit and recovery of debts, means
of enforcement, bankruptcy, receivership, and arbitration will be adopted in 1998. These
reforms will ultimately enable C6te d'Ivoire to operate in a framework of modem
business laws, but they need to be implemented rapidly. Implementation involves the
following steps:
* Wide dissemination of the contents of the new business laws, which includes
publication and availability of the texts of the laws and publication of manuals;
* Training of legal practitioners ( magistrates, lawyers, clerks-of-the-court, law
professors etc.) and information of the business community on the contents and impact of
the new laws;
* Harmonization of existing laws with the newly adopted business laws.
The project will provide resources for these implementation activities.
(2) Further improvement of the functioning of the judiciary
The private sector assessment of 1994 emphasized that C6te d'Ivoire suffered not only
from the absence of modem business laws ( the situation has been remedied in the
meantime by the adoption of the OHADA business laws), but even more so from the
inefficient judicial system (long delays, corruption etc.). An action plan was adopted in
1996, undler the private sector adjustment credit. The plan was aimed at reforming
procedures at the office of the clerk-of-court, providing better access to legal information
(through support to the Center for Legal Information which keeps up-to-date information
on legal texts and major case law), re-activation of the general inspectorate ofjudicial
services, and strengthening of the legislative process. The Government is prepared to
continue the reform process through further measures to improve the functioning of the
judiciary and has presented a follow-up plan at the Consultative Group meeting in May
1998 in Abidjan. Close monitoring both of the satisfactory implementation of the 1996-
1997 action plan and of the 1998 follow-up plan is needed to ensure their impact. The
Project would establish performance indicators to measure the degree of satisfaction of
the business community and would provide resources for independent monitoring of the
progress of the legal and judicial reform.

(3) Establishment and operation of an Arbitration Court
Efforts to improve the functioning of the judicial system rarely produce quick results.
Moreover, in most countries, many commercial disputes never reach the courts and are
settled through arbitration. An Ivorian law of 1992 provides the legal framework for
enforcement of arbitration decisions and the Abidjan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry decided in 1995 to set up an arbitration court attached to this institution. The
court opened in early 1997 when a secretary general was recruited. The proposed Project
will assist the Arbitration Court in attracting a number of cases which will enable it, after
a 3 year period, to cover most of its operating expenses. Support will take the form of
technical assistance to establish the credibility of the court with national, regional and
international businesses by providing quality control during the start-up period, assist
with establishing and updating a list of qualified arbitrators, improve its procedures,
publish an Arbitration Guide for Ivorian businesses. The proposed Project will also cover
part of the operating costs of the Arbitration Court during the start-up period and
communication/promotion expenses.

Structure and growth rates of exports of C8te d'Ivoire
Export Structure by products
1.    CMte d'Ivoire's export structure is still very much dominated by unprocessed agricultural
products which made up 49.1 percent of the value of exports in 1997. Timber accounted for 6.7
percent which brings the share of commodities on CMte d'Ivoire's exports to 55.8 percent.
Processed agricultural products like cocoa butter, palmoil, and canned tuna represent another 13.5
percent of exports. The percentage of products based on agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishing
thus amounts to 69.2 percent of total exports in 1997.
2.     Other exports ( i.e. non agricultural, livestock, forestry, and fishing) represent 30.8 percent
of total exports in 1997. Out of this subtotal, petroleum exports ( raw and refined) represent
13 percent, which brings the share of non-agriculture/livestock/forestry/fishery based industrial
exports ( excluding petroleum) to 17.8 percent of total exports. If one includes exports of processed
agriculture/ forestry/fishery products in the category of industrial exports (which would not be
consistent with ISIC), the share of industrial exports in total exports would be 31.3 percent.
3.     The structure of exports has not changed significantly as compared to the level before the
devaluation. However, the share of unprocessed agricultural / livestock / fishing exports has
increased slightly from 45.3 to 48.3 percent due the higher world market prices for the main
commodities cocoa and coffee. The share of processed agricultural products has remained the same
at 13.5 percent. The share of industrial products in a strict sense ( excluding agro-products and
petroleum) has increased from 14.9 percent to 17.7 percent of total exports.
Export growth rates
4.     Exports in local currency have more than tripled between 1993 ( the year before the
devaluation) and 1997, increasing by 231 percent. Even if the mechanical effect of the 50 percent
CFAF devaluation is factored in, this would still represent 1] 5 percent increase over pre-
devaluation levels.
5.     The most significant increase can be seen in the growth rate of "other products" which are
mainly exported to neighboring African countries. The growth rate of 329 percent compared the
level before devaluation ( 1997 / 1993), and 87 percent compared to the year immediately after the
devaluation ( 1997/1994) reflects the increased competitiveness of the products of the Ivoirian
industry compared to traditional competitors from developed countries.
6.     The overall growth rate of exports of agro-products is an impressive 46 percent
(1997/1994) and is mainly due to increased cocoa processing ( + 64 percent over the period).
However, ifor non traditional agro-products the growth rate stands at only 3 percent over the 1994-
1997. This indicates that despite its undeniable comparative advantage in these products and large
world market potential, CMte d'Ivoire has not been able to open up new markets and diversify into
new products.

(a) Using a discount rate of 12%.
(b) Benefits are estimated using incremental taxes obtained from corporate and income taxes of

Main Assumptions:
1. Stable macroeconomics environment as projected in the CAS with real GDP growth averaging
at 6-7% per annum.
2. The export firms will have (a) access to export markets; (b) improved technology for strategic,
functional and technical information; and (b) will have access to information that will facilitate
information interchanges with foreign markets.
3. It has also been assumed that: (a) financial costs and benefits are equated to economic cost and
benefits; (b) average matching grant will be $13,500 for individual firms and $27,000 for
subsector associations; (c) Its assumed that APEX-Cl subsidy rate will be 50%.
4. Its assumed that the output increases by 10 times, and that the social costs of other crucial
resources in the economy that are diverted into the project is 67%. Therefore, the net benefits
have been discounted by this rate. Detailed quantitative assumptions are described in Annex 4-1
Results
Base Case Results. The net present value of the project is estimated at about US $ 6.5 million for
a 12% discount rate, and its internal economic rate of return is estimated at 26.8%. The Export
promotion component showed a high rate of 34.9%. The pay-back period is estimated at 6.5 years
and the NPV is zero when the ERR is 12%. It is also expected that 1,200 jobs will be created in
the export sector.



Switching values of critical items:
Three sensitivity tests were carried out: (a) the first test assumed that the disbursement period is
elongated over a period of 6 years; the NPV was reduced to US$2.7 million and the ERR was
17.3%; (b) the second test assumed a 75% social cost of resources diverted into the project; the
result was NPV of US$2.0 million; (c) the third test was to increase the expected increase in
output for each firm from 10 to 15 as in the East Asian countries and Kenya. The results showed
NPV of US$13.4 million and ERR of 40.5%. These results established the fact that the project is
robust.



Annex 4-2
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
0.1    The economic analysis of this type of private sector development project presents
special difficulties particularly when there is an indirect relationship between the
project's actions and the stream of benefits. The difficulty in measuring benefits lies in
the fact that the project would be supporting an acceleration process leading to an
outcome rather than supporting the direct outcome. Moreover, it is equally difficult to
estimate the amounts and types of exports that would be financed through the matching
grant's scheme to the emerging exporters. Despite these difficulties, an attempt has been
made to present a quantified measure of the benefits that are expected from the project.
Therefore, a brief project description has been given to highlight the intentions of the
project, as to what it hopes to achieve, create or establish in a "with" and "without"
project framework. This is followed by an explanation on how the benefits have been
quantified. A cost-benefit analysis framework has been used to calculate the Net Present
Value (NPV) and Economic Rate of Return (ERR).
0.2    The economic analysis has produced an NPV of US 6.5 million at a discount rate
of 12 percent and an ERR of 26.8 percent. This estimate has been based on a
methodology whereby the project is assumed to accelerate an increase in output by 3
years.' Such an increase in output is therefore expected not to be realized without the
project. Nonetheless, to simplify the analysis the indirect benefits have been excluded,
thus, giving lower results than would have been the case otherwise.

exports in order to achieve a high growth rate of between 6 - 7 percent per annum. This
is necessary for the achievement of sustainable poverty reduction in Cote d'lvoire.
Specific project objectives are to: (a) support growth of export in non-traditional
products; (b) attract foreign investors through investment promotion activities and
simplified investment procedures; (c) create a secure legal environment for investors and
existing businesses. Progress towards accomplishing these objectives will be measured
through: (i) the increased number of non-traditional exporters; (ii) contribution of non-
traditional exports to the nation's GDP; (iii) increases in foreign investment; and (iv)
increases in business confidence ratings of the country. An interesting element in the
design of the project, is that, the private sector is the key player in particular, during
implementation. The private sector through the APEX-CI2, will be committing their own
resources and financing to match the amounts supported by the project by taking risks in
investing in non-traditional export sector activities. This element will allow the discipline
of the export market to operate in an efficient way, and to ensure that, the types and levels
of investments made by the 215 firms assisted under the project will generate sound
economic returns to the country.
0.4   Implementation. The project will support export oriented firms in C6te d'Lvoire to
increase their economic returns on their investments and thus become more profitable.
This would mainly be achieved through a reduction in costs, as outputs are expected to be
sold in competitive markets (for example in import-competing or export markets). This
reduction in costs can also be manifested as, an improvement in productivity, is expected
to be achieved through:
a  Access to Markets - support services for exporters;
*  Improved Technology - through utilization of improved technology for
strategic, functional and technical information;
*  Access to Information - the project will establish an information database that
will facilitate information interchanges between Cote d' Ivoirian exporters and
foreign markets.
Cost-Benefits Analysis
0.5   Ideally, the effect of each of the project interventions on the costs of the firms
should be the starting point for the examination of potential increases in profits. However,
such data is not readily available. Although most firms have an estimate of potential
increases in output that could result from specific actions including project interventions,
such information is not readily available. This is mainly due to the fact that most private
firms will not volunteer such information because of income tax purposes. Thus, this
2APEX-CI is a non governmental organization that is for export organization that is under majority
private sector management.



Page 3 of 7
information has not been used for estimating the potential increases in individual firm
profits (benefits) expected from the project.
0.6   Instead, the output generated from the project supported export oriented firm has
been used as an alternative measure for the benefits. This approach has indicate a very
high valuation of the project's benefits. Some adjustments have thus been done to
accommodate the opportunity cost of the private funds utilized in the project (See par.
1.11). It was therefore judged that the profit numeraire was not ideal for the cost benefit
analysis of investment projects that have matching grant schemes.
Assumptions
0.7   The first underlying assumption is that the financial costs and benefits can be
equated with the economic costs and benefits of the operations of assisted firms. This
assumption has its problems because the financial statement does not always capture
economic externalities associated with environmental resource use. Another source of
divergence is labor, especially if the shadow wage rate is significantly below the market
wage rate. In this case, the financial return understates the economic return, other things
being equal. Nevertheless, with the liberalization of the economy, it is assumed that
prices in the economy reflect the forces of market supply and demand as opposed to
policy distorted price levels. In the absence of precise information on these types of
considerations, it is practical to assume that the financial and economic values are
concurrent. Therefore, the hypothesis applied is that the firms assisted in the project face
largely undistorted prices.
0.8   The second assumption is that APEX-CI will provide matching grants to 200
firms and 15 subsector associations. Thus, the first year 50 individual firms and 5
subsector association will receive the matching grant. In the second year, 75 individual
firms and 5 subsector association and year three, 75 individual firms and 5 subsector
associations will receive matching grants. The average value of matching grant will be
US$ 13,500 for individual firms and US$ 26,000 for subsector associations.
0.9   It is also assumed that the APEX-Cl subsidy rate for individual firms will vary
from 35 to 65 percent depending on the cumulative costs of the interventions already
supported. For the purpose of this analysis, the average subsidy is assumed to be 50% .
For associations, the subsidy rate is fixed at 65 percent. The average total cost of a firm
level intervention is assumed to be 27,000 for individual firms and $40,000 for the
subsector associations.
0.10  The valuation of the benefits uses a two stage calculation which first estimates the
extra output created by assisted firms and second estimates the profit associated with that
output. Ideally, the additional output is defined as the difference between the level of
output achieved by firms assisted by the project and the level of output these same firms
would have achieved in the absence of the project. According to a methodology



Page 4 of 7
developed by Levy, Berry and Nugent3, which is based on empirical evidence in similar
schemes in East Asian countries, it assumed an output increase of about 15 times of the
matching grant amount. Nevertheless, in this analysis, the project's assumptions are very
conservative by expecting the matching grant to accelerate increases in firms output 10
times. The expected increase is further reduced by two-thirds. This reduction in net
benefits is based on an assumption that important resources would be diverted from other
economic activities to facilitate the achievement of project results.
0.11   The matching grant is also expected to inject know-how in companies to stay
competiltive apart from creation of additional jobs. Employment creation has been taken
into account as a secondary effect of the matching grant scheme. Therefore, about 1,200
jobs are expected to be created in the non-traditional export sector by the end of the
project.4
0.12   'Measurement of economic benefits of institutional development support in the
judiciary system and investment promotion is difficult because they furnish provision of
services to firms indirectly. For the sake of consistency, it was assumed that the support
provided would increase efficiency of the supported recipients and would yield an
increase in economic outputs at a multiple of two times the amount of support.

Results
0.13    The above explained analysis yielded a series of accelerated increase in output
levels per component. The same scenarios were then repeated, albeit, staggered three
years behind the first analysis. This was based on the assumption that, the principal result
is the acceleration of the process by three years. As indicated in Table 2. above and Chart
1. below, the final economic results are represented by the present value calculations of
the difference between the first scenario of increases in output resulting from the project
and the same scenario, three years behind it. The results suggest that the overall project
can be strongly justified in NPV and ERR terms. The Export promotion component
showed a high rate of return of 34.9 percent 6. The pay-back period for the investment is
estimated at 6.5 years. The NPV is less than zero when the ERR is around 12 percent.

Sensitivity Analysis
0.14 The sensitivity analysis switched values on the export promotion component and
kept the institutional disbursements as in base case scenario. The first evaluation was
done by elongating the disbursement over a period of 6 years, the effect on the project
6 Similar schemes in Zimbabwe showed an ERR of 46% and that of Zambia's showed 42%. It therefore
means that the scheme is highly profitable.



Page 6 of 7
was that the NPV was reduced from US$ 6.5 million to US$ 2.7 million and the ERR
from 26.8 percent to 17.3 percent . This suggested that a slower implementation period
will not have a material effect on the economic impact of the project.
0.15   The second evaluation was done by modifying the reduction in the level of output
attributed to diversion from other resources. In this case, by increasing the reduction from
67 percent (the base case) to 75 percent, the NPV remained positive at US$ 2.0 million.
In reducing the level of reduction in the level of output to 50 percent, the NPV increased
significantly to US$ 16.0 million with an ERR of 43.8 percent . Thus, although the
outcomes are sensitive to the effects of modifying this variable, all of the outcomes
presented positive NPVs within the parameters (50-78 percent reduction) established in
the theoretical foundation for this approach.
0.16   A third evaluation was done on the base case scenario by switching the expected
increase in output for each firm from 10 to 15 as that of the East Asian countries and
Kenya. The results showed an NPV of US$ 13.4 million and an ERR of 40.5 percent.
Meanwhile, on the other hand, the multiple value can go as low as 6.5 before the NPV
becomes negative.

Additional benefits from the project includes:
*   Improved awareness of economic opportunities that do not directly result in
increases in output and employment by the firms supported.
*   Secondary and tertiary effects of increases in output.
*   Development of know-how within the consultant industry will reduce the
heavy reliance on foreign expertise especially when put to use beyond the
enterprises supported.
*   The reduction on reliance of foreign consultants will help reduce pressure on
balance of payments for payment of fees in foreign currencies.
*   Reduction of costs of doing business in C6te d'Ivoire and business laws will
be enforced at a faster pace.
Main Beneficiaries.
0.18   The main beneficiaries of the project would be about 200 Ivorian firms and 15
subsector associations and consultant industry. The individual beneficiaries would thus be
the principals and employees of the firms affected. More generally, the whole consultant
service industry will benefit as they improve their efficiency for business services. The
fiscal impact is estimated at US$ 4.6 million mainly from corporate and personal income
taxes.

Procurement of goods and services
All goods and services under the IDA Credit shall be procured under contracts awarded in accordance
with Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA Credits, January 1995, revised in January and
August 1996 (Procurement Guidelines). The project is expected to procure mainly vehicles, video /
computer and other office equipments, and materials. Specialized equipment for Part A of the project
will be procured by international shopping. Other goods expected to cost less than $50,000 per contract,
not exceeding an aggregate amount of $1,500,000 for Part A of the Project, and $500,000 for parts B
and C of the Project, will be procured by national shopping, on the basis of at least three eligible
suppliers. IAPSO procurement may also be used for vehicles, computers and other office equipment.
Consultants
Most of the procurement for the project will be in the forn of technical assistance and training.
Consultants contracts shall be awarded in accordance with Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency, January 1997 (Consultant Guidelines).
Contracts for services that meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs 3.8 to 3.11 of the Consultant
guidelines may, where appropriate and with the Association's prior agreement, be procured through
Single Source Selection. Consultant services of a standard or routine nature, mainly audits, estimated to
cost less than $25,000, may be procured under contracts awarded according to the Least Cost Selection
Method.
Consultant recruitment under the APEX-Cl matching grant scheme will follow commercial practices,
on the basis of a detailed operating manual which guarantees transparency without introducing
cumbersome procedures incompatible with a private sector organization. The operating manual contains
guidelines regarding the qualification of consultants and ensures they have no part in the business for
which they serve as consultants. Adoption of this operating manual will be a condition of effectiveness.
Review by the Bank of the selection of consultants
(a) Selection planning for consultancies: The plan for the selection of consultants under the
project ( with the exception of consultants for APEX-Cl, see below) shall be furnished to the
Bank for its review and approval, in accordance with the provision of paragraph I of Appendix I
to the Consultant guidelines. Selections of consultants' services shall be undertaken in
accordance with such selection plan. - However, no selection plan can be drawn up in advance
for the APEX-Cl matching grant scheme which is by nature demand-driven. Beneficiary firms
will determine the need for consultants and submit request which will be screened on the basis
of the guidelines of the operating manual.
(b) Prior Review: With respect to each contract for the employment of consulting firms
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more, the procedures set forth in paragraphs
1, 2 (other than the third subparagraph of paragraph 2(a)) and 5 of Appendix I to the Consultant
Guidelines shall apply. With respect to each contract for the employment of consulting firms
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more, but less than the equivalent of
US$100,000, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 1, 2 (other than the second subparagraph of



Page 3 of 6
paragraph 2(a)) and 5 of Appendix I to the Consultant Guidelines shall apply. All single source
contracts are subject to prior review by the Bank.
With respect to each contract for the employment of individual consultants etimated to cost the
equivalent of $50,000 or more, the qualifications, experience, terms of reference and terms of
employment of the consultants shall be furnished to the Association for its prior review and
approval.
(c) Post review: With respect to each contract not governed by paragraph (b) above, the
procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of Appendix I to the Guidelines shall apply.

Procurement organization
Satisfactoly procurement capacity will be set up in APEX-Cl and the Project Coordination Unit. APEX-
CI will recruit a project manager who will be responsible among other assignments for reviewing terms
of reference for consultants, and a financial mananger who will handle other procurement matters and
ensure compliance with the procurement provisions of the Bank Guidelines, the Project Agreement and
the Operating Manuel (for commercial practices). The head of the Project Coordination Unit will recruit
an assistant who will be in charge of reviewing procurement matters with the executing agencies other
than APEX-Cl and finalizing contracts. Procurement staff from both APEX-Cl and the Project
Coordination Unit will attend a Bank procurement and disbursement seminar before credit
effectiveness.

Project Accounts and Auditing
A private accounting firm will be hired to design accounting and administrative procedures, and to hire and train
the accountants. Project accounts will be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA,
according to international auditing standards; special accounts and all disbursements under SOEs will be audited
semi-annually. The annual audit report will be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each fiscal
year, and the semi-annual audit report within three months of each period.
Government has already paid an amount of CFAF 300 million representing its contribution to APEX-CI for FY
1998 and will be required to deposit the initial amount of the project account (CFAF50 million). The account
will be replenished monthly.
