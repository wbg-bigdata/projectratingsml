APPRAISAL OF FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT - COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Fourth Telecommunications
Project of the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) of Costa Rica,
which has requested Bank assistance in financing the Project; the estimated
total cost of the project is US$54.2 million.*
ii.       Since 1963 the Bank has provided major financial assistance to
telecommunications development in Costa Rica through three loans, totalling
US$33.5 million, to ICE. The first two projects have been completed suc-
cessfully; the third is under construction, with satisfactory progress,
and is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of 1976. ICE's per-
formance under previous telecommunications lending operations has been
sati sfactory.
iii.      ICE is a government-owned autonomous institution responsible for
both telecommunications and electric power development in the country. In
the power sector, it is responsible for all new generating facilities and
for distribution of electricity in some areas of the country. In the tele-
communications sector, it is responsible for all internal and some external
telephone service and will assume responsibility for telegraph, telex and
all international service within the next three years. Its dual nature has
in the past caused some organizational problems, which are currently being
studied by management consultants; these studies are part of the Fourth
Power Project (Loan 800-CR). Before hiring consultants, ICE took steps to
improve its organizational structure, giving more autonomy to each of its
two operating sections. Continuation of this autonomy is provided
in the proposed loan agreements.
iv.       The project includes expansion of:  the telephone network capacity
by 56,300 exchange lines; the long-distance network capacity by 2,500 trunk
circuits; the rural telephone system to serve 90 additional rural communities,
making a total of over 700 communities served by the end of the project period;
telex/gentex service; and ICEts trainir.g facilities.
v.        The proposed loan of US$23.5 million would cover about 76% of the
project's foreign exchange cost. A US$2.3 million loan from the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration and suppliers' financing would cover
the balance of the foreign cost. ICE plans to apply for a 50%overall tele-
phone tariff increase to enable it to pay for 40% (approximately the local
cost component) of its telecommunications expansion program through 1977,
which includes completion of the Third Stage as well as the project. With
the tariff increase effective by the beginning of 1975, the financing plan
would be satisfactory.
*  Including interest during construction of US$3.4 million.



vi.       ICE's telecommunications staff, with assistance from contractors'
engineers as necessary, will plan, engineer and install the equipment
included in the project, as it has done satisfactorily in past telecommunica-
tions projects.
vii.      Procurement of items financed by the Bank would follow the Bank's
guidelines, Extensions to existing installations where direct compati-
bility is essential, whose estimated cost is about US$4 million, would be
purchased directly from suppliers with whom the original contracts were
placed as a result of international competitive bidding under previous Bank
loans. Because of long lead times involved in the manufacture of urgently-
needed equipment, ICE would have to make commitments to purchase goods with
a value of about US$6 million before loan signing, but no retroactive financ-
ing would be required.
viii.     The Project represents the least-cost solution to meeting Costa
Rica's telecommunications needs through 1977. The return on the project
investment is estimated to be at least 21 percent.
ix.       :.CE's National Telecommunicat:ions System's financial position and
earnings h .ve been satisfactory and wil:l remain so, assuming implementation
of the proposed telecommunications tariff increase (paragraph v). ICE's
other section, the National Electric System, has just received tariff in-
creases which would increase overall tariff levels by about 40% . This in-
crease, together with a further electric tariff increase to be implemented
before the end of the year to compensate for effective devaluation of the
colon, is expected to remedy a previously unsatisfactory financial situation.
x.         The Project would form a suitable basis for a loan of US$23.5
million with a term of 20 years including four years of grace. The loan
would be made to ICE and guaranteed by the Republic of Costa Rica.



APPRAISAL OF FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT - COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Fourth Telecommunications Project in
Costa Rica, for which the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE)
has sought Bank assistance.
1.02      The project, which is essentially the first half (1974-77) of
ICE's Stage IV program for expansion of the National Telecommunications
System (NTS) through 1980, is estimated to cost US$54.2 million, including
a foreign exchange component of US$30.8 million. It will expand the na-
tional telephone network through installation of 56,300 exchange lines in
42 existing and new exchanges, 2,500 long distance circuits and trunk
switching equipment; substantially improve rural telegraph/telephone service
and extend this service to areas presently without it; extend the telex/
gentex network; and expand NTS' training capability.
1.03      The proposed Bank loan of US$23.5 million would cover some 76% of the
project's foreign cost and would be made to ICE, a government-owned autonomous
institution. The balance of the project's foreign cost would be financed by
the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and suppliers. The
remaining (local) costs of the project would be financed by NTS' internal cash
generation.
1.=04     The project will be a continuation of schemes carried out under
three previous Bank loans for ICE's telecommunications, listed below:
(in millions of US$)
Loan Number             Year             Loan Amount            Stage
346-CR               1963                  9.5           Stage    I
632-CR               1969                  6.5           Stage   II
801-CR               1972                 17.5           Stage  III
The first two projects have been completed successfully. After re-allocating
about US$3.3 million of the proceeds of Loan 801-CR to meet unforeseen growth
in long-distance traffic, Stage III is progressing on schedule.
1.05      ICE is responsible for electric power as well as telecommunications
in Costa Rica, and all three previous telecommunications loans were made in
conjunctionwith power loans.  Because of the urgent need for expansion of
telecommunications facilities and delays in preparing feasibility studies for
the next power project, it was considered necessary to present the proposed
telecommunications loan for consideration iy the Executive Directors now,
leaving consideration of another power loan to next year. Because project
appraisal for either of ICE's sections necessitates a financial review of the
other section, the appraisal mission reviewed the financial plans and projec-
tions of the power section to the extent possible, although a complete feasi-
bility study of the next power project is not yet available.
1.06      This report is based on a telecommunications feasibility study
provided by ICE and on the findings of an appraisal mission composed of
Messrs. John E. Graves, Nikola R. Holcer, Jorge A. Cavallotti and L. R. Bitran
(Consultant), which visited Costa Rica in November/December, 1973.



2. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Sector Organization
2.01      ICE has been responsible for telephone service in Costa Rica
since 1963. With Bank assistance, ICE has improved the level of telephone
service from unsatisfactory to acceptable; at the end of 1973 Costa Rica
had a telephone density of 2.16 telephones per 100 population, the highest
in Central America (see Annex 1), but demand for service exceeds ICE's
present capability to provide it.
2.02      Public telegraph service is operated by the Ministry of Interior
with obsolete facilities providing poor service to a decreasing number of
customers.  The quality of this service is expected to improve when ICE
assumes responsibility for it, beginning in 1975.
2.03      Most international services are the responsibility of Radiografica
Costarricense S. A. (RACSA) a concessionary company owned 50-50 by ICE and a
Costa Rican individual. In accordance with the statute that established
RACSA in 1964, ICE will take over the company and its services by 1977.
2.o4      ICE, which represents Costa Rica on the Regional Technical Commis-
sion on Telecommunications (COMTELCA) of the five Central American republics,
owns and operates the Costa Rican section or the Central American regional
microwave network, completed in November 19 l.-
Regulation and Tariffs
2.05      The Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE) is Costa Rica's princi-
pal regulatory authority. It has jurisdiction over the tariffs, technical
standards and finances of ICE's electric and telecommunications operations
as well as over all other entities providing public electric and water/
sewerage services. However, SNE does not have jurisdiction over RACSA; this
anomalous situation will terminate with RACSA's demise in 1977. The govern-
ment reviews SNE's decisions concerning tariff matters.
2.06      Annex 2 shows the principal tariffs for telecommunications services
in Costa Rica and includes tariffs proposed by ICE to achieve an overall 25%
increase in revenues (see paragraph 6.14). The proposed increases in instal-
lation fees are needed to meet actual costs of installing new telephones,
which exceed present installation fees. The higher fees are also expected
to dampen demand for new telephone installations.
2.07      ICE's proposed telephone tariffs, even with further increases
necessitated by exchange-rate unification (see paragraph 6.15), are reasonable
in relation to its cost of providing service and comparable to those of other
autonomous institutions (e.g., El Salvador and Guatemala) in Central America.
Annex 2 shows that ICE's tariffs are higher than those of.the telephone admin-
istrations of Honduras and Nicaragua, but since the latter receive general
budget funds, their tariff structures, while lower, are not directly comparable.
Existing Facilities
2.08      Since initiation of its first automatic exchange in 1966, ICE has
expanded its network to include 65,000 lines of installed capacity in all



- 3 -
principal cities of the country ard has begun to establish extensive rural
services. Local and long-distance service, although recently hampered by
exchange congestion, is generally of good quality. Public telegraph service,
presently unsatisfactory, is expected to improve beginning in 1975, when ICE
will assume responsibility for it. International service is of satisfactory
quality. Details of existing telecommunications facilities and ongoing
works in Costa Rica are shown in Annex 3.
Rural Telephone Study
2.09      In view of the importance of adequate telecommunications to rural
development, ICE, the University of Costa Yhica and the Bank have begun a
study to determine:
-    the factors which influence the growth of demand for rural
telephone services; and
-    the social and economic effects on rural zones of the country,
resulting from the installation of the rural telephone system.
The study, which is to be completed in early 1975, is expected to aid ICE's
telecommunications section with information that will be useful in planning
the future development of rural telephony.
Future Development
2.10      By introducing and operating the national telex/gentex service
commencing in 1974, by taking over the public telegraph service in 1975,
and by absorbing all international operations by 1977, ICE will become
Costa Rica's only telecommunications company. This will enable ICE to
plan a balanced program for the country's telecommunications development,
including prospective new services such as data transmission, voice and video
transmission for broadcasting, and ship-to-shore communications.



-4-
3. THE BORROWER
3.01      The borrower would be ICE, a government-owned autonomous institu-
tion originally established in 1949 to plan and carry out a national electri-
fication program. A 1963 law authorized ICE to provide telecommunications
service within the country; and a 1964 law gave RACSA (with ICE as a 50%
owner) a 13-year concession Lo provide international telecommunications
services.  The law setting ul IGE defines it as an autonomous organization,
authorized to carry out its activities completely independently of the Govern-
ment, except for approval of tariffs and bond issues (paragraph 2.05). Ex-
cept for an assessment designed to pay the operating cost of SNE, ICE is
exempt from all taxes.
Organization and Management
3.02      The composition of ICE's board of directors and its organization
structure is outlined in Annex 4.  Its telecommunications management is
young, well-qualified and dedicated.
3.03      The only substantial change in ICE's organization since the previous
appraisal report (No. PU-77a, dated January 1972) has been the replacement of
seven divisions, each reporting to the general manager, with three sections
(for power, telecommunications, and finance and administration), each with
its own deputy manager. This change was a step in the right direction, rec-
ognizing the importance of the telecommunications section in ICE and prepar-
ing it for the incorporation of telegraph and international services in the
near future.
3.04      Previous Bank missions had urged ICE to consider organizational
separation of its two principal services, and ICE engaged management consul-
tants (Urwick International of UK), financed by loan 800-CR, to study this
matter. As detailed in Annex 4, Urwick's recomendations would reverse the
progress toward sectional independence taken by ICE. To allow each of its
two operating sections to continue to have the flexibility necessary to meet
the needs of the sector it serves, ICE agreed during negotiations to
the continuing separate operation of its electric and telecommunications
sections, allowing each of them responsibility for all planning, engineering,
construction and operation directly related to its own sector and providing
for central responsibility only for those activities not directly related
to provision of service, namely, policy planning, legal, personnel adminis-
tration, accounting, treasurer, auditing and administrative services, includ-
ing computer operations.
Staff and Training
3.05      ICE has a total staff of approximately 3,950, of which the telecom-
munications section has 1,222 full time employees, including 56 executives
and engineers.  This corresponds to a staff of 18.7 per 1,000 telephones,
which is a satisfactory overall ratio for a developing country, especially
considering that the telecommunications section does much of its own instal-
lation work. The technicians are well-trained, and the installations are
well-kept, partially because none of them is over ten years old.



-5-
3.06      With the growing network ICE has planned an increase of its tele-
communications staff to a total of 2,680 employees in 1977 (20 per 1,000
telephones). The increase in technical personnel will be greatest - from
447 maintenance technicians in 1973 to 1,10i in 1977 - in order to operate
and maintain adequately the expanding and innreasingly sophisticated network.
3.07      ICE's telecommunications section has already established a train-
ing program, utilizing ITU experts, senior ICE personnels and other instructors
from international institutes in courses for technical (and, to a lesser
extent, administrative) personnel at ICE headquarters. Equipment suppliers
have also provided technical training in Costa Rica and overseas. To meet
the needs of a system growing in size and sophistication, the training
program would be expanded considerably, as detailed in Annex 5 and summarized
below:
1973          1977
Number of instructor-years:
Technical                                  8.6           19.6

Financial Systems and Auditors
3.08      Under previous loans, ICE agreed to maintain separate accounts for
power and telecommunications arnd to have its accounts certified by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. ICE has complied with these covenants: its
accounts are complete and prepared reasonably promptly; its auditors are Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell & Co., which is acceptable. These covenants have been re-
peated in the proposed loan agreement.

4.  THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
I4.ol     ICE's telecommunications investment program to 1980 consists of
ongoing works in the Stage III (1972-76) expansion plan and new works in
the overlapping Stage IV (1974r80) plan.  ICE proposes to complete the Stage
P,V plan in two phases: (a) Stage IV A from 1974-77 and (b) Stage IV B from
1978-80.  The total cost of the Stage IV plan is estimated at US$107 mil-
lion with a foreign exchange component of US$56.5 million; its main items
are shown in Annex 6.
The Project
4.02      The Project, which is Stage IV A, consists of:
a.  E!xpansion of the telephone network capacity totalling 56,300
exchange lines, by adding 21,300 lines to 28 existing exchanges
and installing 35,000 lines in 14 new exchanges, together with
associated expansion of cable network, distribution facilities
and buildings to permit connection of an additional 36,300 DEL's;
b.   expansion of long-distance network capacity by some 2,500 trunk
circuits, consisting of about 2,300 working circuits on existing
and new microwave, coaxial and carrier cable systems and some
200 circuits on existing and new VBF and UHF spur routes; extension
of existing trunk exchanges by 1,100 lines; and installation of
three new trunk exchanges providing an additional capacity of
2,100 lines;
c.   expansion of the rural telephone system to cover an additional
90 localities by use of open-wire lines, carrier and radio systems
of the long-distance network;
d.   expansion of the telex/gentex exchange in San Jose by 250 lines
and the national telex/gentex network by 80 new VFT channels; and
e.   expansion of training facilities, employment of instructors and
technical consultants and purchase of training equipment.
Details of the planned exchange capacities are shown in Annex 3; of the long-
distance-network, on the map; of the training program, in Annex 5; and of the
project service targets, in Annex 7.
Cost Estimate
4.03      The cost of the project, which totals US$54.2 million with a
US$30.8 million foreign component, is summarized below. Details showing
the cost breakdown by year and service category are given in Annex 8.

I ICE app:ies interest at a fixed percentage rate to all projects under con-
structicn; hence, while much interest during construction is foreign in
origin, it is shown as local because it is not specifically identifiable.
The foreign cost estimates are based on price quotations obtained in 1973 by
ICE from various manufacturers. Costs are reasonable for the scope of the
project, which includes extension of service beyond the main centers into
smaller towns and expansion of the tandem (traffic routing) exchanges in San Jose.
4.04      Because ICE's telecommunications section has already decided on the
telephone and telex exchange capacities and radio equipment terminals to be in-
cluded in the project, the only foreseeable quantity variation would be in
categories affected by final design and execution, such as local cables and
civil works. Consequently, physical contingencies were estimated at about 20%
of the network portion of local system expansion, or US$1.62 million.
4.05      In its feasibility study, ICE included annual local and foreign price
contingencies of 10% and 5%, respectively, based on its recent experience. To
offset the recent tendency towards steeper rates of worldwide inflation, the
appraisal mission increased the foreign contingency allowance by US$2.5 million,
resulting in an overall price contingency allowance of 15% of direct cost
totalling US$5.46 million. Since contracts for most items to be included in
the project are expected to be signed by mid-1975 at the latest, these contin-
gencies appear reasonable.

Total                                             y-70
Procurement
4.07      Procurement of all equipment and materials to be financed by the
proposed loan would be subject to international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's.guidelines-for procutrement, except for some
switching and transmission -equipment (amounting -to about US$4.0 million) to
extend existing installations where direct compatibility is essential; this
equipment would be purchased direc,tly from three suppliers with whom the
original contracts were placed following international competitive bidding
under previous Bank loans.
4.08      In previous lending:operations, the Bank agreed that manufacturers
from the Central American Colmon Makoet'(CACM), including those in Costa Rica,
would be allowed regional/domestic preferenees.  ICE has requested a similar
arrangement in the proposed loan. In accordance with the Central American
Agreement on Fiscal Incentives fbr Industrial Development, manufacturers
from the CACM, including those in Costa'Riea, iwould be allowed a regional
preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price or the CACM preferential tariff, which
is 50% of the applicable;eicteirnal tar-iff, whichever is lower.  The items most
likely to be competitive under this arrangement are wood telephone poles,
cables and PVC ducts; their total-cost is not expVected to exceed US$2.5 million.
4.09      Because of long procurement lead time, ICE would have to make
commitments before-loan approval for goods with a value of some US$6.0 million,
including US$1.8 million for the'direct purchases mentioned in-paragraph 4.07
above. No retroactive financing would be required.
Disbursement
4.10      Disbursements under the loan would be made against the C&F costs



-9-
of imported equipment, 95% of the ex-factory costs (to exclude local taxes
included in the manufacturers' prices) of contracts awarded to Costa Rican
manufacturers,and the foreign exchange costs of consultants' and training
experts' services.
4.11      A schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements from the proposed
loan is shown in Annex 9. Because of the ongoing nature of Costa Rica's
telecommunications expansion, any unused loan balance could be applied,
after consultation with the Bank, to the purchase of additional goods
similar to those procured under the loan.
Project Execution
4.12      ICE's timetable of exchange installations is given in Annex 3 and
the construction program for the new long-distance systems in Annex 10. The
project is expected to be completed by December 1977.
4.13      As it has in past projects, ICE's telecommunications staff, with
assistance from manufacturers' engineers in the case of larger installations,
will plan, engineer and install the equipment included in the project. Wlth
the experience it has gained in the past, ICE's staff is capable of accomp-
lishing these tasks successfully.
4.14      Performance indicators showing the expected achievement during the
project period are shown in Annex 11.

5.  JUSTIFICATIONT OF THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
5.01      Costa Rica does not presently have adequate telecommunications
service due to:
i.   thecongested long-distance and local telephone network;
ii.   the long waiting list of applicants for telephones; and
iii. the limited telex/telegraph network.
The project objectives are to:
a.   improve the quality of service to existing subscribers by
relieving congestion;
b.   meet the demand for new telephone service;
c.   extend and improve telex/telegraph services; and
d. improve telecommunications services in rural areas.
Market Demand
5.02      Growth in connected subscribers (DEL's) has averaged 18.0% per year
over the past eight years. This strong demand cannot be attributed to low
telephone tariffs, since ICEts tariff levels have been high enough to produce
rates of return of 15-18% on the rate base. In December 1973, there were
16,600 waiting applicants. Annex 12 shows the past and forecast subscriber
growth.  ICE has based its demand forecast on: past experience; surveys
conducted for new exchanges; projected comiercial, industrial and urban
growth; and allowance for tariff inpreases.  Mainly because of expected
increases in installation fees and tariffs (see paragraph 6.15), ICE has
projected a lower annual rate of growth in demand - 10% - during the project
period.  These forecasts appear reasonable.  ICE plans to reduce the waiting
list to 1,700 by the end of the project period.
5'.03     The demand for long-distance traffic is based on traffic and circuit
forecasts carried out with the assistance of TTU staff, which took into account:
(i) the increase in number of telephones, (ii) growth of traffic, and (iii)
improvement in quality of service. ICE's long-distance program has been based
on individual traffic estimates for all routes. The forecasts show an expected
annual traffic growth rate of 14%, rwhich is in line with previous experience
in the country.
5.04      While rural service is often initially unprofitable, ICE believes
that its large rural expansion program is justified by the social and economic
benefits which improved communications bring to rural areas; inclusion of rural



- 11 -
expansion as part of a balanced national expansion program appears reasonable.
5.)5      Statistical data gathered by ICE have shown a rapidly growing need
for adequate message services, estimated at a 24% annual growth in messages,
for both private subscribers and public customers.
Least-cost Solution
5.06      ICE's telecommunications section made fundamental decisions in the
late 1960s which will determine Costa Rica's basic network structure over
the next decade. These decisions, which include the national numbering,
charging, switching and transmission plans and the choice and disposition
of coaxial cable and microwave systems for the long-distance network, were
soundly based and provide the framework for future telecommunications ex-
pansion, including the facilities to be provided in the project,
5.07      Optimizing the design of large works in the project has been achieved
by making present-value studies of the capital and operating costs of engineer-
ing alternatives over a 20-year period, using a discount rate of 14%, which
approximates the opportunity cost of capital in Costa Rica. For the remaining
small works, NTS' engineers have used present-value studies to obtain generalized
solutions for each class of plant and to reach decisions about the particular
plant type and size to be selected. Thus the project represents the least-
cost solution to meet NTS' needs.
Return on Project Investment
5.08      The rate of return on the project - defined as the discount rate
wlhich equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the project
with the capital and operating costs - is 21.1% (see Annex 13). If the
project's investment and operating costs are increased by 10% and revenues
attributable to it decreased by 10%, its rate of return would be a still-
acceptable 13.5%. In these calculations, it has been assumed that revenues
attributable to the project will be increased to offset increases in the
project's operating costs caused by infiation. The economic rate of return
is undoubtedly higher because (i) the prices charged do not adequately measure
the full benefits to subscribers, especially commerce, industry and agriculture,
(ii) the costs include the full cost of extending service to new areas even
though the full benefits would be obtained only when all potential subscribers
in those areas are connected

6. FINANCE
Introduction
6.01      ICE's NTS has maintained a high rate of return - from 14 to 18% -
since initiation of automated operations in 1966 until 1973, but its rate of
return is expected to decline to about 11% in 1974. Because of recent Costa
Rican price inflation, the NTS rate base is now undervalued. If the rate base
were valued properly, the NTS' rate of return would be reduced somewhat from
its stated level. NTS will need a significant tariff increase - about 50% -
to finance a reasonable portion of its ambitious expansion program; with such a
tariff increase, its financial performance is expected to remain satisfactory.
ICE's other section, the National Electric System (NES) has had severe finan-
cial difficulties because of construction cost overruns, dependence on medium-
term financing and inadequate electric tariffs. Wilth a 40% tariff increase
put into effect in March 1974 and further expected increases to compensate for
exchange-rate unification of the colon, NES' financial performance is expected
to recover to a satisfactory level,
National Telecommunications System
Earnings Record and Financial Position
6.02      NTS has had a high rate of growth in revenues and operating income,
both of which increased by more than 200% in the 5-year period through 1973.
ICE's law requires capitalization of its earnings; NTS' retained earnings have
financed in a large part the 100% growth in its net assets during this period.
NTS' income statements and balance sheets for 1971-73 are shown in Annexes 14
and 15, respectively.
6.03      NTS was originally capitalized by advances from NES and a small
(01 million) government contribution. Consequently, in its early years it
relied on debt to finance most of its construction program; as recently as
1970, more than 75% of its capital structure consisted of debt. Continued
capitalization of high earnings decreased NTS' debt/equity ratio to 68/32
by 1972.
6.04      The Bank is NTS' principal creditor; 70% of NTS' long-term debt at
year-end 1972 consisted of three Bank loans. NTS' remaining debt is composed
of bonds sold to Costa Rican investors, loans from CABEI and other financial
institutions, and suppliers' credits. To increase the attractiveness of its
bonds to local investors, ICE has entered into repurchase agreements obliga-
ting it to redeem them after 30 days' notice. Wile ICE has had no redemp-
tion problems in the past, in order to reduce its exposure to unpredictable
demands in the future, ICE has agreed to repeat existing loan covenants limit-
ing the principal amount of bonds outstanding under repurchase agreements to
no more than 30% of the total outstanding bonds. ICE has complied with this
covenant, at November 30, 1973 the proportion was 24%. Annex 16 shows NTS'
outstanding debt at December 31, 1972 and future debt service during the
project period.
6.05      ICE's books of account at year-end 1972 did not reflect various
currency realignments which had occurred in 1971-72 and consequently under-
stated its indebtedness. During the appraisal mission ICE and its auditors
agreed to correct this situat'ion in 1973 and future accounts. Based on



- 13 -
currency valuations at the time of appraisal, this would result in increas-
ing the value of NTS' indebtedness and assets by about 018 million (US$2.1
million), increasing the rate base value by about 10%.
6.06      A more significant under-valuatio.'i of ICE's rate base has resulted
from the recent steep price inflation in Costa Rica, which approximated 25%
in 1973 as measured by the wholesale price index. If tariffs for utility
service are to reflect the real cost of providing that service, the rate base
used in their determination must also reflect its real value. Therefore, ICE
and the Government agreed to revalue the NTS rate base in a manner acceptable
to the Bank by October 1. Because establishment of the plant's reproduction
cost less observed depreciation would require a lengthy and expensive engineer-
ing appraisal, ICE intends to use indices of Costa Rican prices to establish
the current value of the NTS rate base.
6.07      The government and government-owned public institutions owed NTS
about 02.7 (US$0.3) million, or about one year's billings, at the time of
appraisal. It has agreed to pay this arrearage within two years of the
effective date and to keep its accounts with ICE current.
Expense Allocations
6.08      The Bank has expressed concern for some time about ICE's method of
allocating the costs of its administrative section to operations.  Under
current procedures ICE adds 5% of the construction expenditures for all pro-
jects as an administrative overhead and reduces operating expenses by a like
amount. It then distributes the remaining administrative expenses pro rata
to the direct expenses of the two operating sections. Because construction
expenditures have increased significantly in recent years, administrative
costs may have been overcapitalized: in 1970-72, about 50% of administrative
costs were capitalized, in contrast to about 25% in previous years. To pre-
vent possible misstatements of its earnings in the future, ICE has agreed to
have an independent public 'accounting or management consulting firm accept-
able to the Bank review its procedures 'for distributing administrative costs
and implement the recommended procedures after discussions with the Bank.
Financing Plan
6.og      During the four-year project period 1974-77, NTS' internal cash
generation, assuming implementation of a tariff increase by January 1975
(see paragraphs 6.13-16), will finance about 43% of its expansion program
plus additions to working capital. This internally-generated contribution
to expansion, which includes connection fees and other customer payments
totalling about 4% of the expansion program, is satisfactory, especially
in view of the fact that the net plant investment will increase by about
250% during the period. Borrowings will be required for the remaining 57%.
The following table presents a summary financial plan, details of which are
shown in the projected funds statement (Annex 17).

6.10      The proposed Bank loan would be made to ICE for a term of 20 years
including four years of grace at the current Bank interest rate.  It would be
guaranteed by the Republic of Costa Rica.
6.11      ICE has entered into negotiations with CABEI for a 019.8 (US$2.3)
million loan to finance extension of and improvements to the Costa Rican
portion of the Central American regional network. It is expected that this
loan would be for a 15-year term with one year of grace, level amortization
payments and 8% annual interest.
O.12      NTS would require other financing of 070 (US$8.2) million over the
project period, principally to finance extensions to existing installations
other than those financed by the proposed Bank loan and mobile telephone equip-
ment. NTS has had no difficulty in obtaining supplier or other commercial
financing for these purposes in the past, and it expects to obtain similar
finiancing in the project period. 'While this financing would require high debt
service (assuming a 6-year term and 10% interest), it forms a relatively small
part of total NTS financing. Consequently, NTS' overall debt service, detailed
in annex 16, is expected to remain reasonable.



- 15 -
Proposed Tariff Increases and Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.13      In past loan agreements ICE and the Government have agreed to set
telecommunications tariffs to achieve at least a 12% return on the NTS rate
base so as to finance a reasonable portion of the telecommunications expansion
program; actual rates of return for NTS have exceeded the stipulated 12% rate.
Over the longer term a 12% return will continue to be needed to finance tele-
communications expansion; therefore, agreements related to the proposed loan
repeat the previous provisions that ICE would earn at least 12% on the NTS
rate base, valued in accordance with paragraph 6.06.
6.14      To provide a reasonable contribution - at least 40% - to its ex-
pansion program, ICE's telecommunications section intended at the time of the
field appraisal to propose telephone tariff adjustments beginning in 1975
which would result in an overall increase in tariff levels of about 25%.
6.15      From June 1971 until March 30, 1974 Costa Rica had two rates of
exchange:
a.   the official rate (06.65 = US$1), used for certain transactions
approved by the Central Bank, such as debt service payments on
loans for national development, which were generally made by
international lending agencies to government institutions; and
b.   the free rate (08.60 = US$1), used for all other transactions.
On March 30, 1974 the government unified the exchange rate for all transac-
tions at the former free rate. This will result in additional revenue re-
quirements of about 25% in order t3 pay for increased debt service obliga-
tions and at the same time provide a minimum 40% of the costs of NTS' system
expansion. Instead of the 25% tariff increase originally conceived by ICE
(paragraph 6.14), an overall increase of about 50% in telephone tariffs now
appears necessary. As shown in Annex 18 a tariff increase of this magnitude
would result in returns of 14.6% to 18.6% (on a rate base revalued only to
reflect past currency realignments) during the project period. Full revalua-
tion of the rate base (to reflect price inflation as described in paragraph
6.06) would decrease the rate of return towards 12%.
6.16      Since ICE would need a prompt telephone tariff increase to carry
out its telecommunications expansion program, ICE and the government agreed
to increase its telecommunications tariffs to levels satisfactory to the
Bank by January 1, 1975 and maintain them at those levels until completion
of the project. In a supplemental letter, ICE and the government have con-
firmed that telecommunications tariff levels will be increased by at least
50% by January 1, 1975, which would be satisfactory to the Bank.
6.17      In the late 1960s SNE's period of review of an ICE electric tariff
increase application took almost two years. To avoid similar delays in
processing the forthcoming telecommunications tariff increase application,
SNE has confirmed in a supplemental letter that: it agrees with the loan
and guarantee agreement provisions regarding rate base revaluation and rate
of return (paragraphs 6.06 and 6.13, respectively); and it would approve any
tariff increase application to achieve the' minimum return within 90 days of
the submission of such application. Because ICE is to complete the revalua-



- 16 -
tion by October 1 (paragraph 6.06), the 90-day review period confirmed by
SNE would permit implementation of the new tariffs by the agreed-upon date
of January 1, 1975.
6.18      With the tariff increase detailed in paragraph 6.15, NTS' finan-
cial performance would remain satisfactory. During the project period, its
annual debt-service coverage ratio will vary from 1.7 to 2.9, its debt/equity
ratio will decrease from 76/24 to 63/37, and its current ratio will be at
least 1.4:1. Forecast balance sheets and key financial ratios are shown as
Annexes 15 and 18, respectively.
6.19      The debt service test included in existing loan agreements, where-
by ICE will not incur long-term debt without the Bank's approval unless NTS'
most recent 12-month internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times NTS'
maximum debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year, has been
repeated in the proposed loan agreement. Because NTS' future debt service,
including debt service of the proposed loan, will increase sharply, Bank
approval for ICE borrowing throughout the project period is expected to be
necessary.
Security
6.20      The Bankls previous loans have been secured by mortgages on power
and telecommunications properties, as are other loans by Costa Rican govern-
ment-owned lenders to ICE. ICE expects that the other lenders will release
their mortgages on ICE's property if thte Bank will release its mortgages.
Therefore, the proposed loan agreement, while providing that the loan would
be secured by new mortgages or extensions of existing ones, also obligates
the Bank to release its mortgages on ICE's property once ICE has obtained
full rele.aises from other lenders.
National Electric System
Earnings Record, Financial Position and Need for Electric Tariff Increases
6.21      Despite a high rate of return (11 to 12%, vs a 9% requirement in
loan agreements with the Bank) on a rate base which requires revaluation to
reflect recent price inflation (see paragraph 6.26), NES has had severe cash
difficulties in the past four years&because of: (i) cost overruns of more
than 100% on the Third Power Project; (ii) recourse to medium-term loans to
pay for those cost overruns and resultant high debt service; and (iii) in-
adequate tariffs.
6.22      After discussions with a Bank supervision mission in September 1973,
NES management agreed that its internal cash generation should be high enough
to pay for at least 25% of its 1973-78 expansion program. Cash requirements
to service NES' medium-term debt during the period are unusually high, so that
the relatively low 25% contribution-to-expansion ratio is acceptable.



- 17 -
6.23      To achieve the 25% contribution, ICE applied for electric tariff
adjustments in November 1973 which would result in an overall 40% increase.
It received the requested increase in March 1974.
6.24      The 40% electric tariff increase did not contemplate exchange-rate
unification (paragraph 6.15), which will increase in terms of colones the
foreign cost of NES' investment program and its foreign debt-service require-
ments, thereby necessitating an additional tariff increase of at least 20%.
ICE management informed the appraisal mission that it would request promptly
whatever electric tariff increases which exchange-rate unification necessitated;
effectiveness of such tariff increases would be a condition of appraisal of
ICE's next power project. Even with the additional tariff increase, NES' net
internal cash generation will cover only about 90% of its 1974 debt service
requirements; this unsatisfactory situation will improve in future years.
Construction Program and Financing Plan
6.25      To meet the country's electricity needs, ICE's power section has
planned a large construction program, including a new hydroelectric develop-
ment at Arenal; the estimated cost of the program is almost 01,300 (US$150)
million. To finance the program, ICE has requested loans of about US$39
and US$26 million, respectively, from IDB and IBRD.  Based on preliminary
cost estimates of the progran, NES' financing plan appears feasible. De-
tails of the program and financing plan are shown in Annex 19.
Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.26      NES' forecast income statements, balance sheet and key financial
ratios for 1974-78 are shown in AnnexeB 20, 21 and 22, respectively.  Its
forecast rates of return vary from 12.4% to 17.8% on a rate base revalued
only for currency realignments. In view of recent high rates of price in-
flation in Costa Rica, further rate base revaluation appears necessary; this
would be discussed with ICE during the power appraisal. Rate base revalua-
tion would reduce the NES rate of return closer to the 9% minimum specified
in existing loan agreements. Its annual debt service coverage would improve
from 0.9 in 1974, which is unsatisfactory, to 2.1 in 1978, which is acceptable.
Its debt/equity ratio would vary between 55/45 and 63/37, and its current ratio
would remain above 1.8:1 during the project period, both of which are satisfactory.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations ICE agre~ed to:
a.   continue the separate operat.on of its electric and telecom-
munications sections (paragraph 3.04);
b.   hire consultants to review its procedures for distributing
administrative costs (paragraph 6.08); and
c.   repeat covenants included in the Loan 801-CR project agreement
concerning:
(i)  separation of accounts for power and telecommunications
operations and audit of accounts by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank (paragraph 3.08);
(ii) restriction of' ICE bonds outstanding under repurchase
agreements (paragraph 6.04);
(iii) debt service coverage test (paragraph 6.19); and
(iv) security of the proposed loan (paragraph 6.20);
the Government agreed to:  pay overdue telephone bills to ICE and keep its
accounts with ICE current (paragraph 6.07); and ICE and the Government
agreed to:
a.   revalue the NTS rate base in a manner acceptable to the Ban:k
(paragraph 6.06);
b.   repeat existing covenants covering rate of return (paragraph
6.07); and
c.   increase telecommunications tariffs to levels satisfactory to
the Bank by January 1, 1975, and maintain them at those levels
until the project is completed (paragraph 6.16).
7.02      In supplemental letters:  ICE and the Government have confirmed
that the overall level of telecommunications tariffs will be increased by
at least 50% by January 1, 1975 (paragraph 6.16); and SNE has confirmed
that it wuld approve promptly ICE's application to increase telecommunica-
tions tariffs to achieve a 12% return on a revalued rate base (paragraph 6.17).
7.03      With the above assurances, the project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$23.5 million for a term of 20 years with a four-year
grace period.

impulse is a 5-minute local call or a period from 3 to 45 seconds for long-distance calls.  Under the
proposal, two cities close to San Jose - Heredia and Tres Rios - would be considered local rather than long-
distance.

APPRAISAL CF FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT - COSTA RICA
TNSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN COSTA RICA
Local Exchanges
1.        The local telephon3 network comprises 33 automatic exchanges
with a total installed capac:.ty of 65,430 lines and 55,933 subscriber
connections (DEL's) at the end of 1973. Most of the existing system was
established under ICE's Stage I (1966-70) and Stage II (1970-73) expansion
plans. The Stage III (1973-76) expansion will add 39,050 exchange lines to
the system, bringing it to a capacity of 103,350 lines distributed in 58
exchanges all over the country. Services are concentrated in the San Jose
metropolitan area. Page 3 gives details on type and capacity of the exist-
ing exchanges. The subscriber networks consist of primary underground duct
and cable distribution and overhead secondary distribution.
Long Distance Network
2.        San Jose is linked to the central highland cities of Alajuela,
Heredia, Tres Rios, Turrialba and Cartago by coaxial cable systems. Micro-
wave links connect San Jose with Liberia and the ports of Puntarenas and
Limon and with the southern region as far as Golfito and the Panamanian
border. Connections from provincial centers to their dependent terminal
exchanges are by open wire, VHF and UHF radio systems. During 1972 and 1973
the interurban traffic increased much faster than previously expected. As a
result the principal trunks which interconnect the most important exchanges
have experienced extreme congestion. To cope with this demand ICE has requested,
and the Bank has granted, a reallocation of the proceeds of Loan 801-CR, trans-
ferring some US$3.3 million between categories. This allowed a basic equip-
ment change in the existing microwave and coaxial system from 300 to 960
channel capacity, reemploying the redundant equipment on new routes. The trunk
system so conceived will be capable of carrying the traffic without problems.
3.        There were 1,679 long distance circuits in service at the end of
1973; they are being increased to 3,661 under the Stage III expansion plan.
The main trunk routes are shown on the telecommunications map. The main
trunk exchange of San Pedro in the San Jose area is the hub of the network,
with long distance circuits to all other exchanges. Nationwide Subscriber
Trunk Dialing (STD) is available from virtually all exchanges and operates
quite efficiently, although recently hampered by congestion in the busy hours.
Rural Services
4.        Public call offices, now available at some 100 locations, are served
either through radio links (UHF or VHF) or by cable links. They will be ex-
tended under Stage III expansion to & total of 644 locations, covering mostly
remote small towns and villages.

Telegraph and Telex
5.        The public telegraph service is at present operated by the Ministry
of Interior, employing obsolete morse signalling equipment on open wire and
some HF radio circuits. The service is poor and for the most part is avail-
able only in the main towns and villages throughout the country. ICE has
plans to absorb this service in 1974-75, replacing the existing network by
a combined gentex and public telephone network.  To gain experience ICE
already operates a limited point-to-point teleprinter network consisting of
several telegraph offices with 30 teleprinters. During the Stage III ex-
pansion this will be extended to 3C gentex offices with 46 teleprinters i-n
the network.
6.        National telex service will begin after installation of the automatic
telex/gentex exchange in early 1974, procured under the Stage III plan.  Some
240 telex subscribers are connected directly to an international manual ex-
change in San Jose operated by RACSA.
International Services
7.        Until 1971 RACSA operated almost all international telephone, telex
and telegraph traffic. Telephone service has been greatly improved and
rapidly increased since the beginning of the operation of the Central American
Microwave (COMTELCA) network in November 1971. In December 1973 the automatic
International Telephone exchange was inaugurated, enabling the introduction of
automatic dialing to the USA and Canada. During 1974 automatic service will
be provided with Mexico and the other Central American countries. ICE operates
the telephone service with the Central American countries and the station-to-
station portion of the UISA and Canada traffic. At present, there are 43 out-
going circuits to Mexico and other 'Central American countries and 50 circuits
to USA and the rest of the world, using the CONTELCA network, satellite ground
stations in Panama and Nicaragua and the submarine cable which terminates in

Mobile Telephone System
8.        The Stage III expansion plan included a pilot project to introduce
limited mobile telephone facilities to cater to the specialized needs of
medical and other high-priority users. During 1973 and 1974 about 60 services
.Ire to be set up to make use of pilot plan equipment. If the demand develops
as forseen by ICE's market survey, this pilot plan will be the basis for the
development of a larger commercial system for the whole country.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS FROJECT - COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAAD (ICE)
ORGANIZATION, MANACEMENT AND SEPARATION
Organization and Management
1.        ICE has a seven-member board of directors, one of whom is the
Minister of Public Works serving ex-oficio. The other board members are
appointed by the government for eight-year terms on a staggered basis and
are eligible for re-appointment. Prior to 1970, Costa Rican laws specified
the composition of ICE's board by profession of its members; that provision
was replaced in that year by another specifying their political affiliation.
The political party in power nominates four members of the board, and the
opposition, three. While this provision appears unduly restrictive, ICE's
board membership has maintained sufficient continuity; two board members -
the president and vice-president - have served since ICE's inception,; and
a third since 1954.
2.        In the past, Bank appraisalshave observed that the frequency of
board meetings(which average eight pr nine per month) appeared excessive
and might result in too little responsibility being delegated to management.
Frequent board meetings and board aithority over comparatively minor matters
=-e customary in Costa Rica's public institutions, as well as those of neigh-
boring countries.
3.        The board appoints ICE's general manager, three deputy managers,
treasurer and auditor. The general manager appoints other officials, sub-
ject to board approval for senior posts.
4.        Prior to April 1973, seven divisions reported to ICE's general
manager. Four of these related to electric operations, one to telecommuni-
cations, and two to accounting and administrative matters.  In 1973, ICE took a
large step towards autonomy of its two operating seetions by creating three deputy
managers:  one each for power, telecommunications and administrative services.
5.        While ICE's present organization does not separate the two operat-
ing sections as much as previous Bank missions had suggested - e.g., it does
not include separate accounting systems or personnel relations for each
section - it does establish reasonable autonomy for each, subject only to
the general manager and the board. Responsibilities remaining under the
deputy manager for finance and administration are only those which do not
relate directly to provision of electric or telecommunications service,
leaving each operating section free to carry out its own planning, engineer-
ing, construction and operations. In view of the determination of its board
to maintain ICE as a single institution 'responsible for both services in
Costa Rica, the present organization is reasonably satisfactory.

6.        As shown in the attached organization chart, ICE's telecomunica-
tions section has three divisions:  engineering, which has responsibi.lity
for economic studies and planning as well as system design and engineering;
construction; and operations. This organization appears adequate for ICE's
immediate needs, but may require further division of responsibility as ICE
takes over telegraph and more international services.
Organizational Separation
7.        Authorizing ICE, which was at the time a conparatively well-managed
and financially viable public institution, to provide telecommunications in
addition to power was an effective method of instituting nationwide telecom-
munications service in the mid-1960s. However, previous Bank missions have
observed that the lack of separation of responsibility for the two services
would eventually have detrimental results to one or both of them, particularly
as the size of both operations grows, because of: their distinctness from
planning, technical, operational and marketing points of view; and the in-
ability of a single board and general manager to cope with increasingly com-
plex problems ofthe two divergent sectors. In negotiations on the fourth
power and third telecommunications projects (Loans 800-CR and 801-CR, respec-
tively) ICE agreed to hire management consultants to study, inter alia, the
degree of autonomy desirable for optimum provision of each service.
8.        The management consultants (Urwick International of the UK) have
proposed expansion of the number of deputy managers from the present three
to six. In addition to the existing deputy managers for power and telecom-
munications, the consultants have recommended officials at the same level
for finance, personnel, management services and customer services; they also
have recommended the establishment of a corporate planning office, reporting
directly to the general manager. Besides creating an organization over-
loaded with administrative functions, the consultants' recommendations would
remove from the two operating sections responsibilities directly related to
the provision of electric and telecommunications service. Specifically, the
deputy manager for finance would be responsible for financial planning for
the two operating sections and economic studies to support their plans; the
corporate planning office would coordinate all plans; and the deputy manager
for customer services would be responsible for both electric and telecom-
inunications services. The Bank has informed ICE and the consultants that
their recommendations appear undesirable because they would erode measures
toward sectoral autonomy already taken by the utility.
9.        ICE has subsequently indicated that its corporate planning office
would be for policy planning, and that it intends to establish joint electric/
telecommunications customer service offices on a pilot basis in a few localities.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT - COSTA RICA
INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYTEEM (NTS)
TRAINING PROGRAM
1.        ICE's telecommunications section has begun a training program for
its technical staff and to a very limited extent, for administrative personnel.
Most training has been carriedout at ICE's San Jose headquarters, using
senior ICE staff and foreign technical experts, mainly from ITU or other
Latin American telephone companies.
2.        To meet the increased demands of a telecommunications system grow-
ing in size and complexity, the telecommunications section has planned to
more than double its training program in terms of numbers of instructors
and classrooms by the end of the project period. Details of this expansion
and its rationale are shown on page 2 of this annex.
3.        The cost of the program over the four-year project period is
estimated at 023.2 (US$3.5) million, as detailed in page 3 of this annex.
4.        In the past, ICE has provided basic training for its new employees.
As the capability of Costa Rica's Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje to provide
training in basic skills increases, ICE should utilize that school for basic
training, thereby reducing the cost of its own training program. This will
be discussed with ICE during project supervision.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEMAND IN COSTA RICA
Local Telephone Service
1.        Growth in connected subscribers (DEL's)  has averaged 18.0% per
year from the initiation of the automatic telephone system in 1966 to
December 1973. At present, there is a waiting list of some 16,600
applicants. In the past, total demand, which consists of existing DEL's
and waiting applicants, has exceeded expectations so thatpractically all
exchanges are presently saturated.
2.        Past and forecast subscriber growth and exchange capacity are shown
below:

1973        65,400         55,933       16,597            72,530           84,346
1974        83,200         69,396       10,746            80,142         104,094
1975       117,130         84,396        1,992            86,388          126,594
1976       124,750         93,984        1,172            95,156          140,976
1977       142,400        105,683        1,714           107,397          158,525
3.        ICE has based its demand forecasts on:  past experience; direct
surveys conducted for new exchanges; projections of commercial, industrial
and urban growth; and allowance for tariff increases. A decrease demand
growth is expected as a result of expected increases in installation fees
and service charges (paragraphs 2.06 and 6.15 of the text) in 1975, the first
since ICE took over telephone operations. ICE's projection of annual demand
growth averages 10% for the next four years as opposed to 18.1% for the past
four years. This will result in some 106,000 DEL's connected at the end of
the project period, and a decrease in the waiting list to 1,700. To eliminate
the existing accumulated demand and avoid any such accumulation at the end of
the project period, ICE's telecommunications section has used this forecast
for detailed dimensioning of the project.
4.        ICE's forecast is reasonable.  Any ero-r may be on the low side,
since: (i) in the past years the supply of teldphones has consistently lagged
behind demand; (ii) the past demand figures used in the forecast did not take
latent demand into account; and (iii) experience in other countries with
similar past performance would indicate a higher rate of growth in future
demand   If actual demand does exceed ICE's forecasts, ICE's telecommunications
section would consider accelerating implementation of Stage IV B.



ANNEX 12

Long Distance Service
5.        The demand for long distance traffic is based on traffic and
circuit forecasts carried out with the assistance of ITU staff, which took
into account: (i) increase in number of telephones; (ii) growth of traffic;
and (iii) improvement in quality of service. ICE's long distance program
has been based on individual traffic estimates for all routes. Their fore-
casts show an expected annual traffic growth rate of 14%, which is in line
with previous experience in the country.
Rural Telephone/Telegraphs Services
6.        Rural telecommunications service, which is subject of a study in
which the Bank is participating (paragraph 2.09 of the text);'will, as part
of the Third Telecommunications Project, be expanded to serve 644 communities
by 1976. This large increase (about 100 rural communities were served at
year-end 1973) is in response to demand for improved teleconMunications
expressed by rural population and local governmental authorities. The project
would provide service to about 90 additional communities, mostly in 1977.
While rural service is often unprofitable, ICE believes that its large rural
expansion program is justified by the social and economic benefits which
improved communications bring to rural areas.  In view of these benefits,
inclusion of rural expansion as part of a balanced national expansion program
is reasonable.
Telex/Gentex Services
7.        Statistical data gathered by ICE have shown a rapidly growing need
for adequate message services, estimated at 24% annual growth in messages,
for both private subscribers and public cuItomers.  RACSA has 240 international
telex subscribers served by a manual excharige. With a new 720-line capacity telex/
gentex exchange, ICE and RACSA plan to introduce national/international telex
service, and ICE will introduce gentex service to carry public telegraph traffic
between the main cities.

Return on Project Investment
1.        The cost and benefit streams for the proposed investment are given
below and cover a period of 20 years, the assumed life of the project.
Construction costs are based on current equipment prices which are not expected
to vary significantly beyond the amount secured by contingency allowances.
Construction cost does not include interest during construction or any taxes.
Income and expenditure statements have been analyzed to extract cost and
revenues attributable to the project.

2.        The rate of return on the project - defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the project
with the capital and operating costs - is 21.05%.
3.        If construction costs were increased by 15% the rate of return would
be 17.5%. If the attributable revenues were decreased by 25% the rate of return
would be 15.75%. If construction and operating costs were increased by 10%
and revenues attributable to the project decreased by 10%, the rate of return
would be 13.45%.

INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE
With the assistance of ITU experts, ICE has estimated traffic on a country-by-country basis and has calculated
average tariffs based on average duration, distribution of calls between full-rate and reduced rate and between
station-to-station and person-to-person. ICE assumes that 60% of all calls to US and Mexico will be station-to-
station (and therefore handled by ICE), and that it will handle all international traffic when RACSA's franchise
expires in mid-1977.

b.   a Fifth power project, comprising a fifth 30 MW unit at the exist-
ing Rio Macho hydro plant, additional thermal generating capacity
necessary prior to completion of Arenal, and various transmission
and distribution works;
C.   initial work on the 3 x 52 MW Santa Rosa hydro development
downstream from Arenal; and
d.   other transmission, distribution and small generating works.
2.        ICE is also studying the feasibility of a large (about 800 MWJ) hydro-
electric development at Boruca for elompletion by 1980.  The Boruca project,
which would cost about US$300 million, would supply electricity to a proposed
aluminum complex being studied by Alcoa. Since this project is not included
in ICE's public-service construction program and its financing would presumably
be arranged separately from the financing of public-service facilities, it is
not included in this summary.
Financing Plan
3.        NES' 1974-78 financing plan, which assumes implementation of the
additional 20% tariff increase required by exchange-rate unification (see para-
graph 6.24 of the text), is summarized below. Internal cash generation would
cover 27% of its requirements.
a.   a US$39 million loan from IDB for Arenal, which IDB has already
appraised;
b.   a US$26 million Bank loan for the fifth project, which would be
appraised in late 1974 after receipt of NES' feasibility study;
c.   a 1974 commercial bank loan of US$10 million principally to
finance fuel inventories as required by the fuel supplier
(negotiations on this loan have begun);
