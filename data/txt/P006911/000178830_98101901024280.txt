PREFACE
1.        This report covers the Fourth Telecommunications Project in Costa
Rica supported by Loan 1006-CR. The loan for US$23.5 million to INSTITUTO
COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD, (ICE) was approved in June 1974, became
effective in November, 1979 and was closed in June 1981, two and a half
years after the original closing date.
2.        The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared in the Industry
Department of the World Bank on the basis of information and data supplied
by ICE, information gathered by the Bank project completion mission which
visited Costa Rica in October 1981, and discussions with ICE and the
Government.
3.        The comments of the Borrower have been incorporated in the PCR as
Annex 9.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1006-CR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Fourth Telecommunications Project on Costa Rica comprised the
first phase (1974-1977) of the Stage IV telecommunications development plan
(1974-1980) of INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE), an autonomous
Government-owned corporation providing electric power and telecommunication
services in Costa Rica.
2.        It followed the Third Telcommunications Project (Loan 801-CR) and
was a continuation of the expansion of the Costa Rican Telecommunications
System aimed at meeting part of the urgent demand for new telephone and
telegraph services in existing areas as well as extending services to new
areas. The objectives also included institutional improvements within ICE
in the areas of technical and financial planning. Both the physical and
institutional objectives were achieved (PCR paragraph 7.01).
3.        The project was fully completed in December 1979, two years
behind the original schedule. During implementation, the scope of the
project was enlarged with the Bank's agreement by about 30% to meet
additional demand. In spite of the 30% increase in the scope of the
project and 2 years' delay in completion, the total project cost was only
about 27% higher than the appraisal estimate.    ICE carried out the project
with diligence and efficiency, responding swiftly to changes occurring in
the demand as a result of changes in the economic situation. The actual
growth in registered demand between 1974 and 1979 was about 11.4% per year
compared to the forecast annual growth rate at project appraisal of about
10%. This resulted in a substantial unsatisfied demand at the end of
project.
4.        The four major tariff revisions made during the project period
were sufficient to allow ICE to meet the covenanted 12% rate of return on
ICE's revalued telecommunications assets. The internal financial rate of
return for the 1974-80 investment program was about 27% which compares
favorably with the appraisal estimate of 21%.
5.       Notable features of the Costa Rica's telecommunications system are
the high quality technical proformance of the system and the reasonable
number of staff required to operate and maintain the system (14 per 1,000
telephones).
6.        In conclusion (para. 9.01) the PCR points out that "by
successfully executing the fourth telecommunications project, and
skill-fully utilizing its human and financial resources, ICE contributed to
the national development of Costa Rica's telecommunications system and
demonstrated its competence as a successful entity."






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), an autonomous
Government-owned public corporation, provides all national and international
telephone services in addition to electric power. Its fully owned
subsidiary, Radiografica Costarricense S.A. (RACSA), operates the telex
service, and offers circuits for private rental. A 1964 law gave RACSA, at
the time a concessionary company 50% owned by ICE, the responsibility for
most international services including international telephone service which
was later transferred to ICE. ICE bought the remaining 50% of the shares of
RACSA in October 1975. In accordance with the law that established RACSA in
1964, ICE would have taken over the company in 1977. However, a new law
passed on July 27, 1977, maintains RACSA's identity for ten more years and
provides that the RACSA shares owned by ICE be nonnegotiable. Independently,
Junta Nacional de Comunicaciones (JNC), a government agency, operates the
existing domestic public telegraph network. JNC uses ICE's and RACSA's
infrastructures for national and international public telegraph services but
pays for the usage adequately to cover the costs.
1.02      The Servicio Nacional de Electricidad (SNE) is Costa Rica's
principal regulatory authority. It has jurisdiction over the tariffs,
technical standards and finances of ICE's electric and telecommunications
operations as well as over all other entities providing public electric,
water and sewerage services. However, SNE does not have jurisdiction over
RACSA. The government reviews SNE's decisions concerning tariff matters.
1.03      The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector in
Costa Rica since 1963 through five loans: a first loan (346-CR, October 10,
1963) of US$22 million was made for electric power and telecommunications
development; a second loan (632-CR, October 20, 1966) included US$6.5 million
for telecommunications development; a third loan (801-CR, June 2, 1971)
provided US$17.5 million, was granted to finance the third telecommunications
development project.   The first three projects have been completed.    A fourth
loan (1006-CR, November 19, 1974) provided US$23.5 million for
telecommunications development to finance the fourth development project
which has now been completed and is the subject of this report. The project
was estimated to cost US$54.2 million including foreign expenditure of about
US$30.8 million from which about US$23.5 million equivalent was to be
financed from the loan and the balance of the project's foreign cost by the
Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and suppliers'
credits.
1.04      A fifth loan to ICE (1532-CR) of US$10.6 million was approved and
became effective March 9, 1979, to finance ICE's fifth development project.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01       In September 1973, ICE made available to the Bank the feasibility
study for its fourth telecommunications development program. The project
identified for Bank support was essentially the first half (1974-77) of ICE's
Stage IV program for expansion of the National Telecommunications System
(NTS) through 1980. The appraisal took place in November/December 1973 and
negotiations for the loan took place in May 1974. The Bank's Board of
Directors approved the loan on June 10, 1974. The loan agreement was signed
on June 14, 1974.
Project's Objectives
2.02       The project as a part of a long-term plan was a continuation of the
earlier Bank-financed projects. ICE's Stage IV (1974-80) plan was proposed
to be completed in two phases: (a) Stage IVA from 1974-77 and (b) Stage IVB
from 1978-80. The total cost of Stage IV plan was estimated at US$107
miLlion with a foreign exchange component of US$56.5 million. The project
which is Stage IVA aimed at (a) meeting part of the urgent demand for new
telephone service in existing areas and extension of service to a number of
new areas, (b) expansion and improvement of the long distance telephone
services, (c) expansion of the rurdl telephone services, (d) expansion of
telex/gentex services, and (e) expansion of training facilities and
employment of instructors and consultants. The project also provided for
further institution building in ICE.
Project Description
2.03       The fourth project covered the following main items:
(a)  expansion of the telephone network capacity totaling 56,300
exchange lines, by adding 21,300 lines to 28 existing
exchanges and instalLing 35,000 lines in 14 new exchanges,
together with associated expansion of cable network,
distribution facilities and buildings to permit connection
of an additional 36,300 DELs;
(b)  expansion of long distance network capacity by some 2,500
trunk circuits, consisting of about 2,300 working circuits
on existing and new microwave, coaxial and carrier cable
systems and some 200 circuits on existing and new VHF and
UHF spur routes; extension of existing trunk exchanges
providing an additional capacity of 2,100 lines;
(c)  expansion of rural telephone system to cover an additional
90 localities by use of open wire lines, carrier and radio
systems for the long distance network;



(d) expansion of the telex/gentex exchange in San Jose by 250
lines and the national telex/gentex network by 80 new VFT
channels; and
(e) expansion of training facilities, employment of instructors
and technical consultants and purchase of training
equipment.
Covenants
2.04      The loan agreement provided that ICE should:
(a) appoint management consultants for allocation of
administrative costs to construction and operations (4.02);
(b) operate each of its telecommunications and power sections
separately, maintain separate records and separate
financial statements (5.01);
(c) submit financial statements audited within four months of
the end of the fiscal year (5.02);
(d) not issue bonds subject to repurchasing agreement before
maturity if the outstanding amount of such bonds is ldrger
than 30% of the total outstanding bonds (5.04b);
(e) achieve a 12% rate of return on revalued assets (5.05);
(f) properly allocate its administrative costs between power
and telecommunications and further between construction and
operations (4.02); and
(g) ICE telecommunications directorate not to Incur any long-
term debt unless net revenues are greater than 1.5 times
the maximum future debt service requirements (5.04a).
2.05      The guarantee agreement provided that the Government shall:
(a) enable ICE to increase and maintain its telecommunications
tariffs (3.03ii);
(b) enable ICE to revalue its fixed telecommunications assets
(3.03ii);
(c) pay all their outstanding debts to ICE for past services
rendered, within 24 months after effective date (November
1974) (3.04ii); and
(d) pay alL future debts to ICE for services rendered within
four months after the date of billing (3.04iii).



2.06       In supplemental letters ICE and the Government have confirmed that
the overall level of telecommunications tariffs would be increased by at
least 50% by January 1, 1975; and SNE confirmed that it would approve
promptly ICE's application to increase telecommunications tariffs to achieve
a 12% return on a revalued rate base.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01      The loan was made effective on November 19, 1974, about five months
after its signature due to time consuming legal actions in Costa Rica.
However, procurement actions were underway during the project's start-up, in
agreement with the Bank, and by January 1975, some US$10.0 million of the
loan had been already committed (out of US$23.5 million).
Revision of the Project
3.02       ICE had, in 1973, developed the telecommunications expansion
program for 1974-1980 called Stage IV; the first part of which, called Stage
IVA, was financed by the fourth loan of the Bank. In 1977, ICE decided to
remodel the second part of the original project (Stage IVB) and extend it to
the year 1981; ICE renamed it Stage V which was subsequently financed by the
fifth loan of the Bank. At the time of the appraisal of the fourth project,
changes in the scope of the third project caused inclusion of previously
identified exchanges and rural public call offices in the fourth project.
During 1977 ICE made several changes in the fourth project regarding
locations, quantities of equipment and the sources of financing of the
equipment. While not altering the basic objectives of the project, the
changes were made mainly to cope with increased demand in the metropolitan
area and were directed toward advancement of installation of the bigger
metropolitan exchanges expected to bring more revenue. The Bank agreed with
ICE's proposal for the changes.
3.03       ICE had financial problems due to the deteriorating econamy in the
country during the years 1974 and 1975 (paragraph 5.02), and as a result the
rural telephony program in the third project was further delayed. With an
improvement in its financial picture in 1976, ICE then accelerated the
installation of these rural public call offices (PCOs), but was not able to
meet the initial target of providing service to about 600 rural communities
under the third project by 1976. In mid 1977 the program under the third
project was reduced with the agreement of the Bank to provide service to a
total of 296 communities, the rest being carried over to the subsequent,
fourth project. At the end of the fourth project only 509 communities had
received service instead of the 734 initially envisaged.1 The main reasons
1/ However under an extended definition, a total of 632 communities have
received services, leaving a shortage of some 104 telephones,
representing 14%.



for the reduction and delay were: (1) a relatively low financial return of
the large investment per line in the rural areas; (2) construction and
maintenance problems, and (3) unexpected technical problems, resulting from
the use of radio links, in areas covered by dense forest and subject to
flooding. Details of the rural telephone component are given in Attachment 1
to Annex 1. ICE 's target was, as a result of sufficient experience gained
in the field of rural telephone development, to complete the fifth program's
target of having 1,000 communities connected by 1982. However, as a result
of the deterioration of the economic situation of the country beginning in
1980, ICE had to delay the execution of the rural telecommunications program,
and is now expecting to reach the target by the end of 1984.
Implementation Schedule
3.04      The project completion date was scheduled at appraisal as December
1978. Due partly to changes in project scope which enlarged the project by
some 30% to meet additional urban demand, a revised schedule was drawn up
(paragraph 3.02) in 1977 extending project completion to December 31, 1979.
Annex 1 gives details about project provisions, schedule, and variations.
The revised project was over 65% complete at year end 1979 and so were the
procurement arrangements. However, delays in the delivery of goods and the
time needed to permit final disbursement on small items necessitated three
more extensions of the loan closing date, first to September 1980, second to
March 31, 1981, and finally to June 30, 1981.
3.05      The main reasons for the delay from the appraisal schedule and in a
few cases behind the revised schedule were:
(a) financial difficulties as a consequence of the countrywide
economic crises in 1974 and 1975;
(b) changes in location and equipment requiring additional time
for reengineering;
(c) the extended project scope resulting in additional
procurement which introduced delays; and
(d) the problems faced by the rural program (financial and
technical).
Procurement
3.06      Procurement of the items included in the project was done in
accordance with the Bank guidelines and presented no difficulties. Direct
purchase of proprietary equipment for extension of existing switching and
transmission equipment to be financed by the Bank were estimated, at the time
of appraisal, to amount to US$4.0 million. Actually only some switching
equipment and teleprinters were purchased, amounting to a total of US$1.8
million; the rest of the direct purchases was financed by suppliers'
credits. Commitments before loan approval were estimated during appraisal at
about US$6.0 million including US$1.8 million for the direct purchase.
However, only US$2.8 million was committed by contracts entered into before
the date of signature of the loan.



- 6 -
3.07       During appraisal about US$2.5 million worth of goods was foreseen
to be procured from Costa Rican suppliers competing in ICE tenders. The
actual amount of purchased goods in Costa Rica financed by the loan amounted
to US$3.0 million. The increase is attributed to the expansion of local
network, where more goods from local suppliers were procured.
Project Cost
3.08      The estimated project cost as appraised and actual cost are

Total project cost                    200.87     30.83     267.81     37.66
The main reasons for the cost variations are explained below for local and
foreign cost separately.
Local Cost
3.09      As a result of the expansion of the project by some 30%, an
increased amount of local expenditure amounting to Colones 66.85 million or
33.3% more was necessary to execute the project. The main increase was
experienced in the local telephone system which increased by some Colones
68.6 million or 209%. This included the purchase of locally produced goods
for the expansion of the local network (see paragraph 3.08). The other
substantial increase was the Colones 25.2 million or 26.6% increase in
engineering, administration and overheads, which is in line with the 30%
increase in the project scope. The annual inflation rate in Costa Rica for
years 1974, 1975 and 1976 was about 25%.
Foreign Cost
3.10      The foreign cost increase amounting to total US$6.71 million
(21.6%) is attributable to the cost increase of the local telephone system by



some US$14.17 million (or 96%).    This increase was caused by the increase of
7,410 lines during the project or 13.2% increase over the appraisal
estimate.   Similarly, the outside plant was increased accordingly, ifhich in
turn, together with the higher-than-expected copper price, contributed to the
cost increase. Furthermore an investment for mobile telephone service
(US$0.19 million) was made which was not foreseen originally. On the other
hand, cost reductions were acheived in the long distance system and on the
telegraph/telex systems of 14.3% and 43.4% respectively. Similarly, some
savings occurred due to the fact that the payment of training and consultants
was performed from ICE's own funds.
Disbursement
3.11      The estimated and actual annual disbursements of the Bank's loan
are as follows:

1981            23,500         23,500              100.0
The delay in disbursement was a result of the delay in project execution.
Loan Allocation
3.12      The original, modified and final allocation of the loan proceeds is
as follows:



Loan Allocation
(US$OOO)
Original      Reallocation      Final

1.  Local telephone systems          13,800        16,490         17,004
2.  Long distance systems             5,300         5,060          4,651
3.  Rural and telex services            700         1,450          1,399
4. Consultants, training and
building services                1,200           500            446
5.  Unallocated                       2,500             -               -
TOTAL                          23,500       23,500          23,500
As a result of the project modifications (see paragraph 3.02), it was
necessary to accomodate the substantially different funding needs among the
several project components than those provided in the original allocation of
proceeds. In particular, there was a substantial increase (over US$3
million) in the cost of equipment for expansion of local telephone network
and for rural and telex services. The Bank agreed to this modification.
Operations
3.13      ICE is fully satisfied with the quality and performance of the
equipment supplied and plant obtained through contractors. As in the
previous projects, the equipment was supplied in accordance with the
specifications, which were reviewed with in the Bank and Its performance has
met the specific requirements. During the third project, ICE encountered
some technical problems in setting up some of the rural radio links, related
to propagation of electromagnetic waves in some wooded and flooded areas. As
the lower quality of transmission and stability was not related to defective
equipment but to the environment in which it was installed, ICE subsequently
changed the type of equipment to one using different band of frequency
spectrum which is now successfully being introduced.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.14      Under Loan 1006-CR, a management consulting firm was engaged to
review ICE's method of allocating costs, especially the overhead costs,
between operating expenses and capital costs (paragraph 5.12). The findings
of a first study by the consultants in June 1974 could not be implemented by
ICE because the recommendations were too elaborate and costly to operate. A
second study was therefore carried out by the same consultants and completed
in December 1975. The new proposed method was considered satisfactory in



- 9 -
principle and, with modifications suggested by the Bank, was used by ICE as
the basis for cost allocation.    In retrospect, the performance of the
management consultants was generally acceptable. However, closer
consultation at the beginning between the consultants and ICE in terms of
ICE's requirements and limitations could have avoided unnecessary and
duplicate efforts in devising the systems for cost allocation.
3.15       ICE had in the past some problems in forecasting demand and
planning its investment to meet fast changes in the needs of the economy
within available resources. With some assistance from a consulting firm, ICE
improved its engineering and traffic forecasting. During the preparation of
the fifth project, ten engineer man-years and three economist man-years were
engaged; as a result, a considerable improvement was made in planning for the
physical content of the fifth project.
3.16      The performance of contractors and suppliers was generally
satisfactory.   ICE has good technical personnel, fully capable of preparing
the specifications for and operating all types of equipment. ICE carries out
most of the cable installations by its own staff but also uses outside
contractors in rural areas. The exchange installations and transmission
network construction were carried out entirely by ICE's labor force during
the fourth project. The rural PCOs were installed partly by ICE and partly
by contractors selected on a competitive basis. ICE kept the Bank well
informed of the project's progress through the six-monthly progress reports
which were received regularly.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01       At the time of the appraisal, ICE was expected to provide
additional capacity for a total of 56,300 exchange lines, including 35,000
lines in areas which at the time had no service. The recorded unfilled
demand, at the time of appraisal was about 16,000. In December 1979, about
129,700 telephone connections existed, of which about 65,700 were provided
under the fourth project. The actual growth in demand achieved from the end
of 1973 through 1979 of about 11.4% was higher than the forecast annual
growth rate at appraisal of about 10%. Corresponding to this increase in
number of connected subscribers, and also due to the increase experience in
traffic per subscriber, ICE revised its plans and increased the installations
in local and long distance capacities which produced additional revenues to
ICE (paragraph 3.02). The telex and gentex traffic was also growing faster
than the envisaged 34% annually. The average growth of telex subscribers in
the six year period was about 26%. ICE reacted to larger than expected
demand by expanding the telex/gentex exchange faster than originally
planned. The quality of both telephone and telex service is reasonably good.
4.02      In general, ICE carried out the project with diligence and
efficiency, despite .the changes which were introduced to cope with unforeseen
circumstances and the financial difficulties resulting from the general
economic conditions. During the fourth project, ICE also caught up with the
delayed rural development program by fulfilling it to the extent of 86% of
the target (paragraph 3.03).

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01       Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) is an autonomous
corporation of the Government of Costa Rica. Under Loan 632-CR for the
second telecommunications project in 1969, ICE agreed to maintain separate
accounts for its activities. Since then ICE has been operating in accordance
with accepted commercial accounting practice and maintains separate accounts
for its electric and telecommunications services (NES for National Electric
System and NTS for National Telecommunications System, respectively).
5.02      During 1974 and 1975, Costa Rica's economy was seriously affected
by the world wide energy crisis. ICE's finances were also affected because
of high domestic inflation and a shortage of foreign exchange. Later, after
the economy recovered, ICE's financial position improved with proper measures
of cost control and tariff increases (paragraphs 5.05 and 5.06). ICE has had
few difficulties in raising tariffs to meet the inflationary pressures on its
operation. Since 1975, the operating results and the financial positions of
NES and NTS have been satisfactory.
5.03       The analysis presented below from paragraph 5.04 to 5.16
concentrates on the finance of ICE's telecommunications operation. The
performance of ICE's electricity branch is discussed in paragraphs 5.17 to
5.19.

5.05      In an attempt to improve productivity and to control expense
levels, ICE effectively controlled staff increases and maintained the number
of staff lower than the projected figures. This effort made a definite
impact on cost control even though increasing wages and other costs related
to local inflation offset some of the savings made available by restricting
staff increases; from FY74 to FY80, the operating cost per Direct Exchange
Line (DEL) measured in constant terms increased by less than 9% over the
six-year period.
5.06      With the increases in telephone traffic and the tariff revisions in
FY74, FY75 and FY81 (paragraph 5.09) ICE's operating revenues from its
telecommunications services increased at an average annual rate of over 30%
during FY74-80. Thus, revenues have been adequate to meet the operational
requirements and, at the same time, make a reasonable contribution to the
development program for the telecommunications services (paragraph 5.08).
5.07      Actual detailed sources and applications of funds of NTS for the
period FY74-80 is given in Annex 4. A summary for the entire period is
presented below:

5.08      As shown in the above table, NTS' actual net internal cash
generation for the originally anticipated project period of FY74-77 was about
37% of total funds requirement for canital construction and increases in
working capital; this ratio was lower than the appraisal estimate of 43%.
The lower than expected net internal cash generation ratio for FY74-77 was
partly due to the low tariff levels for the services before 1974 and partly
due to the delays in the completion of revenue-earning projects. With the
subsequent tariff increases and project completions by the end of 1980, NTS'
net internal cash generation improved to over 46% of the total sources of
funds for the period FY74 through FY80; this is considered satisfactory for
an entity which was growing as rapidly as NTS. The remaining funds
requirement during FY74-80 was financed from external borrowings including
IBRD (23%); other development banks (CABEI and IDB, 4%); commercial banks
(14%); bond issues (11%) and supplier credits and other (2%).

Tariffs
5.09      Under Loan Agreement 1006-CR, ICE and the Government agreed to set
the telecommunications tariffs at levels sufficient to generate revenues to
achieve at least 12% rate of return on NTS's revalued telecommunications
assets. This covenant has been complied with. The tariffs had four major
revisions during the project period:    first in January 1975, then in April
1976 and in January 1981, and more recently in July 1981. When compared with
the pre-1975 levels the present tariffs represent increases from 200 to
350%. Telephone tariffs in Costa Rica are still on the low side compared
with the USA expecially after considering the vast variation between the
official and the free market exchange rates (paragraph 5.11). However, ICE
has taken into account the changes in free market rates in billing for
international services in an effort to minimize the distortion caused by
disparity of exchange rates.
Asset Valuation
5.10      Under Section 5.05 of Loan Agreement 801-CR of the third project,
ICE was required to earn an annual rate of return of at least 11% on the
average value of NTS' fixed assets in operation. However, this requirement
was later changed under Section 5.05 of Loan Agreement 1006-CR of the fourth
project in order to take into account the effects of high inflation. ICE was
then required to achieve a minimum of 12% rate of return on NTS' revalued
assets starting from 1974. Because of opposition of the Central Bank, the
assets revaluation for the 1974 balance sheet scheduled to take place before
October 1, 1974, was not performed until 1975. A second revaluation was
subsequently carried out for 1974, to reflect the devaluation of the Colon
versus the US dollar for all transactions at the former free rate. In 1976
ICE did not revalue its assets; this was accepted by the Bank considering the
relatively low level of local inflation in that year. However, ICE did
revalue its assets at the end of 1977, using indexes covering 1976 and 1977.
Since then ICE's assets have been revalued each year.
5.11      Due to a deteriorating economy and a balance of payments problem,
the Government on December 16, 1980 suspended the fixed rate of exchange at
US$1.00 to Colones 8.60, which had prevailed during the previous seven
years. On December 31, 1980, the rate of exchange on the free market stood
at about US$1.00 to Colones 14.50 and the free market rate was about US$1.00
to Colones 37.0 in November 1981. Because of this, ICE will have to revalue
its foreign-currency long-term debt and the corresponding assets financed by
this debt. ICE discussed with the bank the methodologies of asset
revaluation for its NTS as well as NES branches. The Bank made comments on
the proposed methodologies and suggested further investigation by ICE on the
effect of devaluation while at the same time taking into account the
different aspects of telecommunications and electricity equipment as they
relate to replacement values of net operating assets.



- 14 -
Cost Allocation
5.12       Section 4.02 of Loan Agreement 1006-CR, required that ICE allocate
its administrative costs between the electricity and telecommunications
departments and between construction and operations, using methods of
allocation satisfactory to the Bank. Under the old system, ICE estimated the
administrative costs to be capitalized by using a single fixed percentage of
the total investment program cost and deducted the corresponding amount from
the operating expenses. This method tended to overcapitalize the
administrative costs under a large investment program and thus distort
operating expenses. As a consequence of studies by a management consulting
firm in 1974/75 (paragraph 3.14), the allocation was then done through the
use of a series of coefficients based on staff time and activities
allocation. The method has since been refined and is considered acceptable.
5.13      As ICE's organization has expanded and activities increased through
the years, the method of allocating general accounts, especially between the
two services needs further refinement and improvement. For example, both
telecommunications and electricity departments share a joint cash account.
The cash position of each department is not known before the end of the
fiscal year when the allocation of administrative overhead is done; any
change by the management in the selection of the allocation coefficients will
affect the allocation of cash between the two departments. This deficiency
tends to give an inaccurate picture of the cash balance of the two
departments. ICE's finance staff is aware of this problem and is devising a
better system to determine the allocation coefficients.
Billing and Collection
5.14       ICE's billing performance and the accounts receivable position of
NTS' private subscribers are satisfactory. As indicated in Annex 5, the
year-end outstanding balance for NTS' private accounts has improved from over
2 months in FY75 to less than a month of the yearly billing in FY80.
However, collection performance for Government users has been disappointing;
the year-end outstanding balance has been consistently over a year's
billing. In FY80, the Government finally settled with ICE all of its arrears
with NTS prior to 1975. But the accumulated outstanding balance as of
December 1980 was about Colones 25.4 million, or about 13 months of billing;
nearly 60% of the outstanding balance was overdue by more than a year.
However:
(a) as required by Costa Rican law, ICE has constantly pursued
this matter with the Government to keep current its claim
over Government's liabilities;
(b) the law does not permit ICE to write off this portion of
its accounts receivable from Government users;
(c) Government billing is relatively less compared to NTS'
other billings (only about 5% of total billing);



- 15 -
(d) ICE expects that the collection from the Government users
will improve after a new Government takes over in early
1982.
Audit
5.15      Loan Agreement 1006-CR requires that the annual audit report from
an independent auditor be furnished to the Bank by the end of April following
the close of the related fiscal year. This covenant has been complied with.
The external auditors at present are Messrs. Garnier and Munoz, affiliated
with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company. The external audit as well as
ICE's internal audit and control are satisfactory. For the future, the
implementation of an increasingly computerized accounting and budgeting
systems should improve further ICE's ability to prepare and finalize annual
accounts.
Bonds
5.16      Loan Agreement 1006-CR stipulated that ICE should limit the
outstanding amount of its bonds which was subject to repurchase before
maturity to no more than 30% of the total amount of all outstanding bonds.
This covenant has been complied with and in the last two years ICE has issued
less bonds than before because of the decline in the demand for its bonds due
to the high inflation and deterioration in the exchange rate.
National Electric System (NES)
5.17      The operating results and financial position of NES have been
generally satisfactory. Performance indicators of ICE's electricity
operations including market penetration and efficiency are given for FY78-80
in Annex 6.
5.18     Since 1975 NES has been able to maintain its operating ratio below
45% and the rate of return on average net revalued fixed assets has exceeded
the required 9% under the sixth power project financed by the Bank Loan
1730-CR.  However, the revaluation performed by ICE so far does not take into
account the effect of any changes in foreign exchange rates.     Due to the
recent exchange rate variations, ICE will have to revalue its long-term
foreign debt and, accordingly, the fixed assets financed by the foreign debt
(see paragraph 5.11).
5.19      With the authorization of the regulatory agency, Servico Nacional
de Electricidad (SNE), NES and other power companies Increased the basic
tariffs in January 1981. For ICE the increase helped generate about 30%
more revenues. Subsequently, the tariffs were again increased in July 1981
and generated about 18% additional revenues.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01       ICE is administered by a seven-member Board of Directors which
appoints ICE's general manager, three deputy managers (for power,
telecommunications and administrative services), the treasurer and the
internal auditors. Prior to 1977, the fairly autonomous telecommunications
directorate under the Deputy Manager, Telecommunications was divided into
three divisions: Construction, Operation and Engineering, the last had the
responsibility for economic studies and planning, including financial
planning as well as system design and engineering. In February 1977, a
fourth telecommunications division was set up to deal with international
telephone services. In addition, the administration and finance directorate
was divided in June 1977 into three divisions: Administration, Finance and
Personnel. The deputy manager of the telecommunications directorate of ICE
was made responsible for coordinating the complementary activities of ICE and
RACSA.
6.02       Based on a recommendation of consultants, more autonomy was granted
to both the power and the telecommunications directorate after 1973.
Separate systems of accounting and budgeting were devised, and different
accounting codes were assigned. Overall, the degree of sector autonomy and
the quality of management and organization effectiveness were generally
satisfactory.
6.03       ICE improved its planning oganization and under the fourth and the
fifth projects developed a long term plan of network expansion designed to
meet the demand for service. Because of difficulties relating to project
revision as a result of fast changes in demand, ICE realized the importance
of good project planning. As a result, ICE with the assistance from a
consulting firm improved its engineering and traffic forecasting (paragraph
3.15). This was instrumental in the preparation of the fifth project
financed by the Bank Loan 1532-CR.
6.04       During most of the project period, ICE's telecommunications
development activity was concentrated in the metropolitan areas. This was
the result both of the centralization in the administration of the country
and the priority given by ICE to the capital area of San Jose where the
demand and financial returns were the greatest. The government has lately
directed ICE to provide increased facilities to rural areas and provincial
towns. As a consequence, ICE is focusing on rural telecommunications
development and during the fifth project is decentralizng its operations by
creating 12 centers to aid its geographical and functional expansion to
provide basic telecommunications facilities in areas which are currently
poorly served (paragraph 3.03).



- 17 -
Growth
6.05       ICE has shown a steady growth in all aspects of its activity after
experiencing the temporary difficulties during 1974 and 1975 (paragraph
3.03). However, despite considerable service expansion, ICE has been unable
to meet the rapidly growing demand for service, not to mention the need for
better geographical coverage. Therefore, ICE planned its fifth project to
overcome these deficiencies.
Staff Recruitment, Training and Development of Staff
6.06       ICE's senior engineering and financial staff is generally competent
and has satisfactory experience in proper management. The middle and junior
personnel are qualified and closely supervised. A comprehensive training
program (paragraph 6.09) helps existing staff to master the rapidly evolving
telecommunications techniques and trains new staff for the expansion of the
network.
6.07       ICE's telecommunications staff, at the end of 1977, was about
2,727, 44% for operations, 27% for construction and the other 29% for
administrative and institutional purposes. During the difficult years of
1974 and 1975, both operations and administrative manpower decreased in line
with ICE's intention to reduce cost, and a strict recruitment policy has
succeeded in keeping the ratio of the number of staff to a low 14 per
thousand telephones 4which is lower than the 20 per thousand telephones
envisaged for 1977 in the fourth project.
6.08      One of the keys to ICE's successful operations was its management's
appreciation of the needs for training of its personnel at the early
development stage.   Arrangements were made with the Bank to finance part of
the training facilities starting with the third project in 1972. The
following tables give a general indication of the extent of [CE's technical
training at the end of the project in 1979.

6.09     The training program for telecommunications as outlined above was
reasonably comprehensive. The courses were designed to complement courses
offered by other technical schools in Costa Rica. In addition to this
in-house training facility, ICE also has training programs in general and
administrative areas and uses to a large extent training provided by the
Instituto Centro-americano de Telecomunicaciones (INCATEL) and by foreign
suppliers. ICE also organized seminars on telecommunications topics, often
jointly with other Central American countries.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01       The project has generally achieved most of the physical growth
targets and the institutional improvements envisaged at the time of
appraisal.   The revised program was fully executed except the rural
development program carried over from the third project. The consultant and
technical experts retained under this project helped finalize the studies and
strengthened the technical capability of ICE.
Least Cost Solution
7.02      Basic system design solutions for transmission and switching
systems were taken during the previous projects based on least cost
solutions. The expansion of the basic national network was planned and
executed to meet estimated demand for long distance and local traffic by
providing least cost solutions. Contrary to the third project where an
upward revision of the long distance network was made to cope with the
unexpected demand for long distance traffic, in the fourth project, due to
difficult economic situation in the country a substantial reduction in
revenues occurred. This prompted ICE to take additional cost-effective
actions (see paragraph 3.02) and advance some exchange installations in urban
areas which were expected to bring more revenues. At the same time, ICE



- 19 -
postpone some installations in provincial cities and reinstalled some
overhauled step-by-step exchanges in some rural areas as well as less costly
manual exchanges where lower demand was experienced.     This was, under those
circumstances, the most economical way to provide service. Also a few
small changes in the distribution and design of these exchanges to respond to
the actual demand where it differed from the initially estimated demand were
made to provide maximum service at the least cost.
Return on Investment
7.03      As outlined in Annex 8, the internal financial rate of return for
the 1974-80 investment program of which the project was an integral part was
re-estimated at about 27%.    This rate is representative for the project and
compares favorably with the appraisal estimate of 21%.The economic rate of
return should be considerably higher than the financial rate of 27% partly
for the following main reasons:
(a) no increase in the incremental revenues attributable to
this project has been considered as from 1980 onwards
despite existing spare capacity on certain facilities
installed under this program; and
(b) no indirect external benefits for other sectors
(transport, agriculture, public services, etc.) from
expanded and improved telecommunications services have
been included in the computation of the financial rate of
return.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall and Specific Performance
8.01       The project identified for Bank financing aimed at the provision of
facilities, at least cost. It was well conceived and the assumptions made for
its design were reasonable. During 1974 and 1975 when ICE faced financial
difficulties due to the sagging economy, adjustment to the telecommunications
investment program were made quickly to cope with the situation. The
original rural development plan was postponed, and after Bank objections,
quickly reinstated when the financial situation improved. The Bank's
reaction was prompt and resolute, which together with the government's
similar opinion encouraged ICE's management to reinstate the rural
development program in full although the execution was delayed. Similarly,
ICE's other cost saving actions were prompt and adequate and had the full
understanding and support of the Bank. A positive side effect of the
financial squeeze in 1974/75 was ICE's caution about new staff recruitment
which gave an exceptionally low 14 staff per 1,000 telephone's, a figure
which is extremely good for developing countries.



- 20 -
8.02       The other commendable performance of ICE influenced by the Bank,
UNDP and ITU was the establishment of ICE's Training Institute which
strengthened ICE's technical potential.    Following the administrative,
accounting and budgeting separation of the power and telecommunications
sections which was carried out during the third project, further improvements
in the refinements and the strengthening of accounting and budgeting
procedures were achieved during the fourth project. The Bank made a number
of efforts to encourage the Government pay its bills and, being an issue
during the fifth project appraisal new agreements were reached and it was
again covenanted in Loan 1532-CR.
Supervision
8.03      The Bank's project supervisory effort was adequate.     ICE sent a
progress report on its own activities and the project at six-month
intervals. These reports were carefully prepared and were sent regularly
although sometimes late, due to the delay in the manual computing of
financial data which is now being computerized.
Working Relationship
8.04      The working relationship between the Bank, the Borrower and the
Government has been uniformly good. The Bank's supervision missions did not
encounter problems in obtaining information from ICE or the Government. Even
at times of disagreement, ICE was ready to maintain a frank and open dialogue
with the Bank.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      By successfully executing the fourth telecommunications project and
skillfully utilizing its human and financial resources, ICE contributed to
the rational development of Costa Rica's telecommunications system and
demonstrated its competence as a successful entity. Overcoming some initial
constraints, ICE under this project, made considerable progress in extending
the telecommunication network and facilities to a substantial number of
population living in rural areas which had no access to the service.
9.02      Despite the success of ICE in the past, serious challenges lie
ahead. For example, ICE is attempting to find a delicate balance between
urban and rural development which requires increased regionalization of its
its activities. Furthermore, as the network grows in size and becomes more
sophisticated, ICE is adapting advanced technologies. Lastly, under the
difficult economic conditions currently facing the country, ICE will have to
continue to operate and plan its future investment expansion in a broader
context to take into account both the development requirements of the country
and its own financial viability.

INSTITUTO COSTARRICENSE DE ELECTRICIDAD (ICE)
LOAN 1006-CR - FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
COMPLETION REPORT
Project Provisions and Variations
A. Local Services
1.        The details of exchanges to be installed during the fourth project
as scheduled at the time of the original appraisal, and as it has finally
been carried out, is shown in Table 1 attached.
2.        As a consequence of the economic difficulties in the country in
1974 and 1975, ICE experienced for the first time in its history serious
financial constraints due to lower cash generation and higher operation
costs. To cope with the situation, ICE took several cost saving measures
including the postponement of some exchange installations by about one year:
Coronado (1,200 lines), Heredia (3,000 lines), Norte (10,000 lines), Tres
Rios (200 lines), San Jose (4,000 lines) and Santa Ana (200 lines) by 2
years. The exchanges in the provincial capitals were also delayed by 1 year,
except Liberia (300 lines). In other localities the delay in execution was
also 1 year.
3.        As the financial difficulties were overcome in 1975, ICE
experienced a heavy demand, especially in the metropolitan area. To cope
with this, ICE made some changes, basically aimed at bringing forward to 1978
some exchange installations originally planned for later: San Jose III
(4,000 lines), Sur II (phase II, 4,000 lines); San Pedro II (3,000 lines),
and increasing the size of the exchanges in provincial capitals: Alajuela
(1,500 lines), Cartago (1,200 lines), Puntarenas (500 lines), and Liberia
(300 lines). Forced to economize, ICE postponed the installation of some
small crossbar exchanges in provincial and rural localities but introduced
less costly step-by-step and manual exchanges.
4.         At the end of the fourth project, ICE has put in service 63,800
lines, 7,500 more than 56,300 lines envisaged at the time of the appraisal.
5.        As these changes were the result of unforseen financial
difficulties during 1974 and 1975 and were caused later by unexpected
increase of demand, and because the changes did not alter the basic
objectives of the project, the Bank had agreed to them during 1977 and
accepted the proposed reallocations of the proceeds of the loan, together
with the new timetable of exchange installation which stipulated that the
last part of the project was expected to be finished by the end of 1979.

6.         Transmission:  The attached Table 2/1 shows the capacities and the
number of channels of the microwave and coaxial systems at the appraisal and
the actual capacities and number of channels put in service as part of the
fourth project. Similarly, Table 2/2 compares the capacity and the channels
of the VHF and UHF systems at appraisal and as actually put in service. The
218 percent increase in the number of channels was introduced to cope with
the increase in long distance traffic which was higher than envisaged at the
time of appraisal. -
7.         Switching:  The only two changes made here were:    (a) the deletion
of two transit exchanges in Alajuela (300 lines) and Puntarenas (400 lines)
to effect economies; and (b) the increase of the interurban tandem exchange
capacity by 400 lines to 1,800 lines for increased traffic handling.

Rural Telephony
General
1.        The rural telephony development program in Costa Rica started in
the early 1960's. It was realized that communications to rural communities
were important from both economic and social viewpoints. A joint Rural
Telephony study, inspired by the Bank and realized with the joint
participation of the University of Costa Rica and the ICE, conducted during
1974 and 1975, gave more imformation about the need, usage, distribution,
cost and other relevant data. Already in December 1973, some 100 rural
public telephones existed in the country. During the appraisal of the
Fourth Telecommunications Project in December 1973, the following
objectives were agreed upon with ICE:
Rural Public Telephones:
Existing on December 31, 1973                             100
To be added during the III Project (1973-1976)            564
To be added during the IV Project (1974-1977)              90
Total at the end of the IV Project (December 1977)        754
Achievements during the Third Project
2.        ICE faced difficulties in execution of the rural development
component of the third project, mainly due to financial difficulties during
1974 and 1975. In the completion report for the third project is stated
(para 3.03): "Faced with financial difficulties (para. 5.04) which
extended from mid 1974 to the end of 1975, ICE regretfully but
realistically decided it would have to delay the provision of rural public
call offices (PCO's) which initially were expected to be unprofitable.
After the financial difficulties were resolved, ICE agreed to try and
accelerate the installation of these rural PCO's, but has not been able to
meet the initial objectives of providing services to about 600 rural
communities. In mid 1977 the program was reduced with the agreement of the
Bank to provide service to a total of 296 communities, the rest being
carried over to subsequent projects."

Achievements during the Fourth Project
3.         According to the definitions in the earlier mentioned Rural
Telephone Study in Costa Rica, the Rural public telephones are those
administered by a concessionaire and being outside the area served directly
by a telephone exchange. Applying this definition at the end of the Fourth
Project, 117 new communities were added to the 392 existing communitiesas
follows:

Comparing simply the Fourth Project target of 90 additional telephones,
with the 117 new telephones installed ICE has achieved and surpassed the
original target. However, if the carry over from the third project is
taken into account, ICE fell short of the 734 telephone target envisaged
for the end of the Fourth Project.
Broadening the coverage
4.         As a result of the many difficulties in achieving its appraisal
targets, as defined earlier, ICE had during 1980 and 1981 a fresh look at
the ultimate goals in rural telephony development. The conclusion was that
ICE must redefine not only the targets, but also the definition of the
"rural public telephone" as it was given earlier in the Rural Telephone
Study and look at rural telephones as any kind of telephone communication
given to a rural area by any technical means; i.e., open wire, radio,
cable, coin phone, phone operated by concessionaires, by manual exchanges,
etc. Similarly, there was a need to liberalize the earlier rigid boundary
division between rural, semirural, suburban and urban areas. Using this
approach, much better results were achieved, with a much wider coverage of
rural and semiurban population as originally planned. This is illustrated
in Tables 1 and 2 below which give the total number of any kind of rural
telephone by zones and by years.

The additional telephones added to the originally defined and
shown under the designation RURAL are: SUBSTITUTION - i.e., rural
communities served by a coin-operated public automatic telephone, as a
result of the integration of some rural communities or already covered by
telephone service; SEMIURBAN - many localities were converted in suburban
area and served by other means; and INDIRECT - localities originally
planned to be served as rural, are served indirectly, as an access to
public telephone is available, relatively not for.
5.        Rural exchange:   An additional improvement in the whole situation
is the fact that ICE installed in the Fourth Project some 25 small
exchanges (step-by-step or manual) instead of only one envisaged during the
appraisal.   The total installed capacity at the end of the Fourth program
was 3,530 lines opposed to 200 lines originally planned (see Table 1, Annex
1). This means a real increase in penetration in rural areas. If all
those indirectly served communities are added up, the total is 632 rural
telephones of all kinds wthich is still short by some 104 or 14% from the
original 734 target.
6.        Applying this method of diversification, ICE is hoping to achieve
a wider coverage of population by telephone services which is illustrated
by the table below:

Conclusion
7.        The rural telephone program of ICE's telecommunications which
turned out to be much more complex to execute than originally envisaged,
has brought, despite the delays, many results. ICE has, by learning
through many financial, technical and organizational difficulties, devised
a method, based on economic and social criteria, by which it can determine
the priorites in giving telephone services in rural areas with the aim of
maximizing the telephone coverage of the rural population.
ICE is now confident that it can, given adequate financial means
and sufficient time, execute efficiently any rural development program,
conceived realistically. We believe it will be proven during the Fifth
Project, at the end of which, some 1,000 rural communities will be served,
whereby about 30% of the population, living in rural areas will have access
to national telecommunications.

Return on Investment
1.        The fourth telecommunictions project financed under Bank loan
1006-CR was essentially the first half of ICE's stage IV program for NTS
expansion through 1980. The delays in the execution of the third project
(Loan 801-CR), the overlapping of the fourth and the fifth projects (Loan
1532-CR), and the new additions to the investment program not envisaged at
the time of appraisal had mixed effects on the incremental revenues and
costs, thus making all attempts at allocation somewhat arbitrary. Therefore,
the rate of return calculations have been based on the 1974-80 time slice of
NTS total investment program; this resulting rate of return is considered
representative of and proportional to the return on the project.
2. Benefit Period - The period was estimated to be from 1974 to 1993 when
the average plant addition have completed its expected life under the
assumptions of the appraisal report.
3. Net Benefits - Construction costs were obtained from ICE's records
excluding capitalized interests. Incremental revenues and operating costs
net of depreciation and interest attributed to the program were based on the
actual 1974-80 financial results. All values were expressed in 1974 prices.
Preinvestments were also taken into account in the calculation. A summary of
the costs and benefit streams is given below:

U.S.A.                             RFW./ Project perfornce report on
Costa Rica (Eburth TelecanLun-
cations Project - Loan 1006 CR)
Sir
With regard to your letter dated September 29, 1982 requesting our
comments on the Project Perfoxnance Report for Costa Rica (Fburth Teleco-
nunications Project), we wish to refer to Section 3.03, Chapter III,
Revision of the Project, which states that "as ICE gained sufficient ex-
perience in the field of rural telephone developnent, it intends to com-
plete the fifth  program revised target of having  1 000 cmnunities
connected by 1982."
tm= 1981 ICE has had to delay the execution of the rural telecomui-
OED Note:      nications program within the Fifth Project, ard we now expect to reach
See para. 3.03 the estimated target of serving 1 000 rural conamuities by the erid of
of PCR        1984. This delay was caused by the deterioration of the ecornmic situa-
tion of the country, which began in 1980, arn from then on ICE had to make
significant reductions in its  investment przgram as the annual invest-
ment budgets are subject to the approval of the Government Budgetary Au-
thority. Ihese reductions directly affected the RIaral Telephony Project
as it was not registered in the upper positions of our list or priorities.
Pdditionally, due to the problems of availability of foreign exhange,
the Covernmnt established limits on debt levels, and ICE was obliged to
delay the  rur     t of tranmnission equiEznent essential to the rural pro
gram.
At the sane time, the limitations and constraints necessary to nor-
malize and stabilize the eoncoy of the country during 1983 and 1984, in-
dicate that the tel   nications sector will have to continae reducing
rural investnts in order to adjust to the ecoonmic envirorment preva-
lent in the country, and within the franowrk of the agreenents presently
being negotiated with the International Mbnetary Fund (IF).

However, ICE is confident that it may carry out the rural develop-
nant program  to serve the 1 000 coni   ties envisaged in the Fifth Pro-
gram. rIhe equipnent and materials reede to exc:ute the greater part of
this project are either stored in our warehouses or have just been acquir-
ed, so  the physical progress of this project is to be continued for the
next two years, as foreseen.
We consiler  the  rest of the report satisfactory, as it gives a ba-
lanced conclusion of the execution of this project, and we wish to express
you our gratitude for the favorable comments on our organization.
Sircerely yours,
