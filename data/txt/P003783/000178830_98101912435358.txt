1.  THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY SECTORS
Energy Resources and Status of Development
1.01      Indonesia is well endowed with several energy resources - petroleum,
natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and geothermal. Prior to independence
the country relied on coal and hydroelectric energy to a large extent for its
commercial energy, but later shifted to petroleum which now accounts for 90%
of total commercial energy consumption (para. 1.15).
Petroleum
1.02      Proved petroleum reserves are estimated at about 15 billion barrels.
The figure has not increased significantly since 1970. Present production is
about 1.6 million barrels per day, and it is expected to increase to 1.8 mil-
lion barrels per day in five years. The current government assessment is
that with virtually static reserves and production, and rapid increases in
domestic demand (about 14% per year), surpluses available for export would
steadily decline, with the possibility that Indonesia could become a net
importer of oil. This would seriously undermine the economy. A shift to more
abundantly available coal and natural gas is therefore a basic policy objective.
Natural Gas
1.03      The estimated natural gas reserve is about 34 trillion cu ft,
of which 5 trillion cu ft represents gas associated with oil production.
The present production level is about 800 billion cu ft per year, less than
half of which is consumed. Gas pipelines have recently been laid to steel
and fertilizer factories and consumption is expected to increase at the rate
of 15% per year during the next five years. Following agreements reached
with Japan a few years ago, export of natural gas in the liquid form (LNG)
has commenced and is expected to grow rapidly in coming years. The national
planning agency (BAPPENAS) has agreed to a study of pricing of natural gas.
Government is in the process of hiring a Consultant, approved by the Bank,
who will periodically monitor the work.
Coal
1.04      Indonesia's coal reserves are conservatively estimated at 1.2 bil-
lion tons - 86% of which are in Sumatra and the balance in Kalinantan.  Some
estimates place the total reserves at 10.0 billion tons. Actual production
was as high as 2.0 million tons per year in 1940, but declined thereafter and
stood at barely 140,000 tons in 1973. Rehabilitation measures increnased
production to 250,000 tons last year. Of this, 150,000 tons came from the
Bukit Asam collieries and 100,000 tons from the Ombilin mines - both in
Sumatra. Further increases in output require large investments both for
mining and transport.



1.05      In recent years government encouraged private concessionaires to
survey reserves and arrange for large scale exports of coal. One large
concession in South Sumatra has been given up by Shell Mijnbouw, but other
concessions are under discussion for developing Kalimantan deposits. Recog-
nizing that the trade value of coal would be substantially lower than that of
oil, the government decided in 1976 that it would actively encourage develop-
ment of coal for local consumption wherever it was technically and economically
feasible. The electricity sector represents the largest potential market. Of
the known coal deposits, those at Bukit Asam are considered the best prospect
for early development. Drilling carried out last year has confirmed that the
proved recoverable reserves at Bukit Asam are at least 100 million tons.
1.06      In 1978, the Bank made an engineering loan (S-9) to the government
of Indonesia of US$10.0 million mainly to finance consultants services needed
to confirm the economic viability and determine the optimal features of an
integrated coal mining and transportation project to utilize about 2.5 mil-
lion tons of Bukit Asam coal annually at a major thermal power station site
at Suralaya on the west coast of Java. This would be adequate for an 800 MW
installation. A consultant has been appointed. By May 1979, studies of
alternative schemes of coal mining and transport would be sufficiently
advanced to determine the most likely price of coal delivered at Suralaya.
Government has also sought Bank assistance to implement the project. A
decision on its appraisal will be taken by mid 1979. A high level steering
committee, representing senior representatives of concerned ministries, has
been formed. It will oversee and guide the work of a full time project
management group set up to coordinate the engineering of this integrated
project and to represent the interests of the various operating entities -
mining, railways, shipping and electricity supply - who would ultimately be
involved in the project.
1.07      The cost at which Bukit Asam coal is currently sold is about
US$11.0 per ton, but it does not cover the national coal entity (BATUBARA's)
costs. The breakeven cost at which coal delivered to West Java would be
competitive with oil for electricity production is estimated at about
US$37.0 per ton when the price of oil is US$13.6 per barrel. It is expected
that large scale mining at Bukit Asam using modern methods and effectively
organized transport, would result in costs which are both profitable to
BATUBARA and below the breakeven cost of fuel oil for economic electricity
production. Government has therefore decided that all future thermal power
stations in Java including the proposed project should be designed to use coal
as the primary fuel.
1.08      The studies underway (para 1.06) will review the available data on
coal reserves to enable plans to be drawn up to mine and utilize about 3.0 mil-
lion tons of coal per year and transport infrastructure to support about 6 mil-
lion tons per year. Government has also agreed to carry out a study of pricing
of coal in relation to other sources of energy so that these can be set to
serve the best interests of the country and enable the concerned entities to
operate on a commercially sound basis. The Bank has drawn up terms of reference
for these studies and will render assistance as appropriate.

Hydroelectric Resources
1.09      The hydroelectric potential of the country has been estimated at
about 31,000 MW distributed as follows: Irian Jaya 9,000 MW, Kalimantan 7,000
MW, Sumatra 6,750 MW, Sulawesi 5,600 MW and Java 2,500 MW.  These are rough
estimates of the theoretical potential. There are no reliable estimates of
the proportion that can be actually developed. Reconnaissance and preliminary
studies (mostly the former) have been carried out of sites where an aggregate
installed capacity of about 15,000 MW is believed technically feasible but
little is known about the costs of development of these sites. The greatest
potential is in Irian Jaya where demand is smallest, and Java where the demand
is greatest has the least.
1.10      The total installed hydroelectric generating capacity in the
country is 621 MW - of which 418 MW is in Java, 174 MW in Sulawesi and the
balance in Kalimantan (20 MW) and Sumatra (8 MW). Construction of a major
hydroelectric project has just commenced at Asahan (600 MW) in Sumatra as
part of a large aluminum complex. It will have a capacity of 225,000 tons of
aluminum per year. About 50 MW will be available for PLN's grid use.
1.11      Two hydroelectric sites, Saguling (700 MW) in West Java and Mrica
(180 MW) in Central Java are in the stage of detailed field investigations,
assisted by Japanese and Russian agencies respectively. These projects are
included in the national electricity entity, Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara
(PLN)'s development program and are expected to be completed by 1986/87. A
few small hydroelectric schemes, mostly for producing secondary energy in
conjunction with irrigation projects, are also included in this program. PLN
has forwarded proposals to BAPPENAS for detailed field investigations of
schemes with a total capacity of 4000 MW and for reconnaissance of sites with
an estimated total capacity of 6000 MW, during REPELITA /1 III.
1.12      Although static reserves of petroleum and the cost of energy
from new coal fired thermal stations place a high premium on development of
hydro resources, unfavorable location of potential sites from the main demand
centers, the non-dependable capacity of projects associated with development
of irrigation, and long gestation periods, place limits on practical develop-
ment in the near future. However, the pace of investigation needs to be
expedited. A comprehensive program - rather than the present piecemeal
approach of depending on separate financing agencies for each site - is
needed. PLN agreed during appraisal to review the program, in consultation
with BAPPENAS, and indicate what assistance might be needed from the Bank in
this regard. It'could be considered during the next power loan (the ninth)
in Bank FY80.
Geothermal Resources
1.13      With a large part of the country exposed to volcanic activity,
Indonesia has substantial potential in the form of geothermal energy. It has
/1 Five Year Development Plan (1979/80 - 1983/84).



- 4 -
been estimated that these could sustain about 900 MW of generating capacity.
The sites are relatively close to the main habitation centers in Java and
Sulawesi. A 30 MW pilot geothermal project expected to be in operation
by 1982 is being set up at Kamojung (West Java) in collaboration with New
Zealand. If it proves to be successful it could lead to commercial develop-
ment of an important new energy source, particularly for Java.
Nuclear Power
1.14      Studies carried out by the International Atomic Energy Authority
(IAEA) in 1976 concluded that a nuclear power station would be justified in
Java by the mid-eighties. Concurrent Java system studies by Preece, Cardew
and Rider (PCR) of the UK (paras 1.35 and 2.14) using updated higher costs
indicated that it would not be justified until the mid-nineties. An indepen-
dent Bank study /1 in 1978 using updated construction and fuel costs confirmed
the latter result. PLN's investment program, and long-term plans, do not
provide for a nuclear power station until after the mid-nineties but PLN is
cooperating with the Atomic Energy Authority's continuing studies of the
economics of nuclear power in the country.
Growth of Energy Consumption
1.15      Commercial energy consumption in Indonesia grew by an average of
about 5% per year between 1963 and 1970, but at an average of 14% per year
thereafter reflecting the growth of the economy. The recent relatively high
rates of growth of commercial energy consumption require a study of pricing,
noncommercial fuel consumption and substitution trends. The table below
summarizes the growth by source. Petroleum accounted for 90% of total
commercial energy consumption during 1977.

Organization of the Energy Sector
1.16      In May 1978, the Ministry of ttines and Energy was established during
a general reorganization of government departments, to effectively coordinate
all activities in the energy sector. This ministry now has overall responsi-
bility for general mining, coal, oil, natural gas and electricity. It controls
several state enterprises such as the national oil and gas entity (PERTArIINA),
BATUBARA (coal), and PLN (electricity). Tne organization of this new ministry
is shown in Annex 1.
Energy Policy
1.17      The country does not yet have a clearly formulated overall energy
policy based on detailed demand projections, examination of all its resource
endowments and costs of alternative development strategies, and pricing.
This will require a good deal more information than is presently available.
However, the latest moves of the government away from petroleum sources
towards the use of coal for electricity generation is clearly a step in the
right direction. Meaningful relative energy prices will not however be
realized until the Government fully adjusts domestic oil prices which are
controlled and subsidized by the Government. The Bank had urged the Government
to gradually phase out domestic oil price subsidies. Prior to the 1978
devaluation, the economic subsidy on fuel products amounted to about one third
of their opportunity cost. The subsidized products were kerosene, diesel and
fuel oil which together account for about 80% of total consumption. Devalua-
tion increased the rupiah costs of crude and imported products such as kerosene
and prices of all petroleum products include subsidies. In order to reduce
these subsidies the Government has recently (April/May 1979) increased
domestic prices of oil products by an average of 40%. Following these price
increases, the level of subsidies is now estimated to amount to
Rp 419.6 billion ($670 million), compared to Rp 612.5 billion ($980 million)
before.
1.18       During appraisal, introduction of a price differential between
residual fuel (used for PLN's large steam power sL.;L;) and diesel oil
(used by smaller, mostly private, captive plants) was suggested as the
prices per unit of heat value of these petroleum products are rouglhly equal,
which is unsound. Neither do fuel prices reflect such commercial factors as
the present large market PLN provides to PERTAMINA at few supply points
thereby reducing its costs of supply. Prevailing fuel prices contribute to
some extent to the unusually large proportion of small, uneconomic, electri-
city generating plants found in Indonesia (paras. 1.23 and 1.24). The
various subsectoral pricing studies (paras. 1.03, 1.08) and the ongoing work
of evolving a cost-reflecting tariff structure for electricity, which the
Bank is assisting (paras. 1.42-1.43), when completed, should help in evolving
pricing strategies for energy which are more rationally based and also serve
the national interest.

The Electricity Sector
Background
1.19      The electricity sector in Indonesia comprises PLN - the government-
owned enterprise statutorily responsible for all generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity in the country - captive /1 plant installations
and some municipal franchises. Although PLN's history goes back to 1961 when
three Dutch-owned electric utility companies in Java were nationalized by
Government, its effective growth started only after 1972 when its charter
(para. 2.01) laid down its legal status and set out its comprehensive duties
(paras. 2.03/2.04) and adequate foreign financing became available. Due to
historical neglect, PLN was unable until about 1976 to meet the existing
demand and the backlog with any reliability and its operations were small and
dispersed. The period was characterized by rapid growth of captive plants
which filled the vacuum. It is estimated that the aggregate capacity of
captive plant now equals that of PLN. PLN is now ready to fulfill its respon-
sibilities as the main source of electricity supply. A review of the electri-
city sector, covering both PLN and captive plant, is appropriate at this time
and has been carried out by PLN and the Bank (paras. 1.20, 1.23-1.30).
1.20      Until the early seventies, sector development was severely constrained
because foreign financing was not available. Despite greater progress in
recent years per capita consumption is still extremely low at about 45 kWh
during 1977/78./2 Due to PLN's inability to meet the total demand, many
industries and individuals installed their own plant. These captive power
installations now aggregate to about half the total generating capacity in
the country - though in terms of energy production they account for only
about a third of the consumption. They mainly comprise small diesel plants
in urban areas which are expensive to operate and constitute a drain on the
country's petroleum resources. Exceptions are the recently completed 165 MW
Larona hydroelectric station in Sulawesi, and the 320 MIW steam power station
expected to be commissioned this year at Krakatau Steel Works (West Java).
Elimination of such uneconomic investments in small diesel installations can
be achieved only when the PLN system is expanded adequately and provides
reliable supplies./3 This requires substantial and sustained investments and
is unlikely to be fully achieved for some time. Government supports PLN's
program for rationalization and expansion of electricity supply.
Existing Public Supply Facilities
1.21      The total generating capacity available to PLN /4 at the end of
FY78 was about 2,000 IIW, 40% of which was in the form of gas turbines, 23%
diesel, 22% hydro and 15% steam.  In Java, gas turbines now account for 50% of
/1  Installed by private parties for electricity production for their own use.
/2  In comparison, Malaysia had 450 kWh, Papua New Guinea 300 kWh, Philippines
250 kWh and Thailand 180 kWh.
/3  PLN will have to continue with some diesel installations outside Java where
demand is insufficient to justify minimum size steam stations (para. 3.03).
/4  Includes the 125 MW hydroelectric station owned by the Jatiluhur Authority.



-7 -
the total of 1,255 MW. This unbalanced development of generating capacity was
due to a crash program of gas turbine installations in the early seventies
when   PLN suffered major breakdowns in generating capacity and gas turbines
were seen as the only means of adding new generating capacity quickly. It is
being corrected now with the commissioning in 1979 of new steam generating
capacity at Iarak and Gresik (East Java), Semarang (Central Java) and Muara-
Karang (West Java). These new steam stations will add 1,200 MW of base load
capacity by 1982. At that time, the PLN system in Java will have 53% of
steam, 20% of hydro and 27% of gas turbine plant; all PLN's uneconomic small
diesel plant would be retired. The proportion of steam, hydro, gas turbines
and diesel in the entire country would be 41%, 18%, 20% and 21% respectively.
1.22      PLN operates about 3800 km of transmission lines, mostly in Java.
About 2000 km of high voltage (70/150 kV) transmission lines are currently
under construction and these will be completed during 1979-82. The attached
map no. 12435 R2 shows the existing 150 kV system and extensions in progress
in Java. The presently isolated systems of West, Central and East Java will
be interconnected in 1980 to form an all Java grid. In addition to its main
transmission lines, PLN now has in operation distribution systems aggregating
some 40,000 km.
Captive Power Installations
1.23      In the absence of a strong electricity sector, growth of captive
power installations in the past was uncoordinated and haphazard (para. 1.19).
There was little regulation. PLN's charter (1972) introduced a semblance of
control but the regulations framed merely required licensing of operation (not
construction) and registration of these facilities; no penalties were imposed.
The Coordinating Board of Capital Investment (BKPM), which controls the
import of such plant, never consulted PLN before giving its approval. Presently,
PLN licenses operation only of those industries/agencies that report to it
for registration. Generators less than 2 kVA are excluded from licensing/
registration by the regulations in force. The result is that reliable data
on growth and characteristics of non-PLN supplies is not available.
1.24      During 1978, as part of a study of the causes that led to the
proliferation of such installations and the implications of recent trends
in growth of captive generating capacity PLN started field surveys and
collection of information on the capacities, dates of installation, demand,
energy production and other operating data of captive plants. These are
summarized in Annexes 2 and 3 attached. The data is not complete and PLN is
continuing the effort.
1.25      Available data (Annex 2) indicates that there was little growth
of captive plant during 1977, though the growth up to 1976 was substantial.
PLN reports that the declining trend continued in 1978. It is relevant to
note that the major schemes PLN launched in Java to rehabilitate its distri-
bution systems and expand them so as to provide adequate and reliable supplies,
became operational around 1976. It is apparent from the observed growth
trends that in those areas where growth of reliable public supply has been
assured in recent years, and PLN's connection charges were lowered (para.
1.27) the growth of these small captive installations has been virtually



arrested. The recent economic downturn could have also contributed to this
result. New consumers with an aggregate demand of over 1500 MVA have registered
with PLN for connection during 1979-84 reflecting the significant change in
PLN's public image. If new industries insist on penalty clauses for delays in
supply by PLN, these are being introduced into PLN's supply contracts; again,
reflecting PLN's improved confidence in its ability to meet deadlines.
1.26      Annex 3 shows the actual energy production during 1977 and other
statistical operational data of captive power installations. The average
station plant factor is about 25%. Excluding continuous operations where
captive plants have been installed at fertilizer, cement and paper factories,
the average utilization is even lower at about 18%. This low utilization
reflects mainly the inherently low load factors of small isolated loads and
inadequate maintenance of such plant. At such poor levels of effective
utilization captive plants are very expensive to run and would not generally
be able to compete with public supply.
1.27      PLN's tariff includes: (a) a heavy connection charge and (b) the
normal demand and energy charges. Until FY77, PLN levied an average con-
nection charge of Rp 120 per VA (US$290 per kVA) for medium/large consumers
which at that time represented almost as large an outlay as that required to
install a diesel plant. It was a prohibitively large connection fee which
forced many industries to install their own plant - particularly when public
supply had also become notoriously unreliable - as in the early seventies.
PLN's tariff policy could be understood in the prevailing circumstances.
Following recent improvements in its supply facilities, PLN reduced its
average connection charge to Rp 85 per VA during its FY78 and to Rp 50 per VA
in FY79. The consequent spurt in demand has contributed to PLN's sales
increase of 26% this year. Further reductions in connection charges are under
consideration, along with other measures as PLN moves to increase its sales in
step with increases in generating capacity expected during the next few years.
1.28      During 1978, PLN addressed the chairman of BKPM to require that
investors who are considering installation of captive plants contact PLN
initially before deciding on using their own electric supply, so that non-
optimal investments are avoided and the country's foreign exchange could
be conserved. BKPM has since instituted appropriate procedures for consulta-
tion with PLN and proper control is now being exercised to prevent avoidable
growth of uneconomic captive plants.
1.29      Nonavailabilty of reliable public supply and PLN's prohibitively
high connection charges (since reduced) as a precondition to public supply,
are the two main reasons for the unusually large proportion of captive power
installations found in Indonesia today. The unsatisfied demand is large and
PLN's supply systems are still in the early stages of development. Some
demands, particularly in outlying regions, would therefore continue to have to
be met by existing captive plant and possibily even new installations.
However, it is clear that, in Java, the growth of captive generation has been
arrested by expansion of reliable public supply and its future growth will not



- 9 -
be significant. Outside Java, there may be continued justification for some
time for captive installations in view of several factors - the geographically
dispersed market, status of development of public supplies, and the fact that
PLN itself relies to a large extent on similar small size diesel installations
for supply to these isolated areas. Where PLN's expansion is based on develop-
ment of coal, hydroelectric power and surplus natural gas, the case for
expansion of captive diesel installations would be weaker, as in Java.
1.30      PLN's capacity expansion plans, particularly in Java, are based
on tight reserve margins (para. 5.01). The existing diesel captive installa-
tions with any economic life left will therefore continue to be utilized by
their owners as emergency standby or for use during peak periods when there
are restrictions on supply. Captive power installations in Java, with a few
exceptions, are too small to be interconnected with the PLN system; their
utilization will therefore continue to be poor. To a limited extent they can
be taken over by PLN where the equipment is in satisfactory condition, for use
in isolated areas where public supply has to be introduced. The age of these
installations and difficulties in obtaining spares would however be deterring
factors. It is obvious that such equipment as can be advantageously used
should not be left redundant when the sector needs it. PLN's agrees with this
approach and its tariff policy will be developed to permit this. PLN's
connection policy for consumers with existing captive plants is to consider
cases on their merits, as the situation is not amenable to generalization.
Access to Service
1.31      Indonesia's population has low access to electricity when compared
to other countries. About 6% of the households were connected at end FY77
compared to 27% in Thailand and 32% in the Philippines. Regional imbalances
exist as shown by the degrees of electrification in the regions given below
(see also paras. 1.38-1.41).
Table 1.2: DOMESTIC CONNECTIONS

Rural Electrification
1.32      Rural electrification (RE) has been undertaken in a small way from
funds provided to PLN by the government. An RE division was formed in 1976 in
PLN to promote RE projects and the division has several projects in view.
1.33      The Cooperatives Department with assistance from USAID has formed
three pilot cooperatives to test RE on the US/Philippines basis.  The works
are currently under construction.
1.34      The RE program should be carefully evaluated as substantial sub-
sidies will be needed in the early years until load builds up; the public
power sector is not sufficiently developed to be able to cross-subsidize
rural electrification within the tariff structure at acceptable levels, as
has happened in Korea and Taiwan and is now happening in Thailand. The
government would need to provide the local funds necessary for construction
and subsidize operating deficits until village loads grow to an extent that
they cover operating costs and meet the relevant debt service.
The Power Market
1.35      Several attempts have been made in recent years to prepare a usable
demand forecast for Indonesia. This has been difficult because of low
consumption levels and the background of public power supply which covered a
fraction of the total market. Furthermore, the severe restrictions on PLN's
ability to provide supply, including financial, management and technical
constraints, made PLN's past record of sales an exceedingly unreliable base
for future projections. In 1973, a consultant, Chas. T. Main of the USA
applied an indirect method of using growth probabilities in selected sensitive
economic sectors and their probable impact on other sectors. A more direct
detailed assessment of the underlying demand /1 in Java was made during
1974-76 by PCR of the UK as a part of the Bank financed comprehensive Java
System Development Study (Credit 399-IND). This study quantified the effects
of restrictions on supply during peak hours, low voltage, self-generation and
PLN's waiting lists. There have been no similar comprehensive demand surveys
for the other islands.
1.36      Realizing that PLN's sales would not immediately rise to the levels
of the underlying demand estimated by PCR in Java and that a certain portion
of this market will continue to be met by captive installations for some time,
PCR also determined what it considered realistic targets of sales on which PLN
could base its future development program. These are substantially lower than
the underlying high market forecast, but of the same order of magnitude as
/1 The demand PLN would have served if its installations had been adequate
and all self-supplied installations had been served by PLN.



- 11 -
an independent macro estimate which used per capita GNP projections /1.
These studies show that PLN's future sales, in the short and medium term,
will depend entirely on the rate at which PLN is capable of satisfying an
increasing proportion of the existing demand whereas, in the long term,
sales are expected to reflect more closely the growth of the power market
based on the overall level of economic development.
1.37      In 1976, PLN and the Bank accepted the PCR low forecast as a
reasonable basis for planning PLN's long-term development program (para.
2.14). Based on this, a comprehensive, optimized program of generation and
transmission expansion was pr'epared by PCR. It was felt, however, that this
program should be jointly reviewed by PLN and the Bank and modified annually
to ensure that in the short and medium term, it is consistent with PLN's
actual development of generation, transmission and distribution facilities,
and with the growth of sales. The latest such forecast of PLN's sales, made
in August 1977, is indicated in Annex 4. It is about 20% lower than PCR's
low forecast for 1983 but catches up with it by about 1990. Accordingly,
growth rates between 1979-1983 are expected to be about 21% per year while
PLN increases its share of the total market from about 50% to about 80%;
thereafter growth is expected to gradually decline to about 15% per year.
The latest indications are that the actual demand will in fact be higher than
these estimates and they will need review in due course. During FY79 PLN's
sales increased by about 26%.
PLN's Load Growth and Consumer Connection Program
1.38      PLN has recently developed and is now actively implementing a
connection program consistent with its improved capability as would be seen
from the results given on Table 1.3 below. Figures in parentheses indicate
growth over the previous year.
Table 1.3: GROW4TH OF PLN'S CONSUMERS

- 12 -
1.39      PLN exceeded the consumer connection program target (16.2%) in
FY78 and progress during the first half of FY79 was even higher. The
growth in PLN's sales in 1977-78 was 14.6% against the target of 17% but
better than 10.1% of the previous year. The acceleration in the consumer
connection program will be reflected in the sales of 1978-79; sales in FY79
are expected to increase by 26% over FY78.
1.40      There has been a noticeable shift from the pattern of PLN's sales
also in recent years. At the start of REPELITA II in 1974, industry accounted
for only about 25% of the PLN's sales. It now accounts for about 35%. It is
expected that by the end of REPELITA III, the share of industry would be about
half, making PLN's operations more balanced, with better commercial prospects
and contributing in a greater measure to employment creation - an important
economic objective of the country.
Tariff Structure
1.41      PLN's basic tariff was based on a 1972 study carried out by SOFRELEC
using estimated short-run marginal costs. It was introduced by Government
decree in June 1973. Subsequently, surcharges were introduced which increased
the average level by about 100%. For administrative reasons the surcharges
were applied only to the energy (kWh) charges and not to the demand (kW).
1.42      During discussions of Loan 1513-IND (Power Seven Project) agreement
was reached that PLN would design a new tariff structure to become effective
not later than April 1, 1979 and that the Bank would assist PLN in this
regard. A covenant in the project agreement requires that the new tariff
structure will reflect long run marginal costs to the Indonesian economy of
meeting the demand for electricity as closely as possible.
1.43      The studies have now been substantially completed and a tariff
structure based on the long run marginal costs of supply will be implemented
at the time of the next increase in tariff levels which is expected before
March 31, 1980. It was therefore agreed during negotiations to postpone the
date of introduction of the new tariff structure to March 31, 1980.
1.44      Tariff structures require review frequently (preferably annually)
to reflect the changing long run marginal costs occasioned by changes in the
policy, the development programs and the demand forecasts on which the costs
are based. In order to maximize the assistance already given to PLN by Bank
staff, the Bank will continue its dialogue on tariffs with Government and PLN
and provide any assistance that may be required.

2. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
2.01      The beneficiary would be the PLN, the National Electricity Author-
ity. Its current charter to operate is the 1972 Presidential Decree No. 18
(para. 1.19). It was aimed at changing the status of PLN from a department
of the erstwhile Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power (when it was
controlled by the Director-General of the Ministry and responsibilities were
ill defined; in fact, limited to day to day operations) to an autonomous
unit. The Directorate-General was abolished in 1972. The chaotic situation
of public electricity supply when Bank operations commenced in 1969 gradually
changed, and there was remarkable progress in PLN's management. PLN grew in
stature and has greatly improved its public image in recent years; it now
promises to become an effective agency which could develop into a strong
commercially oriented public utility within a few years.
2.02      After the reorganization of the government in May 1978, and establish-
ment of the new Ministry of Mines and Energy, the post of Directorate General
of Electric Power has been revived to oversee PLN's functioning (para. 1.16)
and the directorate has been strengthened. Steps are being taken to amend
PLN's charter, transferring back to government the functions of planning and
licensing. Government is also considering options of dividing the exclusive
functions of PLN among other agencies yet to be formed. These changes are
ostensibly to remove administrative anomalies in the new Ministry but they
could have far reaching implications, especially considering the past back-
ground. Covenants under earlier power loans require that no material changes
would be made in PLN's statute without the Bank's prior concurrence. Attention
of the government has been drawn to this requirement and the Ministry of
Mines and Energy will consult the Bank before substantial changes in PLN's
charter are made. The Ministry has also informed the Bank that government
appreciates the rapid institutional progress PLN has made and that any
changes made would preserve its preeminent role.
Legal Status and Responsibilities
2.03      PLN is an autonomous public enterprise (Perum) and carries out its
objectives within the national development program in accordance with Govern-
ment policies. In practice, the minister determines its policy and exercises
overall control of its activities. He is assisted by an advisory board consist-
ing of the Ministers of Finance, Industry, and the Chairman of the National
Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) in making decisions on important matters.
2.04      PLN is statutorily responsible for the construction and operation
of all power facilities throughout the country, preparing power development
plans, regulations on standardization, safety and licensing of operation
of captive plant, and entering into contracts for purchase or sale of elec-
tricity. PLN's investment plans and tariffs are subject to government



- 14 -
approval. Its bid evaluations and proposals for placing contracts for goods,
services and works are also subject to government approval. PLN is responsible
for research activities in the field of electric power and for organizing
personnel training.
Organization
2.05      PLN is organized and functions as a modern public utility with a
fair degree of autonomy. The board is statutorily bound to have a President
Director and at least two other directors. Government has agreed with the
Bank that it will ensure that the position of President Director of PLN shall
at all times be filled by a qualified experienced person. Currently, the
board comprises the President Director and five others; all are executive
directors and each heads a department in the head office - planning, opera-
tions, construction, finance and administration. In the field there are 15
regional or wilayah offices with a total of about 100 branches. Regions are
responsible for minor construction and the construction department is respon-
sible for all major project construction. The organization chart is shown in
Annex 5.
Management
2.06      PLN now has the potential for developing into a well organized
utility continually improving its procedures and operations. Planning in
Java is now well established for generation. Transmission and distribution
planning in Java and overall planning has also improved and results should
become apparent during the next few years. In view of the geographical
features of the country, the wilayahs (regions) should have greater involve-
ment in long term planning and responsibility for achievement of PLN's goals.
The process will take time. PLN is taking steps to train regional staff in
planning and financial management. After the training is completed and the
regions have prepared long-term plans and financial forecasts, PLN intends to
set performance targets for each region.
Manpower and Training
2.07      PLN now has a total staff of about 28,000 persons out of which
about 18,000 are on the permanent payroll. About 3,800 are engaged on
construction. Out of the total employees about 830 are university graduates
(4.7%) and 6,300 (35%) high school graduates. There has been a steady
improvement in the percentages of these personnel over the years and a
reduction in the percentage of lower grade personnel, which is a trend in the
right direction. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining high quality
technical manpower, PLN is sponsoring over 100 scholarships in the technical
universities in the country.



- 15 -
2.08      PLN operates six in-service training schools at Cibogo, Slipi,
Ancol, Tanjung Priok, Pandan and Medan. In 1978-79 over 1,100 PLN personnel
will undergo training in these centers in different disciplines. Also about
50 PLN staff will be sent abroad for advanced training during the year. About
6% of all the staff will be exposed to some training program. PLN has a
manpower development plan which forecasts the number and quality of staff
needed and it is endeavoring to recruit and train staff subject to the known
limitations of the country's educational system.
2.09      PLN still does not have advanced training facilities for operation
and maintenance staff for steam power stations. About 40 persons were
trained in the USA with the assistance of Black and Veatch International
(BVI), the Project Consultants, for the Muara Karang steam station.  BVI have
expressed a high opinion of the caliber of these persons. As a long-term
policy it is necessary to set up a thermal station training school with more
sophisticated facilities such as a training simulator. Provision is being
made in the power project for such a training center. (paras. 3.13, 3.15).
Research
2.10      PLN has set up a power research institute with a high voltage
laboratory expected to be in service in 1979.
Accounting and Audit
2.11      Accounting is based on a system introduced by consultants (SOFRELEC)
in the early 1970s and is generally well operated. Because of the relatively
short period of operating experience of the system, certain areas still
require improvement. The system is based on two sets of books - operations
and construction, with separate annual accounts being made up for each and
then consolidated at head office.
2.12      The Directorate General of State Financial Supervision has been,
accepted by the Bank as PLN's auditors. PLN has also employed S.A. Parmar
(the Indonesian associates of Cooper's and Lybrand, Australian international
accountants) on a one time basis to carry out an audit for FY79 so that PLN
and the Bank can benefit from the views of a commercial auditor.
Insurance
2.13      PLN takes out insurance only for those areas such as motor vehicles,
that it is statutorily obliged to cover and for transit and marine insurance
on equipment and materials being transported. Fire and other hazards are
self insured. In view of the geographical spread of PLN's assets any loss
would be insignificant compared to overall assets and operations; this
procedure is therefore considered satisfactory.

Performance Under Earlier Bank Operations
2.14      In the past the Bank has provided funds totalling US$461 million for
a balanced power generation/distribution program in Jakarta, West and Central
Java areas.  Three distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334, and Loan
1259-IND) for the rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution facilities
in the greater Jakarta area and four power generation projects (Credit 399,
and Loans 1127, 1365-IND and 1513-IND) for West Java and Central Java
were undertaken to help PLN in commencing the necessary modernization pro-
grams. The past loans and credits also provided funds for a number of
consulting services such as the large management consulting effort of SOFRELEC,
the Java System Development Study undertaken by PCR, feasibility studies of
the 1,400 MW Saguling hydroelectric project, the West Java dual fired (coal
and oil) thermal power project (Suralaya, presently under consideration for
Bank financing), the study for a Java Extra High Voltage (EHV) Interconnection,
and a feasibility study for a coal-fired thermal power project in East
Java.
2.15      PLN's performance in implementing the above projects has been
uneven. The earlier distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334-IND) were
completed about two years behind schedule. A completion report on these two
integrated projects has been prepared and is being reviewed by the Bank's
operations evaluation department (OED). PLN's overall inexperience in
project implementation in the early stages of the projects was as much to
blame for the delay as was the lack of coordination between the government,
(more specifically the city planning department of the municipality of
Jakarta), and PLN which made it virtually impossible for the consultants to
design a distribution project for implementation in time. Similarly, cons-
truction of the first three 100 MW units at the Muara Karang thermal station
(Credit 399 and Loan 1127-IND) has fallen behind schedule by about two years.
The first and second generating units have recently been synchronized (January/
March 1979) and are undergoing commissioning tests. PLN's performance has
significantly improved and the third unit is expected to be commissioned well
ahead of the contract date. Construction of the fourth and fifth units is on
schedule. Cost overruns resulting from the oil price increase and consequent
time-consuming problems in raising the necessary additional funds, a pre-
requisite for PLN to be able to let the affected supply contracts, were the
main reasons for the delay. Procurement delays, particularly in issuing
letters of credit, following new government procedures introduced in 1976
continue to hamper implementation of projects. This requires streamlining
(see para. 3.29) and will be reviewed by the Government and the Bank.

3.  THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
PLN's Development Program
3.01      PLN has prepared a development plan for power in Indonesia for the
period up to 1986/87, which envisages an increase in the installed generating
capacity from about 2,000 MW to over 7,300 MW enabling energy generating
capability to increase from 4,800 GWH to about 25,000 GWH. It also provides
for the development of associated transmission and distribution networks,
including an EHV system for Java and 150 kV submarine interconnections between
Java, Bali and the Madura islands. The total investments at 1978 constant
prices amount to about US$9.0 billion with a foreign exchange component of
US$6.1 billion. The expenditure is phased over a nine-year period, increasing
from US$0.65 billion in 1978/79 to about US$1.50 billion in 1986/87. Govern-
ment considers the investment program realistic and intends to make appropriate
provisions in REPELITA III currently under preparation.
3.02      The investment program covers the country basically in two geo-
graphically divided areas viz (a) Java Island and (b) territories outside
Java. About 85 million out of the population total of about 135 million
(63%) live in Java, which, in 1977/78, accounted for 3,900 GWh, or about 81%
of the country's total energy generation of 4,800 GWh. Out of total gener-
ating capacity of about 2,000 tW installed by PLN in the country, approx-
imately 1,295 MW was in Java (65.1%). The territories outside Java cover a
large number of islands, the major ones being Sumatra, Kalimantan and
Sulawesi. These three islands together with Java account for over 95% of the
electricity consumption in the country.
3.03      Detailed engineering studies have been carried out to identify the
optimal development strategy for the power system in Java and the least cost
path has been identified. The plan has been formulated to achieve the
following objectives viz (a) optimize resource utilization by substituting
use of oil by coal, hydro and geothermal resources for power generation and
by replacing/reducing use of fuel inefficient installations; (b) realize
economies of scale by larger sized installations; (c) achieve operational
economy by coordinated utilization of plants through interconnected opera-
tions; and (d) provide acceptable standards of reliability of supply. The
development plan for areas outside Java requires further review as except in
a few areas, e.g. Sulawesi and Bali the demand forecasts are not based on
detailed surveys and generation planning is not oriented to utilize indigenous
energy resources. There appears to be an excessive reliance on diesel
installations, and utilization targets planned are low. During appraisal PLN
agreed to review the investment plan outside Java. In particular PLlI will
(a) identify all the reasons for the present low utilization of existing
plant and continued low utilization trends in the investment plans and (b)
arrange for optimum utilization of all facilities existing and under
construction.

3.06      The program of expansion of generating capacity in Java is sum-
marized in Annex 6. The expansion of the transmission and distribution
networks covers about 2,500 circuit km of EHV lines, 13,000 circuit km of
150 kV and 70 kV transmission lines, 10,000 MVA of substation capacity,
100,000 circuit km of primary and low voltage lines and 10,000 IIVA of
distribution transformers.
THE PROJECT
3.07      The project comprises the installation by January 1984 of the first
400 MW thermal generating set (Unit I) for using both coal and oil as fuel,
training and other consultancy services. It represents the first of two
phases of the first stage of the Suralaya power scheme which envisages instal-
lation of two 400 M1W generating units by January 1985 to utilize planned
production of about 2.5 million tons at Bukit Asam (para. 1.06). The Suralaya
scheme has been subdivided to reduce annual financing commitments.
Origin of the Suralaya Scheme
3.08      The Suralaya scheme was identified by the comprehensive Java
Development Study financed through Cr 399-IND and carried out by PCR of
the U.K. It will ultimately have an installed capacity of 3,100 MW./I The
Suralaya site was chosen by PLN and confirmed by the consultant, MONENCO of
Canada, after the project feasibility study for which Loan 1127-IND provided
financing. The choice of site for this major coal burning station is
appropriate. The first stage and its associated EHV project (para. 3.10)
together account for about 8% of PLN's 1979-85 development program.
3.09      The first stage comprises site development and the supply, install-
ation and commissioning of:
(i) two dual-fired (coal and oil) reheat type, steam generat-
ing units, nominally rated at 400 MW each;
/1 Four units of 400 MW and three units of 500 MW.



- 20 -
(ii)  oil handling and storage facilities;
(iii) coal receiving, handling and storage facilities;
(iv) ash-disposal facilities;
(v) 150 kV and EHV substations at the power station;
(vi) cooling water intake and discharge canals;
(vii) fresh water supply; and
(viii) associated buildings and structures.
The total cost of the first stage (Units I and II) of the Suralaya Scheme is
estimated at US$622.3 million, with a direct foreign currency cost of about
US$400.0 million (Annex 7).
Associated EHV Project
3.10      The existing 150 kV transmission system in Java, and extensions in
progress, would not be adequate to utilize power from the Suralaya Scheme.
A higher capacity transmission system employing EHV is required. Merz and
McLellan (MI) of the UK has been commissioned to carry out planning, detailed
engineering and design of this EHV system. Funds were provided under Loan
1365-IND for this purpose. By Mlay 1979 the planning study will establish
the voltage (400 kV or 500 kV) and system configuration needed to transmit
power from the 1st stage of the Suralaya scheme to the main load centers.
A precise cost estimate of the associated EHV project will be known only at
that time. On the basis of rough proposals and estimates prepared by PCR in
1976 (study financed through Cr 399-IND of 1975) it is estimated that the
total construction cost of an EHV system linking Suralaya to West and Central
Java would be about US$280.0 million.
3.11      The Bank will not be associated with the financing of the construc-
tion cost of the associated EHV project in view of program constraints. The
Government has approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) which is interested
and has provided US$70.0 million for the project in their FY79 lending program.
Government also has other sources in view. A joint meeting of PLN, ADB, IBRD
and the consultants was held during mid-February 1979 to review ongoing
studies and ensure that the scope of the TD4 May 1979 report embraces all the
requirements necessary for timely decisions on the implementation/financing of
the EHV project. The Bank will follow progress and financing of this associated
EHV project.  Agreement has been reached during negotiations that the EHV
project required to utilize the power from Suralaya will be completed in time.
Subtransmission and Distribution Projects
3.12      PLN's investment program provides adequately for the subtransmission
and distribution expansion projects needed to utilize Suralaya power. Ulti-
mately all this power will be consumed mainly in the West Java region. The



- 21 -
Jabotabek /1 distribution system will require some strengthening. PLN is
currently carrying out a feasibility study to define the scope of expansion
needed. It is expected that the additional investment needed in the Jakarta
system would be about US$100 million, during 1982-85.
Description of the Project
3.13      The project comprises:
(i)  site preparation and cooling water arrangements for an ultimate
3,100 MW thermal power station at Suralaya;
(ii)  supply, installation and commissioning of the first 400 1W
generating unit (I);
(iii) oil handling and storage facilities (for units I and II);
(iv) associated substations at Suralaya;
(v)  associated buildings and structures;
(vi) equipment and training of PLN staff in the operation of large
thermal generating units;
(vii) project management consultants' services for PLN's construction
department; and
(viii) special board of consultants for Saguling hydroelectric
project.
Coal and ash handling facilities are not included as the lead time involved
in procurement is a year shorter than for the main equipment. They will be
included in the project for Unit (II) scheduled to be processed in PLN's
fiscal year 1980/81.
3.14      PLN has a large investment program scattered throughout the archi-
pelago. The present system of monitoring projects by the central construc-
tion department needs to be reorganized on an urgent basis to effectively
cope with the magnitude and complexities of the work ahead. A project
management advisory group is proposed to advise and assist PLN in this regard.
The group would consist of an engineer project manager and three senior experts
in: (a) planning and scheduling; (b) cost engineering; and (c) systems,
methods and procedures. Apart from these full time members, services of
specialist construction engineers, project accountant, computer programmer
and procurement experts may be needed for short periods. The group will
function for 2 years. Within the first six months it will study the present
systems of project implementation and monitoring in depth and make recommenda-
tions. Effective implementation of these recommendations including training
and transfer of expertise would require about 18 months.

- 22 -
3.15      PLN has a program to expand the Tanjung Priok Training Center to
provide high level training in maintenance and operation of large steam
generating units. MONENCO's proposal for training of personnel for operation
of the Suralaya thermal station will form part of this program and is included
in the scope of this project (para. 3.13, item vi). It will include overseas
training with the Central Electricity Generation Board in the UK for the
station manager, 6 senior operators, 4 maintenance engineers and 4 station
engineers who will be associated with the design of the station. In Indonesia,
arrangements will be made for one year courses for classes of 25 each.
3.16      The Saguling hydroelectric project (para. 1.11), included in PLN's
fiscal year 1981/82, is currently under detailed investigation and design.
Feasibility stage investigations were financed through Credit 399-IND. PLN
appointed a special board of consultants for this project on Bank advice
using funds under Cr. 399 and 451-IND. It is considered essential that the
work of this special board of consultants should be continued. Accordingly,
funds are provided in the proposed loan to cover the continuing foreign costs
involved.

3.18      The cost estimate for the Suralaya project was prepared by PLN with
the assistance of MONENCO - the consultant appointed in October 1978 for
detailed engineering and supervision of construction. It is based on (a)
price quotations recently obtained by MONENCO from a number of likely
suppliers and (b) experience on similar projects in Indonesia and elsewhere.
The estimates have been prepared on the basis of contracts for goods and
works with a detailed breakdown into quantities and unit rates where applicable.

Base prices are at end-1978 levels. The prices are net of customs duties.
Physical contingencies have been provided at 10% on civil works and about
3.5% on equipment. These are adequate. Price contingencies on local cost
components have been calculated at 30% in 1979, 20% in 1980, 15% in 1981/82
and 10% in 1983 and after.  Foreign cost components have been assumed to
escalate at an annual rate of 7% through the implementation period.
3.19      The specific cost of the Suralaya Unit I project is estimated at
US$665 per kW installed at end-1978 price levels and US$927 per kW, including
escalation up to 1984. The corresponding costs for Units I and II combined
are US$572 and US$778 respectively.
Amount of Loan
3.20      Out of the estimated direct foreign currency cost of US$207 million,
US$3.0 million is covered by Loan 1513 where a provision was made for a part
of the cost of Engineering of this project. A Bank loan .:)F 1S$175.0 million
is proposed. It will cover a major part of the estimated foreign currency
cost/l of the project, leaving a gap of US$29.0 million. The loan would be
for a period of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
Financing Plan
3.21      The project is expected to be financed as follows:
US$ million equivalent
Loan 1513-IND                                            3.00

3.22      During negotiations agreement was reached with government
that it would provide all finances as necessary to complete the project
in accordance with the implementation program (para. 3.28).
Procurement
3.23      Procurement of equipment under this loan would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding and in accordance with Bank's guidelines.
Indonesian equipment manufacturers are unlikely to be able to participate,
/1  The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be used to finance the
foreign exchange cost of the following equipment and services: (a) boilers
and auxilaries; (b) generators and auxilaries; (c) engineeritg aiid
supervision; (d) training of operators; (e) project management advisory
group; and (f) the Saguling Board of Consultants.

but if they qualify for some items, a 15% margin of preference on the c.i.f.
price, or the prevailing duties, if lower, will be applicable for purposes of
bid evaluation.
Disbursement
3.24      The Bank loan will be disbursed against the following items:
(a) equipment - 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
goods, 95% /1 of the ex-factory cost for locally manufactured goods
and 65% of the total expenditures for imported goods procured
locally; and
(b) consultants' services and training - 100% of foreign expenditures.
No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to loan signing. The
schedule of disbursements is at Annex 9.
Engineering and Construction
3.25      MONENCO will be responsible for engineering, design and construc-
tion supervision of Suralaya power station, except for the EHV step-up
substation (para. 3.26). MONENCO was selected by PLN in consultation with
the Bank following procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. The
contract was signed in October 1978. The first phase of work - preparation
of designs, bidding documents and assistance to PLN in evaluating bids - is
now in progress. Bid documents for the main equipment are under preparation
and will be issued early in April 1979. It is a critical step in the program.
3.26      The design and construction of the EHV substation at Suralaya will
be carried out by MM of UK, also selected in consultation with the Bank for
planning and detailed engineering of the EHV project. Funds for this work
were provided under Loan 1365-IND (para. 3.10).
3.27      The cost of engineering and construction supervision is estimated at
US$12.0 million. About 2,400 man-months are involved, and the average man-month
rate is US$5,000 which includes salary, foreign travel, applicable social
benefits and overheads but excludes housing, provided by PLN.
3.28      Land required for the project was acquired in 1978 and rehabilita-
tion of people displaced completed. Construction of preliminary civil works
is in progress. A detailed program of construction has been prepared on the
basis that the work would be divided into 15 main contracts. The implementa-
tion program is summarized in Annex 10 and Annex 11 shows the schedule of
critical dates for each contract.
3.29      The implementation program is tight particularly in the early
stages up to decisions on contracts. Past experience of procurement under
Bank financed projects shows that since 1976 considerable delays have taken
place after evaluation of bids by PLN. Particularly, the issuance of the

letters of credit has been excessively delayed. In view of the size of this
project and the serious prospect of implementation delays, Bank staff empha-
sized their concern about the numerous steps needed for processing contracts
and the excessive time taken to follow them. The Ministry of Mines and
Energy has intimated that government is currently reviewing the procedures
involved and the question will be given serious attention. The matter will
be further reviewed during a project implementation review between the
Government and the Bank scheduled in June 1979.
3.30      PLN's construction department has general responsibility for the
construction of the project. Following the prevailing practice a project
manager will be responsible for management of construction at site after
contracts are awarded. PLN has experienced personnel for this post and
supporting levels. Experience in implementation of ongoing projects with
PLN has shown that no direct responsibility exists for the entire project.
Responsibility for various aspects of implemetation is fragmented throughout
PLN's organization. There is not enough monitoring of critical steps and
control to minimize delays. The action proposed in para. 3.14 would
eventually improve matters but in view of the importance of effective control
of implementation of this major project, Mr. Sardjono, Director (Planning) of
PLN has been appointed to look after the implementation of the Suralaya
scheme and its associated transmission systems. He will particularly be
responsible for coordinating and securing action on financing, progress of
engineering and procurement. This action is satisfactory and should help to
avoid possible delays in the implementation of the project.
Ecology
3.31      Environmental considerations have been carefully considered by
MIONENCO and PLN in choosing the Suralaya site for the first power station in
Java which will utilize coal. (Project File - item no. B(1) Vol. 3). The
site is located in a remote corner of the West Java coast, the nearest
settled area being a small town (MERAK) some 10 km away. The station
location and design features to deal with stack emission and ash disposal,
reduce the environmental impact to a minimum. Indonesia has not ruled on
environmental standards but PLN is following USEPA standards for design of
its thermal power stations.   The stack (200 meters high) has been designed
to keep emissions within these limits when the power station operates on
Indonesian coal which has a low sulphur content (0.5%).  Ash from the station
will be conveyed to an adjoining dump area, where the natural configuration
permits good drainage. There will be no detrimental effect on the local
ecological system. Colonies and camps have been planned as part of the
project works for permanent employees and construction workers; regulations
for their safety and occupational health will be enforced by PLN.

4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
4.01      PLN's energy sales rose from 1,893 GWh in 1972 /1 to 3,527 Gwh for
FY78 about 14% p.a., on average. Over the same period revenues rose from
Rp 20 billion (JS$32 million) /2 to Rp 106 billion (US$170 million); the
average tariff per kWh sold increased from Rp 8.98 (USg1.4) /2 1972 to
27.5 (US$44.4) in FY78 (a total of 206%) at an average annual rate of
25%. During the 5 years from 1972, operating costs rose from Rp 26 billion
(US$42 million) to Rp 95 billion (US$152 million), or at an average annual
rate of 29%. Operating income was negative until FY77 when the financial
recovery plan that had been agreed with the Bank in the early seventies that
revenues should cover costs for FY79, was fulfilled.
4.02      It was agreed under Loan 1513-IND that PLN would produce during the
consecutive three-year periods from its fiscal years 1982/83 through 1984/85,
and thereafter funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 30% of
its capital expenditures. In order to achieve this target PLN was expected to
make all efforts to reach interim targets in earlier years. The first such
interim target, for the period 1976/77 through 1978/79 was 17%. This figure
was reached during the three-year period ending 1977/78. However, a tariff
increase of about 13% anticipated during the last appraisal was not approved
by the Government and a 14% contribution to construction is estimated for
FY79 /3 without the tariff increase. Despite the setback, PLN's financial
position was sound at end FY78, the current ratio was 4:1, debt service
coverage on an annual basis was 17 times and the debt/equity ratio was 5/95.
A summary of the FY78 balance sheet is given below:

4.03      The efficiency of PLN's operations still requires substantial
improvement. System losses averaged about 25% for the whole of Indonesia for
FY78, varying from about 18% for Jakarta to about 30% in some areas. The
high system losses arise from distribution systems that require rehabilitation,
inadequate metering and billing systems. Theft also plays a role. PLN's
management is aware of all these problems and is actively addressing them. A
targeted loss reduction program is in operation and steps are being taken to
reduce theft. PLN has also instituted training programs for regional staff
to put them in a position to prepare and supervise plans to improve the
operational efficiency of their regions. Under these plans the regions will
forecast GWh sales and revenues, operating costs and the rehabilitation
investments necessary to improve the earning power of the assets used for
operations. These plans are expected to culminate within a few years in
fixing performance targets for each region (see para. 2.06). The process
will require some time in view of the need for training, the placing of the
required staff and the computer hardware and software that may be required;
future Bank operations should include funds to assist PLN implement these
measures.
4.04      PLN has now a large investment program which includes several
major projects and consultants will be employed to prepare and evaluate these
major projects. As understood during continuing dialogues with the Bank, PLN
also recognizes that adequate project preparation and evaluation is necessary
for all other projects. At the suggestion of the Bank staff PLN has now
initiated a specific program using its own funds to train its staff in
project preparation and evaluation techniques. The Bank staff will render
whatever assistance they can in this respect.
4.05      GOI has provided PLN with the funds it has required in the past
mainly in the form of equity. In the future it is expected to provide
construction expenditures as 50% borrowing and 50% equity for foreign costs;
and 100% equity for local costs to the extent not covered by internal cash
generation. GOI policy is to raise all foreign borrowings for state enter-
prises and onlend or pass the funds as equity, bearing any exchange risks
involved. Interest during construction on borrowings is also financed by
GOI. The funds borrowed will be onlent on the same terms and conditions
as GOI receives from foreign lenders including the Bank.
4.06      Historical balance sheets, funds flow and income statements are
shown in Annex 12.
Future Position
4.07      The additional generating, transmission and distribution capacity
that PLN expects to install during FY79 through 87 will cause its asset base
to expand 20 times in current terms over the next nine years. Expenditures
required to meet the construction program are estimated at Rp 9,401 bil-
lion (US$15.0 billion) at current prices, including interest during con-
struction. GOI plans to borrow about Rp 5,955 billion (US$9.5 billion)
or 63% overseas to cover foreign costs; Rp 2,448 billion (US$3.9 billion),
about 26%, would come from PLN's internal cash generation; and the balance of
Rp 998 billion (US$1.6 billion), about 11%, would come from GOI's internal

sources. The above assumes that tariffs would be so fixed, and other necessary
steps taken, to self-finance, on average, 12%/1 for FY80 and 81, 18% for FY82
and 83, 25% for FY84 and 85 and 30% thereafter, of the average of the test
year and the preceding two years' construction expenditures. PLN's financing
plan, based on these assumptions and GOI/PLN financing described in paras.
4.05 and 4.07, is as follows:
Table:  FIThANCING PLAN FY79-87
(Billions of Rupiah and US$)

Total Capital Expenditure               9,401       15.0            100.0
4.08      Government has expressed its confidence that it will be able to
obtain the foreign funds required to finance PLN's development program and to
provide the required equity.
4.09      Currently, PLN's earnings covenant provides self-generation of
30% for the three-year period FY83-85 and thereafter, with indicative targets
of 17% for the three year period ending in FY79 (14% was achieved), 21% for
the three year periods ending period FY80-82 and 25% for the periods ending
FY82-84 on the basis outlined in para. 4.07 above. Devaluation, inflation,
failure to increase tariffs to the level and at the time necessary, revised
cost estimates and phasing of expenditures render it difficult for PLN to
achieve these ratios as a tariff increase of 58% (para. 4.11) is required to
produce 12% self-generation for FY80 and a tariff increase of much greater
dimensions is not a reasonable expectation. It was therefore agreed to
continue the existing earnings covenant using the interim annual percentages
given in para. 4.07.
/1 Assumes that the tariff increase of 58% will occur mid-year (see para.
4.11); target percentages for FY80, 81, and 82 are based on this assumption.



- 30 -
Revaluation of Assets
4.10      Under Loan 1127-TNI), PLN has an obligation to revalue assets
every four years (FY79 is the first year) with the assistance of consultants,
using methods of revaluation acceptable to PLN and the Bank.  Agreement
was reached dutring negotiations of the proposed loan that PLN shall revalue
its net fixed assets, including consumers contributions, annually on the
basis of Gross Domestic Investment Deflator as calculated by the Bureau of
Statistics, oTn the understanding that the revaluations need not be incor-
porated in PLN's books.
Tariff Levels
4.11      A tariff increase, estimated at about 58% from October 1, 1979
(mid-FY8O), is required to meet the earnings targets for FY80 through FY82.
The Government wishes to choose an opportune date during the current fiscal
year to increase the tariffs. Accordingly, during negotiations an understand-
ing was reached that a tariff increase of this magnitude will be implemented
not later than March 31, 1980, the end of the fiscal year.
4.12      If PLN is to provide from internal resources the contributions to
investments assumed in para. 4.07, average tariff levels per kWh and the %
increases required to achieve them are as follows:
Current prices                           Constant FY80 prices
FY   Rp/kWh    USi      % inc.   % Cum.            Rp/kWh  US    % inc.   % Cum.

Future Operating Results
4.13      The financial forecasts are based on overall figures that have been
estimated: for Java, based on the energy and demands that the plant and
facilities estimated to be available are capable of generating, transmitting
and distributing to consumers; for outside Java, figures are rough estimates
of likely demand, GWh sales and capital and operating expenditures for each
region. On that basis energy sales are estimated to increase from 3,527 GWh



- 31 -
in FY78 to 19,700 GWh in FY87, an average annual growth rate of 21%. Based
on the earnings targets detailed in para. 4.07, energy revenues are forecast
to increase from Rp 97 billion (US$155 million) in FY78 to Rp 1,379 billion
(US2,206 million) in FY87, an average annual growth rate of 34%; operating
expenses are forecast to grow from Rp 95 billion (US$152 million) to Rp 1,022
billion (US$1,635 million) by FY87 after escalation at an annual average of
about 7% for all operating costs and 10% for fuel, with depreciation based on
assets revalued from FY79, giving an annual growth rate of 37.0%.
4.14      A downward trend in the operating ratio from 90% for FY78 to 73% by
FY87 indicates the improved financial condition over the forecast period.
PLN's high cost continues to be projected through FY87 as indicated by the
constant price tariff increases revealed in para. 4.12. Over the next
ten years decreases in tariffs in real terms would be expected given the
economies of scale that will ensue and the improvement in the efficiency of
PLN's operations that management is expected to bring about.
Debt Control
4.15      Government currently assumes the exchange risk on all foreign debt
borrowed to finance state enterprises and this situation is assumed to
continue throughout the forecast period. PLN's current debt control test
provides: (a) for the Bank to be consulted on borrowing when net revenues of
the 12 month period or the fiscal year prior to the incurrence of debt, is
less than 1.3 times maximum future debt service; and (b) a debt equity ratio
of not more than 60/40 to ensure reasonable borrowing levels. It was agreed
to continue these tests for the proposed loan.
Current Position
4.16      The current ratio has varied in the past from 17.7 to 4.1, and for
FY78 it was 4.1, a healthy liquidity position; for FY79-87 it is expected to
vary between 3.5 (FY79) and 1.5 (FY86) which is satisfactory. Consumers
receivables, which were about three months billing at end FY78, have been
projected to reduce progressively to two months billing by FY87.
4.17      Inventories of Rp 40 billion in current assets and Rp 18 billion of
spares in gross plant, were high at end FY78, aggregating to about 16% of
gross plant on a historical basis. Current asset inventories were about 10%
of gross plant for FY78 and are forecast to reduce to 1.5% of revalued gross
plant by FY87.
4.18      Income, funds flow statements and balance sheets, forecast through
FY87 are shown in Annex 13 and assumptions incorporated in these financial
forecasts are shown in Annex 14.
Corporation Tax
4.19      PLN is subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 45% of net
income; the corporation has applied for tax exemption to the Ministry of
Finance which has indicated that the exemption is likely to be granted and PLN
awaits the formal notification. Consequently the financial projections do not
assume liability to corporate income tax.



- 32 -
Subsidiary Loan
4.20      As in previous operations, the Government has agreed during nego-
tiations to relend the proceeds of the proposed Loan to PLN on terms
equivalent to those of the Bank loan. In addition, the Government will
finance interest and commitment charges during the grace period of the Loan
which is in line with financing practices in the country. Signing of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement is a condition of Loan effectiveness.
5. JUSTIFICATION
Demand Forecast
5.01      Based on the latest PLN demand forecasts (para. 1.37), simulation
studies of operation of the Java power system have been carried out by PLN.
These show that a new base load power station would be needed by early
1984,/i as the energy potential of hydroelectric/steam stations, existing
and under construction, would be fully utilized by then, and gas turbines
would have to be operated, outside peak hours, at uneconomic levels. These
studies also show (Annex 15) that, PLN will be unable to meet the forecast
load demand by March 1984 without Suralaya. The total capacity margin at
that stage would be reduced to the unacceptable level of about 12%. The
project would increase the margin to about 30%, which is not too large for an
expanding system, with relatively large size generating sets. The actual
position could be worse than the simulation indicates as it has been based on
idealized annual maintenance schedules which do not take into account possible
initial delays, teething troubles with new sets, problems in building up
expertise in efficient maintenance of large size generating sets or their
inevitable long term (3 year) overhaul requirements.
Least Cost Solution
5.02      In the comprehensive Java System Development Study (para. 3.03) PCR
has recommended a least cost development sequence of generation expansion
which remains unchanged when tested for sensitivity within the wide limits of
the low and high forecasts (Annex 4). The results were tested for discount
rates up to 15%.  The next feasible step in this expansion program is the
Suralaya dual-fired (coal and oil) thermal station in West Java. Both PCR
and MONENCO feasibility studies have tested the implications of employing
unit sizes ranging from 300 MW to 500 MW: these show negligible differences
in economy. MONENCO recommended a unit size of 400 MW, which PLN has accepted;
the decision is appropriate.
5.03      A scheme which has about the same order of merit as the project, is
the 700 MW Saguling hydroelectric project, currently in an advanced stage of
/1 According to the PCR Java System Study, installation of this new station
was recommended by 1982 to meet its projected demand growth. PLN's actual
sales lagged during 1975-77 but have picked up since.

investigation in West Java. With a firm energy potential of 1,580 GWh (180 MW
continuous), it is more of a peaking station, however. Further, its inves-
tigations have revealed geological features which require detailed investiga-
tions that may increase feasibility stage cost estimates. In any case, the
project requires a minimum construction period of about 7 years and the power
station cannot be commissioned earlier than 1985/86. Detailed engineering of
the Saguling project is being carried out by PLN with the assistance of
Japanese consultants and PLN has included it in its FY81 program. Its commis-
sioning immediately following Suralaya is technically sound.
5.04      The 150 kV island-wide interconnection under construction which will
be completed during 1980-82 will not be adequate to carry power from Suralaya
station to the main demand centers. An EHV system, linking Suralaya to
Jakarta and Semarang is therefore necessary. The distribution systems in West
and Central Java would also need to be strengthened; proposals have been made
in this regard and are included in PLN's development program.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
5.05      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is the discount rate
which equalizes the economic costs and benefits attributable to the project.
The internal economic return has been calculated for both Units I and II
combined (i.e. the first stage of the Suralaya scheme) and the associated
transmission system (para. 5.04) as it would be difficult and unrealistic to
separate the costs and benefits (particularly of the associated EHV system) of
this essentially integral project, which has been subdivided into closely
sequenced implementation phases, for reasons of limiting annual financial
commitments. The project cost and benefit streams and details of shadow
pricing are provided in Annex 16. Ideally, the benefits should be measured in
terms of the consumers' willingness to pay, but since this is practically
impossible to evaluate, the incremental revenues based on the prevailing price
of Rp 27.3 (4.4 c) have been used as a proxy for total benefits. The above is
a minimum measure of benefits principally because consumer surplus is ignored.
On this basis, the IERR is 12%. The rate, despite low tariff levels, reflects
the economy of scale of this large base load station. At the proposed tariff
level of Rp 43.3 (6.9 c) per kWh, the IERR would be 20%.
Risks
5.06      There are no risks of an engineering nature as there are no inherent
uncertainties in this type of work. Site conditions are favorable and an
experienced consultant is assisting PLN in project implementation. There is
a risk, however, of delays arising out of time consuming procedures for
approval of PLN's evaluation of bids by the agencies concerned. The Government
is expected to review the causes of these delays and to take all possible
steps to reduce them (para. 3.29).



- 34 -
5.07      It is necessary to mention the very remote possibility that a part
of the investment on this project which is required for making the steam
generator suitable for coal firing may become redundant if the second (i.e.
implementation) phase of the Bukit Asam coal mining and transportation project
(para. 1.06) is postponed for economic or other reasons. This is unlikely
because the delivered cost of coal would be lower than the estimated economic
break cost of about US$37.0 per ton. The incremental investment is about
US$10.0 million. Provision of facilities for coal firing at Suralaya at this
stage is therefore justified,
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following:
(a)  a new tariff structure based on long run marginal costs would be
introduced by March 31, 1980 (para. 1.43);
(b)  the EHV transmission project required to utilize power generated at
Suralaya project will be comoleted in time (para. 3.11);
(c)  government will provide all the finance required to complete
the p'roject in accordance with the implementation program (para.
3.22);
(d)  PLN will generate from internal sources 30% of construction
expenditures for the test year and the two preceding years, with
interim targets of 12%, 18% and 25% for the three year periods
ending FY80/81, FY82/83, and FY84/85, respectively (para.4.07);
(e)  PLN will revalue assets each year based on the Gross Domestic
Investment Deflator as calculated by the Bureau of Statistics
(para. 4.10);
(f)  about 58% increase in tariff level not later than March 31, 1980
(para. 4.11); and
(g)  existing debt control tests will be continued (para. 4.15).
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$175 million to the Republic of Indonesia for a term of 20 years including
5 years grace, with interest at 7.9% p.a., with onlending on the same terms
to the beneficiary, the Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN). The foreign
exchange risks will be borne by the Government.
6.03      Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and
PLN will be a condition of effectiveness of the Loan (para 4.20).

Assumptions in the Financial Forecasts
Revenues
1.        Revenues have been forecast at existing tariff levels for FY79.
For the remainder of the period through FY87 they are forecast at the levels
required to generate over the test year and the two preceding years, 12% for
FY80 and 81, 18% for FY82 and 83, 25% for FY84 and 85 and 30% thereafter of
the same three years' construction expenditures.
Fuel
2.        Fuel has been priced at the 1978 prices escalated at 10% each year
for FY79 onwards as follows:
1978 Price Level                     Rp
Coal (per Kg)                       10.38
Residual Oil (per liter)            31.00
Industrial diesel (per liter)    33.00
High speed diesel (per liter)    36.00
Gas (per Kwh)                       11.00
Operating Expenses
3.        Operating expenses are based on FY79 costs and as estimated by PLN
for personnel, operating, maintenance, and administration escalated at the
following rates %:                  e
Year   80    81    82    83    84    85   86    87
%    47.0  9.0   6.4   6.9   7.25   6.8   7.0   7.2
Depreciation
4.        Depreciation is based on the straight-line method at the following
rates %:

Administration and buildings,
telecoms, etc.                   6.25                    6.66
Capital Expenditures
5.        Capital expenditures are based on the expenditures needed to meet
the least cost program of generation and transmission development for Java
required to meet PCR's low demand forecast and estimates of distribution
expenditure for Java and generation, transmission and distribution for other
areas as estimated at 1979 prices by PLN before the devaluation and a review
of cost estimates during appraisal. Expenditures other than those for Java
are not yet based on demand forecasts but will be so based in the near
future. Escalation has been based on about the rates in para. 4 for operating
expenses.
Borrowings and Equity
6.        Borrowings have been assumed at 50% of the foreign costs included
in construction expenditures. The assumed average terms of the loans are 19
years including four years grace at 9% p.a. Equity which is assumed to come
from Government, is the balance required each year in the funds flow statement
to provide PLN with adequate working capital, including cash.

/d   At 2% of capital costs.
Ie   Costs of coal are at the average of cost range PLN expects (US$22.5
per ton); operating pattern 1986-2000 70% load factor; 2001-2010,
60% LF and 2011 to 2015 at 40% LF.
/f   Figures in Column 3 are at prevailing average tariff level (Rp 27.3
per kWh), and in Column (4) to increased tariff level (Rp 43.35 kWh).
Jg   Figures in column (5) correspond to prevailing tariff levels and
in column (6) to increased tariff level (Rp 43.35 per kWh).
The IERR is 12% for the net benefit stream at Column (5) and 20% for Column (6).
If the cost of coal delivered at Suralaya is US$36.0 per ton, the corresponding
IERR's would be 11.0% and 18.0% respectively.
