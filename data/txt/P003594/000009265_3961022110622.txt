1. BACKGROUND
A. INTRODUCTION
1.1  Investigations of the Shule River Basin in Hexi Corridor for irrigated agriculture
development and land settlement were carried out by Gansu in the early 1950s, followed
by decades of project planning, ad hoc and increasingly better planned implementation,
and review. The Gansu Provincial Study conducted by the Bank Group in 19851
concluded that irrigation development in Hexi Corridor would be a logical means of
alleviating poverty and significantly reducing provincial food deficits. Since then,
various Bank Group missions, while supervising the ongoing Gansu Provincial
Development Project (Agriculture Component) Ln. 2812/Cr. 1793-CHA of FY87, had
discussed the project and guided Gansu in project preparation for ultimate Bank Group
financing. The proposed project in Shule River Basin has been identified to have high
developmental potentials and has long been supported by the Bank Group. However, due
to Gansu's counterpart funding constraint, the proposed project was only finally accepted
by the central government for Bank Group financing in the FY96 lending program as the
earlier poverty-oriented project approached completion. The project was prepared in
September 1994, preappraised in May 1995, and appraised in September 1995.
B. SECTORAL OBJECTIVES AND BANK LENDING
1.2   China's agriculture feeds a population of about 1.2 billion. Land resources are
scarce (about 0.1 hectares-ha-per capita). Water resources, although abundant in the
south, are scarce in the north and northwest, limiting expansion and development of
agriculture. Agricultural reform, begun in 1978, has helped to reduce the incidence of
rural poverty by about 170 million people, from 270 million to about 100 million people
by 1985. However, since 1985 there has been only a small decline in the incidence of
absolute poverty. The earlier gains in rural incomes have come mainly from areas
endowed with favorable natural resources, whereas the mountainous regions of southwest
and northwest China remain poor due to harsh natural elements and relative
overpopulation. China's poverty reduction strategy is now focused on raising incomes
and living standards of people in these poor regions through investment in agriculture and
land development, rural works and enterprises, provision of basic social services, and
facilitation of emigration to better favored areas.
See World Bank Country Study entitled "China-Growth and Development in Gansu Province," World
Bank, Washington DC, 1988.

1.3   Bank Group lending for agricultural projects with direct poverty alleviation
interventions include:   Northern  Irrigation  (Cr. 1885-CHA), Gansu Provincial
Development Project (Ln. 2812/Cr. 1793-CHA), Loess Plateau Project (Cr. 2616-CHA),
Southwest Poverty Reduction Project (Ln. 3906/Cr. 2744-CHA) and Shanxi Poverty
Alleviation Project (FY96). Other agricultural projects that include poverty reduction
subprojects in numerous extremely poor counties are:   Shandong Agricultural
Development Project (Cr. 2017-CHA), Shaanxi Agricultural Development Project
(Cr. 1997-CHA), Henan Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 2242-CHA), Tarim Basin
Project, Xinjiang (Cr. 2294-CHA), Guangdong (Cr. 2307-CHA) and Sichuan (Cr. 2411-
CHA) Agricultural Development Project.  These projects have made a real and
sustainable contribution to poverty reduction, with the Northem Irrigation Project doing
so in part by assisted emigration of poor upland peasants to newly irrigated areas (para.
1.9)
C. IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN CHINA
1.4   China achieved rapid expansion of irrigated farmland from the early 1950s to the
mid-1980s. Through expansion in irrigation, the effective irrigated area increased from
about 20 million ha in 1952 to 33 million ha in 1965, 45 million ha in 1976 and 48.5
million ha in 1984. However, after 1985 the area declined and stagnated at about 45
million ha due to a net loss of cultivated land to nonagricultural use (including some land
which should never have been developed, now reverted to grassland) and reduced
investment in water resources development by both central and local governments. The
productivity of irrigated land is about twice that of rainfed land as irrigation allows both
higher cropping intensities and higher yields. Irrigated agriculture accounts for about two
thirds of total grain production and three quarters of commercial crop production.
1.5   Despite past successes, China continues to face problems in the irrigated
agriculture sector. Continued depletion of water resources, coupled with degradation of
water quality by industrial pollution and chronic uneven regional distribution of water
resources, continues to constrain irrigated agriculture development and expansion. Many
of the large schemes constructed in the 1950s and 1960s in haste are aging fast and need
rehabilitation. Operation and maintenance in many areas are still inadequate due to the
insufficient resources allocated. The government's short-term strategy is to selectively
improve and rehabilitate some of the more urgent and priority areas that would provide
quick returns with minimum investment, while the long-term plan calls for interbasin
transfer of water to resolve regional water shortages. There is still potential for increasing
production from existing irrigated farmland through better water management and higher
irrigation efficiency. New irrigated agriculture development would be limited and
confined to smaller river basins with adequate water resources.
D. IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND POVERTY IN GANSU PROVINCE
1.6   Gansu, located in the northwest arid region, is a resource poor province with a
population of 22.6 million, 84 percent of which is rural. Agricultural production is



- 3 -
largely affected by harsh natural elements (topography, climate, land and water) and a
weak production infrastructure. The province is deficit in food grain production. Over
the last two decades the province had to import grain to feed its increasing population,
especially those in the upland areas of central and southeast Gansu where the harsh
climate and marginal land and water resources cannot sustain an increasing population.
Of the 3.5 million ha of cultivated land, only about 1.07 million ha are irrigated. It is
planned to increase the total irrigated land to about 1.25 million ha by 2000 and 1.33
million ha by 2010.
1.7   The province has 41 officially identified absolute poor counties with about 4.26
million people living below the absolute poverty line and depending on government relief
for food, clothing and fuel. Although some progress has been achieved under the poverty
reduction programs of the "Two Xi"2 Commission since 1983, much more needs to be
done. The province has formulated a seven-year plan to reduce the incidence of poverty
for about 4 million people. The 1,000 kilometer (km) long Hexi Corridor in the
northwest region of the province (the route of the ancient Silk Road), with its favorable
climate and better resources, offers a long-term solution to reducing the province's deficit
in food grain and alleviating poverty.
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT
1.8   The project would directly address two of the Bank Group's main operational
priorities in China-poverty alleviation, and environrnental enhancement and protection.
The project is also consistent with the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the
Progress Report of March 26, which supports in-situ income-generation programs in
lagging provinces, upgrading of marginal agricultural lands, major water storage, and
irrigation and drainage development. This is in line with the strategy jointly developed
by the government and the Bank for reducing absolute poverty in the 1990s.3 It
complements the government's Ninth Five-Year Plan and addresses two of the key
challenges facing rural development in China: relative stagnation of income growth in
rural area, and large-scale water shortages in the north and west.  Bank Group
participation in the project will play a key role in developing a prototype large-scale
settlement project integrated with irrigated agriculture in the Hexi Corridor of western
Gansu Province where large tracts of land exist for potential future development, for
example, the Corridor's Hei River Basin has potential of similar settlement development
for poverty reduction for 80,000 to 100,000 people. The project would also serve as a
development model for rational use of limited land and water resources in small self-
contained river basins in the water scarce regions of Northwest China. In addition, Bank

Reducing Poverty in the 1990s" and the "International Conference on Poverty Issues in China" held in
Beijing, November 1992.

Group involvement would provide access to the Bank Group's (and international
consultants') experience and technologies in development of irrigated agriculture for arid
regions, settlement planning and management, and environmental protection and
management.
F. LESSONS LEARNED
1.9   The Bank Group has assisted China in financing various agricultural projects
aimed at raising incomes and living standards in the rural areas. These projects have been
or are generally being implemented efficiently with benefits and performance exceeding
appraisal estimates. In Northwest China, the Yinan component of the Northern Irrigation
Project (Cr. 1885-CHA), in neighboring Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and the
agricultural  component  of  the   Gansu   Provincial  Development  Project
(Ln. 2812/Cr. 1793-CHA) have direct poverty reduction programs to settle a total of
135,000 people from resource-poor areas to newly developed irrigated land. Settlement
of 55,000 people in the Yinan component has been successfully completed and that for
the Yindaruqin component (Gansu) with 80,000 people has just begun due to belated
completion of the irrigation facilities, involving construction of major civil works over
mountainous terrain (90 km of Feeder Channel comprising 39 tunnels, pipe siphons,
aqueducts and lined canals). The relative success of these Bank-financed agricultural
projects can be attributed to a high degree of commitment by local governments at all
levels, effective project planning, design and management, and active participation by
local communities and project beneficiaries.
1.10 A recent Bank mission4 to assess the results and impacts of poverty-reduction-
through-voluntary-resettlement programns in Ningxia implemented under the Bank-
financed Yinnan Component of the Northern Irrigation Project (Cr. 1885-CHA) found the
results to be very positive in reducing absolute poverty and providing greater level of
incomes after resettlement on newly irrigated land. The investment has been cost-
effective with quick realization of benefits. The mission also found that the large number
of Hui minority people resettled have not only maintained their cultural and religious
integrity, but further rebuilt and strengthened them with their increased incomes, which
they could not afford in their former villages. Key issues identified by the mission
include: (a) newly irrigated land to be provided to each settler should be allocated to
achieve either high incomes or a greater number of beneficiaries; and (b) programs should
not exceed the carrying capacity of the existing available resources. Gansu's project staff
planning the settlement component have visited and studied the successful voluntary
resettlement programs completed for 55,000 people under this Bank-financed project in
Ningxia.

(Consultant Anthropologist) visited Ningxia November 5-10, 1995.

1.11   Gansu's own experience in poverty alleviation through land settlement were both
negative and positive. The failures5 of earlier settlement in Hexi Corridor implemented in
the late 1950s and 1960s were attributed to the involuntary nature of settlement,
inadequate planning, lack of supporting services and infrastructure, and settlers not able
to adapt to the new environments. The more successful poverty reduction programs were
those carried out by the Two Xi Commission since 1983 with better planning and
resources. Some 337,000 people have been settled since 1983, the majority of them in
the Hexi Corridor. Local community leaders and project planners are still mindful of the
initial settlement failures in Hexi and the inherent risks involved without adequate
planning and provision of essential support services. Experience and lessons learned
under the Two Xi Commission poverty reduction programs carried out over the last
decade have been reflected in the planning and design of the voluntary settlement model
for the proposed project.
1.12 From Bankwide experience, the OED's review (No. 72, September 1994) of five
completed transmigration projects in Indonesia provides useful guidelines for the
planning and design of the Hexi Corridor settlement component. Though socioeconomic
conditions, project designs and programs are somewhat different, some of the findings
and lessons identified by OED are relevant. These include: (a) security of guaranteed
incomes for settlers is more important than levels of income, (b) proper and thorough
field investigations should be undertaken prior to settlement, (c) greater settler
participation in project development and more opportunities for income-generation
activities for women are required, (d) a strong and stable institution is needed with a clear
settlement strategy and plan to ensure successful implementation, (e) there must be a
gradual buildup of local capacity, supported by adequate resources, to absorb the large
transmigrating society, and (f) more attention should be paid to protection of the
environment. The above relevant OED findings and lessons have been reviewed with
Gansu project planners whose voluntary emigration and settlement plan has already taken
most the above findings and lessons into consideration.
5 During the Great Leap Forward period (1958-59), a large number of settlers from densely populated
agricultural areas of Southeast China were settled in the Hexi Corridor as a means of reducing
population in southeast China and increasing labor availability in Hexi Corridor. However, many of the
settlers left and returned to their home areas by the early-1960s. A similar failure occurred in the late
1960s when a number of youths from Tianjin were sent to the Hexi Corridor; they were only permitted
to return to Tianjin in the early 1980s.

2. THE PROJECT AREA
A. LOCATION
2.1   The proposed project area, located in the Shule River Basin in the farthest western
corner of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province, is administered by Anxi County and
Yumen City of Jiuquan Prefecture. It is bordered on the west by Hami District of
Xinjiang Autonomous Region, on the north by Inner Mongolia and on the south by the
Qilian Mountains in Qinghai Province. IBRD Map No. 27591 shows the general location
of the project area.
B. CLIMATE, TOPOGRAPHY AND SOILS
2.2   The project area has an inland arid continental climate with short hot summers
and long cold winters. Annual total rainfall ranges from 50 to 70 millimeters (mm)
against annual total evaporation of 3,000-3,200 mm. The frost-free period ranges from
117 to 182 days, averaging about 140 days. This restricts agriculture to only one main
crop per year.  However, long sunshine hours (2,960-3,260 hours annually) and
abundance of solar energy are very conducive for vegetative growth during the planting
season. More detailed climatic data are given in Annex A, Table 1.
2.3   The total proposed Shule River watershed area is about 4,130 square kilometers
(kmtn) with about 1,330 km2 located above the proposed Changma Dam site. The middle
reach (1,200 knm) and the lower reach (1,600 km2) contain three existing partially
developed irrigation districts with ground elevation ranging from El. 1,100 to 1,600 m.
The proposed project area is generally flat, consisting of alluvial, deluvial and alluvial fan
plains with higher relief sloping from south to north. Ten south-north gullies of 4-10 m
deep intersect the plains. Fringing the project area are the Gobi Desert and permanent
and semipermanent sand dunes. Strong wind, sand storms and scorching heat waves are
common occurrences, especially in Anxi County located in the west of the project area.
2.4   Primary soil materials are of alluvium and silt with secondary materials of aeolian
and red clay of the Tertiary Period. The various soils are classified in Annex A Table 2.
Soil nutrients are low in nitrogen, deficient in phosphorous and relatively low in organic
content. Appropriate soil improvement and dressing would be required for optimum crop
production.

C. WATER RESOURCES
Surface Water
2.5   There are two major rivers in the project area: Shule and Chejin Rivers. The
average long-term runoff of Shule River, measured at Changma Station, is about 1,031
million cubic meters (Mm3) and that of Chejin River, measured at Shiyou Gorge Station,
is about 51 Mm3. Yearly and seasonal distributions are not even, with about 53 percent
of annual quantity occurring during July-September, about 8.5 and 10 percent during
winter and spring for the Shule River. The total annual runoff varies from 536 Mm3 for
dry years (1956-57) to 1,507 Mm3 for abundant water years (1972-73). The long-term
(1952-89) average flow per second is 32.8 cubic meters per second (cms), with a
maximum annual average of 47.8 cms and minimum of 17.0 cms. Presently, the main
Shule River is not fully regulated and only about 42 percent of its annual runoff is
diverted for agricultural and domestic use. Chejin River has been fully used with its flow
in the upper reaches, the Shiyou River, extracted for industrial and urban uses. Only a
limited quantity in the lower Chejin River flows into the existing Chejinxia Reservoir
used for irrigation.
2.6   Water quality of Shule and Shiyou Rivers has been monitored by four sampling
stations on each river. Their results are presented in Annex D Table 5. For the Shule
River, despite a relatively high concentration of zinc, the water quality is generally
suitable for irrigation purposes. The water quality deteriorates somewhat after entering
and leaving the Shuangta Reservoir with a higher concentration of mercury and
mineralization, but still conforming to the irrigation water quality standard.6 The Shiyou
River, upper stretch of Chejin River, is presently polluted by 36 points of industrial and
urban effluent discharges. Actions are in hand to control and abate this water pollution.
Due to natural dilution while flowing downstream, the water quality improves somewhat
before entering the Chejinxia Reservoir. With the proposed diversion of 61 Mm3 per year
from the proposed Changma Trunk Canal to augment the water supply in Chejinxia
Reservoir, the water quality would be further improved through dilution.
Groundwater
2.7   Total groundwater resources are estimated at about 704 Mm3 per year, with
65 percent from river seepage, 21.5 percent from canal seepage, 11 percent from
irrigation' infiltration, and the remaining from subterrain flow, storm and rainfall
infiltration. Present extraction and use of groundwater is rather limited (40 Mm3) due to
availability of cheaper surface water and the lack of electric energy. Mineralization of
groundwater varies from 1 to 3 grams/liter and is generally suitable for crop irrigation.

D. POPULATION, LABOR, FARM SIZE AND LAND USE
2.8   The 1993 total population in the project areas under Yumen City, Anxi County
and local State Farms was estimated at about 124,320, with rural population of 105,890
(85 percent). This includes an immigrant population of 13,150 people. The population
density at 7.1 persons/km2 is low compared to the provincial average of 49.3 persons/
km2. Total rural labor force is only about 53,100 and there is a general shortage of labor.
Landholding per family is comparatively large with an average 0.31 ha cultivated land
per capita (0.6 ha per capita in state farms). Farming is mechanized to a large extent in
view of large farm size and labor shortage. The large tracts of potentially arable land are
capable of absorbing additional immigrant population without affecting the economic
holdings of the existing population. The basic statistics of the project area are given in
Annex A Table 3.
2.9   The present land use of the middle and lower reaches of Shule River is low as
shown in Annex A Table 4. Out of the total area of 1,932,400 ha, 146,800 ha (7.6
percent) is used for agriculture and forestry, 150,000 ha (7.8 percent) under pasture,
6,500 ha (0.3 percent) for residential and industrial use.  Some 1,645,600 ha (85.3
percent) remain unused, of which 228,500 ha (11.8 percent) is barren arable land suitable
for reclamation and agricultural development.
E. RURAL INCOMES AND POVERTY
2.10  Per capita rural income of the project area (average Y 1,400) exceeds the
provincial average (Y 430) and the 11 emigrating counties (Y 220-Y 320) in central and
southeast Gansu. Higher per capita incomes are mainly due to better utilization of
resources through irrigated agriculture and cultivation of larger landholdings.  The
200,000 persons proposed for voluntary settlement under the project are now living in
absolute poverty with per capita income less than Y 300 due to poor resources, degrading
environment and increasing population. Voluntary emigration and settlement in Shule
River Basin under the project would alleviate their absolute poverty within three to four
years and thereafter rapidly enhance their economic well-being to the same level of the
existing farmers in the project area. Annex A Table 7 compares the demographic and
socioeconomic situations of Gansu Province, the project areas, and the 11 emigrating
counties.
F. PRESENT DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRAINTS
Irrigation and Drainage
2.11  Irrigation development in the Shule River Basin dates back to the early Qing
Dynasty, some 350 years ago. Due to scanty population, large expanse of land and
primitive irrigation facilities, only about 17,300 ha were irrigated prior to the 1950s.
Through major reconstructions carried out during 1956, 1966 and 1984, the total area
irrigated has now been expanded to about 43,300 ha under three irrigation command



areas-Changma (25,500 ha), Shuangta (14,500 ha) and Huahai (3,600 ha). The
irrigation facilities constructed to-date are tabulated in Table 2.1 below
TABLE 2.1: EXISTING IRRIGATION FACILITIES
Facilities                         Changma          Shuangta         Huahai

Lateral Canals (no/kn)             179/341          180/335          88/132
2.12   The existing Changma Intake diverts about 430 Mm3 annually or about 42 percent
of the long-term average annual flow of Shule River. About 340 Mm3 is used for
irrigation in the Changma Irrigation Area, 40 Mm3 is sent to augment the Shuangta
Reservoir in the Shuangta Irrigation Area and 10 Mm3 for Chejinxia Reservoir in the
Huahai Irrigation Area. About 40 Mm3 is used for domestic and industrial water supply.
Other supplementary water sources used include 180 Mm3 from springs and 36 Mm3
from groundwater.
2.13   The main constraints confronting the present irrigation system are: (a) due to lack
of upstream flow regulation of the Shule River, only about 42 percent of the annual
average is being effectively used with the remaining running to waste, resulting in
frequent water shortages during the irrigation peak demand periods; (b) the main canal
systems are aging fast and in poor condition, resulting in low canal system efficiency of
43 percent to 49 percent; (c) lack of adequate on-farm facilities, leading to poor water
control and management; (d) lack of drainage facilities for soil salinity control in some
areas; (e) the West Main Canal in Changma Irrigation Area is a temporary earth channel
without proper canal control structures and suffers from serious bank erosion and seepage
losses, and poor water conveyance; (f) the East Main Canal is poorly aligned in its upper
reaches and needs to be realigned for better water conveyance; (g) problems of frost
damage to canal concrete-linings need to be resolved; and (h) the overall water
management standard is low and needs to be improved. The proposed project would
address the above deficiencies.
Crop Production
2.14   Currently, the project area has 43,300 ha of irrigated land. During the 1993
season, 32,900 ha was planted with various crops with a total output value of Y 235
million, which represented about 49 percent of the total agricultural output value for 1993
(see Annex A Table 5). The production came from 13 townships and 4 state farms



- 10-
supporting a total population of 124,320 people (rural population of 105,890). Per capita
cultivated land by farmers is 0.62 ha (1.00 ha by state farm worker). Cultivation is
mechanized to a high degree:  plowing 89-100 percent, sowing 77-100 percent and
harvesting 37-75 percent. Due to the high solar radiation energy and where irrigation
water supply is assured, the average unit yields7 achieved have been consistently well
above the province's average yields for various crops (see Annex A Table 6). The
present production systems are well managed and supported by a satisfactory basic
agrotechnical extension and support services system at county and township levels (a
similar system also exists in the State Farm hierarchy). The characteristics of production
systems are summarized in Annex A Table 8.
2.15   Crop production models and experience already exist in the project area, including
that of land settlement by immigrant settlers.  This would undoubtedly facilitate
reclamation and development of 54,600 ha of new land for irrigated agriculture and
settlement. The main constraints currently confronting increased crop production are:
(a) lack of irrigation facilities and water; (b) saline and salinized soils requiring
amelioration; and (c) frequent sand storms and scorching heat waves. The proposed
project would attempt to minimize the impacts of these physical constraints.
Livestock
2.16   The project area is an important livestock production base in the Province. It has
large tracts of natural grazing grounds and abundant supply of cultivated pastures and
crop residues from the irrigated cropland. Current production is mainly by specialized
households and small household production. The holding stock at the end of 1993 were:
large animals 31,800 heads, sheep 127,700 heads, pigs 65,000 nos. and poultry 352,500
birds. Per capita production of meat, egg and milk in 1993 were: 40.6 kg, 10.3 kg and
1.75 kg. Except for milk (lower by 2.5 kg), the per capita production of meat and egg
exceeded the province averages by 17.9 kg and 5.9 kg, respectively. However, due to
increasing demands by tourism and major mining industries and urban centers in the Hexi
Corridor, the present production can only meet 70 to 75 percent of the demands for meat,
eggs and milk. It is projected that production would have to increase by 2.03-, 3.2- and
9.4-fold by the end of 1990s. The processing of feed and forage is generally of small
scale and low quality. Efficiency of feeds could be improved through appropriate
blending with fine feeds and concentrates. The Animal Husbandry Department maintains
a satisfactory veterinary services and technical extension system at county and township
level to support the production.
7 The average unit yields for wheat and corn reported for Anxi County and Yumen City for 1989-93
were higher than those of the state farms. This is due to more intensive cultural practices adopted by
small family farms, higher inputs and better established on-farm windbreaks that provided oasis effects,
which are more conducive for crop growth.



Forestry
2.17  Gansu Province has forest cover of about 8 percent, which is below the national
average of 12.3 percent. Historically, the Shule River Basin was covered with lush forest
and pasture, but through years of wars and destruction by man, these endowments have
long been destroyed. Since the 1950s, the State and provincial government have
launched campaigns of afforestation, closing off desert for reforestation, controlling large
tracts of desert and sandy soil areas against grazing for purpose of conserving vegetation.
The project area has also benefited from the national "Three North" Shelter Belt
Programs completed under two phases to control desertification in Northeast, North and
Northwest China. Currently, the project area has 9,971 ha of protective forest, 2,645 ha
of agroforestry and 2,153 ha of border windbreaks, providing a forest cover of
4.2 percent. Forestry development and production is generally low cost, labor intensive
and of simple technology specially adapted for the project area.
G. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT
2.18  Overall, the present agricultural production systems in the project area have
satisfactory basic institutional support that, however, would need to be upgraded and
expanded to cope with increased demand under the project. Present status of various
sectors are summarized below:
(a)   Irrigation and Drainage Research. Research and experimentation topics
investigated in the past by various provincial and national units in the
project area included canal seepage, damage to canal linings by frost
action and swelling of clayey soil, irrigation application rates, soil
amelioration methods, and feasibility of subsurface pipe drainage. Results
of some of the more successful experiments have been used and promoted.
However, due to lack of resources, these studies have been scaled down
considerably. Currently, the Shule River Water Conservancy Management
Office (SRWCMO) still maintains a small experimental station near
Yumen Township, doing experiments on irrigation techniques as to
number of irrigation applications, timing, quantity, for different crops with
the aim to economize use of irrigation water. The project would support
and strengthen the research and experiment facilities with provision of
equipment and staff training.
(b)   Agriculture. Support services for crop production are provided by the
existing agrotechnical extension centers in Anxi County and Yumen City,
which have laboratory facilities for soil analysis and other analytical work,
agrimachinery service stations and seed companies. The Gansu Academy
of Agricultural Sciences maintains a research station at the prefecture
center of Jiuchuan and this station serves the needs of the project area.
Under the leadership and guidance of county, prefecture and province, the
townships and farms have been able to obtain quality seeds, extension of



- 12 -
new technology, pest control, and production techniques for high-yielding
and high-value crops.
(c)   Animal Husbandry. The project area has 177 technical staff; 14 of which
are professional and 53 senior and middle level staff. The veterinary and
technical extension services system consists of two county centers and 19
township stations. Supporting production are two pasture stations, five
quality stock breeding farms, two livestock products trading companies
and two processing enterprises. Further institutional support is provided at
Jiuchuan Prefecture and provincial levels for research, technical support
and staff training.
(d)   Forestry. The Forestry Bureau maintains a total of 157 staff and workers
in the project area, of which 45 are technical staff. Services are provided
through the two county forestry technical extension, disease and pest
control, and seedling centers. The Bureau also operates I forestry farm, 2
nurseries and 20 township forestry stations.  Research is mainly
undertaken by the national "Three North" Shelter Belt Program and the
results disseminated to the project area for application.
H. INFRASTRUCTURE
2.19 The project area is well served by the existing Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the
National Highway No. 312, supplemented by a comprehensive network of roads at
prefecture, county, township and village levels. Domestic flights from Lanzhou land
regularly at Jiayuguan and Dunhuang, both fringing the project area.  With the
completion of the multitrack Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the provincial fiber-optic
telecommunication system, transport and communication capacity for the project area
will be further expanded, thereby facilitating industrial, rural enterprise and agricultural
development.

3. THE PROJECT
A. OBJECTIVES
3.1   The main objectives of the project are to: (a) alleviate poverty of some 200,000
poor farmers from the resource poor areas of central and southeast Gansu Province by
emigrating and settling on newly developed irrigated land in the Hexi Corridor;
(b) increase agricultural production in Gansu Province, especially in food grains and
commodity crops; and (c) protect and restore degraded environments.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.2   The principal project components are:
(a)   Changma Dam (55 m high) on Shule River to provide effective storage of
about 100 Mm3 of water for irrigation and water supply;
(b)   Irrigation and Drainage-improve facilities for 43,300 ha existing and
develop 54,600 ha new irrigated land in three irrigation districts;
(c)   Agriculture-crop production, support services, agrimachinery services
and livestock production;
(d)   Land Settlement for 200,000 immigrant farmers from resource-poor areas
on newly developed irrigated land in 16 new townships and 160 villages;
(e)   Environmental Protection  and  Management through  afforestation,
monitoring, soil and water conservation practices; and
(f)   Institutional Strengthening and Support through provision of staff training,
technical assistance, equipment, vehicles and essential facilities.
C. PRINCIPAL FEATURES
Changma Dam
3.3   The proposed Changma Dam would be 55 m high with a crest length of 365 m
and a zoned earthfill embankment with a central clay core. A side channel regulated
spillway, with three gates (10 x 7.7 m), would have discharge capacity of 1,655 cms. An
8.0 m diameter concrete-lined 300 m long diversion tunnel on the left abutment to be
built during the construction stage would be used later for silt flushing purposes. The
water intake concrete-lined tunnel (5.5 m in diameter x 500 m long), located on the right
abutment, would divert water for irrigation downstream after passing through a surface



- 14-
powerhouse with a total installed capacity of 14.25 MW (3 Francis turbines; 2 x 6.5 MW
and 1 x 1.25 MW). Some 8,320 m of buildings and 53 km of access roads will also be
constructed to facilitate operation and maintenance.
2
3.4   The Changma Dam would create a reservoir covering about 12 km of area with a
total storage capacity of 194 Mm3, out of which 80 Mm  is dead storage. The dead
storage for siltation is projected to last for 37 years with silt flushing carried out during
the annual high stage flow, commencing from July to early August. A flow simulation
study carried out serially using 41 years of flow records (1952-93) of Shule River shows
that for 34 out of 41 years the surface water resources alone are insufficient to meet the
projected water demands. Thus, groundwater would be required for supplement. Only
17 years show a net water deficit over the conjunctive supply of surface and groundwater.
In 14 years, the net deficit is less than 5 percent of the total projected demand, in 2 years
about 10 percent, and only in one very dry year (1956) does the deficit reach 30 percent
of the demand. The overall water balance situation is satisfactory. However, the risk of
drought does exist and a drought crisis management contingency plan would have to be
included in the operation of the irrigation system (see para. 4.12). On completion, the
Changma Dam would provide better regulation of flow in the Shule River, thereby
increasing annual irrigation supply from 430 Mm3 to 926 Mmn3 and the flow utilization
rate from 42 to 90 percent.
3.5   Reservoir Resettlement. The Changma Reservoir would require involuntary
relocation and resettlement of 131 families (566 persons) and acquisition of 172 ha of
cultivated land. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in accordance with
the provisions of Bank OD 4.30 and submitted to the Bank/IDA (see paras. 3.48-3.49 and
Annex E for more details). The RAP has been reviewed and accepted by the Bank for
implementation. A summary of the RAP is given in Annex E.
3.6   Dam Safety. An international panel of experts (appointed in accordance with
Bank OMS 3.80) has reviewed the safety aspects of the dam design in April 1995. The
panel considered the layout and structural design of the dam to be basically safe and
recommended further refinements to the design, which have now been incorporated in the
design.' The panel will be retained to review safety aspects of the dam during its
construction stage. The panel has also reviewed the safety aspects of the two existing
reservoirs, Shuangta and Chejinxia, and found them to be basically safe for operation
subject to recommended remedial works being carried out. Gansu has agreed to complete
these recommended remedial works not later than December 31, 1998. At negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that it would (a) complete remedial
works to Shuangta and Chejinxia Reservoirs not later than December 31, 1998; and
(b) carry out periodic safety inspections of the completed Changma Reservoir, and the

existing Shuangta and Chejinxia Reservoirs in the project area, according to practices
and procedures9 acceptable to the Bank/lIDA.
Irrigation and Drainage
Irrigation
3.7   Irrigation facilities would be improved on an existing 43,300 ha and expanded to
54,600 ha new land to be reclaimed under the following three irrigation areas:
(a)   Changma Irrigation Area.  The existing Trunk Canal Main Intake
Complex would be shifted 6 km upstream towards the Shule River Gorge
and a new trunk canal constructed to connect with the existing one. This
would reduce the seepage losses in the river channel located between the
new and existing intake sites. The existing pair of trunk canals (total
capacity of 65 cms) will continued to be used, but the first 19.4 km of the
older trunk canal will have its lining of conglomerate stones replaced with
concrete for better efficiency. A new bifurcation gate is required for the
East/North Main Canals. A new 49.5 km long lined-canal along a new
alignment complete with proper canal control structures will replace the
existing West Canal earth canal which is in very poor condition.
Connecting to this new canal, four existing and two new submain canals,
totaling 105.6 km, would be improved and constructed. The East Main
Canal will have its capacity increased to 7.6 cms, serving ultimately a total
of 8,020 ha. Part of the canal will be improved by canal realignment and
replacement of canal lining and control structures. The North Main Canal
will have its capacity increased to 9.1 cms to increase irrigated area from
5,467 ha to 10,500 ha. The canal will be extended by about 0.95 km and
about 10 km of the existing canal will have its damnaged lining replaced.
The South Main Canal, basically in good condition, will have its capacity
increased from 4.6 to 6.2 cms to serve 5,800 ha. A total of 196 branch
canals, totaling 653 km, will be improved and constructed. To take
advantage of the available hydraulic head, one minihydro power station
each will be incorporated into the New Trunk Canal (Extension) Intake
(12 MW installed capacity) and the New West Main Canal Intake (6 MW
installed capacity). Some 24,600 m 2 of offices and buildings, and 288 km
of rural roads complete with bridges and culverts will also be constructed
to facilitate operation and maintenance of the irrigation area. With the
improved and expanded facilities, Changma Irrigation Area will increase
from the present 25,500 ha to 56,870 ha.
9 Periodic safety inspections would be carried out in accordance with Regulation No. 77 on
"Management of Reservoirs and Large Dams" enacted by China State Council on 3/22/1991.



- 16-
(b)   Shuangta Irrigation Area. Primary irrigation works completed include
the Shuangta Reservoir, Anxi Trunk Canal, South and North Main Canals,
and 32 branch canals totaling 275 km, 35 percent of which are lined. The
Shuangta Reservoir, strengthened in 1984 to correct foundation and
seepage problems, has now a total capacity of 170 Mm3. The reservoir
will be augmented with 216 Mm3 annually from the Changma Trunk
Canal with completion of the new Changma Reservoir. The 32.8 km Anxi
Trunk Canal will have its present capacity increased from 24.5 cms to
28 cms to serve about 31,070 ha. The South Main Canal will have its old
intake at the end of the Anxi Trunk Canal replaced and the downstream
stretch realigned for 18.5 km. Included in the improvement and extension
are various canal control structures, bridges and flood spillways. The
North Main Canal, totaling 35.2 km, will have 13.5 km improved, 10.4 km
expanded, and 11.4 km newly constructed, complete with canal lining and
ancillary structures. To reduce seepage losses in conveyance, a new
43.2 km Xihu Submain Canal, starting at the end of the North Main canal
will be constructed to replace the existing Shule River used to convey
water to Xihu cotton-growing area. The existing 29 branch canals in
Shuangta area will be improved for 108 km out of 145 km and some
97 km will be extended or newly constructed, complete with canal lining
and control structures. Some 7,500 m2 of offices and buildings, and 40 km
of rural roads complete with bridges and culverts will also be constructed
to facilitate operation and maintenance of the irrigation area.  On
completion, the total irrigation area will be increased from 14,500 ha to
30,670 ha.
(c)   Huahai Irrigation Area. Irrigation water is diverted from the Changma
Trunk Canal via the 43.3 km Shule-Hua Main Canal into the Shiyou River
and regulated in the downstream Chejinxia Reservoir. The present Huahai
Irrigation Area intake is located 11 km downstream of the Chejinxia
Reservoir and about 10.4 Mm3 of water is lost annually through seepage
along the river channel above the intake. Under the project, it is proposed
to shift the intake further upstream 5.5 km with a designed capacity of
7.55 cms. The Huahai Trunk Canal will be expanded for 1.1 km up to
Chainage 8+650, from there a new 12 km trunk canal of 5.9 cms capacity
running parallel to the existing trunk canal would be constructed. The
East Main Canal, 5.25 km long and commanding about 2,000 ha, will have
its capacity expanded to 1.75 cms. Canal lining, control structures and
bridges would be improved and added. The West Main Canal will be
improved for 2.0 km and extended 5.7 km with its capacity increased to
2.9 cms to serve 3,300 ha. The North Main Canal, 7.7 km long and
serving 4,646 ha, will have its capacity increased to 4.1 ems.
Improvement and expansion would include downstream canal bank raising
and lining replacement. A total of 20 branch canals would be improved
(37 km) and constructed (57.6 km). Some 3,200 m2 of offices and



- 17-
buildings, and 40 km of rural roads complete with bridges and culverts
will also be constructed to facilitate operation and maintenance of the
irrigation area. The improved and expanded facilities will increase the
irrigation area from 3,600 ha to 10,670 ha.
Canal System Efficiency
3.8   The present overall canal system efficiency is only estimated at 50 percent
(Changma 54 percent, Shuangta 43 percent, Huahai 54 percent) due to aging of the canal
system and incomplete lining of the canal systems. The project designed efficiency is
62 percent, although somewhat high, but achievable due to the extensive canal linings
being proposed for the canal network, improved system operation and maintenance, and
establishment of a computerized system for monitoring, simulation and dispatch of
irrigation water.  The projected canal system  efficiency would be affected by a
combination of factors:  soil and topography conditions, size and length of canal
networks, quality of system construction and canal linings, and standard of operation and
maintenance. The system efficiency would be progressively built up with completion of
the irrigation works and, therefore, this would need to be progressively monitored for the
canal system in each of the three irrigation areas. Project risk and sensitivity analyses
(para. 6.20) were carried out using a range of lower efficiency (60 and 55 percent)
evaluated against project benefits (area irrigated and the number of settlers) and the actual
efficiency achieved and monitored.
Canal Lining
3.9   Due to porous and sandy soils, adequate and extensive lining of the canal system
would be required to achieve the desired canal system efficiency. Most of the lining in
the existing irrigation areas would be improved or replaced, and new ones constructed in
the new irrigation areas. Damnage to canal lining caused by frost action and upheaval of
clayey soil supporting concrete lining during cold winter seasons is a serious problem in
the project area. Based on past experience learnt and studies carried out, Gansu has
evolved designs of canal lining to meet different soil and water table conditions. These
designs have been reviewed by the Bank/IDA and found to be technically sound and cost
effective. The designs include use of precast concrete panels and slabs, in-situ concrete,
large conglomerate stones set in concrete, geomembranes and replacement of clayey soil
materials with gravely and sandy soils of low moisture retention capacity under the
concrete linings to minimize swelling and upheaval during cold weathers. Details of
these designs are given in Annex I Appendix 6.
Drainage and Salinity Control
3.10  Reclamation of Salinized and Saline Soils. Of the 54,600 ha of new lands to be
reclaimed, there are about 39,000 ha (71 percent of total) salinized and or having saline
soils, with area distribution as follows:

3.11   The reclamation of saline lands will be implemented through leaching of saline
soils in combination with drainage and agricultural measures. According to experiments
carried out in the state farms and experience in areas with similar conditions, the leaching
quotas required for reclamation of soils with different salinity levels are as shown in
Table 3.1 below.

3.12   On-farm Drainage Systems. For the reclamation of salinized and saline soils,
on-farm drainage systems consisting of lateral, sublateral and field drains will be
constructed. Generally, two layout schemes of irrigation and drainage systems are to be
adopted: (a) with sublateral drains constructed adjoining to sublateral irrigation canals;
and (b) with sublateral drains built in between sublateral irrigation canals. For scheme (a)
the spacings of both sublateral irrigation canals and drains are 250-400 m, while for
scheme (b) the spacing is 400-600 m. Field drains with depth varying from 1.7-2.2 m and
spacing of 70-150 m, depending upon the texture and hydraulic conductivity of soils, are
temporarily constructed during reclamation to accelerate leaching. These field drains will
be leveled at the maintenance stage. For nonsalinized and light soils, based on the
experience of state farms and irrigation districts with similar conditions, only sublateral
drains are required with spacing of 250-400 m. In areas where groundwater of low
salinity is used conjunctively with surface water, only lateral and sublateral drains are
necessary to supplement the vertical drainage provided by tubewells. The reclamation of



- 19-
54,600 ha wastelands will be implemented over a period of 10 years from 1996 to 2005 (see
Annex H Table 2).
3.13 Main and Branch Drains, and Drainage Outlets. In addition to the main Shule
River and Beishi River carrying drainage to the wastelands lying to the west and north of
the project area, the existing primary and secondary drainage systems will be
supplemented with construction of the following additional drains in the three irrigation
districts to cope with increased drainage from the expanded irrigation area:
Irrigation District                Main Drain                  Branch Drain

Groundwater and Tubewell Development
3.15   The exploitable groundwater resources in Changma, Shuangta and Huahai
Irrigation Districts and planned groundwater extraction are as shown in Table 3.3.

3.16   With the completion of the project, the surface runoff will be regulated by the
Changma Reservoir and groundwater recharge will come mainly from seepage losses of
irrigation canals and deep percolation of irrigation water in the field, which are more or
less uniformly distributed. Therefore, the extraction of groundwater, the number and
location of tubewells in different areas will be planned according to the groundwater
recharge in those areas. The groundwater drafted would be used conjunctively with
surface water. Tubewells would be constructed adjoining to surface irrigation canals to
augment irrigation canal supply. During periods when canal water is not available, the
ground water is used for irrigation of vegetables, tree crops and other crops, especially
during drought when surface canal water supply is limited. Some 730 tubewells would
be constructed under the project, mostly in the Changma Irrigation District, to
supplement the surface irrigation water.  The locations and spacing of these new
tubewells would be subject to detailed investigations.'
Water Resources-Supply, Demand and Quality
3.17   The total water resources available annually in Shule River Basin has been
estimated at 1,220 Mm 3; 1,082 Mm3 surface water and 138 Mm3 groundwater. Based on
the demands for ultimate development under the project, the total demand would be about
1,071 Mm3; 969 Mm3 for agricultural use and 102 Mm3 for industrial and domestic use.
Table 3.4 below shows the breakdown of use, demand and supply for a normal year
(P=50%). The surface supply would only be made possible through regulation of the
Shule River by the proposed Changma Reservoir.
10 The present groundwater regime will be changed as a result of increased Shule River flow regulation
and diversion for irrigation to the expanded areas. The future extraction of groundwater should
preferably be based on results of groundwater model simulation.

3.18  The overall water quality of the main Shule River" supplying the main bulk of
water for irrigation is within China's standard GB 3833-88 Grade II for surface water for
irrigation. As part of the lower stretch of the Shule River is being used to convey water
to the Shuangta Reservoir for irrigation of Shuangta Irrigation Area, it would be
necessary to monitor the potential increase in salinity in the Shuangta Reservoir water
due to planned reclamation of some 10,100 ha of salinized soils drained by this stretch of
the Shule River.
Agriculture
Agricultural Support Services
3.19 With the immigration of new settlers, the population of Yumen Township would
be increased by about 30 percent and that of Anxi County doubled. Therefore, the
investment for agricultural support services would reflect these population changes.
Moreover, the design and delivery mechanism of agricultural support services would be
made flexible to meet emerging needs of the migrant settlement development over the
course of time. Consideration would also be given to promote competitive markets in
most types of services to be provided by enterprises, companies and specialized
households. New migrants settled on State Farm administered land would enjoy existing
support services under the State Farm system which is self-sufficient in most of the
The water in the smaller Shiyou River has been extensively used by industries and Yumen City and is
polluted, but only an insignificant quantity is used for irrigation.



- 22 -
services. The proposed agricultural support services under the project are summarized in
the following subcomponents:
3.20 Agrimachinery Services. A total of 16 township/subfarm agrimachinery service
stations would be built progressively over the project implementation period to provide
agrimachinery services on fee basis to the new migrant farmers. The size and capacity of
these stations would take into consideration the small-size farm holdings, existing
capacity of agrimachinery specialized households from adjoining townships, and
migrants using own machinery and draft animals to meet their needs. The composition of
the proposed machinery and equipment for each station is summarized in Annex B
Table 7. It consists mainly of 4 medium-size bulldozers, 1 each scraper and land leveler,
3 55-hp tractors, 4 plows, 2 harrows and 3 sowing machines for each station. To
maximize use of machinery, the bulldozers, scrapers and land levelers would also be used
in land reclamation work, and the tractors for general transportation. Each station will
have a built-up area of 300 m2 and be equipped with workshop repair facilities. Four fuel
depots will also be built to serve these stations and the public. These stations will be
operated and managed by the Provincial Agrimachinery Service Bureau.
3.21   Seed Production and Processing. Quality seeds are available in the project area
for all crops, including most of the secondary crops. County seed companies produce and
sell most of the seeds to farmers; 100 percent of the hybrid corn seeds and 20-25 percent
of wheat with the remaining being produced by farmers. Only sugarbeet and vegetable
seeds are imported from outside the county. State farms in the project area produce and
process their own seeds. To meet increased demands for seeds under the project, it is
proposed to expand storage, processing and transportation capacity of the existing Yumen
Township Seed Company, and to equip a seed analytical laboratory. Similar expansion is
also proposed for the Anxi County Seed Company in addition to setting up a
multiplication system for quality cotton seed, including 227 ha of seed production farm
and processing facilities. The county seed companies would be encouraged to contract
with farmers to produce quality seeds rather than expanding development of their own
seed farms. In line with the national policy, county seed companies would also be
encouraged to review and increase their subsidized seed prices so as to make their
operations more viable and efficient, and as a measure to discourage farmers from
overseeding when seeds are priced too cheaply. Optimal seeding rate for various crops
would also be promoted through farmer extension programs and field adaptive research
and demonstrations. Further support for quality seeds will be provided through a seed
processing subproject being prepared under the proposed FY96 Seed Sector
Commercialization Project. This will be located in the project area's Huanghua State
Farm, with an annual capacity of 12,500 tons, mainly for wheat, hybrid corn and barley.
3.22  Extension. Yumen Township and Anxi County each have one existing extension
center with offices for some 15 technicians, soil analysis and plant protection
laboratories, and classrooms for training activities. The organization setup of the existing
Anxi County Agrotechnical Extension Center is shown in Chart 4. These two centers
would be expanded on the basis of number of new migrants coming into the township and



- 23 -
county. Existing townships have an extension station each staffed with 2 to 4 technicians
per station making the farmer/technician ratio about 1,000 under Anxi County and 500
under Yumen Township (compared to 45 under the State farms). Transportation has been
identified as a major constraint facing county centers and township stations. Therefore,
sufficient vehicles would be provided under the project. For each of the proposed new
settlement townships/subfarms, an extension station would be established. Extension
staff would be trained to man these new stations with appropriate skill-mix and
experience. The extension programs to be undertaken by the county centers and township
stations would be based on the integrated training programs planned for the new migrants
(see Anncex).
3.23   Research. Research activities to support the agricultural production would focus
on on-farm applied research for the new settlement areas. This would be undertaken
mainly by the Jiuchuan Prefecture Agricultural Research Institute, Gansu Provincial
Academy of Agricultural Sciences located at Jiuchuan on contract with the Project
Management Office. Topics suggested by the Jiuchuan Research Institute for applied
research, subject to evolving needs and further detailed investigations, include the
following:
(a)   selection and breeding of improved varieties,
(b)   adaptive research on water-saving irrigation techniques,
(c)   adaptive research on soil fertility improvement in newly reclaimed areas,
(d)   follow-up of pest, diseases and weeds,
(e)   adaptive research on vegetable production,
(f)   screening of crops and species tolerant to salt and climatic risks,
(g)   adaptive research to increase the efficiency of agricultural inputs (seeds,
fertilizer and irrigation water), particularly on wheat, both in the existing
and the new irrigated areas,
(h)   cotton pest integrated management, and
(i)   selection of early, quality wheat varieties.
The Jiuchuan Research Institute would use existing facilities of the existing county
extension centers as no new research facility would be provided under the project, except
for funding of some essential equipment to supplement those to be provided by the
Jiuchuan Research Institute. Results of successful applied research would be extended to
farmers through the county extension system.
3.24  Cost Estimates.  The cost estimates for the above four subcomponents are
summarized in  ex B Table 9.



- 24 -
Livestock Development
3.25  The livestock component would initially focus on strengthening existing
veterinary and technical-extension services and production of poultry and pigs through
family farms and specialized households. As the new project areas are developed and
settled, village (or farm) technical-extension and veterinary service stations would be
established. At the later stage, commercial livestock production would be undertaken
through establishment of various demonstration bases in the project area. The main
subcomponents are summarized as follows:
(a)   Establishment and Improvement of Livestock Extension Network:
(i)   expansion and equipping of city/county animal husbandry and
veterinary service centers for training and extension;
(ii)   replication of animal husbandry and veterinary stations for the 16
new townships and subfarms.
(b)   Included under Overall Project Management:
(i)   training of city, county and township staff;
(ii)   training of existing farmers and new  settlers in livestock
production techniques.
(c)   Production and Supply of Improved Livestock:
(i)   layer fertile egg/chick production farm in Yumen City;
(ii)   broiler fertile egg/chick production farm in Anxi County;
(iii)   egg hatching facilities in 33 townships/subfarms;
(iv)   lean boar production farms in Yumen and Anxi;
(v)   lean sow production farms in 33 townships/subfarms.
(d)   Fodder Production and Feed Processing:
(i)   feed and fodder processing in 33 townships;
(ii)   pasture seeds for farmers;
(iii)   pasture seed production farms;
(iv)    grassland fencing of key areas for rehabilitation/protection;
(v)    watering points to improve utilization of grasslands;



- 25 -
(vi)   complete protection of temperate deserts (rangeland).
(e)   Credit for Production: The following credit facilities would be made
available through the Y 15 million revolving fund provided under the
Voluntary Settlement Component (para. 3.32):
(i)   credit for the procurement of improved livestock (specialist
farmers);
(ii)   credit for small farmers to procure livestock.
The cost estimates for each subcomponent and the investment activities for each of the
existing and new townships are summarized in Annex B Table 10.
Afforestation
3.26  The proposed afforestation is primarily to: (a) protect the fragile land from wind
erosion and enhance eco-environments for crop production and human habitation;
(b) provide a source of fuelwood energy for the new settlers; and (c) provide soil and
water conservation measures in the catchment area of the Changma Dam. Upon
completion, the vegetative cover in the project area would be increased from 4.2 percent
to 8.5 percent, thereby enhancing the primitive and fragile arid eco-environments in the
project area. The typical technical designs of afforestation for the project area are given
in Annex I Table 5. The various proposed subcomponents are summarized below:
(a)   Eco-environment Protective Forest Belts: To protect and improve the
fragile eco-environments of the project area, three fringe forest belts
totaling 236.6 km covering 290 ha in area would be planted. The northern
project boundary running to the west would have a belt of 115.2 km
covering 138.2 ha. Planting will be four rows at spacings of 1.5 x 2 m and
I x 2 m. The northern Anxi County boundary will have a similar four-row
belt of 86 km covering 103.2 ha. The third belt is located along the East
Main Canal with a length of 35.4 km and 180.7 ha. In addition, forest
belts will be planted along three main roads with a total length of
112.9 km covering an aggregate area of 84.2 ha. The vegetative cover of
some 109,080 ha of sandy areas and sand dunes would be conserved and
protected to prevent livestock grazing, thereby helping prevent ingress of
sand dunes and desertification into the cultivated areas.
(b)   Wind Protection and Agroforestry: For wind protection of the project
area, primary and secondary windbreaks, based on main and branch canal
networks, would be planted. A total of 98 lines of windbreak forest,
covering 704.7 km and 504.7 ha, would be planted. The 56 primary
windbreaks, in a south-north direction in line with the prevailing wind,
would cover a total length of 428.6 km and an aggregate area of 394.7 ha
with tree planting spacing at 1.5 x 2 m. The secondary windbreaks,



- 26 -
running generally in east-west direction, total 42 lines of 276.1 km and
area of 110 ha. In addition, it is planned to plant on-farm single-row tree
borders based on 5 percent of newly reclaimed area and 2.5 percent of
existing cultivated area. The total area covered by on-farm tree borders
would amount to 3,820 ha. Agroforestry would consist of planting of fruit
trees in residential areas and development of an orchard covering
3,333.3 ha.
(c)   Fuelwood Forestry:  As a supplementary source of energy to coal,
fuelwood trees would be planted at spacing of I m x 2 m along Gully
No. I to No. 10 with an aggregate area of 1,000 ha. This fuetwood forest
would provide sustainable harvesting of fuelwood for the new settlers.
(d)   Soil and Water Conservation Forest: An aggregate area of 3,330 ha
would be planted with shrubs and trees in gullies and along river banks
and slopes located upstrearn of the Changma Reservoir area in the vicinity
of Tien Shen Chiao and Er Tao Chuan so as to reduce soil erosion caused
by surface runoff, thereby reducing the silting of the Changma Reservoir.
The dam catchment area has been declared a protected forest area by the
Gansu Provincial Government. At negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Gansu that the Changma Dam catchment area in the Qilian
Mountain Range would be maintained and protected as a protectedforest
area by December 31, 1998 and at all times thereafter.
D. VOLUNTARY EMIGRATION AND LAND SETTLEMENT
3.27  As a means to reduce the incidence of absolute poverty in the province, 200,000
people will emigrate voluntarily from 11 of the poorest counties in central and southeast
Gansu and settle on the newly developed irrigated land under the project. At the same
time, the new migrant settlers would also provide the labor force required for project
construction and economic development of the project area. Presently, the per capita
grain production and income in these 11 counties are less than half of the national
average, and well below the average of Gansu's 41 officially identified poor counties (see
Table 3.5 below). The land in these upland regions is steep, badly eroded, nonirrigated
and inaccessible. With increasing population, these counties run large deficits of grain in
each year and many of the absolute poor in the remote valley villages and townships have
to rely on annual governnent relief for food, fuel, clothing, etc.

(Project Area)
aLa Figures are for rural population only.
3.28   A master land settlement plan has been prepared to relocate 200,000 people over a
period of 10 years. In all, 95 townships with planned quota of emigrants for each
township have been selected for the emigrating 11 counties (see details in Annex F Table
2). Within them, prospective settlers would be filly informed of the benefits and risks of
migration and settlement, their obligations and right to refuse.  Applications for
emigration would be strictly voluntary, systematically processed (screened by the
respective village committee, reviewed by township government and approved by county
government). Selection of settler households would need to meet the criteria'2 established
by Gansu Government. Some 10 percent of settler households with moderate income and
education level would also be selected for settlement. Past experience shows that these
moderate-income settlers would readjust and succeed very quickly in the new settlement
areas and would be useful to serve as models or lead farmers to others.
12 The two-stage selection criteria for settler households are:
First Stage:
(a) per capita income of less than Y300 and grain production <150 kg;
(b) at least two workers in the household with head of household between 18 and 50 years of age;
(c) at least two years of primary education or acceptable literacy level (relaxed for minority applicants);
(d) experience in agricultural production;
(e) willingness and positive attitude towards emigration; and
(f) in good health and mentally sound, not physically handicapped.
Second Stage:
(a) per capita income less than Y150 and grain production <50 kg;
(b) demonstrate intensive desire to emigrate;
(c) 75 percent of the existing cultivated land is on above 25 degrees slope;
(d) possess junior middle school education, technical skill and vocational trade training; and
(e) demonstrate pioneering spirit and leadership.



- 28 -
3.29 During the first year of emigration, only working members of family would move
to the new settlement areas to take part in the project construction. Dependents will only
emigrate during the second or third year after a household head has decided to stay on (he
would have the option of returning to his original residence within the first two years).
Each family will contract for at least 30 years 2 mu (0.13 ha) per capita of irrigated land
for cultivation without any form of repayment. In addition, each family can lease, with
rent payment13, an additional 1.5 to 2.0 mu per capita, depending on their economic well-
being and availability of family labor. The lease is subject to renewal after 10 years.
Each settler family will also be allotted 534 m2 for housing and 667 m2 for planting
vegetables and fruit trees. Based on a family of five persons, the per capita land allocated
would be 0.157 ha. Large family farrns, with maximum land holding of 10 ha, would
also be promoted; but the number would be limited to 150 farms.
3.30   Each settler will cost about Y 1,100: comprising Y 750 for relocation expenses
and housing materials, Y 100 for basic water and electricity supplies, Y 100 fuel supply
for the first two years, and Y 150 for purchase of agricultural tools and production inputs
during the first year of settlement. New migrant settlers will also be exempted from
payment of land and agricultural taxes for the first three years of their settlement. The
new settlers would be placed in 16 new townships to be established in the three irrigation
districts. Each township will encompass 10 administrative villages, each village will
have 5 to 10 residential sites with 250-300 families in each residential site, and a
population of 12,500-13,500 people in each township. During the initial settlement, basic
education (primary and secondary schools) and health facilities would be provided by the
project to each township and village. Later, as the settlements stabilize and grow, the
local governments would provide the other necessary amenities and services.
3.31   About 25 percent of the emigrant settlers will be from minority groups, mostly
Islamic Hui and Dongxiang. Although no separate settlement plan has been proposed for
the minority groups, the relevant provisions of Bank OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples
have been taken into consideration. To maintain their cultural and religious integrity,
these minority groups will be settled together (as will the majority Han), following as
much as possible their earlier residential groupings.  This would help the rapid
reconstruction of social networks in the new settlement areas. The current settlement
master plan provides for one Dongxiang minority township, and 16 Hui minority
administrative villages to be established. The minority migrants would also enjoy
preferential policy incentives, such as relaxation on selection criteria (literacy level),
priority for employment, credit facilities, and exemption for payment of primary school
fees and textbooks.
13 Rent payment for leased land:
I st-3rd year- zero.
4th-6th year-Y 75 per 0.1 ha or Y 50 per mu.
7th-IOth year-Y 150 per 0.1 ha or Y 100 per mu.
After 10th year-Subject to renewal and negotiations.



- 29 -
3.32 Under the project, Gansu will use its own funds to establish a revolving fund of
Y 15 million to provide credit to migrant farmers to assist them in purchasing production
inputs, operating small rural enterprises and family business. The credit will be of low
interest (0.24 percent per month) and for short-term period (2-3 years) with a maximum
amount of Y 2,000 per household so that a large number of migrant households can be
benefited. Preference would be given to women and minority migrants. The revolving
fund would be managed by the Agricultural Bank of China and the Rural Credit
Cooperatives for the Project Office on a fee basis. At negotiations, assurances were
obtained from Gansu that a revolving fund would be established not later than
December 31, 1996 to provide credit to migrant farmers under arrangements acceptable
to the Bank/IDA.
3.33  The existing County Settlement Offices (CSOs) in each of the 11 emigrating
counties and the host Anxi County and Yumen City will implement, administer and
manage the emigration and settlement programs entrusted to them by the Project
Management Bureau (PMB). The CSOs will be responsible to the respective County
Emigration and Settlement Leading Group (CESLG). A Settlement Advisory and
Coordination Committee will be established to advise and coordinate with PMB in
drawing up the annual settlement programs and budgets for implementation by CSOs.
The Settlement and Social Services Division under the PMB will oversee the
implementation by CSOs. More details of the organizational and management structure
are given in para. 4. 10. The Population Research Institute of Northwest China, Lanzhou
University will monitor the settlement over the project implementation period,
establishing a database to track the social and economic status and progress of settlers.
3.34 At negotiations, assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that Gansu
Province would (a) implement the emigration and settlement plan based on annual
programs and budget reviewed and agreed by the Bank/IDA, monitor annually the
progress of implementation and furnish the results to the Bank/IDA not later than
March 31 of the following year; (b) lease all land distributed to settlers rent free for a
minimum of 30 years, and (c) lease up to an additional 2.0 mu per capita to settlers on
1 0-year renewal lease with acceptable rates of rent.
E. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND STRENGTHENING
3.35  Training. Staff training would be focused on improving technical competence
and acquiring technical skills in (a) drainage and water and soil salinity control,
(b) operation, maintenance and management of large irrigation areas, (c) water resources
monitoring, simulation and dispatch in Shule River Basin, (d) management of large-scale
human settlements, and (e) optimization of agricultural production in arid regions,
covering crops, livestock and forestry. This would be achieved mainly through study
tours, attendance at international seminars and workshops, and training courses conducted
by subject specialists. The training programs and estimated costs are given in Annex B
Table 6. At negotiations, assurance were obtained from Gansu that training would be
carried out according to a time-bound action plan acceptable to the Bank/IDA.



- 30 -
3.36  Technical Assistance. Technical assistance in the form of consultant services,
totaling about 100 person-months of foreign and local specialists as detailed in Annex B
Table 7, would be provided to assist the Project Management Bureau in: (a) supervision
of civil works construction of the Changma Dam by ICB contract; (b) planning, design
and implementation of a basinwide system network for monitoring, simulation, control
and dispatch of surface irrigation water integrated with the extraction and use of
groundwater; (c) planning, design and implementation of a basinwide environmental
monitoring of land and water resources impacted by the project's activities; and
(d) monitoring and evaluation of new migrant settlers as to their socioeconomic well-
being.
3.37 Building, Vehicles, Equipment. The project would build an office complex at
Yumen Township to house the Project Management Bureau and supporting facilities.
One county training center each would be built at Anxi and Yumen City for use to train
project staff at lower levels for all sectors, local leaders and lead farmers in participatory
aspects of the project development. To ensure and facilitate smooth implementation of
the project, sufficient quantities of office equipment and vehicles would be provided to
the PMB, and the county implementing agencies. Details of equipment and vehicles are
given in Annex B Table 3.
F. STATUS OF PROJECT DESIGNS
3.38  Detailed designs complete with bill of quantities for the Changma Dam, the new
conveyance canal and main intake, and the main canal systems in the three irrigation
areas have been completed by Gansu Water Resources Design Institute. Further
refinements to the Changma Dam design, incorporating the recommendations of the
international dam safety review panel and Bank missions, have also been completed for
preparation of international competitive bidding (ICB) bid documents to begin in early
1996. Designs for the main, secondary and tertiary canal systems in the three irrigation
areas are being undertaken simultaneously by the Yumen Water Conservancy Department
and Jiuquan Prefecture Water Conservancy Department. They will be completed
progressively in time for the scheduled construction. Design for the development of the
resettlement site for relocation of households affected by the Changma Reservoir has
been completed.
G. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
3.39  Due to its physical size, and the need for proper phasing and sequencing of
various components, the project will be implemented over a period of 10 years between
July 1996 to June 2006. Major items of construction work would be substantially
completed and disbursed within the first seven years. The Changma Dam and the
primary irrigation systems in the three irrigation districts are scheduled to be substantially
completed within the first four years. However, land development and settlement, on-
farm irrigation works, livestock and afforestation would be phased out over a period of 10
years. The project's detailed implementation schedule is shown in Figure 1. At



- 31 -
negotiations, assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that a detailed annual
budget and programs of works would be prepared and furnished to the BanklIDA by
November 30 of each year, for project implementation in the following year.
3.40 Reviews of the project implementation in meeting the development objectives and
target benefits would be conducted at the beginning of 2000 and 2003. The reviews
would include assessment of expenditures, revised project cost estimates, physical works
completed and outstanding, and targets achieved. The reviews would recommend
changes deemed necessary to complete the project. At negotiations, assurances were
obtained that Gansu Province would prepare and furnish information and data for
implementation reviews to be jointly conducted by Gansu and the Bank/IDA at the
beginning of 2000 and 2003, and Gansu would implement the measures agreed after
each review.
H. WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT
3.41  The female population in the host counties (Anxi and Yumen City) and among the
200,000 people from the 11 emigrating counties is estimated to be about 47 percent and
48.5 percent, of which those within the working age group of 15 to 59 years is 74 percent
and 63 percent. In both cases, the female population has a lower literacy level than the
male, especially the migrant females who have an illiteracy rate of about 90 percent
compared to 77 percent of the females in the host counties. Recent surveys show that
most of the females are engaged in simple and unskilled work, unable to compete with
males in the skilled and professional fields. Steeped in traditional social prejudice and
low self-esteem resulting from traditional culture, they are generally not motivated for
change, less adaptive to new environments, and deprived of social and economic
development opportunities unless special interventions are made to improve their status.
3.42  Under the project, special interventions targeted at the migrant female population
have been designed to change their social and economic status by promoting their
participation in social and economic development. These interventions include specific
targets for employment in the public and service sectors, construction industry, township
and village enterprises, and assistance in the development of small family-run businesses
and cottage industries. Women migrants will be given preference in obtaining credit
under the project's revolving fund specially created to assist new migrants (see para.
3.32). Details of targeted interventions are given in Annex F Table 6.
3.43  To equip the females for their participatory role in development, emphasis would
be laid on raising their literacy level through education and vocational training. Primary
and secondary schools would be built in the new settlement villages and townships to
ensure that migrant children (including girls) complete the fundamental education. Adult
females would be encouraged to attend adult education or vocational training classes to
learn practical skills or techniques so as to broaden their opportunities for work or
effective self-employment. About 4,000 females or one third of the migrant females to be
trained are expected to attend vocational training classes. The migrant females would



- 32 -
also be encouraged to join the Women's Federation (WF) to be established in each
village. The WFs would organize various socioeconomic activities for their members,
such as thrift and saving, home science, knowledge learning, literary and art groups, to
promote members' participation in social activities. This would gradually motivate the
females, give them more self-confidence, self-respect and decision-making in matters
affecting them.
I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
3.44  The environmental assessments were jointly completed by the Northwest
Investigation Design and Research Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power and the
Gansu Provincial Hydroelectricity Investigation and Design Institute of the Ministry of
Water Resources for Gansu Provincial Government, and reviewed and endorsed by the
National Environmental Protection Agency in July 1993. Based on the Bank's review
and recommendations during project preparation (September 1994) and preappraisal
(May 1995), the assessment reports were further refined and improved into a full
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Environmental Impact Summary (EIS)
submitted to the Bank in July 1995. The Gansu Provincial Government has released
these two environmental assessment documents to the public.
3.45  The environmental impact assessment studies have identified both adverse and
positive impacts. Due to its small component of involuntary resettlement of 131 families
involving 566 persons affected by the proposed Changma Reservoir, the project has been
classified a Category A project. A Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared in
accordance with the provision of Bank OD 4.30 (see paras. 3.48-3.50). The potential
negative impacts identified are: (a) the reclamation of some 10,100 ha of salinized soils
for cultivation upstream of the existing Shuangta Reservoir may increase the salinity
level of water in the reservoir as a result of draining the leachage into the reservoir;
(b) the interim changes to the groundwater regime (water levels, recharge, yield, quality)
resulting from higher regulation of the Shule River flow and water diversion for
irrigation. Other impacts are those associated with construction activities, public health
and fuel-energy demands for new migrant settlers. The positive impacts identified
include protection and enhancement of the existing fragile ecosystem through
afforestation, better and more rational use of land and water resources, and creation of
''oasis" effects leading to microclimate improvement.
3.46  Environmental rehabilitation of the source areas in the 11 emigrating counties
would be carried out by local governments after permanent emigration of selected
households to the new settlement areas. The rehabilitation measures, mainly related to
soil and water conservation, would include freezing and prohibition of cultivation of
steep slope land given up, afforestation, land terracing, planting of shrubs and grass, and
changing of cropping pattern with less emphasis on grains. Engineering measures, which
are more expensive, would be avoided or kept to a minimum. The proposed programs of
works and estimated costs for the 11 emigrating counties are summarized in Annex D
Table 4. A total of Y 13.5 million (base cost) has been provided under the project based



- 33 -
on an average estimated cost of Y 50,000 per km2 for similar works currently carried out
in Gansu.
3.47  Based on the discussion between the Bank and the project authority, an
Environmental Action Plan (EAP) has been prepared to mitigate the negative impacts and
to provide measures for both short- and long-term environmental protection and
management of the Shule River Basin. Details of the EAP are given in Annex D. The
EAP also includes basinwide environmental monitoring of land and water resources, and
institutional support and strengthening through provision of staff training, monitoring and
laboratory equipment, and vehicles.   During Bank supervision of the project
implementation, particular attention would be paid to the monitoring results of land
reclamation and salt leaching of salinized lands located upstream of the Shuangta
Reservoirs and it effect on the salinity level of water in the reservoir. At negotiations,
assurances were obtainedfrom Gansu Province that project activities will conform with
appropriate environmental practices; and Gansu Province would carry out the
Environmental Action Plan, monitor the annual programs and furnish the results
annually to the Bank/lIDA not later than March 31 of the following year.
J. LAND AcQuISITION AND INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT
3.48  Land Acquisition. Except for the acquisition of 172 ha of cultivated land to be
inundated by the proposed Changma Reservoir, there will be no land acquisition for work
construction in the new proposed irrigation area as the land is currently wasteland, barren
and uninhabited, belonging to the State. For improvement works in the existing irrigation
areas, some land would be required for the improvement and expansion works, but this
would be minimal as most of the canals and drains already have adequate reserves. No
houses or families will be affected as people only reside in villages, away from canals and
drains. The 172 ha of land in the Changma Reservoir will be acquired and compensated
under the RAP (para. 3.50 and Annex.E). Part of the compensation will be used by the
Yumen City government to develop alternative land for distribution to the relocatees for
cultivation in the settlement area located in the Huahai Irrigation Area.
3.49  Involuntary Resettlement. Construction of the proposed Changma Reservoir
will affect 131 families with a total population of 566 persons. The affected people
would be relocated and resettled on a 5,580 mu (373 ha) site in the Huahai Irrigation
Area. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in accordance with the
provisions of Bank's OD 4.30. A summary of the RAP is given in Annex E. The total
cost for compensation, relocation, resettlement and rehabilitation is estimated at Y 17.5
million (base cost) or about Y 30,900 per capita.'4 Under the RAP, each relocatee will
get 4.5 mu of land for cultivation and participate in the joint development and
management of 2,000 mu of commodity crops (fruits, hops, licorice, etc.). Each
14 This compares very favorably to compensation paid under other Bank-financed agricultural projects in
China.



- 34 -
household will get a housing plot of 635 m2 in the planned resettlement village complete
with basic infrastructure and amenities. The stakeholders participated in the selection of
various resettlement sites and general consensus was reached by the relocatees and the
host village nearby on the site selected. The relocation and resettlement will be carried
out in two phases; starting in 1998 and completing before the end of 1999 ahead of the
flooding of the Changma Reservoir in 2000. The socioeconomic well-being of the
relocatees will be monitored by the National Research Center for Resettlement (NRCR),
Hehai University, Nanjing for four to five years or until they are satisfactorily
rehabilitated.
3.50 At negotiations, assurances were obtained that Gansu Province would carry out
the relocation and resettlement of people affected by the Changma Reservoir according
to the Resettlement Action Plan approved by the Bank/lIDA, monitor annually the
progress and performance, and furnish the results to the Bank/IDA not later than March
31 of each year.
K. COST ESTIMATES
3.51  The total cost of the project is estimated at $259.2 million, of which the foreign
exchange component is $147 million, or 57 percent. Table 3.6 shows the project cost
summary and detailed cost estimates of various components are given in Annex B Tables
1 (a) to I (d).
3.52  Cost estimates have been derived by applying current unit prices to detailed
quantity estimates for the main components. Unit prices are based on recent prices for
similar works carried out in Gansu Province. Equipment costs are based on recent price
quotations and inquiry. Base costs are estimated with September 1995 prices. For costs
expressed in US dollars, the expected average price increase is estimated at 2.6 percent
for 1996-2005, and when the costs are expressed in Yuan the annual rates are
10.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 7.0 percent, 6.5 percent and 6.2 percent for 1996, 1997, 1998,
1999 and 2000-05. Physical contingencies of 5 percent have been applied to all items
except for the Changma Dam, for which 10 percent is allowed.

La Allocations from Ministry of Water Resources and State Planning Commission.
3.54   China is eligible for single currency loans under the Bank's expanded program. The
Government of China and Gansu Province have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single
currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign
exchange risk of their borrowing by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities
with their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They
selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full maturity of this loan,



- 36-
compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower
judges that it can manage any interest rate risk. This loan ($60 million), together with other
already approved FY loans, represents about 2.4 percent of the fiscal year 1996 IBRD
expected lending to China, and is well within the 50 percent volume guidelines approved by
the Bank's Board.
3.55   The loan of $60 million would be for 20 years, including a 5-year grace period at
the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans. The credit of
SDR 61.8 million ($90 million equivalent) would be on standard IDA terms with 35
years' maturity. The proceeds of the loan and credit would be made available to Gansu
Province for 20 years, including 5 years' grace for the Loan and 7 years' grace for the
Credit, with interest at the same rates charged by the Bank/IDA for the Loan and the
Credit.
M. PROCUREMENT
3.56   Project procurement will be based  on  the  Bank  Group's latest guidelines
"Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995" (revised January
1996). Gansu has retained the services of the International Tendering Company of the
China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation to carry out procurement
activities for the project. Table 3.7 summarizes the procurement arrangements.

3.57 Works. Civil works costing $10 million equivalent or more per contract will be
awarded under ICB. This will involve only one contract for the construction of Changma



- 37-
Dam with an estimated cost of $22.6 million. Qualified domestic bidders competing
under ICB civil works will be eligible for a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation, in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines on procurement. Contracts costing less than $10
million and more than $200,000 equivalent per contract will be awarded under NCB
procedures acceptable to the Bank/IDA. These civil works (estimated $77.3 million in
total value) comprise numerous packages of small structures, earthworks for canals and
drains, and buildings spread throughout the project area and would likely not be of
interest to foreign contractors who, however, will be allowed to bid in these NCB bids.
The remaining works with an estimated value of $93.9 million, mostly on-farm
earthworks for tertiary canals and drains, small structures, access roads, land reclamation,
afforestation, basic water and electric supplies, etc., are scattered over a wide area, labor
intensive and to be implemented over a 10-year timeframe. As such, they will be best
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of simplified procedures similar to
national shopping procedure with at least three price quotations (with less than $200,000
per contract and aggregate value of $45 million) and, with the prior agreement of the
Bank/IDA, force account works (up to $48.9 million total) using beneficiary labor
organized by local governments to participate in the project construction. Progress
payments for force account works would be based on unit prices and quantities agreed
annually with the Bank/IDA. Prequalification of bidders for all civil works costing $5
million or more per contract will be required. Prequalification of bidders for ICB bidding
of the Changma Dam will be advertised as a specific procurement notice in the United
Nations Development Business and/or well-known technical magazines, newspapers and
trade publications of wide international circulation.
3.58  Goods. All contracts for goods costing $200,000 equivalent or more will be
awarded under ICB. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped in
bid packages to cost $200,000 or more each. These contracts include construction and
agricultural  machinery,  vehicles,  turbine/generators,  transformers,  steel  bars,
communication and monitoring equipment, with an estimated total cost of $8.6 million.
Qualified domestic bidders competing under ICB will be eligible for a preference in bid
evaluation of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price or the actual custom duties and import tax,
whichever is less. The remainder, mostly small items of office machinery, laboratory and
workshop equipment, cement and timber would be procured through NCB procedures
acceptable to the Bank/IDA with an estimated total value of $6.0 million. Building
materials and production inputs for settlers spread out in 160 new villages (aggregate
value $13.7 million), a small quantity of machinery, equipment, miscellaneous
instruments (aggregate value $2.0 million), and livestock and forestry production
materials (aggregate value $2.5 million) will be procured using national shopping (with at
least three price quotations) for procurement under $50,000 per contract and international
shopping (with at least three quotations from at least two different countries) for
procurement between $50,000 and $100,000 per contract. The aggregate value for
national and international shopping will not exceed $3.0 million and $1.5 million,
respectively, for livestock and forestry production materials, machinery, equipment and
instruments.

3.59 Design, Supervision and Management. Engineering surveys and designs would
be carried out by local design institutes at provincial and prefecture levels on direct
contract basis. In addition to department supervision, individual engineering consultants
would be employed to assist in the supervision of major works. The project management
element will cover operating costs for office facilities and equipment, vehicles,
monitoring and evaluation systems. The aggregate cost has been estimated at $5 million
for surveys and designs, consultant supervision $1 million, and project management $3.7
million. Only $6.7 million of the total $9.7 million will be Bank-financed.
3.60 Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. Bid documents"5 for all civil works
in excess of $2.0 million and goods in excess of $200,000 will be subject to prior review
by the Bank/IDA. This will cover the ICB contract for the Changma Dam (para. 3.58)
and 17 NCB contracts for works ($54 million in value), and 15 contracts for goods ($14.4
million in value). The prior review of bid documents will cover 77 percent of all contract
value for civil works and more than 90 percent of contract value for goods. The slight
lower review coverage than the target 80 percent for works is due to large number of low
value packages of earthworks and small structures normally associated with irrigation
project. These small packages would be more efficiently carried out by small local
contractors at county and township levels. Beside supporting and promoting local
construction industry and participatory work by project stakeholders, the timely
completion of these small packages of works would bring project benefits on stream with
completion of each package of works. Standard Bidding Documents with standard
Special Conditions prepared and issued by the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with
the Bank/IDA, would be used for ICB and NCB. All other contracts will be subject to
selective review after bid awards. Annex B Table 2 shows procurement packaging and
scheduling of major items of works and goods by ICB and NCB contracts.
3.61  Technical Assistance and Training.  The selection and engagement of
consultants to carry out the technical assistance programs will be based on the Bank's
"Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as
Executing Agency-August 1981." The World Bank's Standard Form of Contract for
Consultants' Services will be used and prior review of consultant service contracts by the
Bank/IDA would be required for contracts with an estimated cost of $100,000 or more for
firms and $50,000 or more for individuals. In addition, terms of reference and sole-
source selection of consultants, regardless of the value of the consultancy contract, are
subject to the Bank's prior review. All reimbursable training will be based on programs
agreed with the Bank/IDA.
N. DISBURSEMENT
3.62  The proceeds of the Bank Loan/IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:
I5 Including prequalification, notice of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid evaluation and
recommendations, and contracts.

3.63   To  accelerate and facilitate construction  of the main  Changma Dam, and
involuntary resettlement of households affected by the Changma Reservoir, retroactive
financing of construction works effective from October 1, 1995 will be required for the
following: (a) construction of temporary works and facilities covering access roads,
electricity and communication to the dam site; (b) improvement and expansion of the
irrigation facilities in the Huahai Irrigation Area of the 5,580 mu resettlement site so that
relocation and resettlement of families affected by the Changma Reservoir can be carried
out early; and (c) construction of two branch canals, and a portion of Anxi North Main
Canal, to serve pilot settlement areas. The total disbursable amount would be SDR 3.43
million ($5.0 million equivalent) as detailed in the work programs in Annex B Table 4
reviewed and approved by the Bank/IDA.
3.64   Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) will be used for disbursements to be made
against (a) works under contracts costing less than $2,000,000 equivalent each (which
includes all force account works); (b) goods under contracts costing less than $200,000
equivalent each; (c) training and study tours; (d) consultants' services under contracts
awarded to firms costing less than $100,000 equivalent each and consultants' services
contracts awarded to individuals costing less than $50,000 equivalent each; and

works are to be supported by progress reports showing physical quantities and unit prices,
the latter to be reviewed and updated annually and agreed by the Bank/IDA.
3.65   To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account, to be operated by the existing
Gansu World Bank Projects Implementation Office (GPIO) under the Gansu Bureau of



- 40 -
Finance, will be established in a bank acceptable to the Bank/IDA. The Special Account
will have an initial authorized allocation of $6 million equivalent, which will be increased
to $10 million when the cumulative disbursement amount reaches SDR 30 million. GPIO
will prepare and submit applications for disbursement and replenishment of the Special
Account monthly or whenever the account is drawn down to half its initial amount,
whichever comes first. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2006 and to
close on December 31, 2006. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex
a Table 5. The disbursement schedule is slower than the historical profile for water
resources and agricultural projects in China, due to the nature of the project. It is closer
to that of land settlement projects in China and other competent borrowing countries.
0. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS
3.66 The Shule River Basin Project Management Bureau (PMB) will maintain records
of all project expenditures. These records will be forwarded regularly to GPIO, which
will review and consolidate the accounts of expenditure and submit them to the
Bank/IDA for disbursement. GPIO has proposed that the State Audit Administration
through its Gansu Provincial Bureau of Audit will audit the project accounts; this
auditing arrangement is acceptable to the Bank/IDA. The audited accounts will also
include the Special Account and the details on withdrawals from the Loan/Credit account
made on the basis of SOEs, and the auditor's opinion as to whether such withdrawals
were made against expenditures eligible for disbursement by the Bank/IDA. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that it will maintain
consolidated project accounts, which will be audited by an independent auditor, and
submit such audited accounts to the Bank/lIDA within six months of the close of each
financial year.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION
4.1   The Shule River Basin Project Management Bureau (PMB), established at Yumen
Township, will have overall responsibility for project implementation and management
under the guidance of the existing Gansu World Bank Projects Implementation
Commission (GWBPIC), and Gansu Bureau of Water Resources (GBWR) which has
been designated as the owner and principal agency to oversee the project implementation
and provide technical guidance. A Vice Governor in charge of agriculture has been
designated to oversee the Hexi Corridor Project. The existing Gansu World Bank
Projects Implementation Office (GPIO) in the Gansu Bureau of Finance, serving as an
executive arm of GWBPIC, will assume overall financial responsibility in project
funding, including applying for reimbursement of project expenditures from the
Bank/IDA. The general organization of the project is shown in Chart 1.
4.2   PMB, with status of a provincial bureau, will have eight departments: general
administration; finance; engineering and infrastructure; settlement and social services;
agroeconomic development; monitoring and evaluation; procurement and supplies, and a
representative office in Lanzhou. The total staff establishment is estimated at 100
persons. Three advisory or consultative bodies would also be established to advise PMB
on project implementation specifics. These bodies are:
(a)   Panel of Experts.  The panel would consist of senior experienced
technical experts, reputed institutions of higher learning, and research
centers, within Gansu Province or in the country, of various disciplines to
advise PMB on specific technical issues or problems as the needs arise.
PMB would maintain a list of panel experts and institutions updated
periodically.
(b)   Local Government Consultative Committee (LGCC).  Comprising
local government representatives from Jiuquan Prefecture, Yumen City
and Township, and Anxi County, LGCC will meet regularly with PMB for
consultation on project proposals for their respective constituents, exercise
the participatory role and provide the contribution required by and of the
constituent governments in project implementation. The LGCC will also
liaise closely with county/city project leading groups and project
management offices on the land settlement programs.
(c)   Settlement Advisory and Coordination Committee (SACC). The land
settlement of 54,600 ha newly irrigated land with 200,000 persons would
involve 11 emigrating counties from central and southeast Gansu and the



- 42 -
hosts-Yumen City and Township, Anxi County and Jiuquan Prefecture.
To ensure a participatory role of the stakeholders in the successful
emigration and settlement, SACC, comprising representatives from
provincial bureaus of Civil Affairs, Ethnic Affairs, Poverty Alleviation
and State Farms, Lanzhou University, local governmnent representatives
from Jiuquan, Ganan, Dingxi, Linxia and Longnan prefectures, the 11
emigrating counties and the host Anxi County and Yumen City
governments in Hexi, will advise PMB and its Settlement and Social
Services Department on the detailed planning, design and program
implementation of the land settlement component. For impartiality, the
SACC would be chaired by a person nominated by Gansu Provincial
Government, and assisted by two vice chairmen, one representing the
emigrating county governments and the other the host governments in
Hexi. Each chairman of the 11 County Emigration and Settlement
Leading Groups (CESLG) will be a member of the SACC.
(d)   County Emigration and Settlement Leading Group (CESLG). Each of
the 11 emigrating counties would establish a CESLG chaired by the
county or deputy county chief with heads of the township emigration/
settlement groups as members. The CESLGs would: (i) plan and oversee
implementation of the emigration/settlement programs carried out by the
county Settlement Offices; (ii) approve settler households processed and
recommended by the Village Settlement Groups and township
governments; (iii) coordinate, through SACC, with PMB the annual
budgets and programs for emigration and settlement, and the follow-up on
the welfare of those emigrated and settled; and (iv) plan and oversee
rehabilitation and restoration of the environmentally degraded areas after
the people have emigrated.
(e)   Project Implementation Leading Groups (PILGs). At city, county and
state farm level, PILGs would be established to organize and oversee
implementation of project works and activities contracted with PMB. The
PILGs would liaise closely with LGCC and SACC on their needs in
formulating the annual plan and work programs to be prepared by PMB.
The PILGs would be assisted by respective project management offices to
be established.
4.3   The PMB, Panel of Experts, LGCC, SACC, CESLGs and PILGs were established
prior to project negotiations. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
Gansu Province that these entities would be maintained with terms of reference, staffing
and other resources acceptable to the Bank/IDA.



- 43 -
B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
4.4   Flow of Bank/IDA Funds. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Borrower would make the proceeds of the Bank Loan and IDA Credit available to Gansu
Province for 20 years including 5 years' grace for the Loan and 7 years for the Credit
with interest at the same rates charged by the BanklIDA for the Loan and the Credit.
Gansu Provincial Government has designated Gansu Provincial Bureau of Water
Resources (GBWR) as the "owner" of the project to be responsible for the cost recovery,
repayment of Bank loan and credit, and the foreign exchange risk. Part of the Bank/IDA
funds will be paid directly to contractors for civil works and suppliers of goods under
ICB contracts on request by GPIO. A small portion of funds will be used to cover the
costs of training and technical assistance. The remaining funds will be disbursed against
local expenditures for civil works, on-farm works, land reclamation and settlement,
livestock, afforestation and goods procured locally through NCB, force account works
and shopping.
4.5   Sources and Flow of Domestic Funds. Domestic funds, which will finance
about 42 percent of the project costs, will be contributed by various sources as
sunmmarized in Annex B Table 11. Project beneficiaries will also contribute both self-
raised funds and labor for earthwork construction. Understandings were obtained from
the Borrower and Gansu Province that these sources of domestic funds are firm and
committed.
4.6   Terms and Conditions of Bank Loan/IDA Credit. A Project Agreement will be
signed between the Bank/IDA and Gansu Province incorporating the above agreements.
C. EXECUTION AND SUPERVISION OF PROJECT WORKS
4.7   Execution. Planning, designs and execution of major civil works contracts on
Changma Dam, New Trunk Canal and the main canal extension and improvements in the
three irrigation areas will be undertaken by Gansu Bureau of Water Resources (GBWR)
through a full-time unit responsible to PMB. Other civil works including on-farm
facilities will be executed by Yumen Township Water Conservancy Department
(YTWCD) coordinated by this unit.  Similarly, crop production, livestock and
afforestation will be executed by the provincial/prefecture/county technical bureaus and
departments concerned and coordinated by project units under PMB. The land settlement
will be executed by the respective existing county settlement offices in the I I emigrating
counties, Anxi County and Yumen City, and coordinated by the Settlement and Social
Services Division (SSSD) under PMB.
4.8   Supervision. Day-to-day supervision of project works will be accomplished by
implementing departments.  For Changma Dam, GBWR will engage consultants
acceptable to the Bank/IDA to assist GBWR in the supervision of civil works
construction under ICB contract. To supplement the Bank/IDA supervision, PMB will,
from time to time, engage local experts from the Panel of Experts to supervise the
progress of various project components.  PMB  will furnish the findings and



- 44 -
recommendations of these experts to the Bank/IDA. The respective provincial technical
bureaus/departments will undertake supervision of works based on annual work programs
planned and agreed by PMB. SSSD, in collaboration with CESLGs, will supervise the
annual emigration and settlement programs to be executed by the county settlement
offices.
D. PROJECT LAUNCH WORKSHOP
4.9   To facilitate project implementation, the Bank/IDA in collaboration with the
Ministry of Finance will conduct a project launch workshop in Lanzhou in May 1996 for
the staff of GPIO, PMB and project county/city implementing agencies. The objectives
of the workshop will be to clarify the role and responsibilities of PMB and its various
departments, and entities of local governments in project implementation. Other topics to
be included will be: (a) procurement (based on the new guidelines of January 1995) and
disbursement; (b) project accounts and annual auditing; (c) monitoring and evaluation;
and (d) recordkeeping and reporting.  Experienced staff from other Bank-financed
projects would be invited to the workshop to share their experience.
E. EMIGRATION AND LAND SETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT
4.10  Effective and efficient management will be needed to ensure successful
emigration and settlement of the planned 200,000 people. PMB, in consultation with
SACC, CESLG and LGCC, will plan detailed annual emigration and settlement programs
based on the approved Land Settlement Master Plan for approval by GWBPIC. The
approved programs will then be suballocated to the respective emigrating counties for
execution by the county settlement offices. PMB, through its SSSD and the Monitoring
and Evaluation Division, will supervise and monitor the implementation progress. For
implementation coordination between the 11 emigrating counties and the host county/city
of Anxi and Yumen, PMB will resolve any issues jointly through meetings held at regular
intervals with SACC, CESLG and LGCC. To strengthen SSSD under PMB, some
experienced staff from the Two Xi Commission will be seconded to SSSD to form its
core staff. The overall organizational and management structure for emigration and land
settlement is shown in Chart 2.
F. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PROJECT WORKS
4.11  A new Shule River Basin Water Resources Management Bureau (SRWRMB) will
be established at Yumen Township not later than December 31, 1998 to be responsible
for the overall basinwide water resource planning, development, operation and
management in the Shule River Basin. SRWRMB will be established by Gansu
Provincial Government and given appropriate regulatory power under the Water Laws.
This is to ensure efficient water control and dispatch of the main and secondary irrigation
systems transcending county administrative boundaries. The existing three operation and
maintenance (O&M) offices, the Anxi County Water Conservancy Office operating and
maintaining the Shuangta Irrigation Area, the Yumen City Office for the Huahai
Irrigation Area, and the Shule River Irrigation Management Office operating the trunk



- 45 -
canals and the Changma Irrigation Area, will be consolidated and placed under
SRWRMB. The proposed new organizational structure for operation and maintenance is
shown in Chart 3. SRWRMB will prepare a plan for the overall O&M of the completed
irrigation works covering the three irrigation areas and submit the plan to the Bank/IDA
for review not later than December 31, 1999, and carry out O&M of the irrigation works
based on the operation and maintenance plan reviewed and agreed by the Bank/IDA.
4.12  To provide an effective means for efficient irrigation water control, dispatch and
management, a monitoring system will be constructed with a network of telemetricJ
communication stations covering the whole irrigation area to collect and transmit data to
the center in SRWRMB for computerized simulation (or optimization) of control and
distribution of irrigation water. This monitoring system would play a major role in
assisting management in deriving decision rules for operation of the irrigation system and
for drought crisis management. Details of the system are summarized in Annex G.
4.13  To sustain the required operation and maintenance of irrigation works, annual
water fees will be collected from the users in the project area. Current irrigation water
rates range from Y 0.015 to Y 0.03 per m3. Based on the projected production cost per
unit of water, these rates would be revised after 1999, taking into consideration the
inflationary increase in cost, and to be imposed upon completion of irrigation facilities in
each main canal command area. The revenue collected is expected to cover at least the
full annual operation and maintenance costs, but not the depreciation costs.
4.14  At negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom Gansu Province that SRWPMB
will (a) be established not later than December 31, 1998 with terms of reference, staffing
and other resources acceptable to the Bank/IDA; (b) prepare and submit to the Bank/IDA
a plan for operation and maintenance of the whole irrigation area for review not later
than December 31, 1999 and carry out the required annual operation and maintenance
for the completed irrigation works, taking into account the Bank's/IDA's comments;
(c) collect irrigation water rates upon completion of irrigation facilities in each main
canal command area at levels adequate to meet at least the full annual operation and
maintenance costs of completed irrigation works and the cost of replacing their
structures; and (d) furnish to the Bank./IDA not later than December 31, 1999, the
proposed schedule of such water rates to be established and collected.
G. MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES
4.15  Technical supervision of livestock, forestry and agroforestry production would be
provided by supervising units or groups to be established within the bureaus concerned at
county and township levels under the guidance of prefecture and provincial departrnents.
PMB would oversee and monitor the progress and performance of the agreed annual
programs.



- 46 -
H. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING
4.16 The monitoring of project performance and impact has been discussed with Gansu
Province. A Monitoring and Evaluation Division (MED) will be established under PMB
to coordinate the monitoring and evaluation of the project's progress, performance and
impacts of various subcomponents to be carried out by assigned technical departments.
There will be three subprograms for monitoring and evaluation (see below) by assigned
technical departments. In addition, MED will undertake the overall monitoring of
physical and financial progress of project implementation and prepare consolidated
reports for submission to project management and the Bank. Project staff in MED would
be trained on the collection of data, their analysis and evaluation, and reporting.
(a)   Involuntary Resettlement for Changma Reservoir:  The National
Research Center for Resettlement (NRCR) of Hehai University in
Nanjing, in collaboration with Gansu Design Institute, will monitor and
evaluate annually the socioeconomic well-being of 131 families (566
persons) relocated by the construction of the Changma Reservoir and
resettled in the Huahai Irrigation Area. The monitoring and evaluation
would be initially for four to five years or until the relocatees have
achieved at least current livelihood levels. MED will coordinate with
NRCR for the timely monitoring and dissemination of findings, which will
be forwarded directly to the Bank, and recommendations for any follow-
up action required by the project management.
(b)   Voluntary Emigration and Land Settlement: Over a 10-year period of
settlement implementation, the Population Research Institute of Northwest
China, Lanzhou University will undertake the monitoring and evaluation
of the new migrants settled in the project area. An aggregate of 10 percent
of the migrant households will be surveyed each year. Results will be
forwarded directly to MED and the Bank. More details of the monitoring
parameters and targets are given in Annex F. The monitoring and
evaluation would not only establish a comprehensive database of the
migrant settlers and provide valuable information on socioeconomic
impacts, but also identify any specific deficiencies in the settlement
programs affecting the settlers.   This would enable the project
management to take timely remedial actions or to design improvements to
the programs for the coming years.
(c)   Environmental Monitoring of Land & Water Resources: A long-term
basinwide eco-environmental monitoring will be carried out by existing
county, city and prefecture environmental protection agencies in the Hexi
Corridor, supported by local specialist consultants, to evaluate the long-
term impacts on land and water resources, and the ecosystem, resulting
from implementation of the project. Details of the monitoring are given in
Annex D on the Environmental Action Plan.  The project would



- 47 -
strengthen and support the institutional capacity and capability of various
local environmental units to carry out the monitoring and analytical work.
(d)   Physical and Financial Progress of Project Implementation: MED will
collate progress reports from the respective technical bureaus and units
implementing the project components to compile into the overall physical
and financial progress report for the project. Physical reports will include
quantities of work completed, as well as machinery, equipment and
materials procured and used. Financial reports will detail all project
expenditures, amount and value of contributed labor, and supporting
documents for disbursement from Loan/Credit proceeds. MED will
compile the progress report semiannually for review by PMB and
subsequent submission to the Bank through GPIO by July 31 and January
31 of each year, for the previous half-year periods.
4.17  The monitoring of performance indicators and impacts for the above four
monitoring programs are given in Annex H. At negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Gansu Province that it would: (a) carry out periodic monitoring of project
performance and impacts based on indicators discussed, and furnish the results to the
Bank/IDA at agreed intervals; and (b) prepare andfurnish to the Bank/IDA semiannual
reports of the project's physical and financial progress by July 31 and January 31 of
each year, for the previous half-year periods.

5. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES
A. PRODUCTION
5.1   Crop production is expected to increase significantly by the time the project
reaches its full development year (beginning Year 18) due to improved and expanded
irrigation and drainage facilities, increase in irrigated area and improved agricultural
support services. The incremental cropped areas and production of various crops are
given in Annex C Table 3(a) to 3(d).
5.2   The total grain production is projected to increase from 111,040 tons (without
project) to 315,480 tons (with project) with an increment of 204,440 tons or 184 percent
of the without-project scenario. Major increases in commodity crop production projected
include: 6,875 tons cotton, 8,220 tons oil crops, 46,800 tons sugarbeet, 2,635 tons black
melon seed, 42,100 tons melons, 34,230 tons various vegetables, and 1,010 tons hops.
The total incremental production value is estimated at Y 584 million; Y 313 million for
grain crops and Y 271 million for commodity crops. The increased production of various
crops would also provide substantial increase in crop residues and forage (Y 72 million in
value), which would be used as coarse feed for livestock production.
5.3   The main incremental annual livestock products projected at full development
(beginning Year 22) are: 40 tons alfalfa seed, 126,650 tons alfalfa hay, 820,680 broiler/
layer chicken, 1,010 tons commercial egg, 676,000 egg for hatching layer chicks, 2.1 tons
wool, and seed stock of 32,600 chicks, 124 calves, 686 sheep, 3,010 breeding pigs and
20,100 piglets. The total output value is estimated at about Y 59.3 million.
5.4   The forestry and agroforestry component would produce annually about 14,440
tons of fuelwood during Year 1-10, 16,220 tons (commencing about year 15) and 24,780
tons at full development (Year 26), 2 million saplings for nursery, 71,230 poplar poles,
25,000 m3 of timber (commencing about Year 20) and about 62,670 tons of fruits
(commencing about Year 10), with a total value of Y 99.6 million against current output
value of about Y 3.0 million.
B. MARKETS
5.5   As Gansu Province is deficit in grain production, the increased grain production
will be absorbed by local markets within the province to offset about three fifths of the
projected foodgrain deficit. Currently, China produces only about 4.0 million tons of
cotton to meet her demand of about 5.0 million tons, and Gansu produces 18,000 tons
against demand of 23,000 tons. The increased production of 6,875 tons cotton under the
project would be completely procured by the State. The increased production of 46,800
tons of sugarbeet would be processed by the surplus processing capacity within the
province to meet national and provincial shortages of sugar, currently estimated at about



- 49 -
700,000 tons. Hops (particularly in pelletized form) is in big demand by overseas and
local beer breweries. The increased production of hops will be readily absorbed by the
local and national markets. The increased production of livestock and forestry products
would be absorbed mainly by local markets in the project area and within the province.
5.6   The existing marketing channels operated by the national commerce departments,
supply and marketing cooperatives, supplemented by cooperatives, household groups and
individual traders, offer very competitive markets for agricultural produce. Farmers
would be able to obtain market prices, and this would provide incentives for increased
production. The future market in the project area is expected to expand with the
improvement of the transportation network, especially the National Highway No. 312 and
the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Dual-track Railway passing through the project area.
C. PRICES
5.7    At present the prices of agricultural products in the project area, except for cotton
and tobacco, are free-market prices or coexist with a free-market price.  State
procurement prices consist of a ceiling and floor guaranteed price. In general, all direct
government subsidies have been eliminated.
5.8   In Hexi Corridor output prices have risen steadily for the past several years. From
1985 to 1993, the crop purchasing price index rose 73, 74, 82 and 117 percent for grain,
oil, cotton, and vegetables, respectively. From 1993 to 1994 the official guaranteed price
rose about 25 percent for grain (Y0.8/kg to Y 1/kg), and 21.1 percent for cotton
(Y 6.6/kg to Y 8/kg). The unit prices of vegetables, fruits, and meats also increased.
Recent increases brought the official grain price close to the local open-market price, and
also close to world prices adjusted to the farm level. Local market prices in 1995 have
been increased about 23 percent for wheat (Y 1.3/kg to Y 1.6/kg), 50 percent for cotton
(Y 8/kg to Y 12/kg), 30 percent for melon seed, and 30 percent for beets from 1994.
Prices are expected to continue rising due to the higher incomes and demand in the
project area and surrounding industrial and urban growth centers.
5.9   Presently, farrners procure inputs at market prices. These prices are about 15-25
percent higher than the formerly subsidized prices. From 1993 to 1994 the price rose
about 29 percent for urea, 14 percent for phosphate fertilizer, and 30 percent for
agricultural chemicals. In 1995 the price for nitrogen fertilizer increased by about 29
percent from 1994 in the project area.
5.10  Prices Used in Analysis. Input and output prices used in the crop budgets for
financial analysis of the project components are either 1995 average free-market prices or
official prices, and are based on data provided by the project authorities. These prices are
summarized in Annex C Table 1. For economic analysis, World Bank commodity price
projections have been used to calculate the farm-gate value of wheat, maize, soybean,
cotton, chicken, pork, and urea, with appropriate adjustments for domestic and
international transport and handling costs. The economic value of most other farm inputs
and outputs was considered either equivalent to the financial price or adjusted by the
standard conversion factor. Detailed calculations are shown in Annex C Table 2.



- 50 -
6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. BENEFITS
6.1   The most important of all benefits is the alleviation of absolute poverty of
200,000 poor farmers from subsistence farming to self-sufficiency in food and basic
needs, and then ultimately to become moderate- to high-income farmers. The migrant
households would also enjoy better standards of living and higher quality of life in the
new settlements.'6
6.2   The increased production of foodgrain, commodity crops and livestock products
(Annex&..  Table 3a-3e) will ease current shortages in the Province, especially of
foodgrain, import of which will be reduced by three-fifths. With emigration and
settlement on the newly irrigated land, the 200,000 poor farmers would be self-sufficient
in food and basic needs, and no longer dependent on government relief. With the out-
migration there would be reduction of population pressure on marginal land in source
areas and this would facilitate more rational use of natural resources and higher
productivity per capita. The other significant intangible benefit is the protection and
enhancement of the fragile eco-environmental system of the projec, area through the
planned afforestation and rational use of land and water resources.
6.3   The project would generate a total of about 112.3 GWh/year hydroelectric power,
which would be fed into the local grid to alleviate the current power shortages. The
Changma Reservoir would increase the industrial water supply to 83 Mm3/year. The
project would also stimulate and promote economic growth in the two project counties
through creation of 16 new townships and 160 villages to accommodate the 200,000
migrant population. The projected agricultural production, including that of livestock and
forestry, would turn the project area into a major grain and commodity crops production
base in the province, providing the essential raw materials for township and village
enterprises, and generating employment opportunities in the service sector as well.
B. EMPLOYMENT AND INCOMES
6.4   Employment. During project implementation, some 29.6 million worker-days
would be required for the construction of Changma Dam and the irrigation systems; 17.5
million for land settlement; 1.7 million for agricultural development; and 3.0 million for
other activities. The required labor would be provided mainly by the new migrant settlers
16 While all costs of migration and settlement have been included in rate of return calculations of the
project, no benefits of improved housing and social services for settlers have been quantified.



- 51 -
and the local population, and the rest from other neighboring counties and within the
province. Some skilled workers will be provided by construction contractors from
outside the province. After the project is completed, some 14 million worker-days of
regular employment would be created; 12 million in crop production and agricultural
support services; 0.7 million in livestock production; 1.0 million in forestry and
agroforestry; 0.3 million in operation and maintenance of irrigation and power systems.
Numerous undetermined jobs would also be created by rural, township and village
enterprises in the new 16 townships and 160 villages to be created by land settlement.
6.5   Incomes. Per capita incomes of the majority of the households from the 11
emigrating counties are currently below the poverty line (Y 400 per capita income),
varying from Y 188 to Y 365 (see Annex F Table 2) with an overall average of Y 290 for
the 11 counties, below the absolute poverty level of Y 300. The farm model analysis
shows substantial increase in migrants' income with the comprehensive improvement in
irrigation and drainage, crop, livestock and forestry production, and agricultural support
and agrimachinery service. Several items have been considered to calculate and assess
the impacts on typical household income, such as various incremental taxes (agricultural
tax, special product tax and fee, etc.); the project loan repayment (including farmer labor
contribution requirement allocated to each household); and an incremental water charge
that will cover the full operation and maintenance costs for the new and rehabilitated
irrigation and drainage system. Charges for additional (1.5 to 2 mu per capita) leased
cultivated land will be waived for the first three years. It will be charged at Y 50/mu in
the fourth through sixth years and Y 100/mu following the seventh year after
immigration. The standard charge for these items is presented in the typical household
farm model (see Annex C Table 4).
6.6    Many farm households were surveyed in the project area to represent typical
beneficiary families. The representative farm households were selected in three irrigation
areas based on specialized livestock production, and crop production technologies with
different cropping area. Three counties were selected among the 11 emigrating counties
to derive detailed income and expenditure data in the model: Jishishan, representing a
minority area, cold climate, high altitude, and a relatively high income; Lixian, also
representing a cold climate and high altitude but with mid-level income for this poverty
area; and Yongjin, representing an arid, centrally located, relatively poor area. The net
incomes of migrant households who adopted improved or new technologies under the
project would increase substantially. The farm models indicate that the project would
increase farm household income from Y 729-1,382 currently to Y 4,884-4,897 in year 10
in Changma, Y 1,600 to Y 6,500 in Shuangta, and Y 12,000 to Y 15,900 in Huahai."7 In
addition, migrant household income with specialized livestock production will increase
from Y 1,357 to Y 8,144 with cattle production, and Y 12,592 with sheep production
17 The higher incomes referred to relocatees from Changma village to Huahai new irrigation area affected
by the construction of the Changma Reservoir. Their present incomes are comparatively high due to
incomes derived from rearing of large herds of livestock.

6.7    The summary table of migrant household net incomes in each subproject area is
presented in Annex C Table 5.   It shows the annual average real growth rate of
household income at 3 to 25 percent through year 10, and 3.3 to 14 percent through year
20 for various forms of specialized production.
C. COST RECOVERY AND REPAYMENT
6.8    Cost recovery for the project will take several forms. Farners will pay the full
cost of some agricultural inputs and services, i.e., seeds, tree saplings, livestock,"8
agricultural machinery services. The investment cost in irrigation will be recovered
through labor contributions for construction, operation and maintenance, and through
increases in irrigation water charges (para. 4.13) to meet at least the full annual O&M
costs.
6.9    The Gansu Government proposes to recover some capital costs from the migrant
settlers through rent for lease of an additional 1.5 to 2 mu per capita of newly developed
irrigated land (para. 3.27). The rent amount is estimated at Y 1.5 billion for 370,000 mu
over a 20-year period. The net increase in agricultural taxes'9 (comprising normal
agricultural tax plus 8 percent tax of local product value) at full development is projected
to be about Y 23.65 million/year. Part of this additional revenue (60 percent) will be
used for project repayment. The estimated Y 60/year/person saving by provincial
government on reduction of poverty interventions and providing grain and other social
relief to 200,000 people as a result of emigration and settlement would amount to about
Y 120 million over a 10-year period. This amount would also be used for loan/credit
repayment.
D. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES
Financial Analysis
6.10   Financial analyses for the principal components were based on detailed crop
budgets prepared for the annual and perennial crops, reflecting representative scenarios in
each component and subproject. Selected crop budgets for wheat, corn and cotton are
given in Annex C Table 6a to 6e. Given the price and cost structures in each subproject
area, as well as the objective of the project, rates of return for all components are
acceptable. The FIRRs on individual components ranged from 12.1 (Changma Irrigation
18 The veterinary service charges proposed are:
(a) Epidemic Prevention: Sheep/goat Y 1.50/head, pig Y 1.0/head, chicken Y 0.10/bird;
(b) Diagnosis/Treatment: Large animal Y 1.50/head, Small animal Y 1.0/head;
(c) Castration: Horse Y 20/head; Cattle Y 15/head; Sow/Boar Y 1.5-Y 1.0/head; Sheep/Goat Y 1.0/head;
(d) Insemination: Cattle Y 30/head; Pig Y 15/head; Sheep/Goat Y 1.50/head.

Area) to 26.2 percent (Parent Layer Chicks Farm). The overall irrigation/drainage
component FIRR is 15.6; ranging from 12.1 in Changma to 17.2 in Shuangta and to 12.3
percent in Huahai.
6.11  The FIRR on forestry components ranged from 12.5 to 21 percent, depending on
the kind of trees. The fuelwood forest is 13.3 percent, nursery 16.6 percent, and orchard
21 percent, while the lowest rate, 12.5 percent, occurs for planting of protection forestry.
The latter does not always pay in the short run, although it is a critical element in the
comprehensive protection and conservation of the ecosystem.
6.12  The FIRR for the grassland and livestock subproject is 19.6 percent, 18.7 percent
is for pasture improvement, 17.9 percent for forage seed production base, 24.4 percent for
the livestock production base, 12.5 to 16.2 percent for lean pork and sow breeding farms,
and 26.2 to 14.3 percent for poultry (layer/broiler) breeding farms. The detailed tables
showing financial rates of return are attached in Annex C Table 7a and 7b.
Assumptions for Economic Analysis
6.13  Economic analysis was done on the major components (irrigation and drainage,
forestry, grassland and livestock) and for the project as a whole. World Bank price
projections or export prices actually realized in China were used to estimate farm-gate
prices in 1995 constant terms for traded inputs and outputs. The standard conversion
factor of I was applied to all nontraded items. Conversion factors for investment cost
items are listed in Annex C Table 8. All economic values were converted to local
currency at the prevailing official exchange rate of Y 8.4 to $1.0, and a discount rate of
12 percent was used to approximate the opportunity cost of capital in China. All project
costs, including project investment and production costs, working capital and physical
contingencies, have been considered in estimating the economic costs of the project, but
price contingencies, interest, and taxes were omitted.
Economic and Sensitivity Analysis
6.14  Based on the above assumptions and comparing costs and benefits over a period
of 30 years, the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for selected components range
between 18.2 percent (for irrigation and drainage component) to 29.1 percent (for
livestock development component), depending on the assumed cropping and activity
pattern, the size of the irrigation and planted area, and the investment cost.  The
estimation of economic costs and benefits of the project accounted for  project
investment, migrants' subsidies, farm production cost, and all incremental migrant
household income from crop, forestry, and livestock production. The overall project
EIRR is 18.8 percent with a net present value of about Y 774.1 million (Annex C
Table 9). The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Table 6.1. If the
assumed crop yields take 10 years (instead of 7 years) to reach stable stage, the overall
EIRR will be reduced to 17.1 percent with a net present value of Y 587.4 million (see
Table 6.2).



- 54 -
6.15  Sensitivity analysis of the ERRs for each of the project components was carried
out with switching values to identify levels at which the project would become
economically nonviable, and how far the total costs including the operation input cost and
investment cost could rise or benefits (the yield or output price) could fall. Table 6.1
shows that the overall project is not rendered unprofitable by significant changes in cost
or benefits. Benefits will need to be 26 percent lower than estimated or incremental
costs 34 percent higher before the EIRR will fall to 12 percent. The detailed
sensitivity analyses can be found in the project files.
E. RIsKS
6.16  The project risks have been identified and analyzed. Measures have also been
incorporated in the project to minimize their effect. The major risks associated with the
project are:
(a)   potential increased salinity in the Shuangta Reservoir water due to
leaching and drainage from accelerating upstream reclamation of salinized
land;
(b)   natural disasters of drought, scorching heat waves and sand storms;
(c)   delay in achieving the stable crop yields assumed at the eighth year for
reclaimed land;
(d)   reduced benefits from lower canal system efficiency; and
(e)   delay of project implementation due to slow and poor performance of land
settlement, and lack of inadequate institutional and financial support.
These risks were evaluated with sensitivity analyses on a variety of data and assumptions
required for the estimation of EIRR. The results shows that, even with consideration of
the risks mentioned above, the estimated EIRRs are higher than the assumed minimum
rate (12 percent). Further, measures have been taken to reduce these risks. Table 10
(AnnexC) summarizes the sensitivity analysis for the risks that were quantified.

6.17    Increased  Salinity in Shuangta Reservoir.  There is a potential increase in
salinity in the Shuangta Reservoir water due to planned upstream reclamation of salinized
soils drained by the stretch of the Shule River from Qiduntang to Bulunji of Changma
Irrigation  District.   The water quality, as defined  by  mineral content, deteriorates
somewhat after leaving the Shuangta Reservoir. A forecast of water quality, based on a
linear mixing basic model with a water balance regulation calculation, shows that the
mineralization level of Shuangta Reservoir can meet acceptable standards for farm
irrigation water (less than 2 grams/liter) only if the period of land reclamation is more
than 10 years (8-, 10- and 12-year periods were considered). If the period of land
reclamation is less than 10 years, the water quality will have some impact on crop yield,
mainly affecting wheat, barley, beans, and vegetables during July-August irrigation.
Local experimental data shows that crop yields will be reduced by about 5 percent on



- 57 -
average. The risk from high mineralization (over 2 grams minerals/liter) has been
estimated to reduce crop yields by 5 percent (for crops mentioned above) in Shuangta
Area for a 10-year reclamation period in Changma Irrigation Area. The analysis shows
that the EIRR for the Shuangta component would fall from 23.4 in the base model to 18.1
should this actually occur. However, the PMO has proposed the following measures to
ensure Shuangta Reservoir will conform to the irrigation water quality standard:
(a)   adopt a phased 10-year plan (1996-2005) for land reclamation and salt
leaching;
(b)   timing of land reclamation and salt leaching with high stage flow of Shule
River;
(c)   closely monitor the mineral content of leaching water flowing into and out
of the reservoir, and adjust land reclamation accordingly.
6.18  Natural Disasters. According to the water balance calculation over the 41 years
of available hydrologic data (1952-93), and local meteorological statistics from the
agricultural department of Yumen and Anxi, there is a drought (P=75%) every four to
five years, and localized scorching heat waves or damaging sand storms about once in
five to six years. During the drought years, the area (about 60,000 ha) may face water
deficit (annual average about 73.6 million mi3) between April and June. This would
reduce mainly yields of wheat and barley by 5 to 10 percent through reduced irrigation
water supplied. Impact on other crops will be minimum. The scorching heat waves
would also mainly reduce crop yield of wheat and barley by about 5 to 10 percent in
average, although the effect on barley is somewhat less. Reduced yields of 8 and 7
percent for wheat and barley once every four years for drought, and every five years for
heat waves have been adopted in the risk analyses over the 30-year life span for the
project. This reduces the EIRR of the irrigation and drainage component from 18.2
percent of the base model to 17.2 percent, and net present value from Y 619.7 million to
Y 525 million. The measures adopted to minimize the risks would include:
(a)   establishing primary protecting forestry belts at the fringes of irrigation
districts and on-farm shelter belts and windbreaks;
(b)   promoting and extending water-saving irrigation technology;
(c)   conjunctive use of available groundwater with surface water, and
(d)   using computerized optimization modeling techniques provided for the
irrigation system for drought crisis management.
6.19  Stable Yields Delayed. There is also a risk that crop yields assumed in the base
model would not be stabilized within eight years of land reclamation and cultivation.
Delay might arise due to lack of experience of new migrant farmers with irrigated
agriculture, slow improvement of land reclaimed and soil amelioration, compounded by



- 58 -
the harsh natural elements. The EIRR is recalculated for this risk by assuming a
conservative crop yield, which increases gradually in the first 3 years, and reaches the
stable path after 11 years based on the yield decrease of 5 to 20 percent for different crops
in the stable year. This reduces the EIRR of the irrigation and drainage component from
18.2 percent to 16.3 percent.
6.20  Reduced Benefits from Lower Canal System Efficiency. With the irrigation
improvement and new construction the overall canal system efficiency would increase
from 50 percent to 62 percent, which is the designed efficiency used in determining the
irrigation supply and demand under the project. Given the importance of land settlement
in this project, the efficiency is a key factor in determining the amount of new land that
can be developed for irrigation and, therefore, the number of settlers. Since canal system
efficiency is influenced by the size of the irrigation scheme, topography and soil
conditions, extent of canal lining, quality of construction, and standard of operation and
maintenance, the risk of not achieving the designed 62 percent efficiency exist. Risk and
sensitivity analyses have been conducted for a range of lower efficiency values (55
percent and 60 percent) evaluated against the projected benefits and the actual efficiency
achieved and monitored. The EIRR was recalculated by assuming a set of lower
irrigation efficiency value (55 percent and 60 percent), which would reduce irrigation
water supply by 121.8 and 31.9 Mm3, respectively. An optimal cropping pattern (based
on 55 percent efficiency), which jointly optimized irrigation and settlement benefits (to
minimize the benefits lost in agricultural production while ensuring self-sufficiency for
the 200,000 settlers), would retain the irrigation area for all single-cropped areas (grain,
fruit and cash crops), and reduce the irrigation area for pasture (from 11,060 ha to
4,000 ha) and some multiple cropping areas. This would reduce the EIRR of the
livestock component from 29 percent of the base model to 13.6 percent, and net present
value from about Y 58 million to Y 5 million. For the whole project, the results are less
sensitive to the reduced canal system efficiency. At 55 percent canal efficiency, the
EIRR would fall from 18.8 percent to 18.3 percent, and the net present value from Y 774
million to Y 721 million. Impact of 60 percent canal efficiency would be even less.
However, the risk of reduced efficiency would be minimized through the extensive
construction of canal linings throughout the canal network, improved system operation
and maintenance, and establishment of a computerized system for monitoring, simulating
and dispatching of irrigation water. In addition, the canal efficiency would also be
progressively monitored and evaluated with completion of the irrigation facilities. The
results would be reviewed during the interim project implementation review to be carried
out in 2000 and 2003, and changes would be made to project design, if deemed necessary.
6.21  Resources and Institutional Capacity. The other substantial risks that could
delay implementation of land settlement are:
(a)   lack of timely and adequate counterpart funds to finance project activities;
(b)   inadequate institutional capacity for project implementation; or
(c)   settlers give up and return to their original place.



- 59 -
Financial requirements for voluntary emigration and land settlement of 200,000 persons
would be very large and concentrated in a few later years due to rapid implementation.
Any shortages of counterpart funds would substantially slow implementation and delay
benefits. The associated risks arising from delay in project implementation have been
reflected in the economic analysis. A two-year delay in the implementation will reduce
irrigation and drainage benefits by 5.2 percent, forestry development benefits by 4.4
percent, and livestock components by 16 percent, with an overall benefit reduction of 5.8
percent. To ensure provision of timely and adequate counterpart funds, Gansu Province
has confirmed that counterpart funds have been committed and agreed to submit annual
budgets and work programs to the Bank/IDA for review (see paras. 3.39 and 4.5). To
further assist Gansu Province in facilitating implementation of the land settlement
component, part of the local expenditures incurred under land settlement would be
disbursed against the loan/credit.
6.22  As for institutional capacity for project implementation, Gansu has many years of
successful experience in carrying out voluntary settlement in Hexi Corridor under the
"Two Xi" poverty reduction programs. Currently, voluntary settlement of 80,000 people
is in progress under the Yindaruqin Irrigation Scheme being completed under the Gansu
Provincial Development Project. Experienced staff from the Two Xi Commission and
Yindaruqin will train and guide other new project staff. The risk with implementing
capacity would be further reduced through systematic planning of settlement programs to
be carried out in stages and well integrated with the progress of land reclamation and
infrastructure construction. An effective institution would also be established to oversee,
manage and monitor the settlement programs. The possibility of large numbers of settlers
returning to their origins would be minimized by selecting settlers with positive attitudes,
motivated for emigration to improve their economic well-being, and trained to adapt to
the new environments. Overall institutional support and strengthening would be included
in the project to ensure that the operation, maintenance and management of completed
works and production activities would be sustained. Satisfactory agricultural production
models and systems are already in place in the existing irrigated areas. The agricultural
yields and production projections are based on existing models and systems, and are
therefore realistic and sustainable, and would provide both safety and adequate incomes
for new settlers.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1   At negotiations, the following assurances were obtained from Gansu Province to:
(a)   (i) complete remedial works to the existing Shuangta and Chejinxia
Reservoirs not later than December 31, 1998; and (ii) carry out periodic
safety inspections of the completed Changma Reservoir, and the existing

Sumarv of Environmental Action Plan
General
A comprehensive environmental impact assessment study was jointly
carried out by China Northwest Design and Research Institute of Ministry of
Electric Power and Gansu Design Provincial Hydropower Investigation and Design
Institute of Ministry of Water Resources. The study report has identified both
adverse and positive impacts as a result of project activities and development,
and recommended appropriate measures to mitigate the adverse effects. Beside the
normal impacts resulting from construction activities, the most significant
adverse impacts are:
(a) potential increase of salinity level in the existing Shuangta Reservoir
as a result of land reclamation and salt leaching to be carried out under
the project in the Changma Irrigation Area located upstream of the
reservoir;
(b) changes to the regime of groundwater along the middle reaches of Shule
River as result of flow regulation by the Changma Dam and diversion of
water to new irrigated land developed;
(c) demand for energy by new migrants may lead to cutting of trees and
shrubs for fuelwood; and
(d) the Changma Reservoir will inundate about 131 households (566 persons)
and would require resettlement elsewhere.   (This impact has been dealt
with separately through the preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan).
Plan for Mitigation and Management
In close consultation with the design institutes who carried out the
impact study and the Bank missions, Gansu Government has drawn up a plan for
mitigation and management of the environmental impacts. The plan (see Annex D
Table 1) covers short-term and long-term impact as follows:
Short-Term: The short-term plan cover mainly mitigation of adverse effects
arising from project construction activities, sanitation, waste disposal, air and
noise pollution abatement. Disease control and treatment among the new voluntary
migrants and relocatees resettled from the Changma Reservoir area is also
included. Industrial and urban effluent polluting the Shiyou River, currently
under the implementation, will be continued with funding from the Yumen City
Government and polluting enterprises concerned.
Long-Term: The long-term plan covers monitoring of impacts on land and
water resources, including biota of plant and animals. Surface and ground water
quality, groundwater level, and salinity level in the Shuangta Reservoir will be
monitored at regular intervals up to year 2005 and beyond where necessary. Micro
climate changes and induced earthquake by the Changma Dam will also be monitored.
Implementation Schedule
The plan will be carried out through the project implementation
period from 1996 - 2005.  Some long-term plan items will be continued after
completion of the project construction in 2005. The implementation schedule is
shown in Annex D Table 2.

Estimated Costs
The total cost is estimated at Y46.2 million as summarized in Annex
D Table 3.  The main items and their estimated costs are as follows:
(a) Data collection & monitoring                         Y12.5 million
(b) Equipment & instruments                               19.3
(c) Installation and commissioning                         2.4
(d) Staff training                                         2.0
(e) Design, supervision and management                    10.0
Total                                       Y46.2 million
Management
The physical activities - data collection, monitoring and analytical
work will be contracted out to local environmental agencies and universities who
have the necessary capacity and competence to carry out such activities. This
would avoid the Project Office of setting up of its own establishment, leading
to duplicating staff and equipment. The Monitoring and Evaluation Division under
the Project Management Bureau will be responsible to oversee the contracted
environmental agencies, with assistance from technical specialists, if necessary.
Monitoring
A comprehensive environmental monitoring system will be established
to monitor the long-term impacts on land and water resources in the Shule River
Basin.   Technical assistance has been sought  from the International  Land
Improvement and Reclamation (ILIR) of Netherlands to plan and design the system.
Key monitoring stations will be set up prior to start of the main project work
in order to collect baseline data for comparison. The proposed system network
is generally shown in the attached sketch map to the Annex D. Key parameters to
be monitored would include: water quality parameters for both surface and
groundwater, meteorological data, water table, terrestrial and aquatic biota, and
soil salinity.
Rehabilitation of Source Areas after Emigration
Environmental rehabilitation of the source areas in the eleven
emigating counties would be planned and carried out by the local governments
after permanent emigration of the people.   Priority would be given to the
environmentally degraded areas on hilly land and cultivated land on steep slopes.
The rehabilitation would be mostly through soil and water conservation measures
which are well-tested locally and cost efficient. The measures would include
afforestation, planting of shrubs and grass, closing of hilly land and steep
slopes for cultivation, terracing and benching, and change of cropping patterns
with less emphasis on food grain cultivation. The itemized works items and cost
estimates are given in Table 4. A total of 25,000 ha would be rehabilitated in
the eleven counties at a total cost of Y13.5 million (base cost).

Summary of Involuntary Resettlement Action Plan'
for Chanqma Reservoir
General
1.           The planning of a dam (Changma Dam) on the Shule River to store water
for irrigation and hydropower generation dated back to the early 1960s.
Inhabitants along the Shule River valley were aware of the proposed Changma Dam
and the local government has since restricted much of the economic development
in the valley to be affected by the reservoir. The proposed Changma Dam, 55 m
high with a crest length of 350 m, would create a reservoir covering about 12 km2
of water surface area with a total storage capacity of about 194 million m3.
The reservoir would provide irrigation water to improve and develop a total of
about 98,000 ha of cropland on the Shule River alluvial plain.  Some 200,000 poor
farmers would be emigrated from upland resource poor regions in central and
southeast Gansu and settled on the 54,000 ha newly developed irrigated land. A
total of 131 families  (566 persons)  will have to be moved from the Changma
Reservoir area and resettled on a 5580-mu new resettlement site in the Huahai
Irrigation Area
Assessment of Land, People and Assets Affected
2.           Based on the latest detailed engineering survey and investigation and
(based on 1 in 5,000 topographic map), computation of backwater curve, a total
of 172 ha existing cropland and 131 families involving 566 persons in the
following three Shuixia village groups will be affected by inundation of the
proposed reservoir.

Policies, Laws and Regulations
The main policy objectives adopted by Gansu for the involuntary
resettlement are: (i) productive level and standard of living of relocatees
should not be lower than before relocation; and (ii) the rate of economic
development and improving standard of living should be comparable to that of the
local residents in the resettlement area. These policy objectives are in line
with that of the Bank's OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.
The principal laws and regulations governing the process of land
acquisition and resettlement under the project are:
(a) The Land Management Law of PRC
(b) Implementation Regulations of the Land Management Law of PRC, State
Council Document No. 73 promulgated on January 4, 1991 and effective in
February 1992.
(c) State Council Document No. 74 on Regulations on the Land Acquisition
Compensation and Resettlement for Large and Medium-sized Water Conservancy
and Hydro-electric Power Projects effective from May 1, 1991.
Consultation Processes and Participation
The inhabitants of the Changma Valley were aware of the proposed
Changma Reservoir as early as 1960s when planning of the Changma Dam was carried
out. The local government has planned and controlled development in the valley
so as to minimize acquisition of cultivated land and relocation of people when
the project is launched.
Close consultation was maintained between the Project Authority,
Gansu Design Institute, Yumen City Government, Agricultural Commission, local
governments of Changma Village and Huahai Township, and representatives of
affected village groups. Over the period three alternative sites (Bijiantan,
Nanqu Jiudui Dong and Xiahuizhuang) were considered jointly by the stakeholders
and beneficiaries for the resettlement. Xiahuizhuang was finally chosen for its
better land and water resources, and closer access (5 km) to existing community
and services in Huahai Township.
Resettlement Strategies and Alternatives
The main strategy is to ensure that living standard of the affected
people is not lower than prior to resettlement and that there will be
opportunities for further enhancement of their economic well-being comparable to
that of the host population.   To achieve this, affected households will be
resettled on land-for-land basis (4.56 mu per capita) and given housing lots for
building of their new houses.  To further develop their economic well-being,
affected households will participate in the collective production and management
of 2,000 mu commodity crops (licorice, orchards, livestock, etc), small-scale
enterprises and services. The resettlement village will be operating as a basic



- 140 -
unit sharing profit and losses, thereby minimize risk in the production and
economic development activities.
Compensation Standards and Norms
Based on the "Design Specifications of Inundation Treatment of water
Conservancy and Hydro-power Projects (SD130-84)" full replacement costs have been
considered for compensation of land acquisition, relocation, infrastructure,
services, housing and moving expenses. In addition, a multiplier of 4 has been
applied in determining the compensation for land acquisition based on the average
annual output values of the last three years, and a multiplier of 3 for
resettlement compensation in accordance with the provisions of "Regulation of
Compensation for Land Acquisition and Resettlement in the Construction of Large
and medium-sized Water resources and Hydro-power Projects". The average value
of three years output value (1992-94) is Y462.86 per mu as shown in Annex E Table
1. This average value has been used in determining the compensation for land
acquisition (x4) and resettlement (x3) per mu.
Evaluation for Compensation
The amount of compensation evaluated for land acquisition,
resettlement, replacement for infrastructure and services are itemized in Annex
E Table 2. The total amount is Y17.5 million, including expenses for training
of relocatees, management and contingencies.
Compensation and Use of Funds
The total amount of Y17.5 million compensation assessed will be used
for the following purposes:
(a) Development of resettlement site       Y8,370,000  (Table 3)
(b) Payment to local government for
reconstruction of infrastructure
and services affected in the
Changma Reservoir area                 Y  467,800
(c) Cleaning of reservoir area             Y   15,000
(d) Direct compensation payment
to affected households resettled       Y5,750,000
(e) Transportation in relocation, and
compensation for loss of earning       Y  191,200
(f) Management, training, monitoring
and physical contingency               Y2,720,000
Total                          Y17,513.000
Policy Incentives
Subject to government approval, the policy incentives proposed for
the relocatees are as follows:
(a) supply of building materials at State-controlled prices;
(b) 50% subsidy for production fertilizer for the first four years;
(c) exemption from or reduced payment of taxes on land, housing lot,
special agricultural and forestry products for an initial period of years;
(d) subsidized tariff for electricity supply;
(e) exemption or reduced irrigation water charges for the initial period
of years; and
(f) preference for employment in enterprises and enrollment in school for
children.
Implementation Schedule
Initial development of the resettlement site will begin in 1996 and



- 141 -
the actual physical relocation and resettlement of the affected households will
be carried out in two phases, 1998 and 1999, to be completed before flooding of
the Changma Reservoir in December 2000. The implementation schedule is shown in
Annex E Table 4.
Management and Supervision
The Yumen City Government through its Resettlement Office will be
primarily responsible for the implementation and management of the resettlement
program under the direction of the Project Management Bureau (PMB) . One station
each will be established in Changma Village and the Huahai Township to carry out
the relocation and resettlement, and ultimate rehabilitation in the resettlement
area. The organization structure is shown in Annex E Chart 1. Funds will be
allocated by PMB to the Yumen City Government based on the planned programs
approved. The planned annual expenditures are shown in Annex E Table 5. The
funds will be administered by the Yumen City Government according to normal
government financial procedures and regulations.
Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation of the people resettled will be carried out
by National Research Center for Resettlement (Hehai University) in collaboration
with Gansu Design Institute for a period of five years or until they are
satisfactorily rehabilitated.  The scope and content of M&E are given in the
Appendix to the main RAP. Periodic M&E reports will be submitted to the Project
Management Bureau and the Bank/IDA for review and follow-up actions.

Poverty Background
1.          Gansu Province has about 4.2 million people living below the
threshold of poverty in 41 officially identified poor counties, mostly located
in central and south Gansu. These counties are located in resource poor areas
with an increasing population to support in a much degraded environment. In
some of the remote townships, the poor people are unable to feed themselves
and have to rely on government for relief annually. The economic situations
of the 41 poor counties are summarized in Table 1. Since 1983, with the
establishment of Two Xi Commission in Gansu, poverty reduction programs have
been undertaken to help these poor people. The programs included out-
migration and settlement in better resource areas in Hexi Corridor and other
regions of the province. To-date, a total of 337,000 people have settled in
Hexi Corridor and other irrigated areas in the Yellow River valley. Although
the Two Xi poverty reduction programs have been successful, but the scale was
quite modest due to limited resources. Therefore, Gansu has proposed a major
10-year program to settle 200,000 poor people from central and south Gansu to
Hexi Corridor and at the same to develop large tract of cultivable land for
production of grain and commodity crops to ease current deficits faced by the
province.
Selection Criteria
2.          The selection criteria used are as follows:
(a) County/Township Counties and townships planned for emigration are
based essentially on their poor economic situations (per capita income of less
than Y300 and grain production of less than 150 kg), have not benefitted or
substantially benefitted from the Two Xi poverty reduction programs, degraded
environments with most of the cultivation on steep land, and high density of
population. To achieve maximum impact, preference has also been given to
those counties and townships that would form a contiguous group.
(b) Emigrants Emigration will be strictly voluntary by application from
rural people residing within the planned townships. Selection of prospective
emigrants will be based on a two-stage selection criteria established below:
First Stage:
(i) per capita income of less than Y300 and grain production <150 kg;
(ii) at least two workers in the household with the head of the
household between the age of 18 and 50 years;
(iii) at least two years of primary education or acceptable literacy
level (relaxed for minority applicants);
(iv) experience in agricultural production; and
(v) in good health, mentally sound, and not physically handicapped.
Second Stage:
(i) per capita income less than Y150 and grain production <50 kg;
(ii) demonstrate intensive desire to emigrate;
(iii) 75% of the existing cultivated land is on slope above 25 degree;
(iv) possess junior middle school education, technical skill and
vocational training; and
1\ For details see "Report on Implementation of In-Migration Settlement" in
project files.



- 156 -
(v) demonstrate pioneering spirit and leadership.
3.          The second stage criteria will only be used in the event the
number of applicants far exceeded the number of places available. Some 101 of
the emigrants with higher incomes and possessing high motivation and technical
skills will also be specially selected for early settlement to serve as lead
or demonstration farmers to other migrants. Preference will be given to
minority applicants to fill the planned number of minority emigrants for each
township. The literacy level requirements for minority applicants will also
be somewhat relaxed in view of their lower literacy level.
Counties/Townships Selected for Emigration
4,          The selected eleven counties covering 95 townships with the
numbers of planned emigrants and minority emigrants for each township are
shown in Table 2. The number of emigrants indicated for each township is
strictly for planning purposes only. The actual numbers of emigrants and the
village groups will only be determined after emigration applications have been
received and processed. However, flexibility will be maintained in the final
determination of number of emigrants between village groups under each
township, and also between townships in the event the planned number of
emigrants cannot be filled. The total number of emigrants planned is 200,000
persons with 50,000 (25%) from minority groups.
Consultation and Participation Processes
5.          There is over-whelming enthusiasm to emigrate to Hexi Corridor in
view of the better economic prospects. The planned 200,000 people represent
the optimum number of new migrants that Hexi Corridor will be able to
accommodate with the resources to be developed under the project. The
stakeholders in the source areas (county and township governments) as well as
the host governments (Anxi County and Yumen City) have been closely consulted
in the planning and design of the emigration and settlement plan. The
stakeholders will also be represented in the advisory and consultative
committees and groups to work closely with the project implementation
authorities. At the grassroots level, village emigration/settlement groups
will be formed to inform and receive applications from intending emigrants.
Representatives of emigrants, including local community and religious leaders,
will be included in these village groups.
6.          A systematically planned participatory process will be used to
inform and involve the people in the source areas. The village
emigration/settlement groups will use mass media to inform the people of the
planned emigration and settlement programs. This will include radio
broadcast, public meeting, notification, handouts, visits to settlement areas
by emigrant representatives, and talks by successful immigrants in their own
original villages.
7.          Each emigration applicant will receive an information package,
informing him of the emigration and settlement programs, prospects, risks,
government assistance in emigration and settlement, land allocation and lease,
infrastructure and services provided in the settlement areas, incentives and
policy preferences for immigrants, returns expected by government, emigrant's
responsibility, default and penalty. Details of application, processing and
selection procedures will also be included in the information package.
New Settlement Planned in Project Area
8.          Sixteen new townships/sub-farms have been planned in three
irrigation areas (Changma, Shuangta and Huahai) in Shule River Basin under the
project. Details are given in Table 3. Under these 16 townships/sub-farms
160 administrative villages will be established, each with 5 to 10 residential
village groups containing 250 - 300 families each. Each township/sub-farm
will have a population of 12,500 - 13,500 people.  During the initial stage of



- 157 -
settlement, basic education (primary and secondary schools) and health
facilities will be provided by the project to each township and village.
Later, as the settlement areas stabilize and grow, the local governments will
provide other necessary amenities and services.
Minority Emigrants
9.          The main minority groups in Central and Southeast Gansu are the
Dongxiang, Islamic Hui and Tibetans. No separate settlement plan has been
proposed for the minority emigrants, but they will enjoy the same economic
benefits as the Hans. However, provisions of the Bank OD 4.20 on Indigenous
Peoples have been considered in the settlement programs to ensure that the
minority groups will have their socio-cultural traditions retained as far as
possible. For this purpose, major minority groups will be settled in one
community according to their wishes. One township will be exclusively
established for the Dongxiang minority emigrants and 10 villages for the
Islamic Hui emigrants. Minority community and religious leaders will serve on
the local township and village settlement groups to help to resolve any issues
relating to minority groups. Minority migrants will also enjoy the same
incentives as the Han migrants in addition to the current government policy
preference given to minority people in employment, enrollment in schools for
minority children, and exemption for payment of school fees and text books.
The demographic and socio-economic comparisons between the main minority
groups and the Chinese Hans, represented by typical emigrating counties, are
summarized in Table 4.
Settlement Subsidies
10.         For each emigrant, the government will provide the following
subsidies over the period of two years:
Direct subsidy to emiqrants
(a) Relocating expenses                                Y350
(b) Construction of house                                400
(c) Purchase of production inputs                         90
(d) Purchase of agricultural tools, etc                   60
(e) Purchase of coal for heating, cooking                100
(f) Water supply                                          60
(g) Electricity                                           40
Sub-total                                 Y1.100
Indirect subsidy for amenities and services
(h) Primary and secondary schools                      Y272
(i) Health facilities                                     42
(j) Tubewells                                             19
Sub-total                                  Y333
Total                                     Y1.433 oer capita
11.         In addition, the cost for management and monitoring of the
emigrants is estimated at Y31.5 per capita, excluding the cost of new migrants
training estimated at YB.5 million for 7,200 migrants in about 300,000 person-
sessions. The overall total settlement base cost is estimated at Y292.9
million for 200,000 people or Y1,465 per capita. In addition to the above
financial subsidies, all migrants will be exempted from payment of taxes
(land, agricultural and forestry products) and rent for the first three years
of their settlement.



- 158 -
Land Distribution & Lease to Settlers
12.         In the settlement areas, each migrant will be allocated basic 2.0
mu irrigated land on land use contracts for 30 years without payment (about 10
mu or 0.67 ha per household of five) for crop cultivation, beside 534 m2 for
housing and 667 m2 for fruit tree and vegetable gardens. In addition, each
migrant will also be eligible to lease additional 1.5 to 2.0 mu (0.1 - 0.133
ha) of land with phased rent payments; zero for 1st - 3rd year, Y75 per mu for
4th - 6th year, and Y150 for 7th - 10th year. After the 10th year, the lease
is subject to negotiations and renewal. Larger family farms at 10 ha per
household will also be promoted, but the number will be limited to 150
households.
Training of New Migrants in Settlement Areas
13.         New migrant farmers from central and southeast Gansu settling in
Hexi Corridor will have no experience in irrigated agriculture, multi-cropping
systems integrated with livestock and forestry in a totally new environment.
They will need training in irrigation techniques, multi-cropping, livestock
and forestry production systems. An integrated training plan has been
prepared by a special working group appointed by the Project Management Bureau
(PMB). The detailed training program is given in Table 5. It will cover
7,200 township and village technical staff and lead farmers, and about 300,000
person-sessions for general farmers on various topics. The total estimated
cost is Y8.44 million over the a 10-year period. The working group has been
retained to supervise and monitor the implementation and performance of the
training plan.
Women Migrants in Development
14.         Women migrants would be encouraged to participate in the project
development activities. Special interventions have been designed to cater to
their specific needs. These are summarized in Table 6. The programs include
specific targets for employment in the public sector and service sectors,
construction, rural enterprises, and financial assistance in the development
of small family-run business and cottage industries. Women migrants would be
given preference in obtaining credit under the project' revolving fund of Y15
million. It is projected that by the end of the project implementation period
some 4,000 women migrants or about one third of the total women migrants would
have received vocational training.   The performance and impact of women
participation in project development would be monitored based on the program
indicators in Table 6.
Estimated Costs for Settlement
15.         The total base cost for settlement is estimated at Y292.9 million
(Y489.9 million including physical and price contingencies). The itemized
costs and the planned investment over a 10-year period are summarized in Table
7.
Settlement Management
16.         The annual emigration and settlement programs, approved by the
Project Management Bureau, will be implemented and managed by the existing
County Settlement Offices (CSOs) in each of the eleven emigrating counties in
central and southeast Gansu and the two host county/city responsible for the
new settlement areas in Hexi Corridor. The respective County
Emigration/Settlement Committee will sign annual contracts with the PMB and
supervise the CSO for the implementation. Funds for the emigration and
settlement based on approved programs will be allocated annually to the
county/city governments by the PMB. The overall organization structure for
the implementation and management is shown in Chart 3 of the SAR.



- 159 -
Monitoring & Evaluation
17.         A comprehensive monitoring system will be established under the
project to be operated by the Demographic Research Institute of the Lanzhou
University in Gansu Province. The system will be used to screen and select
emigrant applicants based on weighted criteria and to create a data base of
the emigrants selected. A 10% sample size of the migrant households will be
tracked annually to monitor their socio-economic progress and compare their
performance against the planned targets. The annual monitoring and evaluation
results will be used by the project management authorities in the planning of
programs for the subsequent years and also for the Mid-Term Review exercise to
be conducted for the project in 1999. More details of performance targets and
impact monitoring are given in Annex H.

The Gansu Hexi Corridor Project is a multi-purpose water resources development project
to accommodate an increase in population of 200,000 being relocated from extreme poor
areas of Gansu Province. The Project requires the construction of the Changma
Reservoir on the Shule River, approximately 540 km of diversion canals and 970 km of
irrigation canals and 450 km of drainage ditches. The design flows within the main
diversion canals are between 30 to 42 m3/s, and between I - 9 m3/s for the secondary
canals. The joint operation of the Changma Reservoir with the exiting Shuangta
Reservoir, located downstream on the Shule River, and the Chijinxia Reservoir on the
Shiyou River, would be able to regulate as much as 90.40 of the surface runoffs. The
cultivated areas within the Changma, Shuangta and Huahai irrigation command areas
could be increased by 54,600 ha, from the current value of 43,600 ha to 98,200 ha. Other
usage within the project area include industrial and domestic consumptions. Ground
water augmentation will be required for all three irrigation command areas with the use
of about 900 wells.
Four hydroelectric power stations are planned to be installed at the Changma Reservoir,
14.25 MW, the Changma Dam intake of the new trunk canal, 12 MW, the west main
canal, 6 MW, and the Shuangta Reservoir, 2.4 MW. In order to ensure the efficient use
of the water resources and the effective distribution of available water, and a sustainable
extraction of ground water, an integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch system
will be required.
2.0   SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
The integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch system will be able to monitor the
state of operation of the entire project, including the operation of all three reservoirs, the
flow conditions of all hydroelectric stations, discharges at key locations along the
diversion and irrigation canals, discharges at the drainage ditches, quantity of ground
water extractions and meteorological variables. Automatic monitoring should be
provided for water levels and discharges of all three reservoirs, and flow conditions of
the trunk, main, and sub-main canals. Other variables should be observed manually at



- 175 -
proper intervals or obtained through interfacing with the environmental monitoring
database.
The integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch svstem will have the capability to
simulate the operation of the entire system to evaluate system operation strategy, for
irrigation diversion as the primarv objective and hydroelectric power generation and to
forecast short term system behaviour. It is noted that the daily load variations may be
incorporated into short term diversion operation.
The monitoring of the svstem will ensure a smooth and efficient operation for water
distribution within the svstem. To provide effective control of the distribution and to
eliminate potential human operational errors, flows control gates to the trunk canals, the
main canals, and to the sub-main canals could be controlled automatically. Therefore,
as many as 26 gates can be included, among which 17 are located in Changma, 5 at
Shuangta, and 4 at Huahal imgation areas. While the releases at the hydropower stations
are regulated by system diversion operations, flood control procedures of individual
reservoir, whenever necessary, will take precedence.
The monitoring system will also provide a database on the system operation, so that the
dynamics of the entire system can be examined, and system operation strategy can be
refined towards a more optimal conjunctive use of the available water resources within
the Shule-Shiyou River Basin. Manual input of data will be necessary for manually
observed variables. Interface with the environmental monitoring database will probably
be required. The use of GIS can be considered if its use is shown necessary to enhance
the usability and to simplify the user interface.
In order to provide the planning staff with a complete view of the agnrcultural
productions from the operation. periodic data on cultivated areas from all three irrigation
command areas can be considered as part of the database, if these information has not
been included in other component of the project. The production data can be surveyed
and entered to the database manually.
3.0   SYSTEM STRUCTURE AND COMPONENTS
a.    Monitoring and Management Information System
The operation of the entire Hexi Corridor Project will be monitored from a
control centre located at the Project Management Office in Yumen Township.



- 176 -
Both spatial and temporal state variables of major components of the Project and
meteorological data, such as precipitation, air temperature, evaporation and wind
speed. will be monitored, stored and archived with the use of a database.
Sampling frequency or observation intervals will depend on the dynamics of the
variables. Sampling of the state variables, which are monitored automatically,
mav be performed at source or at the control centre. A list of variables to be
included in the svstem database will be required together with their
corresponding characteristics, which will include, but not limited to, the
following: name, location, data format, and sampling frequency or interval.
Basic data processing, such as error checking, checking of data range, basic
statistics, and basic data presentations, should be provided.
b.    Transmission and Communication
Remote sensing sites can be linked to several sub-stations, located at the
Management Offices of the three irrigation command areas. These sub-stations
will then be linked to the control centre at the Hexi Corridor Project Management
Centre. via a proven and reliable mode of data transmission. A microwave
communication system is planned for the project to link all operational units.
This system can be considered and adopted for data transmission. Other
alternatives, such as linking the monitoring stations directly to the Project
Management Centre, can be considered if shown to be more efficient.
Transmission frequency and the amount of data transmitted will depend on the
design of the monitoring system.
c.    Computer Modelling
A computer model will be requtired to simulate the operation of the entire system
covering all major system components for flow regulations, diversions, ground
water extractions, drainage, and hydroelectric generations. This model should
be capable of evaluating different operation strategies for decision making, and
should considered the temporal and spatial variations of discharges within the
system. Development of the computer model should be based on proven
computer codes and interface to the system database should be provided.
As the combined length of the main diversion canal and the west main canal is
over 80 km, it may be necessary to have the computer model, or perhaps a



- 177 -
dynamic flow routing model, to verify the short term diversion schedule. The
computer model(s) should be versatile enough for future updating.
d.    System Interface
User interface should be provided for ease of use of the various components of
the computer system. The development of the user interface can be considered
as a separate component, or be partially integrated with the system database and
the modelling software.
4.0   EQUIPMENT AND METHODOLOGY
4.1    Office Space
The control centre can be housed in the building of the Administration Bureau of the
Shule River Basin located in Yumen Township. Approximately 300 m2 of office space
will be required.
4.2   Hardware
Equipment for the control and monitoring of the hydroelectric power stations will be
included with the installation of the power stations. Only hardware required for
monitoring the canals, simulation and automatic gate controls are included here. The
monitoring, simulation, and dispatch system will probably be a micro-computer based
system. It is anticipated that the following hardware will be required:
a micro-computer system, which will be used as the server,
a micro-computer system, which will be used at the control centre;
micro-computers for sub-stations;
pnnters;
a tablet;
communication system hardware,
UPS's,
water level sensors with interface:
flow meters with interface.



- 178 -
4.3   Software
General commercial software should be used if possible. for the operating system,
database, networking, and supporting utilities. Efficient exchange of data with other
project components should be considered in their selection.
Simulation model of the svstem should be developed from proven computer codes, and
should be easilv portable among operating platforms. Proprietary models or models for
which source codes are not disclosed should not be selected, unless their usability and
functionalitv are overwhelmingly superior.
5.0   TECHNICAL INPUTS
The integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch system is not expected to be very
complicated. The monitoring system of state variables is straight forward. However, the
development of the simulation computer model for operational decision making require
thorough understanding of the dynamic relationships among various components of the
system and numerical simulation techniques. Therefore, two expert advisors, either
intemational or domestic, on telemetry in water resources, and water resources system
simulation are recommended. Perhaps, a hardware specialist on computing and
communication hardware should be consulted.
6.0   IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
As the diversion canals are not expected to be completed until the 7th year of the project,
the hardware system selection and acquisition should be conducted the earliest in the 4 dh
year of the project, in order to take advantage in the latest technological developments
and to provide a relatively continuous therefore more efficient, execution of this project
component. The following implementation schedule is provided based on a seven-year
project implementation period. If the implementation period is scheduled to be longer,
all activities from vear 4 on should be postponed accordingly. The development of the
simulation model for the svstem should be carried out at the beginning of the project.
a.    Planning and Design
Planning and design of the simulation model for the system should begin
immediatelv with no conflict with other components of the project. The



- 179 -
simulation modelling software should be developed first and preliminary runs
should be conducted with the current available data to verify the system
configuration. Then the monitoring network should be established, which would
be followed by the design of the database and the monitoring and control system
during year 5 of the project.
The computer modelling software of the system can be developed together with
the simulations of the system with the currently available data, within the first
year of the project implementation. The planning of the monitoring network and
the database can then follow.
b.    Equipment Acquisition
A svstem of micro-computer, such as a PC-Pentium- 100, together with adequate
accessories, should be acquired for the computer modelling software
development and model simulations at the beginning of the project
implementation. Other equipment can be acquired at the beginning of year 6.
C.    Installation and Implementation
The first micro-computer system for the development of the simulation software
should be installed at the beginning of the project implementation phase. The
development of the simulation model and the preliminary runs should be
conducted within year 1, with limited activities in the following years.
The design of the monitoring and automatic control system and the database
should begin in year 5. Acquisition of required hardware should commence in
the second half of year 5.
The development of the database should follow as soon as the server computer
is installed (in mid-year 6). The installation of automatic monitoring devices and
computer system as sub-stations should begin as soon as the civil structures are
ready (year 6). The installation of the data communications devices will follow
as soon as the microwave system and the communication hardware are installed
(late vear 6 to eariv year 7). The installation testing of the complete monitoring,
simulation and dispatch system should be concluded by mid-year 7.

7.0   Training of Operation Staff
Training of operation staff is a important part of the monitoring, simulation and dispatch
system, particularly operation and planning personnel responsible for the execution of
the simulation, database maintenance, and computer system operations. Other training
should include gate operators, well operators, canal inspectors and maintenance crew.
User manuals for the execution of the simulation model, database, and svstem operations
should be produced, which can be used as training materials for the operation and
planning personnel. Operation manuals for gate and well operations should be provided
for the field operators.

Canal Linina
Gansu's Experience in Canal Lining
1.          Located in northwest China, Gansu has a dry and cold climate.  The
Project area in Hexi Corridor has annual average rainfall of 47 - 160 mm,
evaporation of 2,000 - 3,050 mm, average monthly low temperature of -8.1 to -
16.7 degree C, with absolute low temperature of -24 to -29.3 degree C. The
ground freezing depth ranges from 0.8 to 1.8 meters. Therefore, canal lining
works for preventing seepage and their damages by frost heave during winter
are of particular importance in Gansu. In this respect Gansu has accumulated
considerable years of successful experience. Types of canal lining, based on
materials to be used, are as follows:
(a) dry stone blocks
(b) block in cement pitching (conglomerates or cut stone blocks)
(c) concrete (precast and in-situ)
(d) plastic membrane
The type of canal lining used depends on the availability of local materials,
swelling characteristics of the base soil materials, water table level, and
flow velocity in canals. Canal lining cross-sections are mostly stepped
trapezoidal and also some with parabolic base, vertical sides, and U-shaped.
Cross-sections with parabolic base and U-Shaped are more resistant to frost
heave caused by swelling of soil. But U-shaped sections are generally of
precast concrete units or cast in-situ concrete, mostly used on smaller canals
below branch canal with lower flow velocity.
Dry Block Conglomerate Lining:  Mainly used in areas where local
conglomerate stones are available at site. Roughness factor is about 0.0275
to 0.03. Lining thickness is less than 20 cm and can stand up to velocity of
3 m/sec. Although economic but less effective in seepage prevention,
averaging with 2.6% per km canal seepage losses.
Cut Blocks in Cement Pitching:  The roughness factor is about 0.0275 and
lining can stand flow velocity up to 4 m/sec. Resist frost heave better than
concrete lining.
Concrete Lining: This is the main type of lining used in Gansu. It has
been extensively used in mid- and down-stream areas of Shule River and Hedong
Loess Area where conglomerate stones are scarce. Due to difficulty in
repairing cracks of in-situ concrete lining caused by frost heave, more
precast concrete linings have been used instead. Seepage loss is about 0.4%
per km canal with seepage rate of 0.12 to 0.14 cu.m./m2/day.

Institute.

Polyvinal Plastic Membrane:  There two methods of use.  First, the
membrane is used together with concrete lining.  The concrete panels prevent
scouring and damages to plastic membranes and its ageing through weathering.
This method is used mostly on canals with larger flow velocity. Second, the
membrane is covered with a layer of protective soil or gravel. This method
can only be used in area with high water table and low velocity flow in canal
(generally less than 1 m/sec). Seepage prevention by plastic membrane is
effective with seepage losses at 0.01' per km canal or seepage rate of 0.12 to
0.14 cu.m./m2/day.
Frost Heave Prevention Measures
2.          Based on Gansu's several years of experiment and operation
experience, the main method is to replace the silty or clayey sub-soil
supporting canal linings with a more sandy and gravely soil materials. The
thickness of sub-soil replacement layer depends on natural site conditions.
In areas with lower water table, thin layer of light soil with sandy gravel
soil beneath, the thickness of sub-soil replacement layer, including the
thickness of concrete lining, should be not less than half of the maximum
freezing depth. This would basically eliminate damages caused by frost heave.
In areas with higher water table, canal bed with clayey or heavy loam soils,
the thickness of replacement layer should be 70% to 80% of the maximum
freezing depth to be effective against frost heave.
Proposed Canal Lining for Gansu Hexi Corridor (Shule River) Project
3.          Gansu Hexi Corridor (Shule River) Project will cover 98,200 ha of
irrigated land in Changma, Shuangta and Huahai Irrigation Areas. The canal
system includes trunk, main, sub-main, branch, lateral, sub-lateral and field
canals with varied soil conditions and water table levels. The maximum
freezing depth also varies. Therefore, the types of canal lining described
above will be encountered. The five types of canal lining proposed for the
Hexi Project is further clarified below:
(a) Type I: The canal bed is constructed with either in-situ or precast
concrete with side slopes in precast concrete slabs or panels without sub-soil
sandy gravel replacement layer. This type of canal lining is to be used for
canals running over gravely soil and without the need for frost heave
prevention, and with flow velocity less than 3.5 m/sec. The precast units can
be mass produced and installed with flexibility in work schedule. The Type I
lining will be used mostly on the branch canals of the New West Main Canal and
the connecting canals to the Old West main Canal in Changma Irrigation Area,
most of the Xihu sub-main canals, and the first 4.6 km of the Sub-main Canal
No. 1 of the Changma Trunk Canal.
(b) Type II: The canal bed and slopes will be constructed with in-situ
concrete without the sub-soil replacement layer. This type of lining is to be
used in area with sandy/gravely soils with no frost heave conditions. It can
stand up to flow velocity of 3.5 to 5.0 m/sec. This type of lining is
structurally good with little seepage losses, but less flexible in
construction scheduling than Type I. It will used mainly on improvement of

the Changma Trunk Canal, Changma New West Canal, Sandaoguo Conveyance Canal,
and others.
(c) Type III: The canal bed is laid with block pitching and side slopes
with precast concrete units with 40 cm of sub-soil replacement layer. This
type of lining is used on canals with steeper gradient, higher flow velocity,
higher degree of material movement and scouring due to soil upheaval. The
block pitching is generally 25 to 30 cm and side slope precast units of 8 cm
thickness. The sub-soil replacement layer will depend on the soil upheaval
characteristics, freezing depth, sub-soil conditions, and cross-section of
canals. This type of lining will be used at the end stretch of the Changma
East Main Canal and the upper stretch of Huahai Trunk Canal (Ch. 7+750 and
above).
(d) Tvye IV: The canal bed is laid with in-situ concrete with side
slopes in precast concrete units of 8 cm (6 cm for branch canals), with sub-
soil replacement layer of sandy/gravely soil of 60 to 80 cm thick. This type
of lining is used for canals with flow velocity up to 3.5 m/sec and higher
degree of frost heave is expected. It will be used for Changma North Main
Canal, Anxi North and South Main Canals, and part of Xihu Sub-main Canal
Improvement.
(e) Tvye V: This type uses plastic membrane of 0.18 to 0.2 mm and a
cover protective soil layer. The soil protective layer consists of a top
layer 40 to 50 cm of gravel and a bottom layer of loam soil. This type of
lining is suitable for canals with severe frost heave, flatter gradient and
lower flow velocity. For higher flow velocity, the top protective layer will
need to be protected by a layer of coarser gravely materials to prevent
scouring of the protective layer. This type of lining will be used in the new
stretch of the Anxi North Main Canal, Changma North Sub-main Canal, and middle
stretch of the existing Changma East main Canal, and branch canals with low
flow velocity.
Typical Designs
4.          The five typical designs proposed and their respective estimated
construction cost is summarized in the attached technical characteristics
table.
Construction, Operation and Maintenance
5.          It is important to consider the following:
(a) In-situ concrete-lined canals are difficult to maintain and repair
after damaged. Therefore, its quality of construction for the foundation base
and in-situ concrete should be high to avoid deformation and consequent frost
heave damages.
(b) For precast concrete-lined canals, the high quality of precast
concrete units should be ensured and the mortar jointing should be tight and
firm to prevent cracking and falling of the jointing materials, leading to

seepage.  The seepage water will carry clayey soil materials and contaminate
the sub-soil sandy/gravely replacement layer, thereby inducing frost heave of
the replacement layer and causing damages to the lining.
(c) Expansion/contraction joints should be properly constructed,
otherwise seepage will lead to contamination of the replacement layer and its
subsequent frost heave.
(d) The clayey soil content of the sandy/gravely sub-soil replacement
layer should confirm to design specifications, otherwise the replacement
layers will not achieve its swelling/upheaval prevention functions.
(e) All canals with linings should stop operation before freezing to
prevent damages by icing action.
(f) All canals with linings should be inspected according to timed
schedule and repaired in time to avoid major problems occurring.
