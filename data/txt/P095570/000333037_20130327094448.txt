2.      The IBRD loan in the amount of US$50 million was approved by the Board on
December 19, 2006 and became effective on July 12, 2007. The program, initially of
US$150 million, of which US$50 million are financed by the IADB and US$50 million
are financed by the counterpart, underwent a restructuring in 2010. As a result, it became
a US$160.9 million project, increasing the counterpart’s financing by US$10.9 million.

3.          Overall, the project is rated satisfactory, and is well-positioned to achieve its
objectives. Disbursements currently stand at US$49 million (98% of the Loan amount of
US$50 million). However, an unusually heavy rainy season has prevented completion of
the civil works, particularly for periodic maintenance and the improvement of footpaths.
In the case of improving touristic footpaths, the Borrower neglected to include
Archaeological Monitoring Plans in the terms of references, which delayed that specific
component. Furthermore, the removal of previous backlogs on the institutional
development activities under the decentralized model in the rural road program has also
caused delays in the completion of said undertakings. Under “Monitoring and
Evaluation?, the Borrower also has yet to develop the project’s Baseline Expansion and
Midterm Assessment, which is essential to the project’s completion.

4.          To date, 3,193 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated (95% of the target),
while 2,053 km (87%) of footpaths have been improved. In addition, 6,445 km (86%) of
rural roads have received periodic maintenance, and 72% of the final designs for touristic
footpaths are ready for the 161 km target.

5.           With regard to the development of local capacities, significant progress has
been made with Provincial Road Institutes (IVPs in Spanish). The percentage of IVPs
that have reached level III and IV currently stands at 50, which surpasses the original
target of 45%. Meanwhile, 113 Provincial Road Plans have been formulated and 14
provinces have adopted Provincial Economic Infrastructure Plans, constituting 58% and
93% of their respective targets. The Provincial Economic Infrastructure Plans go beyond
transport planning to include water supply, sanitation, irrigation, mobile communication,
electrification and mines.

6.         Local Development Windows have been established in 24 provinces (80% of
the target of 30). As a result, 43employment-generating projects worth US$8,120,000
have been financed, in addition to 52 business plans for producers’associations.

7.        As of December 2012, 857 microenterprises formed for the purpose of road
maintenance are operating in 143 provinces, covering a total of 16,867 km. They employ
5,749 people, 1,587 (28%) of them women.

8.         Regarding the project’s Gender Action Plan, a substantial number of activities
have been undertaken to bridge gender gaps in employment access and road management
decision-making. The Provincial Road Institutes have undertaken gender training
workshops, in addition to other technical assistance provided to the Institutes and the
Local Development Windows. Future activities include the production of gender
materials and a specialized university course that focuses on the issue of gender in road
management.

9.         Moving forward, the extension of the closing date will allow the Borrower to
reach the project’s targets by completing the following: rehabilitation of three rural roads,
14 footpath improvement works, four touristic footpath improvement works, and 39
periodic maintenance works. This is in addition to institutional development activities the
Borrower plans to carry out. This will be the second extension of the project for a total of
18 months.

10.     Likewise, the proposed reallocation of loan proceeds is mostly justified by
financial reasons, given the updating of investment costs.

11.    In the present proposal, funds will be reallocated among eligible categories.
Mainly, the amount of US$1,023,000 from Category (2) Goods and consultant services
for component 2, US$ 3,278,896 from Category (3) (b) Goods, Works and consultant
services Component 3.b, and US$ 321,192 from Category (4) Goods and consultant
services for Component 4.a will be reallocated to Category (1) Goods, works and
consultant services for component 1 of the Project.

12.        The Borrower has prepared an Action Plan, including enhanced monitoring
and scaling up technical assistance to the local governments and Provias Descentralizado
(the Implementing Agency), so as to ensure the project is fully implemented during the
extension period.
