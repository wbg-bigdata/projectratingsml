REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SYiIIA
FOR A SECCND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommandation on a proposed
Development Credit to Syria for the equivalent of $13.8 million on standard
IDA terms to help finance a Second Highway Project consisting of improve-
ment and construction of 153 km of road, consultant services for the pre-
paration of feasibility studies and detailed engineering of further road
works.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The frequent political and economic changes which have taken place
since Syria became independent in 1946 have made it difficult to pursue a
consistent relationship with the Bank in which Syria would seek assistance
from the Bank Group, maintain a dialogue on economic.matters and prepare
projects meeting the Bank's criteria. As a result, only one lending opera-
tion has been consummated, namely the $8.5 million IDA Credit for the First
Highway Project.made in 1963. Relations have improved since 1969 when the
Government provided the Bank with the necessary inPiormation to prepare an
economic report which wvas distributed to the Executive Directors in March
1970. At that time, the Syrian Government requested IDA financial assis-
tance for a second highway project and submitted other projects for Bank
financing. Shortage of IDA funds at the time delayed until.mid-1971 the
appraisal of the highway project, while the other projects were at too
early a stage of preparation for appraisal. Since thens identification
and preparation of several projects has been pursued even though the need
for adequate technical and economic feasibility studies and the time re-
quired for their preparation.have not always been recognized by the respon-
sible.ministries.
3.        Execution of the First Highway Project has been slow, and $2.0
million were still undisbursed as of January 31, 1972. This was due to a
number of reasons, such as the fact that the Association appraised the
project in 1963 on the basis of inadequate engineering preparation re-
quiring in 1965 a complete re-design of the Damascus-Aleppo-Raqqa road
(for which substantial reconstruction and realignment had to be substi-
tuted for the.mere re-surfacing initially contemplated) as well as a new
economic analysis. In addition, in 1965-67 tensions in the Middle East as
well as the internal political situation had an adverse effect on the re-
sponse of foreign contractors to international competitive bidding for
so-me of the highway sections. Construction, therefcret did not start until



- 2 -
1968. Although slow to start, works are now well under way and will be com-
pleted by late 1973. On the institutional side, progress has been made in re-
organizing the Directorate of Highways, particularly with regard to its high-
way maintenance function, and in training in which the UNDP and ILO have been
active. This will culminate in the reorganization of the Ministry of Communi-
cations along lines discussed with and accepted by the Association. The
establishment of a central maintenance department which was expected for
February 1972 has been delayed somewhat for procedural reasons; it is a con-
dition of effectiveness of the proposed credit. On the whole, most problems
affecting the First Highway Project have now been overcome and execution is
proceeding satisfactorily. A summary statement of IDA lending is attached as
Annex I. There have been no Bank loans or IFC investments in Syria so far.
4.         I hope that the Government's request for Bank Group assistance for
several projects and the consummation of the proposed credit for highways would
begin a period of closer cooperation between Syria and the Bank. In this re-
gard, the Government's major objective is to obtain Bank Group participation
in the financing of the large scale irrigation projects using the waters of
the Euphrates river stored in the USSR-financed multipurpose Tabqa dam, which
is under construction. These irrigation projects, however, raise the problem
of riparian rights with Turkey and Iraq and the Bank is exploring the possi-
bility of an agreement between the three riparians which would enable it to
consider the Euphrates project as well as projects in the other countries.
IIeanwhile, the Bank has been pursuing the identification and preparation of
projects in several other sectors, namely power, transportation, industry,
water supply and education, and discussing with the Government the steps re-
quire:; to put the projects in the shape needed for their appraisal.  The most
advanced of these projects is the power one; should the Government confirm
its willingness to supplement the existing studies with a comprehensive feasi-
bility study including the economic aspects, the projects could be appraised
in FY 1973.
5.         The proposed highway project was prepared with the assistance of
consultants financed under the First Highway Credit and was appraised in May
1971. Negotiations were held in Washington in November/December 1971. The
Syrian Delegation was headed by His Excellency Omar Sibai, Minister of Commu-
nications, and included also Mr. Shahine, Undersecretary of Communications,
Mr. H'meidan, Director of Highways and Bridges, and Mr. Moghrabi, Deputy
Director of Highways and Bridges.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
6.         A report entitled "The Economy of the Syrian Arab Republic" (EMA-45a.
dated February 15, 1972, is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors, and a country data sheet is attached hereto as Annex II. The Re-
port notes the satisfactory economic performance of the country evidenced by
a good growth record (about d.5 percent per annum between 1961 and 1965, and
about 5 percent per annum between 1966 and 1971) achieved despite the adverse
transitional effects of agrarian reform, sweeping nationalization measures,
uncertainties of the Middle East conflict and the adverse weather conditions
in the late 1960's which affected agricultural output.



- 3 -
7.        The prospects of Syria's econony are governed by the limited
mineral resources and in the agricultural sector (which is likely to re-
main the predominant sector for.many years) by the sparse rainfall. Agri-
culture should be able to achieve a reasonable rate of growth of up to
about 4 percent per annum during the next five years, provided energetic
steps are taken to supplement the wide ranging land reform measures in-
troduced in the past decade by a similar effort to expand agricultural
production. In this regard, the Government decision to give the highest
priority to the implementation of the Euphrates Basin development pro-
ject needs to be pursued as vigorously as possible, but due attention
needs also to be given to intensifying agricultural production in other
parts of the country. This would require, on the one hand,measures
to utilize as much as possible the available water resources and, on the
other3 measures to implement a comprehensive program of technological
innovation in the main producing regions, including steps to improve the
methods of water utlization and crop rotation, and to step up the intro-
duction of new varieties of Wheat, cotton and high value crops such as
fruit and vegetables and the expansion of amodern livestock industry.
In the industrial sector the Government is already actively engaged in
expanding production of petroleum from its limited resources to an optimum
level of about 15 million tons per year. Apart fram this.much will depend
on the success of the measures taken to modernize and expand the domestic
textile industry and develop its exports and the measures taken to explore
and develop other potential resources as effectively and as rapidly as
pO9S ible.
8.        An ambitious Third Five-Year Development Plan (1971-75) aims at
an annual growth rate of 8.2 percent. The distribution of investment in
the Plan appropriately reflects economic priorities, but the assumed growlth
rate is optimistic. If weather and political conditions are reasonably
favorable, an overall growth rate of about 7 percent per annum appears more
likely. The prospectsfor this would be further enhanced if peace were re-
stored to the area and if a greater contribution could be obtained from the
private sector. To finance the development plan it is estimated that
official capital inflows required during the plan period will amount to
some $370 million equivalent. The principal sources of aid are the Eastern
European countries and liMainland China, which provided about $190 million
equivalent during the second Five-Year Development Plan. Assuming that
aid from these countries will cover about half of this gap, which would be
consistent with the level of recent commitments, the financing required
from other sources would be of the order of $200 million. Arranging for
such a large volume of aid on appropriate terms is likely to be difficult
but a pre-condition for the successful accomplishment of the Development Plan.
9.        In view of the limited resource base of the Syrian econoTmy, par-
ticularly five years hence when expansion of the petroleum industry will
have reached its presently foreseeable limit, and the moderate scope for
increasing other exports, the econamic report underlines the importance of
the contribution to be made by the agricultural sector and particularly the
irrigable area and emphasizes the continuing dependence of Syria on a large
volume of external financial and technoial assistance. The report also



points to the need for Syria to explore and develop its potential resources
as effectively as possible and better mobilize domestic savings while at the
same time seeking to obtain external financial assistance on appropriate
terms, i.e. with average repayment periods of at least 15 to 20 years. With
a per capita income of about $230 Syria will continue to be dependent on
external aid for development. Although the present debt service ratio of
12.5 percent would permit some borrowing on conventional terms the,greater
part of Syria's borrowings should be on concessional terms.
PART III - THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
10.       The territorial settlements which followed W4orld War I left Syria
with a truncated and generally inadequate transport system for the needs of
the economy. At the time of independence, the railway network consisted of
1,079 km of disconnected lines of different gauges; the road network had
been substantially expanded during the French Mandate but according to very
austere standards; and deep water port facilities were insufficient, since
the region was served chiefly by ports outside Syria's territorial bounda-
ries. Syria's transport policy has consequently been shaped by the need
to adjust the transport system to the requirements of economic growth and
regional integration and to the objective of directing as much domestic
and inter-regional traffic as possible from foreign to Syrian ports. Pub-
lic investment in transport and communication has been high, averaging
nearly 20 percent of the Government's total expenditure during the Second
Five-)ar Plan fram 1966 to 1970.   The share of transport and communication
in the country's gross domestic product increased from 8.2 to 11.2 percent
during the same period. Transport development is concentrated on four
major projects which began in the Second Five-Year Plan (1966-70): (a) the
construction of an east-west railway link in northern Syria; (b) the im-
provement of the highway connecting the urban centers in the central regions
- partly financed with the first IDA credit; (c) the development of Tartous
as Syria's second deept water port after Lattakia wihich was expanded earlier;
and (d) the construction of a new international airport at Damascus which
is already completed. Past and present transport investment will lead to
changes in the modal distribution of freight and passenger traffic and will
confront the Government with the need for an effective transport coordina-
tion policy; a committee directly responsible to the Minister of Commiunica-
tions to advise on these matters will be created as part of the overaIl re-
organization of the Ministry which is expected shortly.
11.       The present road network in the country comprises about 8,100 km
of primary roads connecting the major urban centers and the capital with
the neighboring countries; 1,600 km of secondary and 1,800 km of tertiary
roads. The Ministry of Communications is responsible through its Directo-
rate of Highways and Bridges (DHB) for the design, construction and mainte-
nance of primary and secondary highways. Except for major construction
works which are undertaken by DHB, operations are handled by the 13 district
offices. In certain areas secondary roads are built by the semi-autonomous



- 5 -
agencies in charge of major irrigation and power projects and transferred
to DHB for maintenance. Ilaintenance of primary roads is expected to im-
prove following the creation of a central maintenance office and the pur-
chase of new road maintenance equipment provided for in the First Highway
project, as well as the completion of the vocational training program in
this field being carried out under the auspices of the UNDP.
12.       Road development has been concentrated on the improvement of the
existing network rather than the construction of new roads.  The backbone
of the system is the 530 km Damascus-Aleppo-Raqqa highway, which is under-
going major improvements under the First Highway project. The recently
completed 210 km road from Damascus to the Iraqi border primarily serves
through traffic from Beirut (and, in the future, Tartous) to Baghdad. The
second new main road constructed during the Second Five-Year Plan between
Homs and the phosphate mines near Palmyra connects the latter directly with
the export terminal at Tartous.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
13.       The proposed project consists of the improvement and/or con-
struction of the road links between Damascus and the Lebanese border towards
Beirut (about 40 km) and the Jordanian border towards Amman (about 85 km),
and the Tall-Kalak detour in the Homs-Tartous highway (about 28 km) which
will shorten the distance and avoid the crossing of Lebanese territory.
In addition, the project includes consulting services for the supervision
of construction of the above roads, and the preparation of a study of main-
tenance needs.  Finally, the project would include feasibility studies and,
if justified by these studies, detailed engineering for about 540 km of road.
A detailed description of the project is given in the report entitled"Apprai-
sal of the Second Highway Project" (PTR-94a) dated February 23, 1972 which is
being distributed separately. A Development Credit and Project Summary is
attached as Annex III, which includes a map.
l4.       Total cost of the project is estimated at $28.7 million equivalent
of which $13.8 million is foreign exchange. A 10 percent contingency allowance
has been included to cover possible construction quantity increases. The 20
percent escalation contingency to cover price increases has been estimated on
the basis of an average increase of about 5 percent per annum from preparation
of the estimates to completion of construction. A further 7 percent con-
tingency allowance is provided, because the political uncertainty in the
M4iddle East may induce contractors to quote higher prices because of the
risks involved. Details of costs are in Annex III. The proposed Credit
would cover the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project, account
being taken of the effects of the currency realigmments introduced in De-
cember 1971. Local currency costs will be met by the Government from budget-
ary allocations. Disbursements fram the Credit account will be made on the
basis of 52 percent of the cost of construction and the actual foreign ex-
change costs of consulting services.



- 6 -
15.       Execution of project works will be the responsibility of the
Directorate of HighwTays and Bridges. Construction will be carried out under
unit price contracts awarded after international bidding following normal
Association procedures. It is expected that the difficulties experienced in
the First Highway project in having construction works started promptly will
not occur again as detailed engineering for the roads included in the present
project has already been completed.  MoreoverI foreign contractors appear now
more interested in bidding for works in the Niddle East than wzas the case in
the years inmediately following the 1967 war. Nevertheless, the nature of
the works to be carried out on the roads between Damascus and the Lebanese
and Jordanian borders, namely reconstruction and realignment, does not allow
for as fast an implementation as would be the case for completely new high-
ways and the project is not expected to be completed before the end of 1977.
16.       The proposed project will conclude the reconstruction program of
the main highway system and constitutes about 35 percent of the total invest-
ment in highways for 1971-75. The project will complete the modernization
within Syria of the north/south trunk road connecting Turkey, Syria's largest
urban centers and main agricultural areas and Jordan, as well as the moderni-
zation of the east/west highway between Damascus and Lebanon, which is an im-
portant element of the regional system serving Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon,
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The latter has increased in importance since the
closure of the Suez Canal but would continue to be an essential and heavily
utilized link between these countries even if the canal were reopened.  Im-
provermentsto other sections of this system have either been studied in con-
sultat-ion with the Bank (in Lebanon) or financed by the Bank in the past (in
Iraq). Most of the quantifiable benefits attributable to the investment in
the project roads are road user savings from lower vehicle operating costs
on reconstructed roads; because of the multinational composition of traffic
in the country the benefits will to a certain extent accrue not only to Syria,
but to the region as a whole. Additional benefits are derived from the lower-
ing of road maintenance costs. Unquantified benefits attributed to the pro-
ject are time savings for passengers on business, faster turnover of shippers'
capital, and possibly generation of tourist traffic from neighboring countries.
17.       Internal economic returns for the various roads included in the
project range between 12 percent and 22 percent, and for the whole project
the IER is estimated at 18 percent. A sensitivity analysis shows that rea-
sonable variations in the major inputs in theanalysis have little effect on
the IER which is unlikely to fall for any of the roads below 10 percent.
Military traffic, estimated at present at about 15 percent of total traffic
on the Damascus-Lebanese border and Damascus-Jordanian border roads was
excluded fram the economic analysis.
18.       The Government's attempt to achieve a more balanced regional
growth will require further expansion of the highway system in the future.
The road studies included in the project will provide the necessary basis
for the Government to make sound investment decisions in this field, espe-
cially in the grain belt extending along the Turkish border. In view of the



- 7 -
recent Government policy of decentralizing.many  administrative responsibili-
ties, the maintenance study is needed to update and revise an earlier study
carried out under the First Highway project and to adjust accordingly orga-
nizational arrangements and maintenance needs.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Syrian Arab
Republic and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. Ratification of the Development
Credit Agreement by the legislature is required under the laws of the Syrian
Arab Republic and owing to the lengthy legislative process involved, a period
of six months has beem allowed after the date of signature for the fulfill-
ment of the conditions of effectiveness. Otherwise, the Development Credit
Agreement conforms to the usual pattern for highway projects.
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
