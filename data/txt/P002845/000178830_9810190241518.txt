REPUBLIC OF TOGO            FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
LOME WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:          The Republic of Togo
Beneficiary:       Regie Nationale des Eaux du Togo (RNET)
Amount:            SDR 10.9 million (US$12 million equivalent)
Terms:             Standard
a      Relending
Terms              11 percent interest; maturity of 24 years including four
years grace.  The Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Co-lenders:        Banque Ouest Africaine de Developpement (BOAD)
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC FUND)
Project
Description:       The project would increase the number of persons served by
the Lome water supply system, improve the quality of water,
and establish a sound policy and institutional basis for
future sector development. The entire population of Lome,
of which 55 percent have incomes at or below the poverty
level, would benefit from the project. Financing would be
provided for: (a) improvement of present production faci-
lities; (b) construction of eight new water production bore-
holes, 13 km of transmission.main, a neutralization plant, a
ground reservoir, a pumping station and a remote control
center; (c) reinforcement and extension of the distribution
network through the provision of 210 km of pipelines, 5,000
house connections and 33 standpipes; (d) consultant services
to carry out project preparation and other studies; (e) ve-
hicles and office and training equipment; and (f) technical
assistance.
Benefits
and Risks:         The project would have an economic rate of return of 6%,
based on existing covenanted tariffs, not counting consumer
surplus and positive externalities such as health impro-
vements. The primary benefit would be the increased
availability of high quality potable water in Lome.  The
number of persons with direct access to water would increase
by about 57,000 and an additional 24,000 would gain access
to standpipes. The population in general would benefit from
improved living standards and better sanitary conditions
which would lead to health improvements. Reforms in the
tariff structure would establish RNET's financial via-
bility. The major risk which might affect the project has
to do with RNET's inexperience as an implementing agency.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A LOME WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Devel-
opment Credit to the Republic of Togo for SDR 10.9 million (US$12.0 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance a Lome Water Supply
Project. Co-financing is expected from the French Caissse Centrale de Cooper-
ation Economique (CCCE) in a loan equivalent to US$4.1 million, from the
Banque Ouest Africaine de Developpement (BOAD) in a loan equivalent to US$3.5
million and from the OPEC Fund for International Development a loan equivalent
to US$4.0 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.       An economic report entitled "Togo:  Country Economic Memorandum"
(3416-TO) was circulated to the Executive Directors in January 1982. Its
assessment of the country's economic prospects, updated by recent Bank
missions, is reflected in the following paragraphs. Annex I contains basic
economic data and selected social indicators.
Introduction
3.       Togo is a small country (56,000 km2) with a population of about 2.5
million and a per capita GNP of US$363 (1980). Phosphate mining is the prin-
cipal source of foreign exchange earnings, accounting for nearly 40 percent of
export revenues in 1979/80, and receipts from phosphates represent about 30
percent of Government revenues. Political stability has prevailed since 1967,
when a military Government came to power. General Eyadema remains President,
but the Government has gradually become entirely civilian. Togo's external
policy, in the spirit of the Lome I and II Conventions, favors regional and
international cooperation.
Economic Performance
4.       Slow growth and increasing financial disequilibria have been the main
features of the Togolese economy since the late 1970s.  The slow growth
represents a deceleration from historical growth trends, and is the result of
1/   This section is essentially the same as Part I of the President's
Report for the Second Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas, Report
#P-3398-TO, November 4, 1982.



- 2 -
poor performance by many state enterprises and a persistent stagnation or
decline in the prices and quantities of exports. The 1974/75 boom in world
phosphate prices contributed to a substantial increase in export earnings and
Government revenues, and prompted the Government to adopt an ambitious
Development Plan for 1976-80. Nevertheless, growth in real GDP averaged less
than 3 percent per annum during the 1975-80 period, and was negative in
1981. The resource gap widened significantly through 1978 as expenditures
outpaced production. Gross domestic investment rose sharply to exceed 50
percent of GDP in 1978, but declined to an estimated 28 percent in 1981, as
fiscal constraints necessitated a cutback.
5.       The primary sector accounts for about 26 percent of GDP, but employs
80 percent of the labor force. Growth has been limited by inadequate invest-
ment, insufficient price incentives, and occasional droughts. The secondary
sector accounts for about 20 percent of GDP, with most industrial development
conducted by state enterprises. The recent growth in this sector is attribut-
able to phosphate rock production, which has, however, experienced dramatic
swings as a result of the 1974 price increase, a price decrease in 1975/76,
another increase in 1980, and the shifts in demand which accompanied these
price changes.  Large investments in industrial projects following the 1974/75
boom in phosphate prices have failed to contribute to an increase in GDP,
because of low or occasionally negative value added realized by several of the
new industrial units. The tertiary sector accounts for about 54 percent of
GDP. Togo has traditionally served as a regional trading center with an open-
door policy. Private investors have tended to favor commerce, real estate and
financial services over industrial ventures. A rapid increase in public ser-
vices led to a growth in government employment from 22,500 in 1975 to 37,000
in 1978; however, financial problems necessitated restraint from 1979 on.
Public Finance
6.       In 1975, current revenues of the Government nearly doubled to CFAF 33
billion as revenue from phosphates tripled from CFAF 4 to 12 billion. In
1976, the first year of the third Five-Year Plan, the Government embarked upon
its expansionary program just when the phosphate market weakened. However,
while phosphate prices fell, demand and output rose, and -- supplemented by
higher import duty receipts -- current revenue continued to rise. Although
current expenditures also increased rapidly, mainly due to a rising wage bill,
a sizeable surplus was left to finance both investment and debt service until
1978 when debt service obligations became overwhelming.
7.       Public investment (in current prices) of the administration, state
enterprises and agencies increased from CFAF 30 billion in 1975 to CFAF 88
billion in 1978, and continued at the still high but reduced rate of about
CFAF 67 billion in 1980, as disbursements were made on projects being imple-
mented. Although the 1976-80 Development Plan had placed more emphasis on
rural development than previous plans, during implementation major shortfalls
were experienced for this category while more expenditures than planned were
devoted to infrastructure, tourism and industry.
8.       In recent years, many state enterprises have been unable to pay the
debt service on their foreign borrowings, and the Treasury has had to shoulder



- 3 -
the responsibility. Arrears have accumulated as payments lagged. In 1979,
Togo agreed with the IMF on a financial program, and rescheduled its debt
through the Paris Club for 1979-80. A second round of debt rescheduling (for
1981-82) and a second standby arrangement with the IMF were obtained in early
1981. Even after debt rescheduling, the ratio of debt service to current
revenues was about 35 percent in 1981. Because of a decline in Government
revenues in 1981, a sizeable portion of the rescheduled debt service obliga-
tions was not met. The financial program with the IMF was abandoned, and the
debt rescheduling for 1982 through the Paris Club has been left in abeyance.
The Government is currently trying to meet the preconditions for a new program
with the IMF.
9.       To ease these severe fiscal restraints, Government has adopted tax
and customs reforms, increased the rates charged by some public utilities,
limited civil service hiring and salary increases, and reduced extrabudgetary
expenditures. In addition, public investments were reduced to about CFAF 35
billion in 1981 and are not expected to exceed CFAF 32 billion in 1982.
Structural Adjustment
10.      In parallel with efforts to reach an agreement with the IMF on a
financial stabilization program and its own budgetary and tax reforms, the
Government is pursuing an intensive dialogue with the Bank on the adoption of
a structural adjustment program. The main elements of such a program would
include: a) rehabilitation of state enterprises, b) promotion and diversifi-
cation of exports through stronger incentives in the rural sector and greater
value added in mining, and c) improved macro-economic management. Further
action on the proposed program is now awaiting agreement between Government
and the IMF on short-term stabilization measures.
Prospects for the 1982-85 Period
11.      In the 1982-85 period, the outlook is for average annual real GDP
growth of about 3.4 percent, i.e., an increase in GDP per capita of about one
percent per annum. The pursuit of less expansionary policies is expected to
lead to a substantially smaller resource gap and higher domestic savings.
12.      In agriculture there is a potential for increasing the output of both
food and export crops, and growth is projected to be about 3 percent annually,
assuming favorable weather conditions. An increase in food crop production
could be achieved through wider use of modern production techniques. Cotton
production is expected to increase at about 16 percent per year with continued
£        IDA support.  As a whole, the secondary sector is projected to expand at an
average annual rate of 4 percent. Output in mining could increase consider-
ably if transfers of funds from the phosphate mining company to the Treasury
are not excessive so that the company can increase its capacity, and if the
Bank-supported CIMAO clinker plant is able to overcome its current problems.
The outlook for the tertiary sector points to an annual growth rate of 3
percent. Because of the severe financial constraints, growth in public
services and civil service employment will have to be reduced to a bare
minimum. Growth in transport and commerce is, on the contrary, likely to
quicken.



- 4-
13.      Notwithstanding the debt rescheduling in 1981, and the possibility of
a third round of debt rescheduling in 1983, judicious policies will be
required during the next three years if rising debt service obligations are to
be met while a minimum development effort is maintained. Except for enclave-
type operations, there is no scope for additional borrowing on financial
markets, and new investments will be feasible only to the extent that grants
and concessionary loans are available. With the restoration of a sounder
financial situation, Togo's longer term development prospects remain promis-
ing, as there is considerable scope to better exploit the resource base of the
economy.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
14.      Bank Group lending to Togo totals fifteen credits amounting to
US$135.5 million, and two loans totaling US$53.0 million, for the CIMAO
regional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo, and one of US$49.5
million to CIMAO jointly and severally guaranteed by Ghana, Ivory Coast, and
Togo). Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of
September 30, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. In addi-
tion to the CIMAO projects, Bank Group lending has included roads; agriculture
(cocoa, coffee, cotton and food crops); education; technical assistance to the
Ministries of Plan, Rural Development, and Industry and State Enterprises; a
regional DEC operation; and feasibility studies for a phosphate fertilizer
project and a regional hydroelectric power project.
15.      IDA has made five credits for agricultural projects designed to
stimulate food crop production and to increase farm incomes through develop-
ment of cash crops such as cocoa, coffee and cotton. The four credits in the
road sector supported efforts to build up an efficient maintenance service,
upgrade the country's main and more heavily trafficked roads, and start a
comprehensive transport planning and coordination system. A separate project
for feeder road development provides for improvement works and maintenance
operations. The objective of the First Technical Assistance Project has been
to help the Government formulate sound investment and public finance poli-
cies. The second Project is providing continued technical assistance in
support of the implementation of an envisaged structural adjustment program.
An Engineering and Technical Assistance Credit will help to determine the
technical and economic viability of developing a phosphate fertilizer project
in Togo. A similar engineering credit will help to assess the viability of
the Nangbeto hydroelectric scheme (a regional project being planned jointly
with Benin).  An ongoing education project finances the construction of                       8
teacher training facilities, expansion of existing facilities and fellow-
ships. The proposed project complements the Bank's other operations in Togo
by providing support for essential infrastructure which will lead to immediate
improvements in standards of living and, at the same time, alleviate the drain
on public revenues. Under the project, the water supply company (RNET) would
become a financially viable entity capable of generating capital for future
investments.



-5-
16.      Togo's performance with respect to project implementaion and dis-
bursement is generally satisfactory. The Government is by now quite familiar
with the Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures. Delays are sometimes
encountered, however, because of the cumbersome administrative regulations
used in Togo to award public contracts. The Government is sensitive to this
problem and is working with the Bank to find appropriate means to simplify the
procedures.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Water Resources and Facilities
J
17.      The coastal area where Lome is located has a tropical humid climate
with two rainy seasons (one in May-July and one in October). Lom6 has an
average annual rainfall of 811 mm. Proceeding northward, the climate becomes
drier and the annual rainfall tends to concentrate into only one rainy season.
Most of the rural population relies on surface water or shallow wells. In
both cases, the water is of dubious quality, and the supply fluctuates season-
ally. A program of village wells is being financed by several external donors
including EDF, UNDP, UNICEF, and USAID. The smaller urban centers are
supplied partly with groundwater and partly with surface water which requires
costly treatment. The Government's investment strategy over the last decade
has focused on the 20 smaller urban centers. As a result, appropriate water
supply facilities have been constructed in 17 of these centers representing a
total population of 180,000.
18.      Lome enjoys excellent groundwater resources.  Although the capacity
of the existing production facilities is equal to the reliable yield of the
aquifer at Cacavelli from which they draw, other abundant groundwater
resources are available in the vicinity and will assure the water supply of
Lome in both the near and the long-term. Near the Cacavelli production
facilities, there is a research station for testing and storing toxic pesti-
cides. In the past, no problems have arisen, but if an accident or a leak
occurred at this facility, the groundwater could be contaminated. Under the
proposed project, the Government would relocate the research station by the
end of 1984 (Section 3.03 of Development Credit Agreement).
19.      The growth of the Lome water supply system has not kept pace with the
population which is currently estimated at 356,000. About 43 percent of
Lome's population is supplied with piped water, of which only one-third (about
53,000) is served by private connections and two-thirds (about 100,000) by
standpipes. Most of the remaining population is supplied through traditional
wells dug in the groundwater table, which is generally polluted. A small part
of the central area of Lome is served by a sewerage system built forty years
ago with only a few hundred connections. Consequently, most inhabitants rely
on on-site excreta disposal through septic tanks and latrines. The sludge is
periodically removed from the septic tanks by the municipality of Lome, which,
however, is not sufficiently equipped for this service. A storm drainage
system covers only part of the city. The Government has fully endorsed the
objectives of the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade.



-6-
At present, because of the country's financial and managerial constraints,
priority is being given to water supply and only limited action is planned in
sanitation.
Institutional Arrangements
20.      The Department of Hydraulics and Energy (DHE) in the Ministry of
Public Works, Energy and Water Resources (MPW) is responsible for rural water
supply. The Regie Nationale des Eaux du Togo (RNET), which would be the
beneficiary of the proposed credit, is responsible for water supply and
sewerage in Lome and the 17 smaller urban centers. RNET operates under the
tutelage of MPW with additional supervision from the State Secretariat for
Industry and State Enterprises (SISE). By a statute of 1964, RNET was esta-
blished as an autonomous body with responsibility for implementation of
investments as well as operation and maintenance of water supply and public
sewerage systems. However, until recently, RNET was solely an operating
agency for investments which were implemented and recorded in DHE. The
statutes of RNET are now being reviewed. It is expected that a revised
statute affirming RNET's legal and financial autonomy, subject to the general
rules applicable to state enterprises, will be proposed in the near future.
The transfer of all urban water supply investments to RNET as equity would be
completed by June 30, 1984 (Section 3.05 of Development Credit Agreement). As
a condition of effectiveness, the executive board of RNET would invest its
Director General with the powers necessary to assure efficient and flexible
day to day management. Under the proposed project, RNET would for the first
time be the executing agency for large scale investments. After successful
implementation of the project, RNET should be capable of assuming responsi-
bility for future sector development in terms of both investments and
operation. To assist the Togolese Government in the future development of the
water and sanitation sector within an appropriate institutional framework, an
organizational study of the sector would be included under the project.
21.      RNET's policies are made, and its operations controlled by a super-
visory board of directors composed of representatives of the various minis-
tries which have an interest in the sector. Its Chief Executive is the
Director General. Four departments: Projects and Works, Operations, Admin-
istration, and Finance are each led by a director and sub-divided into smaller
task-specific units. Most mid-level managers are recent graduates with rele-
vant education who lacked experience prior to joining RNET but who have grown
in their professional skills with the development of RNET.  Because of the
relatively short distances in the country, headquarters staff make a habit of
meeting with all outstation managers at three-month intervals, a practice
which ensures close personal liaison between the desk managers and the field
staff. In addition, the dedication of the present Director General appears to
have created a general environment of motivation and job satisfaction. The
existing organization seems appropriate for its present role. However with
increasing activities and responsibilities, RNET may need to examine and
refine its organizational structure. To this end, a brief management study
would be undertaken in connection with the project. IDA would be given an
opportunity to comment on RNET's plans for further organizational development
(Section 3.04 of Project Agreement).



- 7 -
22.      While operations in Lome remained stagnant for the past few years,
RNET was called upon to operate an increasing number of smaller waterworks in
urban centers throughout the country. This extension of activity created a
need for skilled personnel which was not available in the labor market. RNET
has overcome this problem by sending all of its engineers to SODECI (Societe
de Distribution d'Eau de la Cote d'Ivoire) in Abidjan for training courses in
water supply operations. Some of the senior staff have been trained in France
at CEFIGRE (Centre de Formation Internationale a la Gestion des Ressources en
Eau). A shortage is now felt particularly at the overseer and operator
levels, for which training is generally provided on-the-job. To relieve this
shortage, a more intensive training program would be established by June 30,
1983 (Section 3.05 of Project Agreement). Its various components will be
financed by FAC, KfW, UNDP and GTZ. The Director of Administration has been
assigned responsibility for training and monitoring. In addition, FAC is
financing a systems analyst. With the provision under the proposed project of
a management adviser, RNET's needs for technical assistance and training would
be completely covered.
RNET's Finances
23.      In the past, tariffs were designed to cover operating expenditures
but, because of lax billing and collection practices, RNET experienced
operational losses which were balanced by occasional Government subsidies.
The Government financed all investments and serviced the related debts without
collecting compensating revenues from the consumers.  Several steps have been
taken to rectify these problems. The Government and RNET have recently
adopted a policy of gradually moving toward full-cost recovery through
tariffs. In March 1982 tariffs were increased by 30 percent. Another tariff
increase of about 50 percent will be implemented no later than January 1,
1984. This is expected to make water supply operations financially viable.
Under the project, tariffs would continue to be adjusted so as to attain, by
1984 and thereafter, a rate of return of at least 5 percent on notionally
revalued fixed assets (Section 4.03 of Project Agreement). Other recent
actions which have improved RNET's financial situation include conversion to a
commercial cost accounting system, prompter billing and stricter collection
procedures. Whereas the Government pays promptly and in full for consumption
on administrative premises, it has been difficult for RNET to collect payment
from local authorities for public standpipes. Under the proposed project, the
Government would ensure that these payments will be made (Section 3.02 of
Development Credit Agreement). As a result of the proposed tariff and other
improvements in financial management, RNET would be able to contribute US$4.0
million to the proposed project and would establish a capacity for future
reinvestments.  The Government would consequently be relieved of this burden.
Pricing Policies
24.      The current tariff structure does not distinguish among consumer
groups but takes into account the limited financial capacity of the urban poor
through a graduated schedule: a very low rate is charged for the first 1Om3
per month, a quantity estimated to cover the basic needs of an average family,
and a moderately higher rate is applied to all additional consumption. A
uniform tariff structure is applied throughout the country, so that revenues



- 8 -
in Lome subsidize the higher production costs prevailing in the smaller urban
centers. An adjusted tariff structure which would be implemented under the
project would continue to favor the urban poor, but would aim at recovery of
long-term economic costs from large commercial and industrial consumers. All
nonindustrial consumers would continue to pay a low rate for the first 1Om3
per month; an intermediate rate would apply to consumption of 10m3 to 30m3;
and all consumption in excess of 30m3 per month including all industrial
consumption would be subject to a higher rate designed to approach long-term
marginal costs.  To make piped water widely available to the population and to
increase its revenues, RNET will begin to provide free house connections for
normal domestic supply daring 1983. The connection costs (about CFAF 75,000
or US$220 per connection) would be recovered through the tariff structure.
However, to protect RNET from possible unpaid bills, a deposit of CFAF 25,000
(US$74), the equivalent of almost one year's consumption, would be levied at
the time of connection.
25.      Several industries in Lome extract water directly from the ground-
water table. This practice will most likely result in higher costs for public
water supply in the future as additional sources must be tapped at progres-
sively greater distances. For this reason, the Government would take action
to prevent any extraction of water which would adversely affect the ground-
water table and would introduce no later than January 1, 1984, a levy on such
industrial water use; this levy would be collected and retained by RNET
(Section 3.04 of Development Credit Agreement and Section 2.04 of Project
Agreement).
Past Bank Assistance to the Sector
26.      The proposed project would be the first Bank-assisted project in the
sector. It would provide a sound basis for expanding activities on a country-
wide scale. Management, institutional arrangements, and technical performance
would be strengthened and future sector needs and priorities would be identi-
fied.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Objectives and Summary Description
27.      The proposed project would be the most important action to be under-
taken by the Government in the urban water supply sector during the 1981-85
period.  The objectives of the project are to increase the number of persons
served by the Lome water supply system, to improve the quality of the water,
and to establish the basis for future sector development. In order to achieve
these objectives, financing would be provided for:
(a) improvement of existing production facilities;
(b) construction of eight new water production boreholes, 13 km of
transmission main, a neutralization plant, a ground reservoir, a
pumping station and a remote control center;



-  9 -
tc) reinforcement and extension of the distribution network through the
provision of 210 km of pipelines, 5,000 house connections and 33
standpipes;
(d) consultant services to carry out (i) final design and preparation of
tender documents relating to the project-financed waterworks,
(ii) final design and preparation of tender documents for a possible
follow-up project, (iii) sector and management studies and (iv) a
feasibility study of the Lome sanitation system;
(e) vehicles and office and training equipment; and
(f) technical assistance.
28.      The facilities to be installed through this project represent the
first phase of investments outlined in the UNDP-funded Lome Water Supply
Master Plan. They have been designed with due consideration for future
extensions foreseen as second and third phase waterworks in the Master Plan.
The Project Area and Population Coverage
29.      In 1981, the population of Lome was estimated at 356,000.  Growing at
an average annual rate of about 4.5 percent, it is expected to reach 468,000
by 1987. Currently, about 15 percent of Lome's population is served by domes-
tic connections; 29 percent uses public standpipes; more than 50 percent
relies almost entirely on water from traditional wells which are found in
practically every household; and about 3 percent depends on rainwater, truck
supply, or surface resources. As a result of the proposed project and the
introduction of the free house connection policy, domestic connection coverage
is expected to increase to about 24 percent of the population by 1987. A
large segment of the population, 28 percent, would continue to rely on public
standpipes. The remainder of the population would participate in an informal
system of private "neighborhood" vendors, which already exists to some extent,
and whereby households without piped water buy drinking water from households
with piped water. As these buyers would continue to use household wells for
non-drinking water purposes, the volume and cost of water bought by individual
households from neighborhood vendors would not be exorbitant.
30.      About 55 percent of the population of Lome has an income at or below
the poverty level.  However, there are virtually no income-strata-oriented
residential areas or slums. Thus all project-related construction would
benefit the poverty population. Moreover, the densification of service to be
carried out under the project would help prevent the growth of urban fringe
slum areas. The 35 new standpipes to be installed would benefit the poor
primarily. The tariff and connection policies discussed in para 23 are
designed to promote participation by the poor, particularly those living in
compounds which are shared by an average of three households. By the end of
the decade the proposed tariffs would allow an average sized compound of three
families (14 persons) to consume 21 m3 per month (50 liters per capita per
day) for a total monthly cost of CFAF 2,715 (1981 prices). This amounts to
CFAF 905 (US$2.66) per family or about 5 percent of the monthly poverty level
income of CFAF 20,000 (US$59).  The poverty population would represent an



- 10 -
important part of the project beneficiaries, and it is estimated that by 1987
they would account for about 22 percent of total domestic water consumption in
Lome. Overall, about US$10 million, or 36 percent of the project cost, would
directly benefit the urban poor.
Project Preparation and Implementation
31.      Final design activities and preparation of tender documents for the
project waterworks began in November 1982. RNET and the French consulting
firm, SAFEGE, negotiated an agreement for such consulting services in the
amount of US$441,000 based on terms of reference reviewed by the Bank. Upon
request of the Government, IDA agreed to provide this amount as a PPF advance.
32.      RNET would be the implementing agency of the project and would be
assisted by a team of consultants which would be responsible for supervision
of the works. This consultant team would be employed no later than the date
on which works are initiated (Section 2.02(b) of Project Agreement).
Construction is expected to begin in late 1983 and to be substantially
completed by the end of 1987. RNET, which has already proved its competence
in this field of activity, would lay a part of the pipelines and carry out all
of the house connections and the installation of standpipes. The remainder of
the construction work would be contracted as described in para 36.
Project Costs and Financing
33.      The total estimated cost of the project is US$27.6 million including
physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange cost, US$21.8 million,
or 79 percent of the total, includes both direct and indirect foreign exchange
components. The cost estimates are the preliminary design cost estimates
based on end 1982 unit prices in accordance with data contained in the UNDP
funded Lome Water Supply Master Plan (May 1982). An 8 percent allowance for
physical contingencies has been added to the base costs. Price contingencies
amounting to 46 percent of base costs were estimated on the basis of a con-
struction profile of 4 years starting in 1983/1984 and an expected price
escalation for both local and foreign costs of between 11.5 percent and 12
percent annually. Project investments would be free from import duties and
taxes.
34.      External-financing would amount to US$23.0 million or 83 percent of
project costs.  The financing plan would be as follows:                                           0
Interest/
Source                Amount       Maturity      Grace        Commission
IDA            US$12.0 million   50 yrs        10 yrs          0.75%
CCCE           US$ 4.1 million   20 yrs         4 yrs          5.0%
BOAD           US$ 3.5 million   13 yrs         3 yrs         11.0
OPEC Fund      US$ 4.0 million   17 yrs         5 yrs          1.0%
RNET           US$ 4.0 million
Total          US$27.6 million



- 11 -
35.      The CCCE would lend directly to RNET.  IDA, BOAD and the OPEC Fund
would lend to the Government, which, to facilitate loan administration, would
execute a single on-lending agreement with RNET. Overall on-lending terms of
11 percent interest and a reimbursement period of 24 years, including 4 years
of grace9 would be appropriate. BOAD and the OPEC Fund have agreed to this
arrangement. The on-lending agreement would be denominated in CFAF and the
Government would assume the foreign exchange risks.  The execution of such an
on-lending agreement would be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section
5.02(a) of Development Credit Agreement). Fulfillment of conditions precedent
to effectiveness of the BOAD, CCCE and OPEC Fund loan agreements would also be
a condition of effectiveness (Section 5.02(b) of Development Credit
Agreement).
Procurement
36.      Except for a few small contracts, procurement of civil works, pipe-
lines and equipment would be carried out by ICB in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines for the portion of the project to be funded by IDA,
BOAD and OPEC Fund (IDA contribution US$ 9.1 million). The portion of civil
works, pipelines and equipment to be financed by CCCE would be procured in
accordance with its guidelines. Eligible domestic bidders would be afforded a
preference of 7.5 percent for works and 15 percent for goods under ICB
procurement. Contracts for purchase of plant, equipment and vehicles,
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 each and contracts for civil works
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 each would be procured on the basis of
local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to IDA. These contracts
would be subject to a maximum aggregate of US$0.5 million (IDA contribution
US$0.3 million). Contracts for the construction of works would be split so as
to take into account not only technical criteria, but also the contribution of
each co-financier to the project's funding.
37.      Consultants for the supervision of project works, preparation of the
final design and tender documents for a follow-up project and the various
studies would be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use
of^ Cbnsultants and on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (IDA con-
tribution US$1.1 million). A total of 255 man-months, at US$7,800 per month
including fees and expenses, of foreign consultants and technical assistance
is projected to be required. Consultants for supervision of works and a
management adviser would be financed by CCCE and procured according to its
guidelines. IDA financing for the preparatory program (US$441,000) will be
used to repay the PPF advance. A total of US$1.8 million (IDA contribution
US$1.5 million) is unallocated.
Disbursements
38.      The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed in the following manner:
(a)  72 percent of foreign exchange cost of production facilities,
transmission lines and pipelines for water production from the
Maestrichien aquifer;
(b) 72 percent of foreign exchange cost and 90 percent of local cost of
improving utilization conditions at Cacavelli, and construction of a
remote control center;



- 12 -
(c) 72 percent of foreign exchange cost of improving and expanding water
distribution facilities through the installation of ductile cast iron
pipes, the installation of 5,000 house connections and the
construction of 33 standpipes;
(d) 72 percent of foreign exchange cost and 90 percent of local cost of
vehicles and office and training equipment;
(e) 72 percent of foreign exchange cost and 90 percent of local cost of
consultants for studies and preparation of a possible second project;
(f) 100 percent of the cost of refunding the Project Preparation Advance.
Disbursements for all of the above except (f) would be pari-passu with the
OPEC Fund.  Statements of expenditures will be used for certain disburse-
ments. The Association is satisfied that RNET has the necesssary capability
to prepare such statements.
Reporting Requirements and Audit
39.      RNET would report regularly on the progress of project execution and
on the implementation of its training program (Section 2.06(b) of Project
Agreement). RNET would also prepare a Project Completion Report (Section 2.06
(d) of Project Agreement). An annual financial report and an audit report
would be submitted to the Association within 6 months of the close of each
fiscal year (Section 4.02(b) of Project Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
40.      The major risk which might affect the project has to do with RNET's
inexperience as an implementing agency. This risk has been dealt with through
the provision of consultants to supervise works and of a technical assistant
to the Director General. The appropriate managing powers would be delegated
to the Director General and an understanding has been reached with the Govern-
ment on the need to revise RNET's statutes in order to ensure its autonomy.
The primary benefit of the proposed project would be the increased avail-
ability of high quality potable water in Lome. As a result of the project the
number of persons with direct access to water would increase by about 57,000
and an additional 24,000 would have access to standpipes. The entire popula-
tion would benefit from the improved water quality. The progressive tariff
structure would establish RNET's financial viability and contribute to a more
balanced income distribution among the different groups of consumers and
between Lome and the smaller centers.
41.      Taking into account, as a proxy of benefits, the revenues associated
with the incremental water sales, and as costs, the capital and recurrent
costs associated with the project, the economic rate of return is estimated at
6 percent based on existing convenanted tariffs. This figure understates the
full benefits of the project, as it does not capture consumers' surplus or
positive externalities such as improved living standards and better sanitary
conditions which could lead to health improvements.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Togo
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
RNET, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
43.      Features of the draft Development Credit Agreement of special
interest are listed in Section III of Annex III. Special conditions of credit
effectiveness would be the decision by the executive board of RNET to invest
the Director General with necessary powers, the execution of an on-lending
agreement between the Government and RNET, and the fulfillment of conditions
precedent to effectiveness of the BOAD, CCCE and OPEC Fund loan agreements.
44.      I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

E.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 810     Feeder Roads Project; US$5.8 million; Credit of June 28,
1978; Effectiveness Date: March 2, 1979; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The project consists of a four-year program for the improvement and
maintenance of about 1,000 km of feeder roads, technical assistance to estab-
lish a Feeder Roads Unit in charge of the program, and consultant services to
study a follow up feeder roads program. At the end of 1982, the project was
being wound down as most of the IDA credit had been disbursed. Due to lower
output than expected from the brigades, institutional difficulties and a
shortage of local funds resulting from the difficult budgetary situation in
Togo which was alleviated only in part by an increase in IDA disbursement
percentage, only about 530 km of feeder roads have been constructed. By March
1983, US$4.3 million had been disbursed, leaving an undisbursed balance of
US$1.5 million. Part of this will be needed for outstanding commitments and
for completion of certain remaining structures; the rest will be reserved for
maintenance works.
Credit No. 930     Technical Assistance Project; US$2.2 million; Credit of
June 22, 1979; Effectiveness Date: October 23, 1979;
Closing Date: February 28, 1986.
The project provides for two advisers in the Ministry of Planning for
a three-year period each and for short-term consultants to carry out specific
project-related and macroeconomic studies. The first adviser is to counsel on
general economic and public finance questions, while the second adviser is to
assist in selecting major new investments and in finding ways of improving
existing large projects. The assignment of the first adviser has been
extended for a fourth year until August 1983. The second adviser began his
assignment in September 1982.
Credit No. 945     Second Cocoa and Coffee Development Project; US$14.0
million; Credit of July 23, 1979; Effectiveness Date:
July 11, 1980; Closing Date:  December 31, 1985.
The project is a continuation of the First Coffee/Cocoa Project. It
provides for the planting and maintenance of a further 7,500 ha of coffee and
4,000 ha of cocoa as well as services, applied research, associated food crop
development, and construction of 300 km of feeder roads. Coffee production is
proceeding satisfactorily. The cocoa program has fallen far behind appraisal
targets due to technical problems, a lack of farmer interest, and diseases
affecting the cocoa plants. These problems have been examined by a specialist
in cocoa cultivation. Possible solutions, including the cancellation of
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors on the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any pro-
blems and actions being taken to remedy them. They should be read with
the understanding that they do not present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

the cocoa component of the credit, are being considered. Another problem
facing the project has been the poor rate of medium-term credit recovery from
participating farmers. The Government has taken steps to solve this problem
by using marketing channels for credit recovery.
Credit No. 969      Project Preparation Credit to Banque Ouest Africaine de
Development; US$3.0 million; Credit of January 25, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: April 29, 1980; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The objective of the project is to finance feasibility and detailed
engineering studies for regional development projects. The project is
proceeding satisfactorily.
Credit No. 1018    First Education Project; US$11.0 million; Credit of
September 15, 1980; Effectiveness Date: January 27, 1981;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Construction of training facilities is progressing satisfactorily.
One of the four project institutions became operational during the last
quarter of 1982, and the three others are expected to become operational by
October 1983. Project management continues to perform well, but should focus
on the timely implementation of the educational programs, the institutional
budget, and the technical assistance. Despite an initial lag in disburse-
ments, the project is expected to be completed on schedule.
Credit No. 1139    Fourth Highway Project; US$20.0 million; Credit of
October 28, 1981; Effectiveness Date: September 2, 1982;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
This project provides for a three-year training program for road
maintenance personnel; procuremnt of road maintenance equipment and spare
parts; pavement of 157 km of road; pre-investment studies for 57 km of road;
and technical assistance to improve transport planning and coordination, as
well as railway operations. Following a delay in project effectiveness,
implementation of all project items has now been started and progress is
generally satisfactory. Due to a difficult budgetary situation the Government
has requested that IDA and OPEC Fund increase their disbursement percentages
for civil works.
Credit No. 1169    Phosphate Fertilizer Engineering Project; US$5.7 million;
Credit of October 28, 1981; Effectiveness Date:  May 21,
1982; Closing Date: August 31, 1983.
The purpose of this project is to determine the technical and
economic viability of developing a phosphate fertilizer project to manufacture
for export phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizers from the Dagbati deposits
and from recovered slimes. Studies and tests comprising the first phase of
the project are nearing completion and show promising results. The final
feasibility study, which will be executed during the second phase of the
project, is scheduled to be completed by December 1983.

Credit No. 1190    Power Engineering and Technical Assistance Project; US$2.0
million; Credit of January 21, 1982; Effectiveness Date:
December 29, 1983; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
This credit is financing the preparation of the Nangbeto hydro-
electric project, a joint undertaking involving Togo and Benin. Funds may
also be used to strengthen the power sector institutions in each country,
particularly in the areas of planning and accounting.
Credit No. 1270    Second Technical Assistance Project; US$3.5 million;
Credit of July 2, 1982; Effectiveness Date: November 15,
1982; Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
The project provides an Investment Programmer for two years who will
work in the Ministry of Planning along with the Project Adviser financed under
the First Project. In addition, a planning unit and an applied research
coordination unit are being created in the Ministry of Rural Development with
the assistance of a planning expert, a research coordinator, and short-term
consultants. Two experts are being provided to the State Secretariat for
Industry and State Enterprises to introduce program-contracts and analytical
studies. Additional consultants will be provided on a short-term basis for
studies connected with the implementation of economic adjustment and financial
stabilization measures. All of the medium-term exerts have been recruited and
have begun their assignments in Lome.
Credit No. 1303    Second Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas; US$23.5
million; Credit of February 18, 1983; Closing Date:
October 1, 1988.
The project would follow the First Rural Development Project in
Cotton areas and will be executed by the Societe Togolaise du Coton
(SOTOCO). The purpose of the project is to expand the production of food
crops and cotton grown by smallholder farmers. Financing would be provided
for extension and animal traction services, applied research and seed multi-
plication, farmer inputs, reconstruction of feeder roads, village water
supply, and technical assistance. The credit has not yet been declared
effective.
