MEMORANDUM TO THE EXCUTIV  DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Togo
Lome Water Suply P_r_oect lCredit 1354-TO)
Attached is the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Togo -
Lome Water Supply Project (Credit 1354-TO)" prepared by the Africa Regional
Office. The Borrower did not provide Part II.
The project was the Bank's first t.volvement in the water supply
sector in Togo. As such, its objectives aid targets were over-ambitious. In the
end, physical achievements exceeded expectations (partly due to savings and
appreciation of the US dollar) buc financial results fell far short. Due to the
government's refusal to permit adequate tariff increase and the non payment of
its bills, particularly the low tariff standpipe consumption which is free to the
consumer, the water utility's finances continue to be precarious. Pinancial
covenants were not complied with and the undoubted improvemeAnts in management and
operational efficiency could not compensate for the revenue shortfalls.
A performance contract signed between the Government and the water entity,
in 1991, promises further improvement in the agency and a more realistic approach
by the government. For this reason and because of the significant improvement
in sector management and service provisions, and notwithstanding the current
financial shortcomings, the overall outcome of the project is judged
satisfactory. Institutional development is rated substantial and sustainability
as uncertain.
The PCR is adequate in describing the project experience but short on
performance and financial data. No audit is proposed at this time.

LOE WATER SUPPLY PROECT
(CREDIT 1354-TO)
PREFACE
Thi is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the L ome Water Supply Project in Togo for
which credit 1354 - TO in the amount of SDR 10.9 million was approved on May 3, 1983. The
credit becme eective on April 9, 1984 and was closed on December 31, 1992, two years behind
schedule. The last disbumen was on June 16, 99Q3; 94% of the credit has been disbrsed, and
the balance of about SDR 205,000 will be cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infratuct   Options Division of the Occidental and
Cntral Aftica Deparment (APFIN). There was no completion mission. At the time this report was
issued, the Borrower has not submitted Part H.
The PCR is based on the Sta Appmaisal Report, the Report amn Recommendation of the
President to the Executive Directors, the Credit and Project Agreemes, supervision reports,
correspondene between the Bank and the Borrower and the Beneficiary, inte    Bank memoranda,
and inteviews of Bank staff who have been associated with the Project over the years. The PCR
rews the situation of the Project and implementilg agency up to the last few months of 1992, and
therefore does not take into account the impact that recent political events may have had on the
Project and the financial situation of the implementing agency.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TOGO
LONE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(CREDIT 1354-TO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objetves
i.           The immediate objective of this project was to reinforce the Lomd water supply
system in order to increase the number of persons served by the system and to improve the quality
of the water. The long-tern objective of this first Bank-assisted project in the sector was to establish
a sound basis for expanding activities on a country-wide scale dtrough the stregthenng of
management, institutional aements and technical performance, and the identification of futue
sector needs and priorides. Under the Project, RNET would become a fincially viable entity
capable of generating capital for future investments (paragraph 6).
ImleenatonExperienc
ii.          The Project was wel prepared and adequate arrangements were made for construction
supervision. Despite delays in the effectiveness of the IDA credit, the first phase program of works
was completed as schediled by the end of 1987, at a cost about 30 percent less than the appraisal
esimate. After cofinanciers agreed in prnciple that the savings could be used to finance additional
works, some time was lost in the preparation of a complementay program which started in early
1991 and was completed by the end of 1992. In the end, total project costs were the same as the
appraisal estimate, but for a significantly bigger program of works. RNET financed about 15 percent
of total project costs out of its own resources. By and large, RNET and its consultants did a
professional job in handling the implementation of the project, including procurement and
constuction supervision (paragraphs 10 to 15).
Results
iii.         The Project was successful in meeting its immediate and long-term objectives.
Physical targets were exceeded. Over the last ten years, water consumption in Lom6 increased by
about 60 percent, the number of connections more than doubled and the number of people served by
RNET's network increased by about 75 percent. However, because of the continued increase in
population, the percentage of the population served is not 100 percent as forecast at appraisal, but
about 60 percent (paragraphs 16 and 23).
iv.          Some of the financial targets were not achieved; in partclar, despite its test efforta
to control costs, RNET did not comply with the rate of return covenant, mainly becase of
government's reluctance to approve tariff increases in a tmely manner. The share of water sales to
government (particularly for standpipes), which were billed at the lowest rate, kept increasing. In
addition, starting in 1988, government experienced difficulties in paying its bills, and RNET was
unable to service its debt to Govemment and did not pay its suppliers and contractors as promptly
as it used to. The tariff adjtment and the performance contract of March 1991, as well as the



- iii. -
offsetting anrangements implemnted in November 1992, addressed the above-mtioned problems.
Despite all these difficulties, RNET managed to finance out of its own funds a significa  percntage
of the cost of the project and of its total invstmn  progrm (pagraphs 17 to 20).
v.           The Project supported RNET's efforts to stenthen its operations and management.
RNET made good use of the consulting services and technical assistance provided under the Project
and by other donors. RNET has been well mnaed, its facilities are opeated efficiently, and thete
has been. a substantial icrease in the number of towns and villages served by RNET. In short, the
Project did establish a sound basis for expanding activities on a country-wide scale. However, the
planned transfer of all urban water supply facilities to RNET and the correspondin increase in
RNET's capital did not take place (parahs 21 and 22).
vi.          The willingness and ability of prvate consuers to pay for water ensure the
sustainability of the Project, provided that RNET is allowed to operate in a professional man  free
from political interference and is not denied the financial resources necesary to operate and mainain
its facilities. The performance contract between the goverment and RNET provides a useful
framework to enble RNET to remain fncially viable as it emphasizes increang the dersfi on
of the network, reducing the number of standpipes, increasing the number of bause cOeons, and
refers to government's obligations to pay its water bills in a dmely maer and allow RNET to adjust
tariffs. The policy of free water from standpipes must also be dicontined as bas been done by
neighboring countries (paragrapbs 24 and 25).
fluig and Lessn  Leaned
vii.         The Lom6 Water Supply Projec is a good project which has generally been carried
out with due diligence and efficiency by RNET. The performance of the Bank and Government has
been satisfactry, although te Government did not always pay its biUls promptly and did not comply
with its obligations under the Development Credit Agreement to take all necessary measures
(including, but not limited to, adjustment in RNET's tariffs and tariff strumre) to enable RNET to
earn an annual rate of return of at least 5 percen (paragrahs It, 17 and 26 to 29).
viii.        The experiences with this successfil project confirmed that it is possible to implement
a project efficiently and in a timely manner if: (a) the project is well prepued and (b) the
mnagement of the implementing agency is competent and has credibility vis-i-vis poteni
authorities. It also demonstrated that, if properly planned and managed, technical assistance can be
productive and lead to a succe    transfer of management and operating kmow-how from expaiae
to national staff. Finally, the Project is another ilusration of the fragity of financial viability if all
the parties involved do not comply with the basic principles of finanial discipline.

Sector                    Water Supply and Sanitation
B. BACKGROUND
1.           At the time of the appraisal of the Project, the R6gie Nationale des Eaux du Togo
(RNET) was responsible for the operation and maintenace of urban water supply systems, e.g. in
Lom6 and in 17 smaller urban centrs. Three other centers were still not provided with water supply
facilides. Rural water supply was the responsibility of the Directorate of Hydraulics and Energy
(DHE) in the Ministry of Public Works, Mines, Energy and Water Resources (MPW). RNET
operated under the tutelage of MPW and under additional supervision of the State Secretariat for
Industry and State Enterprises (SISE). RNET was also responsible for the operation and maitence
of the Lome sewage system which served a very limited area of Lom6 and was the only one in Togo.
2.           Lomn enjoyed excellent ground water resources. However, fture boreholes will have
to be located progressively farther away from the city and consequently lead to increasing investment
costs. A simple neutralization treatment was sufficient to produce water of an acceptable quality.
In 1982, about 43% of Lom6's population was supplied with piped water, out of which only one-
third (about 53,000) served by private connections and two-thirds (about 100,000) by standpipes.
Most of the remaining population was supplied through traditional wells dug in the shallow water
table, which is generally polluted. The smaller urban centers were supplied partly with groundwater
and partly with surface water requiring a complete and costly treatment. Most of the rural population
was supplied through traditional sources (shallow wells, ponds, rivers) with dubious water quality and
without guartee of peremial supply.
3.           RNET's nucleus was created by decree in 1959 as the Lom6 water supply authority
and then extended to national responsibilides by law in 1964. A statute from 1964 defining it as a
legally and financially autonomous body was approved by decree in 1965 but never filly applied.
A revised statute affirming RNET's legal and financial autonomy, subject to the general rules
applicable to state enterprises, was expected in the near future. For the project, RNET would for
the first time be the executing agency for large scale investments. RNET had a dedicated general
manager who created a general environment of motivation and job satisfaction. In the early 1980's
RNET converted to a commeil accountig system, strengthened its efforts to bill regularly and



.2-
collect revemnes and improved its finmncial situation, with support from the govermenm which
approved an overdue tariff increase and conmmitted itself to a policy of futl cost recovery in the
future. All connections and standpipes were metered, and the technical efficiency of the system of
about 80% was remarkable.
4.           The govermnt fully endorsed the objectives of the international drinking water
supply and sanitation decade. Because of the country's financial and manageral constraints, priority
was being given to water supply and only limited action was planned in saniation.
5.           The government has been implementing water supply systems in most of the urban
centers oeer the lst decade. In Lom6, howver, the water supply system has not kept pace witi the
increse in populaion; the connection rate is low, and the exising production and disibution
facilities are inadequa and cannot satisfy the water demand.
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
6.           Project Objectives. The inmediate objective of this project was to reinforce the
Loam  water supply system in order to increase the number of perso  served by the system and to
improve the quality of the water. The long-term objective of this first Bank - assisted project in the
sector was to establish a sound basis for expanding activities on a country-wide scale through the
strengthening of management, institutional arrangements and techical performance and the
idenification of future sector needs and prorities. The project complemented the Bank's other
operations in Togo by providing support for essendal infrastructure leading to immedia
improvements in standards of living and, at the same time, alleviating the drain on public revenues.
Under the project, RNET would become a financially viable entity capable of generating capital for
fure investments.
7.           ProJect Description. The project comprised the following component:
(a)   improvement of existing production facilities:
(b)   construction of twenty exploration boreholes and eight new water production
boreholes, pipelines connecting the eight production boreholes with the transmission
line, 13 km of transmission mains, a neutralization plant, a ground reservoir, a
pumping station and a remote control center;
(c)   reinforcement and extension of the distribution network through the provision of 210
km of pipclines, 5,000 house connections and 33 standpipes;
(d)   consultant services to carry out (i) final design and preparation of tender documents
relating to the project-fianced waterworkcs, (ii) final design and preparation of tender
documents for a possible follow-up project, (iii) sector and management studies and
(iv) a feasibility study of the Lom6 sanitation system;

(e)   vehicles and office and training equipment; and
(f)   technical assistance.
D. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
8.           Back in 1974 the government expressed interest in having Bank financing for water
supply, but it is only in 1979/1980 that the bank seriously considered such financing with the
undertaking of an urban poverty analysis and the involvement of the BankWHO Cooperative
Program. In April 1980 the Bank first identification mission highlighted the two major issues
(financial performance and organization) which were addressed during the preparation phase.
9.           Genealy the Project was well prepared. The new water supply facilities represented
the least cost solution, resulting from the UNDP-fnced Lome water supply master plan and
feasibility study carried out by SAFEGE in accordance with the Urban Development Plan and
completed in May 1982. A PPF of US$ 441,000 was approved for the detailed engineeing and the
preparation of bidding documents for the constuction. The Bank was very active and successfl in
soliciting the interest of co-financiers (OPEC Fund, CCCE and BOAD). Appareny, the government
was conminted to the Project and to a policy of fill cost recovery, but according to the files, after
credit negoiations, 'the government was reluctant to give final approval of the project, given the
project's low estimated economic rate of return and the country's current financial problems". The
government felt that the terms of the BOAD loan were too hard, and the govenment considered
reducing the project scope and cost, and therefore the need for the BOAD loan, as well as
eiiminating free water at public standpipes. The Bank had to put some pressures on the goverment
to approve the credit documets as negotiated. In retrospect, it would have been better for the Bank
to put pressure on the government to implement the tariff increase which at one time was a condition
of board presentation (later dropped) and to have a better knowledge of the implications of
groundwater extraction by industries. It is interesting to note that the Loan Committee had two
comments on the project documenaion: first, a concern about an insufficient discussion of project
risks, particularly financial performance, and second, a recommendation that a full unde ing be
reached during negotiations on the principles of charging industries for groundwater extractions.
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
10.         Creit Effecivens and Project Start-up. The Credit was approved on May 3,
1983 and signed on June 17, 1983. The Credit became effecdve only on April 9, 1984, a delay of
almost seven months from the originally planned date, mainy because of difficulties and problems
with legal opinions and effectiveness and disburemet conditions of cofinanciers. After much
confusion and delays the contract for the supervision of works financed by CCCE was finally
awarded to SAFEGE/SEURECA; the selection of those consultants was a condition of disbursement
of the CCCE loan, which in turn was a condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit. IDA agreed to
cary out some supevion responsibilities on behalf of the OPEC Fund, and the letter of cooperaion
between the OPEC Fund and IDA was signed in June 1993. The contract with Consultas
SAFEGE/SEURECA for detailed engineering, prvparation of bidding docmnents, bid evaluation and
drafting of contracts was signed on lanuary 6, 1984.



-4-
11.          Iplemuetaidon Schedule. A comervative estimate of project completion in the
credt agreement was June 30, 1990, but most of the physical works were scheduled to be completed
by the end of 1987. Despite the delays in project star-up, including detailed design, bidding and
prequalification of contractors, the first phase works program was completed as scheduled in
November 1987, with the official inaugmtaioQ on January 13, 1988, the national day. The works
carried out under that first phase were slightly in excess of those included in the project description
in the Staff Appraisal Report: more transmission mains and distribution lines, more standpipes, less
exploration bcreholes, but 15 production boreholes (instead of 8 planned) with increased water
production of 15,000 m3/day, or 50% more than planned. The cost of that first phase was about 30%
less than the appraisal estimate, with savings for all cofinanciers of about CFAF 2.5 billion.
Although the Bank Indicated early its agreemnt in principle to the use of those savings to finance
additional works, RNET lost almost two years in preparing detailed proposals for a complementy
program which started in January 1991 and was completed by the end of 1992. The additional works
included a new production borehole and equipment for existing production bohles, 12 kn of
transmission mains, a 3000 m3 reservoir, 60 kn of distribution mains, 3 pumps to reinforce the
network and increase its densification, 3000 house connections and 20 standpipes, and vehicles and
computing equipment.
12.          The contracts for the saPation study was signed in August 1986, although the
consultants (SOGREAH) started work in October 1985; the study was completed in June 1987. The
study of the organization of the water supply and sanitation sector in Togo by SODECI was stared
in early 1987 and completed in December 1988. The study of the management and strcxre of
RNET included in the project description in the credit agreement was considered unnecsry and was
not carried out. The preparation of a follow-up water supply project was not carried out, but isead
consultants SAFEGE completed the updating of the Lom6 Water Supply Master Plan in November
1992, which was rightly considered a prerequisite to the preparation of a new project.
13.          Procurement. Although the files show that the Bantk had to insist repeatedly that
some obvious requirements for Bank-financed procurement be complied with (such as; "bidding
documem should note that bid opening will be public and indicate the place, date and dme of the
bid opening," 'any reference to national norns should be followed by: or equivalent"), RNET and
its consultants did a professional job for procurement under the project, with a few exceptions. In
the case of the institutional study, the Bank did not agree with the proposals evaluation and the
recommendation for award, and RNET decided to finance the contract with SODECI out of its own
funds. For one of the consruction contracts, RNET failed to request the performance security before
contract signing; when the contractor did not execute the contract, RNET was left with no recourse
because, by that time, the bid security had elapsed. There have been considerable delays between
contract awards and contract signing (from 6 to 9 months), with ten signatures (including the one of
the President of the Republic) required for each contract.
14.          ProJect Costs. As mentioned earlier, the original project was implemented on time
at a cost 30% less than the appraisal estimate. Additional works were financed with the unspent
baances of the IDA credit and the CCCE and OPEC loans. Regarding the IDA Credit, variations
between 1983 and 1992 in rates of exchange between SDRs and US dollars, and between US dollars
and CFA francs, in effect incsd the available financing expressed in US dollrs and CPA fancs
and actual disbursements corresponded to more dolluas and more CFA fncs than estmated at
appraisal. In the end, total project costs amounted to about CFAF 9.5 biSlion, compared to an
appraisal estimate of CFAF 9.4 billion, but for a significantly bigger program of physical works.

15.          DIsbursements and Credit Allocaon.  The cuwmlative estimated and actual
disbursements of Credit 1354-TO are given in table 2 of part I11. In the early years of the project,
disbursements have been less than esdmed at appraisal, partly because actual costs have been
substantially below appraisal project cost estimates. The allocation of dte proceeds of the IDA Credit
was amended three times and the disbursement percentages twice, to allow for the use of the savings,
taking into account the- financing also available from CCCE and the OPEC Fund. Disbuments of
the IDA credit were more than estinated at appraisal for civil works and equipment for water
production and distribution facilities, less for consulting services and PPP refiwing, and about the
same for vehicles and equipment. Although the Bank agreed to increase the disbursement percentage
to 100% of total expenditures for two categories, RNET's own resources still financed about 15%
of the project costs, in line with the appraisal estimnate. The original closing date was December 31,
1990, but the Credit was closed only on December 31, 1992 after two extensions of the closing date.
Disbursements against commitments were made until June -, 1993, and an outstandng balance of
SDR 205,000 was cancelled.
F. PROJECT RESULTS
16.          Project Objectives and Physil Results. The project was successful in meeting its
mmediae objectve of reinforcing the Lome water supply system in order to increase the number of
persons served by the system and to improve the quality of the water. Water demand has been in
line with forecasts, a very unusual situation in West Africa, and the project provided for an expansion
of facilities to help meet that demand. The physical targets of the project were exceeded. Table 3
of Part m1 shows the works that were carried out compared to the appraisal estimate, and Table 5 of
Prt m shows estimates of the population served by RNET network at the end of 1990. According
to those estimates made by RNET's consultants for the updating of the Lome Water Supply Master
Plan the increse in the population served by house connections has been in line with the appraisal
estimate, whereas the population served by standpipes was about 40% higher dtan esfimated at
appraisal. However, the popuation of Lom6 contimued to grow, and the very ambitious objective
of having 100% of the population served by RNET was not achieved; it is estimated that, at the end
of 1990, 40% of the population was obtaining its water from wells. Although no estimates were
made recently, the situation was probably not much differet by the end of 1992.
17.          FIail Performance and Iisotutioal Development. Although the financial
targets have not been achieved, the project has been successful in meeting its long-term objective of
establishing a sound basis for expanding activities on a country-wide scale and making RNET a
financially viable entity capable of generating capital for fuiture investments. However, problems
remain and achievements to date need to be consolidated.
18.          Selected indicators of RNET performance and growth and comparative income
statements of RNET for the period 1983 to 1992 are given in Annex 1 and 2, respectively, and
Anmex 3 shows the changes in water tariffs during the project period. Mainly because of
govermment's reluctance to approve tariff increases in a timely manner, RNET did not achieve the
operting ratios that were estimated at appraisal and did not comply with the 5% rate of return
covenant. In almost all the years RNET showed a slightly positive net income only because of the
accounting practice of including in non-operating revenues an amount equal to the depreciation of the
"investment subsidy" that should more appropriately be incorporated into RNET's capitol. However,
the operating income and the rate of return on (unrevalued) net fixed assets have been consistently



negative. Depreciation rates have been generaly on the high side, and the applicaion of more
reasonable rates (average of 3.5%) would correspond to a rate of return of between 0% and 1%, stil
well below the covenanted 5%. On the other hand, RNET has been in compliance with the debt
limitation covenant.
19.         In the early years of the project, it became clear that the government was not willing
to approve the tariff increases necessary to enable RNET to make a significant contribution to
investment and to service its debt on the terms and conditions specified in the Development Credit
Agreemen (interest rate of 11% and repayment in 24 years including a 4-year grace period), and in
December 1988 IDA agreed to relending terms that could be considered more appropriate for a social
sector project (interest rate of 5% and grace period of 6 years). . From the beginng of the project,
five tariff increases have been approved, but after some delays; although the rate of inflation was very
low during that period, the tarff adjustments have not bee sufficient to enable RNET to meet the
financial targets despite its efforts to control costs. The growth of revenes was also slowed by a
shift in consumption, with an increase in the share of water sales to goveent (particularly for
standpipes) which were billed at the lowest rates for pnvate consumers. The fact that people who
obtain their water from standpipes do not pay for it certainly encouraged waste and ineased
consumpion. Moreover, staring in 1988, govenment experienced difficulides in paying its water
bills, and acculated goverment arrears repr_ested about 15-month sales by the end of 1991. As
a consequence, RNET was unable to service its debt to govenment, and did not pay its suppliers and
contractors as promptly as it had done before. Some acdons were taken in 1991 and 1992 to solve
the above problems. The March 1991 tariff adjustment changed the tariff for government
consumption from the first to the second consumption bracket rate for private consms , an increase
from CFAF 140/r3 to CFAF 205/m3, or 46%. The performance cont   signed in March 1991
between goverment and RNET also addressed the problems of free water at standpipes, timely
payments of water bills by government and timely approvals of tariff incrases by government.
Finally, in November 1992, the government implemented an offsetting arrngement under which the
amounts due by RNET to government and the amounts due by govenmment to RNET cancelled each
other (although the govermment still owes CFAF 160 million to RNET).
20.          Despite the above difficulties, RNET managed to finance out of its own funds 15%
of the cost of the project and, had the govemment not been delinquent in its payment, would have
made over the last five years a contribution of about 25% to the cost of its total investment program.
These are significant achievements.
21.          The project supported RNET's efforts to strengthen its operations and management.
In 1984, RNET adopted the OCAM Accounig Master Plan and it subseqely computerized its
accounts and cost accouning and produced a manual of procedures. RNET prepares anmmal reports
on operations and financial statements and reports. Its accounts are audited regulatly. RNET's
facilities appear to be operated efficiendy, with a low percentage of unaccounted for water.
Generally, RNET has been very well managed. It also demonstrated that it is possible to have a
successful transfer of managemen and operating know-how from expatriate to national staff.
22.          The appraisal mission had identified some contadicton in the current legal statis of
RNET versus the sttsm of the Department of Hydraulics and Energy (DHE) in the Mnistry of Public
Works, Mines, Energy and Water Resources (MPW) and noted that aU investments carried out for
RNET are recorded as government subsidies. Under the project, aU urban water production, supply
and distbuon facilities were to be transferred to RNET and RNET's capital to be increased by an



-7-
amount reflecting the value of such facilities. This has not happened. On the other hand, following
the enactment in 1990 of a new law on the legal and institutional framework of public enterprises,
RNET was transformed into a state company with new bylaws in October 1991.
23.          Impact of Project. The project has had a significant impact on the quality and
coverage of water supply service to the population of Lome. Over the last ten years, water
consumption increased by about 60%, the number of connections more than doubled and the number
of people served by RNET's network increased by about 75%. During the same period, RNET's
management and operations continued to improve, and RNET is one of the best water utilities in
Africa.
0. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
24.          The project demonstrated that there is an increasing demand for good quality water
and a willingness and ability to pay on the part of private customers with house connections. Those
factors will ensure the sustainability of the project, provided that RNET is allowed to operate in a
professional manner free from politcal interference and is not denied the financial resources
necessary to operate and mntain its facilites. The recent expenence of governmen arrears and the
trend of increasing consumption of free water from standpipes are particulrly worrisome; in addition,
with the current policy of cross-subsidization, the continuous development of more expensive water
system is secondary centers might jeopardize RNET's financial viability. There is a great danger that
letting arrears build up with subsequent compensation of cross debts might become a habit, desroying
the financial discipline without which a water utility camot properly plan its development and run
its business. The development of house connections must be pursued aggressively in order to reduce
water consumpton from standpipes; also, consideration must be given to ways and means of having
people pay for water from standpipes, since there will always be a limit to what the government can
pay. All of the neighboring countries have discontinued the policy of free water from standpipes.
25.          Portunately, the performance contract between the government and RNET, signed
in March 1991, provides a useful framework to enable RNET to remain financially viable. It lists
quantified objectives for RNET, embodied in a 3-year rolling plan, dealing with the efficiency of
operations and the commercial policy of RNET. It emphasizes increasing the densification of the
network, reducing the number of standpipes and increasing the number of house connections. The
goverment's obligations under the perfomance contract are to pay its water bills in a timely manner
and to allow RNET to adjust tariffs as necessary. Compliance by both parties with their obligations
under the performance contract will contribute to the financial viability of RNET and the
suainabiity of the project.
H. BANK PERFORMANCE
26.          Through the Lom6 Water Supply Project, the Bank made a positive contribution to
the physical development of the sector and to the development of RNET. Overall, Bank performance
has been satisfactory. The Bank did a good job in working closely with goverment and RNET to
identify and begin to address the major issues in the sector and to see to it that the project be well
prepared as a prerequisite to processing of the Credit. The Bank played an important role in the
introduction of the principle that industrial users should pay for ground water extraction. It assisted



-8 -
governent and RNET in arranging cofinancing, and in effect supervised the project also on behalf
of cofimanciers. During project implementation the Bank gave proper emphasis to fiancial issues
and showed adequate flexibility in agreeing to credit agreemem amendments as and when required.
27.         In retrospect, the Bank could have been more forceful in persuading the governent
to approve tariff increases and to pay its bills promptly. Also, it would have been better to clarify
the issue of ground water extraction by industries, particularly regarding the Office Togolais des
Phosphates (OTP) at the preparation and appraisal stages. In addition, experience showed that
RNET's production suffered from competition from other users, notably agriculture, nd that there
is a need for a system for water resources management. Finally, a little more prodding by the Bank
might have avoided the delays in the preparation of the complementary program, and consequently
the need for a two-year extension of the closing date.
I. BORROWER AND BENEFICIARY PERFORMANCE
28.          The performance of govermnent and RNET has been very good for the
implementtion of the first phase program, but they did not maintain the same momentum for the
complementary works. The government should be given credit for the rather remarkble contiuity
in RNET's management (until quite recently). On its part, RNET managed to operate its facilities
very efficiently and to control costs; its performance has been outading.
29.          Regarding the payments of water bills and approval of tariff increases, the
government performance has not been very satisfactory. No action was taken on the transfer of the
ownership of water supply facilities to RNET and the corresponding increase in RNET capital. The
water resources management problem has been due, in part, to a lack of coordination between the
different ministnes involved, and the OTP issue would have been solved much earlier if the
govermment had allowed RNET to have access to the m      of ground water extaction by
OTP (as it turned out that it was much lower than estimated and from a dfferent aquifer than the one
used by RNET). The fact that RNET managed to finance out of its own funds a significant
percentage of its total investment program is a commendable achievement, but it does not justify any
complacency on the part of govemment or RNET. According to a consultant study on the future
development of the sector, the long-term marginld cost of water is estmated at CFAF 400/m3, or
almost twice the current average tariff. It is, therefore, clear that the remn   issues of adequate
cost recovery (including timely tariff adjustments and the elimination of free water from standpipes
withoutjeopardizing the supply of water to the poor), water resources management and assets transfer
would have to be addressed in connection with any fture project in the sector.
J. PROJECT RELATIONSHIP
30.          Bank relationships with government and RNET and with co-financiers on the project
has been good.



-9
K. CONSULTING SERVICES
31.          The success of the project was due in part to RNET's ability to make good use of
consulting services as well as to the kinds and qualities of consultant inputs provided under the
project. The performance of SAFEGE on detailed design, bidding and contracting, and construction
supervision has been good. The sanitation study by SOGREAH recommended an anbitious program;
it could have put more emphasis on individual sanitation and on cost recovery, affordability and
institutional aspects. The performance of SODECI on the institutional study has been satisfactory.
L. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
32.          The Staff Appraisal Report, the Development Credit Agreement and the Project
Agreement provided adequate documentation for the implementation and supervision of the project.
RNET developed a very good data base including detailed infonnation on the cost of water.
Generally, RNET submitted annual reports on operations, financial statements and audit reports in
a timely manner; it also submitted regular progress reports during the implementation of the first
phase program. The fact that updated information on certain aspects (like project costs and benefits
and financial results) was not readily available did not facilitate the preparation of this PCR.
