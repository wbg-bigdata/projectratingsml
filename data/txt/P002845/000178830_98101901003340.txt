REPUBLIC OF TOGO
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT - LONE WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Introduction
1.01     Togo has a land area of about 56,000 km2 and a population of approxi-
mately 2.6 million inhabitants. One-third of the population (about 800,000)
is urban and lives in Lome (the capital) and in 20 smaller urban centers in
the regions, where populations range between 5,000 and 30,000. Lom6 is
located on the Gulf of Guinea at the boundary with Ghana and has a population
estimated at 356,000 in 1981, equivalent to about 14% of the total population
of Togo.
1.02     The Government has been implementing water supply systems in most of
the urban centers over the last decade. In Lome, the water supply system has,
however, not kept pace with the increase in population. As a result, the
existing production and distribution facilities are inadequate and cannot
satisfy the present water demand. Water supply in rural areas is rather
precarious. An important program of village wells is being realized in order
to improve water supply in this sub-sector.
Sector Organization
1.03     The R6gie Nationale des Eaux du Togo (RNET) is presently responsible
for the operation and maintenance of urban water supply systems, e.g. in Lome
and in 17 smaller urban centers. Three other centers are still not provided
with water supply facilities. Rural water supply is the responsibility of the
Directorate of Hydraulics and Energy (DHE) in the Ministry of Public Works,
Mines, Energy and Water Resources (MPW). RNET operates under the tutelage of
MPW and under additional supervision of the State Secretariat for Industry and
State Enterprises (SISE).
1.04     RNET is also responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
Lome sewerage system which serves a very limited area of Lome and is the only
one in Togo. The implementation, operation and maintenance of public sewerage
systems in the whole country would be the responsiblity of RNET. Sanitation
other than sewerage is the responsibility of municipalities.
Water Resources
1.05     The coastal area has a tropical humid climate with two rainy seasons
(one in May-July and one in October). Lome has an average annual rainfall of
811 mm. Proceeding towards north of the country, the climate becomes drier
and the annual rainfall tends to concentrate into only one rainy season.
1.06     The smaller urban centers are supplied partly with groundwater and
partly with surface water requiring a complete and costly treatment. Most of
the rural population is supplied through traditional sources (shallow wells,



-2-
ponds, rivers) with dubious water quality and without guarantee of perennial
supply.
1.07     At present, the Lome water resource is the Continental Terminal
aquifer. Production facilities are boreholes located at Cacavelli, some 11 km
north of Lome. They produce 24,000 m3/day which is very close to the reliable
yield of this aquifer. The total capacity which theoretically could be ab-
stracted from the groundwater resources (including the Continental Terminal
aquifer) in the sedimentary coastal basin, is estimated at 170,000 m3/day.
Therefore, the water resources situation for the coastal region can be defined
as favorable and is expected to secure the water demand even in the long-
term. Boreholes will be located progressively farther away from the city and
consequently lead to increasing investment cost. The groundwater is corrosive
with a pH of 5.5 and up to 100 mg/l of free CO2.  A simple neutralization
treatment is sufficient in order to bring those parameters to acceptable
levels.
Piped Water Supply
1.08     About 43% of Lome's population is supplied with piped water, out of
which only one-third (about 53,000) are served by private connections and two-
thirds (about 100,000) by standpipes. Most of the remaining population is
supplied through traditional wells dug in the groundwater table, which is
generally polluted.
Sanitation and Drainage
1.09     A small part of the central area of Lome has a separate sewerage
system built in the late 1940s with a total of only 311 connections. There-
fore, the inhabitants essentially rely on on-site excreta disposal through
septic tanks and latrines. The sludge is periodically removed from the septic
tanks by the municipality of Lome, which, however, is not sufficiently
equipped for this service. A storm drainage system also covers only part of
the city.
Recent Investments in Water Supply
1.10     For urban water supply, the Government investment strategy over the
last decade has focussed on the smaller urban centers and has resulted in the
construction of appropriate water supply facilities in 17 centers with only
three remaining to be covered. For the period of 1976 to 1979, investment
totalled CFAF 8.7 billion (US$25.6 million) for 12 centers financing involving
both bilateral aid (FAC, KfW) and suppliers' credits.
1.11     For rural water supply, investments have been stepped up in recent
years. Programs either under implementation or under preparation to be
financed, among others, by EDF, UNDP, UNICEF, and USAID, are expected to
result by 1984 in about 1,500-1,600 new boreholes equipped with handpumps.
Even so, a recent water sector strategy paper prepared by UNDP consultants
estimates that about 2,200 additional wells would be required to meet the
demand for the then existing 1990 population. By 1990, a total of 5,500 water
points would be required for an adequate coverage.



- 3-
Recent Investments in Sanitation
1.12     For Lome, two combined interceptors discharging into the ocean both
sewage and storm water collected by the existing separate systems have been
built a few years ago: this represents the only investment in sanitation. A
recently prepared master plan for Lome sewerage and separate storm drainage
projected to the year 2000 has been presented in draft form to the Government
by TECHNO-SYNESIS consultants. These master plan's proposals are technically
too sophisticated and by far too expensive, and consequently it will be hard
to fund their implementation.
Objectives in the Water and Sanitation Sectors
1.13     The Government has fully endorsed the objectives of the International
Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade.- At the present stage of plan-
ning, priority is given to water supply. Within the Decade it should be
possible to accomplish an adequate water service level for all urban popula-
tion: for Lome with the proposed project and a follow-up project by 1987, and
for the remaining three regional centers with bilateral assistance. Also, the
rural water supply requirements of 4,000 additional water points by the end of
the Decade may be achieved if the international and bilateral efforts continue
at the present level. For sanitation, however, the financial and managerial
constraints of the country cannot cope with this sub-sector in addition to the
ambitious targets for drinking water supply. Thus, only limited action is
planned during the foreseeable future.
Bank Lending
1.14     This project would represent the Bank's first involvement in the
sector in Togo and is an excellent opportunity for establishing a mutual
understanding between the borrower and the Bank, particularly in view of
further sector development.
II. POPULATION, SERVICES AND DEMAND
Population Forecast
2.01     According to the last census of 1970, Lome had a population of
193,000 inhabitants. In 1981, the population of Lome was estimated at 356,000
inhabitants, including the population of the nearby center of Agoueve, which
will be integrated in the urban development plan. The forecast of population
utilized in the UNDP funded Lome Water Supply Master Plan of May 1982 is taken
from the recent Urban Development Master Plan of Lome, which is a comprehen-
sive document based on a socio-economic enquiry of the existing situation
(carried out in 1979) and on the analysis of projected economic urban develop-
ment. According to these forecasts, the population of the capital city will
grow to 429,000 in 1985 and 533,000 in 1990. The projected average growth
rate is about 4.5% for the period 1981-1990, while the observed average annual
growth rate was 6% for the period 1970-1979 and 4.6% between 1979 and 1981.
The annual growth rate of Togo's total population is about 2.6%. The actual



-4-
and projected decline in the population growth rate of Lome is due to the
decrease of the rural exodus towards the capital city because of the public
investments in the interior of the country in line with Government's policy to
favor the stabilization of the population in rural areas and other urban
centers.
Residential Patterns in Lome
2.02     The main features of Lome are the horizontal development, the rela-
tive absence of income strata oriented residential areas and the virtual
absence of slums. In Lome, a typical profile of a residential sector com-
prises different types of housing ranging from high standard villas over newly
constructed small apartment blocks to the traditional houses.
2.03     The continuation of present land speculation could result, in the
long run, in pushing the low income population out to the suburbs. The recent
Urban Development Master Plan, carried out by TECHNO-SYNESIS, recognized this
trend and the added costs of a low density, space intensive urban growth,
particularly in the field of urban infrastructure. Consequently, it proposed
development schemes providing for densification within the existing city
limits, and measures to preserve present habitat characteristics to prevent
the growth of urban fringe slum areas.
Existing Facilities
2.04     The present production facilities at Cacavelli consist of 12 bore-
holes in the Continental Terminal aquifer from which 24,000 m3/day are
abstracted by RNET at a depth of 30-40 m. Another 1,000 m3/day are abstracted
from the same aquifer by industries for their own purposes. The total of
25,000 m3/day represents the limit of the capacity of this aquifer. No
neutralization is provided for eliminating the water acidity. Only part of
the produced water is occasionally disinfected through chlorination.
2.05     In the immediate vicinity of the Cacavelli production installations
there is a research station which stores and tests different kinds of toxic
pesticides over an area of about 2,500 m2.  The possibility that pesticides
may contaminate the aquifer can only be avoided by moving this station to a
site which would pose no threat to groundwater. Government assurance was
obtained during negotiations that the relocation will take place not later
than by the end of 1984.
2.06     The total capacity of the four existing reservoirs is 6,700 m3 (about
28% of the present average daily production), which can be deemed as just
about sufficient for guaranteeing an adequate balancing of the demand as well
as the necessary safety margin.
2.07     The distribution network consists of about 260 km of pipes having
diameters between 60 mm. and 600 mm. About 10% of the system dates back to
the 1940s, 50% to the period 1968-1972, and 40% to 1976-1978. All connections
and standpipes are metered.



- 5 -
2.08      The technical efficiency of the system, defined as the ratio between
the volumes of distributed and produced water, is about 90%. This remarkable
rate is due to significant improvements in recent years, including the
replacement of 6 km of old transmission lines in 1980-1981 financed by FAC
with CFAF 300 million (US$0.88 million), and a leak detection campaign by RNET
with assistance from the consultants SAFEGE.
Level of Service
2.09      Lome has a low connection rate.  As of May 1981, only 7,200 domestic
connections where registered of which approximately 70% are house connections
for mainly upper income households. The remainder consists of courtyard
connections at an average rate of 3 families per household. This means that
about 52,600 persons or 15% of the total population is served by domestic
connections.
2.10     Approximately 100,000 persons or 28% of the population are served by
standpipes. Overall, 156 standpipes have been installed, of which 71 have
been shut down and do not warrant re-opening in view of their locations. The
remaining 85 standpipes are used at a ratio of about 1,200 persons per stand-
pipe. This unsatisfactory situation is mainly due to the fact that RNET
cannot fully recover its cost for standpipe operations. Consequently, only
about 43% of the population is supplied with piped water.
2.11      More than 50% of the population is still using water from traditional
wells dug in the ground water table which is heavily polluted by waste water
from septic tanks and seeping pits. This kind of well is found almost in
every household. Further, a very small portion of the population (about 3%)
depends on rain-water collection, truck supply (stored in cisterns) or on
surface resources.
2.12      Domestic piped water consumption (including standpipe consumption)
accounts for 60% of total water consumption in Lomb. The remainder is divided
among public institutions, (21.5%) commercial establishments (13.5%) and
industries (5%).
Future Water Consumption
2.13      Projections of future water consumption and required production are
given in Annex 2.1 and 2.2. The main elements are summarized in the table
hereunder.

Connection Rate                            14.8%    22.1%    27.0%
The high average per capita consumption in 1981 (228 lcd) for house
connections is due to the fact that most of the present house connections are
serving medium and high income households. Through this project the number of
persons being served by house connections will double in about 5-6 years.
Standard house connections (15 mm diameter) will be provided free of charge so
that water will be made available to many low income households with low per
capita consumptions. This phenomenon explains why the average per capita
consumption is foreseen to decrease.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01     The proposed project would be the most important action undertaken by
the Government in the urban water supply sector within the 1981-85 Development
Plan. The immediate objective of this project is to reinforce the present
Lome water supply system so that the combined existing and new facilities can
cope with the growing demand up to 1986/87. This goal will be reached through
the following actions:
(a)  Optimization of the utilization of present water supply facilities;
(b)  Implementation of new supply facilities according to the least cost
solution, resulting from the Lome Water Supply Master Plan and
Feasibility Study carried out by SAFEGE Consultants in accordance
with the Urban Development Plan (para 2.03);



(c)  Promotion of house connections, mainly through provision of free
connections;
(d)  Improvement of the institutional arrangements for urban water supply
by appointing RNET to be in charge not only of operation and main-
tenance, but also of execution and supervision of any new water
supply installations, and to achieve financial viability through
appropriate revenues.
The long-term objective of this first Bank-assisted project in this
sector is a sound basis for expanding activities on a countrywide scale,
through already tested management and institutional arrangements and technical
performances.
Project Description
3.02     This project includes the first phase waterworks as defined in the
Lom6 Water Supply Master Plan. They will largely extend the coverage of
Lom6's popuiation by the piped water supply system (table in para. 2.13) and
have been designed with due consideration of the necessary future extensions
as defined in the Lome Water Supply Master Plan. The major project components
are as follows:

3.03      The project does not include training components and only a small
technical assistance component, as other donors such as FAC, KfW, UNDP and GTZ
will continue to assist RNET in these fields. A senior staff member has been
assigned by RNET to assume training responsibilities and monitoring. By June
30, 1983, a training program will be established by RNET including an imple-
mentation schedule and the status of agreements with donors. With the
provision under the project of a management adviser, RNET's needs for
technical assistance and training will be completely covered.

summarized in the Table hereunder.

NOTE:  The project costs are net of duties and taxes
The total estimated cost of the project is US$27.6 million equivalent and
includes physical and price contingencies. The foreign exchange component has
been estimated at US$21.8 and includes both direct and indirect foreign ex-
change costs. The cost estimates are the preliminary design cost estimates
(based on end 1982 unit prices) in accordance with data contained in the Lome
Water Supply Master Plan. As the soil characteristics are well known, an
allowance of 6% for physical contingencies is considered adequate. Since the
acidity of raw water has already been identified, adequate materials for both
pump equipment and pipelines have been provided for. Price contingencies have
been evaluated based on the implementation schedule illustrated in
Annex 3.2. According to experience gathered for similar projects in West
Africa in the CFA zone, the expected price escalation would be 12% for 1983
and 1984, and 11.5% annually thereafter until the end of the implementation
period. Investments for this project would be free from import duties and
taxes.

Project Financing and Borrower
3.05     The financing plan would be as follows:
US$12.0 million           IDA (at usual terms and conditions)
US$ 3.5 million           BOAD (13 years with 4 years of grace, 11%
interest)
US$ 4.0 million           OPEC Fund (17 years with 5 years of grace,
1% commission)
US$ 4.1 million           CCCE (20 years with 4 years of grace, 5%
interest)
US$ 4.0 million           RNET
Total    US$27.6 million
A detailed financing plan for the various project components is shown in
Annex 3.3.
3.06     The CCCE would lend directly to RNET.  IDA, BOAD and the OPEC Fund
would lend to the Government. To facilitate loan administration, a single on-
lending agreement would be executed between the Government and RNET, for the
IDA, BOAD and OPEC Fund financing. An on-lending agreement providing for an
interest rate of 11% and a maturity of 24 years including four years of grace
would result in an appropriate mix of terms and conditions. Combined with the
CCCE loan at 5%, it would result in an average interest rate of about 10%,
which is close to the Bank's current lending rate. The agreement would be
denominated in CFAF and the Government would assume the foreign exchange
risk. The execution of such an on-lending agreement will be a condition of
credit effectiveness.
Project Preparation
3.07     Final design and preparation of tender documents are ready to be
started by the French consultants SAFEGE. Terms of reference were reviewed by
the Bank.  The fees are provided for under a PPF arrangement of US$441,000.
Implementation
3.08     RNET would be the implementing agency for project execution and would
be assisted by consultants. It was agreed during negotiations that a team of
consultants to supervise construction of works would be employed by the date
on which works are initiated. Works' construction is expected to begin in
late 1983 and to be substantially completed by the end of 1987. RNET itself
would carry out part of P.V.C. pipeline laying as well as the construction of
connnections and standpipes.  It has already proved its competence in this
field of activity.
Procurement
3.09 (i) The supply of equipment and material as well as the construction of
civil works, laying of pipelines, and installation of equipment would be
procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the portion of
the project to be funded by IDA, BOAD and OPEC Fund. Supply and installation
of equipment, civil works and pipelines would be procured in accordance with



- 11 -
the CCCE's guidelines for the portion of the project to be funded by them.
Eligible domestic bidders for supply and laying of PVC pipes and for civil
works would be afforded a preference of 7.5% for works and 15% for goods under
ICB procurement.
(ii) Small contracts for purchase of equipment and vehicles, estimated to
cost less than US$50,000 each, and contracts for civil works, estimated to
cost less than US$100,000 each (totalling US$0.5 million in aggregate), would
be procured on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures which were
found at appraisal to be satisfactory to the Bank for the portion of the
project to be funded by IDA, and in which foreign bidders have the opportunity
to participate. Splitting of the work's construction in contracts would be
based on sound technical principles, taking into account the procurement rules
of co-financers.
(iii) Consultants for the supervision of project works, technical
assistance, preparation of the final design and tender documents for a follow-
up project, and the various studies would be engaged in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and under terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. A total of 213 man-months of consultants at an
average unit price of US$7,650, including fees and expenses, has been provided
for.
Reporting and MIDonitoring
3.10     RNET will report regularly on the progress of project implementation
and on the implementation of its training program (para 3.03). The physical
achievements of the project will be monitored by indicators outlined in
Annex 2.1. RNET will also prepare the Project Completion Report. These
requirements will be agreed upon during negotiations.
Loan Disbursement
3.11     The character of the project would allow for a relatively fast imple-
mentation (3-4 years).  However, as this is the first project in the sector, a
conservative approach has been applied, consisting of adopting the disburse-
ment profile of the West Africa Region for the IDA credit contribution of
US$12 million. Estimated quarterly disbursements are shown in Annex 3.4. The
closing date would be December 31, 1990.
IV. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
4.01     The beneficiary of the credit would be the Regie Nationale des Eaux
du Togo (RNET), the national water authority for urban supplies. Its nucleus
was created by decree in 1959 as the Lome Water Supply Authority and then
extended to national responsibilities by law in 1964. A Statute from 1964
defining it as a legally and financially autonomous body was approved by
decree in 1965 but never fully applied. RNET's steady development was briefly
interrupted for a period of six months by a merger with the national power
company, CEET, which took place in December 1979 and was revoked in June



- 12 -
1980. The preparation of a new statute clarifying RNET's status and
reaffirming its autonomy, subject to the general rules applicable to state
enterprises, is now underway. In the meantime, the Government has agreed to
delegate to the Director General all powers necessary to assure efficient
management. Respective action, in the form of a decision by RNET's Board of
Directors, would be taken before the project becomes effective.
4.02     Until recently and contradictory to the above-mentioned Statute, RNET
was a pure operating agency for the investments implemented and recorded in
MPW-Hydraulics and Energy Directorate (DHE). For the proposed project, RNET
would, for the first time, be the executing agency for large scale investments
assisted by consultants and advised and generally supervised by DHE. After
successful implementation of the project, RNET should be capable of coping
with future sector development in terms of both investments and operation.
4.03     RNET, being responsible for operation and maintenance of the Lome
sewerage system (para 1.04), will be in charge of the feasibility study of the
Lome sanitation system which is one of the components of this project. Imple-
mentation, operation and maintenance of public sewerage systems in the whole
country can, however, only be gradually accomplished and should be considered
a long-term objective.
Organization and Management
4.04     RNET's policies are made, and its operations controlled by a super-
visory Board of Directors composed of representatives of various ministries
interested in the sector. Under the chief executive, the Director General,
four departments are responsible for Projects and Works, Operations, Admin-
istration, and Finance. Each is led by a director and split into smaller
units in accordance with their specific tasks. The organizational structure
is shown in Annex 4.1. The existing organization appears reasonable under the
present conditions. With increasing activities, however, it will be necessary
to establish a Commercial Department for customers' relations including meter
reading, billing and collection, which are now decentralized under the 18 in-
dividual operating centers. It will become mandatory to strengthen the Opera-
tions Department by splitting it into two divisions, one for Lome and one for
the other centers. Furthermore, some responsibilities should be shifted from
one department to another, like stock control from Projects and Works to
Operations or Administration. Some activities still await their establish-
ment, such as internal audit, cost accounting and systematic water quality
control. To assist RNET in its ongoing process of growth and improvement, a
management study will be carried out as part of the project. During negotia-
tions, RNET confirmed that it will afford IDA an opportunity to comment on its
further organizational development.
4.05     Most of the middle management positions were very recently filled by
young recruits of relevant education and background, but without experience
before joining RNET. Some of them have grown in their professional skills
with the authority's development. The relatively short distances in the
country facilitate regular meetings and seminars of headquarters staff with
all outstation managers at three-month intervals which ensure a close personal
liaison between the desk managers and the field staff. The dedication of the



- 13 -
Director General appears to have created a general environment of motivation
and job satisfaction.
Operations and Human Resources Development
4.06     While operations in Lome have remained stagnant for the past years,
RNET had to operate an increasing number of smaller waterworks in urban
centers throughout the country (para 1.10). This extended activity created a
need for skilled personnel which was not available in the labor market. RNET
has, therefore, sent all engineers in charge of a center and many operators to
the SODECI 1/ training center in Abidjan for courses in water supply opera-
tion, and also some of the senior staff to overseas courses (CEFIGRE).  Fund-
ing for such training has been provided by RNET itself. A shortage is now
felt particularly on the overseers' and operators' levels. RNET has largely
relied on the on-the-job training approach, but a more intensive training
program is envisaged in the form of technical assistance by foreign donors
(para 3.03). The fact that installations and offices in and outside Lome give
the impression of impeccable care and maintenance is due to the strong engage-
ment of middle and senior management to train and supervise unskilled staff.
The total number of employees is about 300 and is not expected to increase
during the project period.
Accounting
4.07     In 1981 RNET converted its Government accounting system to a commer-
cial one. All fixed assets in Lome and in the centers, although legally not
yet the authority's property, have been registered, valued and properly depre-
ciated. A cost accounting system, as part of a management information system,
is under preparation and will be introduced in 1983 with the assistance of a
consultant.
Billing and Collection
4.08     After a period of negligence, RNET has strengthened its efforts to
bill regularly, to control payments and to take appropriate actions from
reminding to disconnecting non-payers. Whereas the Government pays promptly
and in full for consumption on administration premises, it is difficult for
-RNET to collect the considerable amounts due by the local authorities for
water taken from public standpipes. Assurance was obtained during negotia-
tions that the Government will either pay or ensure the payment of these dues
as from mid 1984.
Audit
4.09     The Statute entitled the Minister of Economy and Finance to assign
one to three external auditors (Commissaire aux Comptes) for a period of three
years. Although this guaranteed some kind of external audit in the past, it
was suggested to provide in the modified Statute for the Board of Directors to
1/   SODECI is a private enterprise in charge of water supply systems in
the Ivory Coast.



- 14 -
appoint an independent external auditor, and this on a year-by-year basis. An
understanding will be sought during negotiations that an independent external
auditor, acceptable to the Bank, will be appointed effective as of FY83.
4.10     A regular internal audit unit does not yet exist.  Some internal
audit has been carried out by an outsider who, as an audit expert, is a part-
time employee of RNET. He will also assist RNET in establishing a proper
internal audit unit.
Insurance
4.11     RNET has insured only its car fleet.  It is, however, understood and
accepted that the corporation will have to insure goods supplied under the
project loan. To take over the responsibility for risks like fire, theft or
third party liability, which has so far been with the Government, RNET intends
to build up internal risk provisions for self-insurance. This solution may be
considered satisfactory and should be subject to continuous monitoring.
,V. FINANCE
Past and Present Financial Situation
5.01     For the first time in its history, RNET has established a balance
sheet for FY80/81, although its accounting system had not yet been converted
into a commercial one. The year end's statements may be considered as RNET's
opening balance. Meaningful information and reliable figures for previous
periods are extremely difficult to obtain, due not only to the application of
a Government accounting system but even more so to the temporary merger with
the power entity (para 4.01). The effort to obtain such data may outweigh
their benefit for retrospective considerations. The appraisal mission
reviewed basic data and accounting policies applied and was satisfied with the
results.
5.02     The past was characterized by RNET's activities as a distribution
entity.  A small capital of CFAF 252 million (US$741,000) was sufficient for
its few operational assets. Its working capital was mainly financed by
suppliers' credits, delayed payment of dues and bank overdrafts. The Govern-
ment financed all production and distribution systems and, after completion,
handed them over to RNET for operation. Since RNET did not have to cover
depreciation or debt service for these investments, the relatively low tariffs
were adequate to cover operating expenditures. They would have provided for a
comfortable financial cushion if billing and collection had not become subject
to relaxed attitudes causing accounts receivable to slip to 17 months equiva-
lent of billing. Sporadically, Government helped with subsidies. By and
large, RNET started its new era with retained earnings higher than its capital
but with serious lack of cash.
5.03     After its separation from the power entity and under new management,
RNET took strict measures to improve its situation supported by the Government
which approved an overdue tariff raise of 30%, effective January 1982, and
committed itself to a policy of full cost recovery in the future. Several
measures, including another tariff increase, to be implemented during the next



- 15 -
few months are expected to make water supply operations financially viable.
Moreover, the Government agreed to transfer all urban sector investments into
equity which RNET valued and provisionally accounted for as Government
investment subsidies in its balance sheet for FY80/81. As their net value is
in the order of CFAF 10 billion (US$29.4 million), it is assured that RNET's
future capital will reflect this amount.
5.04     At present, a clear improvement of the financial situation is re-
corded. Prompter billing and stricter collection, along with increased public
relations efforts, has reduced the receivables from OFAF 844 million to below
500 million. Bank overdrafts have disappeared and gradually cash accu-
mulates. Accounts payable and other liabilities, i.e. taxes and social secu-
rity contributions could be considerably reduced. The income before taxes for
FY81/82 is expected to still be negative by CFAF 93 million, compared to an
operational loss of CFAF 345 million in 80/81. Whereas last year the loss was
reduced by subsidies of CFAF 288 million to CFAF 57 million, no further
Government subsidies can be expected at present nor in the future. A new
tariff increase of again about 30% is envisaged for 1983 and from then onwards
RNET is expected to be financially viable.
Tariffs
5.05     RNET's tariff structure is simple and does not distinguish between
consumer groups. All connections are metered, and each consumer pays a basic
rate for the first 10 m3 and a moderately higher one for all exceeding con-
sumption. Tariffs in Lome and in the other urban centers are the same in
spite of the higher supply cost in the interior. The Government has decided
to maintain this system of cross-subsidization between Lom6 and the smaller
urban centers.
5.06     The Government adopted the conclusions of a tariff study, carried out
in 1982 by consultants SAFEGE, that commercial and industrial consumers should
pay considerably higher rates to keep the supply for basic needs of the popu-
lation at a reasonable and affordable level. The medium-term tariff policy
will establish a third tariff category for higher consumption and increase it
progressively over time to the extent that these consumers pay the long-term
marginal cost price. The rate structure (in CFAF/m3) might then develop as
follows, subject to adjustments as needed:
Until 1981   1982    1983    1984    1985
0-10 m3         70        90       90      100     120
This rate will also apply to the admin-
istration, including standpipe supplies.

- 16 -
Also commercial and other big consumers will benefit from the lower basic
rates, but the structure has the advantage that no categorization of consumers
will be necessary. The periodical adjustment of water tariffs according to
the above scheme would be a covenant in the loan agreement.
5.07     Public standpipe supply for the poorest section of the population
will continue. However, RNET intends to increase speedily the number of house
connections with the two-fold benefit that the comfort and quality of supply
improves for the consumers and that RNET will generate additional revenues.
It was decided to waive the fee for normal domestic connections of CFAF 75,000
(US$220) and provide them free of charge. Their cost will be recovered
through the water rates. Eligible consumers would then deposit CFAF 25,000
(US$74) for the risk of default and subsequent disconnection.
5.08     Xoreover, based on a recommendation of the tariff study, the Govern-
ment decided to introduce a tax for those industries which extract their water
directly from the groundwater table. It is justified by the fact that addi-
tional groundwater sources for the growing public demand have to be tapped in
farther distances thus causing higher marginal cost to the economy in gener-
al. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that legislative action in
this respect be taken no later than by January 1984. Any industrial utilizer
of ground water would be obligated to install a suitable meter, according to
RNET's standards. RNET's employees would be allowed to enter the premises to
read such meters. The Government will also take action to prevent any
extraction of water which would adversely affect the groundwater table.
Future Financial Performance
5.09     Financial projections for the years until 1990 are shown in Annex 5.1.
Assumptions are outlined in Annex 5.2. Salient features of RNET's finances

5.10     Pursuing tariff targets as mentioned above, RNET's income will be
sufficient to cover all operating expenses including full depreciation of
fixed assets as well as the considerable interest charge for the project
loan. The rate of return on average fixed assets will reach a level of 18% at
the end of the period under consideration. The fixed assets are shown with
historical cost since a revaluation would not be in line with national legis-
lation. However, a test calculation would result in a satisfactory rate of
return on revalued net assets of about 6% annually. To maintain this level of
revenues, agreement with RNET was obtained on a tariff policy which will
assure a rate of return of not less than 5% as of 1984 on nationally revalued
fixed asset.
5.11     A relatively high rate of return is essential for RNET's financial
performance as income is subject to a 40% corporation tax which reduces the
available surpluses considerably. The Government decision not to exempt RNET
from this income tax may be recognized as a commitment to further develop RNET
into a viable commercial entity and thus to a sound financial performance of
the sector, at least in its urban activities. Moreover, the tax income from
RNET together with the income from the onlending interest rate (para 3.06)
will help ease the burden which the Government has to bear in the form of debt
service for all former construction loans, particularly for the interior water
works, the value of which has been granted to RNET as equity.
5.12     The Funds Flow Statement demonstrates that RNET would be able to
participate in the proposed project by cash contributions of CFAF 750 million
(US$2.21 million) in addition to the works carried out by its force account,
also in the range of CFAF 750 million. This total would mean a self-financing
share of about 16% of the total project cost of CFAF 9.4 billion (US$27.6
million). In the following years, RNET could generate sufficient cash to
share the second-phase project at least in the same order of magnitude in
spite of increasing debt service. Taking into account the budgetary con-
straints of the Government in the foreseeable future, no increase in RNET's
capital has been forecast. A debt/equity ratio of 52:48 in 1990 would still
be an acceptable indebtness of the entity. Nonetheless, the usual covenant on
debt service coverage of at least 1.5 was agreed upon with RNET during
negotiations.
Financing Plan

5.14     Other investments outside Lom6 are not planned for the period of
project execution. However, the extension of water supplies in the smaller
centers may be envisaged on a short-term basis if other donors make funds
available. In the past, these works have been externally financed at 100%,
and the same financing pattern may be assumed for future bilateral assistance
so that such investments would have no impact on the above financing plan of
RNET.
VI.  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
6.01     The primary benefits of the proposed project would be improved water
supply for Lome, to meet demands through 1987, and the preparation for a
subsequent project to assure safe and sufficient supplies thereafter beyond
1990. Simultaneously, RNET, the operating agency, would be the principal
beneficiary of concerted institution building efforts by various external
donors to ensure a viable delivery system. While these benefits could not be
easily quantified, the expected increased efficiency of RNET operations (as
e.g. documented by decreasing percentages of unaccounted-for water, decrease
in arrears of customers' accounts) should provide a measure of catalytic
effects.
6.02     The urban poverty group would be an integral part of the project
beneficiaries. No clear-cut poverty areas exist in Lome, and thus, all pro-
ject related construction, in particular densification programs, would benefit
the poverty population.
6.03     The proposed sanitation study would attempt to pick up where the
sanitation master plan, recently prepared under a bilateral assistance

agreement, left off, and attempt to identify the "implementable" portion of
the plan, based on priority and affordability criteria, but also relying
heavily on appropriate technology concepts.
Least Cost Solution
6.04     The least cost solution was identified by the UNDP funded feasibility
staff of the Lome water supply system. The project investments would add to
the existing system by taking into account the optimum phasing of investment
and the availability of financial resources. Additional boreholes would
satisfy the need until 1987. Secondary and tertiary distribution networks
would be added annually to correspond to the pace of increased demand.
Investments in storage reservoirs and additional primary distribution pipes
would be deferred to the second/third phase.
Connection and Standpipe Policy
6.05     To contribute to both goals of improving substantially the standard
of living and assuring a sound financial basis for the development of the
sector, the promotion of domestic connections would be one of the principal
activities during the project execution period. There are three main con-
straints which limit growth of domestic connections under the present situa-
tion:
(i) the high proportion (55%) of rented housing, deterring tenants from
spending for housing improvements;
(ii) the low density of the distribution system; and
(iii)  the relatively high cost of domestic connections of CFAF 75,000
(US$220).
6.06     While the first constraint would not be easily addressed through the
scope of the present project, initiatives will be introduced to alleviate the
second and third ones. Concerning (ii), about 155 km of distribution pipes
would be laid to densify the network. As to the third constraint, which is
all the more serious considering that an estimated 65% of the households in
the city have monthly incomes of less than CFAF 25,000 (US$74), the project
proposes to introduce a policy of free connections for all new connections
with a diameter of 15 mm (para 5.07).  Even with this new measure, which would
also promote compound connections 1/, the connection rate is expected to
increase from the present 15% of Lom6's population to not more than 24% by
1987 and 27% by 1990.
6.07     Therefore, in addition, the already existing informal system of pri-
vate "neighborhood" vendors would continue to be of essential importance to
assure wide coverage of the urban population in Lome. This should in the

future require a more organized approach including proper regulation and
closer supervision by RNET and the Government authorities to safeguard the
acknowledged interests of both the beneficiaries and vendors. It is expected
that by 1987 close to half of the population would be served by this approach
to cover their drinking water needs. There will still be a large portion of
the population which will continue to have to rely on public standpipes. The
project will add 33 standpipes; yet with the introduction of the above mea-
sures, the percentage of the population using the standpipes is projected to
decrease from the present 30% to 28% by 1987 and to 24% by 1990.
Marginal Cost and Rate of Return
6.08     The long-run marginal cost as expressed by the Average Incremental
Cost (AIC) for the proposed investment program for Lome including the follow-
up project and third phase (to satisfy the demand until 1992) has been calcu-
lated at CFAF 250/m3. 11 (The AIC for the first phase investments represented
by the proposed project would be CFAF 220/m3).
6.09     Compared with the marginal cost, the actual average tariffs in 1981
prices are expected to grow from only CFAF 80/m3 (US$0.24) in 1982 to CFAF
180/m3 (US$.52/m3) in 1990.  The resulting Economic Rate of Return (ERR),
taking into account as a proxy of benefits the revenues associated with the
incremental water sales as a result of the project, and as costs, the capital
costs associated with the project and all incremental recurrent costs, would
be approximately 6% (Annex 6.1).
6.10     This figure understates the full benefits, as consumers' surplus as
well as positive externalities (such as improved living standards and better
sanitary conditions, which could lead to health improvements) are not cap-
tured. To obtain a truer indication of the willingness by consumers to pay
for their basic needs, one can quote the price of water presently sold via
private trucks (6 m3 for one load), which varies between CFAF 580-830/m3
(US$1.7-2.4/m3).
6.11     Whereas the proposed tariffs appear to be low in the sense of full
"economic" cost recovery, they would produce a satisfying financial outlook
for RNET (see para 5.10). While marginal cost pricing should remain the ulti-
mate objective for affordability reasons, its adaptation would be a gradual
one. During implementation of the project, the evolution of tariffs would be
closely monitored.
Affordability
6.12     With the aim of providing affordable services to as many people as
possible, a low tariff is in existence at the price of CFAF 90 (US$0.26/m3)
for the first 10 m3 per month which applies to all consumers. This social

block, which is expected to remain constant in real terms through the decade
would allow a household of 5 persons (slightly above the average size of 4.6
persons for Lome) with a monthly income of CFAF 20,000 (US$59) 1/ to consume
67 lcd., and result, within this limit, in a monthly expenditure of 4.5% of
household revenues. This presumes that the household has its own connection.
In the case of a compound connection (3 households, 14 users, 50 lcd) with a
monthly consumption of 21 m3, this would translate, with the tariffs as
projected for 1990 into monthly charges per household of around CFAF 905
(US$2.66), or 4.6% of the combined revenues.
6.13     As to the future clients of the private vendors, their monthly expen-
diture to satisfy their drinking water needs (15 lcd) is not expected to
exceed CFAF 700 (US$2) per household or 3.5% of income for a family at the
poverty level. Assuming at least constant income levels for the decade,
affordability is thus not expected to become a problem at the proposed tariff
levels. (Annex 6.2)
Population Benefitted and the Urban Poverty Group
6.14     With the implementation of the project and the follow-up phases, by
1987 additional 57,000 people are expected to have direct access to the water
supply system. An additional 24,000 would have access to standpipes, while
the remainder (225,000) of the urban population of Lome would then be served
through the "neighborhood" vendors, instead of having to rely on polluted
wells or water trucks for their drinking water.
6.15     About 55% of Lome's population is considered to be part of the pover-
ty group with monthly household incomes of less than CFAF 20,000 (US$59).
This population would be an integral part of the project beneficiaries and it
is estimated that by 1987 they would account for about 22% of total domestic
consumption. Of the portion of the project cost, about US$10 million or 36%
is urban poverty lending of funds exclusively benefitting the poor.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     During negotiations, confirmation was obtained:
(a) from the Government that:
(i)   The research station for pesticides be relocated to a
suitable location far from production installations not
later than by the end of 1984 (para 2.05);
1/   The estimated urban poverty level.



- 22 -
(ii)  It will pay or ensure payment to RNET for public standpipe
supplies on behalf of the municipalities as from July 1984
(para 4.08);
(iii) All existing facilities for urban water supply will be
transferred to RNET, their value being accounted for as
equity contribution;
(iv)  The Government will take action to prevent any extraction
of water which would adversely affect the groundwater
table, and would introduce, no later than by January 1,
1984, a levy on groundwater abstraction by industries to be
collected and retained by RNET (para 5.08).
(b) from RNET that it will:
(i)   Appoint a competent consulting firm to supervise the
implementation of project works before they begin (para
3.08).
(ii)  Prepare a training program and submit it to the Association
for review and comment not later than by June 1983 (para
3.03);
(iii) Afford IDA a reasonable opportunity to comment on its
further organizational development and staffing (para
4.04);
(iv)  Apply a tariff policy which would yield, as of 1984, a rate
of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation, of
not less than 5% (para 5.10);
(v)   Incur in no debts unless forecasts assure a coverage
of the total annual debt service at least 1.5 times its
internal cash generation (para 5.12).
Conditions of Effectiveness
7.02   (i)   Execution of an on-lending agreement between the Government and
RNET (para 3.06);
(ii)  Fulfillment of conditions precedent to effectiveness of the BOAD,
CCCE and OPEC Fund loan agreements (para 3.05);
(iii) RNET's Board of Directors' action to delegate all necessary
operational powers to the Director General (para 4.01).
Recommendation
7.03   Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would be suitable
for an IDA credit of US$12 million equivalent, to the Government of Togo at
the prevailing terms and conditions.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. Income Statement
W4ater Sales
1.      Unaccounted-for water is low in the interior centers and somewhat higher
in Lome (28%). Improved meter reading and billing procedures are expected to
reduce it, in Lome, to a maximum of 20% on a long-term basis, bringing the total
averaze to 19% and 18%.
2.      Tariffs are in line with the recommendations of the Tariff Study.  They
allow for full financial cost recovery and are sufficient for debt service and
additional cash generation.
Operating Expenses
3.      All expenditures are forecast proportionally to water salea and
are appropriately increased by expected local inflation rates.
4.      RNET has a labor force capacity for laying pipes and house  connections.
In the past, their products were sold (pipes to DHE and connections to consumers).
In the future, their works will form part of the project and thus be capitalized.
5.      The bad debt provision of 3% appears conservative taking into account that
connected consumers' payments are assured by adequate deposits. The annual
depreciation of fixed assets was calculated at an an average of 3.5% of gross
values.  This represents a weighted average of customary depreciations of RNET's
fixed assets composition.
Income
6.      Interest charges are based on 10% of the outstanding loans.
7.      At present, the income tax payable by RNET is either 1.5% of total
revenues or 40% of income, whatever is higher. The same tax rate has been applied
during the projected period.
B. Balance Sheet
Assets
8.      The increase of fixed assets assumes that all investments will be
under construction for an average of about one year.
9.      As RNET is rather overstocked at present, stocks are considered to remain
constant in volume; their values are therefore increased by inflation only.

ANNEX 5.2
Page 2 of 2
10.     Poor collection, in the past, has brought receivables to a high level
although a considerable amount had been written off in 1981. Improvements
reduced the outstanding amount in 1982 to less than CFAF 500 million, being
about 40% of total revenues. Forecasts are conservatively based on slow
reduction of this perventage over the period reaching 25% in 1987 and remaining
at this level.
Equity and Liabilities
11.     The nominal capital envisaged to be granted from the Government by
converting investment subsidies is scheduled to remain at this level
(CFAF 10,000 million) as the debt/equity ratio does not necessarily require a
further capital increase.
12.     Reserves increase moderately by the legal provision of 5% of the net
income.
13.     Customers' deposits grow more than proportionally as all consumers
benefitting from the new policy of free house connectinns will have to deposit
higher amounts (CFAF 25,000) to cover consumption for about one year and also
possible costs of dis- and reconnection.
C. Funds Flow Statement
14.     It is assumed that RNET will be able to contribute to the proposed project
CFAF 750 million (US$2.2 million) in cash and as from 1986, another CFAF 1.5
billion (US$4.4 million) to the second phase project.
15.     The application of funds for the proposed project is assumed in a
shorter time than shown in the disbursement schedule. Conservative financial
projections should take into account a possible faster implementation to assure
that, in this case, sufficient funds for own contributions and advanced debt
service be available.

TOGO - LOME FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Affordability Analysis at Proposed 1990 Tariff Levels
1.        The water consumption structure according to tariff brackets is
projected as following:
1981          1985         1990
p                    ~~~~~~~~3
O - 10 m /month       18.6%         18.9%         18.9%
10 - 30 m 3/month      23.7%         22.7%         23.6%
Over 30 m 3/month      57.8%         59.6%         57.5%
2.        The proposed tariff levels for 1990 could be structured as following
in order to produce an average tariff level of CFAF 180 (in 1981 prices):
CFAF m3 weight
0 - 10 m 3/month      90 x 0.189 ,  17.01
10 - 30 mr3/month     165 x 0.236 =  38.94
Over 30 m3/month      215 x 0.575 = 123.63
179.58
3.        With this tariff structure, the monthly charge to consumers at the
poverty level (CFAF 20,000/month) would be as following:
A)  A family of 5 - assuming the case that it has a house connection
which admittedly is very unlikely, as most of the families at the
poverty threshold would continue to be served by standpipes,
authorized neighborhood vendors, or compound connections.
A per capita consumption of 50 1/day is assumed;
B)  A compound connection serving 3 families - 14 persons at a
consumption of 50 lcd;.
C)  A family obtaining drinking water (15 lcd) from the neighborhood   3
vendor, at an assumed rate of CFAF 215 (full rate) x 1.5 -  322.5/mr
