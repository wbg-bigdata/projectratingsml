PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT - PHASE II
(LOAN 1752-TH)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the National
Agricultural Extension II Project (NAEP II) in Thailand, for which a Loan
1752-TH in the amount of US$40.0 million was approved on August 9, 1979.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1987, two years behind schedule.  The
last disbursement was made on May 23, 1988. Actual disbursement amounted
to US$34.6 million in total, representing 872 of total loan and the
undisbursed balance of US$5.4 million was cancelled.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program for the Agricultural Operations Division of Country
Department II of the Asia Regional Office, which contributed the Preface
and Evaluation Summary. The Borrower prepared a comprehensive report which
is available in OED files, but did not comment on Parts I and III which
were sent for their review and comment on February 12, 1990. The
Borrower's report was generally in agreement with the PCR prepared by the
Region, and included a detailed impact evaluation based on monitoring
surveys.
The PCR was based on a mission that visited Thailand for two weeks
in August 1989, a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (2420-TH) dated July
16, 1979, the Loan Agreement dated September 18, 1979, the Royal Thai
Government's (RTG) PCR prepared by the Department of Agricultural Extension
dated June 1989 and additional information from this directorate and
project staff, a review of the Bank's supervision reports and project
files, and interviews with World Bank staff associated with the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THAILAND
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT - PHASE II
(LOAN 1752-TH)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A.  Obiectives
1.       The objective of this second phase project was similar to the
National Agricultural Extension I project (NAEP I) which started in 1977. It
was to raise the productivity, income and living standard of the 2.3 million
farm families in the remaining 40 provinces not covered under NAEP I. This
was to be partly achieved through strengthening the organization of DOAE and
introducing the Training and Visits (T&V) System to extension services in the
project provinces.
B. Implementation Experience
2.       The project implementation period was extended by two years in total,
although most of the physical facilities and staff were already in place by
the end of June 1985--the planned project completion date. The main reasons
for these extensions were to allow RTG to construct civil works added to
supplement NAEP-I facilities, and to establish improved extension activities
in conjunction with the Rubber Replanting III project (Loan 2691-TH).
3.       Noticeable variances between planned and actual implementation were
shortfalls and delays in institutional, staff development and technical
competency. The Civil Service Commission (CSC) declined to sanction the
proposed establishment of nine Extension Regions by subdividing the existing
six regions, in view of the country's tight financial resources. For the same
reason the creation of new Regional Training Centers did not materialize,
resulting in no recruitment of the related staff and reduction in targeted
training activities. CSC also did not approve the appointment of 86
Provincial Training Officers (PTO). The Training Division established at
headquarters took a long time to become functional due to a lack of support
from CSC and the Bureau of Budgets (BOB). The project also suffered from a
lack of experienced Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) as the number of
permanent positions for these staff in each province was not adequate.
Temporary staff recruited to fill those positions were often fresh university
graduates.
4.       The lack of experienced SMSs was an important constraint in the
identification of farmer problems and the formulation of appropriate
solutions. The SMS also shouldered a heavy responsibility to provide
continuous training to district and village extension workers while they
themselves were often in need of such training. Formal linkages with research
were designed into the project but could have been further strengthened.
Ideally, a research development project should have preceded the two extension
projects in order to establish a sound technology base for transfer to
farmers. In practice, sufficient improved technology was available to address
farmer problems but was not localized.

C.  Results
S.       Overall, the project achieved much in both institutional development
and civil works planned in the SAR, and together with NAEP-I established the
T&V system of agricultural extension management with some modifications
throughout the country. The project, however, so far appears to have made
less than the expected impact on farmers acquisition of technical knowledge
and adoption of improved practices, according to the impact survey results by
DOAE's Monitoring and Evaluation (MWE) unit (see note in Part II).
6.       The SAR, following general Bank practice for agricultural extension
projects, did not undertake an economic analysis of the project. For the same
reason, an ex-post economic evaluation at the time of project completion has
not been carried out for this project.
D. Sustainability
7.       In building up an effective extension system, the project has taken a
step needed to promote intensification and production increases in
agriculture. Some progress has been made, and further progress will be
possible if the technical capability of the service is improved and when the
essentials for agricultural development (i.e. markets, incentives, inputs,
transportation, etc.) are satisfactory. The sustainability will also depend
upon clarity of goals, suitability of organization, management and provision
of budget and adequate incentives to individuals. Equally, the future success
of DOAE extension activity will depend to a great extent on how successful it
continues to be in assisting farmers and agricultural industry to raise
productivity and income.
E. Findings and Lessons Learned
8.       The project was prepared and appraised under pressure from RTG, which
resulted in a long over-lapping period with the first phase project (NAEP-I)
without benefiting much from NAEP-I experience. The project implementation'.
would have proceeded more smoothly if more thought had been given to timing of
the repeater project since it was demandlng of management staff and required a
substantial change in organization and understanding. Furthermore, it is
necessary to assess the availability of practical technology to identify and
reduce agricultural constraints at the time of project formulation. It is
also necessary to discuss in detail the proposed institutional changes (for
example research-extension linkages, sanctioning of additional staff and
organization) with all concerned agencies such as CSC at appraisal stage.
Lastly, sufficient provision should be made for maintenance of the project-
built facilities, and operating and replacement costs for vehicles after the
project completion.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.       Project Identity
Project Name:    National Agricultural Extension II Project
Loan No.:        1752-TH
R V P unit:      Asia Region
Country:         Thailand
Sector:          Agriculture
Subsector:       Agricultural Support Services
2.       Background
2.1      The NAEP II project was a direct extension of the NAEP I (Loan
1393-TH), implemented during 1977-84, following a pilot extension program
under the Bank-assisted North East Rural Development Project (Loan 1198-TH).
Together these three projects were to establish the nationwide T&V system of
extension qervices in Thailand.
2.2      In the mid 1970s, RTG had been concerned with the effectiveness of
extension services in transmitting known technology to farmers and recognized
the need for more efficient extension services. This led to an initiation of
the pilot extension program under Loan 1198-TH, for testing the T&V System of
extension services, in four selected North-East provinces. Following the good
start-up of the pilot program, the NAEP I was quickly formulated by RTG and
appraised by the Bank (1976), partly reflecting strong pressure from
Provincial Governors to extend the program rapidly throughout Thailand. The
NAEP-I covered 33 provinces including the four pilot provinces, out of
Thailand's 73 provinces. The project assistance included financing for
additional staff, training centers, houses for Extension Agents (EAs),
vehicles and equipment, staff training, fellowships, and consultants to assist
DOAE with project implementation.
2.3      In 1978, when the NAEP I was in its seconi year of implementation,
RTG requested the Bank's assistance in financing a second phase project
(NAEP II) to cover the remaining 39 provinces 1/ so that more farm families
would benefit quickly from the improved extension services. As in the case of
NAEP I, there was also strong political pressure from provinces not covered
under NAEP I. In response to RTG's request, the Bank appraised the NAEP II in
September 1978.
1/ During the project implementation period, one of 39 provinces was
subdivided into two. Subsequently, NAEP II covered 40 provinces in
total.



-2-
3.       Project Objectives and Description
3.1      The major objective of the project, was to raise the productivity
income and living standard of the 2.3 million farm families in the 39
provinces not covered under NAEP I. This was to be partly achieved through
strengthening the organization of DOAE and introducing the T&V System of
extension services in the project provinces.
3.2      The project, which overlapped with NAEP I (closed in July 1984), was
to provide for:
(a) further strengthening of the DOAE's headquarters' organization and
the establishment of clear lines of command and coordination from the
national level to the districts, including the establishment of nine
Extension Regions;
(b) the introduction of sound extension methodology based on the T&V
system of extension;
(c) substantial increases in staff, training, accommodation facilities,
vehicles and equipment;
(d) the employment of agricultural and engineering consultants; and
(e) project monitoring and evaluation.
3.3      The project, phased over a five and half year period, was estimated
to cost US$70 million, of which two major components were civil works and
vehicles and equipment, accounting for about 65% of total. Against this, an
IBRD Loan of US$40 million was negotiated in June 1979. The loan agreement
was signed in September 1979 and became effective on December 18, 1979. The
project implementation was completed on June 30, 1987, and the loan was closed
on December 31, 1987, after two years' extension.
4.       Proiect Design and Organization
4.1      The Phase I project (Loan 1393-TH) laid a clear conceptual foundation
for the project, which was shared and understood by both the Bank and RTG.
The project, being the straight-forward scaling up of NAEP I by geographical
coverage, contained no particular innovative aspects in its design except
further institutional developments in the DOAE organization, in addition to
what was provided for under the NAEP I. These were the establishment of a
Training Division at headquarters, and nine agricultural extension regions in
order to increase the organizational effectiveness in carrying out the
expanded nationwide reform of agricultural extension services.
4.2      The project preparation (1978) by DOAE with the assistance of the
consultant engaged under NAEP I was considered generally satisfactory, meeting
the appraisal requirements. The scope and scale of the project proposed by
RTG was also considered appropriate by the Bank appraisal mission after
examining DOAE's implementation capacities and manpower availability in view
of the overlapping implementation with NAEP I. In retrospect, both DOAE and
the Bank under estimated the importance of assessing the availability of



-3-
technical messages to solve farmers' problems in designing the project (see
para. 5.8). The treatment accorded research in NAEP II was scanty compared
with other T&V Extension Projects in the Region. No direct findings or
linkage with research institutions was provided under NAEP II, though this was
strengthened later through the National Agricultural Research Projert (Loan
1922-TH). In addition, it appears that the appraisal mission did not fully
discuss the proposed DOAE institutional development, though the SAR indicates
that an assurance on this was obtained from CSC (see para. 8.4, item iv).
5.       Project Implementation
5.1      Critical variances between planned and actual project implementation
need to be reviewed in relation tot (i) implementation period;
(ii) institutional and staff development; (iii) modification of the T&V
system; (iv) availability of extension messages; and (v) project costs and
IBRD loan allocation.
5.2      Implementation Period.  The planned implementation period was 5-1/2
years starting from the actual loan effective date of December 1979 to the SAR
expected project completion date of June 1985. Most of the construction of
physical facilities, DOAE's reorganization and staffing actually achieved
under the project were already in place by the end of June 1985; the project
period was extended two years in total, one year each in 1985 and 1986. The
reason for the first extension was to allow the upgrading of the five existing
Regional Training Centers 2/ by additional civil works to supplement NAEP I
facilities.  The second extension was to permit more time to establish
improved extension activities in conjunction with the Rubber Replanting III
Project (Loan 2691-TH).
5.3      The Bank concurred with RTG's request for these extensions in view of
substantial savings estimated in the loan account (US$7 million as of August
1985), resulting from two devaluations of the Baht since 1980 and RTG's
decision to finance all costs of field demonstration (US$2.2 million) from
local funds. The project, however, did not fully achieve the targets of civil
works and institutional development set out for it, for the reasons explained
in the following paras. 5.4 and 5.5. The Bank's Project Performance Audit
Report (PPAR) for NAEP I dated June 1986 noted that the implementation period
of six years for the similar agricultural extension project was not long
enough. In case of NAEP II, however, as far as the DOAE reorganization and
conetruction of physical facilities is concerned six years would have been
enough.  A point to be noted is that due to the country's tight financial
resources, coupled with a long overlapping with NAEP I, the Civil Service
Commission (CSC) declined to approve some of the proposed staffing and
reorganization.
2/ The term 'Regional Training Centers' used in the SAR, Loan Agreement
and 1985 Amendment to Loan Agreement is confusing because almost no
training facilities or accommodation were built (see Annex 1). In
order to maintain consistency with these documents, the PCR also uses
this term, unless otherwise mentioned.



- 4 -
5.4      Institutional and Staff Development.  Thin was the most problematic
component to implement for DOAE. CSC did not approve the establishment of six
new Extension Regions by subdividing three existing larger regions. Their
grounds for this decision was that it was Letter for DOAE to seek additional
staff, vehicles and equipment to strengthen the existing three regional
offices. For the same reason, one of the two Regional Agricultural Extension
Training Centers planned in the SAR was not built. None of the Regional
Offices in both NAEP I and NAEP TI Regions is currently equipped with training
facilities and DOAE is facing difficulties in finding suitable facilities for
their Regional level training program. However, DOAE is currently seeking a
bilateral financial assistance to construct six regional training facilities.
The project also suffered from lack of approval from CSC to make the project
established Training Division at headquarters fully functional until mid-1985.
The exclusion of much of the institutional development in training, therefore,
appears to have affected the quality of training activities under the project,
(see para. 5.7) though the number of training programs conducted was
impressive as reported in DOAE's PCR.
5.5      With regard to the recruitment of incremental staff, additional staff
for the Regional Offices including Centers were not appointed as a result of
non-approval of the establishment of new Regional Offices. Of a total of 15
senior management and supervisory posts to be filled at DOAE headquarters,
only two management posts for the Training Division were sanctioned by CSC.
At provincial level, the plan called for 78 provincial training officers and
assistants, but none of these posts was sanctioned by CSC. Appointment of
Subject Matter Specialists (SHS) exceeded the SAR target by about 302.
However, the shortage of experienced SMS was often noted by the Bank
supervision missions. In addition, SMS were frequently assigned
administrative responsibilities which interfered with their essential
technical duties. These shortcomings of absence of training staff and
experienced full-time SMS were detrimental for effective operation of the T&V
system introduced under the project. Furthermore, the PCR mission noticed in
its field visit that sub-district Extension Agents (EA) currently spend over
50  of their time for M&E data collection as well as non-DOAE work (rural
development activities).
5.6      Modification of T&V System.  There were some modifications in the T&V
system originally established in DOAE. In 1983, DOAE modified the role of
Contact Farmers (COF) as a main information source to farmers in the T&V
system.  Originally, the system assumed that the majority of farmers would
acquire their technical information through COF. DOAE, however, found that it
was not practical to expect COF to disseminate all the information under Thai
rural conditions. Subsequently, the farmer group leader (COF is not the group
leader in many cases) and progressive farmers among farmer group with special
interest in a certain crop, were made to have direct contact with the EA in
addition to the COF. This modification was, according to DOAE, formally



-5-
instituted in both NAEP I and NAEP II in 1983 but had not been communicated to
the Bank officially.31
5.7      'Fortnightly Training* for EA's has been changed since 1986 to once a
month with SMS and once a month with District Extension Officer (DEO).  The
Bank's supervision mission of February 1986 commented on this changet  "In the
*       mission's opinion in part because the technical information and skills taught
at workshops and fortnightly training sessions were in many cases not of local
importance (failed to target the farmer's problems), extension workers (EA)
complained that training was boring and not worthwhile.  The present response
to this technical deficiency has been to reduce the "training program".
5.8      Availas'ility of Extension Messages.  The project faced great
difficulty in identifying the farmer's problems and formulating messages to
solve these problems. It may be noted that the project was formulated and
appraised on the apparently optimistic assumption that there were already
appropriate technical messages existing to solve the farmer's problems. The
Bank's supervision mission in April 1987 noted in its Aide Memoire: "In the
field the mission observed that farmers have difficulty in adopting technical
messages formulated on the basis of DOA research findings. DOA
recommendations are often high cost technologies geared to yield-maximization
rather than profit-optimization".
5.9      Proiect Costs and Allocation of Loan.  As detailed in Part III, the
final project cost was B 1,719.5 million (US$71.j million) compared with the
appraisal estimates of B. 1,400 million (US$70 million). The increase in
total project cost of 232 in Baht terms was due partly to the increases in the
project scope and the overseas training and consultant requirements, and
partly the prolonged implementation. However, the increase in project cost in
US$ terms was marginal at 22, due to the devaluation of the Baht by 20Z over
the project implementation period. For the reasons given above the original
loan allocations were revised in September 1985 and October 1986 to reflect
changes in financing for civil works, training and consultants.
6.       Project Results
6.1      The project achieved much both in the spheres of civil works and
*       institutional development planned in the SAR.  Together with NAEP I, it
established the T&V system of agricultural extension services throughout the
country. There were some delays and shortfalls in meeting the SAR targets,
*    .   particularly in establishing the Training Division at headquarters and
training facilities at regional level. Actual achievements of the major
*       project components including civil works, vehicles, equipment, staffing,
overseas training and consulting services are detailed in Part III and
Annex I.
3/ There is a rather important contradiction regarding the role of COF in
DOAE's PCR (see second para. of page 82, Chapter 8 - Evaluation of the
Impact of NAEP). Discussion with the DOAE staff member who was in
charge of drafting this chapter reveals that a consultant who assisted
in preparing this chapter did not describe the situation correctly.



- 6-
6.2      The project impact was not measured directly in terms of changes in
cropping patterns, use of inputs or yields. The DOAE's M&E unit, however, has
used information from annual household surveys for 37 sampled provinces
covering both HAEP I and II areas to measure factors associated with
increasing crop yields. These included, for example, the extent of technical
knowledge acquired and selected recommended-practices adopted by farmers over
a period of time with paddy, maize and rubber. The analytical results are
summarized under item 6 of Project Results in Part III. Apart from paddy no
separate analysis for NAEP II alone was conducted. It should be noted that it
is too early to make an explicit assessment at this stage for NAEP II because
most of the improvements carried out under the project have been in place
barely for the last 2-3 years. It is also misleading to compare the results
between NAEP I and NAEP II provinces as their land use patterns differ
significantly.
6.3      The results covering both project areas indicate an increase of 7 to 10
percentage points in knowledge acquisition for the crops and 2 to 15 percentage
points for adoption of practices between the pre-project and 1986 surveys.
These increases, however, were considered less than expected according to the
M&E unit. Comparison among paddy and maize farmers who were members of groups
who attended demonstrations and received direct visits from the EA indicates a
significant trend towards better knowledge and tire adoption of more practices
with increasing extension contacts. The results also showed that there was
measurable impact on crop diversification and intensity. The number of crops
grown by farmers increased from 1.6-2.1 crops per year in the pre-project year
to almost 3.0 in 1986, for the provinces where the project Implementation took
placer earlier (mostly under NAEP I). However, there was a minor decrease in
the provinces where project activities started later (NASP II provinces).
Increase in cropping intensity, though marginal, was also observed in the early
project implementation provinces and a minor decrease in the late project
implementation provinces.
6.4      As for economic benefits deriving from the project, the SAR,
following general Bank practice for agricultural extension projects, did not
undertake an economic analysis. This is on the grounds that any attempt to
quantify benefits from agricultural extension to the agricultural sector can
only be speculative, given the difficulty in isolating the net influence of
agricultural extension from the many other exogeneous factors influencing
agricultural benefits. For the same reason, an ex-post ecoromic evaluation at
project completion has not been undertaken.
7.       Proiect Sustainability
7.1      Under the project. the DOAE's organization has been strengthened and
the T&V system of extension services has been established to provide extension
services to project farmers. Together with NAEP I, the DOAE now has in place
the field staff and extension infrastructure throughout the country, for an
agricultural extension service capable of assisting farmers to make
agriculture more efficient and to improve farm income, although there is a
serious shortage of training officers and experienced SMS at all levels.
Whilst a beginning has been made, the sustainability of the project will
depend partly on the DOAE being able to retain good staff, as well as to
upgrade its staff capabilities through the implementation of a well-defined
training program. Equally, the future success of the DOAE extension activity



- 7-
will depend to a great extent on how successful it continues to be in
assisting farmers to raise productivity, income and standard of living.
7.2      The DOAE extension agents have been recognized by political leaders
and other government agencies as providing an effective communication channel
to rural residents. Herein lies a problem when non-extension responsibilities
(rural development activities), are added to the regularly designated duties
of problem identification, solving and farmer education. More accountability
to the local farmer could serve to strengthen the sustainability of extension
services.  With strong leadership of the DOAE senior management the system
could continue to improve. However, pressure to undertake new activities or
directions may prevent full utilization of the present capabilities.
7.3      At the time of the PCR mission's visit, the DOAE was facing a
considerable shortage of funds for the regular maintenance of the facilities
constructed under the project, in particular staff houses, operating cost of
the project vehicles, and timely provision of replacement cost of the
vehicles. It is essential to have these funds adequately made available to
continue the operation of the new extension mechanism introduced under the
project.
8.       Bank Performance
8.1      The performance of the Bank in project identification through
appraisal was generally satisfactory in spite of the fact that the project was
processed in considerable haste (see "Use of Bank resources" of Part III,
reflecting the borrower's preoccupation with strong political pressure from
non-NAEP I provinces. The Bank provided adequate resources to meet the
objectives and targets for project processing. In retrospect, it might have
been better if the appraisal mission had paid more attention tos
(i) assessing the availability of technical messages (see para. 5.8); (ii) the
timing of the second phase project (see para. 5.3); (iii) assessing the
availability of suitable sites for provincial and district extension offices;
(iv) estimating the office space according to the size of the farming
population of districts and provinces instead of building the same standard
type office building throughout the project provinces; and (v) the borrower's
procedures for counterpart funding in the civil works construction.
8.2      The Bank's supervisory effort was reasonably satisfactory.  A total
of 15 supervision missions were fielded in the 8-1/2 years' period including a
duration of 1-1/2 years covering period before the loan became effective and
after the project completion. Relatively good continuity of staff was
maintained between missions. In addition, there was the useful input of a
Bank M&E specialist and the project Task Manager who visited the project
several times, independent of the regular supervision missions, in connection
with supervision of other projects. A point of criticism is that the Bank
never sent a civil engineer or architect either at appraisal or during the
7-1/2 years of project execution despite the fact that 60? of the loan amount
was allocated to civil works; fortunately the supervision by the local
consulting engineers was ent3rely adequate and the funds in the result were
applied.



8.3      It may be noted that the supervision missions adopted a rather
flexible attitude towards the enforcement of the covenants with respect to the
establishment of nine Extension Regions and Regional Training Centers, and the
recruitment of their related staff as well as some of the senior staff at
headquarters. There was also good liaison with the DOAE, by the Bank's
resident mission.
8.4      From the Bank's point of view, the lessons which can be learned
include the following:
(i)  in designing any repeater project, which is demanding of
management staff and requires a substantial change in
organization and understanding, it is advantageous to avoid a
long overlapping period with the first phase project. The
NAEP II was implemented without learning much from the NAEP I
experience (see para. 9.2). The Project Performance Audit
Memorandum (PPAM) of the NAEP I draws attention to this same
point.
(ii) The need to identify clearly the farmers' problems and assess
the availability of technology to solve their problems at the
project formulation stage (see para. 5.8).
(iii) While the Bank did well in agreeing to the re-appointment of the
Phase I engineering consultants, at appraisal more attention to
the borrower's procedures for counterpart funding would have
been an advantage. Building areas had to be reduced to bring
costs within the level of available counterpart funding even
though Bank financing was adequate.
(iv) The need to discuss fully the proposed institutional changes
with the CSC. At negotiation, RTG delegations advised the Bank
that they had been instructed not to commit RTG reorganization
and staffing before the CSC had an opportunity to review the
proposals in detail.
(v) The need to ensure provision for sufficient maintenance costs of
the project-built facilities, operating costs for the project
procured vehicles and replacement funds for the vehicles (see
para. 7.3).
9.       Borrower Performance
9.1      While there were some weaknesses, as highlighted earlier, the overall
performance of DOAE in implementing the project has been generally
satisfactory. During the project formulation, DOAE performed well with a
strong commitment of the RTG to the project for the reasons explained in
para. 2.3. It however, appears that their commitment was somewhat eroded by
the completion of NAEP I as indicated by CSC disapproval of some institutional
development proposals. Also enthusiasm for the project diminished and
attention was directed to more target oriented activities, such as campaigns
(e.g. crop diversification), and greater demands were placed on DOAE to
perform non-extension activities.



-9-
9.2      Throughout the implementation period, most of the Bank's supervision
missions rated the project performance as "moderate problems" and listed
*managerial" problems in first place, as shown in Part III. In retrospect,
this managerial problem is due in part to work overload of the DOAE management
as a result of a long overlap period of NAEP I and NAEP II and in part to lack
of support from CSC and BOB.
9.3      From RTG's point of view, the following major lessons can be learned
from the experience gained in implementing the project. Some are common to
the lessons learned from the Bank's point of view (see para. 8.4).
(i) DOAE's experience with NAEP II clearly highlights the need to
proceed with caution, and not to under-estimate the importance
of gaining experience from the first phase project before
launching the second phase.
(ii) The importance of a careful review of the proposed institutional
development initiatives with all concerned agencies (such as
CSC) should not be under-estimated. It should be given adequate
attention at an early stage of the project cycle (see para. 8.4,
item (iv)).
(iii) The need to provide sufficient price contingency for counterpart
funding in the civil works. Insufficient provision for Baht
inflation caused building sizes to be trimmed to keep to the
forecast expenditure. Building for training, is as a result
less than foreseen as necessary in the SAR (see Annex 1).
10.      Project Relationships
10.1     Bank staff during supervision of this and other projects (Land Reform
Areas, National Agricultural Research, National Rural Development, various
irrige'.ion projects, etc.) looked for evidence of and tried to improve
relationships between agencies and activities. DOAE representatives were
invited to travel with the missions and to attend local and wrap-up meetings.
The project implementation benefited considerably from this effort; in
particular the linkage between DOA and DOAE is noticeable in mutual
understanding.  There are however still unutilized opportunities among RTG
staff for joint activities to improve technical and program linkages. In
particular, field problem identification, verification trials and
demonstration activities could be improved by more contacts and sharing of
responsibilities with research organizations. From time to time DOAE took
advantage of training opportunities offered by other agencies--but much more
could have been done especially to strengthen training provided to SMS.
10.2     Bank and DOAE relationships with other relevant parties including
consultants providing advisory services to the project and contractors for the
civil works have been satisfactory. It appears that more frequent direct
dialogue between the Bank and the CSC might have improved the project
implementation. There are no written records in the Bank project file
indicating that the supervision missions held discussions with CSC regarding
DOAE's difficulty to obtain CSC's approval for additional staff and
reorganization of DOAE.



- 10 -
11.      Consulting Services
11.1     General satisfaction over performance of the consultants and the
contractors employed under the project was expressed by DOAE. Extension
advisory services as contracted under NAEP I were continued to provide
guidance on methodology, monitoring and evaluation and to assist with the
preparation of the PCR. The long-term involvement of a contractual firm and
individuals was helpful in establishing the T&V approach. However, as time
progressed few new approaches were presented. Short-term consultants were
also employed to provide particular technical advice. The same local
consultancy firm which had served for NAEP I was employed to design and
supervise the construction of the Civil Works. Their performance was
generally satisfactory particularly in the execution phase where their
experience of Bank procurement procedures was an advantage. Some of the
building designs will require a higher recurrent expenditure on maintenance
than need have been the case. Annex 1 gives more detail of the civil works
part of the project.
12.      Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1     The SAR and Loan Agreement generally provided an adequate framework
for project implementation. Some minor modifications were agreed between the
borrower and the Bank.
12.2     The supervision reports and other relevant project documents
available at the Bank contained generally sufficient information for
preparation of the PCR. However, some data required to complete Part III
tables were neither readily available nor properly recorded throughout the
project cycle. These includet (i) planned and revised project timetable,
(ii) cost of the Bank staff input; and (iii) actual total project cost. In
addition, the PCR mission noted that the descriptions of staff housing in the
SAR and in the Loan Agreement were not consistent. This led to ambiguity in
interpretation of the type of housing to be built (see Annex 1). The
borrower's PCR finalized by DOAE in June 1989 was a useful reference.

PART II - PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
The Borrower did not specifically comment on Parts I and III of
this PCR. The Borrower did, however, prepare a comprehensive completion
report with a substantial amount of analysis of the impact evaluation
results. These results were based on monitoring surveys of farmers in
areas subject to Phase I and to Phase II of NAEP and will be very useful
should an OED audit be undertaken.  The full report of the Borrower is
maintained in OED files.

exchange rates (Bank of Thailand).
Comments
Total cost overrun was 23Z in Baht terms, however in US dollar terms
it is marginal (2Z) compared with SAR estimates, reflecting the depreciation
of the Baht against the US dollar during the project implementation period.
Cost overrun (in Baht terms) was caused partly by the significant increases in
project scope (additional buildings for NAEP I and the development of
extension services under the Third Rubber Replanting Project) and in the
consultant inputs and average training requirements and partly by the
prolonged implementation period resulting in the increased salaries and
operating costs. Cost overrun would have been higher 'f the costs of
additional motorcycles (1414) and the salaries and operating costs in FY86-87
were included in the project costs.

6.       Prolect Results
A. Direct Benefits
No direct benefits were quantified in the SAR. as in the practice for
agricultural extension projects. The project M&3 unit, however conducted
surveys to assess the extent of tecbnical knowledge acquired and practiced by
farmers, and crop diversification and cropping intensity (see para. 6.2 and
6.3 of Part 1). The following tables summarize the results of M&E evaluations
