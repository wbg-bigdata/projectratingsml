INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Trinidad and Tobago for the equivalent of $9.3 million to help
finance an education project. The loan would have a term of 22 years,
including a seven-year grace period with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Recent Developments and Prospects
2.        The latest Economic Report (WH-192a) was distributed on Septem-
ber 3, 1969 and an updating economic memorandum (CA-10) on May 13, 1971.
A basic economic mission which visited the country last April/May is
preparing a report which will pay special attention to the unemployment
problem and is expected to be distributed to the Executive Directors by the
end of the year. A country data sheet is attached as Annex II.
3.        Thanks to- its petroleum resources, the economr of Trinidad has
achieved a high GNP per head of about $900 in 1971. Petroleum production
and refining - which account for about one-fifth of GNP, two-thirds of
merchandise exports and close to one-third of central government revenue -
have been the main determinant of growth and employment. While petroleum
production rose rapidly in the 1950's, and helped to stimulate the expansion
of GNP, this trend shifted in the 1960's, especially towards the end of the
decade. The exhaustion of traditional producing areas brought down petroleum
production from 60 million barrels in 1967 to 47 million in 1971. As a
result, GNP rose slowly and for the decade as a whole achieved an annual
average increase of only 3.9 percent or about 2 percent per capita. There
were, of course, other stimuli to growth outside the petroleum sector. The
rapid increase in exports to the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA)
is a case in point, but by 1971 these exports amounted to only 10 percent of
total merchandise exports and manufactures sold to CARIFTA were still only
about 9 percent of total Trinidadian industrial output. Another source of
expansion was public expenditure, which rose rapidly after the disturbances
of 1970, despite the slow growth of current revenue. Nevertheless, it is
unlikely that the stimulus provided by the public sector can be sustained at
the same extraordinary pace in the foreseeable future; moreover, despite its



-2-
sharp increase in 1970 and 1971, public capital formation is still only
about one-quarter of that in the private sector, which thus has to be
relied upon as the main promoter of future economic expansion.
4.         The slow growth of output and the increase in population, which
averaged 3 percent in the first half of the decade and then declined sharply
as a result of a lower natural growth rate and because of emigration,
combined to create an increasingly evident unemployment problem. While the
open unemployment rate of 13 percent of the labor force is not unusual by
developing country standards, it is more striking perhaps in a country with
the per capita income of Trinidad.  Moreovek) the average per capita -i-ncbme
does not adequately reflect the high aspiratibns crea'd in the b0il of 'the
labor force by the high wages in the petroleum sector. This si'tuation
probably contributed to the serious disturbances which occurred 'in the spring
of 1970. The unemployment problem has thus become the major con'cern of the
Govenument. In this context, the economic mission which the Bank sent to
Trinidad in May 1972, concentrated on the analy'sis of the unemployment problem
and on possible remedies. The mission's major findings a're described
below:
5.,       The unemployment problem has social and economic root's which a're
shared in varying degrees by other developing countries, especially those
in the Caribbean area. Among these features are:
a. The high level of productivity in the petioleum and related
industries, measured in terms of value-added per person
employed, has tended to pull up wage levele throughout the
economyr, making most other industries and most branches of
agriculture unprofitable in competition with the rest of the
world, while still leaving abnormally large dispafities
between high-paid and low-paid occupations in Trihidad; these
features are common to a number of Caribbean economies which
depend heavily upon petroleum and mineral enclaves;
b. The availability of impo'rts of relatively dheap dapital equip-
ment, coupled with high money wages, has  tended to encourage
capital-intensive production techniques in manuifacturing and
construction - a tendency reinforced by some 6f the incentives
given for industrial investment (e.g. interet subsidies,
accelerated depreciation allowances, tax rebates on ipoirted
equipment);
c. An acute shortage of entrepreneurial, managerial and technical
skills, aggravated by emigration of trained and enterprising
people to North America and elsewhere, operates as a
severe constraint on job creation in both public and private
sedtors;
d. As a result of an academically-oriented education systeij



-3-
poorly adapted to the requirements of the country's
economy, a high proportion of young people in their early
teens leave school without the training or the instruction
that would fit them for jobs in industry or agriculture;
e.  The small size of the local market - even if it is expanded
to include the CARIFTA market - in the absence of compensating
factors such as low wages or special skills, inhibits the
development of manufacturing industry and reinforces the
country's propensity to import a high proportion of the goods
used for consumption and investment; and
f. The relative stagnation of non-petroleum private investment;
apart from the adverse effect of the sluggish growth in the
petroleum industry, private investors, especially foreign
investors, have tended to react unfavorably to the government
program of selective acquisition or significant equity partic-
ipation in 19 private firms - including the major sugar producer -
even though satisfactory compensation was arranged in all cases.
6.        Unemployment affects mostly the young and the uneducated.  In 1970,
61 percent of the unemployed were between the ages of 15 and 24h in turn,
25 percent of that age group was unemployed. Moreover, 40 percent of the
unemployed have been out of work for more than six months or have never worked.
Another serious aspect of unemployment and of the slow rate of economic growth
has been the resulting large emigration. While emigration has in statistical
terms contributed to reducing the labor force and thus to keep the rate of
unemployment from rising - it has stayed at the same level since 1967 - many
of the emigrants have been skilled workers and professionals. About 12,500
Trinidadians annually emigrated to the U.S. and Canada in 1970 and 1971, the
peak emigration years; about one-third of the emigrants were skilled production
workers and professionals. The departure of middle and higher professional
and management talent is a major constraint to economic development.
7.        At the present time, Trinidad and Tobago faces a new opportunity
to overcome the structural constraints besetting its economW - especially a
continuing high rate of unemployment - due to the prospective revival of the
petroleum and affiliated industries. 'New oil finds by AMOCO - a subsidiary
of Standard Oil of Indiana - are likely to raise output by more than one-third
in the next four years to about 65 million barrels annually.  At the same time,
depending upon the granting of the necessary import licenses for liquid natural
gas by the U.S. Federal Power Commission and the speed with which the necessary
investments can be organized, the recently discovered large natural gas fields
off the east-coast of Trinidad will generate an additional source of foreign
exchange earnings by the mid to late 1970's. If all goes well, exports of
goods and non-factor services net of oil imports could rise from about TT$611
million in 1971 to TT$950 million in 1978. Similarly, government revenues
from the expanded petroleum industry are expected to rise from TT$70 to TT$200
million over the same period. The availability of foreign exchange and fiscal
resources is thus not likely to be a major constraint to development in the



-4-
foreseeable future. Nevertheless, unless the additional resources are
used to correct some of the structural deficiencies of the econony, Trinidad
and Tobago is likely to continue facing similar problems in the future.
8.        The main areas of possible corrective action concern public
development expenditure - and within which human resources have high priority -
and policies regarding prices and incentives for the growth of non-petroleum
production. As regard development expenditure, perhaps the major constraint
which Trinidad faces is the limited capacity of the public sector to plan
and implement viable programs. A substantial infusion of technical assistance
is necessary. What form this assistance might take will be the subject of
discussions with the authorities based on the forthcoming economic report.
As for priorities within development expenditure, education and housing
deserve special mention. The educational system has traditionally been
organized to produce a highly educated elite, but providing few facilities
and unsuitable programs for the training of the bulk of the labor force.
9.        Trinidad and Tobago is reasonably well endowed with basic infra-
structure, although there remain ongoing needs for public utilities and there
is an unmet demand for certain port facilities and roads. The area where
public outlays can perhaps make the greatest contribution in terms of employ-
ment generation and indirect benefits for the rest of the economy is that of
housing construction. There is a large backlog of housing needs, and with
rising incomes in the next few years, there is likely to be a substantial
new demand for housing, even from lower income groups. Housing construction
is heavily dependent on unskilled manual labor, and can be made even more
labor-using in the case of public projects through changes in bidding
procedures which favor bids with a high employment content. In addition to
direct employment creation, a housing program is likely to have beneficial
effects on a substantial segment of manufacturers, without at the same time
generating a high demand for imports.
10.       Despite the apparent international cost disadvantage of most of
manufacturing and agricultural production in Trinidad, there are still
substantial opportunities to expand production in both areas. The Government
is considering a program to streamline the operations of the ziajor sugar
producer; sugar still retains its comparative advantage as the most economic
farm product and employs about 10 percent of the labor force. Other possible
opportunities in agriculture include a rehabilitation of cocoa, selected land
settlement and the revitalization of some areas through integrated rural
development programs. As far as manufacturing is concerned, while the more
obvious import-substitution possibilities have already been used up, a
promising beginning has been made in the export of manufactures despite the
relatively high wage levels. For the future, however, it is likely that
Trinidad will require some form of special incentives if non-traditional
exports are to rise significantly.
11.       The economic problems of Trinidad and Tobago may also be viewed
against the Caribbean regional background. In fact, some of the problems
affecting Trinidad and Tobago are found, in varying degrees, through(dt the
Caribbean area: a very high dependence on foreign trade; high levels of
unemployment, heavily concentrated among the young and unskilled; emigration,



mainly from the trained and energetic population to North America and
Western Europe. Particularly the English speaking Caribbean countries
have concluded that a regional approach to their common problems could
provide new development opportunities. In activities where various
countries compete, a common approach has been adopted, e.g., in sugar
and banana marketing. In tourism, advertising the region as a whole is
beginning.  Complementary activities, however, have lagged.  The main
institutions, which-the English-speaking Caribeean countries have set up
to bring about a more active regional development, are the Caribbean Free
Trade Association (CARIFTA) and the Caribbean Development Bank (DB).
Under CARIFTA a large number of products can now be traded freely nongz
the Commonwealth Caribbean countries. These arrangements have resulted
in a marked increase in the trade of manufactured goods between Jamaica and
Trinidad and Tobago, and from these two largest member countries of CARIFTA
to the other islands and Guyana. CARFITA's long-run intention is to develap
a common market with a common external tariff and otber coordinated policies.
12.       CDB's main initial objective is to assist the smaller Caribbean
islands in identifying and financing new development opportunities. Dhe
Bank is helping CDB, which was established at the beginning of 1970, primarily
as executing agency for a UNDP grant. Under this grant, professional staiXC i3
being provided as well as some studies. A study on the industrial developmant
potential in the Eastern Caribbean, just about to be completed, is worth
mentioning. Cn this basis, CDB is able to consider requests for financing
industrial ventures within a well-defined regional context. In 1970 and 1971
CDB has made loans totalling $6.1 million and may come to the Bank in the
forthcoming year for some financial assistance, which the Bank could not
channel direotly to the smaller territories of the area because of their
limited economic size. CDB was strenghtened in April 1972 when it opened the
door to the eventual membership of Colombia and Venezuela.
Extemal Finance
13.       The economic prospects of Trinidad and Tobago are good, as long as
a determined attack is made on some of the basic structural deficiencies out-
lined above. The external public debt does not present a constraint and
prospective service on it is low. At the end of 1971, the external public debt
totalled $116 million, of which $45 million were undisbursed and service for the
year was equivalent to about 3 percent of exports of goods and non-factor
service net of imports of crude oil. In the last six years, the Bank has been
the largest single lender accounting for almost 30 percent of total commitments,
the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIMBANK), together with U.S. commercial banks,
accounted for 23 percent, the Inter-American Development Bank (TDB) for 17
percent, and the remainder was split between official loans from Canada and
the U.K., and medium-term borrowings in the London and Euro-dollar market.

Most of Trinidadts external debt is at long term with concessional rates of
interest. Except for a $1.3 million loan for water and sewerage, IDB loans
have been extended from the Fund for Special Operations carrying 2.25 to 3.25
percent interest rates. EXD4BANK loans have been provided with interest of
5.5 to 6.0 percent.
14.       The annual external borrowing by public agencies over the seven
years, 1972-78, is expected to rise substantially and be more than double the
annual rate of borrowing over the years 1965-71. This takes no account of
the external financing which would be required for the liquified natural gas
scheme, which might be as much as $100 million. The lending programs of IDB
and the Canadian and U.K. Governments are expected to concentrate upon agri-
culture, reafforestation, education, airport improvement, and various technical
assistance programs. IDB has scheduled two educational loans for this calendar
year - vocational and farmer training, and a student loan fund - and is
considering assistance for agriculturalmarketing, extension services and
feeder roads, as well as reafforestation, and the redevelopment of East Port-
of-pain. The main Canadian Government lending is expected to be for the
East-West Corridor highway feasibility study, highway maintenance and the
Piarco airport improvement. Debt service is expected to increase to about 6
percent of exports of goods and non-factor service net of imports of crude oil
within the next five or six years, leaving Trinidad a substantial capacity to
service additional borrowings on terms similar to those of Bank loans.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
15.       In 1961 the Bank made its first loan of $21.4 million (net of
cancellation) to Trinidad and Tobago. The loan, which financed the power
development, was guaranteed by the United Kingdom. Since the country's
independence in 1962, Bank lending has totalled $30.0 million. The Bank
now holds $31.5 million, including $13.7 million not yet disbursed. Almost
one-half of the lending has been for power, almost one-fifth each for highways
and education, and the remainder for an agricultural settlement, a family
planning and a DFC project. The loan of $2.0 million to the Trinidad and
Tobago Development Finance Company was signed in May 1972 and is effeotive.
A summary statement of Bank loans to Trinidad and Tobago at August 31, 1972
is attached as Annex I.
16.       The two power projects are completed. After some initial delays,
good progress has been made on the agrioultural settlement project. Delays
in the highway project were due largely to the poor performance by the intial
consultants who were replaced in 1969. Progress on the first education
project has been good. On the family planning project there have been consid-
erable delays in the contracting of specialists who are to support the
strengthening of the offices in charge of family planning. Brief notes on
the projects in execution are given in Annex I.
17.       The Bank's past lending has been directed toward the solution of
infrastructure bottlenecks - in power and highways, toward the creation of
productive employment opportunities - in agriculture, industry and tourism
(through DFC), and towards a long-run solution of deep-seated unemployment
problems - in education and family planning. In almost all projects the Bank
provided considerable assistance in the preparation of projects and technical
assistance elements have been builbinto most of the loans extended.
18.       The Bank is at present considering two projects which should be
ready for presentation to the Executive Directors during the next six months.
A loan for a port improvement project in Port-of-Spain was negotiated in
May, but is awaiting Board presentation until the Port Authority and the
Government have submitted a tariff incr'ease application to the Public
Utilities Commission. The Government and the Port Authority also are con-
sidering including in the loan request to the Bank the financing of a
dredger to replace its existing one. The second proposal is a sugar rehabi-
litation project which has just been appraised. The project would consist of
a major rehabilitation and modernization of the physical assets and operations
of the Caroni sugar company which produces about 90 percent of the country's
sugar and employs 8 percent of its labor force.
19.       So far there have been no operations of the International Finance
Corporation in Trinidad and Tobago, which became a member of IFC only in
June 1971. As the result of an IFC mission, which visited the country in
mid-January, the Corporation has expressed an interest in several projects.



-8-
PART III - THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
The Education Structure
20.       The present education and training system in Trinidad and Tobago
is largely based on that of the U.K. It consists of:
(i)  a five-year primary course normally beginning at the age of
seven;
(ii)  a secondary course cmprising a five-year cycle leading to the
Cambridge General Certificate of Education (G.C.E.), "O" level,
followed by a two-year cycle leading to the G.C.E., "A" level;
(iii)  third level courses of three to seven-year duration at the
University of the West Indies (UWI).
Post-primary and intermediate courses are provided for those, who fail to
qualify for general secondary education.
21.       Education is free and compulsory between the ages of 6-12. Primary
education is quantitatively well developed; total enrollment in 1969/70 was
about 96 percent of the age group, evenly distributed between boys and girls
in both rural and urban areas. The Common Entrance Examination at grade 5
determines which students are admitted to public secondary schools. The
percentage of admission, which is a function of the number of student places
available in the first year of secondary schools, was about 16 percent in
1969/70. Most students who are not admitted enroll in post-primary or in
intermediate schools, both of which are generally ill-equipped, overcrowded
and understaffed. General secondary education is still relatively under-
deve-leped with total 1969/70 enrollment in public schools being about 18
percent of the age group 12-18, with an additional 8 percent attending
private secondary schools. Vocational and technical education is provided
at two technical institutes, one in Port-of-Spain and the other in San
Fernando; craft courses are also offered at a vocational training center in
Point Fortin. Educational efficiency of vocational and technical training
is low, due to the lack of qualified teaching staff, poor quality of intake
and heavy reliance on part-time courses. Two-year full time courses for
agricultural technicians are offered at the Eastern Caribbean Institute of
Agriculture and Forestry (ECIAF), which can accommodate 128 students. Below
the technician level no organized scheme exists for training adult farmers.
Higher education is carried on by UWI, a regional institution serving several
countries of the Caribbean area; in Trinidad, three-year degree courses are
offered in agriculture, arts, social sciences, engineering and natural sciences.
22.       In an attempt to make provision for the problem of the unemployed.
several programs for informal vocational education have been set up since
1966, but so far most of them have met with limited success, partly due to



-9-
lack of equipment and teaching staff. In order to coordinate vocational
and technical education, a National Training Board has been established, which
will investigate manpower requirements of the economy, elaborate standard
training programs, supervise private training schemes, and, in general, advise
the Government in planning and programming vocational and technical education
policies.  The composition of this Board - with members drawn from the public
sector, trade unions, associations of employers - should ensure an adequate feed-
back of the labor market's needs into the curricula.
23.       The need for a radical reform of the educational and training system
was first emphasized by a 1964 UNESCO educational planning mission. A draft
Plan for Educational Development 1968 - 1983 was subsequently prepared and
approved by the Government in 1967. The plan represents an ambitious attempt to
improve the efficiency of the educational system and its relevance to the needs
of the economy, by providing a better integrated system of general education
and correcting the traditional bias against vocational and technical training.
It is to be implemented in three five-year phases: first, the reform of
secondary schools and teacher training, with the primary purpose of producing
readily trainable graduates for a diversified economy; second, extension of
the reform to primary schools, vocational and agricultural training and
technical education; and third, completion of reform of primary and technical
education. It is expected that this plan will help improve social mobility,
modify social attitudes and expectations, and increase the educational
efficiency in particular of vocational and technical training.
24.       Public expenditures on education have grown at the relatively high
average rate of 10.5 percent p.a. between 1960 and 1970. In 1970 recurrent
expenditure on education absorbed about 17 percent of current revenues, which
is reasonable given the amount and composition of total enrollments. Capital
expenditures on education averaged about 11 percent of total capital expenditures
in recent years, reflecting the shifting of public investment priorities
brought about by the plans for educational reform. Total public expenditure
on education amounted to 3.6 percent of GDP in 1970, which is relatively
low compared with that of other countries at the same stage of economic deve-
lopment. By 1983 however, public expenditure on education is expected to
reach about 5.5 percent of GDP and recurrent expenditure is expected to
increase to about 25 percent of current revenues. The projected distribution
of expenditure by levels of education reflects the emphasis on reform and
consolidation of general education and on expansion of vocational and technical
trazining.
Eaternal Assistance
25.       External assistance in support of educational reform has been
provided by several bilateral and multilateral agencies. Five teacher trainers
and specialists in curricu]um development were provided during 1969-1971 by
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in conjunction with the
Bank's first education project. The Organization of American States is providing
grants to finance a crash program for retraining 150 secondary school teachers
a year. UNDP has provided five specialists in primary teacher training methods



- 10 -
and primary school curriculum for the Institute of Education at UWI.
Fellowships abroad, mainly for university students, are offered by the
Governments of Canada, U.K. and U.S.A.
26.       The Bank's first education project, for which a loan of $9.1,
million was signed on October 16, 1968, was designed to help the Government
in implementing the first phase of the reform. The project consisted of three
senior comprehensive secondary schools, sixteen junior secondary schools,
the conversion of three general secondary schools into senior comprehensive
secondary schools, and one teacher training college for primary and junior
secondary school teachers. After an initial delay of about seven months due
to difficulties in the selection of the architectural consultants and further
delays in construction resulting from labor problems and advere weather,
project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily and completion of
construction is expected by the closing date, December 31, 1973.
27.       As to the future, aside of the proposed second education loan, IDB
has scheduled two loans for the sector for this calendar year: a loan to
assist vocational and agricultural training and a loan for a student loan
fund. The first loan, of about $9.5 million for a program costing about $15.5
million, would assist in financing the construction of seven vocational training
centers, one technical teacher training unit, three farm schools and an expan-
sion of an existing vocational center. Tne second loan of $3.7 million for a
program of about $6.2 million, would assist in establishing a student loan fund,
out of which approximately 1,100 university student loans may be financed during
a maximum period of four years. In addition, the number of scholarships for
students at institutions of higher education would be increased. On the whole,
external aid is expected to finance about one-third of the capital costs of the
second phase of the educational reform.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The project was appraised in the field in January/February 1972.
Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in August 1972.
The Government was represented by Messrs. Eugene Moore, Permanent Secretary
of Planning and Development; Frank Barsotti, Permanent Secretary of Agriculture;
Walter Emmanuel, of the Ministry of Education; Y. Jamadar, of the Attorney
General's Office; L. Farfan, of the Ministry of Finance; and Miss I. Sir anan,
Second Secretary of the Embassy of Trinidad and Tobago.
Project Description
29.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project - Trinidad
and Tobago (No. PE-49a dated September 29, 1972) is being distributed separately.
The main features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III.
30.       The Second Education Project would support the reform and expansion
of general secondary education and assist the Government in extending the

it would complement another project in the field of vocational and agricul-
tural education, which is scheduled to be supported by an IDB loan, as
mentioned in paragraph 27. The Second Education Project would consist of:
(a) six junior secondary schools
(b) three senior comprehensive schools
(c) four combined junior/senior secondary schools
(d) a teacher training college
(e)  a technical institute
(f) a farmer training center
(g) three farmer training mobile units, and
(h) related technical assistance.
The new teacher training college would replace four small, underequipped and
understaffed public teacher training colleges. The proposed technical institute
involves the relocation and expansion of the San Fernando Technical Institute
and its development as an institution for the training of higher technicians
only. The residential 30-place farmer training center would be adjacent to
the Eastern Caribbean Institute of Agriculture and Forestry (ECIAF) and would
be allowed to use its equipment and farm facilities. Each farmer training
mobile unit would consist of an agricultural workshop van with portable equip-
ment for practical demonstrations and a microbus equipped with audiovisual
aids and a power generating set.
31.       The project would require revised curricula and syllabi for secondary
and technical education. New curricula for secondary education are already
available. Durricula for technical training would be revised on the basis
of a survey of technician occupations which is to be carried out by the
National Training Board. CIDA would provide the technical assistance for
this phase of the project in the form of specialists in manpower planning,
training management and job analysis and trade testing as well as scholar-
ships for the Trinidadian counterpart personnel. The new syllabi prepared
for the Bank-financed Teacher Training College in San Fernando would also
be utilized in the proposed new teacher training college. As to the
agricultural training component of the project, courses would be production-
oriented, the emphasis being on topics such as land preparation, plant
protection, animal husbandry and farm management. The Fanmer Training
Center would train both adult farmers and extension officers. CIDA would
provide the schiolarships for its coordinator and two teachers. The farmer-
training mobile units would carry out demonstrations. on selected farms in
cooperation with rural associations.   The two agricultural items are
complementary, the common objective being to upgrade the level of skills of
adult farmers, promote the introduction of better technologies in small
farms and support the Government policy of agricultural diversification and
rural development, through production-oriented courses.
32.       The proposed project would provide about 20 percent of the additional
student places required at the junior secondary level by 1983 and about 25
percent of the projected increase in capacity at the senior comprehensive



- 12 -
level; in addition, about 50 percent and 30 percent, respectively, are
being provided under the first project. This heavy Bank involvement in
the sector is justified (i) to help maintain the momentum gained by the
educational reform during the first phase of implementation and (ii) to
assist, through an improved educational system, in finding a long-term
solution to the employment and development problems in the country.
Project Implementation and Cost
33.       The project would be implemented over a period of six years.   The
Project Unit, established within the Ministry of Works for the first education
project, would be responsible for the financial and administrative control
of the second project. The Project Unit is also in charge of implementation
of the physical elements of the Bank's Population Project (Loan No. 743) and
is scheduled to supervise the proposed IDB vocational education project.
During negotiations an organizational structure for the Project Unit was
agreed upon covering the various subdivisions, their staffing, duties and
responsibilities and the need for additional supporting staff. A condition
of effectiveness of the loan would be the appointment to the Project Unit of
additional supporting staff to carry out efficiently the above mentioned
projects. In addition any new appointment of director of the Unit will be
subject to the Bank's approval, and the Bank will have to be consulted on any
new appointments to the positions of architect, accountant and procurement
officer.
34.       Technical assistance, to be financed out of the loan, would be
provided to assist the Government in the selection, procurement and
installation of equipment for the Technical Institute. Contracts for
construction, furniture, ana equipment would be awarded through international
competitive bidding. Items would be grouped to the extent practicable to
form sizeable packages to permit bulk procurement. British Commonwealth
and CARIFTA preferential treatment on import duties do not apply, since
furniture and equipment for education purposes are exempt from import duties.
35.       Upon completion of construction of the Technical Institute, the
project envisions technical assistance for teacher training and setting up
of curricula in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, electronics,
building construction and basic engineering science, as well as fellowships
for the corresponding local counterpart personnel. Although CIDA has stated
that it was not in a position to finance such a program at present, the
Government has requested CIDA to provide grant funds for it. The Government
representatives informed the Bank during negotiations that, if CIDA were able
to finance this additional technical assistance, the Government would ask the
Bank to cancel a part of the loan in a like amount, up to an amount of $0.4
million.
36.       The project is estimated to cost a total of $19.7 million equivalent
including the technical assistance costs provided by CIDA. The proposed loan
of $9.3 million would cover the foreign exchange cost of the project, excluding



the portion to be financed by CIDA, together with interest and other
charges on the loan during the construction period. The 15 years repay-
ment period from the completion of the project would be the same as under
the first loan. However, because of the prevailing fiscal and balance of
payments outlook, a grace period of ten years was accorded at that time.
At present, fiscal and balance of payments prospects for the late 1970's
are, as mentioned in paragraph 7, much better, and there is now no case
for extending the grace period beyond the construction phase.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUWENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Government of
Trinidad and Tobago, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan,
Robert S. McNamara

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
TRANSPORTATION
Highway Project (Loan 497-TR, signed June 12, 1967) - Project
execution was delayed due largely to the poor performance of the initial
consultants who were replaced late in 1969, but also because of delays
by the Ministry of Works with regard to the prequalification of contractors
and the awarding and signing of contracts; construction works are not
expected to be completed before the end of 1973, and the feasibility studies
on the road extensions possibly even later; the closing date of June 30,
1973 may have to be postponed for a second time.
AGRICULTURE
Crown Lands Development Project (Loan 486-TR, signed March 10, 1967)
- After initial difficulties, progress has been satisfactory, although due
to bad weather this year, it is unlikely that the project will be completed
before the end of the year. The closing date is December 31, 1972.
EDUCATION
Elucation Project (Loan 56h-TR, signed October 16, 1968) - After an
initial delay of about seven months, due to difficulties in the selection
of the architectural consultants and further delays in construction resulting
from labor problems and adverse weather, project implementation is now
progressing satisfactorily and completion of construction is expected by the
closing date, December 31, 1973.
FAMILY PLANNING
Population Project (Loan 743-TR, signed May 28, 1971) - The loan
was declared effective on January 31, 1972, after contractual arrangements
were ccmrpleted with the architectural hospital consultants and an architect
to head the population section of the project implementation unit. Progress
on the non-physical aspects of the project has fallen behind schedule since
various specialists have not yet been contracted for.
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE
TTDFC Project (Loan 819-TR, signed May 15, 1972) - The loan was
declared  fective on schedule on July 3, 1972; requests for reimbursement
on subloans are expected shortly.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO - SECOND EDUJCATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Surmary
I. Loan Summary
Borrower:               Trinidad and Tobago
Amount:                 US$9.3 million equivalent in various currencies.
The proposed loan corresponds to the project's
estimated foreign exchange component and interest
during construction.
Amortization:           Payable in 22 years including a 7-year period of
grace, through semi-annual installments beginning April
15, 1980 and ending October 15, 1994.
Interest Rate:          7-i percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:      3/4 of 1 percent.
II. Project Summary
Project Description:    The proposed project would assist the Government in
achieving the objectives of the 15-year educational
development plan 1968-1983 by (i) expanding the coverage
of the reform in general secondary education to urban
and rural areas insufficiently provided with educational
facilities, and (ii) extending the reform to technical
education and informal training of adult farmers to
meet manpower requirements and the need to improve
farming productivity and standards of living in rural
areas. The project would promote the pattern of secondary
education being financed under the Bank's first loan
and would complement the reform of vocational and
agricultural education which is being supported by the
Inter-American Development Bank. The project would comprise:
1. Design, construction, furnishing and equipping of
13 secondary schools (11,600 student places), 1
teacher training college (440 student places), 1
technical institute (840 student places) and 1
farmer training center (30 student places).
