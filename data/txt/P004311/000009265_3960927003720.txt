MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR A SECOND PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$58.8 million equivalent to Malaysia is submitted for approval. The pro-
posed loan with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of five years, at
the standard variable rate, would he'p finance a Second Primary and Secondary
Education Sector Project.
2.        Background.  The Government's current overall education and training
policy and strategies are the result of the long-term continuing process which
the Bank has already supported through nine education loans since 1969 for a
total amount of US$405.4 million. The Bank agreed to a Letter of Policy of
March 5, 1986, stating the Governments' objectives and strategy for primary
and secondary education, together with a plan of action for the 10-year period
1986-95. This was the basis of the first Primary and Secondary Education
Sector Project (Loan 2685-MA), which assists the Gcovernment in initiating the
implementation of its policy during the first part of the Fifth Malaysia Plan
period (1986-90).
3.        The outstanding sectoral issues to be addressed by the proposed
follow-on project are: (a) inadequate quality of education, as shown in th%
examination failure rates which result from unsuitable curriculum components
and teaching practices, inadequate teacher training, and shortage of educa-
tional resources and facilities; (b) deficiencies in the management of the
education system, mainly due to staff cons.raints and insufficient qualifica-
tions; and (c) inequitable access to education, due to imbalances in the dis-
tribution of academic facilities and insufficient provision of student and
staff accommodation.
4.        The objectives of the Government's education policy and development
plan are: (a) improving the quality oi education; (b) increasing managerial
efficiency; and (c) expanding access to better education equitably throughout
the country. These would be achieved through further developing and implemen-
ting new curricula, initiated in the early 1980s with Bank assistance; provid-
ing teaching/learning materials and equipment; improving teacher training;
training educational and managerial staff; and expanding schooling facilities
in priority areas. The Government is also undertaking further studies on
sectoral issues to be addressed under the next development plan. The Govern-
ment's plan would maintain the high rate of female participation in education
(49% in primary and secondary education, and 62% in teacher training).
5.        Fiscal constraints have compelled the Government to scale down its
original investment program for education under the Fifth Malaysia Plan from
US$1.70 billion to US$1.55 billion. However, priority is still given to
primary and general secondary education which are allocated 502 of the total
program.



6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would continue
Bank assistance to the primary and secondary education subsector being suppor-
ted by the first Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project signed in May
1986. The Bank loan would fill the resource gap in the subsector for the
remainder of the Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-90) which provides for the first
five-year phase of the 10-year education development program (1986-95). The
second phase will be financed under the next national development plan cur-
rently under preparation. The project would also build upon the long-standing
cooperation between the Government and the Bank, which has contributed to
effective institutional, policy and curriculum development in recent years.
Through the project, the Bank would continue its dialogue with the Government
on future strategies for the development of the education sector, which would
address the need for improvement and expansion of education, related fiscal
implications, and efficient implementaticn. The timing of the project would
also maintain the Government's implementation capacity at an optimum level and
would sustain the momentum of the program as the ongoing first Primary and
Secondary Education Sector Project tapers off towards completion in 1988. The
sector approach was chosen as the policy framework, agreed with the Bank, is
ih place; the Government has demonstrated adequate managerial and implementa-
tion capability; and criteria, guidelines and procedures for project implemen-
tation, similar to those agreed for the first Primary and Secondary Education
Sector Project, would be applied.
7.        Project Objective and Description.  The objective of the proposed
project ie to help accelerate changes in Government's sectoral policy and
institutions to improve the quality of education and the efficiency of educa-
tional management, and increase access to better education. The proposed
project would constitute the second of a series of sector investment loans
within the Government's 10-year program and would include: (a) a national-
level staff development program comprising 34 staff-years of overseas fellow-
ships, and local training courses for 7,400 education officers and managers;
and (b) five state-level investment programs addressing the specific needs of
the various states of the country. These programs would provide a total of
about 4,400 classrooms in about 390 primary and secondary schools; about 2,800
boarding places; staff housing to accommodate about 1,200 teachers; and 295
resource centers to provide teachers and administrators with the technological
and skills upgrading support required to improve the quality and efficiency of
their assignments.
8.        The total cost of the four-year project, beginning in January 1988,
is estimated to be US$159.8 million equivalent, including estimated duties and
taxes of US$3.7 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$58.8 million equivalent
would finance the foreign exchange component (37% of total project cost) and
would provide funds for civil works, equipment and furniture, and technical
assistance. Retroactive financing of US$5.5 million would be provided from
loan funds for eligible expenditures from January 1, 1988. This represents
the estimated amount of foreign exchange expenditures to be incurred until the
signing of the Loan Agreement. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. As project schools are
dispersed and no civil works contract is expected to exceed US$3.0 million,
they are unlikely to draw interest from international firms. About 65% of



-3-
furniture and equipment packages, because of content, are not expected to
interest foreign suppliers. Therefore, contracts for these items would be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in which
foreign firms would be allowed to participate in accordance with government
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank and have already been utilized for
previous similar projects. In order to ensure timely availability of funds
and to minimize delays in loan disbursement, a Special Account would be estab-
lished with an authorized allocation of US$4.0 million equivalent, represent-
ing the Bank's share of four months of estimated average expenditure during
the project disbursement period. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Malaysia are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. Maps of primary and secondary education in Peninsular
and East Malaysia are also included. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7344-MA,
dated June 24, 1988, is distributed separately.
9.        Actions A&reed.  Overall progress with the implementation of the
Government   10-year policy is satisfa:tory and the project would assist in
addressing outstanding issues. Therefore, the assurances provided and the
agreements reached at negotiations relate to the action required to accelerate
and improve policy implementation and to ensure sittiefactory project implemen-
tation. The Government has provided assurances that: (a) multigrade teaching
would be expanded to the extei3- possible, to increase student:teacher ratios
and class sizes and thereby make small schools more cost-efficient; (b) appro-
priate local training courses would be available for the staff development
program; (c) any savings made from the construction programs during implemen-
tation would be used to further expand school construction in the most under-
privileged districts; (d) curricular and extracurricular activities would be
spread over the entire working day to the extent possible, in schools where
single daily sessions would be reinstated, to improve curriculum delivery and
teachers' efficiency; and (e) per capita grants to schools would be increased
in amounts sufficient to offset inflation, subject to the country's financial
situation.  Agreements were also reached with the Government on:  (i) the
staff development program; (ii) criteria, procedures and guidelines for proj-
ect implementation by the Government; (iii) performance indicators; (iv) com-
prehensive implementation reporting and review meetings, to be held between
the Government and the Bank by March 31 of each year, interim physical and
financial status reporting and review by October 31 of each year, and an in-
depth mid-term review of progress towards the targets of the project by March
31, 1990; (v) arrangements for the purchase of sites in advance, and staggered
school construction programs on these sites, to be continued under subsequent
development programs, to alleviate persisting difficulties in timely acqui-
sition of suitable land; and (vi) classroom space standards.
*    10.       Benefits and Risks.  The project would benefit about 192,000 stu-
dents, particularly in underprivileged areas in terms of available schooling
facilities. Upon completion of the proposed project, complementing the first
Primary and Secondary Education Sector Project, about 8,000 key educators and
managers would be trained, as required by 1990; the new primary and junior
secondary curricula would be implemented; resource centers would provide sup-
port to about two-thirds of primary schools; teacher training capacity would
be adequate; major sectoral studies would be completed; more boarding facili-
ties would provide access to able students from the poorest segments of the
population and would help coasolidate small uneconomical schools; more staff



- 4 -
housing would help attract and retain qualified teachers in underprivileged
areas; and excessive double-shifting and overcrowding would be reduced. The
use of more cost efficient school construction standards and practices would
be expanded. Significant educational outcomes would also result from the
implementation of the new curricula which emphasize students' mastery of basic
skills and humanity's responsibility in the physical, social and technological
environment. No major risk is anticipated as the groundwork has been laid and
successfully tested under the first Primary and Secondary Education Sector
Project, and the project cost has been tailored to available budgetary
resources.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan wcsld comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that thp Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
