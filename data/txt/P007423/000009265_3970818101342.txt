PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the industrial com-
ponent of Loan 1003-JM 1I  and on Loan 1609-3M to various public sector financial
institutions.2/ Loan 1003-JM (along with its industrial component of US$1.9
million) was approved in May 1974, signed in June 1974 and disbursed by December
1983. Loan 1609-JM, of US$7.0 million, was approved in July 1978, signed in
August 1978 and disbursed also by December 1983.
The Bank's Latin America and the Caribbean Projects Department has
prepared this report on the basis of information gathered during a mission to
Jamaica in February 1984. The report presents a factual review of the various
financial institutions involved, their institutional development over time
(including their current status), and their utilization of the loan proceeds.
Comments received from the Borrower are reproduced as Annexes 7, 8 and 9.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA - SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT
(LOANS 1003 AND 1609-JM)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project, which was the first integrated small scale enterprise (SSE)
operation in Jamaica, aimed at institution building and at providing financial and
technical support to Jamaica's SSE sector. It involved, all in all, ten financial
institutions (plus the participation of seven commercial banks) and another six
non-financial agencies and governmental units (Annex I).
2.        Numerous restructuring, merging and reallocation processes during the
life of the project resulted in a use of funds which was partially different from
that intended at appraisal time for the Industrial Component of Loan 1003-JM as
well as for Loan 1609-JM (Annex II). Since both the Industrial Component of Loan
1003-JM and Loan 1609-JM were used, in the end, for identical purposes, this
completion report combines them as far as institutions were involved. They are
treated separately with regard to loan statistics and operations.
3.        Originally, under the earlier urban project (Loan 1003-JM) of 1974,
US$1.9 million was allocated for onlending to SSEs in the low-cost housing area.
This project component, however, in making the Development Venture Capital Finance
Co. (DVCF) fully responsible for its implementation without attempting to tackle
the complex problem of assisting SSEs in Jamaica on a wider scale, failed to meet
its objective (Annrx 6).
4.        Assistance to SSEs on a wider scale became the purpose of Loan 1609-3M,
a US$7.0 million project of 1978 which had two financial components (Sub-Programs
I and II) and one technical assistance component. Sub-Program I was for indirect
lending and originally amounted to US$4.5 million (at the end, to US$6.4 million);
Sub-Program II was for direct lending and originally amounted to US$2.0 million
(at the end, only to US$112,000) (para. 3.03).
5.        In summation, the indirect lending facility (focus: sophisticated,
modern SSEs) disbursed the bulk of all funds available (Loan 1003: instead of
no funds, US$1.0 million; Loan 1609: instead of US$4.5 million, US$6.4 million),
whereas the direct lending facilities (focus: very suall scale enterprises)
disbursed a negligible quantity (Loan 1003: US$573,000; Loan 1609: US$112,000
instead of a foreseen combined US$3.5 million) (paras. 3.33-3.49).
6.        In the end, however, none of the various intermediaries involved in the
lending process survived. Considerable amounts of time, money and technical
assistance had been invested without achieving the long term benefits of a
lasting, sound institutional structure for either direct or indirect lending. As



a surprise to the Bank, and without consultation, the Jamaican authorities
announced, in June 1981, that the Small Industry Finance Co. Ltd. (SIFCO) was to
be closed down as the last surviving direct lending institution under the
project. At the same time, the authorities announced the founding of a new
National Development Bank, intended to virtually duplicate the functions of the
reasonably weli performing indirect lending institution PIC, which also
discontinued operations in early 1982 (paras. 3.05-3.32, Epilogue).
7.        It should be noted that the project was implemented in a very difficult
economic environment which deteriorated even more after Loan 1609-JM had been
approved. The project was perceived as highly risky and even experimental. It
was the first Bank SSE operation in Latin America and, hence, could draw only upon
limited experience, especially in project design. Nonetheless, and despite
otherwise disappointing results, all funds reached the target group, were
disbursed in a relatively timely manner and filled a gap in foreign exchange
credit to Jamaica's SSE sector (paras. 2.05, 3.50).
8.        Considering the numerous changes during implementation, the report
concentrates on loan utilization to the extent that statistical material was
available from the defunct institutions. Because of the project's specific
nature and the fact that the institutions no longer exist, the PCR format deviates
from the regular framework and does not attempt to give a complete financial
history of the various closures, mergers and windups. However, an attempt is made
to identify reasons for the institutional instability and vulnerability and the
seemingly small absorptive capacity of the very small scale enterprise sector in
Jamaica. The lessons to be learned from the project experience are discussed in
paras 5.05-5-09.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA - SMALL SCAIE ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT
(LOANS 1003 AND 1609-JM)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In April 1976, four and a half years before the Manley regime came to an
end, the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) asked the Bank for assistance in designing
strategies to reduce the high rate of urban unemployment. A special Bank mission
visited Jamaica in November 1976 and recommended the development of a small scale
enterprise (SSE) project to increase production in manufacturing and reduce urban
unemployment. Two subsequent missions, in May and August 1977, discussed the
project concept and design and agreed with GOJ on developing an SSE project
covering the entire sector. The project was appraised in December 1977 and
approved in July 1978.
1.02      While the Bank had already been involved in the small scale sector
through the US$1.9 million industrial component of the Second Urban Project
(Loan 1003-JM)}tthe SSE project (Loan 1609-JM) was intended to be the Bank's first
integrated SSE development project in Jamaica. It was aimed at: (i) financing
modern small scale enterprises through Premier Investment Corporation (PIC) and
commercial banks; (ii) financing very small scale enterprises2/ through the Small
Enterprise Development Corporation (SEDCO), the creation of which was suggested by
the Bank to integrate small industry lending; and (iii) providing technical
assistance to SSEs to supplement both financing programs.
1.03      At the time of discussing the project concept and design, it was already
apparent that the industrial component of Loan 1003-JM was not achieving its
original objectives.3/ Therefore, the component was restructured in August 1977
and, for all practical purposes, was implemented parallel to Loan 1609-JM, using
the same institutions, once its original implementing agency, DVCF, merged with
SEDCO into what later became Small Industries Finance Corporation (SIFCO).
1.04      During the project implementation phase, the consecutive merging of
institutions created periods of low activity in terms of subproject appraisal,
approval and disbursement. By the time of the original commitment deadline of
October 31, 1981, only 53% of Loan 1609-JM had been committed.  As a result, a
year's extension of the commitment period was granted, and the loan was fully
committed in June 1982. Because of subsequent subproject substitutions (new
subprojects replaced formerly approved ones), the Loan was finally closed in June

the industrial component of Loan 1003-JM.)
1.05      This completion report reviews the development of the institutionAl
setup for SSE lending in Jamaica over the period 1977-1983 and assesses the extent
to which specific project and loan objectives were achieved. It is based on
information in the two Staff Appraisal Reports (Nos. 294a-JN and 1951a-JN), the
project files and data gathered by a project completion mission which visited
Jamaica in February 1984.
II.  THE ENVIRONMENT
2.01      Evolution of Government Policy prior to the Project.  The Government of
Jamaica began to demonstrate interest in the SSE sector in 1965, when it
established the Small Business Loan Board (SBLB), to assist the sector by
providing soft loan financing. The willingness to help the sector was,
furthermore, demonstrated in the five-year Development Plan of 1963, following
independence. Considering, however, the limited allocation of funds (US$50,000
p.a. 1965-1968) to SBLB, coupled with the-lack of other supporting actions, the
SSE sector support was seen more as a token effort.
2.02      A new attempt to increase assistance to the SSE sector was made in the
early 1970s. Increasing the scope of promotional measures, GOJ established the
Development Venture Capital Financing Co. Ltd. (DVCF) as a branch of the Jamaica
Development Bank (JDB) and set up a Small Industries Development Division (SIDD)
within the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC). A Small Business
Financing Schem. -iBFS), aiming at stimulating the commercial banking sector into
SSE financing by --oviding guarantees, followed in 1975.
2.03      Sector Strategy. GOJ's long term development strategy in the
manufacturing sector had, at the time of project appraisal, the following major
objectives:
(a) reducing import dependence;
(b) generating additional export earnings; and
(c) promoting SSEs and crafts, coupled with employment generation.



-3-
Two specific policy measures4/ were supposed to assist the manufacturing sector
in achieving these objectives, namely realistic exchange rate and restrictive wage
policies.
2.04      It can be concluded, however, that none of the three preceding
objectives were met successfully during the time of project implementation. While
GOJ intended to overhaul its industrial incentives so that there would be greater
reliance upon domestic sources of supply and the substitution of labor for
imported capital equipment, no specific changes were achieved before the project
commitments ended in 1982. Plans had been made to place particular emphasis upon
the modification of the relative prices of capital and labor and the promotion of
industries which would process mostly local raw materials. Such industries in
Jamaica are of the following types: food processing, furniture, garments,
footwear, metal casting, leather goods, wooden toys and metal products. As most
end-users of the SSE project came from these subsectors and were labor-intensive,
the project itself, at the outset, fitted well with the overall intentions.
2.05      Sector Performance.  The sector performance was affected by severe
disturbances especially during the second half of the 1970s.  Throughout tbe
lifetime of the project, Jamaica experienced both external and internal negative
growth. Although the first three years of the decade had repeated the brisk
growth performance of the 1960s, the 1973-1980 period showed a steady decline in
in all sectors of the economy.5/ In 1980, real GDP stood 18% below the 1973
peak, and investment expenditures declined from 22% of GDP in 1974 to about 13Z in
1980. Major declines were consequently experienced in the manufacturing sector.
2.06      During the same period, unemployment rose, i.e., from a level of 21Z in
1974 to 28% in 1980.6/ Only in 1981 and 1982, toward the end of the project, did
the economy register some positive growth. Construction, manufacturing and
distribution were then the leading growth sectors. Domestically, the Government's
program to tackle unemployment coincided with the deterioration in the external
4/  Other measures which had been considered included imposing import duty on
capital goods, reducing depreciation allowances, and granting tax credit and
other incentives to firms hiring additional workers. These measures, coupled
with the modification in wage and exchange rate policies, were to exert a
positive influence on the future development of Jamaica's manufacturing
sector.
5/  The increase in energy cost, the impact of the mid-decade recession in the
industrial countries, and the increased interest rates in international
capital markets all affected Jamaica negatively. Furthermore, inadequate
macro- and public finance policies, as well as controls on capital flows, led
to a bad business climate and to a lack of confidence in the private sector.
(The vicious cycle of public sector deficit, money being printed, capital
outflow and balance-of-payments deficit continued without interruption.)
6/  Unemployment was even more acute for youths and women, with rates of 60% and
39% respectively. The original intention of the industrial component of Loan
1003-JM, to aim precisely at this target group, was actually a well chosen one
but was, unfortunately, not successfully implemented. Nonetheless, as
paragraph 5.03 concludes, some positive results were achieved in the end.



-4-
and internal environment and eventually led to a disruption of production. At the
same time, an increasingly populist image of the Government destroyed the
confidence of the private sector, contributing to a reduction of productive
investment and to an increase in the outflow of capital and skilled manpower.
Production, which had peaked in 1973, declined 31Z by 1980. The apparent cause
was the unavailability of imported inputs arising from the shortage of foreign
exchange. The unfavorable investment climate led producers to shelve expansion
plans.  Furthermore, low capacity utilization reduced demand for fixed assets.
Although manufactured exports registered some nominal growth during the period,
they did not compensate for the decline in the domestic economy. Coutrary to
intentions, the prevailing structure of incentives, resulting from a protective
system based on quantative restrictions, made sales to extra regional markets -
even for small scale companies - less profitable than sales to the sheltered but
limited CARICOM market, and these, in turn, less profitable than sales to the
domestic market.
2.07      For a developing country of just over two million inhabitants, Jamaica
has an industrial sector7/ which produces a wide variety of manufactured
products. During the life of the project, the sector had been hampered by a lack
of raw materials and spare parts resulting from the acute foreign exchange
shortage, a declining domestic market, and a virtual halt of investment activities
of the private sector. The slow performance of the project can be ascribed mainly
to these factors.
2.08      Jamaican manufacturing industries have enjoyed high levels of
protection, which lead to high profit margins, under-utilized capacity,
technological inefficiencies, and some cost penalties associated with small scale
production. The resulting industrial base is, therefore, fragmented into small
and inefficient producers, most of whom operate one shift and produce a wide
variety of products. By 1980, the sector was operating below 60% capacity and, in
some cases, even as low as 30%, partly as a result of the concentration on the
local market.
2.09      In summary, the manufacturing sector -- together with agriculture and
tourism -- was viewed as having major potential for growth and, in particular, for
an immediate expansion of exports. However, it suffered from four major problems:
(a) an orientation toward the domestic market and against exports, because of the
structure of incentives; (b) low capacity utilization, as a result of earlier
investments and high protection; (c) outmoded, inappropriate, and badly run-down
capital equipment, caused by a lack of investment during the 1970s and the
unavailability of foreign exchange for spare parts; and (d) in general, a poor
investment climate.
7/ To characterize its magnitude, Jamaica's manufacturing sector contributed
J$ 721.2 million, or 15.3%, to GDP in 1980, at which time the project had
virtually come to an end. The sector then employed 76,700 persons,
representing 10.6% of total employment.



III. THE PROJECTS
A. Main Objectives
3.01      Loan 1003-JM - The original objective of the industrial component of the
Sites and Services Project was to introduce some employment opportunities to the
low-cost housing project under Loan 1003-JM. The project was to provide training
and jobs for an idle labor force and to help stabilize newly created communities.
This objective, however, was changed when it became apparent that the project
was suffering from many implementation problems.8/ By January 1976, a poor
micro-economic and political environment led to violence on project sites and to a
lack of investors for small industries and qualified professionals for project
staff. The industrial component had thus to be restrucLured to remove its spacial
focus; it became a traditional development finance company operation to channel
funds through DVCF. The objective of the project component was still to create
jobs, but, after its restructuring in 1977, DVCF was permitted to carry out a much
more expanded role in the execution of the component.
3.02      Loan 1609-JM - The objectives of the integrated program for SSEs (Loan
1609-JM) of 1978 were much broader and can be summarized in the following five
points:
(a) Support GOJ's development objectives by providing much needed foreign
exchange for SSEs to import essential raw materials and intermediate goods,
machinery and equipment (including spare parts) as necessary;
(b) Involve the commercial banking system in medium- and long-term lending to
SSEs in the productive sectors (manufacturing, agroindustry, and
construction);
(c) Assist GOJ in establishing SEDCO as a viable and effective institution for
servicing very small enterprises;
(d) Increase the flow of bankable projects to financial intermediaries by
providing focused technical assistance services; and
(e) Provide a framework for a dialogue with GGJ on industrial policies (such as
revising the then existing industrial incentive schemes to provide more
stimulus for exports), partly by instituting systematic data collection
relevant to SSEs.        -
3.03      To carry out these objectives, Loan 1609-JM had two distinct financing
Sub-Programs. Sub-Program I, the original financing of US$4.5 million to modern
8/ See paragraph 23 of the completion report on Loan 1003-JM dated February 24,
1984,prepared by the Urban Division, as well as Annex 6 of this PCR.



-6-
small scale enterprises9/. was proposed to be -zlent by GOJ to the Bank of
Jamaica (BOJ) to establish the rediscounting facility to be administered by PIC.
Maximmm subloan amounts under this subprogram were US$100,000. BOJ accredited any
commercial bank which made a commitment to create an adequately staffed project
unit to build up expertise in appraising SSE projects. Projects were to be
identified either through entrepreneurs approaching the participating banks or
through Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC). For a project needing
assistance, the participating bank had to indicate its interest, and JIDC was to
assist in the project preparation (see also Technical Assistance, para 4.03).
Sub-Program II consisted of a direct lending amount, originally of US$2.0 million,
to be channeled through SEDCO.  It was intended to reach, directly, those
subborrowers who might otherwise not have been acceptable to commercial banks
because of a lack of track record and adequate collateral.
3.04      The institutional aspects as well as the loan utilization will - for
reasons of clarity - be divided into indirect lending and direct lending
considerations since the objectives of these two types of lending were different,
and since, in the end, the total disbursement under the direct lending part was
very marginal (US$685,000), whereas the indirect portion increased by more than
40% of its original allocation. Annex 2 provides an overview of the indirect
versus the direct lending.
B. Institutional Aspects of Both Loans
Ci) Indirect Lending
3.05      Role of PIC.  The indirect lending was composed of the following two
portions:      (a) two-thirds of the industrial component of Loan 1003-JM and (b)
Sub-Program I of Loan 1609-JM. It was PIC which, apart from inheriting the
proceeds of Loan 1003-JM, mainly implemented the indirect funds (Sub-Program I) of
Loan 1609-JM, under which US$4.5 million were originally scheduled to be onlent.
This original allucation was increased in September 1982 to US$6.4 million, of
which US$6.25 million were disbursed at the end. Additionally, from reallocated
proceeds of Loan 1003-JM amounting to US$1.3 million, US$0.978 million were also
disbursed by PIC.
3.C6      Created in 1975 as a subsidiary of BOJ, PIC was originally intended to
implement a guarantee fund, called the Small Business Financing Scheme, before it
9/ For the purpose of Loan 1609-JM, the SSE sector was grouped into two, to
reflect the  modern small-scale enterprise  served by Sub-Program I as having a
net asset limit of J$ 100,000 (excluding land and building) and an employee
limit of 50, and the "very small enterprise" served by Sub-Program II, with
corresponding figures of J$ 20,000 and 10. The term "small industries was not
defined for Loan 1003-JM.



-7-
was chosen as a rediscounter of Bank funds, along with a revised guarantee
scheme.101 In carrying out this function, PIC's role was to:
(a)   determine the eligibility of loans for rediscounting;
(b)  coordinate and monitor the performance of the participating financial
intermediaries and technical assistance agencies under the project;
(c) administer an expanded loan guarantee scbeme; and
(d)  develop a project appraisal manual in consultation with the participating
banks.
3.07      As a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Jamaica, PIC implemented the
project between 1978 and 1982 with a staff of five, of which three were
professionals, all coming from the Central Bank and continuing to be employed by
that institution as well. Under the technical assistance portion of Loan
1609-JM, two foreign consultants (with a one-year tenure each) were giving
assistance, particularly in project appraisal, between September 1978 and
September 1980.
3.08      Operational since February 1, 1979, PIC began to function slowly, and
project implementation suffered from problems of project concept and institutional
weaknesses. Disbursements were less than 50% of appraisal estimates by year 2 of
project implementation, mainly because of less-than-adequate staffing,Ll/ a
resulting limitation regarding promotional efforts and the reluctance of
commercial banks to undertake preparation and appraisal of subprojects (see
following paragraphs).
3.09      Commercial Bank Participation.  As a result of PIC's low-key
performance, Sub-Program I and, later, the reallocated portions of Sub-Program II
as well as funds from Loan 1003-IM were channeled mainly because of the acute
foreign exchange shortage. The maximum subloan amount under the program was
US$100,000, and any participating bank could rediscount up to 100% of the specific
loan amount (which was always done), subject to a ceiling of 65% of total
subproject cost. The commitments of the various commercial banks, to create an
adequately staffed project unit which would build up expertise in appraising SSE
projects, did not materialize. The banks claimed that such a specialization would
have been too expensive since the outstanding balance under the rediscounting
facility never surpassed 1% of their overall lending portfolio. The loan amount
10/To encourage commercial banks to increase long-term credits to the SSE sector,
the original scheme had to be revised because of a reluctance of commercial
banks to use it between 1975 and L977, as the result of a low maximum loan
amount of J$ 25,000 and the low spreads. (Interest rates for installment and
commercial credit during this period were higher than the onlending rate
(12-1/2%) allowed under the original scheme.)
11/According to an f'iterim assessment, the general impression was, furthermore,
that PlC's staff carried out its functions with a certain lack of enthusiasm
and interest. It appeared from joint visits to factories that officers were
not too conversant in terms of industrial management and development.



of US$4.5 million, to be distributed to seven participating banks, was marginal
and did not trigger any special effort from -he banks.  Interviews with the four
largest users among the banks participatinf under the program also revealed that
the Guarantee Scheme, even in its revised1 / version, was never a decisive factor
for making a loan. This was mainly the result of a lack of confidence in GOJ to
effect actual payments, should they ever come due. On the contrary, what clearly
served as an attraction to use the funds was the foreign exchange feature and the
fact that repayment was made in local currency, with GOJ taking the foreign
exchange risk for a 1Z fee, explaining why, once the original loans were repayed,
no revolvement of funds occurred.13/  Instead, PIC invested the accumulated back
flow of local currency in treasury bills (three months) and housing and commercial
trust funds (six months), giving it an average return of 1OZ to 11Z. Another
reason for not lending out the back flow a second or third time was the high level
of liquidity in local currency in the banking system existing throughout the
project period.
3.10      It had been planned that the funds available under the 1609-JM
Sub-Program I would be committed more or less evenly over a period of five years.
An additional reason for the aforementioned moderate takeoff phase was the initial
slow response of the commercial banks, which did not want to get involved in what
they considered costly appraisal efforts. Once PIC assumed the marginal appraisal
work, onlending moved briskly to facilitate the purchase of raw material. To the
extent that PIC took over the -appraisal responsibility from the commercial
banks, a prime objective of the project was not achieved.
3.11      The increase in demand for funds after the initial delay was also caused
by the onlending rate of 16.5% under the project being about 4 points lower than
the average prevailing market rate. The result was an attractive subsidy.
3.12      A notable feature of the Sub-Program I portfolio with PIC is the marked
rate of early repayments. While the average term of lending to subborrowers was
about three years, more than half of the loans disbursed had already been repaid
18 months after approval, another 40% after 28 months. This development took
place in spite of a penalty rate of between 1% and 3% (corresponding to the
prepayment year) and underlines the character of the program, being, in the end,
perceived as a mere foreign exchange transaction. The main reason for early
repayments was to free the collateral of the subborrowers which, in turn, allowed
them to reapply. Several companies received three consecutive loans under the
12/Under the revised scheme, BOJ guaranteed up to 50% of the loan amount against a
one-time fee of 1%, to be paid by the final borrower. (Expecting the
subborrower to pay for it was probably a mistake.) The maximum guarantee per
loan had been raised from about USS20,000 (J$ 25,000) to US$50,000 or 50% of
any loan that could be rediscounted, whichever was smaller. No restrictions
regarding the interest rate were applied.
13/Even though not foreseen at appraisal time, BOJ planned to provide PIC with an
additional foreign exchange fund of US$0.5 million. The allocation of these
funds, however, could not be freely decided. BOJ reviewed each application and
gave its decision according to its priorities, which were never defined to
PIC. By May 1981, US$0.39 million of this fund were committed. The remainder,
kept in reserve for especially urgent cases, was never allocated.



project, each time in foreign exchange. According to the banks, these companies
saw their participation in the scheme either as part of a service to customers
with whom a relationship had been established, or as something they had been
pushed into by customer demand and which could not have been avoided since the
Bank loan was the only active source of foreign exchange to the SSE sector.
3.13      The "40/60- condition14/ imposed under the terms of the 1609/1003-JM
loans was often seen as a clause to force the client to buy unnecessary assets in
order to get access to urgently needed raw material.15/ This condition was later
dropped.
3.14      Regarding the appraisal techniques introduced,16/ the banks and PIC
stated that, in the majority of the cases, a good track record was of far greater
importance than a formal appraisal. It was also maintained that a planning
horizon of five years was scarcely realistic under Jamaican conditions as required
per Bank-imposed projection computations. Another point raised was that the PIC
appraisals did not take into account the fact that the continuity of foreign
exchange supply was by no way assured and that, for this reason, some subprojects,
seemingly feasible, had an inherent high risk factor because the projections had
been made on the assumption of an unlimited supply of foreign exchange.
3.15      Because of this high risk factor, banks were, at times, requiring
collateral with a coverage of up to 130X of the loan amount, even if these
collaterals were cash deposits. As previously mentioned, the guarantee scheme was
not considered a decisive factor but, rather, as something additional in those
cases where there might have existed some doubt concerning the clients' track
record. No case exists in which a payout was actually made. The banks maintained
that only about 6% of all clients were new customers.
3.16      Regarding dissemination of information, the banks pointed out that even
those among them with a large participation in the program could not afford to
keep all their officers and branch managers posted about the program all the
time. Of all seven participating banks, with a combined 130 branches spread over
the -sland, 45 staff members originally participated in orientation courses.
3.17      The spread under the loans was considered adequate by the banks.  While,
in comparison, the 4.5 percentage point spread seemed low in nominal terms when
compared with the normal spread of 8 to 8.5 percentage points of commercial banks
in Jamaica in the late 1970s/early 1980s for term lending, the effective spread
was about 4 percentage points, once liquidity requirements and cost of funds were
taken into consideration.
14/A subloan under the program had to include a 40% portion for the
financing of fixed assets.
15/During several subproject visits on various supervision missions, it was found
that machinery, three to six months after arrival, was still crated, or
unpacked but not installed. Subborrowers explained that the items were not
really needed, but rather bought in order to have access to raw material to
prevent the operation from closing down.
16/In practice, the commercial banks were never involved directly in the appraisal
work that PIC had taken over to avoid delays.



- 10 -
3.18      In general, the commercial banks looked at the PIC rediscounting
mechanism as a temporary facility which was too small in volume and too short in
time. Their suspicion was justified when PIC's operations were discontinued de
facto in 1982.
(ii) Direct Lending
3.19      The direct lending was composed of the following two portions:
(a) one-third of the industrial component of Loan 1003-JM and (b) the Sub-Program
II of Loan 1609-JM (see Diagram in Annex 2). Originally, the entire industrial
component of Loan 1003-JM was to be lent directly through DVCF.  Sub-Program I of
Loan 1609 was originally US$2.0 million, but a substantial portion of it was never
committed by direct lending institutions, and most of it was reallocated, over
time, to PIC, where its orientation became one of indirect lending and, thus, no
longer had, as an objective, the financing of very small scale enterprises. Under
both Bank loans, US$685,000 were disbursed to the various "very small scale
enterprises," with net fixed assets, prior to applying for a loan (excluding land
and building), of up to US$20,000 equivalent. The three institutions, DVCF, SEDCO
and SIFCO, none of which exist any longer, were involved in the direct lending
process.
3.20      DVCF's role.  DVCF was incorporated as an affiliated company of JDB in
March 1973 and began operations in August 1973. DVCF's objectives, as specified
in its Memorandum of Association, were quite varied.  The philosophy of JDB's
management and the Government was to use DVCF as a vehicle to assist "high riskt
projects by granting loans, making equity investments and providing guarantees and
technical assistance. DVCF financed projects in all sectors. Specific criteria
adopted by DVCF in selecting projects were:
(a) their capacity to create jobs, save or generate foreign exchange, and
utilize local raw materials;
(b) their capacity to expand the base of Jamaican ownership and
entrepreneurial skills.
DVCF's lending criteria, based on the preceding objectives, were much less
stringent than the normal lending criteria of JDB's Industrial Projects
Department.
3.21      Since JDB's Industrial Projects Department also financed projects below
J$ 50,000, which was DVCF's maximum limit, DVCF-financed projects were almost
exclusively of a high-risk nature. In part, they were forced upon DVCF, the Board
of which was identical to that of JDB. Consequently, and in view of political
influence, DVCF incurred substantial losses and was decapitalized. However, it
was recapitalized again during 1977 and adopted a number of Bank recommendations
following the reorientation of the 1003-JM industrial credit component.
3.22      When the Bank began discussions with the Government, in early 1977, to
restructure the industrial portion of Loan 1003-JM in order to expedite its
implementation, it was agreed that the component would be transformed into a small
industries scheme to be implemented by DVCF. DVCF was strengthened and



- 11 -
restructured to operate as a small industry window of JDB, lending to viable
SSEs. In this connection, the following actions were taken:
(a) DVCF adopted a new, comprehensive statement of investment and financial
policy;
(b) DVCF was adequately recapitalized, and provisions were wade for losses on its
then existing portfolio;
(c)  A new maaager, two project officers and a loan supervision officer were
employed; and
(d) DVCF's lending rate was raised from 9-10% to 11% p.a. for all loans.
The implementation of this action program was completed in August 1977, and DVCF
started its lending operations in late 1977.
3.23      Despite substantial improvement during 1978, the return on equity was
only 1%, and, during early 1979, the institution was again incurring losses.  The
portfolio still had 40% of arrears of six months and above and never recovered
from the heavy losses prior to the reorganization period.  Furthermore, a major
factor in the disruption of DVCF's operation was the inaction of the Board, which
did not meet for almost three mDnths in early 1979. Since all loans required
Board authorization, loan approvals stopped. A lower-than-expected credit demand
as a result of lack of confidence in GOJ caused further delays in implementing the
lending program. Consequently, staff morale dropped, key project officers
resigned, and the hiring process was halted pending GOJ's decision concerning an
eventual integration of DVCF and SEDCO (para 3.28).
3.24      SEDCO.  The original recipient of the direct lending portion of Loan
1609-JM, SEDCO, faced operational problems similar to those experienced by DVCF.
Established in November 1977 as a wholly-owned Government company, SEDCO was to
undertake credit and technical assistance functions formerly performed by the
Small Business Loan Board (SBLB)l7/ and the Small Industrial Development
17/ SBLB, also a GOJ institution, was founded in 1965. However, it had no
guidelines specifying its operating policies, project appraisal and/or loan
supervision methods. Also, the institution clearly lacked the managerial,
technical and financial resources to make any significant impact on the SSE
sector development. Last but not least, it was subject to political
influence. Up to 1977, SBLB had received about J$ 7.0 million in grants from
GOJ, but since its accounts had not been audited, the value of its assets was
uncertain (50% of the portfolio was affected by arrears). During negotiations
of Loan 1609-JM, it was agreed that GOJ was to take the necessary action to
transfer the assets of SBLB to a special fund of SEDCO.

Division (SIDD).18/ The Bank played a substantial role ln the creation of SEDCO,
which was to integrate small industry lending, even though its nature was more
promotional than financial.
3.25      SEDCO, once formed out of SBLB and SIDD, was to be strengthened under
the project. About nine months after loan negotiations, SEDCO's staff had
increased from 15 to 43, despite the low volume of lending.  However, few of
SEDCO's officers had solid banking experience. The quality of the GOJ-appointed
management was not ideal for operating a complex lending program. Salary levels,
tied to pay scales in the public sector, were low compared to those of the private
sector. Greater autonomy was needed, but SEDCO's budget was provided directly
from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Also, from the start, it was not
certain whether the projected operating expenses could have been covered
realistically from the lending operation spreadl9/ (SEDCO did not assume,but was
subsequently forced to take over, SBLB's staff).
3.26      The scope of operations set for SEDCO was rather ambitious considering
that it was a new institution with young and inexperienced project evaluation
officers. The difficulties of merging SBLB with SEDCO had been underestimated to
the extent that SBLB was known as a soft loan window which did not enforce
repayments. This fact made it particularly difficult to enforce stringent lending
policies in SEDCO. Furthermore, SEDCO continued to operate subject to political
influence. The overall philosophy of GOJ remained that virtually everybody in
Jamaica could be turned into an entrepreneur as long as technical assistance and
funds were provided. Often, disbursements were made prior to legally finalizing
the loan contracts.
3.27      Because of poor management, lack of public confidence in the staff or
the Government and substantial losses, the Cabinet finally decided, in September
1979, to phase out SEDCO and merge it with DVCF. By that time, staff morale was
very low, and two major department heads had resigned.
3.28      SEDCO 8O/SIFCO.  The merger decision between DVCF and SEDCO was
implemented during the first quarter of 1980. It was GOJ's intention to create
one sound institution20/ rather than support two malfunctioning ones. Headed by
18/ SIDD was created in 1973 as a subsidiary of the Jamaica Industrial Development
Division, aso a Government entity. It was to assist SSEs by preparing
feasibility studies, providing market research for products, assisting in raw
material supply and equipment procurement and guiding in factory accommodating
and layout and by helping to prepare loan applications for the varicus lending
institutions. SIDD, however, was ineffective, and, in January 1978, its
budget allocations and functions were transferred to SEDCO.
iS; At the time of appraisal, it was clear that, in order to become financially
viable, SEDCO would have needed a spread of 9 percentage points. This spread
could have been obtained by charging a high interest rate, e.g., 15% p.a., but
SEDCO was not willing to charge more than 11%. This involved an element of
subsidy.

the former general manager of DVCF, the new institution was at first named SEDCO
80" and started operations on October 1, 1980. Once the new Government had taken
over, DVCF's Board decided to rename the institution "Small Industries Finance
Corporation, Ltd." (SIFCO)- SIFCO's management, retained from DVCF, was able
to recruit a goud team of mainly young professionals. However, no Board was
appointed until March 1981.
3.29      With the creation of SEDCO 80, a number of amendments had to be made to
the loan documents once the Bank had agreed to the merger.  Much effort went into
assisting the official merger committee because the Bank believed that SIFCO could
be developed into an effective institution.
3.30      SIFCO's new authorized capital was J$ 5.0 million, of which J$ 2.75 was
paid in. Total staff comprised 37 persons, of whom 20 were professionals in three
major departments (Projects, Finance and Administration), some of which had been
inherited from DVCF.
3.31      For operational purposes, SIFCO unified Loans 1003-1N and 1609-JM, but,
for accounting purposes, each loan portfolio remained separate. SIFCO never
committed any funds of Loan 1609-JM, and only US$201,000 were committed
(US$169,000 disbursed) under Loan 1003-JM. Because of the short period of just
one month between Board appointment in March 1981 and the cessation of lending in
April 1981, in the wake of a revision of public finance institutions by the new
administration. By June 1981, winding-up procedures had been instituted, but
administration of the existing loans has continued. All unused Bank funds under
both loans were reallocated to PIC.
3.32      SIFCO's net portfolio was reduced to J$ 4.5 million at the time of
suspension of lending operations, after J$ 6.3 million in bad loans (mainly
derived from SBLB) had been written off. Thus, the number of accounts dropped
from 3,000 to only about 250 for SBLB, 120 for SEDCO and 130 for DVCF. Despite
thls considerable in-house consolidation, the arrears situation remained
serious: 20% (J$ 0.9 million) of the portfolio consisted of principal arrears and
5% (J$ 0.23 million) of interest arrears. Measures employed by the management to
remedy this situation - more aggressive collection methods and seizures - resulted
in substantial improvements in the months preceding April 1981. Also, the rate
of commitments in the first quarter of 1981 had been 60% over that of the first
quarter of 1980. However, the bad record of SBLB, the failure of SEDCO and the
arrears situation of the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) all seem to have carried
more weight in the Government's decision to close down SIFCO than did SIFCO's
actual performance.21/
C. Loan Utilization
(i) Indirect Lending
3.33      Loan 1609-JM, Sub-Program I, PIC.  PIC was exclusively responsible for
the processing of Sub-Program 1, in addition to the processing of reallocated

(in volume) as had SEDCO during its entire existence.

portions of the Industrial Component of Loan 1003-JM. Of the total amount of
US$6.39 million allocated to PIC under Loan 1609-JM (after several reallocations
from Sub-Program II to I), US$6.25 million were actually disbursed for a total of
130 subprojects, out of which 34 were above the free limit. Annex 5 provides
summary statistics on loan utilization for subprojects financed under Sub-Program
I of Loan 1609-JM.
3.34      The SAR estimated that about 100 enterprises would receive financing
from PIC through the commercial banks participating under the scheme. Considering
that PIC's original allocation of US$4.5 million was increased by about 40% and
the subproject number increased by 30% as a result, it can be concluded that the
original estimated relationship between the financing amount and the number of
projects has been maintained. The average loan size was estimated to be about
US$50,000 equivalent.
3.35      Proceeds of the loan went to companies covering all segments of
subsectoral activities, from garments (28 loans) and furniture manufacturing (18
loans) to chemical (11 loans) and electrical processing (2 loans). Of the 130
loans, 120 were located in the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Total original job
creation as submitted at time of subproject appraisal was 1,014, with an average
Bank financing of about US$6,000 per job. Because of a lack of pertinent
information, an exact amount in US$ equivalent of project cost per job (including
increased working capital) can only be estimated at approximately US$10,000.22/
3.36      The allocation of loan funds to the participating banks was fairly well
distributed. Of the seven banks participating in PIC's lending scheme, two were
responsible for over 50% of all commitments (by amounts), whereas the remaining
five divided the balance in declining percentages. The exact distribution of the
disbursed US$6.25 million was as follows: Royal Bank, 31.6%; National Commercial
Bank, 20.1%; Bank of Nova Scotia, 16.7%; Bank of Commerce, 11.1%; Jamaica Citizens
Bank, 10.6%; Workers Savings Bank, 4.7%; and Citibank, 1.7%. The remaining 3.5%
are in the portfolio of the former Development Venture Capital Finance Co. (DVCF),
which had originally participated in the scheme as another intermediary.
3.37      In view of the large number of subprojects, as is the case in any SSE
project, the loan utilization summary given in Annex 5 is somewhat condensed. It
should be noted that the arrears under Sub-Program I are extremely low; they
amount to a total of the J$ equivalent of US$80,000 and consist of only eight
cases (out of 130).  The commercial banks profess to be monitoring all eight cases
closely while assuring that the underlying problems are temporary, except for one
case in which the assets were seized.
3.38      Loan 1003 - Indirect Lending (PIC).  Once DVCF and SIFCO had committed,
for direct lending purposes, US$872,000 equivalent at the time they were merged
and closed, the remaining balance of the Industrial Component of Loan 1003-JM
(US$1,228,000) was transferred to PIC for execution along with PIC's funds under
Loan 1609-JM, and, accordingly, became available for indirect lending purposes.
22/ Because of a substantial exchange rate shift over the life of the project,
this figure is only approximate.



- 15 -
3.39      The balance was used as follows:  US$578,000 equivalent were coimitted
(US$554,000 equivalent disbursed) for four AW projects above the free limit of
US$100,000, amounting to almost equally US$140,000 each (chemical, garments and
printing) and US$450,000 equivalent were committed (US$444,000 disbursed) for nine
wB projects, below the free limit, ranging between US$10,000 and US$98,000.
3.40      Of this total of 13 subprojects, 10 were located in the Kingston
metropolitan area. Almost equally represented were garments, food processing,
printing, furniture, plastic and metal. The total number of jobs created amounted
to 76.
(ii) Direct Lending
3.41      Loan 1609 - (Sub-Program II).  Annex 3 lists the subprojects financed
under Sub-Program II of Loan 1609-JM.
3.42      SEDCO was exclusively responsible for the entire processing of
Sub-Program II under the project. Even though SEDCO became SIFCO in 1980, the
SEDCO portfolio has been kept separate, for accounting purposes, until this date.
The original allocation shrank over time through several reallocations to
Sub-Program I, which was executed by PIC. At the end, US$112,000, or 5% of the
original amount of US$2.0 million, had been used by SEDCO.
3.43      Out of this amount, SEDCO financed 28 projects, nine of which were above
the free limit. The majority of the loans were made in 1978/79. All 28 projects
qualified, at the time of their approval, in terms of helping potential
entrepreneurs who were not acceptable clients to commercial banks because of a
lack of track record or adequate collateral.
3.44      The overall result of this loan component, however, is rather
disappointing. Two-thirds of the businesses which received financing are no
longer in operation. Except for two o-ut of the 28, all have arrears exceeding
three months, in most cases exceeding one year. Most of those which are reported
closed can no longer be located. As a result of some foreclosures in early 1984,
SIFCO was able to auction off a few seized assets and thus was able to lower some
of the potential losses. However, according to the administrator of the skeleton
SIFC0 shell, most of the pending balances will have to be written off.
3.45      It can reasonably be concluded that this project component did not
achieve an increase in the number of bankable projects in the sector, as was
expected at the time of appraisal.
3.46      In only one case did the maximum loan size exceed the US$20,000 limit
established in the Loan Agreement. The average Bank loan size was US$4,000, which
represented 50% of the average SEDCO loan size to the client.
3.47      All loans were made to very traditional manufacturing entities.  Eleven
of the 28 loans went to garment manufacturers, others to furniture, leather crafts
and saw mills. Three loans went to mDre developed types of manufacturing, e.g.,
metal, chemical and fiber glass production. Nineteen of the 28 loans went to
projects located in the Kingston metropolitan area, and they provided for 130 of

the overall 177 jobs originally created.  As mentioned before, no estimate can be
given regarding how many of these jobs survived.
3.48      Loan 1003-JM, Direct Lending (DVCF and SIFCO).  Before the major portion
of Loan 1003-JM was reallocated to PIC for indirect lending, US$670,000 were
committed by DVCF (of which US$404,000 were disbursed) for its original purposes,
and, after DVCF's merger with SEDCO into SIFCO, another US$201,000 were committed
(US$169,000 disbursed).
3.49      This total disbursement of US$573,000 was made for 19 projects which
received funds from SIFCO (18 located in metropolitan Kingston, total original job
creation 421) and seven projects which received funds from DVCF. A statistical
overview of the 26 DVCF/SIFCO projects is presented in Annex 4. It shows that,
compared to the Bank-financed SEDCO portfolio as described in paragraph 3.44, the
DVCF/SIFCO record is better. Out of the 26 projects, "only" seven are closed,
whereas 15 still existing firms have substantial arrears, all over three months.
The original job creation was 390, which was reduced by 75 because of the seven
closures. As a result, the long term job creation or job maintenance was also
better. All projects were below the free limit.
D. Achievement of Objectives
3.50      The two Bank loans achieved their objectives with varying degrees of
success. On the one hand, given the adverse macro-economic environment, it must
be noted that all funds were distributed to the target group (SSE), and that they
were disbursed relatively on time. On the other hand, medium and long term
financing of small scale enterprises for investment and working capital was not
achieved since most of the loans, as evidenced by early repayment, were of
short term duration. Frequently, the access to foreigr. exchange was the
prevailing factor of loan demands, because financing for the expansion in
capacity, as originally analyzed in the SAR, was not really necessary. Therefore,
demand for fixed assets was replaced by demand for working capital.
3.51      The project did not bring about any greater participation by the
commercial banks in SSE financing, either through the provision of their own
additional funds or through the financing of many new clients.23/ As per PIC's
latest status report of September 1982, projects financed through the commercial
banks contained a local finaxnce component of about 18% of the total value. The
banks could not say whether or not this financing would have been made available
without the Bank's loan. The stringent demand for collateral, including cash
deposits often required as security for loans, could have prevented many otherwise
eligible clients from having access to the funds.
23/ Even though the criteria were met formally, the type of subborrower was, in
several cases, not a small scale entrepreneur but was, rather, e.g. a
subsidiary of a large chain store of a furniture concern employing more than
100 workers,etc.



- 17 -
3.53      The decentralization target was not achieved since only 61 of all the
subborrowers were located outside the Kingston metropolitan area; if measured by
the amount of borrowed funds, this percentage is even lower.
3.54      The SSE subsectors intended to be promoted with priority by the Bank
loan were garments, food processing, woodwork, footwear, light metals, building
materials, and crafts. This objective was adhered to with regard to garments,
food processing and woodwork, with crafts heading the list. Specifically, within
the indirect lending of Sub-Program I, garments and footwear were the subsectors
receiving the highest share of loan funds (231) followed by chemical industry
(17%), furniture (11%), food industry (8%) and electric appliances (7%).  The
garment industry was also the major beneficiary of Sub-Program II and Loan 1003-JM
(direct lending),with 39% and 34% respectively. The food industry had a major
share in Loan 1003-JM (21%) while, in Sub-Program II, woodwork and crafts ranked
second (28%).
3.55      The employment creation expected to be generated from the Bank's SSE
lending in Jamaica was 2,360 (Loan 1003-JM: 1,000; Loan 1609-JM: 1,360). Because
of the uncertain status of many companies which received funds, and because of
insufficient data, there is no possibility of ascertaining whether this target was
achieved. A sample survey,24/ taken during an interim assessment in 1981, had
concluded that there was no evidence of new jobs actually having been created
under the PIC program, while SIFCO/SEDCO/DVCF lending may have created, directly
or indirectly, at least 70, and possibly up to 100, new jobs. If this was a
representative sample, the corresponding figures cou'ld have reached an overall 500
to 790 respectively. However, because of the closure of many companies, the
creation of any new employment remains subject to speculation.
3.56      One qualitative conclusion can be drawn, however.  There was ample
evidence that the Bank's lending was directly related at least to maintaining
employment, which otherwise might have been reduced. With the deterioration of
the economy, maintaining employment became much more urgent than creating new
employment. This maintenance was achieved mainly through the purchase of raw
material, which kept companies afloat for at least one or two more business
seasons. Also, intentionally or not, the tendency in favor of female employment
under the original design of Loan 1003-JM was achieved through the promotion of
the garment industry, which employed exclusively female labor.
-IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
4.01      Loan 1609-JM had funds allocated for technical assistance which amounted
to US$0.5 million.25/ These funds were to be used for direct institutional
support as well as for support to companies through selected institutions.
24/ Franz C. Helm: Jamaica; A View at the Effectiveness of SSE Lending, June/July
1981, Part IV and Annex 2.
25/The proposed allocation was: US$50,000 BOJ/PIC (one man-year assistance);
US$50,000 JIDC (for consultant and extension services); US$150,000 SEDCO (for
three man-years in advisory assistance) and US$250,000 unallocated.



- 18 -
4.02      There were numerous institutions involved in providing various types of
technical assistance to industry in Jamaica, and the Bank commissioned a special
report on the subject in 1976.26/ The conclusions were as follows: medium and
larger scale enterprises (including the -modern SSEs," target group of Sub-Program
I) received assistance from the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC)
and the Jamaica National Export Corporation (JNEC). Very small scale enterprises
(target group of Sub-Program II), were served by two institutions, the Small
Industries Development Division (SIDD) of JIDC and the Small Business Development
Center (SBDC).
4.03      Furthermore, and without catering specifically to either of the
identified target groups, a number of other institutions27/ overlapped with the
various assistance functions. Inevitably, this overlapping of functions led to a
fragmentation of programs and the absence of coordination. To overcome these
multifaceted arrangements, the Bank designed a technical assistance strategy to be
implemented parallel to the loans.
4.04      Regarding the modern small scale industries, JIDC was to assume the
implementation of TA through its technical assistance unit; it was expected to
assist entrepreneurs in preparing investment plans suitable for commercial bank
financing and to provide assistance during project implementation. A so-called
Project Coordinating Committee (PCC), composed of representatives of PIC, JIDC,
JNEC/JETCO, the Trade Administrator and thle participating commercial banks, was to
be responsible for coordination, but it never convened.
4.05      A portion of the funds to JIDC was used for a consultant who prepared
selected industrial profiles; however, there was little or no followup on these
profiles. The two consultants who assisted PIC played important roles in getting
the institution started, as well as in promoting the program, an assignment which
the participating banks failed to fulfill.
4.06      Regarding the very small scale industries, GOJ had recognized that there
was no single institution in Jamaica which could have assisted this target group
effectively. Therefore, under the project, SEDCO was to be supported in order to
assume the role of a multifunctional institution which provided not only
financing, but also technical assistance.
4.07      While the Bank financed a consultant company to give institutional
support to SEDCO as well as direct technical assistance to very small enterprises
while appraising them, SEDCO, with its own resources, also commissioned a
US$100,000 SSE survey with which the institution overextended itself, since it was
not generating enough income to cover the cost of this type of activity.
4.08      Total technical assistance disbursements under Loan 1609-3d amounted to
US$409,000. The effects of this financial assistance from the Bank are difficult
to measure, i.e., the various consultant services and the preparation of manuals

27/Among them, the Jamaica Export Trading Company (JETCO), Industrial Assistance
Programme - Bureau of Standards, Small Business Association, etc.



- 19 -
for SEDCO, PIC and JIDC28/ were effective only to the extent that they
facilitated the commitment of loan funds. Since none of the assisted institutions
survived, no lasting effects were achieved- Effects the TA might have had at the
enterprise level cannot be evaluated. Except for US$172,000,2'I it can not be
established what purposes T& amounts were actually committed for, because of
the lack of documentation.
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A. Sumary
5.01      The Bank's basic SSE project in Jamaica was Loan 1609-JM:  it comprised
two Sub-Programs.  Sub-Program I was intended generally to support modern  SSEs
through a subsidiary of Jamaica's Central Bank, the Premier Investment Corporation
(PIC). Sub-Program II was intended generally to support smaller, less
sophisticated SSEs through the Small Enterprise Development Corporation (SEDCO).
During project execution, however, the distinction between zhe two Sub-Programs
and, hence, between the two types of SSE clientele became blurred. Moreover,
Sub-Program II never got far off the ground. To strengthen it, SEDCO was
eventually merged with the Development Venture Capital Financing (DVCF), which had
received other Bank funds through the SSE component of Loan 1003-JM, an urban
shelter project; the merged institution was later named the Small Industries
Finance Company (SIFCO). However, SIFCO, in turn, was never given time to operate
on a substantial scale. Despite SIFCO's strong efforts to develop staff and
procedures on its own, the Governmet did not appoint the Board needed to
authorize major loans of SIFCO until only one month prior to the winding down of
its operations. Also, PIC, once Bank funds were disbursed, stopped lending
operations.
B. Conclusions
5.02      Achievement of Objectives.  The achievement of objectives must be
measured in light of the difficult economic environment during the execution of
the project. This included severe setbacks such as lack of water and electricity,
compounded by a drop of purchasing power in the small market, fe-wer exports and
even physical violence. It furthermore included a change of Government
accompanied by changes in philosophy. Also, the resulting lack of demand for
fixed asset financing, which substantially influenced the allocation of funds,
caused a deviation from the original objectives; as a result, these objectives
have been met only partially. However, the much needed foreign exchange for
enterprises for the importation of essential raw materials and some intermediate
goods was provided. The expected institutional improve-wents and the lasting
effects to the benefiting enterprises were below expectations.

management changes and lack of understanding of the program.

5.03      Under Sub-Program I of Loan 1609-JM and under the Industrial Component
of Loan 1003-JM, the performance was especially poor. Neither on the
institutional, nor on the receiving enterprise level, did any results live up to
expectations. Very few funds were actually disbursed, and none of the three
main direct lending institutions survived, nor did many of the very small scale
enterprises which benefited from these funds.
5.04      Regarding Sub-Program II of Loan 1609-JM (and subsequent transfers from           *
-ub-Program I and the Industrial Component of Loan 1003-JM), channeled through
PIC, it should be noted that the performance record of that institution, as well
as of the companies involved, was better.  Again, however, after considerable
efforts had been made to put it on a proper footing, the institution did not
survive, and the one-time provision of foreign exchange to the companies was about
the only positive effect. However, in questioning this effect, one might argue:
(a) that, through a more realistic foreign exchange policy, the artificial
shortage of foreign exchange could have been better allocated and capital flight
could have been prevented; (b) that, because of a large number of prepayments, the
focus was much more short term and less term credit related; (c) that, since the
industrial sector policies did not change during the project, many of the domestic
market-oriented 'modern SSEs which received the foreign exchange through PIC
could have purchased it elsewhere for a premium of 15Z to 20% because the domestic
market was protected and allowed for high cost operators; and (d) that the
commercial banks showed no interest in making use of the presumably revolving
funds accumulating in PIC once these funds had lost their -hard currency" feature.
5.05      Lessons to be learned.  First and foremost, the basic design of the
2roject was based on the need for asset financing for Jamaica's SSE sector; with
hindsight, this analysis was incorrect. Even prior to designing the project
concept, capacity utilization was low. As a result, working capital, instead of
fixed assets, was the major financing requirement. This fact was recognized
towards the middle of the loan when all remainder financing was made available for
pure working capital financing. The structure of the subproject appraisal work
was, therefore, wrongly focused and fullfilled mostly bureaucratic requirements-
5.06      Second, the loan was made before detailed statistical information
regarding the SSE sector was available. Therefore, the concept of dividing the
recipients into 'modern" and "very small scale' SSEs was questionable, especially
when specific amounts of funds were allocated to the-;e separate target groups
without a knowledge of how many of them really existed. Because of the size of
the Jamaican industrial sector and its operators, a specific SSE loan was probably
not necessary, and a regular industrial credit would have been more appropriate.
5.07      Third, regarding institutional development, Jamaica should stop seeking
solutions by the creation of additional agencies, be it for the SSEs or for the
industrial sector in general. This dictum applies for financing as well as for
technical assistance. An economy with 2 million people, and only a limited number
of industrial enterprises which want to borrow, cannot afford the variety of
institutional support that was, and still is, in existence. Companies visited
during the completion mission complained about the instability and uncertainty, as
well as the confusion, created by too many institutions, each with its many forms
and application formats. (It is not seldom that companies show liabilities with



- 21 -
SBLB, DVCF, SEDCO, SIFCO, PIC, Rehabilitation Fund, Export Development Fund and
NDB, all in one balance sheet.) In retrospect, it might have been more
straightforward to cancel the proceeds of Loan 1003-JM, once DVCF was merged with
SEDCO or once SIFCO was wound down, instead of agreeing to the numerous
reallocations, which were time-consuming for both Jamaica and the Bamk and very
little was actually achieved in the end. Considering the history of institutional
development in Jamaica before the integrated SSE project, the Bank should have
suggested a more consolidated institutional approach before going ahead. (This
might have saved time on formal aspects such as loan amendments, changes of
policies, procedures, appraisal standards, handbooks, formats, and reporting
requirements during the mergers-) Specifically, the creation of SEDCO was
questionable, since the institution had no economies of scale and was bound to be
subsidized from the start. Also, the fact that different institutions reported to
different ministries made a coherent approach almost impossible- In the view of
those to whom the loans were made, namely the numerous SSE enterprises as end
users, the Bank seems to have lost credibility in agreeing to changes decided by
the Jamaican authorities, instead of having promoted a more simple scheme with
realistic, not overly burdensome, information requirements.
-        5.08       Fourth, whenever technical assistance is a crucial element of an
institution-building effort, it is more likely to be effective if provided and
administered by one source- Under the project, technical assistance was given to
JIDC, SEDCO, DVCF, PIC and the Department of Statistics. A so-called coordination
committee was ineffective. Once the various institutions discontinued their
operations, the technical assistance for institutional development was virtually
spent in vain (none of the formerly trained officers ended up is the latest
institution, the NDB) and little responsiblity for followup was assumed by any one
institution as evidenced by a PILC/Department of Statistics manufacture survey
which, four years past its due date, still has not been completed-
5.09      Fifth, the intermediation process did not solve the dilemma of
commercial banks being unable to reach new clients, especially the less
sophisticated ones. On the contrary, the banks succeeded in placing the foreign
exchange mostly among their well known clients, with little or no risk, and still
received a spread of 3-4 points. As a lesson to learn, it should not be expected
that commercial banks in Jamaica will assume an active role in
development-oriented lending, and, therefore, this concept should not be repeated
in the future.

EPILOGUE
The situation in the industrial sector institutions continues to be
multi-faceted.  After announcement of the closing down of SIFCO in mid-1981, GOJ
established a new financial institution, the National Development Bank (NDB); its
main objective was to take over the indirect lending functions of PIC, but not the
direct lending of SIFCO. As a consequence, and in order to avoid another
overlapping, PIC was phased out in 1982.
Even though provided for in its policies, NDB does not, at present, lend
directly, but wholesales through participating commercial banks. However, project
appraisal work is not done by the commercial banks but by NDB, which started off
with very junior project staff having only moderate experience. NDB was
inaugurated in November 1982 and made its first loans in local currency in late
1983. It received financial assistance (loans and equity) from foreign
institutions (European Investment Bank, Caribbean Development Bank, IBRD), but bad
not yet disbursed foreign exchange by the end of the first quarter of 1984.
Meanwhile, other industrial financing by offical institutions
continues, even though the intention, in creating NDB, was to unify all lending
activities under the NDB umbrella. As a result, an enterprise in Jamaica has,
besides turning to its commercial bank only, the option of receiving permanent
working capital financing from the IDB-funded Rehabilitation Fund (through the
Central Bank), fixed asset and permanent working capital financing through NDB,
replacement financing from the Export Development Fund's medium term facility (if
the enterprise exports a minimum portion of its production), and term financing
from the Agricultural Credit Bank, if the enterprise is active in the
agroindustrial field.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SMALL SCALE EZITERPRISE DEVELOPMENT
Loans 1003-JM and 1609-JM
Evolution of Industrial Component of Sites and Services Project
1.        The industrial component of the Sites and Services Project was designed
to provide employment opportunities to the low-cost housing project under Loan
1003-JM. It was to provide training and jobs to a then idle labor force,/ and
was to help stabilize the newly created communities. It was to be an innovative
and attractive approach to help remedy deteriorating urban conditions, and was,
through the creation of income earning capacity for the poor, to improve income
distribution in the Kingston area.
2.        Because of insufficient private entrepreneurship, the Government decided
to entrust a state organization with the responsibility of promoting a number of
small industrial enterprises under this project component.2/ The Jamaica
Industrial Development Corporation (JIDC), was to act as sponsor and technical
adviser and to provide half of the equity capital of each small enterprise.
3.        The Jamaica Development Bank (JDB), was to appraise each industrial
subproject to determine its viability and was to make a loan available to the
small enterprise in order for it to finance equipment and factory building. JDB
was also to take a share of equity capital and assist in obtaining additional
necessary finance for working capital purposes.
4.        Private participation in the enterprises' equty capital was
encouraged. Furthermore, it was the intention that, after a few years of
successful operation, JIDC would sell part or its whole majority ownership to
interested private parties and/or local worker cooperatives.
5.        The overall project suffered from many implementation problems,
including management deficie-ncies and insufficient counterpart finance.    By
1/ Specifically, 10-20 enterprises were to be launched over a three-year period
starting in 1974, creating about 1,000 new jobs. Besides satisfying the usual
feasibility criteria (economic, financial and technical), subprojects under
the loan component were to aim at high labor-intensiveness to be achieved
through (a) small investment per job created (approximately J$ 3,000 to
5,000) and (b) lower level of required skills and short training periods.
Since statistics of 1972/73 showed unemployment highest among females between
15 and 24 years of age, it was decided to bias employment toward young women
(including simultaneous day-care facilities for their children).
2/ The component was originally supposed to partially finance 10-20 industries to
be established on the project sites, creating about 1,000 new jobs for site
residents.

January 1976, a poor micro-economic and political environment led to violence on
project sites, as well as a lack of investors for small industries and qualified
professionals for project staff. The industrial component had thus to be
restructured to remove its spacial focus: it became a traditional development
finance company operation to channel funds through the Development Venture Finance
Corporation (DVCF).  In the end, 39 projects received financing, thus enabling the
creation of about 400 new jobs. None of the industries, however, is near the
housing sites as was originally foreseen, and it is unlikely that any site
resident have actually benefited.
7.        With hindsight, one can note several unrealistic expectations in the
original design:3/ the industries planned were much larger than the average in
Jamaica (75 employees versus a median for Jamaica of 37); the required debt/equity
ratio (60:40) for the component was quite stringent given local conditions
(debt/equity ratios of 75:25 and 85:15 were usual locally); the industries were
expected to hire residents of housing areas before these residents had even been
identified; and the component required a level of coordination and management
expertise which could not have been expected from the identified institutions.
The worsening micro-economic conditions also reduced the availability of willing
investors and attractive opportunities.
3/ As evidenced by some constraints imposed under the Loan Agreement such as:
(a) Projects were to be identified by the Jamaica Industrial Development
Corporation (JIDC), a Government institution operating under the Ministry
of Industry, Trade and Tourism, which was responsible for the promotion
of industrial development. JIDC had the responsibility of preparing the
project feasibility studies and finding private entrepreneurs who were
willing to invest in the proposed enterprise and who had the necessary
managerial expertise.
(b) The industrial enterprises were to be located on land leased by them
from the Government. Although the Loan Agreement did not specify where
the Government-owned land was located, JIDC presumed it would have been
located within the physical boundaries of the sites and services
projects.
*           (c'  JIDC was to construct the factories to be sold to the enterprises and was
to receive both cash (75% of the cost of each factory) and shares (25% of
the cost) in the enterprise as payment.
(d) The debt/equity ratio of any company owning an industrial enterprise was
not to exceed 60:40.
(e) Permanent working capital could not be financed from the Bank loan.
(f) The private entrepreneurs forming the company were to own at least 51% of
the company, and the remaining share capital would have been owned by the
JIDC and the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB).

8.        In any case, it is doubtful wbether a small component of this type
should have been included in what was essentially a shelter project because,
first, job creation issues cannot be solved within a specific neighborhood, as was
expected in the project; and, second, the amount of attention required to
formulate, manage and supervise the component was disproportionate to both the
investment and its expected impact.

7he Planning Institute of Jamaica (PI01r) is generally in
agreement with the cntent of the Project .aport. in

Annex 1

fi  1974- The correct date is 1965.
Another apparently factual error was reference to the new

The - ip1.emation- delay. and slow -zate .of dibursemt ex-
perienced by this project primarily because of its shifting frTo
organisation to organisation has also been expei  in other pro-
jects.
We find the staterent that the "resulting indusrialL base Is...
fragmenbed intz snall and ificient pro ers" not quite ccrrect,
since Jamaica's base has quite a nunber of large and nediu sie
manufacturers in manufacturing and agriculture. Nevertheless, the prob-
len  which producers genera:ly are said to have faced during the
period of the Project are correct.
As far as the main objectives of Loan 1069 JM are conerned,
the Plannng Institute of Jamaica thinks that it was unrealistic to
have bad the aim of inwolving the caomercial banking sysn in the
project without first having been assured that the banks were disposed
tbo such involvement. Experience has been that coirmmercial banks
do zot have the capability nor the desire to get involved in activi-
ties of this nature.  It is, therefore, rot surprising that the
commercial banks used the facilities of the project primarily to

support lcng term ,secured" clientele, and that they requied an
excess of 100% security fExn other persons wlo used the fund.
bhe poor performce of the organisais managing the fund was
xot unexpected because project, personel in Jamaica are even nore
scare than oter skilled personel, and each organisation was am-
peting for the same project preparation and analysis type staff which
Centrl Cvexnment needed and coud not secure.
Oher conditions such as liquidity in local CUrrenCy in the
banding system t    ht  the project period may not have necerily
influenced the use of the project funcs to a large extet, had there
been adequate project suoervisory staff.
Te Planning Institute of Ja-aica has found that small enter-
prises a  either reluctant or unable to do business with c <inrcial
banks because of high inteest rates arxl eKtre  security/collateral
requirezents, and the project did rot really seek to develop any new
collateral            which w-ld give g      e hasis to  perfoace
within the asset wrth. In addition, the general flcow of loan funds-
Fr  Bank of Jamaica to enteprise, t       rcl banks with added
spreads to cover  inistration or other costs created an unduly high
rate of interest which could have been avoided had the loan been nore
institutinally-specific. moreover, observation would have showed
that the Develcpment venture Capital Financing organisation's lending
criteria were not Much less strngent in practice, altxxigh on paper
they may have appeared so-
Generally, the specific criteria relating to job creation and
generation of foreign exchange and local raw materials used were
added to otber no..al insttutional  requirements as a basis for select-
ing  projects for funding. the need for the institut is in the pE-
ject to charge an additional 9 percentage points in order to be Einan-
cially viable underscores the inefficient institution performance and
defeated the purpose of the loan.
The emphasis on metropolitan manufacturing firms in the loan
spread was not surprising, since most of the rural area oompanies
had been made inactive over the preceding years. It was, therefore,

reasonable to have redirected both loan funds into wrking capital
suwort whic was the area of demand most justified at the tinm.
The perIforman  in terms of viability, loan re-paynt and
job creaLtin after the re-allocatio  of funds, does suport and
justify the re-alnocati. The fact that the high rate of arrears
in loan 1069 3M was not the case in loan 1003 M appears to be the
most vixicating factor for re-directing the loan.
It is rather surprisin  that the Tehnic             Disburse-
mrnts were so inadeate despite the fact that personel and traXning
have     tionally been the greatest gaps ... and the highet
needed ccmmocdity" for snaU industries' deeent. Nevertheless,
the fact that other stit   wre administerin  technical assisp-
tance funds did seem to have cxntributed to the low use of the
technical assistance element of the programme.
The "Lessons to be Learnt" aspects of the report was quite a
useful support.

ments made in that section.
