MEMORANDUI AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A LOESS PLATEAU WATERSHED REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandua and recomenda-
tion on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of China for
SDR 106.3 million ($150.0 million equivalent) to help finance a Loose Plateau
Watershed Rehabilitation Project. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years. The proceeds of the development
credit would be made available to the provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi
and the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia on terms satisfactory to IDA. The
provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi and the autonomous region of Inner
Mongolia will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Soil Erosion in China.  The total land area in China subject to
erosion is estimated to be 147 million hectares (16 percent of the total land
area); an estimated 5 billion tons of topsoil are eroded annually. The
Chinese estimate that the losses of key nutrients from this process are nearly
equivalent to the nation's total annual fertilizer production. Historically,
soil erosion problems have been most severe along the upper-middle reaches of
the Yellow River, with roughly one third of the nation's total erosion taking
place in the Loess Plateau along the Yellow River alone, Most of this huge
plateau is a semi-desertic wasteland composed of rugged landforms covered with
a thick layer of wind-deposited, highly erodible looes soils. Despite efforts
to counteract soil erosion since the 1950s, erosion problems have intensified,
with an estimated 30 percent more land affected by erosion today than in 1949.
Other areas of particular concern are along the Yangtze River, in which ero-
sion is estimated to have doubled since the 1950s, and in Sichuan Province, in
which erosion is estimated to have more than quadrupled since the 1950.. In
south China, where soils are gonerally thinner, susceptibility to erosion-
caused productivity losses is much higher.
3.        Rural Povertv. While absolute poverty in China is low among the
urban population, it is restricted almost entirely to resource constrained
remote upland areas.l/ The incidence of absolute poverty in China fell from
roughly a third of the population in 1978 to less than one tenth in 1985 and
since has, remained roughly constant at around 9 percent. The decline from
1978-85 coincided with the implementation of the production responsibility
system and the increased application of improved agricultural techniques which
resulted in rapid productivity gains. The majority of the decline so induced
was among the rural poor in less remote and less hilly areas. The rapid
reductions through agricultural growth mostly finished by the end of 1984.
The residual poor have remained trapped in more remote upland areas where
making such gains is much more difficult.

-2-
4.        Chinese authorities see a special challenge in developing the
remote, resource-deficient areas in northern, northwestern and southwestern
China including the provinces of the Loess Plateau region. The Loess Plateau
agricultural environment has limited production potential due to climatic
constraints and extensive environmental degradation. Agricultural productiv-
ity and incomes were further diminished in the 1960s and 1970s when Looes
Plateau farmers were encouraged to switch from semi-pastoralism to grain cul-
tivation on mar8inal land as part of a national policy to achieve local self-
sufficiency in grain. Furthermore the population growth and consequent reduc-
tion in per capita area of arable land reduces the likelihood of the resource
base meeting minimum requirements for farm outputs and income. Relief funds
and grain sold at subsidized prices are provided to the poor to help them meet
minimum food requirements. Social services to the rural poor receive limited
outside help. Village schools generally receive little financial support from
higher levels for either facilities or salaries.
5,        Based on 1992 statistics, the rural per capita income in the project
areas was only Y 305 which is about 52 percent of the project provincial rural
average of Y 587 and less than 39 percent of the national rural average of
Y 784. More than half of the rural population lived below the poverty line of
Y 300 per capita per annum. Birth rates, population growth rates and illiter-
acy rates are all substantially higher while the population of school-age
children enrolled was lower than the national and provincial averages. Unfa-
vorable natural conditions (insufficient water s4pply, and erosion), frequent
natural disasters (drought, wind storm, and sand storms), inconvenient trans-
portation facilities, poor education and public health facilities, infectious
and endemic diseases (fluoride toxicosis, hyperthyroidism) are among the main
causes of the severe poverty in the area.
6.        Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations.  IDA has financed two
projects in China with distinctive watershed rehabilitation components.
Interesting lessons have been learned from the soil and water conservation
component of the Gansu Provincial Development Project (Ln. 2812/Cr. 1764-CHA)
which focused on the development of poor areas in Dingxi County (the Guanxuan
River Basin) on the Loess Plateau. The implementation record of this compo-
nent has been excellent and has involved local government agencies at all
levels-province, prefecture, county, township and village. Close consultation
with the beneficiaries was a key to success, while the strong focus on high
technical standards and Improved technology has led to physical implementation
standards above those estimated at appraisal. The Red Soils Project (Cr.
1733-CHA) in southern China also was successfully based on watershed develop-
ment activity, although constraints and solutions differ from those on the
Loess Plateau. Farmers in the red soils area have to cope with low soil fer-
tility, but have sufficient water resources available, as opposed to the situ-
ation on the Loess Plateau where the production potential of the basically
fertile soils is underutilized as a result of limited soil moisture.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA support for the project will
further three key elements of IDA's mandate and of the Government's national
development policy. It will alleviate poverty through development of areas
with relatively poor resource endowments, raise productivity of marginal
lands, and enhance the environment through effective land and soil conserva-
tion practices. The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy presented to the



- 3 -
Board in August 1993 highlighted a need to support intervention in the agri-
cultural sector aimed at income enhancement and poverty alleviation in regions
of absolute poverty. The proposed project is fully consistent with that stra-
tegy, delivering a tested vatershed development package to resource-poor
remote upland areas of the Loess Plateau.
8.        Proiect Objectives.  The project's main objective is to increase
agricultural production and incomes on 15,600 km' of land in the Loess Plateau
in nine tributary watersheds of the Yellow River. A secondary objective-to
reduce sediment inflows to the Yellow River-is achieved by locating the proj-
ect areas in the parts of the Basin with severe soil erosion. Factors such as
poverty level, strong leadership and commitment at the local government level
were also considered in the selection of project areas. The project will
(a) create sustainable crop production on high-yielding level farmland and
thereby replace the areas devoted to crops on erodible slope lands, (b) plant
the slope lands to a range of trees, shrubs and grasses for land stabilization
and the production of fuel, timber and fodder, and (c) substantially reduce
sediment runoff from slope lands and gullies.
9.        Prolect Descrintion.  The project would provide, over eight years,
various forms of land development ana erosion control works in Inner Mongolia,
Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, procurement of construction materials, construc-
tion equipment and vehicles; and measures to support programs of applied agri-
cultural research in topics relevant to the Looss Plateau, including training
and study tours, and an institutional development component to strengthen
project management.
10.       The project components are as follows:  Terracing is planned for
$3,200 ha and will be carried out on slope lands with slopes between 5 and 25
degrees.  The conversion of slope lands to terraces serves a number of pur-
poses. First, it creates a better environment for crop production through
moisture conservation; in a year of average rainfall, grain yields on terraces
are more than twice as high as on slope lands, and are several times higher in
a dry year. Second, terraced land is more resistant to damaging soil erosion
during intense storms than slope land. And third, sediment runoff is much
lower from terraces than from sloped land.
11.       Afforestation is planned for 270,000 ha.  This will consist of
shrubs and trees that have been found suitable for the various soils and
topography found in the project areas. Afforestation will be contracted out
to farmers for tending and for controlled grazing. This component will
increase the forest cover in the project areas from 14 percent to 38 percent
and it will significantly reduce soil erosion. It will help to relieve a
shortage of timber, forage, fodder and fuel wood in the project areas. Par-
ticipating villages are expected to develop an area management plan and assign
individuals to control livestock grazing, particularly during the first few
years after planting; this system has worked well in recent years.
12.       Orchards are planned for 279000 ha, of which 20,000 ha will be fruit
orchards (mainly apple) and 7,000 ha will be planted to Chinese date and vari-
ous nut species. Excellent quality fruit can be produced in the project area.
and, currently, domestic demand far exceeds production.



- 4 -
13.       Grasslands to be established on 155,000 ha will greatly increase the
fodder supply and hence increase the sustainable livestock carrying capacity
of the project areas. The grasslands will be contracted out to individual
farmers who will tend, protect and harvest the areas for their own profit.
14.       Sediment Control Dams.  Sediment control dams to be constructed
under the project would serve several functions: sediment retention, flood
control, and storage of water for irrigation and village water supply. A
sediment control dam is normally built first on a watershed as part of a
development plan which provides for smaller structures on upstream tributaries
soon after the completion of the key dam. The dams are homogenous earth-fill
embankments built in deeply incised gullies. The areas submerged by the dams
consist of eroded slopes and gully beds and are uninhabited. The project
includes 236 key dams and 2,208 smaller dams. Of the latter, over 90 percent
would have a storage capacity under 100,000 cubic meters, built in the gullies
upstream and downstream of the larger dams. Their main purpose would be to
capture sediment flowing in from the sides of the gullies.
15.       Warpina Land.  In three watersheds in Inner Mongolia, about 2,000 ha
of new, level farm land will be formed by diverting silt-laden river water to
waste lands along the rivers. Since the land is close to the rivers it will
be irrigated. Elsewhere in the project area, about 3,400 ha will be formed by
sediment trapped by dams and gully control works.
16.       Irrigation.  Most of the project irrigation is planned for Inner
Mongolia, where 5,500 ha wil be irrigated in small units of 20 to 30 ha along
three rivers on lands reclaimed or protected by the project works. Shallow
tubowells will be the source of water for most of them, but some will be sup-
plied by pumping from the water impounded by silt control or diversion dams.
Much of the irrigation will be for orchards.
17.       Gully Control.  In the project areas of Inner Mongolia and Gansu the
gully beds are narrow and lend themselves to control by low brush dams built
across the gullies at 20- to 30-m intervals. The effect is to slow the veloc-
ity of flow during floods and thereby reduce undercutting of slopes which
often leads to landslides. Measures are also adopted, especially in the gul-
lied plateau landform, to arrest erosion at the heads of gullies. Shrubs are
planted along the edges of the gully heads, and small dams are built in the
gullies.
18.       Institutional Develovment.  This component of the project will
increase the strength of the Upper and Middle Reach Bureau (UMRB) of the
Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) capacity as a leading agency for
soil and water conservation in the Yellow River Basin, and the provinces and
prefectures will be better equipped to meet the formidable challenge of devel-
oping the Loess Plateau. Also, since the project will be implemented largely
by the villagers living in the watersheds, there will be a need for farn er
training on a much larger scale than in earlier projects. Effective and
timely training will call for new approaches and new facilities at the county
and prefecture levels. The institutional development component will finance
the following items: (a) construction and equipping of training centers at
the provincial, prefecture and county levels; (b) vehicles and equipment for
extension serviceas (c) hardware, software and related training for geographic



- 5 -
information systems (GIS), computer aided design (CAD), and project informa-
tion systems management; (d) overseas training and study tours; and (e) the
services of external experts for Technical Panels.
19.       Prolect Imyle_entation.  The proVosed project vould be carried out
by the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR), its UMRB and the soil and water
conservation bureaus of the four participating provinces/autonomous region..
The project cost is estimated at about $248.7 million equivalent, with a for-
eign exchange component of $24.2 million equivalent (10 percent). The Asso-
ciation would finance SDR 106.3 million ($150 million equivalent) (100 percent
of the foreign exchange and 56 percent of local costs). To allow a rapid
start-up of project works, retroactive financing of up to SDR 7 million ($10
million equivalent) has been recommended to cover expenditures for planning
and design of one third of the subwatersheds, land development and locally
procured goods incurred between November 15, 1993 and the date of signing of
the Credit Agreement. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the
People's Republic of China are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12593-CBA, dated
May 3, 1994, is being distributed separately.
20.       Project Sustsinability.  The project's main aim is to convert unsus-
tainable agricultural production practices into a sustainable system of opti-
mized resource utilization. Previous projects on the Loess Plateau have, on a
smaller scale, proven the effectiveness and sustainability of the comprehen-
sive soil and water conservation package to be applied under this project.
21.       Atreed Actions.  Agreements were obtained (a) that the project will
comply with agreed technical standards for design, review, construction, and
maintenance of hydraulic structures; (b) that for participating households the
minimum land tenure contract terms will be 30 years for orchards, terraces and
newly formed farmland; and that all other land will have a minimum contract
period of 50 years; (c) that separate accounts for the project wil. be main-
tained and IDA auditing requirements will be met; (ts) that the proj Oct manage-
ment offices at all levels are maintained with functions and responsibilities
acceptable to IDA and staffed adequately; (e) a detailed annual budget and
work plan will be furnished for IDA review by November 30 of each year; and
(f) that a mid-term review of the project by September 30, 1997 would be
undertaken jointly with IDA.
22.       Environmental Aspects.  The project will lead to significant change.
in land use. Large areas of waste and unused land carrying poor quality
grass, shrubs and trees will be planted to more suitable and productive vari-
eties. The overall effects of these land use changes will be to preserve the
land resource, and increase productivity in an environmentally sustainable
manner. The land under forest and shrubs will increase from 210,000 ha to
590,000 ha. Of the area of 430,000 ha presently devoted to field crops, about
110,000 ha of the more steeply sloping land will be converted to forests. The
remaining 320,000 ha under crops will be on higher-yielding lands which will
be terraced to improved standards. There will be a small increase in the area



- 6 -
of grassland, but much of the existing grassland will be replanted to grasses
with higher livestock carrying capacities, and will be managed by individual
farmers or farmer groups. Various types of dams will intercept virtually all
of the sediment from the areas they control, and this will have significant
downstream benefits; the dams will eliminate destructive flash floods, provide
water for irrigation and other uses, and the sediment deposited upstream of
the dams will form high quality farm land.
23.       The project has been planned and designed in close consultation with
those villages with the right to cultivate the land being developed. The
increased productivity is estimated to more than double per capita farm
incomes at full development. Thus, the project has a significant impact in
terms of poverty alleviation. There is no relocation of population. The
submergence areas of the dams and the unused land to be newly developed are
uninhabited.
24.       There are no natural forests, grasslands or wetlands in the project
areas, and thus wildlife resources are meager. The project will, however,
increase forest cover from 14 percent to 38 percent, and evidence from
recently developed areas suggests that this will lead to a higher and more
diverse population of birds and small mamals. The higher standards of crop
management will not lead to any increase ir. the runoff of fertilizers (herbi-
cides and insecticides are seldom used in field crops) since most of the crop
land will be terraced. The expansion of orchards will lead to some increase
iu pesticide use, but an objective of the project is to disseminate techniques
for safer and more efficient use of agricultural chemicals.
25.       Each of the provinces has prepared an Environmental Impact Assess-
ment (EIA) and a detailed Summary EIA for the Project hao been prepared under
the guidance of scientists from YRCC. This high quality report, prepared in
accordance with the Bank's format and guidelines for EIAs, finds the project
will have major ecological and social benefits, and contains detailed propos-
als fcr environmental management and monitoring. The report has been approved
by the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and was sent to IDA
prior to appraisal.
26.       Benefits.  The benefits will be substantial in three areas:
(a) Poverty Alleviation. Per capita incomes in the project area are
still below the poverty line ($35 per year) and nearly 30 percent of
the population is illiterate or semi-literate. The project attacks
povorty at its core, as virtually no sources of income other than
from agriculture are within reach for the 1.2 million people in the
project area. Incomes would be more than doubled from Y 360 to
Y 900 as has been demonstrated in many villages where comprehensive
control measures were implemented.
(b)  Environment.  Large parts of the project area are severely degraded
aud current agricultural practices are unsustainable. More than
100,000 ha of presently cultivated land will be taken out of produc-
tion and, together with an additional 300,000 ha of mainly waste-
land, planted witS a mix of local tree, shrub and grass species.
This will not only significantly reduce erosion, but also improve



- 7 -
the microclimate and reduce the flood risk in the now often desert-
like gullies. Improved livestock management will help to reduce the
pressure on the existing grassland areas.
(c) Downstream Benefits. Annual sediment discharge out of the project
area is now about 120 million tons.  After comprehensive treatwent
this would be reduced by half, contributing substantially to an
improved sediment regime of the Yellow River. Thisvill permit
avoidance of significant costs in terms of raising river dikes,
reduced reservoir lives, silted-up irrigation canals, opportunity
costs of millions of cubic meters of water needed to flush the sedi-
ment into the ocean, and ever increasing flood risk. The economic
rate of return is estimated at 19 percent,
27.       Risks.  The project is based on years of Chinese experience in soil
conservation and agriculture on the Loess Plateau. It is also based on the
analysis of the World Food Program Mlzhi Project in Shaanxi and the Bank-
financed component in Dingxi County, Gansu, which have been quite successful.
Organizationally, the project would be implemented by the same competent agen-
cies which have gained this successful experience in the past, and which have
effectively prepared the project. The project thus appears to have fiw fore-
seeable risks.
28.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SOR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
