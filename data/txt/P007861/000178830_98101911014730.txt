VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Human Resource Implications of the Development Strategy
1,.       Implementation of the Government's strategy for fostering economic
development through diversification and raising productivity in the agricul-
tural sector would require expansion of rural extension and training services
to provide farmers and technicians with new types of essential skills. Simi-
larly, exploitation of hydropower resources would require a wide range of
skilled manpower which the country has not previously trained: during the
first seven years of dam construction about 3,000 skilled workers, 1,100 fore-
men and 200 professionals would be needed. The number of managers, adminis-
trators, and professional and technical personnel employed to manage modern
sector enterprises also grew rapidly from 22,000 to 36,000 in the last 10
years; however, no proper training or consultancy services have been provided
for them, and the mortality rate of the enterprises has been notoriously high
at 25% per year, mostly due to management deficiencies.
2.        The significant technological changes associated with farm mechani-
zation, agro-industrial development and construction of the major hydro-
electric projects will require new relationships between education and employ-
ment. Although the Paraguayan labor force is basically literate (81%) the
content of education has not been closely related to the changing requirements
of the labor market.
3.        To attain the Government's target of 7-8% annual economic growth in
the coming decade, productivity per worker will have to rise at some 3% per
year, compared with 1.6% in the past decade. The number of graduates entering
the labor force annually would have to be greater than it is now by about 5,600
at the university level, 1,000 at the secondary level and 25,500 at the primary
level. A significant expansion of secondary and university education, with
support from multilateral and bilateral agencies, will meet most of the pro-
jected deficit at these levels by 1930. Future Government effort therefore
should concentrate on the primary level.
4.        Against this basic educational background, the public sector will
have to organize systematic and large-scale training programs to meet proj-
ected annual requirements for office and sales workers (5,400), agricultural-
ists (8,100) and skilled and semi-skilled workers (8,700) up to 1985. More-
over, a substantial number of workers would need upgrading or retraining to.
enhance their productivity and mobility as new job opportunities develop.
While open unemployment in Paraguay is low at 3% of the labor force, a recent
lLO study estimates 53% of the labor force affected by underemployment (equiv-
alent to 32% open unemployment). More than half of the 443,000 rural workers
are engaged in cultivating basic grains for only a few months of the year,
and a large proportion of the urban labor force comprises small-scale



proprietors, self-employed service workers and casual laborers. Although new
job opportunities have developed with the recent acceleration of economic
growth particularly in agriculture, agro-industry and construction, the under-
employed workers seriously lack the technical skills required for the jobs.
This shortage. of skilled labor would have an adverse impact on the effective
implementation of the various development projects.
5.        The priorities for human resource development over the coming
decade will therefore be: (a) organization of training programs to meet the
immediate manpower requirements of the actively developing economy (short-
term); (b) modernization of curricula at all levels of education and training
to improve the response of graduates to rapid technological change (medium-
term); and (c) expansion of basic education opportunities in order to develop
a trainable and adaptable labor force (long-term).
Overview of the Formal Education System
6.        The formal education and training system of Paraguay is handicapped
by structural imbalances and qualitative deficiencies. The Government has
consistently underspent on education which amounted to only 11% of total pub-
lic expenditures in 1974, or about US$10 per capita, which is low compared
with other countries at a similar per capita income level. Moreover, the im-
pact of Government spending in education is impaired by the low efficiency of
the system. High dropout and repetition rates are reflected by completion
rates of only 26% at the primary level and 41% at the secondary level. These
figures imply that roughly 40% of annual operating expenditures are spent on
those who fail to complete their studies within the expected period. Low
efficiency is particularly acute in rural areas due to incomplete primary
schools, lack of teaching materials, and the irrelevance of the curriculum.
In addition, many children in rural areas speak only Guarani and have diffi-
culty in adapting to teaching in Spanish. It is estimated that about two-
thirds of the 120,000 school-age children outside the education system are in
rural areas.
7.        Despite the low level of efficiency and relevancy of the system, the
Government is achieving important improvements through various projects under
execution. The basic objectives of the Government's education policy, set out
in the 1969-80 Education Development Plan, are to increase educational oppor-
tunities at the primary and secondary levels, and to improve the quality of
educational programs and adapt them to the needs of the expanding economy.
A reform in basic education (grades 1 to 9), assisted by a USAID loan, is
presently being implemented and consists of curriculum development, textbook
production and the construction of pilot primary schools, regional centers
and teacher training facilities. At the secondary level, the structure and
content of education is being reformed through the first IDA education project
(Credit 347-PA). The multilateral school concept is being introduced to offer
practical options at the lower secondary level and technical courses at the
senior level. Although the schools in this project are not operational yet,
the strategy being implemented should effect a major change in the relevance
of education at this level within the next few years. In addition, IDB is



- iii -
participating in the development of secondary agricultural education and,
together with the IDA project, output from job-oriented courses will more
than double. The problems to be addressed in the area of vocational training,
which is the subject of the proposed loan, and the efforts under way to deal
with them are discussed in the following paragraphs.
National Vocational Training Service (SNPP)
8.        The Government's policy toward the education sector emphasizes the
development of vocational training for both urban and rural populations in
order to meet the expected demand for qualified manpower in the growing sec-
tors of the economy. A three-stage, ten-year plan for the development of
vocational training was prepared by the Ministry of Justice and Labor in 1970,
with Spanish technical assistance, to improve the availability of qualified
manpower. The plan aimed at establishing a national infrastructure for
vocational training through the construction of strategically located regional
centers from which mobile action would be organized. The Servicio Nacional de
Promocion Profesional (SNPP) was established in 1971 to organize vocational
training programs in all sectors. SNPP is a semi-autonomous body financed by
a 1% payroll tax, governed by a board of directors consisting of representa-
tives of the Government, private enterprise, and the trade unions. The
chairman of the governing board is also director of SNPP and is appointed by
the Minister of Justice and Labor.
9.        The first stage of the plan was begun with the construction of a
pilot training center in Asuncion (170 places), the establishment of an
instructor training unit, and 13 mobile units which travel to all parts of
the country. Emphasis is on workers (over 18 years of age) in agricultural
and industrial occupations, but the separate needs of employed and unemployed
persons are not satisfied. Output in 1974 totalled 1,350 from courses varying
in duration from three to five months. Construction of a second vocational
training center at San Lorenzo started in 1975 with the erection of one
building for construction trades. Equipment for this center has been provided
under a technical assistance grant from the UK. SNPP is also receiving
technical assistance from Spain for agricultural training and from the UNDP/ILO
for the establishment of an in-plant training service oriented to the manpower
needs of the hydroelectric power projects, and for the development of a pilot
scheme in rural training.
10.       The implementation of SNPP's programs, however, has been adversely
affected by two financial conistraints: the inadequate level of the institu-
tion's-revenues and the procedure by which SNPP's annual budget and monthly
transfers are calculated. The size of SNPP's annual budget is determined by
the collecting agencies (Social Security Institute, and the Retirement and
Pension.Fund of Bank Employees) which estimate the revenues accruing from the
payroll tax.  These revenues have been repeatedly underestimated.  Further-
iaore, due to the time-lag in the collection of the tax revenues from the
employers, the collecting agencies have transferred funds to SNPP based on



- iv -
rough estimates which fluctuate from month to month. More realistic projec-
tions of SNPP's income and better administration procedures are needed in
order to facilitate the planning and implementation of the institution's work
program. Towards this end, the proposed project seeks to improve the budget-
ary allocation procedures of SNPP.
1H1.      Despite the budgetary difficulties, SNPP has made some progress in
the use of available resources.  The cost per trainee hour has continuously
declined since commencing operations and was at US$1.35 in 1974. In sharp
contrast to the formal education system where less than 1% of recurrent
expenditures are spent on materials and supplies, SNPP allocates about 40%
of its recurrent expenditures to these items. Capital expenditures, which
accounted for about 30% of SNPP's budget in 1975, are utilized mostly to
procure additional equipment for training. The practical orientation and
efficiency of SNPP's expenditure policy and training programs would be rein-
forced in the future through administrative improvements which form part of
the proposed project, aimed at reducing the cost per trainee-hour to US$0.67.
In this respect, the project will provide a short-term management consultant
to assist in carrying out measures to strengthen SNPP's staffing, management
and administration.
12.       Current SNPP strategy places increased emphasis on mobile action to
extend the training services at a lower cost to a broader segment of the popu-
lation in rural and urban areas. About 60% of SNPP's training activities
would be addressed to the needs of rural areas with training centers located
in the colonization region of Eje del Este (Credit 509-PA) and Eje del Norte
(UNDP assisted). Other centers would be located at the sites of the hydro-
power projects. Although the quality of trade training given by SNPP is satis-
factory, the range of courses is limited due to lack of equipment and facil-
ities and they are becoming unrelated to needs because of minimal communica-
tion with enterprises. Moreover, there is no management training scheme for
medium- and small-scale enterprises, and the in-plant training service is
limited to the needs of the Itaipu hydroelectric project. In order to effect-
ively meet the changing demands of the economy for trained manpower and in-
creased productivity, implementation of SNPP's training plan needs to be
accelerated, training techniques upgraded and output of trained workers sub-
stantially increased. The proposed project aims directly at overcoming the
obstacles facing SNPP in these areas.
13.       The proposed expansion of SNPP's training activities is a practical
and cost-effective effort to respond to the expected manpower requirments of
the economy. SNPP is a young organization with limitations in its structure
and management. Its viability depends mainly on developing an appropriate
organizational infrastructure which is consonant with the present management
capability. The strategy of establishing only a few small fixed centers in
key areas of economic activity and relying on mobile training would provide
the needed flexibility in meeting training needs and would not put undue
strain on the management.



Bank Group's Role in Education
14.       The basic objective of Bank Group lending to the education sector
in Paraguay is to support the Government's efforts to expand the availability
of formal and nonformal education throughout the country and to improve its
quality by making it more relevant to the manpower requirements of the economy.
The first Bank Group education project (Credit No. 347-PA) is a key component
of Paraguay's overall educational reform program and. was designed to assist
the Government in developing a more effective system of secondary and voca-
tional education. Implementation of the project is proceeding satisfactorily
and the schools will be functional by 1977. The proposed project represents a
continuation of the Bank Group's efforts in the sector and is designed to meet
Paraguay's urgent need for nonformal vocational training programs throughout
the country.
The Project
15.       Initial discussions by the Government on the possible composition
of a Vocational Training Project were held with a Bank reconnaissance mission
in August/September 1975. Preparation/appraisal of the project, with ILO
assistance, was completed in October/November 1975 and negotiations were held
in Washington from April 6 to 7, 1976. The Paraguayan delegation was led by
Dr. Carlos Chavez, Undersecretary of Finance.
9Oiectives and Content
16.       The proposed project would increase the vocational training capacity
of SNPP fourfold and thereby respond to the urgent training needs of the econ-
omy for skilled and managerial workers. It would provide SNPP with physical
facilities necessary to establish a national infrastructure, extend mobile
training action, strengthen the advisory services to enterprises and introduce
management training. Emphasis would be givea to accelerated training for
ruiral youth, as well as in-plant training and management training. Specific-
ally, the project comprises:
(a) expansion (construction, furnishing and equipping) of
vocational training centers in Asuncion and San Lorenzo,
increasing the existing capacity from 205 to 545 trainee
places;
(b) construction of four new vocational training centers in
Hernandarias (Itaipu), Encarnacion (Yacyreta), Chore and
Coronel Oviedo providing 495 trainee places;
(c)  two mobile .raining workshops aLid 24 sets of equipment and
transport for about 1,500 trainees; and
(d) technical assistance comprising 10-1/2 man-years of expert
services and 5-1/2 man-years of fellowships.



- vi -
17.       The vocational training centers would operate on a two-shift basis
with accelerated training for the unemployed in the mornings and upgrading
training for employed workers in the afternoons. All centers would, in
addition, serve as administrative bases for the mobile training units, which
would circulate to towns and villages too small to justify a fixed center.
The proposed facilities would permit training to be carried out in 38 differ-
ent occupations in the industrial, agricultural and services sectors, as well
as provide overall management training. Taking into account the different
needs of trainees attending the upgrading and accelerated courses, the Govern-
ment gave assurances to the Bank that within one year of loan signing accele-
rated training courses would be organized separately from upgrading courses.
18.       All training would be based on occupational analysis and flexibility
would be ensured through the use of short self-contained training modules.
National training standards would be established for recognized skilled occu-
pations, trade testing carried out and certificates awarded. Assurances were
obtained from the Government that within one year of loan signing the afore-
mentioned techniques would be introduced and closer coordination with employers
would be established.
19.       A placement service for the trainees, a tracer system to follow-up
their career development, and evaluation procedures to assess the suitability
and effectiveness of the training programs would be established on a permanent
basis. The Government, with the assistance of the US Economic Mission, has
already initiated a pilot project for the establishment of a tracer system.
Assurances were obtained from the Government that within one year of loan sign-
ing the tracer system, and the evaluation procedures would be made operational
on a permanent basis.
20.       The in-plant training service initiated with UNDP/ILO assistance
to train personnel for the hydropower scheme would be expanded to a national
service under the project. Technical assistance would thus be included in
the project to assist SNPP to provide a service to help enterprises diagnose
training needs and implement on-the-job training programs.
21.       The project would expand the existing mobile training program by
providing two mobile agro-mechanics and carpentry workshops for courses in
the larger communities and 24 sets of equipment and transport for training
in 13 rural oriented specialties in less accessible regions.
22.       A management consulting and training unit would be established as
a separate division of SNPP but under the control of its Governing Council.
It would be charged with two principal functions. The first, aimed at the
modern sector would be carried out mostly in Asuncion concentrating mainly in
the field of industrial engineering. Implementation would be by seminars
and courses with follow up consulting visits to enterprises. The second
would be to train small businessmen in the interior of Paraguay. The manage-
ment consulting and training unit would organize courses for SNPP instructors



- vii -
of the centers and mobile units, who would in turn include elementary
management courses in their programs. To ensure continued relevancy of the
management unit's activities, the Government assured the Bank that the man-
gement program would be evaluated annually in consultation with employers
associations.
23.       To operate the centers and mobile units, an additional 65 instruc-
tors, 5 supervisors, and 6 management trainers would be required. Instructor
trainees would be recruited from amongst former graduates of the formal voca-
tional and agricultural schools who have adequate practical experience and
trained in instructing techniques by the SNPP's own instructor training unit.
Supervisors would be selected from existing instructors and sent abroad for
training in the organization of training centers, vocational training plan-
ning and evaluation techniques. Personnel to form the management consulting
and training unit would be sought amongst engineers in various fields and sent
abroad to receive training in industrial engineering and management techniques.
24.       The project technical assistance is designed to supplement assis-
tance being provided by other bilateral and multilateral agencies. It
comprises (a) 6 1/2 man-years of specialist services and 3 man-years of
fellowships to assist the SNPP in establishing the management consulting and
training unit; (b) 3 man-years o specialist services to promote the in-plant
training program on a national basis; (c) 2-1/2 man-years of fellowships to
train the supervisors of the regional vocational training centers; and (d) 1
man-year of specialist services to assist in reorganizing SNPP's management
system and to expedite the preparation of equipment lists for the project
during the start-up period. The cost of technical assistance is estimated at
US$45,000 per man-year of specialist services and US$18,000 per man-year of
fellowship.
Project Cost and Financing
25.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$5.7 million, in-
cluding physical contingencies of US$0.4 million and price contingencies of
US$1.0 million. The proposed Bank Loan of US$4.0 million would finance about
70% of the total project cost, covering all of the foreign exchange cost of
US$3.05 million and US$0.95 million of the local currency cost of US$2.65 mil-
lion. Local cost financing of this order is justified on country grounds.
The balance of the project costs, estimated at US$1.7 million, would be pro-
vided by the Central Government Budget.
26.  --  Since the operation of SNPP will substantially expand with this
project in terms of both the number of trainees and types of programs offered,
the recurrent expenditure will triple in five years. With the present cash
flow, SNPP would enter into deficit in 1978. By 1980, when the project is
fully operational, recurrent costs would reach US$1.6 million, while income
derived from the payroll tax would amount to only US$1.1 million. Therefore,
assurances were obtained from the Government that it would take the steps
necessary to increase the funds available to SNPP in such amounts as shall be
necessary for the efficient operation of the training programs.

Implementation
27.       The Director of SNPP would be responsible for the overall adminis-
tration of the project. He would be assisted by four full-time project staff:
an experienced administrator, an architect, a procurement specialist and an
accountant, all appointed in consultation with the Bank. During the start-up
period, it would be necessary to strengthen the project staff; short-term con-
sultants in management and on equipment specifications are therefore provided
under the project. Appointment of the project staff would be a condition of
effectiveness of the loan.
28.       Sites for five of the six project centers have been identified.
Although the locations are suitable, some sites are small. No major problems
are anticipated with regard to the acquisition of more land adjacent to the
present sites. Assurances were obtained from the government that, in principle,
any remaining sites still to be identified would be selected in accordance
with criteria acceptable to the Bank.
29.       Architectural design work for the vocational training centers would
be assigned to consultant firms acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were ob-
tained that the project staff supported as necessary by other technical staff
of SNPP would review the architectural designs and equipment and furniture
lists and, before submission to the Bank, the Director of SNPP would certify
that they meet economic and functicnal standards and costs and the educational
objectives of the project.
30.       Finally, to monitor the performance of the project and to evaluate
its effectiveness, the Government has undertaken to complete a preliminary
assessment of the results and experience gained during implementation within
three months of the Closing Date of the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
31.       Contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of compe-
titive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Since the civil works are of small size (averaging
US$320,000) and at scattered locations, foreign contractors are not expected
to participate but they would not be precluded from bidding. Contracts for
the procurement of furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines
except that furniture and equipment that cannot be grouped into packages of
at least US$15,000 or more would be procured on the basis of local procedures
acceptable to the Bank. Procurement under these procedures would not in aggre-
gate exceed US$145,000 (corresponding to about 10% of the total cost of furni-
ture and equipment).  Domestic furniture and equipment manufacturers tendering
under international competitive bidding procedures would be allowed a pre-
ferential margin equal to the prevailing tariff or 15% of the c.i.f. cost of
competitive imports, whichever is lower.



- ix -
32.       Adequate allocation of funds for both maintenance of facilities as
well as replacement of used materials would be required. The Government gave
assurances that SNPP would adequately maintain and repair the buildings,
furniture and equipment provided under the project.
33.       The proposed loan would be. disbursed over a period of four years.
Retroactive financing not exceeding US$50,000 is proposed for expenditures
made after January 1, 1976 to cover the starting up costs for timely execu-
tion of the project. The financing would include expenses for professional
services, site development, technical assistance and project administration.
Conclusions
34.       The expansion of Paraguay's vocational training program through the
proposed project is expected to yield significant benefits for various key
sectors of the economy, as well as to help improve the country's income dis-
tribution. The project would contribute to reducing the critical shortage of
manpower for development projects, particularly in the agricultural and power
sectors, and also help increase the managerial capacity of the country, which
Is considered to be a major bottleneck for the growth of the industrial sector.
,At full development of the project by 1980-85, the annual output of SNPP
trainees, is expected to almost quadruple, and around 450 persons would receive
managerial training annually. With regard to the education sector, the proj-
ect *o'uld promote greater relevancy of education to the overall needs of the
economy by strengthening SNPP, which is the major institution for non-formal
vocational training in Paraguay. Finally, the project would help increase
.the employment and earnings opportunities among the lowest groups on the in-
come scale, including underemployed rural youth and the urban unemployed.
By training and retraining workers in the rural areas, where colonization
schemes are underway, the project would contribute to meeting the Government's
objective of doubling rural family income within 10 years.
35.       Although SNPP has improved its use of available resources, it is a
young organization with limitations in its structure and management. Steps
would be taken through the proposed project to strengthen its organization and
management by providing technical assistance, and by relying on only a few
fixed training centers and several mobile training units. This strategy would
provide the needed flexibility in meeting training needs without putting undue
strain on the management. Special provision has also been made under the
project for the Government to evaluate annually SNPP's activities to ensure
their efficiency and relevancy. Another difficulty that SNPP has faced in the
past has been related to the provision of adequate and timely funds for its
operations. As noted earlier, assurances have been obtained from the Govern-
ment that it would take the steps necessary to increase the funds available
to SNPP in such amounts as shall be necessary. In particular, agreement was
reached with the Government on the annual allocation of funds that would be
made available-to SNPP to ensure the efficient implementation of its
activities.

Recommendations
36.       The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$4 million (Third Window Funds) to the Government of Paraguay for a term
of 25 years including a 7-year period of grace.



I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HUMAN RESOURCES
ISSUES AND STRATEGY
Economic Development
1.01      Although Paraguay is one of the poorest Latin American countries,
with a per capita annual income of only US$320 (1972), development prospects
over the medium- and longer-term are promising through intensive exploitation
of the country's comparative advantage in agriculture and agro-industries and
its vast hydropower resources. Agriculture has been the mainstay of the
economy, accounting in 1974 for about one-third of GDP, 90% of export earnings
and more than half of all employment. The manufacturing sector, which employs
another 15% of the labor force, is predominated by related agricultural pro-
cessing industries such as food, wood and calk, textiles and leather products.
There exists considerable potential for future growth based on extensive areas
of underutilized fertile land suitable for agriculture, livestock and forestry:
the land:man ratio is twice as high as in the rest of Latin America, and only
12% of arable land has so far been brought under cultivation. The eastern
region of the country, with 40% of the land area, contains 97% of the 2.4
million population, densely settled within a 100 km radius of Asuncion on
farm units half of which hold 5 ha of land or less.
1.02      Agricultural production expanded at an annual rate of 9% in both
1973 and 1974. Such marked increases in output have derived more from expan-
sion of arable land than from productivity improvement. Since 1960, through
land reclamation and colonization, about 300 colonies comprising nearly
900,000 ha have been established and this has benefited one out of every
four agricultural workers. However, the living standards in these colonies
remain low, as the much needed public support services such as credit, housing,
extension, health and education-have been inadequate. Extension services, for
example, cover only 12% of total farm units and few educational facilities
and skill training opportunities are available.
1.03      For the future, the Government plans to reinforce its programs for
diversification of export crops and import substitution and to raise produc-
tivity on small and medium-size farms. Extension of public support services
to the colonization areas will be strengthened, with geographic emphasis on
the northern axis linking Asuncion with Hernandarias ("Eje del Norte" region)
and the eastern axis joining Chore and Encarnacion ("Eje del Este" region).
This strategy would raise rural earnings and thereby also have a favorable
impact on income-distribution in Paraguay. Presently, about two-thirds of
the total population lives in rural areas and it has been estimated that the
average rural income (US$200 per capita in 1973) is equivalent to only 28%
of that in cities and towns.
1.04  .   In addition to agriculture, exploitation of hydropower resources
through construction of two large projects jointly with Argentina and Brazil
will provide a plentiful source of energy and foreign exchange earnings.
Construction of the Itaipu, Yacyreta and Corpus dams will be a source of
growth in themselves, as well as have multiplicative effects on the regional



-2-
economies. Given the proximity of the dams to large colonization zones, the
Government will develop agro-industries and attract energy-intensive indus-
tries to these areas.
Human Resources
1.05      Implementation of the Government's strategy for fostering economic
development through diversification and raising productivity in the agricul-
tural sector would require expansion of rural extension and training services
to provide farmers and technicians with new types of essential skills. For
instance, while in 1962 only one in every 1,600 agricultural workers was
engaged in tractor or truck driving, the comparable figure in 1974 was one in
every 60. Similarly, exploitation of hydropower resources would require a
wide range of skilled manpower which the country has not previously trained:
during the first seven years of dam construction, 3,000 skilled workers, 1,100
foremen and 200 professionals would be needed at both Hernandarias and
Encarnacion. The number of managers, administrators, and professional and
technical personnel employed to manage modern sector enterprises also grew
rapidly from 22,000 to 36,000 in the last 10 years, two-thirds of whom reside
in the vicinity of Asuncion; however, no proper training or consultancy ser-
vices have been provided for them, and the mortality rate of the enterprises
has been notoriously high at 25% per year, mostly due to management defi-
ciencies.
1.06      The significant technological changes associated with farm mechani-
zation, agro-industrial development and construction of the major hydroelec-
tric projects will require new relationships between education and employment.
Although the Paraguayan labor force is basically literate (81%), present
educational atainments are relatively low: only 31% completed six years of
primary education, some 7% secondary and 1.4% higher education. The educa-
tional profile deteriorates sharply in the agricultural sector, where little
more than 10% of the labor force completed primary and less than 1% secondary
education. Moreover, the content of education has not been closely related to
the changing requirements of the labor market.
1.07      To attain the Government's target of 7-8% annual economic growth in
the coming decade, productivity per worker will have to rise at some 3% per
year, compared with 1.6% in the past decade. The number of graduates enter-
ing the labor force annually would have to be greater than it is now by about
5,600 at the university level, 1,000 at the secondary level and 25,500 at the
primary level (Annex I-1). A significant expansion of secondary and univer-
sity education, with support from multilateral and bilateral agencies, will,
meet most of the projected deficit at these levels by 1980. Future Govern-
ment effort therefore should concentrate on the primary level.
1.08      Against this basic educational background, the public sector will
have to organize systematic and large-scale training programs to meet proj-
ected annual requirements for office and sales workers (5,400), agricultural-
ists (8,100) and skilled and semi-skilled workers (8,700). Moreover, a



-3-
substantial number of workers would need upgrading or retraining to enhance
their productivity and mobility as new job opportunities develop. While open
unemployment in Paraguay is low at 3% of the labor force, a recent ILO study
estimates 53% of the labor force affected by underemployment (equivalent to
32% open unemployment). More than half of the 443,000 rural workers are
engaged in cultivating basic grains for only a few months of the year, and a
large proportion of the urban labor force comprises small-scale proprietors,
self-employed service workers and casual laborers. Although new job oppor-
tunities have developed with the recent acceleration of economic growth
particularly in agriculture, agro-industry and construction, the underemployed
workers seriously lack the technical skills required for the jobs. As the
increase in demand for skilled labor has exceeded the supply, wages particu-
larly in the rural areas have climbed sharply. This rapid rise in wage rates
would have an adverse impact on the effective implementation of the various
development projects and on the competitiveness of Paraguayan exports.
1.09      The priorities for human resource development over the coming
decade will therefore be: (a) organization of training programs to meet the
immediate manpower requirements of the actively developing economy (short-
term); (b) modernization of curricula at all levels of education and training
to improve the response of graduates to rapid technological change (medium-
term); and (c) expansion of basic education opportunities in order to develop
a trainable and adaptable labor force (long-term).

II. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
An Overview of the Formal System
2.01      The  Paraguayan education system comprises four levels:  pre-
primary, primary, secondary and higher, with the Ministry of Education res-
ponsible for all education except higher education and certain specialized
schools (Annex II-1). The system is handicapped by structural imbalances
and qualitative deficiencies. The government has consistently underspent on
education which accounted for slightly less than 11% of total public expend-
itures in 1974, or about US$10 per capita, which is equivalent to only half
the average level of other Latin American countries (Annex II-2). Moreover,
the impact of Government spending is impaired by the low efficiency of the
education system, reflected in completion rates of only 26% at the pri-
mary and 41% at the secondary level. These figures imply that roughly 40%
of annual operating expenditures are "lost" on those who drop out or fail
to complete their studies within the expected period. Low efficiency is
particularly acute in rural acres due to incomplete primary schools (more
than half offer less than six years of schooling), language problems (most
rural children speak Guarani while the language of instruction is Spanish),
low teachers' salaries (estimated to be less than the agricultural wage rate
in many areas), irrelevant curricula and lack of teaching materials. Despite
these deficiencies, a momentun towards change has been developing recently
through various projects under preparation or in execution. The basic ob-
jectives of the Government's present education policy, set out in the 1969-80
Education Development Plan, are to increase educational opportunities at the
primary and secondary levels and to improve the quality of educational prog-
rams and better relate them to the needs of the expanding economy.
2.02      A reform of basic education (grades 1 through 9) was launched with
USAID assistance, in curriculum development, textbook production and the con-
struction of pilot primary schools, regional centers and teacher training
facilities. UNDP/UNESCO is assisting in the area of teacher training. Also,
a possible third Bank Group education project is under preparation to help the
Government in expanding opportunities for communities in selected low-income
regions where complementary economic development programs are being executed.
2.03      At the secondary level, education has not been particularly respon-
sive to the demand of the economy: in 1974 only 425 students graduated from
post-primary trade training programs and 772 from upper secondary technician-
level courses, with 88% of the latter in commercial occupations. The struc-
ture and"content of secondary education is being reformed through the first
IDA education project (Credit 347-PA) by the introduction of the multilateral
school concept in 7 new schools which are expected to begin operations in 1977.
In additton, the IDB is assisting in the field of agricultural education. The
combined effect of these two projects will be to increase output by 1980 to
over 1,000 graduates at the trades level and about 1,800 at the technician
level. The proportion of commercial graduates would be reduced to about 58%
of the total.



-6-
2.04      Higher education is largely oriented towards conventional speciali-
zations in the humanities and some sciences. Courses in management science
and accountancy are offered in both the Catholic University and the National
University; the annual output is only about 50 graduates and the approach is
traditional with emphasis on financial accounting, business law and office
administration. Since there are no industrial engineering programs, gra'duates
are poorly prepared to foster improvements in productivity through modern man-
agement.
Non-Formal Education and Training
2.05      The Government's policy towards the education sector also emphasizes
the development of vocational training for both the urban and rural popula-
tions, in order to meet the expected demand for qualified manpower which will
be generated in the near- and medium-term by the development of the country's
hydropower potential and by the agricultural mechanization process accompany-
ing large-scale official rural development and colonization programs. The
Servicio Nacional de Promocion Profesional (SNNP), established in 1971, pro-
vides the widest range of occupationally oriented training and will serve as
the principal instrument through which the government will implement its plans
for expanding training opportunities (Chapters III and IV, below).  Also note-
worthy are the efforts of two public enterprises, the Administracion Nacional
de Telecommunicaciones (ANTELCO) and the Administracion Nacional de Electrici-
dad (ANDE), which operate in-plant training courses of from several days to
three years' duration, with a combined output of 750 in 1974. The Instituto
Paraguayo de Capacitacion Empresarial, established in October 1975, offers
evening courses of from 15 to 150 hours' duration in management training. Al-
though initial courses have been well supported, lack of financial resourses
and proper organizational structure will prevent any significant growth of the
Instituto's capacity. Finally, various small-scale programs are offered in
literacy, adult education, sports and crafts for girls, sponsored by the Govern-
ment and a few private cultural entities.
Bank Group's Role in Education and Training
2.06      The basic objective of Bank Group lending to the education sector in
Paraguay is to support the Government's efforts to expand the availability of
formal and nonformal education throughout the country and to improve its quality
by making it more relevant to the manpower requirements of the economy. The
first Bank Group education project (Credit No. 347-PA) is a key component of
Paraguay's overall educational reform program and was designed to assist the
Government in developing a more effective system of secondary and vocational
education. The proposed project represents a continuation of the Bank Group's
efforts in the sector and is designed to meet Paraguay's urgent need for non-
formal vocational training programs throughout the country.

III. NATIONAL VOCATIONAL TRAINING SERVICE (SNPP)
Background
3.01      In 1970, with Spanish technical assistance, the Ministry of Justice
and Labor prepared a ten-year vocational training plan to increase the avail-
ability of qualified manpower in Paraguay. The plan provided for the estab-
lishment of a network of strategically located regional centers, from which
mobile training programs could be organized to reach the more scattered rural
population. The institutional framework for implementing the plan was created
in 1971, when the Servicio Nacional de Promocion Profesional (SNPP) was estab-
lished to offer vocational training in all sectors. The proposed project, for
which Bank loan has been recommended, is designed to improve and expand the
training capacity of the SNPP (Chapter IV).
3.02      The SNPP is a semi-autonomous body which is financed by a one per-
cent payroll tax and governed by a tripartite Board of Directors comprising
employers, labor, and government representatives. The Chairman of the Board,
who is also SNPP's operational director, is appointed by the Minister of Labor.
At present SNPP's activities are concentrated in a pilot training center (170
trainee places) in Asuncion, with 13 mobile units serving other parts of the
country. The emphasis is on adult (over 18 years of age) training, including
upgrading programs for the already employed and accelerated training for new
workers. Output in 1974 totalled 1,350 from courses varying from three to five
months' duration and chosen on the basis of training needs identified by the
Human Resource Department of the Ministry of Labor. Construction of a second
vocational training center at San Lorenzo started in 1975 with the erection
of one building for the construction trades. Equipment has been provided
through British technical assistance. SNPP is also receiving technical assis-
tance from Spain for agricultural training and from the UNDP/ILO for the
establishment of an in-plant training service for the Itaipu hydroelectric
project and for the development of a pilot rural training scheme at Chore.
3.03      Implementation of the national vocational training plan has fallen
far behind schedule due to financial resource constraints (para 3.04), exacer-
bated by understaffing, lack of proper organization and accounting procedures.
Moreover, although the quality of SNPP training is satisfactory, the range of
courses offered is limited because of inadequate equipment and facilities and
the different requirements of employed workers and new entrants to the labor
force are not catered for separately. Furthermore, there is no management
training program for medium- and small-scale enterprises and only a very
limited in-plant training service at the Itaipu hydroelectric project. Poor
coordination with the employers and the Ministries of Education and Agricul-
ture has constrained the develoment of relevant courses and the cptiLum use
of available physical facilities. The situation has been further aggravated
by the limited application of job analysis techniques and skill testing and
certification.



- 11 
Finance
3.04      Implementation of SNPP's programs has been adversely affected by
two financial problems: the absolute level of the institution's revenues
has been inadequate, and the procedure by which SNPP's annual budget and
monthly transfers are calculated makes any effort at efficient forward
planning and programming extremely difficult.
3.05      The law establishing SNPP provides for budgetary allocations from
the Government and donations from other sources, as well as a one percent
tax levied monthly on wages and salaries actually paid by private employers.
In practice, SNPP receives only the tax revenue, which is collected by the
Social Security System (IPS) and the Retirement and Pension Fund of Bank
Employees (CJPED). Since total wages and salaries covered by the Social
Security System account for 16-18% of all national remunerations and certain
categories of workers such as teachers and domestic employees are exempted
from the tax, effective receipts by SNPP amount to only 0.84% of wages and
salaries covered by IPS and 0.14% of total national remunerations.
3.06      The basis of SNPP's annual budget has been the IPS and CJPED's
projections of revenue receipts from the payroll tax, which they have con-
sistently underestimated. In turn, monthly transfers to SNPP are based on
rough estimates of likely collections, and besides being underestimated they
fluctuate from month to month. Hence, a pattern has developed of an irregu-
lar cash flow throughout the year, followed by a large, but unpredicatable,
readjustment payment.
3.07      Despite these budgetary difficulties, SNPP has been improving its
efficiency in the use of available resources. Since commencing operations,
costs per trainee-hour have declined and were at US$1.35 in 1974. In the
distribution of its recurrent resources, SNPP has rightly placed more emphasis
on materials and supplies (40%) and less on personnel services (56%) and over-
head (4%). This contrasts sharply with the formal education system, where
almost all recurrent expenditures are for personnel services. Capital expen-
ditures, which accounted for about 30' of SNPP's 1975 budget, were used mostly
to procure equipment.
Strategy for Future Development
3.08      The Government has assessed the strengths and weaknesses of SNPP and
plans to expand its training activities to respond to the most urgent demands
of the economy.  About 60% of SNPP's training efforts would address the needs
of the rural population, with continued emphasis on mobile action to extend
services at low costs to peasants particularly in areas where official rural
development or colonization programs are planned or in execution.
3.09      Implementation of the strategy would increase SNPP's output from the
1974 level of 1,350 to about 4,950 trainees in 1980. Four new fixed vocational
training centers would be established: one each at Hernandarias (Itaipu) and
Encarnacion (Yacyreta) to provide training for the hydroelectric and related



- 12 -
development schemes, and one each at Chore and Coronel Oviendo to train peas-
ants in the colonization projects of "Eje de Este" (Credit 509-PA) and "Eje del
Norte" (UNDP-assisted). In addition, the existing center at Asuncion would
be expanded to house a management consultancy and training unit (para 3.10),
and the new center at San Lorenzo would be extended to provide opportunities
in 11 more industrial trades identified to be in substantial demand by the
economy.
3.10      The Government intends to restructure SNPP's management system to
enable it to respond to the expanded training program. Qualitatively, various
techniques will be employed to reinforce the relevance and cost-effectiveness
of training programs, including better coordination with other national agen-
cies, increased use of job analysis as the basis for development of curricula
and expanded application of skill testing and certification (for which some
assistance is being received from UNDP/ILO). In terms of broadening the scope
of SNPP's activities, programs for on-the-job training and upgrading of
workers, an advisory service for enterprises in identifying training needs and
developing programs, and a management consultancy and training unit for up-
grading supervisors, managers and executives would be established.

IV. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The proposed project would assist the Government of Paraguay in
implementing its plans for the expansion of vocational training to meet the
short and medium term manpower requirements of the economy. The capacity of
the SNPP, the major national training institution, would be increased four-
fold with provision of training opportunities in both rural and urban areas
for out of school youths, employed and unemployed adults and executives. The
project would provide SNPP with the physical facilities necessary to estab-
lish a regional infrastructure, extend mobile training action, strengthen the
advisory services to enterprises and introduce management training.
Content
4.02      The project consists of:
(a)  construction, furnishing and equipping of four new and expansion
of two existing vocational training centers, as follows:

Total                       2     4         205    775  1,040
(b)  two mobile training workshops and 24 sets of equipment and
transport to provide anntial training opportunities for about
1,500 persons; and
(c)  technical assistance cumnprising 10 1/2 man-years of specialist
services and 5 1/2 haan-years of fellowships.
4.03-     With the exception of Chore 1/, the center would operate on a two-
shift basis with accelerated training for unemployed workers and dropouts from
the edtucation system in the mornings and upgrading of employed workers who
wiuU, Lo 'i,prove their skill qual4fications in the afternoons.  The Government
1/   -tore would offer a full-time pilot program for rural youths, to be
implemeated with UNDP/{LO assistance.

gave assurances that within one year of loan signing these two categories of
trainees would be separated. All centers would, serve as administrative bases
for the mobile training units which would circulate among towns and villages
too small to justify a fixed center. The duration of stay at each place would
vary from 4 to 24 weeks, with the itinerary determined by the regional center
and based on consultation between the instructors, agricultural extension
officers and community officials.
4.04      Between 1980 and 1985, average annual output from the SNPP system
would have increased to about 4,950, including mobile training activities
accounting for some 2,000, management training for 420 and in-plant schemes
about 500. A detailed training plan giving output for each region by occupa-
tion and method of training is included in the working papers. In all, about
one-fourth of total estimated requirements for trained agricultural workers
and skilled manpower in other sectors would be satisfied through SNPP. The
balance would be provided to some extent through technical and vocational
secondary school programs but, for the most part, through informal learning in
the course of employment,see table below.

4.05      The in-plant training service initiated with UNDP/ILO assistance to
train personnel for the hydropower scheme would be expanded to a national sys-
tem under the project. Technical assistance would thus be included in the
project to assist SNPP to provide a service to help enterprises diagnose train-
ing needs and implement on-the-job training programs.
4.06      The project would expand the existing mobile training program by
providing two mobile agro-mechanics and carpentry workshops for courses in the
larger communities and 24 sets of equipment and transport, for training in 13
rural oriented specialities in less accessible regions.
4.07      Courses varying in length from 60 to 800 hours would be offered in
38 different occupations in the industrial agricultural and services sector
and in management.  All training would be based on occupational analysis and
flexibility would be ensured through the use of short, self-contained inter-
connected training modules which would permit trainees to enter the system
at the point appropriate to their qualifications and return for further train-
ing at later stages, in their careers. National training standards would be
established for recognized skilled occupations, trade testing carried out and
certificates awarded. The Government gave assurances that within one year of
loan signing the aforementioned techniques would be introduced and closer
coordination with enterprises would be established.
4.08      The Government is receiving financial assistance from the US Economic
Mission to establish a pilot tracer system to follow up the career development
of SNPP graduates. The Government gave assurances that within one year of
loan signing the tracer system would be expanded.
4.09      A management consulting and training unit for enterprises would be
established as a separate division of SNPP, under the control of the Board of
Directors. There would be two principal activities. The first, aimed at the
modern sector enterprises located mostly in Asuncion, would be mainly in the
field of industrial engineering and would involve seminars and courses with
follow-up visits to enterprises. The second would be aimed at training small
businessmen in the interior of Paraguay. The management training unit would
organize courses for SNPP instructors of the regional centers and mobile units,
who would in turn include elementary management courses in their respective
programs. The Government gave assurances that the program would be evaluated
annually in consultation with the employers' associations.
4.10      Training Staff.  An additional 65 instructors, 5 supervisors, and
6 management trainers would be required to operate the regional centers and
mobile units. Instructor trainees wold be recruited from among graduates of
the formal vocational and agricultural secondary schools who have acquired
practical experience; they would be trained in instructing techniques by the
successful SNPP instructor training unit established in 1973 with technical
assistance from the Spanish Government. Supervisors would be selected from
among existing instructors and sent abroad for training in the organization
of training centers, vocational training planning and evaluation techniques.



- 16 -
Personnel for the management training unit would be sought among marine
engineers, sugar refinery engineers and the like, and sent abroad for train-
ing in industrial engineering. On their return to Paraguay, they would
receive on-the-job experience in consultancy working in close coordination
with technical assistance specialists.
Technical Assistance
4.11      The project technical assistance is designed to supplement assist-
ance being provided by other bilateral and multilateral agencies. It comp-
rises (a) 6 1/2 man-years of specialist services and 3 man-years of fellow-
ships to assist SNPP in establishing the management consulting and training
unit; (b) 3 man-years of specialist services to promote in-plant training
programs on a national basis; (c) 2 1/2 man-years of fellowships to train the
supervisors of the regional vocational training centers; and (d) 1 man-year of
specialist services to assist in reorganizing SNPP's management system and to
expedite the preparation of equipment lists for the project during the start-
up period. The cost of technical assistance is estimated at US$45,000 per
man-year of specialist serpvices and US$18,000 per man-year of fellowships.
A detailed program of the technical assistance is provided in Annex IV-1.

5.02      Base costs are in prices as of January 1, 1976.  Costs of civil works
are derived from recent contracts obtained from private enterprises and the
actual construction costs of first project schools (Credit 347-PA) which are
under construction. Average construction costs are estimated at US$168 per
saquare meter of gross floor area, assuming the use of local materials and ap-
propriate design and building standards. Equipment and furniture costs are
based on recent contracts. Capital costs per trainee would be economical, as
the centers would mostly be used on a double-shift basis (Annex V-2). Costs
of the project items are computed net of taxes except for civil works, for
which taxes are estimated at about 5% (US$140,000).
5.03      Contingency allowances have been added to the base cost estimates
for: (a) physical contingencies equal to 10% of base cost estimates for civil
works, furniture and equipment and 5% for technical assistance, and (b) expect-
ed price increases of 10% in 1976 and 11% per year during 1977-79, reflecting
the increasing demand on the construction industry by the hydropower and other
development projects. Total contingencies amount to US$1.4 million or 32% of
base cost estimates (Annex V-3).

5.04      The foreign exchange component of US$3.05 million (54%) was calcu-
lated on the basis of the experience in the first project as follows: con-
struction 28%, site development 23%, furniture 15%, equipment 95% and
technical assistance 92%.
Financial Plan
5.05      Capital Costs.  The total project cost of US$5.7 million would be
financed by a Bank loan of US$4.0 million and a Government budgetary contri-
bution of US$1.7 million, as follows:
Financing
Fiscal Year      Expenditure          Bank    Government
(US$'000)        (US$'000)   (US$'000)
1977             1,218               830           388
1978             2,044             1,445           599
1979             1,766             1,250           516
1980               673               475           198
Total    5,701             4,000          1,701
The Government gave assurances that it would make sufficient and timely bud-
getary allocations to meet the annual requirement for counterpart funds to
implement the project.
5.06      Recurrent Costs.  Under the proposed project, improved efficiency
in the management of the training courses and the emphasis on mobile training
would reduce the cost per trainee-hour from US$1.35 to US$0.75 for institu-
tional training and US$0.52 for mobile training (para 3.07) (Annex V-4).  How-
ever, the proposed project provides for a substantial expansion in terms of
the number of trainees and types of programs offered, and SNPP's recurent
expenditures will triple in five years.  With present flow of funds, SNPP
wouLd begin to exper_ience a deficit la 1978.  By 19,0 when the project is
fully operational, recurrent costs would reach US$1.6 million (Annex V-5),
while revenue from the payroll tax would amount to only US$1.1 million,
representing a 39% deficit on current account. The Government gave assur-
ances that it would take the steps necessary to increase the funds available
to SNPP in such amounts as shall be necessary for the efficient operation of
the training programs.

VI. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
Project Administration
6.01      The Director of SNPP would be responsible for overall project imple-
mentation. He would be assisted by full time project staff comprising an
experienced administrator, architect, procurement specialist and accountant,
all appointed in consultation with the Bank (Annex VI-1). Short-term consul-
tants to assist during the start up period in restructuring SNPP's management
system and the development of equipment specifications have been included
under the technical assistance component of the project (para. 4.02). The
salaries of the aforementioned project staff estimated at US$180,000 as well
as a sum of US$20,000 for procurement of office equipment and furniture have
been included in the total project cost. Appointment of the project staff
would be a condition of effectiveness of the Loan.
Project Implementation Schedule
6.02      To assist in the effective and timely execution of the proposed
project, a comprehensive implementation schedule has been prepared (Annex
VI-2). This schedule was discussed during negotiations and mutually agreed
upon as a project implementation and monitoring tool.
Professional and Technical Services
6.03      Architectural design work for the regional centers would be assigned
to consultant firms acceptable to thje Bank and on terms and conditions agree-
able to the Bank.  The Government gave assurances that the project staff
supported as necessary by other technical staff of SNPP would review the
architectural designs and equipment and furniture lists and specifications and
before submission to the Bank, the Director of SNPP would certify that they
meet economic and functional standards and costs and the educational object-
ives of the project.
Sites
6.04      Sites have been identified for five of the six project centers,
although the locations are suitable, some of the sites are small. No major
problems are anticipated with regard to the acquisition of more land adjacent
to the present sites. The government gave assurances that all sites would be
select-d in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement
6.05      Contracts for furnitu-re and equipment would be awarded on the
bas-s of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guilelines, except that furniture and equipment which cannot be grouped
in nackages of at least US$15,000 would be procured through local



- 26 -
procedures acceptable to the Bank. SuCh procurement would not exceed US$145,000
in the aggregate (corresponding to about 10% of the estimated total cost of
furniture and equipment). Domestic suppliers of furniture and equipment would
be allowed a preferential margin in bid evaluation equal to the prevailing
tariff or 15% of the c.i.f. cost of imports whichever is lower. Contracts for
civil works would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally in accordance with local procedures acceptable to the Bank. Since the
civil works are of small size (averaging US$320,000).and at scattered locations,
foreign contractors are not expected to participate in the bidding, although
they would not be precluded from doing so.
Maintenance
6.06      For the proper and effective maintenance and operation of the proj-
ect facilities, a maintenance handbook should be prepared and procedures
established by SNPP. Also, adequate allocation of funds for both maintenance
of facilities as well as replacement of used materials would be required.
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the government that SNPP
would adequately maintain and repair the buildings, furniture and equipment
provided under the project.
Disbursement
6.07      The proposed US$4.0 million loan, equivalent to 70% of total project
costs of US$5.7 million, would finance the full foreign exchange component of
US$3.05 million and US$0.95 million (37%) of local currency costs. Retroactive
financing not exceeding US$50,000 would be provided for expenditures incurred
from January 1, 1976 in respect of professional services, site development,
technical assistance and project administration.
6.08      The loan would be disbursed over a four-year period (Annex VI-3).
Disbursement would be made against 45% of total cost of civil works and pro-
fessional services, 50% of total cost of project administration, 100% of
foreign expenditure or 85% of the cost of locally produced equipment and
furniture and 100% of technical assistance cost. Any surplus funds remaining
would be used for priority items closely related to the original project
subject to the Bank's approval.

VII. BENEFITS, RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND EVALUATION
Project Benefit
7.01      The proposed project would':  (a) contribute to reducing the criti-
cal shortage of manpower required for development projects particularly in the
agricultural and power sectors by increasing the output of SNPP from about
1,350 trainees in 1974 to 4,950 trainees per annum during 1980/85; (b) help to
increase employment opportunities among the lowest groups on the income scale
of the country by training and re-training workers in the rural areas where
colonization schemes are underway, and support the Government's objectives to
double rural family income within 10 years; (c) help increase the managerial
capacity of the country which is considered to be a major bottleneck for the
growth of the industrial sector, by training between 400 and 500 persons
annually; (d) promote greater relevancy of education to the overall needs of
the economy by strengthening SNPP, which is the major institution established
for nonformal vocational training in Paraguay.
Risks and Uncertainties
7.02      The planned expansion of SNPP would be subject to two major risks.
The first relates to the possible inadequacy of funds to cover substantially
increasing recurrent costs, which would leave buildings and equipment provided
through the proposed project underutilized. Therefore, SNPP's annual recurrent
budget would need to be monitored carefully so that the government could take
corrective action as needed. The second refers to weaknesses in SNPP's man-
agement structure. Steps would be taken through the proposed project to
strengthen its organization and management by providing technical assistance
and by relying on only a few fixed centers and mobile units. Without putting
undue strain on management needed flexibility would be achieved.
7.03      Since the management consultancy and training programs would be
entirely new to Paraguay, responsiveness of the private sector to such servi-
ces and SNPP's capacity to provide them need to be monitored with caution.
Evaluation
7.04      Considering the flexible nature of SNPP's activities which are
identified, organized and executed according to the constantly changing needs
of different sectors and regions, no useful evaluation indicators could be
developed this far in advance. Nevertheless, because of the uncertainties
involved, the management consultancy and training program should be eva-
luated annually, and a continuous and permanent evaluation procedure would
be established to assess the suitability and effectiveness of SNPP's other
training programs. Assurances were obtained from the Government that
