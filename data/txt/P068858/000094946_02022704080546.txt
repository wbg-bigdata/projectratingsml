Wetlands Restoration and Pollution Reduction Project

I. INTRODUCTION
The Government of Bulgaria has received a GEF/World Bank project preparation grant (PDF B)
for the preparation of a Wetlands Restoration and Pollution Reduction Project in the Danube Re-
gion. Two wetland sites will be restored within this project: Persina Marshes on Belene Island
and Kalimok-Brushlen Marshes east of Tutrakan. Restoration is expected to result in enhanced
nutrient uptake in the wetlands ecosystems and thus purification of Danube waters, revival of
valuable biodiversity and increase of fish populations of local economic importance. Within the
project preparation grant, the Ministry of Environment and Water has delegated to HPC-Bulgaria
a technical study for the design of wetland restoration models, which should provide for the op-
timal achievement of the above benefits, carefully balanced against acceptable land use changes.
A draft report on proposed restoration options has been submitted by HPC-Bulgaria. The present
Environmental Impact Assessment study reviews these proposed restoration options; identifies
their positive and negative impacts; recommends the most acceptable options, their improve-
ment, as well as mitigation measures as necessary.
Importance of the project
In 1990-1991 there was established the Environmental Program for the Danube River Basin as a
"preemtive measure to prevent river Danube and Black Sea water pollution from reaching catas-
trophic proportions". It was initiated as a result of sustained co-ordination between the riparian
states, international organizations, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Global
Environmental Facility (GEF), the EU, international financial institutions and international and
local Danubian NGOs. Co-ordination of these governments and organizations is through the
Task Force, which oversees programs, decision making and implementation.
The aims of the program were set out as:
(i)   Reduce the impact of River Danube pollution on the Basin's ecosystem and the Black
Sea.
(ii)  Improve the availability and quality of water in the Danube River Basin.
(iii)  Established control of hazards resulting from accidental spills.
(iv)  Develop regional water management co-operation.
The United Nations development Program (UNDP) and GEF commissioned a major report
"Evaluation of Wetlands and Floodplain Areas in the Danube River Basin" as a part of the Da-
nube Pollution Reduction Program (PRP). This report, published in May 1999, provided the first
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the existing extent of natural floodplains in this in-
ternational river basin. The study found that out of a total historical floodplain area of 41,605
km2 only 7,845 kmi2 remained - a remarkable loss of over 80%. Based on this evaluation the re-
port recommended 17 wetland/floodplain sites for rehabilitation taking into account their eco-
logical importance, their nutrient removal capacity and their role in flood protection. Only two of
the sites fall within the Bulgarian sector and both have been selected for this project.
The project forms part of a national action plan for the conservation of wetlands and is of par-
ticular importance for two reasons. Firstly it represents the first government proposal to restore
former Bulgarian wetlands. Secondly, in addition to restoring the biodiversity of bird, fish and
plant life it should contribute to the natural self-cleaning capacity of the river by nutrient trap-
ping and pollution reduction and thus, in a small way, assist Bulgaria's national and international
commitments to reducing transboundary pollution of the river and the Black Sea.
Since this is the first project of its kind, it is particularly important that it should be well de-
signed, environmentally sound and socially acceptable so that it can function as a model for

similar developments in the future. In order to achieve this a sound management and monitoring
plan will be essential.
Wetlands provide habitats of great importance to wildlife, especially birds whose migrations fol-
low the river and which are dependent on marshes and reed beds for their breeding and resting-
places. Likewise, there are a number of fish species whose breeding success depends on such
wetlands. The importance of these wetlands cannot be overestimated - for example Belene Island
was at one time the most important breeding area for several now threatened species of birds
(Red List). Following draining of the wetlands by construction of dikes, drainage channels and
pumping stations in 1949 there began a steady decline in breeding colonies of birds. According
to the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (BSPB) in 1967 there were still a total of
around 10,000 breeding pairs but by 1980 this had declined to 1,000 and, by 1985 to fewer than
100 pairs. Since 1995 only a few non-breeding birds have been seen.
Finally, it should be emphasized that wetlands comprise unique and disappearing ecosystems
that contribute enormously to the biodiversity and richness of our environment. They are essen-
tial components of the migratory routes of many threatened species of birds providing resting-
places along their which are now becoming almost too far apart.
Background of wetlands restoration
The conservation and restoration of wetlands in Bulgaria is particularly important for the follow-
ing reasons:
(i)   The small number and area of natural wetlands preserved at present as a result of some
geographical and climatic characteristics of the country and most of all - due to targeted
human interventions in the natural systems;
(ii)  They are of vital importance to biodiversity and are particularly interesting from a scien-
tific point of view;
(iii) A considerable number of natural and biological resources are regenerated and preserved
in lakes and marshlands: fish, mussels, reed, curative mud, salts etc. The bottom sediments
contain valuable information about the vegetation which grew in the vicinity of wetlands
thousands of years ago;
(iv) Wetlands provide essential environmental services such as retention/reduction of nutrients
and respective decrease in water and sediments pollution, as well as groundwater recharge.
The restoration of wetlands in the short and long term has ecological, aesthetic and economic
benefits. Until recent years, wetlands in Bulgaria were considered wasted arable land, breeding
grounds for mosquitoes, sources of diseases, etc. The 1920s saw the first large-scale drying-up of
marshes. After World War lI the destruction of marshes, mostly the ones in the Danube river-
side, became a widespread phenomenon. Almost all marshes along the Bulgarian stretch of the
Danube were dried up with the exception of Srebuma, Maluk Preslavets and Garvan, as well as a
few wetlands, which failed to be drained, and continued to exist under deteriorated conditions.
The dykes built along the rivers prevented them from flooding and the regulation of riverbeds
destroyed almost all meanders that were of paramount importance to the flora and fauna. The
large-scale drainage activities resulted in the destruction of almost all Bulgarian wetlands.
The development of industry and the irrational use of water resources led to pollution of a large
part of water bodies. Sometimes excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides in farming in many
places in the country caused eutrophication of a number of water bodies and the Black Sea Ba-
sin.

As a result of all this the territory of Bulgaria contains few wetlands and moreover, there is, in
almost all of them, a serious anthropogenic impact.
The main outcome of the restoration of these wetlands will be greater biological diversity, espe-
cially of species of great conservation importance and larger fish populations. The significance
of marshes that can be flooded by the river to the reduction of the pollution of the Danube (de-
crease in nutrient load, etc.) will be another outcome.
Bulgaria has bound itself to international commitments to implement a number of ratified con-
ventions and international documents directly or indirectly related to the issue of wetland protec-
tion and restoration such as the Con1venttion1 on wetlands of internationial importanice especially
as waterfowl hahitat ('the Ramsar Convenition,), 1971; Convention on co-operation for the protec-
tion and sustainiable use of the Daniube river, 1994; Convention on the protection and use of
transboundary watercourses and internationial lakes (Helsinki, 1992); Colnvenltion between the
Governmilenit of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Governmenit ofRoniania oni enivirotinmental co-
operation, 1992; T7he 1992 Convention oni biological diversity; Convention on the conservation
of Europeani wildlife and niatural habitats ('the Bern Conventioni); Convenitioni oni the conserva-
tion of migratory species of wild animals ('the Bonn Convention,), 1979 (amenided 1985,1988);
Convenition concerninlg fishinlg in the Danube water, etc.
Bulgaria, as one of the riparian states alongside other states and international bodies, was instru-
mental in the setting up the Environmental Program for the Danube River Basin in 1990-91. An-
other interesting initiative was the work of the Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds (un-
der the aegis of BirdLife International) to identify 50 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) throughout
Bulgaria, of which 12 (including the project sites) are located along the Danube.
In recent years the Ministry of Environment and Water has been pursuing a reassessment policy
of priorities in terns of conservation of numerous unique natural sites thus contributing to Bul-
garia's joining the global process of adopting a new attitude towards nature, and ensuring its sus-
tainable development and enrichment.
With Bulgarian environmental legislation aligned to EU standards, a number of regulations have
been adopted in relation to environmental protection and the conservation of biological diversity.
A national action plan to preserve the most important wetlands in Bulgaria has been developed in
view of their international significance.

II. BACKGROUND
Research Team
The environmental assessment of the Wetland Restoration and Pollution Reduction Project was
carried out between June-September 2001 by the following team of experts:
1. Stela Liubenova Ivanova - licensed expert in environmental impact assessment
2. Miroslava Guneva Nikolova - licensed expert in environmental impact assessment
3. Siyka Vasileva Georgieva - licensed expert in environmental impact assessment
4. Stoyan Dobrev Mihov - ichthyologist
11.1. DANUBE RIVERSIDE AND ISLANDS
The Bulgarian bank of the Danubc is 471.45 km long (from the Timok River to the Silistra Bor-
der) and runs from the 374.2 to the 845.65 river km from the mouth of the Danube.
The bank is narrow and steep in many places. It is several kilometers wide in certain places and
flanks relatively large lowlands, which were periodically flooded. To prevent the lowlands from
being flooded by the high water level of the Danube, earth dykes were built.
Of all islands in the Danube, 57 are within Bulgarian territory covering a total area of 115 sq.
km. The largest one is the Belene Island (Persina). The Danube islands are elongated and con-
stantly changed by the dynamics of the water and sediments. They consist of sand and gravel
sediments and are related to the flood terrace of the Danube. Most of the islands are 1-2 m.
above the average water level of the river, some are 3 m. above this level, and the highest one is
Belene Island, which is 6 m. high.
11.1.1. LOCATION OF PROJECT AREAS
Belene Island is the largest Bulgarian island on the Danube and is 15-16.5 km. long. It is located
upstream from the town of Svishtov, between the 577 river km and 560.5 river km from the river
delta (the town of Sulina). The island divides the river into two arms - northern and southern,
where a number of smaller islands are located. The northern arm of the Danube is a navigation
route and is of great significance to international transport. The southern and narrower arm is
barred by a pontoon bridge, there is an underwater barrier, and that is why it is accessible only to
small boats and some bigger vessels.
The Tutrakan Marsh Lowland, herein referred to as Kalimok-Brushlen after the names of the two
most famous marshes in the past, is situated between the towns of Rousse and Tutrakan. The
most important area is the one between the village of Riahovo and the town of Tutrakan that is
bounded by the villages of Babovo, Brushlen, Tsar Samuil and Nova Cherna. This area is situ-
ated between the 458 river km and 434 river km of the Danube. It is 24-25 km long and occupies
an area of 3,500 ha.
11.1.2. LEGISLATIVE AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
The legal provisions regulating matters related to the management and structure of the territory
are set out in the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Bulgaria.
The Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria sets forth the general principles and obligation re-
lated to the environmental protection and conservation; maintenance of the ecological balance
nature; and reasonable use of the country's natural resources.

Bulgaria is in the process of transposing the European directives in its legislation. Most signifi-
cant are the EU Directives 79/409/EEC (on protection of birds) and 92/43/EEC (on habitats) di-
rectly related to the conservation and management of these wetlands.

11.2. PROPOSED ALTERNATIVES
The technical research for the project on the restoration of the wetlands of Belene Island and Ka-
limok-Brushlen was carried out by HPC - Sofia in collaboration with AQUATEST a.s. - Prague.
The two areas, which are the subject of this environmental impact assessment, are as follows:
# Belene Island, which is 15 km long. The wetland planned to be restored encompasses the
eastern part of the island and covers approximately 2,500 ha.
> Kalimok-Brushlen floodplain covers 3,500 ha. and is bounded by the Danube River in the
north, the road from the town of Rousse to the town of Tutrakan in the south, a country road
connecting the villages of Babovo and Riahovo in the west. In close proximity to the bounda-
ries of this second area are the villages of Riahovo, Babovo, Brushlen, Nova Cherna and the
town of Tutrakan.
Both wetlands have been drained in the past with the construction of drainage systems and dikes
along the Danube bank and the island of Belene. Due to the hydrogeological conditions of the
sites, parts of the wetlands continued to exist and have a high potential for restoration.
The lowest flood level scenario for the two areas is considered unacceptable in view of the small
flooded area. The highest flood level scenarios are believed to have an insufficient number of
days per annum in which there may be natural flooding at this maximum level (no reason for less
possibility for natural flooding to the mid levels), and most of all - due to the complex land use
and ownership of lands affected at this flooding level.
For Belene Island the selected flood level is 20.0 m, and for Kalimok-Brushlen Wetland - 14.0
m.
A number of possible options concerning restoration work to achieve the selected level have
been considered: five options for Belene Island and three options for Kalimok-Brushlen.
11.2.1. BELENE ISLAND
Alternative 1. If a level of 20.0 m is reached by a flood, the flood area will be 1,562 ha the aver-
age depth being 0.35 m. The total volume of water in the flooded areas in the periods of flooding

to level 20.0 m will be 4.96 million cubic meters and the water retention period will be 10-14
days.
Two sluices with adjacent inlet channels will be built in the Danube dyke for the water to enter
the water areas in the south of the island, at the 570.5 river km (item A of the appended diagram)
and at the 567.6 river km (item B).
The entire flood land will be drained via two outlets in the east of the island - an existing outlet
at the 561.5 river km (item D) and a new one at the 561.0 river km (item E). The sluices will
help regulate the water level in the wetlands.
Alternative 2. Alternative 2 suggests that the number of sluices built and their location is the
same as in Alternative 1 but the western boundary of the flood land will be an internal dyke.
Thus, the flood area will be 1,289 ha. with an average depth of 0.36 m, 4.66 million cubic meters
total volume of water in the periods of flooding to level 20.0 m, and a retention period of 10-14
days.
Alternative 3. Alternative 3 is analogous to Altemative 1, but the area will let water from the
north, instead of from the south and two sluices will be built for this purpose: at the 569.3 river
km (item F) and at the 567.2 river km (item G).
Alternative 4. Alternative 4 is analogous to Alternative 2 but the area will let water from the
north, instead of from the south and two sluices will be built for this purpose: at the 569.3 river
km (item F) and at the 567.2 river km (item G).
The four options include the destruction of the Persina-2 Draining Pumping Station (DPS).
Additional provision is made for the construction of a pumping station for the pumping of water
into the wetland during the periods of low Danube water levels, without specifying any technical
solutions: number of pumps, flow, workdays per year, etc.
Alternative 5. Alternative 5 is, in reality, a different scenario since the proposed flooding level
is 21 and not 20 m, as in the four alternatives described above. The flooded area would be
maximal (almost half of the island), and the western arable part of the island will be protected by
means of internal dykes.
11.2.2. KALIMOK-BRUSHLEN
Alternative 1. If a flood reaches the selected level of 14.0 m, the flood area will be 1,585 ha.
with an average depth of 0.32 m, 5.07 million cubic meters total volume of water and a retention
period of 14 days.
Water will enter the area that can be flooded via three sluices in the Danube dyke and will be fur-
ther regulated by two sluices in internal dykes.
* a sluice at the 451.75 river km (item A) - new;
* a sluice at the 448 river km (item B) - reconstruction of an existing sluice of Main Drain-
age Canal 1 (MDC-1) for DPS II;
* a sluice at the 442 river km (item C) - reconstruction of an existing channel to the inflow
channel for the destroyed pumping station which pumped water to the fisheries;
* a sluice in the internal dyke at item G;
* a sluice in the internal dyke at item F.
MDC-1 will be connected to MDC-2 so that MDC-l can cover the entire area.

Analytical Creative Groiup LTD
The flood land will be drained via a sluice at the 436 river km (item E) - reconstruction of an ex-
isting sluice for DPS III.
Alternative 2. Alternative 2 is based on Alternative 1 but water overflow is limited by protecting
dykes to the west and to the south.
If a flood reaches a level of 14.0 m, the flood area will be 1,044 ha. with an average depth of
0.42 m, 4.36 million cubic meters volume of water and a retention period of 10-14 days.
Alternative 3. This alternative suggests that 10 separate open water areas be created through the
deepening of existing low areas in the terrain, with a hydraulic connection among them. The sur-
face of each of these open water areas will be 13 to 75 ha. and water depth - 2-2.5 m. Water will
enter the deep areas via a lock at the 451.75 river km (item A) and will flow into the Danube at
the 436 river km (item E).
The existing draining pumping stations will be destroyed in all three options. It is indicated that
additional amount of water could be pumped but here, just as it was with Belene Island, no spe-
cific technical solution has been proposed.
We are generally in support of the two flooding levels, 20 m for the Belene Island and 14 km for
Kalimok Brushlen. Without being critical, we are of the opinion that the presented alternatives
are in a rather preliminary stage and are not adequately justified to merit solid preference. How-
ever, most acceptable from the point of view of the environment are alternative 4 (Belene island,
with the water of the Danube entering from the north and with inner protective dykes) and alter-
native 1 for Kalimok-Brushlen (because of the largest area for restoration, but it requires many
improvements of the technical project).

III. ANALYSIS OF CURRENT SITUATION. FORECAST AND ASSESSMENT OF
EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE PROJECT ON ENVIRONMENTAL COMPO-
NENTS
111.1. INFRASTRUCTURE
1I.1.1. ExISTING INFRASTRUCTURE
III.1.1.1. Belene Island
The land expected to be flooded is 538-2,440 ha. The following facilities were built on the pro-
ject territory under consideration:
* Protecting dykes in the Danube- the entire island has been dyked;
* A draining system, including Persina-2 Draining Pumping Station with two 250 kWt ver-
tical pumps and drainage canals;
* Farm buildings (Sheep farm);
* Access roads;
* External power supply;
* Drinking water source - a Ranney well.
In relation to the draining system of Belene Island we have only the data from the on-site inspec-
tion, which do not give a full picture of the buildings and equipment built.
111.1.1.2. Kalimok-Brushlen
The land expected to be flooded is 444-2,819 ha. The following facilities were built and operate
in the area that may be flooded in the future or are in close proximity to it:
* Protecting dykes in the Danube;
* Brushlen Irrigation and Drainage System (IDS);
* Water supply wells;
* Fish ponds;
* Pig farm;
* Roads;
* Power cables.
111.1.1.3. Protecting Dykes in the Danube
The area which is the object of this inquiry is protected against high water levels of the Danube
by the so-called "Danube dykes" from the village of Riahovo (15+545 river km) to the town of
Tutrakan (41+113 river km) downstream the Danube. The dykes were built in 1945-1950 and
protect 6,489.4 ha. of arable land and the adjacent villages and towns against being flooded.
The dykes have a trapezoidal section with the following basic elements:
* width of the dyke at the top - from 2.80 to 4.20 m.
* upstream batter - from 1:1.50 to 1:5.50;
* downstream batter - from 1:1.5 to 1:5.

Anah'tical Creative Grouip LTD
According to the data given by Irrigation Systems EAD - Rousse, the level of the dyke is 18.11
to 20.74 high.
Platforms were built in five places - the dykes are used as a road connection among the facilities
in Brushlen IDS.
Our observations and the talks with the local people have shown that the condition of the dykes
is not good, unlike that on Belene Island. They have been super-graded and repaired in some lo-
cations but are not properly maintained in general. Also, in and below the dykes there are many
holes of burrowing animals, mostly badgers, foxes, rodents etc. which increase the infiltration at
high river water. Presently we do not have detailed data to allow for accurate assessment of the
condition of the dykes and of the risk of floods. In any case, we need to fill the gaps in our
knowledge in order to recommend measures for strengthening and rehabilitation of the dykes in
this project area.
111.1.1.4. Brushlen IDS
Brushlen IDS unites two systems - irrigation and drainage one.
The drainage system consists of:
* Draining pumping stations (DPS): Riahovo DPS, DPS II-a, DPS II, - Kalimok DPS and
DPS III (Tutrakan);
* Main drainage canals (MDC): MDC - I and MDC -2;
* P - 1 Outlet Channel;
* Tarchila - 1 and Turchila-2 Drainage Canals;
* Collectors;
* Monitoring wells;
The origin of the underground water that is in the lowlands is:
* filtrated water from the Danube;
* infiltrated water from the rainfall in the lowlands.
Water infiltrates in the entire territory of the lowlands and there is filtrated water within a certain
distance from the Danube.
Riahovo IDS was built between the village of Riahovo and Babovo and was set into operation in
1969. It gets water from MDC - 1 and re-pumps it into the Danube at the 462 river km. It drains
around 840.4 ha. The pumping station has two 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,100 1/sec H=1.3 MPa N=160 kWt;
The pumps start operating at a maximum water level of 12.50 m and stop operating at a mini-
mum water level of 12.00 m.
IDS II-a was set into operation in 1952 and is designed to drain about 1,780.8 ha. It gets water
from MDC - 1 and re-pumps it into the Danube at the 458 river km. The pumping station has
three 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,000 1/sec H=1.3 MPa N=180 kWt;
The pumps used to start operating at a maximum water level of 14.65 m and stop at a minimum
water level of 12.00 m.

The pumping station was destroyed and has not been operational for 10 years. Part of the equip-
ment was saved and stored.
IDS II (Nova Cherna) was set into operation in 1950. It gets water from MDC - 1 and re-pumps
it into the Danube at the 448 river km. It drains around 1,463.6 ha. The pumping station has:
s two 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,000 I/sec H=1.3 MPa N=160 kWt;
- four Vero Mavag vertical pumps with the following performance:
* Q=750 1/sec   H=0.7 MPa N=60 kWt;
The vertical pumps are not working.
> two ANDRITZ pumps with the following performance:
* Q=2,000 1/sec H=0.7 MPa N=200 kWt;
The pumps start operating at a maximum water level of 12.60 m and stop when water level drops
to 11.60m.
Kalimok IDS was destroyed and the equipment was dismantled. It was set into operation in
1971. The pumping station had two 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,300 I/sec H=0.7 MPa N=200 kWt;
Kalimok IDS used to re-pump water from MDC - 2 into the Danube at the 440 river km.
IDS III (Tutrakan) was set into operation in 1952. It gets water from MDC - 2 and re-pumps it
into the Danube at the 436 river km. It drains around 1,463.6 ha. The pumping station has:
r two ANDRITZ pumps with the following performance:
* Q=2,000 I/sec H=0.7 MPa N=200 kWt;
?> two 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,300 1/sec H=1.3 MPa N=l6OkWt;
> two Vero Mavag pumps with the following performance:
* Q=750 I/sec   H=0.7 MPa N=60 kWt;
The pumps start operating when water level reaches 12.80 m and stop when water level drops to
11.80 m.
The draining pumping stations are situated in a lengthwise succession from west to east.
Water is taken to the draining pumping stations via a system of drainage canals which is con-
nected to MDC - 1 and MDC -2.
All drainage canals have a trapezoidal vertical section and are not coated. Only P-1 channel has
been coated with reinforced concrete slabs from 0+000 to 0+500 km.
Brushlen Drainage System includes:
p MDC - 1 with basic specifications:
* Total length L= 16,890 m.;
* Bottom width of the channel B=5.00 - 8.50 m.

When matching the capacity of drainage canals to the amount of underground water the run-off
of the irrigation system was added.
159 monitoring wells, situated evenly in the drained area, were built to monitor the level of un-
derground water.
The irrigation system in the territory under consideration consists of:
(i)   irrigation pumping stations - PS 23 and PS 24;
(ii)  sprinkling pumping stations - Nova Chema - 1 SPS;
(iii)  distribution channels - P-3, P-4, P-4a and P-5;
(iv)  compensating basin for Nova Chema - 1 SPS;
(v)   irrigation fields.
PS 23 is a floating pumping station, built on the Danube at the 458 river km in the Kaleto Area
in close proximity to the villages of Riahovo and Brushlen.
PS 23 is the first step of Brushlen Irrigation System. Currently it has 11 NDN pumps with the
following basic performance:
* Q=500 1/sec   H=l.0 MPa N=60 kWt;
The pumping station was built in 1951. It gets water from the Danube at the 458 river km. It
feeds water to P-2 Channel and supplies water to PS 24 via P-3 Channel. PS 23 also includes an
electric substation and a building for the personnel.
There is an opening in the dyke having 3 sluices, which are 1.50 m in width, for gravity irriga-
tion water feed when the river water level is high.
PS 23 feeds water to the land of the villages of Brushlen, Goliamo and Malko Vranovo, Stam-
bolovo, Kosharna, Borisovo and Nova Chema. The irrigated land is municipal and private. 6,000

ha. can be irrigated. The on-site inspection (July 2001) discovered that an agreement related to
the irrigation of 160 ha. had been concluded.
PS 24 was built about 1 km west of the village of Brushlen. PS 24 was designed to be a lifting
pumping station - it gets water from P-3 Channel and feeds water to P-4, P-4 and P-5 Channels
and supplies water to PS 25, PS - 25a, etc. PS 24 has 12 pumps:
t one 16 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=500 1/sec H=l.0 MPa N=75 kWt;
s three 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,100 1/sec H=2.6 MPa N=250 kWt;
* four 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,300 1/sec H=2.6 MPa N=400 kWt;
- four 24 NDN pumps with the following performance:
* Q=1,400 1/sec H=2.1 MPa N=475 kWt;
The pumping station was built in 1951 and reconstructed in 1964. It feeds water to 28,905.8 ha.
of irrigated land.
Nova Cherna - 1 SPS is a sprinkling station designed to irrigate via sprinkling 387.8 ha. of irri-
gated land. It gets water from a compensating basin (P-4 Channel). Nova Chema - 1 SPS has
four 130 BC - 70 pumps with the following performance:
* Q=80 1/sec    H=8.0 MPa N=160 kWt;
Nova Chema - 1 SPS was built in 1991. It gets water from P-4 Channel (compensating basin)
and feeds water to Nova Cherna - 1 Irrigation Field (IF).
Distribution Channel - P-3 starts from a manhole of PS 23 and feeds water to PS 24. The chan-
nel is 4,476 m long. It was coated almost entirely, only the last 506 m were not coated and were
simply dug in the soil. It is intended to distribute 9,500 I/sec.
P-4 Channel starts from the manhole of P-5 Irrigation Channel and feeds irrigation water to the
Nova Chema Hydro-technical Unit (HTU). The channel is 4,260 long, has a trapezoidal section
and was coated. It is intended to distribute 800 1/sec.
There is a compensating basin built in P-4 Channel before Nova Chema - 1 SPS. The compen-
sating basin is a widening of the channel. It has a trapezoidal vertical section with the following
basic parameters:
* bottom of the channel 10 m;
* batter 1: 1.5;
* depth of water in the channel 1.30;
* length 390 m;
* backwater volume 5,840 cu. m.
P-4-a Channel starts after a manhole of PS 24 and feeds irrigation water to the adjacent 504.8
ha. of irrigation land around the village of Brushlen. The channel has a trapezoidal section, was
coated and is 5,553 m long. It is intended to distribute 1,000 I/sec.

The following equipment supports the distribution irrigation channels: bridges; return siphons;
water dividers; gates; passenger bridges; water outlets; shafts.
The current stage of inspection did not specify the number of the pieces of equipment that are re-
lated to the territory under consideration.
The condition of the operating pumping stations is satisfactory. The pumping units were installed
40-50 years ago but they operate only a few months in the year and are well maintained.
The coating of the irrigation is in good condition.
Out of the five draining pumping stations only three are operational at present.
The accumulated sediments in the drainage canals are systematically cleaned up. At the time of
the inspection there was intense excavation to clean up the MDCs and other channels in the cen-
tral and eastern part of the project territory.
111.1.1.5. Water Supply Wells
The underground water in the terrace of the Danube is a water supply source for a number of
population centers in the northeast of Bulgaria.
Northeast of the village of Riahovo there is a group of 6 Ranney wells, which after the Babovo
PS feed 1,380 1/sec of drinking water into the Danube Water Supply System.
Six more wells with a total capacity of 2,200 1/sec were intended to be built east of the existing
ones but they had not been built. Under the existing sanitary protection zone (SPZ) according to
Bulgarian drinking water supply regulations (there are two types of SPZ) plan, Zone I covers
4,701.4 ha. around the wells, Zone II borders on the dyke to the south and covers 99.4 ha.
The villages of Brushlen, Goliamo and Malko Vranovo have a water supply from local sources
of water - water catchment and tube wells.
Some 3 km east of the town of Tutrakan there are 5 Ranney wells, of which three are operational
and feed around 300 I/sec to the Tutrakan Water Supply System, which covers 15 population
centers including the village of Nova Cherna, the town of Tutrakan and the pig farm situated
northeast of the village of Nova Cherna. Zone I of the three operational wells covers 2.5 ha. The
sanitary and protection areas around the sources of water do not meet the requirements of Regu-
lation No. 3 of the Ministry of Environment and Water, the Ministry of Public Health and the
Ministry of Regional Development and Public Works dated October 16, 2000.
111.1.1.6. Nova Cherna Fish Ponds
The largest fishponds in Bulgaria, covering a total of 520 ha., were built in the Tutrakan Marsh
in 1981. The high cost of maintaining the necessary water exchange forced the government to
close down the ponds. Currently the fishponds are covered with reeds and the fish feeding facili-
ties have been abandoned and degraded.
111.1.1.7. Pig Farm
It is situated northeast of the village of Nova Cherna and has not been operational in recent
years. According to data received on the site, it is expected that the farm will begin to breed pigs
in the autumn of 2001. The projected capacity of the pig farm is 25,000 pigs. About 8,000 pigs
are expected to be bred. There is a mechanical wastewater treatment plant built at the pig farm
(screens, settling tanks and putrefaction beds).

111.1.1.8. Roads
The territory under consideration has several types of roads that are used by the population:
(i)   country roads - they connect the villages in the area to the Ruse-Tutrakan-Silistra Road.
They are asphalt roads and are maintained by the local traffic authorities;
(ii)  access roads - they were built to provide access to the facilities of Brushlen DIS. They
are asphalt roads and are some 2.5 m wide;
(iii)  fleld roads - mainly dirt roads that provide access to arable land;
(iv)  tracks to the boat docks along the Danube - village of Nova Cherna.
111.1.1.9. Power Cables
There is an external power supply for the population centers, pumping stations (draining, irrigat-
ing and water supply pumping stations) and the pig farm. Depending on the capacity built, there
are electric switchgear kiosks or electric substations to the pumping stations.
III.1.2.FACILITIES TO BE AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED RESTORATION OF WETLANDS
The restoration of wetlands should be within acceptable limits, that is the creation of prerequi-
sites for flooding part of Belene Island and Kalimok-Brushlen at the so-called "cherry" water
level (high water levels in spring) should not pose a danger of flooding any adjacent population
centers and facilities that will remain operational after the restoration of the wetlands.
111.1.2.1. Belene Island
The restoration of the wetlands of Belene Island should be done in a way guaranteeing that the
prison facility built in the west of the island and its supporting engineering structure will be pre-
served.
The facilities whose operation concerns the entire island are:
* protecting dykes in the Danube;
* drinking water source - a water supply well with a pumping station.
The protecting dykes in the Danube should not be destroyed. If Zone I of the drinking water
source would be flooded, then there should be constant access to the well and constant power
supply. There is no risk of flooding of the drinking water source but the maintenance personnel
may have difficulties in accessing it.
The facilities that are situated in the area under consideration for flooding but are related to the
prison are:
* farmn buildings for the sheep farm;
* access roads.
The facilities whose operation may be affected by the restoration works are:
* Persina - 2 DPS;
* drainage canals to the pumping stations;
* access road to the pumping station;
* power supply of the pumping station.

The protecting dyke in the Danube should be preserved. The farm buildings to the sheep farm
may be moved to a suitable place subject to discussion with the Ministry of Justice. Persina - 2
DPS can stop operating and be destroyed.
A flood scenario at a water level of 20.00 m was selected for Belene Island with possible op-
tions:
Proposed flood options are:
* flood an area of 1,562.2 ha. in options 1 and 3 and 1,289 ha. in options 2 and 4.
* build 2 inlets to let water from the Danube to the wetlands - 2 locks in the dyke in the
Danube: in the south end of the island in options 1 and 2 and in the north one in options 3
and 4.
* build an outlet in the east of the island in all the four options.
* build a protecting dyke along an existing road, which will be 1,990 m long 20.50 m high
to restrict flooding to the west - options 2 and 4.
* The four options under consideration suggest that Persina - 2 DPS and the sheep farm
buildings should stop operating.
The proposed destruction of the facilities involves dismantling equipment and tearing down
buildings. At this point of research no estimate has been made whether the equipment could be
used for other facilities. The amount of waste has not been calculated, nor has a site been se-
lected where it could be disposed of.
111.1.2.2. Kalimok-Brushlen
The necessary amount of soil for building the internal protecting dykes has not been estimated
nor have any potential quarries been searched for Kalimok-Brushlen. The facilities whose opera-
tion may be indirectly affected by the affected by the restoration works are:
* protecting dykes in the Danube;
* irngation pumping stations PS 23, PS 24 and Nova Cherna - I SPS;
* P-3 distribution channel connecting PS 23 and PS 24;
* water supply tube wells and PS related to them;
* roads connecting the facilities to the road network in the area;
* external power supply of the pumping stations;
* pig farm.
The facilities listed above should not be flooded or destroyed. The ways in which the connecting
roads and the external power supply cables run may be changed. The facilities whose operation
may be directly affected by the restoration works are:
* draining pumping stations;
* drainage canals;
* access roads to pumping stations;
* external power supply of the pumping stations;
* fish ponds.

Depending on the selected area of the wetlands and the water level in them, the pumping sta-
tions, which will remain to be operational, will be determined. If necessary, the construction of
new draining pumping stations and drainage canals for them will be proposed.
All working pumping stations should have connecting roads and external power supply.
The long-time use of the fishponds has proved them to be inefficient and they are not used at the
moment.
The research carried out by HPC - Sofia and AQUATEST - Prague selected a flood level of
14.00 m on the basis of a hydrological analysis of the water of the Danube and the possibility of
a longer-lasting overflow. After the conditions of the terrain, the existing facilities and land own-
ership were taken into consideration, three flood options were proposed:
Alternative 1 - gravity flooding to the selected level via four locks in the dyke in the Danube:
two new and two existing ones for DPS II and Kalimok DPS. This type of flooding will concern
in part or in whole:
* P-3 Channel which is the connection between irrigation PS 23 and PS 24 and this will
make it impossible to feed irrigation water to a large part of the Brushlen Irrigation Sys-
tem located south of the area under consideration.
* DPS II-a is flooded. The pumping station was destroyed but this was not part of an ap-
proved project. The pumping station may have to be reconstructed.
* MDC -I and MDC - 2 are flooded. DPS II and DPS III should stop functioning as drain-
age pumping stations.
* the land will be drained at DPS III (Tutrakan). For this purpose the existing sluice will be
reconstructed and the land south of the dyke should be protected against any high water
level of the Danube.
* two new sluices in the internal dykes will be built to regulate water in the wetlands.
The flood area is 1,585 ha. with an average water depth of 0.32 m.
Alternative 2 - this alternative is analogous to Alternative I but flooding is limited to the west
and south areas of the protecting dykes.
This solution moves the flood area some 10 km east of P-3 Channel which will make it possible
to continue to operate the irrigation pumping stations PS 23 and PS 24. If necessary, DPS II-a
can be activated.
The flood land is 1,044 ha. with an average water depth of 0.42 m.
Alternative 3. The third alternative proposes the construction of 10 artificial lakes with an open
water space varying from 13 to 75 ha., water depth of 2-2.5 m. and hydraulic connection be-
tween them. Water will come from the Danube at a point, which is some 12 km. east of PS 23,
will pass through all the lakes and flow back into the river at DPS III. This solution makes it pos-
sible:
* to have water areas that are adequately situated and do not affect any buildings or equip-
ment of Brushlen IDS and private property.
* not to disrupt the operation of the irrigation pumping stations.
* to activate DPS II-a, if necessary
The flood land in Alternative 3 will be the smallest. The considerable depth of the individual
deep-water areas will require large-scale excavation activities.

Just as it was with Belene Island, the proposed destruction of the facilities in these options in-
volves dismantling equipment and tearing down buildings. At this point of rcsearch no estimate
has been made whether the equipment could be used for other facilities. The amount of waste has
not been calculated, nor has a site been selected where it could be disposed of. The necessary
amount of soil for building the internal protecting dykes has not been estimated nor have any po-
tential quarries been searched for.
III.1.3.FORECAST OF EXPECTED IMPACT
The restoration of wetlands will render half of the draining system built on Belene Island, the
better part (over 80 percent) of Brushlen Draining System, and part of (around 20 percent) of
Brushlen Irrigation System useless. Large hydrotechnical facilities will be destroyed and this will
affect not only the flood land but also the area, which is in close proximity to it. No economic
evaluation of flooding-related activities such as maintenance, electricity and benefits has been
made. Many of the hydrotechnical facilities are in poor state of repair or destroyed (particularly
those connecting to the fish farm in Kalimok-Brushlen). From the viewpoint of the drainage sys-
tem, the restoration of wetlands will lead to reduced maintenance expenses, including reduced
consumption of electric energy.
The restoration of wetlands may increase the filtration of water into the soil, respectively the
level of underground water. Riahovo DPS and Persina - 1 DPS will get an additional load and
this may require installation of new groups of pumps or construction of new DPSs.
The construction work will result in large quantities of building and vegetation refuse. There will
be large-scale excavation and filling activities related to the construction of temporary and per-
manent waste grounds and quarries will be searched for to provide soil necessary for the internal
dykes. Currently, neither sites for waste dumping, nor suitable quarries have been searched for.
According to preliminary estimates of the amount of harmful substances in the soil in the area
that will be flooded and of potential preventive measures, the water quality of drinking water
sources is not expected to get worse after the restoration of the wetlands.
The proposed flood levels take into account population centers and populated areas. Some of the
options envisage construction of internal protecting dykes.
As far as the destruction of buildings and equipment is concerned, the proposed options concern-
ing Belene Island are equivalent.
111.2. ATMOSPHERIC AIR
III.2.1.CLIMATE
The climate of the area of the banks of the Danube from Svishtov to Silistra which are part of the
territory of Northern Bulgaria is determined by the influence of its specific geographical situa-
tion, namely by the Danube banks, the absence of any barrier to the North for cold Northern and
Northeastern winds, the common transfer of air mass for the country and the typical air currents
for the river valleys. These basic features of the geographical situation of the city are not only re-
flected on climatic elements, but are also felt in the ecological situation of the studied area.
The climatic characteristics of the territory are based on the results of the observations in mete-
orological stations in Svishtov, Rousse and Silistra. Here we find included the main climatic
elements, which exert their influence on the ecological conditions, on the impact pollutants of
the environment, together with the transboundary transfer of atmospheric pollutants. As is well
known, on Romanian territory, 12 km northeast of Silistra, and close to Calara,i, there is a large
metallurgical combine, a chemical plant opposite Rousse, and the Zimnicea sugar plant opposite
Svishtov.

From a climatic point of view the observed region falls in the Danubian subregion of the moder-
ate-continental climatic subregion.
The openness of the area and the absence of mountains ringing it allow the free transfer of arctic
air mass from the northeast, in particular during the winter.
This in particular finds its reflection over the climate, making it close to a continental climate.
January is the coldest month of the year, July the warmest.
The relative air humidity corresponds to that of moderate geographic attitudes.
The region is characterized by considerable turbulence of air masses. Quiet weather amounts to
27-30% of the weather round the year.
The region has slightly expressed inversions in temperature.
Average wind speed is comparatively high in relation to other regions in Bulgaria. The climate
of the Danubian river basin is one of the most important factors for the biology of the river basin
and island vegetation. Its combination with the water regime of the Danube, which to a consider-
able extent affects the microclimate and relief of the banks and the islands, determines the dura-
tion of flooding and the level of subterranean waters.
The difference in geographical latitude between the most northern point of the Danubian river
basin at Silistra and that of its most southern point, Svishtov, is slight and it determines the in-
considerable climatic differences. The climate is moderate continental, with a hot summer and a
comparatively cold winter.
111.2.1.1. Air Temperature
The temperature regime of the studied territory is closely dependent on radiation conditions and
circulation processes. The analysis of the data of mean monthly temperatures shows that January
is the coldest month and July - the warmest. Mean annual temperature for Silistra is 11.6 0C to
12.1 0C, for Rousse the higher value of the mean temperature for the country (10.5 0C).
The appearance of extreme temperatures of atmospheric air depends on a specific geographic
situation, relief, altitude above sea level, the character of strata below the surface and atmos-
pheric circulation. For the studied territory the absolute maximum temperature was recorded in
August (41.0 - 43.0 C). The absolute minimum is between -27.7 and - 32.0 C. The amplitude of
temperatures is also a factor affecting diffusion of atmospheric pollutants. Its highest values were
observed in the warm six months of the year. Temperature is one of the most important factors
determining the nature of air masses, and exerts its influence on the changes of the remaining
meteorological elements, one of the most variable meteorological values. It depends on the geo-
graphic altitude of a locality, on altitude above sea level, on specific terrain features, air currents
etc.
The region along the Danube is characterized by a specific temperature regime because of its low
altitude a.s.l.; moreover it is open to the cold northeastern air masses, while Stara Planina and the
Rhodopes block the Mediterranean influence. These factors, together with a number of others
create the conditions for very high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter (table
2). The vegetation period includes the months of April, May, June, July, August, September and
October.
The analysis of data recorded over many years establishes that the mean annual temperature in
the examined region is approximately 11.7 0C, while the mean monthly temperature during the
vegetation period is 18.6 C. What is typical for these mean annual and mean monthly tempera-
tures is that during the vegetation period they are lowest in Silistra and Vidin and increase in

Svishtov and Rousse. A tendency emerges towards a rise in air temperatures in the more eastern
parts of the Danube region, moreover above all during the spring and summer months when the
mean meteorological data shows that the lowest temPeratures for the country were measured in
winter - January was the coldest month (-1.4 to -1.8 C). The warmest summer month is July
with mean temperatures 22.8-24,1 C. In the Danube region autumn is warmer than spring. High
annual amplitude was also measured in Svishtov (25.5 C) and Rousse (25.6 0C), which is typical
of continental climate. The regime and duration of the periods with mean 24 h temperatures
above 5,10 and 15 C is extremely important for the development and growth of forest vegeta-
tion, shrubs and grasses. So are the total temperatures for the separate thermnal boundaries.
The duration of the period including the days with air temperature above 5 C is almost 8
months, while the active vegetation period with average 24h temperatures above 10 0C were 6 to
7 months. The third period with mean night air temperatures above 15 C is a period of ripening,
i.e. lignification of tissues of forest vegetation, which continues between 5 and 5,5 months.
When an assessment of temperature is made, it is essential to determine an average date and a fi-
nal date of the last spring day, and the first cold day in the autumn, as well as the average dura-
tion of the weather without any frost (table 3).
The dates of the last spring day or the setting in of the first autumn frost are also important.

The mean meteorological data recorded over many years has established that during the winter
season for the regions of the studied sites temperature fell below 0 0C Celsius. The lowest tem-
peratures for the country were recorded during the winter - January was the coldest month (-1.4
C to - 1.8 C). The warmest summer month was July with mean temperatures 22.8 - 24.1 C.
In the Danube region autumn is warmer than spring. High annual amplitude was also measured
in Svishtov (25.5 C) and Rousse (25.6 C), which is typical of continental climate. The regime
and duration of the periods with mean 24 h temperatures above 5,10 and 15 C is extremely im-
portant for the development and growth of forest vegetation, shrubs and grasses. So are the total
temperatures for the separate thermal boundaries.
The duration of the period including the days with air temperature above 5 C is almost 8
months, while the active vegetation period with average 24h temperatures above 10 C were 6 to
7 months. The third period with mean night air temperatures above 15 C is a period of ripening,
i.e. lignification of tissues of forest vegetation, which continues between 5 and 5,5 months.
When assessing temperature the respective average final date of the last spring and the first au-
tumn frost is of particular significance (table 3). Also the dates of the last spring or beginning of
the first autumn frost are important.

111.2.1.2. Rainfall
Rainfall is an important climatic element, affecting the purity of the atmospheric air, the quantity
and quality of waters. The specific geographical features, the transfer of air masses and their
transformation is reflected in the type of rainfall, the quantity of rainfall and its distribution. The
average annual total of rainfall for the studies region (500 mm - Silistra, 543 - Svishtov, 586 -
Rousse, 611 - Tutrakan) is below the average for the country (640 mm).
The maximum for the total of rainfall for the Danubian region is June. Drought sets in August-
September, which is decisive for the early cessation of vegetation in tree vegetation.
The quantity of rainfall along the Danubian region is lowest in comparison with the remaining
part of the country.
The regime of rainfall along the Danube banks has a marked continental character. The maxi-
mum is in June, the minimum in February.
From a climatic point of view the Danube region belongs to one of the driest parts of Bulgaria.
Rainfall is on average about 84-86% of the average rainfall for the country.
In July and August there is string fall in the level of the water in the Danube and the summer
heat sets in, resulting a radical change in the ecological situation. For the vegetation period the
average total of rainfall is 318 mm and the average number of days with rainfall is 37. This the
most marked continental climate in Bulgaria, typical for the Danubian plain.

111.2.2. SPECIFIC PHENOMENA AFFECTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL SITUATION IN THE DANUBE
LANDS AND THE THEIR VEGETATION
The icing of the river Danube is the result of the temperature fluctuation characterized by great
phase instability both in time and duration. Ice flow is observed in December and March - freez-
ing of the river in December and February and melting and clearing of ice in January and March.
Ice persists for 91 days and the ice flow lasts 74 days. The average annual probability for the oc-
currence of ice in the Bulgarian section is 82%. A significant influence on ice formation is the
specific location of the Iron Gate section, where the river bed is narrowing and the ice flowing
from the middle section of the river Danube is arrested before the sluice facility, causing the
formation of new ice in the lower section of the Danube under local conditions and reduced
speed of the river flow. During intensive melting flooding occurs along the Bulgarian side of the
riverbank, which is caused by the water inflow formed in the upper and middle section of the
Danube. Within the period of 8 days on average after the ice melts, the river Danube is cleared
from ice.
Another hazardous natural phenomenon typical of the Danube region is landslide processes. Dur-
ing the dry summer and autumn period landslide along the Bulgarian bank of the Danube nor-
mally lose their intensity and new landslides develop after the rapid snow melting. The majority
of landslides along the Danube bank originate from the past, whereas the newly formed ones ap-
pear less frequently. Linear-bloc and circus type landslides are predominant. They are located in
terraces mainly in the high and medium portions of the Danube bank. The great length of the
river and its watershed with an area equal to 1/12 part of Europe are responsible to a great extent
for the extremely specific environmental character of its neighboring lands. Meteorological phe-
nomena occurring far from Bulgaria (snow melting in the Alps and Carpathians, rainfalls in Cen-
tral Europe) cause frequent and prolonged inflows of tremendous water volumes, resulting in
typical inundation in summer and later periods, creating almost everywhere optimal condition for
the settling and growth of water-loving vegetation, the reproduction of thermopile species of
fish, and feeding and reproduction of waterfowl. The river's impact on the microclimatic charac-
Environmental Assessment                                                             21

teristics of islands and riverside areas is particularly strong. An immense amount of gravel and
sand regularly carried by the river's waters are settling when encountering even the smallest ob-
stacle in their way. Sometimes settled sediments create a small island that might exist for only
one season or several years.
111.2.3. SOURCES OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE PRO-
JECT AREA.
Sources of air pollution in the region of the island of Belene are located in the Bulgarian cities of
Nikopol and Svishtov, and the Rumanian cities Turnu Magurele and Zimnicea. Due to the pre-
dominant west winds the most significant pollution source is the nitrate fertilizer plant in Turnu
Magurele (about 25 Km. to the west) with major emissions of nitrate oxides, ammonium, and
sulfuric dioxide. The other major pollution source is the Sviloza chemical plant in Svishtov, 4
Km. to the east with most hazardous emissions of mercaptans and other organic compounds, is
not of great significance because of its considerably reduced production and the less frequent
east winds. Almost entirely out of operation are the industrial enterprises in the Bulgarian city of
Nikopol.
The industrial enterprises in the biggest Bulgarian city of the Danube - Rousse (about 35 Km. to
the southwest) are influencing the second project are - Kalimok - Brushlen, as well as the Ro-
manian cities of Giurgiu (about 35 Km. to the southwest) and Oltenita (8 Km. to the northeast).
As mentioned above, west winds are predominant in the two regions. No specific studies of the
transport of pollutants (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) by the atmosphere and rainfalls
into the water have been made in these parts of Bulgaria. Thus the amount of nitrogen in particu-
lar, falling out into the surface waters through atmospheric settling is unknown. Moreover, a
source of serious air pollution with ammonia nitrogen exists in the region of the island of Belene
- the fertilizer factory Turnu in the town of Turnu Magurele in Romania. No data concerning the
impact of acid rains in both regions could be found.
111.2.4.POSSIBLE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS
We believe the restoring of wetlands (marshes) in the two territories (no matter which one of the
alternatives) will lead to a certain microclimatic change: reducing heat in summer and some in-
crease of air humidity. This change will be insignificant and will be manifest in a very narrow
area in the immediate vicinity of the wetlands.
During the construction period certain amounts of dust and waste gases from the machines will
be generated. At the present stage of the study no exact estimation of the emissions can be made.
However, these would not represent a serious risk for the local population, biodiversity and in-
frastructure.
It is not clear to what extent the atmospheric deposition of pollutants and nutrients (nitrogen and
phosphorus) will influence the restored wetlands. This will be taken into consideration in design
of the monitoring system - to monitor of nitrogen and phosphorus balance within these ecosys-
tems.
111.3. SURFACE WATER AND GROUND WATER
III.3. 1. THE RIVER DANUBE
The river Danube is second biggest in Europe. Its springs from the Schwarzwald mountain and is
2850 km. long. It flows through Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Yugoslavia and into the Black Sea
forming a delta.

Major tributaries in the region of Bulgaria are Lom, Ogosta, Iskar, Vit, Osam, Yantra, and Rous-
senski Lom. Bulgaria and Romania are located in the southeastern part of Europe, around the
Black Sea, i.e. in the lower stretch of the river Danube. Their common border is 631.3 km long,
of which 420 km along the midstream of the Danube.
The two states experience intensive pollution of the Danube water, which is generated at its up-
per sectors.
The Danube hydrographic area includes 49630 km2 or 42.3 % of the territory of Bulgaria.
Main tributaries - water catchment areas: Ogosta - 3154 kn2; Iskar - 8646 km2; Vit - 3225  2.
Osam - 2824 km2 ; Yantra - 7869 km2; Roussenski Lom - 2974 km2.
Surface waters are affected by factors, such as the afforestation, amount of precipitation, and the
anthropogenic impact on nature.
The zone adjacent to the Danube consists of flooded low lands and plains - 10 - 12 km. It has a
moderately continental climate. Precipitation is 673 mm on the average ranging from 450 to
1200 mm. Hydrological conditions are subject to a considerable anthropogenic impact.
The level mode of the Danube is very complicated as the river flows through different climatic
zones and along its route receives tributaries with varying characteristics of supply. In its upper
sector, the river Danube is fed by water originating from alpine glaciers and rainfalls. In its mid-
dle section the river receives waters from the big rivers Tisza, Sava, Drava and Morava, which
have a significant influence over the Danube. In the area of the lower Danube all rivers springing
from Stara Planina and the Danube lowlands flow into the river. Due to intensive snow melting
the outflow maximum in the Bulgarian section of the river is in April. The abundant supply from
rainfalls during the following months in the upper and middle sections of the river brings about
an increased monthly outflow also in May. After May the outflow is reduced. The maximum out-
flow with a probability of an increase of 1 % is about 18000 m3/sec.
The minimum outflow of the river Danube in the lower Danube basin is changed by 2379 m3/sec
at Silistra. This slight increase of the minimum outflow can be explained by the greater subterra-
nean supply of alluvial waters in the widely developed inundation terrace of the river Danube at
its lower section. Despite the fact that the Bulgarian riverbank is higher than the Romanian one,
in the event of a more significant increase of the river level floods occur and in order to prevent
them many protective dykes have been built along the Bulgarian bank of the river.

111.3.2. SEDIMENTS (ALLUVIA)
Of particular interest are the sandy fine-grade sediment strips along the riverbank and the main-
land. They settle every year from the flowing waters and are formed below and around the aver-
age level. After the flow-off these strips are covered by self-sprouting willows and are elevated
each year increasing the area of the islands.
The areas of ditchcs along the river dyke are inundated according to their depth. However, the
water stays still for a longer period.
Soils are of alluvial character and morphology with a variable mechanical composition of the al-
luvial layers (at the surface the mud mechanical fraction is always predominant). The mode of
water inundation results in a variable character of the alluvial materials and their size. In the zone
of lasting inundation and in the lowest sections of the terrain fine-grade mud-like alluvia are set-
tling. In the zone of inundation of medium duration and in the medium-level parts of the terrain
medium-sized sandy and slimy alluvia and in the zone of brief inundation and in the highest ter-
rain sectors - the coarsest grained sandy alluvia. The fornation and distribution of the soils typi-
cal for each inundation zone corresponds to this mode of settling.
111.3.3. GROUNDWATER
Along with relief and water inundation, groundwater is the third significant factor determining
the soil water mode as an element of the habitat of vegetation along the Danube basin. Studies
have shown that groundwater are highest (about 100-200 cm from the surface on the average
during the dry summer period) in the zone of long-lasting flooding and wet meadow soils; they
are medium (about 250-300 cm from the surface) in the zone of medium-duration water inunda-
tion and alluvial-meadow soils; and lowest in the zone of short period water inundation and allu-
vial soils (about 400-450 cm from the surface on the average). Groundwater in the highest river-
side sections of the terrain, and respectively with the carbonate black-earth soils practically does
not occur. On the other hand, the capillary rising of soil humidity originating from the groundwa-
ter reaches the surface in the first case, up to 50-60 cm from the surface in the second, and 80-
150 cm in the third case. Movement of humidity in depth down to 30 - 60 cm was found during
the dry period depending on the soil type. A source of this descending humidity are rainfalls and
the residual moistening of the surface soil layers after the flowing off of the inundation waters.
A detailed hydrogeological study to take place during the project phase is absolutely required. It
is very important in order to evaluate the risks for ground water impact on agricultural land, risk
areas, possible marshes and salination of soils.
111.3.4. SOIL HUMIDITY
The soil humidity in the habitat resultant of the inundation along the Danube riverside during the
dry summer period of the vegetation season is considerable. However, as a consequence of the
Environmental Assessment                                                             24
Wetlands Restoration and Pollution Reduction Project

two-way movement, the humidity within the different soil types has its own specific characteris-
tics. Alluvial soils are fresh and moderately humid. Humidity in the surface layers is about 24.23
% and decreases to 10.03 % on the average in the lower layers, increasing anew in depth to 18.15
% on the average. Alluvial and meadow soils are characterized as ranging between fresh and
humid and have a water mode similar to that of alluvial soils. Moisture content in the upper hu-
mus layer may reach 14.26 % on the average and increase again in depth to 16.11 % on average.
The highest wetting occurs in meadow and swampy soils. Unlike the first type, it changes
slightly in depth (from about 32.4 1% to 28.33 %). Carbonate black earth soils are least mois-
tened during the dry months of the vegetation period. The content of soil moisture is evenly dis-
tributed along the soil profile - from 6.10 - 7.03 % to 9.68 - 16.03 % on average.
Taking into account the soil moistening mode and the specifics of water inundation, the conclu-
sion might be drawn that terrains in the zone of medium inundation are fresh to humid, whereas
those in the zone not subject to inundation are dry.
111.3.5.WATER QUALITY AND POLLUTION SOURCES
The sites in question are located on the banks of the Danube. The Danube river meets the
Bulgarian water quality standards (Regulation N 7/1986 and Order RD-272/03.05.2001 of the
MoEW on Classification of Surface Water Bodies in Bulgaria. All data from the recent years
(National Eco-Monitoring System, International Program on the Danube) have shown certain
trends toward improvement of the quality of water in the Danube. This is mainly due to the eco-
nomic crisis in both Bulgaria and Rumania. The monitoring points nearest to the Belene island
are near the town of Nikopol (upstream of Belene island) and near the town of Svishtov (down-
stream of Belene island; the only monitoring point in serving the Kalimok-Brushlen area is the
one downstream of the town of Rousse. The monitoring points near the town of Svishtov and
downstream of the town of Rousse are part of the international Danube monitoring network. For
example, the concentrations in 1999 measured for the main parameters in both these points are as
follows (in mg/i): suspended solids (SS) 18 - 38, ammonia (N-NH4) 0.01 - 0.28, nitrate (N-NO3)
1.0 - 2.59, phosphates (P-PO4) 0.08 - 0.36, total phosphorus (P) 0.14 - 1.36, BOD5 2.55 - 5.4,
COD (Cr) 10.7 - 21.5. It can be seen from this data that the quality of water in the Danube is in a
good condition. However, the biggest problem for the quality of water remains the accidental
pollution - mainly oil spills and, less frequently, accidents such as the cyanide pollution of the
river Tissa and of the Danube from the Rumanian mine Baya Mare.
111.3.6.POLLUTION SOURCES AFFECTING THE PROJECT AREAS
111.3.6.1. Belene Island
There are no significant pollution sources directly affecting both project areas. For the island of
Belene these are the manure volumes from sheep breeding farms (400 sheep and 200 lambs)
property of the prison, which are openly deposited on the terrain. They are located in the neigh-
borhood of prison facility No. 2, situated between the three marshes: Martvoto, Peschina and
Doulyova Bara. This is organic pollution source, which should be taken into account in the
planning of restoration works. The remaining waste waters originating on the island from a cat-
tle-breeding farm (200 cattle), household sewerage from the prison, diffused pollution from agri-
cultural areas etc. including a small number of goats (55 goats), rabbits (100 rabbits) as well as
ducks (100 ducks) discharge directly or are filtered through drainage channels connected to
drainage pumping stations Persin 1 and 2. Considerably greater concentrations of nitrogen and
phosphorus were found during a study of discharge channels undertaken by our team at both
pumping stations. A potential source of nitrogen compounds pollution for the island of Belene is
the fertilizer works in Turnu Magurele. According to data provided by the Environment Execu-
tive Agency, Sofia, considerable pollution of the Danube water was registered during the year
2000. The indices were: Nitrogen Ammonia (NH4-N) - 21.7 mg/l; Nitrogen Nitrite (NO2-N) -
Environmental Assessment                                                       25

0.15 mg/I; Nitrogen Nitrate (NO3-N) - 19.7 mg/l. These values were very high for a river with
the size of the Danube, which made the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources sub-
mit a Note of Protest to the Romanian government. Despite this heavy loading of the river with
nitrogen, due to the massive dilution of the Danube waters and the distance of more than 20 km
(self-purification processes) we consider the fertilizer works in Tumu Magurele to be only a po-
tential source of nitrogen pollution. High nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the river
Danube have never been found in the area of the island of Belene itself. The monitoring station
at the city of Svishtov (some 10 km downstream from the island of Belene) to the International
Program for the river Danube has not been included in the analysis as we believe that the data
are not representative for the project territory because of the fact that the station measures and
records the impact of the city of Svishtov, the Sviloza chemical plant and pollution resulting
from the Svishtov port.
111.3.6.2. Kalimok and Brushlen
The only pollution sources on this territory are diffuse and related to agriculture (growing of
maize, tobacco, etc.) and extensive stock breeding (goats, cattle, sheep). It should be noted that
no problem of excessive use of fertilizers exists in the country and both project areas. This is a
result of the economic crisis and the high price of artificial fertilizers. Potential pollution sources
can be the cities Rousse and Giurgiu. Their impact is local in principle and does not approach the
project territory because of the great dilution and the self-purification processes. The pig farm at
the village of Brushlen is not functioning at present, but if it is again put into operation, it might
affect the project territory, because of the discharge of partially treated waste water in the river
Danube (only mechanical treatment is applied).
III.3.7.AMBIENT WATER QUALITY
The state of water quality in the Danube is established by a database of the National Monitoring
System, as well as water research data, related to a number of studies, programs, projects (local
and international) etc.
The studies on water quality of the Danube are also subject of a number of international pro-
grams and projects. The objectives and criteria in the sphere of water quality of the river Danube
are currently in a realization stage in accordance with the Danube River Protection Convention.
Bulgaria and Romania were the first countries along the river Danube to start in 1996 exchange
of data on the quality of the river Danube water in line with international standards.
The activities within the framework of the Bucharest Declaration (1985) are related to the Pro-
gram for the Environment in the Hydrographic Basin of the Danube from 1991 The activities in-
clude a development in stages of a transnational monitoring system on the Danube, a guaranteed
quality of the data - international intercalibration programs, putting into operation of a system for
public information about any accidental pollution.
The water quality of the Danube River meets the Bulgarian environmental standards. Neverthe-
less, the major problems of the river Danube are related to the fact of introducing great amounts
of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.) leading to algae 'blooms' in the river and in the Black
Sea.
A number of local pollution sources exist along the river Danube, the so-called hot spots, creat-
ing a risk for disturbance of the environmental balance in individual stretches of the river, pollu-
tion with toxic substances in the bottom sediments, suspended solids, water organisms, etc. Point
sources along the Bulgarian section are the sewer systems discharging industrial and household
wastewater of individual towns and villages. In the area of Belene Island such are found in
Svishtov (industrial plants including the Sviloza chemical plant and household waste waters), in

the area of Kalimok-Brushlen, wastewater from Rousse (oil refinery, power station, food indus-
try, leather, textile, machine building companies etc), as well as household waste waters and
sewer systems for waste water from Tutrakan (industrial and household wastewater), as well as
from Silistra - industrial plants including LPK Silistra (fiberboard production), the food industry
and household waste water.
Diffuse sources of pollution (mainly organic substances and nutrients): stockbreeding farms,
(cattle, pig, sheep, etc.), fertilizing with nitrogen and phosphorus of agricultural land, erosion, air
pollution resulting from nitrogen emissions from power plants and household heating.
The military conflict in Yugoslavia, the environmental crisis caused by cyanide pollution from
the Baya Mare mine in Romania, increased the public interest in the environmental problems of
the river Danube and led to the undertaking of a number of complex studies of the water in the
individual sections.
The state of emissions along the river Danube at present and in the area of the considered pro-
jects has been determined on the basis of drawing up inventory lists, analyses and evaluation of
the existing information about the state of the water of the river Danube.
Data on the state of the river Danube at the stations of the national monitoring system: the river
Danube after Svishtov, Rousse, Tutrakan and Silistra.
Regular observations of the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the river water along
the Bulgarian bank of the river are made by means of the stations for observations and control,
which are part of the national system for environmental monitoring. Aimed at assessing the
background state of the river waters and their alteration as a result of antropogenous or natural
impact. The monitoring stations regularly measure 24 physical and chemical water quality de-
terminands (pH, BOD5, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation; COD, dissolved solids, suspended
solids, conductivity; sulfate ions, chlorine ions, ammonia-, nitrite- and nitrate nitrogen; phos-
phates etc. In some of the stations a number of specific indicators are measured in addition,
namely: metal ions, oil products, detergents, pesticides, etc.
The assessment of surface water quality is carried out on the basis of Regulation No. 7/1986.
In addition to the physical and chemical monitoring, biological surface water monitoring is also
undertaken. An express technique is applied, related to determining of macro-invertebrate indica-
tor taxa according to a five-degree scale, recording the result of the integral impact of pollutants
on the basis of bio-indicators leading to lasting alterations of water quality for a long period of
time.
The investigation of bottom sediments reveals a high presence of metal ions.
> The water and sediment quality of the Danube river were assessed by an expedition working
from the 3 July to 13 July 2000 - organized by the Executive Environmental Agency under
the Ministry of Environment and Water. The main objectives of that study was:
* To assess the nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the river water as well as the general
physicochemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, and transpar-
ency).
* To analyze of the heavy metal content in the bottom sediments and water samples in
those river sections where such pollution is to be expected.
* To analyze the heavy-metal bioaccumulation in fishes.
* To survey rare waterfowl colonies on islands in Bulgarian territorial waters.

Integrated studies were conducted in the project areas. Water samples from individual points in
the project areas were studied between August 3 and August 6, 2001. The results showed that the
remaining wetlands feature frequently deteriorated environmental conditions with frequently oc-
curring hypoxia, blooming of algae and high content of nutrients as compared to the Danube.
The present marshes are subject to severe degradation.
The results of the study are presented in Appendix No. 7: Physical and Chemical Analysis of
Water Samples
111.3.8. ANALYSES AND DATA EVALUATION
111.3.8.1. Water quality
Physical and chemical parameters - All of the studied physical and chemical indicators (pH,
conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, COD, BOD5, Ammonia nitro-
gen (NH4-N); Nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N); Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphates (PO4) at
the stations in Novo Selo near Silistra do not exceed the Maximum Permissible Levels (incl. the
areas of environmental assessment) of the emission standards set forth in Regulation No. 7 (State
Gazette, No. 96/12.12.1986), and meet the requirements of the planned 3rd class with the excep-
tion of ammonia nitrogen, which is sporadically exceeded in individual stretches. The results of
the studies of the Bulgarian section of the river show a negligible influence of the tributaries on
the Danube River water quality along the Bulgarian part. The pollution impact of Bulgarian
tributaries is very low because of a big self-purification capacity of the Danube.
> Water samples analyzed in terms of indicators, such as: cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper
(Cu), Zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), cobalt
(Co) along the entire river Danube were found to be many times below the maximum per-
missible levels of surface waters according to Regulation No. 7.
> Sediment quality (bottom sediments) The following sediment parameters were analyzed
(all-round study of EEA in 2000, for the following metals):
* Lead (Pb) - Values exceeding 20 mg/kg (3-4 times) were recorded along the entire length
of the river Danube including the sections after Nikopol, Rousse and Silistra.
* Copper (Cu) - Values exceeding 20 mg/kg (2-8 times) were recorded in the middle of the
Danube River including the sections after Nikopol, Rousse and Silistra.
* Zinc (Zn) - No cases of values exceeding 500 mg/kg were registered.
* Manganese (Mn) - Values exceeding 500 mg/kg were registered in the river section after
Nikopol - Tumu Magurele and Silistra (up to 1.75 times the target limit).
* Chromium (Cr) - Values exceeding 3 times the standard of 20 mg/kg were found after
Nikopol - Tumu Magurele and Silistra.
* Nickel (Ni) - Nickel values exceed 20 mg/kg and reach the maximum value - 66 mg/kg at
Silistra.
* Cadmium (Cd) - Values exceeding 3 times the standard of 0.5 mg/kg were recorded in
the river section after Nikopol - Tumu Magurele and Silistra.
A conditional comparison with average values set forth in line with the Intemational Danube
Program was made concerning the indicators along the Bulgarian section of the river Danube
and the study conducted by EEA.
Results of measured indicators show excessive amounts of Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, and Cd in sedi-
ments.

Conclusions
> The waters of the river Danube entering Bulgarian territory are carriers of a considerable
volume of pollutants.
> The main sources of pollution in the Bulgarian section of the river Danube are related to
transboundary pollution - the Timok river polluted by the Bor mines in Yugoslavia, the
Turnu Magurele fertilizer plant opposite Nikopol, etc.
* Certain slight rise of the level of predominantly organic pollution is found on the Bulgarian
bank of the river after the sewerage discharge of towns and villages including Svishtov,
Rousse, Tutrakan and Silistra, carrying pollutants from household and industrial wastes, as
well as the inflow of the Iskar and Yantra tributaries.
III.3.9.TRANSFORMATION OF WATER POLLUTANTS
The concentration of polluting substances changes as a result of hydrodynamic, physical and
chemical, biological and biochemical processes taking place in the receiving river. An important
part is played by the oxidizing and restoring processes, absorption and desorption, and the
formation of insoluble compounds. The transformation processes of organic compounds are an
important factor influencing the state of water ecosystems. As a result of self-purification proc-
esses, organic substances undergo qualitative changes, which are mostly harmless. Biochemical
oxidation of organic substances takes place in two phases: carbon -dioxide and nitric. During the
first phase, organic compounds of carbon dioxide are decomposed and during the second one
processes of decomposition of organic nitrogen - ammonification and nitrification take place as a
result of the functioning of heterotrophic bacteria. Nitrification is a process of biochemical am-
monia ions being oxidized to nitrites and nitrates by autotrophic microorganisms. In the absence
or presence of a minimum content of oxygen in the water, denitrification processes may develop.
Intermediate products are nitrites and nitrogen oxides, of which N20 is mostly emitted in the air.
Nitrates are usually reduced to molecular nitrogen.
The non-transparency of water has a considerable impact on the primary occurrence of denitrifi-
cation processes.
The dynamics of nutrients depends on both the seasonal alterations and their content in the river
waters. Nitrogen reduction in wetland zones can be assessed after the processing of a sufficient
amount of information which will be collected from own monitoring data during operation in
wetland zones.
The expected reduction of nitrogen pollutants in the waters of the river Danube resulting from
the wetlands restoration is insignificant.
Phosphorus is found in water areas mostly in the form of inorganic phosphorus compounds. Or-
ganically bound phosphorus occurs in dissolved state as phosphate in the organisms or sedi-
ments. Bacteria and plant organisms as a phosphorus source use dissolved inorganic phosphate
compounds in the form of dissociated ions. Dissolved and organically bound phosphate is turned
in orthophosphate during the process of phosphatization. In many instances the absorption of or-
ganic carbon compounds in the river ecosystems can be realized only in the presence of nitrogen
and phosphorus.
Phosphorus reduction in wetland zones is expected to be minimal in terms of its contribution to
the reduction of the total volume of nutrients in the waters of the Danube.

111.4. WASTES
Household, building, industrial and hazardous wastes are generated on the territory of the con-
sidered areas:
> Household waste (code 20.03.01) generated by visitors to the area, by the human settle-
ments, the prison in Belene (the island of Belene), workers during the construction and de-
velopment of the wetland zones, etc.
In the studied territory there is no waste landfill. Unofficial dumping sites exist close to settle-
ments on the borders of the examined territory. A pig-breeding complex has its own waste use
facilities, which however require additional study.
>- Construction waste (code 17.07.01) mixed
In the course of construction in the wetlands buildings are envisaged to be pulled down. Equip-
ment from pumping stations will be dismantled together with power lines to pumping stations,
At this phase of study the quantities of building material have not been established, as the alter-
native for flooding has not been chosen. Neither have landfills for construction waste been de-
termined. All alternatives envisage a large amount of digging and excavation work. This will re-
sult in large quantities of construction waste and vegetation residues waste. The landfills for this
waste have not been decided yet, neither the quantities of excavation work.
> Production waste
Construction waste will be generated in the course of construction operations from the mainte-
nance of the machines and facilities. It would consist of:
* Metal parts of the iron for reinforced slabs; machine parts; parts of steel ropes etc. They
will be gathered in containers and given to licensed companies for regeneration.
* Worn-out automobile tires (code 16.01.03) - worn-out car tires are gathered in containers
and sent for regeneration.
' Hazardous waste
Hazardous waste will be generated in the course of construction work by building machines and
transport vehicles.
* Used lubricants and oil products (code 13.01.00) - the change of oil will be done in a me-
chanical workshop and given to a licensed company for regeneration.
* Exhausted batteries (code 16.06.01) will be sent to a licensed company for regeneration.
The quantity of hazardous waste is minimal.
111.5. LANDS AND SOILS
According to thc geographical classifications the studied territory falls in the Carpathian-
Danubian soil region, the Lower Danubian soil subregion with the Danubian Dobrogea (Do-
brudzha) province.
The soil formation process in flooded riverbanks and islands runs over the sediments of the river
and under the influence of moisture hydrophilic tree vegetation, shrub vegetation and graminous
vegetation. Water flooding and subterranean waters exert adecisive impact on the formation of
soil with an intrazonal character of the range. In accordance with this the Danube banks and the
islands have formed the following soil types: alluvial types, alluvial meadow types, meadow-
swampy types with different transitions between them as well as carbonate smolnitza (vertisols,
FAO).

III.5. 1. TYPES OF SOILS
According to the Legend of soils of FAO (1988,1990) the following types of soil occur on the is-
land of Belene and the Kalimok-Brushlen complex:
111.5.1.1. Order - soils, not connected with zonal climatic conditions.
Fluvisols (FAO, 1988) (formerly referred to as alluvial soils)
Fluvisols are in an initial phase of soil formation, have only an A horizon, below it lie sedi-
mented layers of sand. In the development of a soil profile they evolve in chemozem or smol-
nitza (Mediterranean black soil). Alluvial soils are mineral and are characterized by lithological
layers and an uneven distribution of the humus in depth in the section.
Specific features:
* They are always found in the flood plain and the first terrace above of the river;
* They have shallow groundwater, from 1 to 3 m. deep, depending on the river regime;
* They are subjected periodically to flooding and further sedimentation with a new allu-
vium;
In their mechanical composition they are sand-gravel to slightly clayey. They are light, well aer-
ated and with good humidity from the adjacent groundwater and are easy to cultivate. The car-
bonate content in these soils varies widely and is linked to the origins of deposit.
The soil reaction is acid pH in water 5.0, which for such ozonal soils is due to chemical pollu-
tion. Their great filtration capacity is a condition leading to the possibility for quick pollution,
above all of waters. This calls for the need of special monitoring for the introduction of a sani-
tary regime.
The humus layer is between 30-50 cm thick. Its content varies between 1.5 to 6% in the virgin
soils, and I to 3% in cultivated soils.
According to their suitable for agriculture they fall in a high class - Class S1. According to their
humus content in the surface horizon they fall in Class 3 medium humus content with 60 bonitet
points, bonitet category 5, soil which are used for all types of crops in the given climate.
These features make them suitable for agriculture and vegetable production, horticulture and pas-
tures. Their high filtration capacity allows quick pollution, above all with waters and dissolved
fertilizers, pesticides, applied in agricultural production, together with pollution from transport,
industrial pollution, etc.
Forest vegetation properties Alluvian soils are suitable for some tree species, which make highly
productive river-edge forests. Under natural conditions meadow vegetation can grow, together
with water vegetation such as Festuca pratensis, Poa sylvatica, Lolliajm perenne, Plantago
lanceolata, as well as Salicaceae, Alnus glutinosa, Ulmus campestre, Populaceae etc. The high
productivity of these soils is due above all to the favorable water regime.
Gleysols (FAO, 1988)
These are soils, which have a heavy excess of water. They are found in the lowest points of the
microrelief in the area of the river banks and the drained marshes along the Danube, terrain
which have no drainage, and the zone of no movement in the river water accumulation. They are
characterized by a well-shaped genetic and morphological profile. Vegetation detritis decom-
poses slowly, and the mineral part of the soil is the place of chemical reduction processes. The
high groundwater table determines a process of transition toward gleysols along the entire depth

of the whole profile. The mechanical composition is heavy, with large grain and fine grain me-
chanical fraction prevailing. The humus horizon is always with clay and varies in thickness from
35 to 135 cm. The humus content in the upper horizons reaches about 3.70%, the nitrogen con-
tent up to 0.35%. Ilumidity is evenly spread and changes greatly at depths - on average from
31.41 to 28.33 %. Subterranean waters are highest; on average about 2.2 m to 2 m from the sur-
face throughout the drought summer period.
Marsh soils fall in the bonitet group of land not suitable for amelioration, bonitet category 10,
with a bonitet ranging from 0 to 10. When these soils are subject of complex melioration, they
can be attributed to bonitet category 6, III bonitet group - quality land.
From an ecological point of view marsh soils are a component of the richest dryland ecosystems.
With the existing water regime they are not suitable for agriculture. Amelioration greatly
changes their character and the results are frequently unfavorable.
Forest vegetation features - they have a high potential and small yield. These soils have many
nutrients in a form, which cannot be used by plants and an excess of water. Their potential can-
not be realized owing to the absence of air. With the draining of the marshes, these soils become
very fertile. Poplars and willows grow very well on the site of the former wetlands along the Da-
nube and have high productivity.
111.5.1.2. Order - soils with visible surface accumulation with basic organic material.
Vertisols (FAO, 1988,1990) - smolnitza, chernozem
Vertisols are characterized by a considerable mezo- and macro fauna (earthworms, insects, etc),
their profile has a wealth of passages, and at depths over 1,5 m in horizon C it is the place of
dwellings of small mammals, filled with material from horizon A. Their structure is from grainy
to large grain aggregate along the whole structure, has a specific form of sedimentation of hard
concretions and pseudo-mycelium.
The mechanical composition of the humus horizon is lightly sandy-clayey. It has a good struc-
ture and porosity from 64% to 46%. A regular increase in its clayey occurs from the Danube.
The humus layer is between 60 cm and 86 cm thick. The soils are rich in nutrients. Humus con-
tent is on average up to 2.53% in the horizon, N content up to 0.14%. Soil reaction varies from a
weak acid to alkaline pH >6. Vertisols have the capacity to retain humidity and have water re-
serves, which provide plants with water to the end of the summer, when irrigation is necessary.
According to their suitability for cultivation they fall in the Class high Si and good S2, erosion
control function, carbonates and deflation. According to their humus content in the surface hori-
zon they fall in Class 3 - middle humus with 7--90 bonitet points, bonitet category 2-3. These
soils are used for all types of crops in the Bulgarian climate. Vertisols are fertile soils, suitable
for the growing of wheat, barley, maize, sunflower, and pulses.
Protection of vertisols requires anti-erosion measures, crop rotation, against water erosion and
wind erosion, restoration measures and maintenance of their optimal structure, balanced use of
fertilizers.
Forest vegetation features - the high carbonate content has a negative effect on the growth of for-
ests. Soil fertility considerably in increased with the introduction of compost and other organic
fertilizer and through irrigation. The shortage of acceptable iron, suitable for the vegetation
comes from the blocking effect of calcium and is the cause of chlorosis which attacks Robin ia,
black locust (Ailanithius altissima), the hazelnut, the ash tree, the maple.
Alluvial meadow soils followed by alluvial soils and meadow swampy soils and a small amount
of carbonate vertisols occur on the territory of Kalimok-Brushlen.

The separate soils are more or less over the same area on the islands. Meadow swampy soils, ap-
proximately 38% and alluvial soils - 29%.
I1.5.2.THE EXISTING SITUATION
111.5.2.1. Belene Island
The lands on the eastern part of the island, which will be affected by the flooding, are chiefly
woods, pastures and marshes. Another parts are field and part of the infrastructure of the prison.
Also on the island there are livestock and pig farms. Pastures in the buffer zone of the reserve are
used for grazing of sheep and cows. Part of the area has been afforested with hybrid poplars,
which after reaching the necessary maturity are cut, and new plantations made. The western part
of the island of Belene has fields and artificial poplar plantations.
The report should mention that these two areas are located in recently designated protected areas.
111.5.2.2. Kalimok-Brushlen
In the past the Kalimok and Brushlen marshes were entirely flooded together with the low-lying
area around the river. The wetland zones periodically flooded marshes were 3500 ha. Generally
the area was used for fishing and livestock breathing. Draining of the Danubian marshes began
in 1952. The direct link with the Danube was cut and a system of dykes (begun as early as 1945)
and drainage canals were built. Much of the flooded land became cultivated areas. Part of the
earlier marshes remained as wetlands without a direct link with the Danube.
Fishponds, approximately 520 ha. began to build in 1981 around the Tutrakan marsh. Owing to
financial problems, fish production ceased in 1993. At present the fishponds are closed. Part of
the drained basins on the western side were cultivated, pastures are mowed, grazing of domestic
cattle is done elsewhere.
South of the eastern part of the fishponds, which effectively constitute wet meadows, end in a
marsh.
After 1990, only part of the irrigation and draining system is maintained which has led to the
abandoning of agricultural land. Part of the area around the Brushlen marsh has a soil with ex-
cessive groundwater.
The area in the region fall into several categories - arable land; abandoned fields; meadows and
pastures; forests; marshes and fens; an area occupied by canals, and roads; the terrain for fish-
ponds etc.
Ownership over the land is mixed. There is state-owned land, land which is property of the mu-
nicipality and private property.
The territory bordering on the marshes consists of private land and municipal land and is used
for agriculture. The marshes fall in the state owned land and many of them are overgrown with
reeds.
At present when the canals are being cleaned the sediments and waste products are heaped on
both sides of the canal. There is no solution of the problem where they should be deposited.
(Thus there is a need to identify a waste dump).
I.5.3.WATER REGIME OF SOILS
Flooding begins from the end of the winter period and continues to mid May - early June when
the water reaches its maximum. The zones of continuous flooding consist of:

Analytical Creative Group LTD
' A zone of continuous flooding - areas up to the 2 meter isoline measured from the mean level
of the Danube. This is characterized by the flooding during the year, which lasts for the long-
est period - throughout the vegetation period when the waters do not move or move very
slowly. This zone consists of 2 subzones:
* The first flooding subzone, which includes the area falling up to the 1 meter isoline,
measured from the mean level of the Danube. Flooding is continuous for 4-6 months and
is characterized by stagnant water in closed terrain and the slightly sloping ground of the
terrain.
* Second flooding zone, which includes the area between the first and second meter isoline,
measured from the mean level of the Danube. Flooding is continuous from 2 to 4 months.
Drainage of water is slow through the lower lying gullies in the terrain towards the river.
'rhe soils are meadow swampy, as well as transitional soils towards alluvial meadow
soils.
> A zone of flooding of medium duration - the third flooding terrace, which includes the area
between the second and third meter isoline, measured from the mean level of the Danube
falls here. Flooding lasts from one to two months. Water masses do not stay long, but are
constantly moving from the higher parts of the terrain to the lower ones. The soils are alluvial
meadow soils and in part transitions towards alluvial and meadow soils.
> The zone of brief flooding which covers the are between the three-third and fifth meter
isoline measured from the mean level of the Danube. The duration of flooding is shortest, the
water move all the time very quickly. This zone has the following subzones:
* The fourth flooding subzone, which includes the area between the +3 and +4 meter
isoline, measured from the mean level of the Danube. Flooding is for the shortest period,
1 to 2 months and water is drained very quickly.
* The fifth flooding subzone, which includes the area above the +4 meter isoline, measured
from the mean level of the Danube. For practical purposes there is no flooding here. It
only occurs at exceptionally high waters for a very short time. The terrain of the zone
consists of drained alluvial soil.
Carbonate chemozem, which is never flooded, occurs over the terrain, above the +5 meter isoline
in the peripheral parts of the river line.
Spits of small-grain sediments are deposited annually by the floodwater and are formed along the
banks of the river. When the waters withdraw they are covered with willows which increase the
area of the islands.
The areas consisting of ditches along the dyke are flooded according to their depth and the wa-
ters remain for a long period.
111.5.4. GROUNDWATER
Groundwater is a factor of importance for the habitats along the Danube. It varies as follows:
* 100-200 cm. from the surface during the drought period in the zone of continuous flood-
ing and meadow swampy soils.
* 250-300 cm. The zone of flooding of medium duration and alluvial meadow soils.
* 400-450 cm. in the zone of brief flooding and alluvial meadow soils.
No groundwater has been observed in the carbonaceous chernozem soil.

Considering the regime of soil humidity and the character of flooding, meadow swampy soils are
the most unfavorable habitat for vegetation from the point of view of ecological requirements for
fast growing water-loving tree species, especially poplars.
Habitats of plants growing on alluvial and in particular alluvial meadow soils are the most suit-
able for intensive poplar and willow forestry.
111.5.5. IRRIGATED AND DRAINED AREAS
The studied territory consists of parts of irrigation and draining systems. In order to protect the
island of Belene from high waters, dykes surround the whole island. Drainage canals and pump-
ing stations have been built in order to bring down the level of groundwater in the cultivated
lands.
Kalimok-Brushlen occupies part of the territory of the Brushlen Irrigation and Drainage System.
The plain is protected from the high waters of the Danube by the so-called Danube dykes. A sys-
tem of drainage canals and the respective pumping stations has been built for drainage. The irri-
gation of 290,935 ha. arable lands come from water pumped from the Danube.
111.6. PLANT AND ANIMAL KINGDOM, PROTECTED AREAS
II1.6.1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STATE OF DOMINANT AND THREATENED PLANT SPECIES
111.6.1.1. General characteristics - the current status
According to the forest vegetation regional planning (Zahariev et al.) the river area and the Da-
nube islands fall in the Misia forest vegetation region. Concerning vertical regional planning the
Danubian lands are at the lower end of the plains and hilly belt and in particular in the subbelt of
flood plain and riverine forests. In their nature this area consists of flood terraces, alluvial plains,
the islands on the Danube and its tributaries. Considering forest vegetation conditions beyond the
structure and the content of nutrients it is important to consider the level of subterranean waters
and the duration of flooding from the river. Ice flow in winter and landslides on the Bulgarian
side of the riverbank is one of the specific natural phenomena related to the ecological regime of
the Danubian land and vegetation.
The relief of the Bulgarian side of the riverbank along the Danube is characterized by its step-
like forms, which are gradually or steeply lower than the protection dyke towards the river. Any
considerable increase of the level of the Danube causes flooding. Many dykes have been built in
order to avoid flooding. Flooding usually begins towards the end of the winter period and con-
tinues till mid-may - beginning of June when the water level reaches its maximum. At high wa-
ters, which have flooded higher ground trees and shrubbery, serve as a buffer.
One of the consequences of periodic flooding is the shortening of the vegetation period. Usually
the development of vegetation along flooded areas begins only after the withdrawal of the wa-
ters. The continual flooding reduces productivity of tree vegetation. Even the willow (Salix
alba), the species that endures most of these conditions in the presence of frequent and continual
flooding has a slow growth, changes its habitus, making curved and irregular forms.
North American poplars are particularly sensitive to considerable flooding; they suffer in stag-
nant waters and subsequently die of various diseases on the bark, most typical of which are Do-
thichiza populea and Cvtospora crysesp. The species Pop ults x eutramericania cv which owing to
its shallow roots system and wide crown tends to incline and create changed plantations.
The basic species of the flood plain are willows, poplars, common oak, and less frequently the
ash tree, the elm (Ual{77ti(s), the wild pear (Pirus co unt711ti7is), a number of shrubs and liane spe-
cies. The most widespread and ecologically best adapted to growth conditions in these land are

the willows. The white willow (Salix alba), the almond willow (Salix triandra L) and the purple
willow (Salixppurputrea Linei) are most important. Of the poplars most characteristic is the white
poplar (Populus alba L) and the black poplar (Populus nigra L). These species successfully en-
dure the long flooding, the mechanical pressure of the water and its suppressive action. Poplars
and willows have evolved to adapt to a shortening of the vegetation period during the continuous
flooding and through compensation to speed up their growth after the water withdraws. More-
over, willows and partly poplars breed partly vegetatively which allows every organ covered by
earth to appear as a separate plant later. These specific features and some other biological quali-
ties determine them as pioneer species in the formation of the islands and the banks of the Da-
nube.
111.6.1.2. Habitats
Forest vegetation potential of habitat depends on three factors - soil, soil moisture and duration
of flooding. This was the basis of the classification of habitats along the Danube river (lands
situated at the mea continuous annual level of the Danube) in 1970.
Tvpical Danuibe willow habitat - SD4 (First ecological complex) - The typical Danube willow
habitat is situated in the zone of continuous flooding (4-6 months), overwet meadow soils, whose
state, owing to the shallow groundwater and the continuous flooding has deteriorated water and
physical properties. They include the area between the mean level and the I m isoline measured
at the mean level of the Danube;
Danuzbe willow-poplar (transitional) habitat S 3 (Second ecological complex) occur in the zone
of continuous water flooding (2-4 months). They include the lands, situated between +1 and the
2 m. isoline. The soils are marsh meadow with a transition to alluvial- meadow. The mean level
of groundwater throughout the year at a depth of 1-2 m, and during the drought period during the
summer up to 3.5 m;
Tvpical Danlube poplar habitat - D 2.3 (Third ecological complex) - The typical Danube poplar
habitat is situated between +2 m and +3 m in the zone of medium continuous flooding (1 -2
months), over alluvial-meadow soils, rich and thick. The annual average groundwater table is 2-3
m., subsiding during the summer up to 4.5 m;
Drained Daniube poplar habitat - S2 (Fourth ecological complex) - The typical Danube poplar
habitat is situated over an area between +3 m and +5 m isoline in the zone of brief flooding (up
to 1/2 a months). Soils are alluvial. The mean level of groundwater is 3-Sm falling during the
drought period to 7 m.
Typical drainied Danuiibe poplar habitat - D2 (Fifth ecological complex) - include the drained
area after the building of the protection dykes and include formerly flooded lands. They are simi-
lar to riverine habitats, however there is no flooding. Soils are marsh meadow, rich in nutrients,
and compact. During the spring groundwater are close to the surface or above it, however during
the second half of the year they fall and depend on the level of the Danube.
It has been established (Fakirov et al 1985) that in the afforested Danube river stretch 75 % of
the forest area are poplars, and 22% of natural willow forests, while only 3% are other broad-
leaved, i.e. poplar and willow occupy almost all the afforested area of flooded and drained habi-
tats.
111.6.1.3. Pioneer phytocenoses
Poplars and Willows (Salicetum et Populetum mixtum)
The origins and formations of pioneer phytocenoses of poplars and willows are connected with
the emergence of alluvial sediments over open sand banks which are periodically flooded, cov-

ered with deposits, washed away, and create conditions for the formation of a specific ecotope.
Favorable conditions emerge for thc growth of poplars and willows. In thc first year thc sedi-
ments are covered with sprouts. Only the sprouts, which survive the second flooding, can form a
plantation. Towards the third year plants in the plantation have deep roots and reach a height up
to 2.5 m, which ensures their further development and existence. After the third year natural
plantations can survive the changing regime of flooding.
Around the fifth and sixth year of the pioneer phytocenoses active differentiation of the stems
begins and in the course of years large Salix Alba L., Salix triandra L., Popilus Alba, Populus
nigra L. associations are formed.
Grass cover
A grass covcr appears on the spits before the sprouts of poplars and willows, however limited in
species and small area it covers. In the beginning there is almost no grass cover. Later, one or
two months after the formation of the sprouts pioneer species such as Gnaphaliu7n uliginosum,
(at the highest parts of the sediments) and Scirpus lacuster L., Nasturtium amphibiunm R Br.,
Scirpus michelianius L., Panicuni crus-galli L., Polygonum sp., sp. RutexRutex hIydrolapatumn
Huds., Bidens triparitus L., Raphanus raphnistrum L., etc. During the second and third year of
the life of the cenoses, regardless of the mixing of tree species, there occurs a rapid increase of
individual Scirpus michelianis L. and Scirpus lacuster L.
111.6.1.4. Plant communities
Saliceta Plant communities
Saliceta Plant communities are most common. The cenoses of these cenoses are basic for flood
land, 63% of hem are young and reaching maturity. Their main species is Salix alba L. It is the
dominant species in the cenoses and forms the first floor. Salix trianidra L. occurs everywhere.
With time the participation of Salix triandra L. continues decreases and after reaching 10 years
they no longer remain. Salix alba L. and Salix triandra L., sustain continuous flooding best,
hence their greater distribution.
Salix triandra L., and Salix purpuirea L., are in some case confectors with their forms, in others
assectators, i.e. they are accompany the plant community, or a regular elements, however not
dominant species in willow communities.
Shrubs and semi-shrubs, associated in willow communities are represented chiefly by Rubus
caeisus L., Amorphafruticosa L., Crataegus ionioginia L., Cronius sanguinea L., Viburnlum opu-
lus L., Ligustrum vulkgare L. Evonymus europaeus L., Tamarix pallasii Desv. and to a small ex-
tent Rhamnlusfrangula L., which are spread out among the community. This vegetation forms
the synusia, the second floor in the cenoses. The quantities of the species vary.
Grammineous vegetation is varied and typical for flood lands. These are chiefly resistant species,
sustaining continuous flooding, heavy soils, with heavy humidity of dry sands. The typical forest
grammineous species are absent. Grasses usually for low, relatively thick, frequently thinned
ground floor or a higher and thinner second floor with a height up to 1.0-1.5 m.
Scirpus lacuster L., Nasturtium amphibium R.Br., Scirpus michalianius L., Panicumz cris-galli L.,
Polygonum sp., Typha sp., Rumex hiydrolapatumn Huds, Bidens tripartitus L., Salanuam ducamnara
L., Raphanus raphanistruim1 L., Carex acutiformis Ehrlh., Lysimachia vulgaris L., Calamagrostris
epigeios L., Menttha aqautica L., Agrostis alba L., Euphorbia palustris L., Phragmites communis
Trin., Clieniopodiumn polyspermum L., Althea offcinalis L., Urtica dioica L., Cyperus glomtieratus
L. etc are typicalfor the Saliceta formationis.

Salicetum albae plant communities
Salicetum albae is a quick growing species, which occupies rivers banks and low marshy land. It
is not demanding, however it prefers marshy land and fertile sand-clayey and clay-alluvial soils.
Salicetuml albae can live up to 80-100 years.
The lower limit of distribution of the white willow is at -0.6 to + 0.4 meters, which means that it
is around the average level of the water. If the sprouts survive the first and second year, the for-
mation of pioneer phytocenoseses of poplars and willow begins and after the sixth year the initial
phase of development and formation of white willow communities.
With time habitats rise which leads to a change in the floristic composition of phytocenoseses
and the associations of white willow. They assume the following ecologo-cenotic order:
> Salicetum albae et triandrae juvenilum association
* Salicetuni albae nuduxm nasturtiosa - crypsidosum
* Salicetuem  albae rubosum (variants with Polygonui 1hydropiper and Urticc dioica)
association
* Salicetum albae amorphosum (fruticosa) association.
Specific features of the willow associations - a relatively brief existence of the communities and
close link with the habitat. These communities have a protective function as they occupy the
banks of the islands, protect the bank from being washed away and destroyed.
The formations of flood forests of Salix alba are very important for the economy. They not only
are a source of timber, but they performn many specific social, landscape, flood water retention
and anti-erosion functions for the banks. They are also of major importance as biodiversity habi-
tats.
Populeta plant communities
Today populeta plant communities are less frequent. Many of them were cut and uprooted. Only
Populus nigra L and Populus alba L exist in small copses. In the internal flood forests they occur
most often in groups among natural willow dendrocenoseses. The following type of natural pop-
lar communities occur:
Populetum nigrae Rubosum
Popiletuml nigrae Ruibosum occupies Danubian habitats of willows and poplars situated between
the +1 and +2 meter isoline mean annual level of the Danube. They develop over wet layer
meadow swampy soils moving towards alluvial meadow soils. In the composition of the tree
floor PoptulZus nigra prevails mixed with Salix alba L and Populus alba L. The species endures
continuous flooding.
Robus caesius L. form a low floor of shrubbery with a constant cover. Separate individuals of
Cornus sanguiinea L. Evonzymus europeus L., Viburnum opulus L., also occur. The grammineus
floor consists of Elytrigia repens L., Calamagrostis epigeios Roth., Artemisia vulgaris L., Equi-
setum arvense L., Aegopodium podagraria L., and others.
Populetum albae rubosum
Populuis alba L. prevails in the cenoses, appearing in the higher parts, where the water stays for a
shorter period. The participation of Pop ulus nigra L. and Salix alba L. is limited. Separate indi-
viduals of Pvrus commnunis L., Quercus robuir L., Alnuls glutinosa Gaertner, also occur, some-
time forming a partially formed second floor. Cornius saniguinea L. dominates in the shrubs floor.

Evonymiius europeus L., Viburnumn opulus L., Crategus sp,. Acer tataricum L., also fall here. Of
the creepers in this type, forest Hum ulusupullls L., and Vitis solvestris Gmel are also found.
111.6.1.5. BeleneIsland
The project includes the restoration of the wetlands over the eastern parts of the island of Belene
- the part of the Persinsky Marshes Reserve. These wetlands were determined for restoration on
the basis of their potential to capture nutrients and their value as a natural environment for bio-
logical diversity.
The island is 14.5 km long and in area over 45 sq.km. Three large connected wetlands are situ-
ated in its interior - Martvoto, Peschina, Doulyova bara, while in the lower lying eastern part of
the island is the Persina-Iztok nature site. At its western end a common channel drains into the
Danube. They are I - 2.5 m deep, and during the summer parts of them dry up. The bottoms are
filled with silt.
Belene is characterized by tree vegetation and shrubs, Salix alba L., Sali.r trriandra L., and Salix
purpurea being of primary importance. Of the poplars typical are Populus alba L., and Plopulus
nigra L.
The Salicetum albae rubosum association is a Climax association, occupying the eastern part of
the island. In most cases this stage is degraded, which has not yet reached its phase of climax and
is represented by associations (Salicitum euphorbiosa-rubosum), with prevalence in the under-
growth Euphorbia lucida, Rubus caesius, and Salicetu7n altoherbosumn, where Rubus caesius has
a secondary role, and various grammineus plants prevail.
A large part of the island is covered with Agrostis alba and Cydonum dactilon in the highest
parts of the island and Sirpus michelianuts.
A small forest of Salix alba, without undergrowth Salicetumiz albae nudumii is situated near the Pe-
schina marsh, while in the northern section of Martvoto blato - the association Salicetuni pur-
pureae; on the parts along the banks of the island - there are dense growths of Salicetum trian-
drae.
The vegetation of the marshes is quite specific. The banks are overgrown with Tvpha latifolia,
Sparganiuim ramosurn, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Sagitaria sagifolia, Butomus umbelatus etc.
Typical marsh communities develop in the marshes
The cenoses of Azollafiliculoides are typical for Martvoto blato, together with the association of
Myriophyllum. The association is over a comparatively large area (0.8 - 1 ha). The composition
of the association is built on a comparatively small number of plants - Salvina nlatatls, Pota-
niogetoni pectinatus, Potamogeton crispus, Trapa natas, Nympgoidesflava, Lemnra minor,
Myriophlylluttnz vertililaturn, Ceratophvllumn detnersumn, Nayas inini or.
Other typical wetland communities develop, incl. that of Nymphaea alba, the marsh of Dyulova
bara being the largest site of the community. The formation of Nyphiur lutea is developed in
Martvoto blato, Potomogetoni natatns in deeper parts, together with Nympgoidesflava and Trapa
natas in the shallower parts.
The association of Oenanathe aquatica has been studied in Peschinsko blato marsh with an area
of 3.8 acres. The cenoses occupy the peripheral part of the marsh. Together with Oenanthe
aquatica, with smaller numbers, or separate individuals of Sium latifolium, Butomnus u7mbellatus,
Salvitia natas, LIemnia rintor, etc. also are found here. The rare fern Afarsilea quadrifolia grows
in Peschina.
Agricultural areas occupy the western part of the island.

Marsh vegetation
Marsh vegetation, described in 12 associations, occurs chiefly in the Martvoto blato marsh. (Ko-
chev, Yordanov, 1981).
Some of them consist only of rare or threatened species Nyphaea alba L., Nuphar lutea L., Trapa
natas,L., Nymphoidesflava. Besides these species Marsilea quadrifolia, together with Valisnieria
spiralis, the water ferns Azollafiuliculoides, Azolla caroliniana, Salvinie natans. Underwater
vegetation is represented by a mixed community - Potamogetonifruitans, Ceratoplhylllur demer-
sum, Potamogeton trichoides. Potaniogeton crispus, Pfluitans, P.pectinatus and other also oc-
cur.
Today the whole complex of marsh species has been destroyed or is very degraded.
The association of Trapa natans is almost completely lost; the species Nuphar lutea L., Ny7n-
phaea alba L., Marsilea quadrifolia, Valisnieria spiralis are almost extinct.
Martvoto blato marsh is no longer a permanent marsh, but a periodically flooded territory, with
different periods of drought.
Dyulova bara marsh is practically non-existent, only small ponds remain.
The Peschina marsh is overgrown by Typha aiugustifolia, Pltrag7nites atistralis, and Shoenoplec-
tus lacustris. A small cenosis exists of Nymphoidesflava in the open water area.
111.6.1.6. Kalimok-Brushlen
In the past the Tutrakan floodplain was 25 km long and 2-3 km wide. The Danube and the
Tarchil (Maratin) rivers, which run through the middle of the plain to the northwest, played an
important part in its drainage. Throughout the spring flooding, besides draining, it also deposited
sediments over large parts of the plain. The lowest parts of the wetland or floodplain were in the
western and eastern ends, where there were larger open water surfaces known as the Brushlen
marsh (in the west) and the Belitsa marsh or otherwise known as Kalimok in the east.
In the 50s they were drained, together with almost all other marshes along the Danube. Kalimok
was turned into a fishpond - one of the largest in Bulgaria. It retained its role as a wetland in
spite this, for instance the former Brushlen marsh, in spite of it being drained, has very high
groundwater. In the spring they cause flooding, and practically the central part is the deepest one,
with large beds of reed and cattail. Besides that this area is not suitable for agricultural activity,
its nature conservation value has been impaired.
The largest areas on the plain are occupied by the communities of reeds and cattail, the surface
of the marshes are covered by various hydrophite phytocenoses such as that of Nvimphea alba,
Trapa niatas, Nymphoides peltata.
Although they are situated in the same floodplain, the two marshes are far from one another and
have their characteristic features.
Kalimok marsh
The main wetland habitats preserved are the areas of the abandoned fishponds. Almost their en-
tire surface is covered with marsh vegetation with several prevalent species: Typha augustifolia,
Typha latifolia, Typha laxmani, together with Schoenplectus laciusttris, while the banks of the
basins and the dykes are overgrown by Phraginites aufstralis. In the open water area the follow-
ing species are most common: Hvdrocharis morsius ranae. Nympphae alba, Nympphoides peltata,
Trapa natans etc. Along the banks of the drainage canals, besides the reed massifs, at separate
locations it is overgrown with willows (Salix sp.). various types of sour grasses grow on the

meadows, and at the periphery Schoenoplectus litoralis. The territory between the fisheries and
the river constitutes a flooded forest of willows (Salix sp) with a rich undergrowth of climbers
and temporary water bodies. Besides Nympphae alba, there seven other species included in Bul-
garia's Red Data Book (1984) occur in the wetland area: Urticularia vulgaris, Marsilea quardri-
folia, Nutphar lutea, etc. (Koutsarov et al. 1997).
Canals are also suitable for water vegetation. A large part of them were until recently covered
with phytocenoses of Nymphaea alba, however part of the community was destroyed with the
cleaning of the canal.
The functioning of the fishponds and the maintenance of the fish pond facilities, together with
climatic change brought to the quick degradation of these water bodies. Only for several years
the ponds were overgrown with reed and cattails, and some willows have spread. At present the
greater part of the region represents large reed beds and mass of cat's tails.
Brushlen marsh
In the past it had a bigger open water body although the open water body was smaller than the
Kalimok marsh. In the periphery there were large reed massifs, which are now turned into arable
land and low-grade pastures, frequently flooded in spring. In the deepest parts, in spite of the
presence of drainage canals, residual water remains to the end of the summer, together with
dense marsh vegetation - reeds and cat's tails.
The land around the marsh is practically not suited for agriculture.
111.6.1.7. Species included Bulgaria's Red Data Book
Bulgaria's Red Data Book includes the following species,
Isolepis supine L, family Cyperaceae; a threatened species, Belene, Allium anulosum L., Lili-
aceae, a rare species, along wetlands along the Danube, Corispemum marschalli Stev., Chenopo-
diaceae, a rare species of the group of islands around Belene; Nuphas lutea L., Nymphaeaceae, a

nubialis Vel., Fabaccae, a rare species, Kalimok-Brushlen, Trapa natans L., Trapaccac, rare Ter-
tiary relict, Belene, Nymphoides peltta S.G.Gmel.), Gentianaceae, a rare species, Callitriche
stagnalis Scop., a rare species along the Danube, Callitrichaceae, Utricularia vulgaris L., Lenti-
bulariaceae, a rare species, a rare species, in marshes, and slow running waters., Senecio paludo-
sus L., Asteraceae, a rare species along the Danube.
111.6.1.8. Resources
At present people living the plain collect fish, snails and some herbs such as Symlphytum offici-
tiale L., Althea officinalis L.. With the restoration of the wetlands, some of the sites will be de-
stroyed, however new sites will be created and the general availability of the economic resources
(herbs, snails, and game) will increase. Stable populations could be ensured for many moisture
loving herbs such as Mentha aquatica, M. longifolia, Synmplhytumit officinale L, Urtica dioica,
Samnbuclsebulus, Iris pseudocorus, Galium verum, Gratiola officinalis, Valeriana officinialis,
Oreganunm vulgare, Hydrocharis 7norsus-ranae, Malva svlvestris, Sambuccus nigra, Persicaria
hvdropiper, Rorrpa sylvestris. The enormous quantities of reeds in the floodplains are also a re-
source, which should be used. Chiefly small dairy farmers use part of the sour grass for fodder.
The use of these resources should be regulated and limited. The use of game resources should
also be subject to control. The population of some animals - jackals, wild boar, hooded crows
should be regulated, as at present their numbers are too high and they are a threat for rare and
threatened species. The legislation for the regulation of protected areas should be respected.

In the future better use could be made of resources such as frogs, reeds, floating water vegeta-
tion, and zooplankton.
In the course of construction work many of the habitats would be destroyed. Vegetation is a
flexible material and under favorable conditions it will be restored quickly.
111.6.2.CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SITUATION OF THREATENED SPECIES. A PROGNOSIS AND AS-
SESSMENT OF DOMINANT SPECIES
111.6.2.1. Belene Island
The existence of preserved and generally unaffected plant formations, as well as the existence of
marshes determines the formation of a specific and varied fauna. A number of representatives of
invertebrate fauna are found here, such as Apus cancriformis, which develop early in spring in
shallow flooded areas. Ichtyofauna is varied.
The following rare amphibians in Bulgaria have been observed in the restoration area: Pelobates
syriacus balcanicus, Triturus cristatus, and the reptiles, where two types of water snake prevail
Natrix natrix and Natrix tessellata.
The importance of Belene as an ornithological site is exceptional. Of the 104 bird species estab-
lished here, 21 are included in Bulgaria's Red Data Book, 44 are species of European signifi-
cance (SPEC) (Tucker, Heath, 1994) and 3 species are included in SPEC 1, 7 in category' SPEC2,
16 species -SPEC3 and 18 species in category SPEC4.
Marshes in the island are among the few nesting sites of the pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax
pygmeus), the spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia), Aniser aniser, Netta rufina, Aniser strepera, Anas
querquedula, Anias clvpeata, Aytlhya niiroca, Aythlyaferinia etc. (Ivanov, 1993). According to the
author the first two species plus the shiny Ibis (Plegadisfalcinellus) have not been established as
nesting for Bulgaria. The island is an important habitat for the sea eagle (Haliaestius albicilla),
and the colonies of cranes are among the largest in Bulgaria. The main species are: Ardeola ral-
loides, Egretta garzetta, Nycticorax nycticorax. Smaller numbers are nesting of Ardea purpurea,
Ardea cinerea etc. Occasional colonies exist of the Great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo. Clhli-
donia hiybrida nests on the leaves of water lilies, and less frequently Larus ridibundus. It is here
that Podiceps griseigena has its largest colony in Bulgaria. During the autumn migration (pro-
vided the marshes have not dried out), there are considerable concentrations of black storks (Ci-
conia niigra). Small numbers of Crex crex, which is a threatened species nest here. During migra-
tions this is the place to see Acrocephalus paludicola. Some raptors nest in the willows (Bubo
bubo, Strix aluico).
The region has its specific fauna of mammals: Capreolus capreolius, Mustela nivalis, Vulpes vull-
pes, a great variety of rodents Rodenitia etc, There have been recent reports of jackal (Can is
aureus) and large numbers of wild boar (Sits scrofa).
111.6.2.2. Kalimok Brushlen
Kalimok station to the Zoological Institute to the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences began to oper-
ate effectively in 1994. The principal focus of its activities was problems related to the local bird
fauna and partially to the flora and Lepidoptera. NGOs and amateur bird environmentalists ef-
fected monitoring in the wetland. So far, the following groups were studied in detail: aniphibia -
100 %; birds - 95 %, fishes - 80 %, mammals - 60 %. The flora was studied to about 60 %.
Status of environmental protection: Ramsar Convention; Bern Convention, Bulgarian Red Book;
IUSN Red List; Corine Site. Birds are the largest group of fauna having environmental protec-
tion status.

According to the studies of Koutsarov, Zehtindjiev, Yankov, Marinov and Kourtev (1997), the
Kalimok fishponds are some of the internationally significant habitats for waterfowls. 183 bird
species were found on its territory. 60 of them are included in the Bulgarian Red Book, and 103
are species of European conservation importance (Koutsarov et al., 1997), (SPEC) (Tucker,
Heath, 1994) and 4 species are classified under SPEC 1 class, 12 - under SPEC2; 3 under SPEC3,
and 35 under SPEFC4.
These territories are of worldwide significance for Aythya nyroca and as a place for rest for the
pelican Pelecanuls crispus, and during the winter season and the time of migration - also for the
small cormorant Phalacrocorax pygmeus, Anser anser. They are also the locations for wintering
of Turdus pilaris. Big concentrations of several species of water loving birds, including Branta
rzficollis, Anser Albifronis, etc. (Koutsarov et al., 1997) can be seen in the winter season.
During the period of nesting, the following bird species can be observed: Ixobrychus minutus,
Nycticorax nycticorax, Platalea leucorodia, Coturnix coturnix, Cordicas garrulus. Greatest is
the number of the following bird species: Chlidonias hybridus - 20-450 pairs;) Coturnix coturnix
- 40 - 100 pairs; Nyctocorax nycticorax - 30 - 50 pairs. According to (Koutsarov et al., 1997), the
area is a characteristic base for one pair of Haliaeetus albicilla too.
During the period of migration, most numerous bird species are: Ciconia ciconia- 10,000 -
15,000 birds, Nycticorax nycticorax, - 100 - 750, Plegadisfalcinnzelluts - 300 - 500 birds, Pla-
talea leucorodia, - 14 - 100 birds, Plhalacrocoraxpygmeus - 3 - 220 birds.
Most numerous wintering species are: big white goose - Anser albifrons - 3000 - 5000 birds;
Turduspilaris - 500 - 200 birds; Anser anser - 300 - 500 birds, Branta ruficollis - 120 - 200
birds.
Four of the mammal species occurring in the fishponds are included in the Red Book of Bul-
garia: Ptungitus platygaster, Pelebates syriactus balcanicuts, Lutra lutra, Vormela peregusna, and
the medical leech - the biggest population in Bulgaria.

In December 1952 - 3 years from the dredging of the Srebuma lake and from the complete ter-
mination of the connection to the Danube, with an area of approximately 200 ha. - a new fishing
test had been made with the results that 1,960.2 kg of fish had been caught in ten full working
days using a net (unfortunately, no data such as net selectivity, length and size are available).
With some assumptions (the taking into account of the catch decline curve, the fact that fishing
had been banned in the lake, the winter etc.), an approximation is possible to the effect that the
annual catches would amount to 6 - 7 tons or 0.3-0.4 kg/ha, which is 50 - 60% of the catches in
1942, and in view of the fact that the main species (approximately 80%) are now small-size spe-
cies of low value, it can be said that the Sreburna lake has lost its fishing significance completely
in ten year's time.
No integrated studies for the fish-breeding capacity in the Sreburna reserve have been made dur-
ing the recent years.

According to information provided by Ivan Todorov, a fisherman from Belene, some of the peo-
ple maintained and caught fish in the so-called "fisheries" of Belene, and during the 1980s
(1982-1984) they caught 35 tons of fish (total catch) basically carp and pike, and individual sheat
fishes and tench. Only large fish was caught, while the small fishes (mainly Rudd, and possibly)
were left to the herons, and this fact might serve as an indication that the entire catch has been 34
tons. Data on fish productivity in some coastal wetlands show similar figures to those along the
river Danube.
The fish productivity in the Mandra Lake from eleven years (from 1946 till 1956) showed an av-
erage catch of 172.5 annual tons. For an area of 1082 ha at that time, that makes 1.594 kg/ha.
One should remember, however, that 33 % of the total amount caught was of Gray mullet of
0.526 kg/ha, which is a species migrating in the sea. Without migrating species the amount is
1.068 kg/ha.
The catch from the lake of Bourgas (Vaya), which in the past was a brackish lake but after hu-
man regulation has now become a freshwater wetland, was 1.087 kg/ha on the average in 1999,
and this is the actual productivity of a seacoast marsh without migrating species.
It is not recommendable to compare with internal water reservoirs and fish ponds (even along the
Danube River) because the results could be very misleading: a large part of the reservoirs are
very deep and belong to other types of ecosystems, and fish there is frequently bred artificially.
Therefore such fish ponds cannot be used for comparison as food and fish stocks are nol. intro-
duced in a natural way, the efforts for the catch are less strenuous, and a greater amount than
normally is caught.
111.7.1.FoRECAST ON FISH PRODUCTIVITY AND ICHTHYOFAUNA COMPOSITION
The species composition of the ichthyofauna in the restored marshes does not depend or is de-
pendable only to a small extent on their area (within the limits according to the different scenar-
ios), the productivity of an unit area is also dependable on a more intensive exchange and flow of
water from the Danube. The main determining factor is the link with the main water source - the
Danube, namely:
* At how many places will the dyke be cut, what length, width and depth. The variant of
destroying the dyke does not exist.
 The sluice regime: how long will they be open and throughout which season. The variant
of removing the sluices does not exist.
* What kind of water regime will be maintained: would the marshes be allowed to dry up?
III.7.1.1. Belene Island
Owing to the close proximity of the river to the marshes there are excellent conditions for the en-
try of fish in the marshes. If a favorable hydrological regime is maintained, fish productivity may
reach up to 40 kg/acre. Carp, catfish and pike are the dominant species. Species variety could be
richer than that at Kalimok-Brushlen owing more to the chance for species to come from the Da-
nube. Probably the number of species will range between 25 and 27. At present the wetland has
no fish fauna of its own, so future fauna would be formed mainly of species coming from the
Danube. In this way the typical wetland species would be restored very slowly following a natu-
ral process. So perhaps it would be necessary to introduce fish artificially - golden carp.
111.7.1.2. Kalimok Brushlen
In the presence of a wide opening and connection, as early as the first year carp, catfish., pike
would come in. Nevertheless it would be necessary to have an open connection between the Da-
nube and the wetland for at least 2 or 3 months during the breeding period. It would be best if the

wetland is linked with the Danube at least two places and the canal should be as short as possible
and as wide as possible. This should be done to avoid the unnecessary presence of poachers,
movement of people and work with machines. In this case fish productivity of the wetland can
reach up to 32 kg/acre; naturally full productivity should be expected between 5 and 10 years af-
ter flooding when the fish fauna will be established. It would be good if for the first 3 years no
fishing is allowed, so that the restoration process would take the correct course. Species compo-
sition would be approximately 20-25 species. The prevailing species would be the valuable carp,
pike, and probably catfish. The state of the population of the weather fish, nine-spined stickle-
back, and golden carp should be expected to be good.
It is only under these conditions and with this variant that fish resources would be sufficient to
justify the organizing of fishing cooperative. The matter is discussed in the section on fisheries.
In the absence of a direct link or the opening of such a link in an unsuitable period (June-March)
or if hydrotechnical facilities of the canal pumps, the height of the sluices are not properly
planned fish fauna will be very poor and close to that which exists at the present moment. In this
case what could happen could be that we would find ourselves of the situation of Sreburna in
1952. The production rate would be 0.3-0.4 kg/ha for species of low economic value, the domi-
nant species would be white beam and goldfish, with massive spreading of roach and stone mo-
rocco, and perhaps the only economically valuable species would be pike. The rare golden carp
and the nine-spined stickleback would disappear, while the population of the weather fish would
be very low. The species composition would be about 15 spccies in a markedly unbalanced situa-
tion with the overdomination of one or two species.
In this case the formation of a fishing co-operation will not be profitable.
111.7.2. SUGGESTIONS OF FLOODING PERIODS
It is necessary to mention that the first or second year the restored wetlands will not realize their
full nutrient removal capacity because of the potential biodegradation of existing terrestrial vege-
tation. It is possible the total nutrient levels of the project area to remain stable or even a little bit
increasing. In fact a real nutrient reduction may be expected at the beginning of the third year un-
til the ecosystem will stay in a very specific dynamic equilibrium.
That process will intensify unless the reed is mowed down, taken out and becomes flooded be-
fore it sprouts. Furthermore, the process of the natural succession of wetlands will become faster
which will inevitably require quick intervention for their hollowing out.

* The reed should be taken out and be flooded before it sprouts. In order to stop the sprout-
ing of reed the water-body should be at least 120 cm. deep, below that depth the reed
grows unhindered.
* No drying up should be allowed in either of the two project areas, which despite being a
natural process has an extremely unfavorable effect on the local ichthyofauna. Even if the
locks are closed when the Danube is low by means of the hydraulic connection, the water
will infiltrate through the sandy soil and disappear- the only solution is to dig out artifi-
cially channel-like ditches in the lowest part of the island, the depth of which will corre-
spond to the lowest levels of the Danube in order to guarantee even during the greatest
drought the survival of typical inhabitants of stagnant waters, the restoration of which
from the Danube is difficult and depends on accidental factors.
* Free access of the fish to the wetlands should be provided during the highest waters when
it spawns, otherwise their significance as spawning sites for the Danubian types of spe-
cies will be compromised.
* The fish should be given the opportunity to withdraw to the Danube at the end of autumn.
The wetlands do not offer condition for the fish to spend the winter - most of them will
completely freeze for two months.
* It should be investigated whether during the flooding and the subsequent decornposition,
the abundant and rich in allelopathic compounds Indigo plant (Amllorphafrulticosa) on the
island of Belene and in Kalimok-Brushlen might release poisonous substances into the
water. If there is such a possibility, it should be mechanically eliminated before each
flooding.

Special investigation about fishing and the species on Belene Island has not been carried out.
During the expedition only a Crucian Carp (Carassius gibelio) was caught and two representa-
tives of Leucaspius delineatus only in the canal collecting drainage waters. The marshes were
entirely dried out, and there was water only in the deepest parts of the collecting drainage chan-
nel. There was no water in the "Guard". Dominant species - the silver carp.

111.7.5. FISHING
111.7.5.1. Description of the existing destructive fishing practices in the area
Fishing is almost not practiced in the existing wetlands. Mainly amateurs with sports fishing rods
go fishing. Fishing is not among the factors, which presently threaten the ichthyofauna or are in-
fluencing it somehow; the reason is in the lack or the small quantity of types of objects of fish-
ing. In case of a "zero" restoration scenario fishing will diminish even more its negative influ-
ence after the disappearance of the few remaining species of economic significance which occur
nowadays.
The negative practices spread among fishermen in neighboring water-bodies (mainly the Da-
nube) are fishing during the closed season, fishing with trawls, catching undersized fish, fishing
with explosives. Due to the lack of data for the stock of fish it cannot be claimed that there is an
extreme overfishing, especially considering the small catch fishermen have had in recent years.
Those fishing practices in the Danube have been mentioned as far as it is possible to transfer
them to the restored water-bodies, although fishing in lake or marsh conditions is quite different
from that in the Danube.
fishing with trawls - it is used only in the conditions of the Danube by catching big rheo-
phil species mainly sturgeon, which do not occur in marshes - it is not a threat for the re-
stored marshes.
Environmental Assessment                                                             48

* explosives - in the conditions of the shallow wetland, fishing with explosives is ineffec-
tive and extremely dangerous - it is not a threat for the restored marshes
* catching undersized fish - a real danger
* fishing during the closed season - a real danger
* extremely great catch - a real danger
These practices have been discussed on condition that the restored wetlands are intended to be
treated as ecosystems with sustainable development of their resources. If no utilization of the re-
sources is intended and the system functions as a strict reserve in which all human intervention
are prohibited, then all fishing practices are prohibited as having a negative influence.

The number of fishermen with issued licenses for commercial fishing in the Danube has been
decreasing during the last three years in consequence of the drastic decrease of the fish stocks.
One fisherman from the Danubian area Svishtov-Tutrakan for the six-year period declares an av-
erage of 331 kg of fish yearly / 0.852 kg monthly. According to inquired fishermen the average
catch amounts to 3-4 kg of fish which means that the average number of fishing days in the year
is 94. These data are quite below the real ones because the fishermen are afraid to put down eve-
rything because they think they will be taxed for it afterwards. The real catch of fish is probably
about twice as big. Even for such a short period (5 years) there is a clearly marked trend for de-
crease of the catch, the number of fishermen and the significance of fishing as a means of living.
A great number of the fishermen are willing to give up fishing if they have an alternative occupa-
tion. All fishermen share the opinion that the restoration of the wetlands will increase the amount
of fish in the river Danube and most of all that of the carp. In the conversations very few of them
assumed that they could catch fish in the wetlands.
111.7.6.REsToRATtON OF THE WETLANDS
The restored wetlands will not influence the numbers of sturgeon since it is a typical rheophil
species and inhabits, during all stages of its life, only running waters, it is possible only that oc-
casionally young single representatives will enter the wetlands.
The complete drying out of the wetlands even for a short period of time will have an extremely
negative influence on the ichthyofauna in both project areas, it is necessary to provide an option
with canals or artificially dug out strips, though not being very large, in which the typical wet-
land species will be preserved, which would be difficult to restore from the river Danube.
At the average depth of 0.35-0.45 m of both areas and the maintenance of that level for about a
month and a half their main function will be the breeding of species (that is the supposition of
the local fishermen) spawning caviar on plant residues or the entire flooded vegetation (mainly
carp, carp bream, to some extent sheat-fish out of the economically valuable species). If the wet-
lands do not have open water surfaces, fishing will be impossible and the only option is "on
guard" fishing at the outlets, of fish leaving the wetland and returning to the Danube. In such
conditions it is necessary to secure the unobstructed return of the larvae to the wetlands Espe-
cially in the English text, this needs explanation, e.g. (please correct if necessary):
Environmental Assessment                                                             50

The "guard" is at the outlet of the wetland, where a metal grid with large openings can be placed,
capturing only the largest fish but letting the smaller ones freely through. This was a typical way
of fishing e.g. at Belene Island in the past.
The Brushlen marsh should not be excluded from restoration.
The numbers of tritons (larvae) at the beginning of August is for the small triton - 4 spec./m2 and
2spec/m2 of the Danubian triton (Trituruis dobrogicus). The former bed of the river Tarchil is the
place with greatest number of tritons.
There is a certain risk for the larvae of the breeding species of being infected by Postodiplosto-
mosis caused by Plostodiplostomus cuticola, it turns out that the infection of some small species
(Leucaspius delinieatus) is almost 100% (especially in Kalimok-Brushlen). The parasite has one
more intermediate host - small helixes, and final hosts are herons and other floundering fish-
feeding birds. A mass invasion could lead to mortality of the larvae. No medical treatment or
prevention methods are known.
111.8. CHARACTERISTICS OF PROTECTED AREAS
The protected areas subject of this investigation fall into the Danubian lowland area. That area is
one of the most anthropogenised areas in our country with a limited possibility for the develop-
ment of conservative protection of nature.
111.8.1. "BELENE ISLANDS" COMPLEX
International ecological status - the site is a part of a CORYNE Biotope Site
National ecological status Nature Park
Reserves: Order N: 1106 KOPS /02.12.1981 "Persinsky Blata" - 385.2 hectares with buffer area
- 551 hectares
Natural sights: "Persina Iztok" - 718.9 hectares
The Persinsky Blata reserve belongs to the Belene island group. It includes the freshwater
marshes Peschina (182 hectares), Martvoto (122,6 hectares), Staroto Blato and Doulyova Bara
(80.6 hectares), the surrounding floodplain forests as well as the neighboring islands of Kitka
and Milka. The buffer area is 551.3 hectares. The meadows in the buffer area of the reserve are
used for pastures of sheep and cows. Sylviculture is available - part of the area is afforested with
hybrid poplars which are regularly changed. The northern part of the island is occupied with ag-
ricultural areas and artificial plantation of poplars. Hunting is practiced, international hunting
tourism included.
The significance of the reserve's territory with regard to the flora and fauna has been discussed
above.
Meanwhile, in immediate proximity to Persinsky Blata - on the island of the same name is the
Kitka reserve (24.5 hectares), created to protect the original peculiar vegetation as well as the
habitat of the white-tailed eagle which is characteristic of our country.
Towards the end of the 40s Milka Island was also proclaimed a reserve, and it is situated in the
same group of islands. Abandoned as a reserve it is again included in the list of protected natural
areas.
The island of Belene has a special status. Within the boundaries of the reserve certain activities
are forbidden that they are enumerated in the Protected Areas Law.

Nowadays, from a geoecological point of view it is very important to take into account the im-
pact of the anthropogenic factor. The maximum man-influenced geological components in the
area are animal life, vegetation, soils and water.
On the other hand, the basic landscape type is divided into: urban landscape, which is character-
ized by its engineering and technical infrastructure, agricultural landscape, water, river, and riv-
erside landscapes, forest landscapes. The special-purpose landscapes - protected nature areas and
the urban landscape, were designated.
III.9.1.AQUATIC LANDSCAPE
The different elements of the riverside area with a dominant natural element the river Danube,
are mutually related, and form the basic structure and scale division of the riverside landscape,
and they also determine its division into natural sections with varying ecological conditions. The
main landscape and ecological features of this type of landscape (according to prof. Robev,
1989) amount to the following: unity of the river system, high dynamics and instability of the
separate ecosystems within the range of the water currents for more limited time spans; actively
visible water exchange between the atmospheric, intrasoil and underground waters horizontally
as well as vertically, which in turn increases the self-purification capacity of shallow waters, a
process of accumulation of riverside terrain waters in the alluvial cones, seasonal periodical ex-
hibiting of water exchange, possibility, when necessary, to draw on the accumulated under-
ground waters, swamping of the low floodplains.
A high floods terrace characterizes the riverside sector, it has a hydrophilic vegetation shelterbelt
- mostly willows (Salix) and poplars (Populus). Behind the dyke is found the easement strip, and
behind it - agricultural areas and meadows. Behind the dyke are found the wetlands as well - in-
cluding the Kalimok-Brushlen complex and the Belene Island wetlands.
These special status areas (wetlands as protected areas) are part of the urban development areas
in the preliminary planned terrain in accordance with the requirements of the Protected .Areas
Law. Enlargement of such an area would have to conform to the specific requirements of the ar-
eas with the main purpose of preserving biodiversity and the habitats of rare species of plants,
birds and other animals, also preserving the specific landscape, all the time taking into account
the forecasts of the urban development plans, with the existence and location of the high-fertility
lands, forest and perennial crops, with the transferred land property, and the variation oi the
habitation standard requirements.
Riverside areas construction work is based on large scale landscape elements - large forest mas-
sif areas, meadows, open areas, marshland areas and cultivated land. There are areas where par-
ticular nature friendly project variants can be developed, which could contribute to biodiversity
enrichment, and would also have aesthetic impact on the riverside landscape. Good results are
achieved when technical projects and planning are combined and completed by biological con-
struction methods.
Water canials - these appear to be a frequent cause for the occurrence of ecological and aesthetic
problems of the landscape. The basic requirements of the purposes set have to be complied with:
appropriate maintenance of the land around the canal, availing some of the area for the needs of
the wetlands, creation of new flora and fauna biotopes.
According to the ecological landscape design principlcs most attractive are such areas as are
natural and situated freely in the landscape, thus forming rich and diverse habitats.
Since the construction of water canal is in fact man's interference with the environment, the re-
quirements for the overall scenery variety must be complied with, meanwhile trying to preserve
some of the specific character and features of the original landscape, which can be achieved in

several ways: roper tracing of the water canal, whenever possible - constructing the chainels by
excavation, utilization of the excavation works for the strengthening of the banks and following
the natural terrain shapes configuration; also planting of suitable vegetation with consideration to
biological diversity and decorative and spatial volume; also procuring the free pass of animals
and birds through the canals.
The anti-erosion forest shelter-belts in the project areas are: the riverside vegetation strips be-
tween the dyke and the right bank of the Bulgarian section of the Danube, the forests of Belene
Island, and the 220 meter strip at the high river bank. These areas are intended to contribute to
the stability of the bank strip by means of the protective functions of the forests, also to improve
the landscape around the water current, and hinder erosion, landslide, abrasion, and other de-
structive processes.
The forest shelter belts up to 10 meter wide that are situated on both side of irrigation and other
artificial water currents have a meliorative impact, which results in stabilization of the environ-
ment, improvement of the microclimate, reduction of evaporation from the spaces between the
canals.
In the riverside strips of the Danube growing, renovating, reconstruction and sanitary cutting is
performed. In case of a full cutting of poplar vegetation in the area between the dyke and the riv-
erbank, creation of willow trees shelterbelt is obligatory.
Please check the translation to make sure that willow is willow and poplar is poplar!
Natural water currents have a characteristic cross section that determines how is riverside vegeta-
tion upwards from the aquatic zone of the bank slope to be situated. After the deep fast-running
water section, there is a shallower section of slow waters and various vegetation. Then, above it,
there is a wetland riverside area of the reed belt, alders, willows and poplars, and finally comes
the dry area of the hardwood tree and bush species. Apart from the vegetation, deeper waters and
the shallows are inhabited by various animal species, and thus a finite ecological system is cre-
ated, which is ecologically balanced and almost entirely self-purifying.
Controlled vegetation planting along the water currents provides one of the best ways to stabilize
the soil and prevent bank erosion. A protection layer can be created on the riverside slope with
an appropriate dip by means of turfing, grass and planting of suitable bulrush, reed, and even
softwood bush variety. It is also recommended that there be left an open, unafforested area, at
least 6 m. wide, between the dyke heel and the planted poplar woods.
In the forest shelterbelts along the irrigation canals, maintenance cutting of average intensity is
performed, which ensures the appropriate structure and aerating of the vegetation.
Marshes - The marshes are a variety of the natural water areas - these are basins whose total
area, or most of it, is taken by hydrophilic vegetation. During planning and development of the
areas around the water basins, it is a generally accepted practice for them to be planted with typi-
cal vegetation. The wetland between the water and the dry lands can be planted with special
grass mixtures of wild perennial grass species with a strong surface root system that will
strengthen the soil.
Various foreign and home specialists have concluded that biological conservation and self-
purification of the natural and artificial water basins can be achieved by means of appropriate
vegetation. Water basins and areas protection is ensured by means of several vegetation belts,
which appear as filters where polluted water passes through. In order to protect the water basin it
is necessary to ensure a wide strip of land with loose soil, rich in microorganisms, which, to-
gether with the vegetation growing on it, retains a large quantity of harmful material.

III.9.2.AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE
Areas of good prerequisites for farming and large scale agricultural structure; areas of low pro-
duction potential, which will be changed by merging or termination of their utilization as farm-
ing land.
Areas of high natural value, which will be stabilized and integrated in agriculture on the basis of
expected funding of their landscape development.
The mismatch of interests in agricultural utilization of the land and the stable structure of the
various landscape elements entails inevitable changes. Each landscape, however, can be changed
within certain limits, and then a new type of agricultural landscape appears - a new landscape
structure is forced on the original natural system.
In some agricultural regions restoration of the traditional scenery of the farming landscape is
governed by other principles, different of those of farming (tourism and recreation, ecological
protection, limiting of the urbanization process, etc.)
When a new strategy is developed for the future of the farming lands in the are, a balance must
be achieved between the necessity to preserve and revive natural environment, and the social is-
sue, related to the depopulation of particular regions.
Efforts must be directed towards the realization of some activities like introduction and mainte-
nance of farming activities that meet the requirements of the natural landscape conservation;
buying out of land or waming of proprietors by the state about the performing of environment
protection activities, about wildlife conservation, creation of ecological refuges and corridors,
development of recreation areas, etc.
A current issue for the farming regions is that more and more people are living and working in
the countryside, in the agricultural field; the strife for wildlife protection is gaining strength, also
the efforts to re-establish the old agricultural traditions.
Changes in agricultural landscapes due to the acceleration of the urbanization process are related
to the taking up of agricultural terrain for the developmcnt of urban places and their accompany-
ing functional zones. For example, the transport system is both a source of soil pollution but also
a largely land-consuming system.
Internal factors for changes in the structure, appearance and character of the agricultural land-
scapes are connected to the way the land is cultivated, the application of pesticides, fertilizers,
stimulators, irrigation systems construction, etc.
According to 1991 data, in Bulgaria land is distributed by 0.45 ha per capita, however about 96%
of our farming land is polluted and damaged.
III.9.3.TYPES OF AGRICULTURAL AREAS
Agricultural areas as a whole fall in the category of non-irrigation farming, irrigation farming,
and pastureland.
In natural landscapes there is a constant circulation of substances and energy between the soil
and the vegetation. In agricultural areas, however, this process is one-sided - nutrient substances
are obtained from the soil through the crops, while their natural return from drying up and vege-
tation rotting is missing. The formation of humus substances in the soil is slower and at a smaller
scale. Agricultural land cultivation leads to mineralization of the organic and humus substances,
to dusting and loss of nutrients. What is more, erosion occurs, various weeds start developing,
and yield shrinks. As a result from ploughing up and washing of solid particles, solid composi-
tion inflow to the rivers is increased. Thus river water chemical composition is changed due to

agricultural waste pollution. In closed water basins and smaller rivers with a deferred water cir-
culation phytoplankton increases, which in turn leads to lack of oxygen and the appearance of
the so called "dead water". The eutrification process is very difficulty to be reversed.
Irrigation farming - it is the cause for some of the most serious anthropogeous changes of the
landscape. Agricultural landscape is changed most drastically in the areas of irrigation and drain-
age systems. Changes take the following shape: change in the relief - network configuration of
the landscape structure, changes in the microclimate, disruption of the general water balance;
disruption of natural soil formation; occurrence of irrigation erosion, secondary acid salls forma-
tion in the soil.
Pasture stockbreeding is a separate kind of agricultural utilization of the area. Overuse of grass
landscapes for pasture of a large number of cattle has caused changes - general deterioration, turf
destruction, soil destruction, etc.
Activities for agricultural landscape development - the efforts foe restoration of the eroded agri-
cultural farmland are carried out as a system of landscape development activities - agroengineer-
ing, hydro engineering, and afforestation and melioration activities.
Beside the basic ecological, engineering, and economic problems pertaining to the agricultural
landscape development, there are also some social and aesthetic issues to be resolved. Part of
them have to do with the conservation of the landscape structure containing the basic elements -
crops, vegetation belts, tree plantations, water areas and irrigation channels; the others concern
the establishing of land-utilization culture, and also the agricultural landscape utilization in the
recreation sphere, and development of the so called "rural tourism".
Agricultural landscape protection in Bulgaria is made possible by the some new laws on regional
development, on property and farmland utilization, which regulate the way the land should be
used without damaging the soils, and in compliance to the sanitary and hygiene, fire precaution
and ecological requirements.
It is also essential that landscape development plans be available for the areas studied, which
should include the following:
* determining of the basic damage caused by the development of agriculture -soil and water
pollution, erosion, acid salts concentration, decrease in soil fertility, destroyed habitats,
etc.;
* planning of the routes and the sites of the engineering infrastructure of the agricultural ar-
eas, and special purpose areas, and their shaping with appropriate tree and bush vegeta-
tion so that they fit the scenery better;
* creation of isolation vegetation massifs around the agricultural structures, the cattle
farms, warehouses, etc;
* merging of areas of perennial vegetation into large massifs;
* development of a system of forest shelter-belts;
* choosing of recreation places along the water currents;
* development of a synchronized system of the area by merging of all isolation and protec-
tive forest massifs, perennial agricultural crops, forest shelter-blets, etc. which form the
spatial structure of agricultural landscapes;
* creation of ecological "isles" - sections of natural vegetation, as safe ports for animal and
plant species threatened with extinction.

III.9.4.FOREST LANDSCAPES
Human activity is a basic phytogeographic factor. Our forests fall into two basic groups, accord-
ing to their utilization: economic utilization and special purpose forests. Special purpose forests
are:
Protected natural forest areas:
* natural reserves, protected landscapes;
Other special purpose areas:
* hunting ground;
The age structure of the forests is negative. The greater part is of young trees of age up to 20
years, and those of the III class, of age 40-60 years only comprise 3/4 of the forest areas. Such
type of age structure is unsuitable both for economic maintenance and for recreation activity.
In the Bulgarian forest areas classification system (Robev, Zahariev) the lowland forest land-
scapes comprise of areas of willow and poplar plantations, plain and mixed ones, along the Da-
nube riverside, also those of its tributaries, as well as those of the islands subject to longer peri-
ods of flooding.
There is one peculiar type of forest plantation that very well reflect the forest-anthropogenic ac-
tivity relation, and namely small woods, green isolation and shelter belts, as well as small groups
or single trees on the agricultural landscape. Against this countryside background they are the
sole survivors of the vegetation habitats, which are now hosts of a peculiar wildlife, without
which the ecological equilibrium in nature would be impossible. It is therefore not recommend-
able to use them in a way to compromise their specific character of natural plant communities
and animal habitats.
A certain tendency has been recognized for transforming part of cultivated land into forest plan-
tation areas with the aim of improving the landscape state by creation of new wildlife habitats,
stimulation of the recreation tourism and sports activity utilization of these areas, and thus in-
creasing farmers' income and the ensuring of new employment, plus the new wood production.
However, during the construction process the landscape will be disturbed. Some of the landscape
types, as well as visual appearance and character will inevitably be changed.
111.10. CULTURAL HERITAGE
Close to PS23 of Drainage System Brushlen is found Kaleto - a historical site that is very often
visited by treasure-hunters and sometimes by tourists (D. After a choice of the flooding alterna-
tive, it might have to be surrounded by protective dykes. Is it known at what elevation the site is
located and how feasible it would be for this site to be affected? If yes - please indicate. If not -
please recommend the corresponding assessment.
111.I1. HEALTH RISK
111.11.1.    MOSQUITOES AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES
The mosquitoes from the Ainophleles genus transmit the four types of plasmodia, which are the
causative agents of human malaria. They are Plasm odiumn vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P.
falciparum and cause the tertian, the quartan, the atypical tertian, and the tropical malaria respec-
tively. Prior to 1965, all of them were detected in Bulgaria. Three types of malaria transmitting
mosquitoes were registered in Bulgaria.

Anopheles maculipennis is the most widespread in our country. It is almost ubiquitous but pre-
fers cleaner and overgrown with vegetation water basins that are slightly shaded, shallow, and
sunlit. It is widespread in the Danube River wetlands nowadays.
Aniopheles sacharovii is spread at the seaside and is the second most important causative agent. It
is not met around the Danube River.
Aniopheles superpictus is the third most important plasmodium transmitter, which larvae develop
in slow stony-bottomed streams. It is widespread around the Danube River, particularly during
the late summer months.
The species composition of mosquitoes will not change following wetlands restoration. -Mosqui-
toes, which could be potential transmitters of malaria plasmodia, are encountered within the re-
gion in great numbers even now.
In 1965, Bulgaria was announced a malaria-free country by the World Health Organization. Ac-
cording to the Rousse Sanitary Inspectorate, no endemic malaria cases were registered in any of
the Danube River settlements. In Bulgaria, only single malaria cases imported by Bulgarian or
foreign citizens from endemic malaria regions are known. The disease may reappear in the fol-
lowing ways:
By means of infected people - if a large number (>10) of people infected with malaria are lo-
cated simultaneously in any malaria plasmodium endemic regions (none in Bulgaria) and they
are exposed to the bite by the mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus for a sufficient period of time.
Could you indicate what period of time would be sufficient?
Through infected mosquitoes - with the import of Aniopheles genuis mosquitoes into the region,
infected with malaria plasmodium. Such an import could happen through migration of mosqui-
toes from endemic foci in neighboring regions. However, we should take into consideration that
mosquitoes do not migrate more than 10 km. The closest endemic malaria foci are the Asian part
of Turkey and the south parts of Greece (700 -800 km), i.e. the transmission of plasmodia is
not possible in practice.
Neither of the situations aforesaid does depend on the surface area of the recovered marshlands,
nor will be facilitated by the activities related to the restoration of the wetlands. The recovery of
the wetlands will not increase the risk of malaria under any circumstances. Please make this
statement stand out and include it in the conclusion of the report.
The mosquito number depends mainly on the presence of shallow waters or floods, which are not
linked to the main water basin, and where the temperature is rather high for any fish or amphibia,
which feed on larvae, to be present. Therefore, the mosquito number is greater during the driest
periods and years no matter how paradoxically it sounds, when the water basins break down into
separate puddles and the appropriate habitats are abundant. The restoration of the wetlands,
which presupposes a comparatively constant high level, would limit to a great extent these habi-
tats.
The greater part of the people living around the project areas that were born in the 40's or before
(and they are the predominant portion) suffered malaria or their relatives suffered or died from
this disease. These people associate the disease disappearance only to the drainage of the marsh-
lands, in which they also took part. It should be made clear to them that malaria cannot arise
suddenly by itself; it should be transmitted from somewhere. The great mosquito number is
not a reason for malaria appearance.
Malaria plasmodium carries out a part of its cycle -the sporogonium -in the mosquito body,
which terminates with the appearance of sporozoites in the mosquito salivary glands. The dura-
tion of sporogony depends on the temperature of the environment, where the mosquito is located

and on the type of plasmodium. If temperature is low, the mosquito development stops and con-
tinues with its rise. It means that the gonotrophic cycle is shorter than the sporogony duration.
The female undergoes 3-4 cycles, although only one sporogonium is carried out. It was shown
that a certain amount of summated heat is necessary for the realization of sporogony, the lower
threshold being 16C; in such case the sporogony duration is increased for the development to
take place. This is the reason the foothills in Bulgaria to be free of malaria.
We recommend that an approved methodology for mosquito control be used. Such methodology
is described in the report of the team working on the ToR for the Management Plan.
111.11.2.    FACTORS, WHICH INFLUENCE MALARIA INFECTION
* Degree of susceptibility to the infection with the human plasmodium.
* Duration of sporozoa preservation in the salivary glands: e.g. in Anl. superpictus they de-
generate more rapidly than in An. maculipenniiisi.
* Mosquito count -the transmission probability is proportional to the mosquito number.
* Mechanism of host seeking and finding.
* Seasonal course in mosquito counts, individual life duration.
* Number of gonotrophic cycles and number of females reaching maturity.
* Endophility (in or outdoors mosquitoes).
* Mosquito hibernation (as a larve or an imago).
Four types from the Plasmodium genus parasitize in man, which cause 4 malaria diversities.
Plasmodiunm vivax causes the Tertian malaria, P. falciparum -the Tropical malaria, P. malarie
- the Quartan malaria, and P. ovale -a tertian malaria with a weaker manifestation.
The bloodsucking mosquitoes as plasmodia transmitters
In the past the malaria transmitters in our country were the mosquitoes An. maculipennis and An.
superpictus. In 1965 The World Ilealth Organization officially declared Bulgaria for a malaria-
free country. Since then up to nowadays only cases of imported malaria were registered in our or
foreign citizens coming from endemic malaria regions. However, on a world scale even nowa-
days malaria remains the most widespread protozoic disease on the planet, from which still suf-
fer over 200 million of people annually and over I million die, mostly children. The local
(autochthonous) malaria in Europe is to a great extent eradicated -there are still cases of that
disease in Turkey, as well as single cases were registered in Greece and in the Soviet Union.
Now, the major problem in Europe is the malaria imported from other continents.
111.11.3.    TAENIAE
Only one type of the taenia Metagonimus vokogawai (Fam. Heterophyidae) with host the fresh-
water cephalus Leuciscus cephalus was described in 1978 in the Lom's and Svishtov's regions
from the parasites with a fish host, which could be dangerous to human health. As far as it is a
typical river (reophilic) species and its entry into the recovered wetlands would be occasional
and only in single numbers, the risk of that parasite is practically zero. This taenia has not been
observed in humans so far. How do the highlighted parts make sense together? Has it not been
found in man in Bulgaria or ever? An infection could occur only through consumption of un-
cooked fish that was not freed from its viscera.

111.11.4.    HEALTH RISK FOR THE LIVESTOCK
The only livestock disease of significance directly related to wetlands is the parasitic distoma. It
is caused by the trematode Fasciola hepatica. Its final hosts are almost all domestic animals and
many wild animals. The intermediary host of the disease, Galba truncatula, establishes the link to
the wetlands. Usually, the most widespread contagion occurs during the autumn. The parasite es-
tablishes itself in the liver and in the gall-bladder ducts. Typically, a large number of the animals
in the herd/flock fall ill at the same time with various, non-specific symptoms. The acute phase is
followed by a chronic sequence, almost without any symptoms.
According to the Mekom slaughterhouse in the town of Silistra, which collects animals from the
entire northeastern part of Bulgaria, the sheep and cattle in the area are 75% infested with this
parasite. The restoration of the wetlands cannot increase this percentage of incidence, which has
reached its saturation maximum.
The same is assumed to be the case in the Belene Island of which no data are available. Trema-
tode is a widespread disease at present, more like indisposition among the diseased animals,
whose only economic impacts is slight reduction of meat and milk yields. The risk of serious re-
generation of trematode and possible serious agricultural damage is unfounded.
The remaining transmittable diseases such as leptospirosis and the parasitic diseases such as pa-
ramphystomytosis, echinostomatosis, drepanidoteniosis and spirouratoses in birds are related to
water to certain extent but are unrelated to the restoration of the wetlands.
111.11.5.    RISK FACTORS DURING THE BUILDING PROCESS
Risk for the health of people working without abiding the requirements of the Healthy and Safe
Working Conditions Law (Governmental Journal, Vol. 124, 1997) and its substatutory acts.
During the realization of the building projects:
* Atmospheric air and working environmental pollution with increased concentrations, dust
and other building materials with a marked effect upon the upper respiratory system, the
eyes, and the skin;
* Exhaust-pipe gases and end-products from the destruction of motor lubricating oils of the
building machines;
* Additional noise loading;
* Risk of accidents and damages;
* Inappropriate stocking of building materials.
It is necessary to abide to the instructions for safety of work and to keep strictly the technological
and labor discipline in order to avoid the risk for human health.
The resources spent in agriculture and in forestry enterprise, as well as the resources for preven-
tion from mosquitoes, should be coordinated with the Ministry of Health authorities.

IV. ANALYSIS OF THE ALTERNATIVES WITH REGARD TO THEIR EFFECT ON
THE ENVIRONMENT, ANALYSIS OF THE "NO PROJECT" ALTERNATIVE
INCLUDED.
IV.1. ZERO ALTERNATIVE
The zero alternative (no project) will cause complete degradation of wetlands and, even, disap-
pearance in the near future of some marshes (such as on Belene island) in the two project areas.
This would have a negative effect from environmental and conservation viewpoints. It should
not be forgotten that in the past these had been among the most important floodplains for fish
spawning and for breeding of certain rare bird species along the Bulgarian banks of the Danube
with enormous significance for fishing, sustainable natural maintenance of the fish resources and
preservation of the populations of endangered species of birds, and of the biodiversity in general.
In reality, the environmental situation in the project areas would be favorable for the more and
more massive spreading of mosquitoes in the region. The situation is such that there are shallow
drying water bodies with standing water, many puddles, marshes and wet meadows, all com-
bined with insufficient natural predators feeding on the larvae of mosquitoes (such as certain fish
species and aquatic invertebrates).
There is no serious potential for the economic use of these lands. The wetlands cannot be used
for sustainable agricultural practices due to the negative impact of ground water, due to risk of
soil salination. Only limited grazing is possible (extensive livestock breeding) and extraction of
reed and wood, which would not have a significant socio-economic effect for the local popula-
tion.
There is international pressure for the implementation of ratified conventions and international
documents directly or indirectly related to the issue of wetland restoration under which Bulgaria
has undertaken international commitments, such as the Co'vention on wetlands of international
importanice especially as waterfowl habitat (the Ramsar Convenitioni), 1971; the Convention on
co-operation for the protection and suistainable use of the Daniube river, 1994; the Convention
on the protection anid utse of transboundary watercourses and internlationlal lakes (Helsinki,
1992); the Convention betweeni the Government of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Government
ofRomlantia on environlmental co-operation, 1992; the 1992 Conventioni on biological diversity;
Convenition on the conservationi of Europeani wildlife anid natural habitats (the Bern Conven-
tion); the Conventioni on the conservationi of migratory species of wild animals (the Boinn Coni-
ventioni), 1979 (amtiended 1985,1988); the Convenition concerningfishinig in the Danube water,
etc.
In conclusion, the zero alternative would cause restriction of any large investment in the area de-
fined as a pilot area for restoration of the large wetlands along the lower stretch of the Danube.
Such restoration project would lead to rejuvenation of the area, creation of new jobs, supporting
of and initialization of sustainable economic practices as well as a number of other indirect ac-
tivities in support of the local population which lives in deep poverty at present.
IV.2. ALTERNATIVES FOR THE RESTORATION OF BELENE ISLAND
In general, we support regulation of the proposed flood level in this project area up to 20 m
above sea level as is provided for in 4 of the proposed technical flooding alternatives. Although a
slightly higher flooding level would ensure a much larger flooded area (2,400 ha, as compared to
only 1,562 ha), the high levels of the water of the Danube are rather short at present and would
not last for more than a few days (following the construction of the Iron Gate facility). I'umping
of water would be required to maintain such high levels for longer periods, which is extremely
expensive and virtually impossible owing to the high permeability of soil. We believe that the
Environmental Assessment                                                       61
Wetlands Restoration and Pollution Reduction Project



Analwtical Creative Group LTD
proposed flooding level of 20 m will ensure flooding duration of 50-60 days, which is sufficient
from an environmental point of view.
Two of the alternatives propose entry of the water from the southern part of the Belene island
which is undesirable because of the possible thermal impact in the future by the nuclear power
plant whose construction has been stopped, and because of the very high cost of the construction
and maintenance of the canals. We would prefer the other two alternatives offering entry of wa-
ter from the northern side of the island. According to the technical team, one weakness of the
northern flooding option is the "complex water regime around the two inflow points caused by
the unstable bank strip". However, it should be kept in mind that this had been the main and
natural flooding in the past. We put the stress upon the northern option with additional internal
dykes, which protect agricultural land to the west of the wetlands. However, this should be sup-
ported with a much more detailed technical design in order to evaluate the risk of bogging and
salination of agricultural lands, estimate the functioning of the draining system in the western
part of the island used for agricultural produce and assess the risk to the existing infrastructure
and buildings.
IV.3. ALTERNATIVES FOR THE RESTORATION OF KALIMOK-BRUSHLEN
Similar argumentation regarding the flooding level (see above) relate to Kalimok-Brushlen as
well and it should be accepted that following the construction of the Iron Gate facility, the origi-
nal flooding regime will never be restored. Therefore, we support the proposed flooding level of
14 m above sea level. The technical information (according to the report of HPC-Bulgaria Ltd
and Aquatest a.d.-Prague) showed that direct flooding of flood plains is possible for around 60
days and the wetlands will have no connection to the Danube for the remaining 300 days. This is
natural of the type of ecosystem and the natural maintenance of the water level in the marshes by
means of pumping (as proposed for both project areas) would not be a sustainable economic
practice owing to the large financial cost for construction and maintenance to be borne in such
serious economic crisis. We believe that the drying of these habitats is a unique phenomenon and
should not be regarded as a negative aspect, and constant year-round flooding should be sought
after by all means.
The issue of preserving absolutely all dykes should be clarified and that the flooding regime will
depend on the inflowing and outgoing of water through sluices and through soil infiltration. The
sluices should be designed to comply with the possibilities for migration of the fish species in the
lower stretch of the Danube, i.e. they should be equipped with adequate fish ladders.
At this stage we cannot render definite support for any of the alternative ideas for the flooding of
the Kalimok-Brushlen marshes for the following reasons: (i) No technical solution of the prob-
lem of irrigation of large agricultural land prior to the wetlands has been proposed, since the cur-
rent drainage will be stopped by the restored marshes and would lead to flooding of agricultural
land and infrastructure; (ii) All possible efforts should be made to restore the Brushlen marsh and
the wetlands along the Tarchil river. These wetlands are of different types and would provide for
multiple increasing of the conservation significance and sustainable drainage of the Tutrakan
marsh pan-valley. At present these are severely degraded, poor in biodiversity and with deterio-
rated ecological conditions; (iii) The technical aspects of flooding of the eastern zone ol the for-
mer fish farm are not provided for in any of the altematives. There is an enormous number of
dykes in these fish farms, formerly Bulgaria's largest, that would not be flooded at levels of 14
m, i.e. much of the project area would remain unflooded. The opening of the fish farm and the
provision of open connection between the pools should be a primary objective of the project in
order to stop the rapid degradation of the empty or half-empty old pools. The remaining struc-
tures in the Eastern zone of the fish farm are a serious technical problem regarding the flooding
of the Kalimok marsh; (iv) We do not accept one of the alternatives for construction of deeper
fish pools (for intensive fish farming) at a depth of 2-2.5 m and their connection via meandering

canals, since this negates the project objectives and the cost would be enonnous. Also, the natu-
ralness of these wetlands would be largely lost and these artificial structures would be useless in
trapping nitrogen and phosphorous from the Danube.
We would prefer the first proposed alternative for maximum restoration of the project area, but
with the construction of many additional protective internal dykes and other protective struc-
tures.
IV.4. USAGE OF THE PRODUCTION FROM THE FLOODED FORESTS, REED, AND
THE FLOODED MEADOWS
IV.4.1. FLOODED FORESTS
In order to foster nutrient reduction, the accumulated biomass should be regularly removed and
utilized by the local population in an appropriate way. The utilization of the biomass may be car-
ried out as a fuel (with or without an additional transformation into brickets of patent fuel), as a
raw material in the paper industry or as a building material. When necessary, the areas of the
flooded forests could be increased artificially and regulated.
IV.4.2. FLOODED MEADOWS
The flooded meadows may be utilized for non-increase/reduction of the nutrient sources in the
same way like in the flooded forests. Following the falling of the water level, the meadow pro-
duction may be utilized as hay or pastures. The production in the flooded meadows is up to 1 kg
dry weight/m2/per year.
IV.4.3. REED AREAS
The reed area production may be utilized as a fuel or as a raw material for the paper industry.
According to the measurements in 'Sreburna' reserve (near Kalimok), the production by this
community is 1.926 kg neat dry weight/m2/per year.
The utilization of all type of resources should be strictly regulated and limited. The utilization of
the game resources should be subjected to a strict control as well. The number of some animal
species should be limited (Belene Island) such as jackals, boars, rooks, which are a great many of
for the time being and menace the populations of rare and threatened species. The legal regula-
tions for utilization of the protected territories should be abided to.
The stage of recovery of the affected components of nature will be longer, and yet their nature
conservation value will increase.
IV.5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF FISHERY
IN THE PROJECT AREAS
IV.5.1. LEGAL REGULATION OF FISHERY IN THE REGION
Under the new law for fishery and aquacultures the Danubian wetlands are considered foresight-
edly as areas where fishing and fishery may be carried out (although at the time being such wet-
lands practically do not exist). The licenses that are issued nowadays are valid only for the Da-
nube River. With a lack of a forbidding regimen mentioned in the ordinances about the protected
areas, separate licenses will be issued for the Danubian wetlands Fishing could be carried out by
everybody who possesses a certified fishing license issued by the Regional Forest Authorities
(RFA).

AnalYtical Creative Group LTD
IV.5.2. PROPOSED VARIANTS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A FISHING MANAGEMENT REGIME IN
THE PROJECT TERRITORIES
IV.5.2.1. Kalimok-Brushlen
Variant #1
Complete ban on fishing. This is the best solution for the ichthyofauna preservation provided the
other conditions are ideal. Unfortunately, the control will be rather difficult in practice due to the
vastness and difficult accessibility of the territory. The security efficiency will be very low,
while the poacher methods seriously damage the ichthyofauna. The reserve Srebuma may be
given as an example, where the poacher fishing is a severe threat and its prevention requires a lot
of finances. It is not recommended.
Variant #2
Authorization of fishing (by annual licenses according to the new law) within a specified period,
as well ban on the catching of certain species and fish catch quotas. As a result of the supposed
large number of fishermen, control on fishing and catches will be very difficult. An actual risk
exists for overfishing or fishing in the prohibited periods and territories. As a result of the short-
term duration of the licenses the fishermen are not interested in sustainable fishing. It is not rec-
ommended.
Variant #3
Creation of a fishing cooperation, which should manage the fish wealth of the recovered wetland
- it is the best variant in practice as the fishermen from the cooperation are interested in sus-
tainable fishing due to the supposed long-term functioning of the cooperation, the control is
much easier as only one unit is regulated. There exist conditions for intrinsic control. The fish-
ermen in the cooperation will not allow poaching themselves. Working places will be opened for
non-fishermen.
An example with the 'Danube' Cooperative
The 'Danube' Cooperative was founded after 1921 in the Brushlen village with the appearance
of 'Law for Fishing' and with a fishing region the Brushlen marshy lowland. Toward 1938 it
comprised 28 persons and eleven boats, The Law for Fishing had provided funding of fishing co-
operation. Part of their profit (10%) was deduced according the law for the maintenance of the
marshland - guards, canal. It probably lasted till the draining of the lake. Unfortunately, because
of the short time and the difficult access to the archives, we cannot specify the quantity and the
species composition of the fish caught by the cooperation. The cooperation chart is to be written
by a team of specialists - ichthyologists and IARA experts. As basic limitations there will be -
prohibition on introduction of non-native species, prohibition on fishing during the reproduction
period, a catch quota can also be introduced, along with other similar measures. Marshland fish-
ing has to be stimulated by means of comparatively inefficient but highly spectacular fishing
methods such as "on guard". Together with the Danubian Fishing Museum in Tutrakan, tradi-
tional fishing can be transformed into an ecotourism opportunity. A fish market can be founded
in Tutrakan where everyone will abide to clear rights and obligations, the whole establishment
being under IARA control It is also necessary that regulatory framework, and fishermen's atti-
tude towards membership in such a cooperation be studied, but this will happen over time.
IV.5.2.2. Belene
There are no problems on the island in connection with poaching control, therefore it does not
exist a real poacher danger. Nonetheless, it is important that fishing management is coordinated
with the prison management, whose members are very unlikely to agree to prohibition on fishing
Environmental Assessment                                                     64

Analytical Creative Group LTD
in the wetlands that have previously been used as fisheries as part of the prison facility. In the
event of lack of such consent, fishing prohibition automatically becomes meaningless as far as
control is concerned. The best alternative would be for the wetlands to be maintained by the
prison itself; this combined with certain rules to be complied with, similar to those of the pro-
posed Brushlen cooperative.
Table 24 shows the fish catches from the Svishtov-Silistra section with the sole purpose of giv-
ing an idea of the significance of fishing in the Danube as a mainstay for local people. These lists
also clarify the current situation of the ichthyofauna there. Numerity distribution is the follow-
ing: 1. Various; 2 Barbel; 3. Wells; 4. Tolstolob; 5. Carp; 6. Common beams; 7. Sturgeon.
This statistic clearly points the domination of the rheophillic species - a tendency that has ex-
isted since the 70s. The cause for it was established long ago (Marinov, 1978) - draining of our
Danubian riverside marshlands. This catch of 144 tons of fish per year is done by a total of 240
fishermen, that is 600 kg per professional fisherman. The average price per kg being BGL 2.50 it
can easily be calculated that a fisherman gets around BGL 1,500 per year, or BGL 125 per
month. Of course, here we do not include fuel expense for motor boats in the estimates, which
could, on the other hand, reach up to 70% of the value of the fish caught. To put it simply, this
means that profit amounts to BGL 450 per year. We believe the numbers we get from the fish-
ermen themselves do not correspond to the actual figure, but are twice as high. It appears that at
present fishing is not the main activity to support a family. Fishing is one of the traditional occu-
pations, which are however, becoming less and less popular among the young generation. For
example, there are about 45 licensed fisherman in the town of Belene, of whom the greater part
have some other job or are now retired. They believe that fishing alone cannot support their
families, all of them practicing fishing from the Danube solely.
IV.5.3. FISH FARMING
One basic recommendation for both of the areas under consideration is that they should not be
transformed for industrial fish production. It is by no means acceptable to have non-native spe-
cies - even as a measure against the mosquitoes (see below). The only exceptions present the
worldwide-endangered status species, which supposedly inhabited the Danubian wetlands before
their drainage (Umbra krameri). In a situation (scenario) where the natural re-introduction from
the Danube would prove difficult or impossible, semi-artificial stocking can be allowed with
wetlands species such as the Carp, Prussian Carp, Wells, Ide, etc., and this only provided that the
breeding stock was taken from the Danube itself. It is here recommended the implementation of
such a regime or scenario that would not hinder natural fish reproduction. Should this be the
case, artificial stockbreeding would be much less efficient and at the same time more expensive
than the natural process. From an economic point of view, in the long termn artificial breeding
will prove much less profitable than the execution of an appropriate scenario, and the mainte-
nance of an optimal hydrological regime favoring natural reproduction.
IV.5.3.1. Comment on some of the most often discussed artificial breeding and introduc-
tion variants
In earlier studies, an assessment was made of the breeding of Gambusia for biological control of
the mosquito larvae, as well as to determine why Gambusia was not bred prior to 1921. The as-
sessment found quite a large number of new species in the Bulgarian Danube sector, such as the
sunbleak note that the same species has been named Belica, Owsyanka or Sunbleak in various
places throughout this document. Please decide on the correct English name of the species and
use only one (Leuicaspius delineatus), enlisted in Bulgaria's Red Data Book. The Sunbleak is not
a new inhabitant but has rather been left unstudied and undetermined because of its closeness to
the juvenile specimens of other Carp species. The Sunbleak is the local equivalent of the North
American Gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki) used for the biological control of the mosquitoes. Its

existence enforces a total ban on non-local species breeding, and especially with Gambusia, al-
though the Sunbleak would probably dominate in a competing habitat, which is what happened
after the first artificial breeding in 1921.
Other species include the so-called "far-east complex" (Ctenlopharingodonl idella, Hypoph thal-
nmichthys molitrix, and Aristichthvs nobilis). These species are not representatives of the local
ichthyofauna, and to a certain extent are in the role of rivals of some of the local species. They
do not reproduce in the area, which is not their natural environment (some data have been col-
lected for particular specimens' reproduction within the Danube river, but there is no evidence to
such a process within the Bulgarian section.) Artificial stocking with them could only be justified
if the restored/revived areas are used as fisheries for industrial fish growing. These species' func-
tion would be to assimilate such resources in an ecosystem that are not, under normal circum-
stances, utilized by other fishes, but by other organisms (birds, invertebrate) for the purpose of
obtaining as higher quantity of fish biological mass from a decar as possible. Moreover, because
of what was just pointed, and namely that these species do not reproduce in Bulgaria's natural
environment, small fish stocking would be necessary each year, which in part, provided there is a
connection with the Danube, will shortly afterwards migrate to the river (Romanian Danube
fisheries are quite experienced in this fact from the biology of the far-east complex representa-
tives). This fact makes artificial stocking less profitable from economic point of view. Apart
from all this, they need to be caught at the end of autumn, and provided opportunity to enter the
Danube rivers (thus being highly unlikely to return in spring), since they are heat-loving species
and cannot survive the low winter temperatures in the vicinity of the shallow marshlands.
Artificial introduction of the Mud Minnow (Umbra krameri) - a species not proven for Bulgaria
- in case an international action plan for the species is undertaken, there should be a way for its
artificial introduction within the country. It is possible that the species used to be encountered in
Bulgaria but it has disappeared after the draining of the marshes - investigations of the marshes
did not use to be the practice - this is also supported by the fact that the Sunbleak was only dis-
covered for the Danube fauna during our expedition, and this in numbers that put it on one of the
first places along with the Roach.
IV.5.4. FISHERIES
This is a comment on the suitability of the Riahovo fish ponds for the growing of Sturgeon, and
it does not have as its aim the presentation and preparation of specialized investigation for a pro-
ject organization or promotion. It could, however, lay the foundation for the future teams per-
forming necessary activities connected with the restoration of the marshlands.
The Riahovo fishponds are located close to the ricer but are at present dry, and even used for
farming purposes. In this kind of fishponds (ground - piling type) Sturgeon growing is very diffi-
cult and unprofitable. It needs investment of considerable funds for the construction of concrete
reservoirs. Also, it will need a permanent water flow of at least 20-50 I/sec/dca, and this water
could be from the Danube (the conducted chemical analysis showed that the water has good in-
dices, and only during high-temperature periods it will be necessary to improve basin flow rate
so that oxygen deficit can be compensated, and also to avoid water overheating). One other pos-
sible way, which is much preferable, is the use of drill water but considering the fisheries' prox-
imity to the guarded water supply area, procuring a permission for drilling would hardly be pos-
sible.
Further down, we provide the basic information of the most flexible of the Danube Sturgeon -
the Sterlet Sturgeon, to give a more clear idea of the conditions that would have to be established
in the fisheries:

Sterlet Sturgeon (Acipenser rhutenus)
For this purpose large basins would be needed, and such of higher flow rate (20 I/sec/decar) of
the water, and goof oxygen circulation. It cannot inhabit basins overgrown with higher water
vegetation, and is therefore often grown in mixed crops with the Ctenopharinigodon idella. There
is also one method of concrete basin growing (ex-salmon farms). It eats benthos, and it also as-
similates limited quantity of artificial food. Reproduction is only artificial in case of hypophysis.
Spawn incubation period is between 100 and 120 hours. It grows slowly and reaches 200-250g
for two vegetation periods (two summers and one winter).
The construction of Sturgeon fisheries requires a large initial investment for the building of in-
frastructure, which repays slowly. Moreover, Sturgeon market is strongly limited and depends on
the export quota, assigned to Bulgaria, and thence to the companies trading with caviar. If the
quota is low (as it is now 20% of the requested), then respectively the breeding material quantity
that the company can breed into the Danube is small. This quantity can often drop below the
profit margin (if there is a rival company developed on the market). Construction of such fisher-
ies requires serious preliminary analysis, and a very reliable and good future management.
The growing of Sturgeon fishes to trade size (or maturity) does not prove profitable.
It is therefore necessary to decide on what species of Sturgeon will be grown and to what pur-
pose.
Construction will need funding, which can be granted by the NDEF or some of the nature protec-
tion foundations.
IV.5.5. ASSESSMENT OF OTHER WATER BIORESOURCES (CRAYFISH, FROGS, ETC.) AND THEIR
UTILIZATION POTENTIAL
There is no tradition of professional crab and frog catching within the project areas. Crabs are
caught solely in the bank cavities of the Danube riverside. We dispose of no information on the
resource quality in the Danube riverside marshland, even in the Srebuma Reserve. It calnot be
assessed whether they would be of any economic importance without the artificial breeding pre-
ceding restoration of the wetlands. Fishermen consider crab catching a funny activity, and would
prevailingly not take it up.
The big water frog is the subject of even amateur hunting. It does not inhabit the project areas in
large' numbers because of the large flood areas. Its future significance has not yet been assessed
because of the lack of information of previous population state.
Probably, if there happen to be established markets for these species, new interest will arise. The
basic question is whether such a practice should be introduced in the area, which is a potential
threat of destruction of the populations of before mentioned species. It is, therefore, suggested
that an assessment should be made after the restoration of the area of whether the recovering
wetland resources could sustain such damages.
IV.6. MEASURES FOR WETLAND RESTORATION
For the wetlands to be able to perform their nature conservation functions, measures should be
taken for the restoration of their normal water regime. Restoration of the wetlands is to a large
extent dependent on the engineering decisions of the project - the essence of the construction the
purposes it fulfills, choosing of a variant alternative, financial means available, social responsi-
bility and citizen benefit, also the execution, and of course, last but not least, the maintenance of
the achieved.

Revival of the biological diversity is a slow and continuous process requiring consistent mainte-
nance of structures already built. The engineering project and the execution of the different con-
struction works must be well considered in relation to the already existing engineering infrastruc-
ture - canals, dykes, pumping stations, roads, existing buildings, drained areas and their farming,
as well as the interests of the local population and different organizations.
IV.6.1. THE "FLOODING" OPTION
As a whole, both wetland areas considered can be flooded in a natural way by use of the canals
and the dyke sluices. Additional water volume can be fed by pumping, if this is needed.
When pumping water feeding is used, flooding will be supervised and it will not be dependent on
the level of the Danube. Incoming flow will be possible even at low river level so that nutrient
substance can be retained.
Negative aspects: Direct connection to the Danube would be cut, and the marshland ecosystems
will be virtually isolated. A danger exists from the storing of nutrient substance, while pump op-
eration and other artificial measures taken for the maintenance of the closed ecosystem make this
approach quite expensive.
Areas allotted for the construction and restoration of the marshlands and fisheries need to be
cleaned and purified from household and construction waste - sections polluted with pesticides,
fertilizers, petroleum products, vegetation material, etc.
Cleaning of the canals remaining in operation during the new developments from precipitation
and dead organic material.
It is also necessary that before launching of construction works and flooding, the humus layer of
the vegetation areas be removed, and preserved for later farming needs.

V. MONITORING PROPOSAL
The Ministry of Environment and Water is a competent authority in the management and moni-
toring of the actions aimed at environment protection - legislation, strategies, policy, interna-
tional projects and programs, monitoring and supervision, regulation of the activity in the private
and state sector. Part of these activities the Ministry carries out through the Environment Execu-
tive Agency and its network of 15 Regional Inspections of Environment and Water.
Regional Inspections of Environment and Water gather information and perform supervisory
functions in relation to the requirements of ecological legislation/laws for the different environ-
ment components.
The Environment Executive Agency creates and supports a National Automatic System of Eco-
logical Monitoring, also provides information for the functions of the Ministry of Environment
and Water by means of data and analyses, and performs the ecological monitoring for the various
environment components.
V.1. AIR
Harmful emissions over the emission limit values are not expected for said area. It is important
that after realization of the sites the possibility for monitoring concerning the air component be
considered more precisely and profoundly, although no negative impact of the sites on this com-
ponent is expected. It our opinion that for this purpose the data from the national Danube bank
monitoring can be utilized.
V.2. WATER
The wetlands will be flooded to a certain quota. This entails measuring and supervision of:
* quotas of the water level at certain locations within the wetlands;
* quantity of water fed to the wetlands;
* drainage from the wetlands of the Danube.
Measurement locations will be determined according to the alternative chosen.
Introduction of auto-monitoring in relation to the quality of the waters when entering and exiting
the wetlands. A water analysis program connected to the biogenetic elements, and registering of
the degree of reduction and catchment in the wetlands.
At a permanent inflow of Danube water, a short-tern monitoring should be performed of the in-
dices: water quantity, temperature, electric conductivity, pH, BPK5, HPK, HB, total nitrogen, in-
cluding ammonium, nitrate, and organic; total phosphorus, including soluble phosphates.
In rare case of pollution signals monitoring of the specific indices: metal ions, petroleum prod-
ucts, etc.
In case of still water, a monthly registering of the indices for organic pollution and biogenic ele-
ments and sulfides content (hydrogen sulfide).
Annual examination of the river bed alluvia/mantles.
Introduction of a hydrobiological monitoring.
Once per season - complex investigation of the Danube waters within the range of the sites.
Use of the data from the national monitoring stations.

V.3. FLORA AND FAUNA
There is an ecological bird-monitoring center of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
It is important to choose such species whose population status has been followed for the last 10-
15 years at the least. Such species are:
* birds - Chlidonias hybridus and Aythya nyroca
* mammals - Lutra (Lutra lutra), and Vormela pergusnal,
* amphibian - Southern Nine-spined Stickleback (Pungitius platygaster), and Pelebates sy-
riacus balcanicus,
* medical leech, some species dragonfly, zooplankton;
* plants - white water lily (Nymphaea alba), and Trapa natan).
The species are selected in such a way as to cover the largest possible number of biotopes in the
wetlands.
V.4. ICHTHYOFAUNA AND THE ECOSYSTEM
So far it has not been established that biogene concentration (within the range of variation of an
ecosystem as the Danube) in the water influences in any way the physiological status of any spe-
cies of fish, therefore fish populations (and their functions as density, species variety, frequency,
etc.) cannot be used as the direct indicator of biogene concentration and content of their habitat.
Fish, however, can be a very good indicator of the overall ecosystem development, since they
live on different trophic levels and ecological niches, so the presence of some species, and its
number appear a good indicator of the direction the reservoir is developing in. In winter, which
is a non-active state period for most of the species, fish monitoring is also harder, but it can be
carried out by means of other criteria such as winter mortality-rate. This fact is seen as an inevi-
table, and it will undoubtedly damage fish population if carried out in winder when fish is in a
non-active state - December through February.
We suggest that monitoring should comprise of two phases:
Phase I - determining of initial state, before beginning of activity for restoration and monitoring
of changes in the ichthyofauna state during activity performance.
Here monitoring is flexible and performed within short terms, and is closely connected with the
activities carried out. In case of activity, which could cause fast changes in the environment, the
impact of which is unknown, monitoring is carried out parallel to them, and the moment any
negative impact is registered, they are terminated, and new alternatives must be looked for. In
case of activity with negligible impact, monitoring is performed three times a month during the
active season and once a month during winter. Description of fish species offered as bio-
indicators in level III (of monitoring.
Bitterling (Rhodeus amarus)
Brief description : inhabits calm or slow water. The Reproduction process is determined by the
presence of frcshwater mussels of the Unio genus, in whose gill cavity the roe is spawned. Its
development outside the mussel is impossible. Bitterlings do not inhabit places where the mussel
is not present. Mussels, on the other hand, do not develop in drying pools or pools with poor gas-
circulation at the bottom layers. Here the basic indicator for the basin status is the mussel, but
while its monitoring is difficult, bitterling would be the better option especially since it combines
two indicators.
Indicator of clean water, good gas circulation of the bottom for years on end

Carp (Cyprinus carpio)
Brief description. inhabits slow and calm water. For reproduction period goes to temporary
floods and marshes. It spawns its roe on terrestrial flooded vegetation. It can inhabit such areas
permanently but in such cases it barely manages the competition of the other species, especially
the gold fish. It has no preferences to the oxygen content and the quality of the water.
Indicator of good connection between the main basin and the wetland if there is a good number
population of normal age structure.
Weatherfish (Missgurnusfossilis)
Brief description.: inhabits slow and calm water. For reproduction goes to temporary floods or
marshes. No preferences as to oxygen content of the water.
Inidicator of. long-tern good state of the basin, lack of hydrogen sulfide at the bottom layer, and
of the presence of high water vegetation.
Sunbleak (Leucaspius delineatus)
Brief description: Inhabits stagnant water, old river beds, one of the most sensitive species in re-
lation to oxygen content of the water, however, due to the fact that it inhabits the upper water
layer it can be found in basins where other, more sensitive species are not present.
Indicator of:
* as part of the rich ichthyofauna, it is indicator of a good ecological equilibrium
* as a mass sole inhabitant (or together with the Prussian Carp) it is an indicator of past or
present hydrogen sulfide content or for improper oxygen circulation in the bottom layers,
and lack of connection to other basins.

V.5. NEGATIVE ECOLOGICAL SITUATION INDICATORS
Prussian Carp (Carassius gibelio)
Brief descriptioni: ecologically flexible invasive species. Has no preferences as to the habitat
conditions. Seriously endangers its kin species - the Crucian Carp.
Indicator of. when it is the dominating species, it indicates seriously deteriorating reproduction
conditions and bad gas circulation.
Stone morocco (Pseudorasbora parva)
Unevaluated species with potential significance as an indicator of a negative ecological situation
in the restored basins.
Brief description: ecologically flexible invasive species. It is not an original representative of the
local fauna being artificially imported during the 70s. Seriously endangers local species. So far
only separate representatives have been registered.
Each of monitoring levels is independent enough to be used depending on the purposes set. It is
recommended that all three levels of the monitoring be performed since indicators of all three
can be monitored simultaneously, some species overlap or share other characteristics. At full
monitoring the information gathered from each level is much more exhaustive and reliable than
of each level was conducted independently.
V.6. COMMENT ON THE BIO-INDICATOR FISHES SUGGESTED ON THE 1999
DANUBE POLLUTION REDUCTION PROGRAM
State of said species population in the Bulgarian sectors.
* Blue Bream (Abramis ballerus)
* Streber (Zingel streber)
* Crucian Carp (Carassius carassius)
* Weatherfish (Misgumus fossilis)
* Mud Minnow (Umbra krameri)
The two species - Blue Beam and Streber - cannot be used for marshland monitoring since they
are strictly reofill species and do not inhabit still water. The Mud Minnoe is a very good indica-
tor but it, too, cannot be used as such, since today it does not inhabit the lakes, though it probably
did inhabit the clean still waters overgrown with vegetation before marshes were drained. Its
species natural restoration is highly unlikely.
The other two species, the Weatherfish and the Crucian Carp are very good indicators. In our
project, we propose the Weatherfish for the assessment of the wetland state, while the C'rucian
Carp cannot be used as such an indicator because of its small numbers, and is therefore pointed
in the Level I monitoring - rare species population monitoring.
Distribution of the monitoring species along the Bulgarian section of the Danube water between
1960 and 1962:
* Umbra krameri - not found (still not described as part of the Bulgarian fauna)
* Carassius carassius - not found
* Misgurnusfossilis - not found
* Abramis balleris - 1 specimens - Village of Ostrov (661 river km)

V.7. HEAVY METALS BIOACCUMULATION
The plan suggested below is basically developed on the Wachs (1998) although it was not pro-
posed for the limnic zone (the current) of the River Danube can be used, with some adjustments,
as one of the indicator species for the Danube marshlands as well.

IV                    extremely high pollution                    red
A detailed monitoring survey can be conducted after it is accepted as necessary that such should
exist. Then a more detailed description would be possible of the method, the criteria of pollution
class detenmining, etc.
Depending on weather heavy metals accumulation will be monitored in the bioresorce species
(those used by man) or their bioaccumulation in the ecosystem, different indicator fish species
are proposed.
In case of bioresource species the Carp is suggested, but as far as various flooding alternatives,
or rather the hydrological regime changes will determine the different bioresource species, it re-
mains possible for indicators to be chosen among the others - the Roach (Rutilus rutilus) for ex-
ample.
In case of bioaccumulation of the system, three fish species are suggested from three different
ecological groups
* Sunbleak (Leucaspiuls delinieatus) - short life-cycle - 1-3 years, feeds on plankton;
* Prussian Carp (Carassius gibelio) - comparatively long life-cycle, all-eating benthofagus
* Pike (Esox lucius)- long life cycle - eats fish.

VI. CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESS-
MENT
1. There is some risk that the restoration of wetlands may not lead to reduction of pollution
(especially regarding biogenic elements such as nitrogen and phosphorous) and may not lead to
the expected increase in fish resources in both regions. We expect moderate purifying and trap-
ping of pollutants (mainly biogenic elements) by the restored wetlands. The reason for this is that
in order to preserve the naturalness of flooding, no fine adjustment of the hydrological regime
would be possible as is the case in the use of artificial wetlands to purify wastewater.
Impact mitigation measures: This is not a true ecological impact but should be considered, nev-
ertheless. A technical solution is proposed to ensure a annual flooding for around 60 days (45 at
the least) which would be sufficient for successful spawning of fish and for inflowing of signifi-
cant volumes of water from the Danube to be treated by the water vegetation. Another important
measure is the careful design of the inflow and outflow sluices ensuring unhindered passing of
juvenile and adult fishes during their sping-time migration. We recommend construction of spe-
cial fish ladders for the less agile fishes from the lower stretch of the Danube. Regarding fish re-
sources, the wetlands should be provided with such an aquatic regime as to be able to feed the
Danube with larvae and juvenile fish. Regarding the improved purification capacity of these wet-
lands, a plan for the optimal management of the water in the floodplains in consideration of the
water level in the river should be elaborated. Also, we recommend the removal of all possible
organic waste from the project area in order to reduce the limited loading of the flooded areas.
2. Risk of flooding and negative impacts by the ground water on arable and non-arable land,
buildings, irrigation and drainage structures, roads etc. We consider the risk of negative impacts
by ground water in both project areas very high during the spring because of the possible impact
on agricultural lands and of the different ownership of land.
Impact mitigation measures: (i) A compensation system should be provided for and agreed upon
with the owners of land in order to avoid any possible social tensions (especially in the Kalimok-
Brushlen area). (ii) The technical project should stress upon the inland protection such as small
dykes, drainage canals etc. (iii) Drawing up of a technical solution for continued functioning of
the remaining part of the drainage system upstream of Kalimok-Brushlen which prevent flooding
of the large agricultural lands west of the project area, and the drainage system in the westem
part of Belene island managed by the prison.
3. Health risk - increased population of mosquitoes, risk of malaria and pollution of fish prod-
ucts. Although no significant increase in mosquitoes in both areas is expected, it could occur in
years of deteriorated water regime. For example, the zero altemative provides for the most fa-
vorable ecological conditions for massive breeding of mosquitoes (drying shallow puddles with-
out a sufficient number of natural predators such as fish and aquatic invertebrates). There is a
very low risk of malaria. It is possible that due to global warming, vectors and new sources of
contagion could be transferred from the south. The pollution of fish with toxic substances should
not be different from that in the Danube, but the data is still insufficient.
Impact mitigation measures: (i) Elaboration of a mosquito management plans for both areas us-
ing a combination of biological and chemical control measures. (ii) Introduction of the European
standards for control of fish products.

VII. CONCLUSION
Thc in-dcpth analysis of possible environmental impacts allows for the conclusion that the pro-
posed project complies with the environmental requirements of Bulgaria and of the World Bank
and the restoration is entirely possible with minimal negative impacts on the local population and
on the environment. Any further wetland management would cause significant increasing in the
fish resources with positive economic effects for the local population, restored unique biodiver-
sity and reduced biogenic elements and pollution (although not to a large extent).
The EA team completely accept the remarks in Aide Memoire, Technical Appraisal Mission,
Sofia, December 3-8, 2001 in the field of environmental assessment issues. We appreciate and
support Next Steps and Actions, especially the stated water modeling, which will be realized by
the RIZA institute (The Netherlands).
We draw a special attention to Kalimok - Brushlen project area where according to our team the
wetland restoration altemative is still unclear. We support the idea for restoration including the
Brushlen and Tarchila marshes taking into account all the recommendations for guaranteeing the
stakeholders interest.

VIII. PUBLIC HEARING OF THE PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENT IMPACT AS-
SESSMENT REPORT
The Public Hearings were carried out individually for each of the 2 project areas.
> For the Persina Nature Park - in the town of Belene, 30.01.2002
< For the Kalimok Brashlen Protected Site - in the village of Slivo Pole, 31.01.2002
The Participants List is given in Annex I.
VIII.1. GENERAL IMPRESSION
The following conclusions can be drawn based on the good representation of the stakeholders,
their activity and participation as well as the overall discussion:
1. A sustainable interest in the Project, its development and future is generated - representatives
of the main stakeholders, some of which are regular participants in the meetings, took part in
the event. The presence of the local authorities (mayors of towns and villages) was expressed
very well. In addition, the Public Hearings were chaired by high-ranked representatives of
the local authorities - the Deputy Mayor for the Persina Nature Park (in the town of Belene)
and the Deputy Governor of the Rouse region for the Kalimok-Brashlen Protected Site (in
the village of Slivo Pole).
2. The Project is considered "feasible" - the No Action Alternative was not mentioned at all by
the local stakeholders and not commented upon. Moreover, the Project provokes certain ex-
pectations and even concrete activities - the Municipality Council of Belene has already de-
termined a site for a Danube City Park, the development of which is dependent on the Pro-
ject's implementation.
3. The discussions were carried out in a friendly and constructive manner; there was a good dia-
logue and no contradictions.
4. The necessity of a concrete technical design for the restoration that would help determine the
affected physical and juridical persons was underlined, especially for the Kalimok--Brashlen
Protected Site.
5. There is a serious necessity of broad-scale public awareness rising campaign in order to pre-
vent speculations with the Project, to show the national importance of the Project and to con-
tinue to attract the local people.

* main ecological benefits (restoration of the past ecological balance, fishing, disappear-
ance of amorpha, minimal ecological risk);
* conditions required to reach these benefits and the relevant recommendations of the
consultant team including these on the construction works.
Dipl. Eng. Siyka Vasileva - licensed EIA expert, ACG Ltd.
Elucidates the effects of the restoration on the existing infrastructure, stressing on the need to

ecological issues: construction debris, disposal sites, places (careers) from where soil for the ris-
ing of the dikes will be taken.
Mrs. Stela Ivanova - licensed EIA expert, ACG Ltd.

Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova
Summarizes the Project from both ecological and social points of view - overall positive effects,
identified possible negative impacts and proposed mitigation measures. Information on how the
issues raised during the previous visit (Dec. 15, 2001) was reflected in the presented version of
the EIA Report.
VIII.2.2.    QUESTIONS, ANSWERS AND COMMENTS
Question  (Boyko Razgev) Will the deepening of the marshes (the lowering of their bottoms by
soil excavation) help lower the level of underground waters? Will it ensure a perma-
nent free water surface?
Answer    (Stoyan Mihov) This will put the ecosystem to stress. A depth of 1,2 - 1,5 m is re-
quired in order for a permanent free water surface to be formed. In our case no per-
manent free water surface is needed. As it was already mentioned in the presentation,
the ACG Ltd. team recommends that the restored areas be kept as close to the natural
conditions as possible. The deepening is not recommended for the following reasons:
1. The natural status of the ccosystem will be perturbed and it will be put to stress during the
excavation works.
2. The permanent free water surface is not recommended as the lack of regular drying of the
area will tolerate the development of mosquitoes larvae, swamp snails and "weed" (non-
native) fish species.
3. In order for this free water surface to be permanent, it should be no less than 1,5 m deep; the
reed reappears and grows without a problem at smaller depths. Anyway, deepening is only a
temporary solution for the bottom will be filled in again in quite a short time because of the
nature of the soil.
4. The main problem is where to dispose of this nutrient enriched soil. No doubt it cannot be
used to rise the protective dikes or similar constructions. On the other hand, it should not be
neglected that the project area is situated on an island from where it will be quite difficult to
remove tons of organic and soil matter.

5. The process of excavation and deepening is quite expensive itself and economically not rea-
sonable.
Question  (Christina Panovska, RIEW Pleven) How will the opening of the dikes influence the
natural processes of siltage? What is the speed of silting up of the marshes?
Answer    (Stoyan Mihov) The aim of the restoration and our expectations are that the process
of silting up will be slowed down. The succession is a natural process that leads to
the gradual silting up of lakes and, as a result, to their disappearance. The floods of
the Danube River slowed the succession in the past. The whole eastern part of the is-
land was flooded at high water level at that time and the strong flow carried away the
accumulated in summer dead organic matter. The construction of the dike terminated
the process and the organic matter has been accumulating in the wetlands for decades
by now, unable to be removed by its natural process. This is the reason for the rising
of the bottom of the wetlands. It is expected that the restoration of the connection to
the river will slow down the succession processes in the marshes, once again includ-
ing the organic matter in the natural circle of elements.
The administration of the Prison on the Belene Island (in the person of Mr. Petar Dobrev) ex-
pressed its statement, made concrete recommendations and asked concrete questions. It was
agreed that these questions concern not only the El Assessment but also the Project as a whole:
Question  When is the beginning of the Project's implementation expected? There are multi-
seasonal crops in fields that are to be flooded - the crops will have to be changed or
moved to new places so it is necessary to know the time of starting of the project ac-
tivities. These fields total 6000 dekars arable land and there will be significant losses
unless timely precautions are taken.
Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Explains the expected forthcoming development of the
Project and that the earliest flooding can be expected in autumn 2004.
Comment (Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova) Is it real that from 1290 ha area that is expected to be
flooded 600 dekars arable land?
Comment (Mr. Petar Dobrev) This estimation is made based on the proposed restoration maps
and on personal experience.
Question  (Mr. Petar Dobrev) Could the proposed liquidation of Object 2 be avoided?
Answer    (Mr. Stoyan Mihov) This is not of the competence of the EIA consultancy; the ques-
tion should rather be addressed to the technical team that has developed the restora-
tion scenarios. ACG Ltd. believes that the liquidation or the movement of C)bject 2 is
not compulsory. The Prison could use it during the dry period. However, ACG Ltd.
strongly recommends that the stored there organic matter (manure, etc.) be removed.
Another recommendation is to use the road on the northern protective dike to access
Object 2 rather than the one that crosses the island along its long axis. According to
the predictions of the technical team, the latter will be flooded at level of 20 m. It is
also recommended that the possibility of destroying the concrete road leading to Ob-
ject 2 (which now divides the island into 2 parts along its long axis and which will
not be used after the restoration has taken place) be considered, so that the road will
not block the free movement and exchange of water.
Question  (Mr. Petar Dobrev) The existence of the pumping station "Persin 2" is important as it
drains agricultural lands of the Prison. Isn't there a possibility to dismantle and re-
move the station instead of destroying it, as is recommended by the technical team?

Analytical Creative Group LTD
Answer    (Mrs. Siyka Vasileva) The preliminary El Assessment draws special attention to the
fact that the lands outside the wetlands should remain drained. For that purpose, the
construction of a new draining pumping station might be necessary. It could be
equipped with the installations from "Persin 2" or with new ones.
Question  (Mr. Petar Dobrev) Where will be the soil for the rising of the dikes taken from?
Answer    (Mrs. Siyka Vasileva) The quantities of the soil required for the purpose as well as
the careers from where it will be taken have not been determined so far. We suggest
that this be done along with the construction works design that is to be carried out in
the next phase of the Project.
Question  (Mr. Petar Dobrev) Where will the terrestrial animals go after the actual restoration
of the project area? Won't the pushing out of the wild animals from these lands, as-
sociated with the flooding, and their concentration in the remaining smaller area
cause health risk, for example - isn't it dangerous that rats will spread diseases
among the farm animals and people?
Answer    (Mr. Stoyan Mihov) Fear that the entrance of water into the restored wetlands will
push the wild animals to the farms and buildings of the Prison is not sound. It must
be pointed out once again that the flooding resulting from the restoration will not ex-
ceed the present level of flooding caused by infiltration of water under the dike. The
natural ecosystems are very fine balanced and the restoration of the natural state of
the territory will rather decrease than increase the populations of such human-
associated species as rats. The main goal of the restoration is to create better living
conditions for the inhabitants of the island by restoring the natural environment, and
not to push them out.
Comment The health risk should not be underestimated and new serious studies must be under-
taken to assess it.
Answer    (Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova) The carried out studies and the assessment of the health
risk treat the typical diseases associated with this type of water bodies. Medical ex-
perts made them and, based on the recommendations from the previous meetings, a
veterinary expertise was included in the report. The position of the team is that the
restoration will neither increase the existing nor cause new health risks. However, we
strongly suggest that the Management Plan of the Park include monitoring and pre-
vention of the determined risks in order to liquidate any possible source of disease in
time. They should be monitored closely during the construction works as well.
(Mr. Stoyan Mihov) We share the point of view that a public awareness raising cam-
paign must be carried out in order to clarify the current level of infectious diseases to
the local people. It will cut any speculations and will help avoid the negative attitude
of the local people during the restoration, e.g. if presently there are 2 cases of lepto-
spirosis per year, a single one during the restoration works will be referred to as re-
sulting from the Project. It is believed not only that the health risk will not increase in
the project areas but even more - there will be much more possibilities (including fi-
nancial) to reduce the current risks under the Project.
Question  (Deputy Mayor of the town of Belene) Won't the restoration of wetlands lead to in-
crease in the mosquitoes population?
Answer    Mosquitoes are quite a serious problem even now. The restoration will neither in-
crease nor decrease the mosquito population. However, measures to control the mos-
quitoes (to be funded by the Project) may be included in the Management P'lan of the
Environmental Assessment                                                       83

Park. The colleagues from the team responsible for the development of the Manage-
ment Plan presented a German case study and explained the method in general dur-
ing the previous meeting.
Question  Can the water supply tower on the island and the access road to it be preserved? It
will be necessary to strengthen also the pipe that supplies the tower with water in or-
der to grant the constant supply of water to the Prison. This could be accomplished
through deepening of the wells to the project depth of 18 m.
Answer    (Mrs. Siyka Vasileva) Based on your reasons we support and recommend to keep the
access to the tower and to the water supply system throughout the whole year.
Question  Do the planned activities take into consideration the capabilities of the only bridge
connecting the island to the bank'? It is decommissioned military pontoon bridge, al-
lows only for one-way traffic and can stand as much as 40 t at a time. The existing
road network leading to the bridge and the one on the island are also in bad condi-
tion.
Answer    (Mrs. Siyka Vasileva) The organization and the implementation of the construction
works will be regulated by a project. The latter will be compliant with the access re-
gime to the island and with the capabilities of the existing bridge.
Question  (Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova) Is it possible that the administration of the Prison pre-
pares detailed technical characteristics of the bridge and gives it to the Project Prepa-
ration Unit (PPU)?
Answer    (administration of the Prison) Its is possible and the information will be supplied to
the PPU.
Question  (Mr. Petar Dobrev) What will be the Prison's compensation fort the opportunity costs
of agriculture and farming in the areas to be flooded?
Answer    (Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova) There are no real possibilities for compensation as the
Prison is state owned and its main activity is not connected with economical profits.
However, the ACG Ltd. team suggests that all affected by the restoration land users
have equal access to the financial assistance from the transition fund that will be es-
tablished within the Project. This would allow the Prison to continue its economical
activities and keep its social and educational effects on Prisoners. Of course, it must
be considered that there will be changes in the economical activities of the Prison - it
will be regulated by the Management Plan of the Persina Nature Park.
Question  (administration of the Prison) Is it possible that we are supplied with the complete
documentation on the Project preparation? We know the territories perfectly and we
could express our opinion and make concrete assessments.
Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) It is possible. Unfortunately we have only the complete
report of the previous consultant team at present. It will be possible for you to get
familiar with all Project's details after the additional modeling and the completion of
the technical project for the restoration.
Comment (administration of the Prison): The guarding of the island from water is a problem.
Most probably there will be a lot of poachers accessing the island by boat.
Question (Mrs. Christina Panovska) Where has the soil for the construction of the existing
dikes been taken from? It would be of use to study the history of their construction.

Answer    (Mr. Boyko Razgev and administration of the Prison) Soil from the island has been
used.
Comment (Director of Persina NP) I think that information must be asked from the Plrison for
all the proposed steps and activities. The people there are the only ones that have a
clear view on the situation and will be of great help.
VIII.3. PUBLIC HEARING IN SLIVO POLE, 31.01.2002
The meeting had a similar beginning to the one in the town of Belene. Here Mr. Evgeny Marinov
- the Deputy Governor of the Rouse region, chaired it.
VIII.3.1.    PRESENTATIONS
Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova - Project Manager, PPU
General presentations of the Project, its recent phase, the progress achieved, the changes and the
agreements that were reached during the December mission.
Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova - Managing Director, ACG Ltd.
Presentations of the goals and objectives of the preliminary Environment Impact Assessment and
of the team that has competed it.
Mr. Stoyan Mihov - expert ecologist, ichthyologist, ACG Ltd.
Presentations of the key findings of the ecological assessment and the position of the consultant
team. Explanation of the arguments why ACG Ltd. would not support any of the proposed resto-
ration scenarios. Recommendation to design a new scenario that will be reasonable from both
ecological and social points of view. An Old Russian topographic map from 1886 was presented.
The card gives clear impression on the location of the marshes prior to the construction of the
dike. In this context a special attention was paid to the main aspect of restoration.
There are several recommendations to the restoration:
1. The restoration must be as close as possible to the status presented by the old map but in
smaller scale as the level of the Danube is much lower than it was 100 years ago. That's why
no more than 60 days of free water surface are expected.
2. A restoration as close to the past status as possible means that the Brushlen marsh should be
restored, too.
3. The creation of direct natural connection to the river is a must. There will not be any pump-
ing from the river into the wetlands and no artificial enlargement of the wetlands.
4. The restored wetlands will not cover areas other than the ones currently flooded by infiltra-
tion of water under the dike.
5. The construction of sluices is obligatory. They will have to meet many requirements.
6. The opinion of the mayor of the village of Nova Cherna that the "southern channel" must be
deepened and strengthened is reflected in the present report.
Prior to the end of Mr. Mihov's presentation, Mr. Evgeny Marinov - the Deputy Governor for
the Rouse region - changed the discussion mode and insisted on asking questions on the presen-
tations so far. He believed that would help making a discussion. For that reason two main themes
were discussed further:

* An accent on broad range of general issues related to the Project as a whole at the early
stage;
* Focusing on main issues related to ecological and social assessments at the later stage.
The general issues treated:
* International experience in wetlands restoration;
* Financing of the Project, protection against misappropriation, good coordination between
the Ministry of Environment and Water (MoEW) and the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF);
* The overall budget and the allocations for the different activities - partners, donors' re-
quirements, exact sums;
* Official promotion of the Project in the massmedia as soon as possible. A misrepresenta-
tion in the media might result from misunderstanding of the goals of the Project and lack
of coordination between the responsible institutions. The question who is responsible for
the Project's official presentation in the public space and what will be the procedure to
provide information regarding the Project;
* Information and media policy of the Project as a whole.
Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova provided detailed answers to the above questions. On behalf of ACG
Ltd., Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova informed the meeting of the presence of an international con-
sultant in her team and of the keystones in his expertise, related to international experience,
benefits of wetlands and their ability to reduce nutrient loads.
VIII.3.2.    QUESTIONS, ANSWERS AND COMMENTS
The main issues related to the ecological and social assessments were:
Question  (Mr. Evgeny Marinov) Are there similar projects for the Danube basin for restoration
only of the two Bulgarian marshes looks quite insufficient for the reduction of the
nutrient loads of the Danube?
Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Presents the similar projects in other Danube riparian
countries. Reveals the significance of the Bulgaria Wetlands Restoration and Pollu-
tion Reduction Project in the light of the Strategic Partnership to reduce the nutrient
loads the Danube and Black Sea basins.
Question  (Mr. Evgeny Marinov) Will the Project have a demonstration role? Shall not only the
ecological effect but also the public opinion and attitude be considered?
Question  (Mr. Evgeny Marinov) Will the Project promote practices that will stop the mangane
pollution?
Answer    (Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova) The assessment made by ACG Ltd. includes both the
ecological and the social effects. Mrs. Kostadinova informs in details of 1) all the so-
cial studies carried out as well as the methodology used; 2) identification of positive
effects and negative impacts of the Project and 3) suggested mitigation measures to
reduce the negative impacts.
Question (Mr. Philip Vassilev) What will happen to the fish farms in the region of the villages
Staro Selo and Nova Cherna?

Analtical Creative Grouip LTD
Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Explains that the goal of the Project is the restoration of
the wetlands and not of the fish farm. The Green Balkans NGO consigned the fish-
ponds to the Project and no problems are expected from that direction.
Answer    (Mr. Stoyan Mihov) The fish farm is not functional nowadays. It is situated exactly
in the area where the formation of the free water surface is expected. The internal
dikes between the fisponds will hinder the natural flow of water and the natural
flooding of the area. For that reason the dikes will have to be cut in several places. It
will be best to completely remove them but this is impossible because of the great
volumes of earth that will have to be removed. Anyway, the exact design of the cut-
ting is again a decision of the team developing the restoration scenarios.
Question  (Mr. Philip Vassilev) At what intervals will be opened the protective dike along the
Danube?
Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Additional studies will have to be carried out in April (at
high water level) to determine at what intervals the protective dike shall be open.
Answer    (Mr. Stoyan Mihov) What is for sure is that the protective dike will not simply be de-
stroyed to let water in. Specially designed inlet sliuces will be constructed in 2
places.
Question  (Mr. Philip Vassilev) What will be done to preserve the agricultural lands?
Question  (Mr. Philip Vassilev) What will be done to solve the problem with mosquitoes?
Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Additional dikes will be constructed to protect the arable
lands neighbouring the project areas. No drainage pumping stations will be de-
stroyed. If necessary, additional drainage channels may be built.
Question  (Mr. Reyhan Ablihim) Is the water of the Danube good enough for environment
friendly agriculture?
Question  (Mr. Reyhan Ablihim) Is there a possibility that the restored wetlands will turn to de-
pots for heavy metals carried by the Danube waters?
Answers   (Mr. Todor Moskov) I can assure you that the Regional Inspectorate of Environment
and Water takes samples from the Danube every month. The analyses do not show
any excess of the MAC. There is certain excess only in sediments at some spots but
there is no way that they enter the flooded areas.
Question  (Mr. Reyhan Ablihim) Will the management of the Project be good enough to grant
the benefits for the local people?
Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Gives information on the coordination between the
MOEW and the MAF and on the planned meetings.
Comment (Mr. Todor Moskov) I think that 60 days of flooding are not enough. The free water
surface must be granted troughout the whole year.
Answer    (Mr. Stoyan Mihov) The ACG Ltd. team recommends that the restored areas be kept
as close to the natural conditions as possible. The deepening is not recommended for
the following reasons:
1. The natural status of the ecosystem will be perturbed and it will be put to stress during the
excavation works. Populations of globally threatened species were discovered in the project
area and they must be conserved.

2. The permanent free water surface is not recommended as the lack of regular drying of the
area will tolerate the development of mosquitoes larvae, swamp snails and "weed" (non-
native) fish species. There will be enough free water in the channels.
3. In order for this free water surface to be permanent, it should be no less than 1,5 m deep; the
reed reappears and grows without a problem at smaller depths. Anyway, deepening is only a
temporary solution for the bottom will be filled in again in quite a short time because of the
nature of the soil.
4. The main problem is where to dispose of this nutrient enriched soil. No doubt it cannot be
used to rise the protective dikes or similar constructions. On the other hand, it should not be
neglected that the project area is situated on an island from where it will be quite difficult to
remove the hundreds of tons of organic matter.
5. The process of excavation and deepening is quite expensive itself and economically not rea-
sonable.
6. The alternative suggesting the construction of several deep ponds that would connect to each
other by means of a canal was commented at the previous meeting. It was agreed then that
this option would not support biodiversity and does not correspond to the goals of the Pro-
ject.
Question  Could the present consultant team meet journalists and provide correct information
about the Project?
Answer   (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Presentation of the Project is not a responsibility of the
consultant teams. This is right and obligation of the PPU.
Comment (Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova) If our assistance is needed we could help the PPU with
the realization of the public campaign.
Question  (Mr. Venko Yordanov) What will be the restrictions regarding fishing?
Answer   (Mr. Stoyan Mihov) We would not like to undertake any obligations regarding the
fishing. What will be the restrictions and will there be restrictions at all will be de-
termined by the Management Plan of the Kalimok-Brashlen Protected Site. When
we mentioned that the access of fishermen might be restricted we envisaged the res-
toration might lead to flooding of some of their paths to the Danube bank, thus forc-
ing them to change their paths to the tones along the bank or the way of accessing
them.
Comment (Mr. Venko Yordanov) Don't worry about that - even now fishermen use boats to
access the tones.
Question  (Mr. Venko Yordanov) Is there any coordination between the Project and the team
responsible for the strengthening of the riverbank?
Answer   (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Their work will not be affected in any way. The river-
bank will be strengthened as before.
Question  (Mr. Boris Ivanov) When will you inform the people in the villages of the concrete
project activities and which lands will be affected? Without this information and
without concrete maps there is no sense in any more meetings - personally I am not
willing to attend them any more.
Question (Mr. Boris Ivanov) Are there any activities planned for April 2002? This is the proper
time to measure the water level and to determine the threatened lands.

Answer    (Mrs. Marietta Stoimenova) Explains the next steps of the Project and assures the
mayors that they will be given more informnation as soon as the concrete technical
design for the restoration is elaborated.
Question  (Mr. Boris Ivanov) I would like to raise the issue of the mosquitoes once again.
Answer    (Mr. Stoyan Mihov) As I already mentioned, mosquitoes are quite a serious problem
even now. The restoration will neither increase nor decrease the mosquito popula-
tion. However, the Management Plan of the Protected Site will provide measures (in-
cluding financial) to control the mosquitoes.
Mrs. Snejana Kostadinova summarized the accents from the statements and the suggestions in
order to grant their correct reflection in the report.
VIII.3.3.    CONCLUSIONS
The audience agreed to the following conclusions:
Mr. Evgeny Marinov, Deputy Governor:
7. An adequate public information campaign must be implemented in order to prevent any pos-
sible speculations with the Project.
8. The Project should finance the expenses on the mosquito treatment methodology.
9. The local people must have priority as employees for the implementation of the Project ac-
tivities.
10. The benefits of the Project must be presented in exact numbers - number of new working
places, wages, etc.
Mr. Venko Yordanov, Chairman of the Municipality Council of the village of Slivo pole:
The underground water levels should be studied in details and the risk of flooding adjacent ar-
able lands should be minimized.
Mr. Reyhan Ablihim, Mayor of the village of Goliamo Vranovo:
We support both the ecological and the social assessments. We insist on checking the registers of
the Employment Office in Slivo Pole and if there are suitable people they must be given the
chance to work.
Mr. Boris Ivanov, Mayor of the village of Nova Cherna:
We do not object to the Project. We support the assessments but we insist to have all the details
of the technical design for the restoration.
When planning the next meetings please have in mind that Thursday is not suitable day for us -
we are having a session of the Municipal Council on Thursdays.
Mr. Assen Tonchev, Mayor of the village of Brushlen:
I suggest that the administration of the Project be situated in the village of Brmshlen. There are a
couple of reasons for that: first, our village is situated in the middle of the Protected Area and the
Protected Area is named after our village and, second, we have convenient premises - the build-
ing of the former kindergarten. The building offers good functional and communication
possibilities.
