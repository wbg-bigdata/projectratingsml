F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the Municipal Heating Project is to alleviate the financial burden
on municipal governments associated with the supply of district heating to the local
population by: (i) improving the operating efficiency of district heating systems through
investments to save energy and reduce heat losses; (ii) promoting sound cost recovery
policies and commercial practices; and (iii) supporting government efforts to improve the
cost-effectiveness of subsidy programs through better targeting and delivery of subsidies
to low-income households.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Sector Background: The breakdown of the Soviet economic system in late 1991
and the transition to a market economy had proved particularly difficult for many of the
infrastructure services in Russia. The problems in the heating sector were exacerbated by an old
infrastructure that was designed without regard for energy efficiency and by a perception that
municipal heating was a public service which should be supplied on non-commercial terms,
particularly in light of the general hardships associated with the transition. As a result, the heating
sector faced a number of major issues, including:

·        Lack of investment funds. Municipal funding was scarce, at least in part because of
inadequate tariffs for heat supply. In addition, the sector was not attractive to private sector
investments owing to the lack of a suitable legal and regulatory framework, low profit potential,
high investment needs, and high risks both at the country and the local level.

·        Generally high cost of supply. The infrastructure had been poorly maintained and was
inefficiently designed and operated due to the lack of guiding price signals. Downstream
infrastructure was characterized by high heat and water losses.

·        Inflexible technical design (constant flow/variable temperature). The system was supply
driven. Consumers had virtually no control over their heat consumption or comfort level.

·        Inadequate tariffs. Typically, district heating tariffs did not provide sufficient cost
recovery to provide for sustainable operations of the networks. Depreciation, which was based on
outdated asset values, was insufficient to provide adequate cash flow for asset replacement.

·        Arrears. Non-payment was generally high, often due to lack of payment
discipline and lack of available remedies, or willingness to use available remedies.

Rationale for Bank assistance: The Country Assistance Strategy1 (CAS) (December 1, 1999) and
CAS progress report (February 6, 2001) focused on an interim program for assistance during
what was expected to be a difficult period in terms of promoting a long-term reform agenda in
Russia. It reaffirmed the need for a long-term relationship; focused on poverty reduction by re-
establishing foundations for growth and strengthening targeted social safety nets; focused on
institutional barriers to growth and governance issues; and, specified an intensive portfolio
management to improve impact in the Bank's lending program. Among the targeted areas of Bank
assistance were three critical areas of fiscal management: (i) intergovernmental fiscal
arrangements; ( ii) sub-national fiscal management; and (iii) analysis of expenditure efficiency.
The project addressed in particular the issue of sub-national fiscal management, where the CAS
objective was to "strengthen financial management policies and practices at these levels of
government". It also addressed expenditure analysis, which was to "focus primarily on efficiency

and equity issues in expenditures for education, health, and social protection". In addition, the
project would contribute to an improved standard of living in selected cities by improving the
quality and reliability of heat supply and by supporting the redirection of subsidies towards low-
income households.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The overall objective of the project was to alleviate the financial burden on municipal
governments associated with the supply of district heating to the local population by: (i)
improving the operating efficiency of district heating systems through investments to save energy
and reduce heat losses; (ii) promoting sound cost recovery policies and commercial practices; and
(iii) supporting government efforts to improve the cost-effectiveness of subsidy programs through
better targeting and delivery of subsidies to low-income households.

Key Indicators were: (i) Reduced fuel and water consumption; (ii) Reduced heat losses; (iii)
Promoting sound cost recovery to cover costs, adequate maintenance etc.; (iv) Collection rate to
reach 100%; and (v) Better targeted and more adequate subsidies.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The objective was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The beneficiaries of the project included:

·        Heating companies. Benefits to participating heating companies would include: (i)
extension of the life of heating network assets; (ii) reduced fuel consumption through more
efficient equipment and reduced losses; (iii) more efficient delivery of heat through better
temperature controls and upgrading of substations; (iv) reduced operation and maintenance costs,
as well as avoided investment in pipes and substations; and (v) improved quality of heating
services.

·        Consumers. The heating customers (primarily households and institutions) in areas of the
municipalities which were being rehabilitated would benefit from lower heating costs.

·        Municipalities would benefit from the reduction in subsidy burdens placed on municipal
administrations, and also lower levels of heating-related costs to be paid by them.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project consisted of four components as follows:

Component 1. System Rehabilitation. Original cost: US$70.36 million

The system rehabilitation component of the project included a number of high-priority
investments in repairing and replacing sections of the district heating systems in the participating
cities and upgrading these sections to modern more efficient technology. While the investments
program varied from city to city, depending on needs, the project generally included such


                                                 2

investments as replacing central heat substations (CHS) with building-level individual heat
substations (IHS) and converting from a four-pipe to a two-pipe system, upgrading selected CHS
by replacing heat exchangers and adding automated control systems, replacing sections of the
transmission and distribution networks with pre-insulated pipes, boiler replacement, metering,
and network re-design to optimize the efficiency of supply.

Component 2: Technical Assistance - Procurement, Engineering, Supervision. Original
cost: US$4.10 million

This component would provide support to the Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU) in
project implementation. While the consultants would be expected to work in and together with
the cities, their primary responsibility would be to assist the CPIU in ensuring that the projects
were carried out in a timely and efficient manner, in compliance with procurement guidelines and
with best practices for design, engineering and installation. The Procurement and Engineering
Group (PEG) would be selected in accordance with the terms of reference included in the Project
Implementation Plan. It would assist in elaboration of the bidding documents of all investments in
the project, and in carrying out procurement functions in accordance with the provisions of the
Loan Agreement and the Bank's Guidelines.

Component 3: Central Project Implementation. Original cost: US$ 2.90 million

The CPIU set up in the National Foundation for Housing Reform would manage and supervise
project implementation on behalf of Gosstroi, the federal agency responsible for the project. The
CPIU would be the main link with the Bank and fully responsible for ensuring that the project
was implemented efficiently in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement. This
project component also included financial audit of the project accounts maintained by the CPIU,
together with a review of the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure. In addition, it
would include funding for monitoring of the creditworthiness and the solvency of the
participating cities.

Component 4: Institutional Support. Original cost: US$2.50 million.

This component was targeted to support the overall development of the district heating and
communal services sector through focused research on areas of particular relevance to achieving
desired sector reforms. In particular, studies would focus on: (i) options and actions necessary to
improve pricing and regulation; (ii) assessment of restructuring options for the sector (including
the potential role of competition and the promotion of greater private sector involvement)
together with detailed action plans to advance this process; (iii) assessment of financial structures
and mechanisms which would ensure an appropriate and equitable flow of benefits to investors in
the sector (including municipalities); and (iv) assessment of energy cost-related issues of social
protection for low-income families.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes




                                                 3

There were no changes in the project's design, scope and scale, and implementation arrangements.
However, there were changes in the project's schedule, and funding allocation as mentioned
below:

Project Schedule. The schedule of the project was revised twice. The closing date of the project
was extended first by 18 months from June 30, 2006 to December 31, 2007 because the majority
of participating cities were not able to complete the scheduled works before the original closing
date. The main reasons for this were identified as delay in Effectiveness, lengthy evaluation
procedures, and (in some cases) prolonged winters that limited the period within which works
could be physically executed. It was extended for a second time for a period of an additional six
months (through June 30, 2008) in order to complete the activities in the three participating cities
- Krasnoyarsk, Volgograd, and Neryungri, which had the largest undisbursed amounts. If not
financed from the loan, these activities would be at significant risk of remaining incomplete,
thereby jeopardizing the positive results achieved thus far under the project.

Funding Allocation. An amount of $6.80 million was reallocated in August 2005 from the
Category (6) "Unallocated" to the Category (2) "Goods, including local transportation and related
insurance". This amount was reallocated to the city of Tambov as it needed more money to carry
out project activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

During preparation, the project design took into account lessons learned from previous Bank-
assisted projects in the energy sector in Russia and other countries. Likewise, the design
considered the risk factors and appropriate measures were adopted to mitigate all major risks
identified at appraisal. The project also provided a participatory framework involving
stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the decision-making processes.

Lessons learned from previous Bank-assisted projects. Lessons learned from other Bank-
financed District Heating (DH) related projects under implementation in Poland, Estonia, Latvia,
China, and Ukraine include the findings that:

· Strong project ownership and advanced preparation of project components is necessary for
timely implementation.


                                                 4

· The relationship between prices and incomes changes rapidly in countries in transition, and
the heating service which appears largely unaffordable may become easier to afford in a relatively
short period of time. Rising incomes also affect the local costs, which should not be
underestimated.
· End-user efficiency improvements, which initially appear difficult to support due to building
ownership and affordability reasons, may be possible to support on a pilot level.
· Strong support from municipalities is needed to resolve collections and payment issues.
· Decentralized project management (including management of procurement) usually is more
effective than centralized implementation arrangements. However, a centralized project
implementation unit had proved to be a sound solution in Russia when dealing with rather small
district heating enterprises and municipalities, based on the experiences from the Energy
Efficiency Project.

Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures. The table below shows the risks and mitigation measures
identified in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD).

Adequacy of participatory processes. The project design was based on the results of the Social
Assessment, taking into account the primary concerns of the consumers (largely cost and
reliability of supply). Public consultations about the subprojects were held in the involved cities
no less than two months prior to physical activity on the work sites, and the results of these
consultations (including date and location of consultation, list of participants, and summary
minutes) were provided to the Bank prior to physical activity on the work sites. Discussions
involved residential district heat customers, local social workers and poverty specialists,
universities, staff from district heating companies, city representatives, housing maintenance
organizations, municipal social assistance offices and other civil society stakeholders.

2.2 Implementation

The project was not restructured, and no changes were made to the design. The project was at
`Risk' status until June 2003 because of: (i) late effectiveness of both the main loan and the Sub-
loans to the participating municipalities; and (ii) delayed implementation for the reasons
mentioned below, and the resulting low disbursement. However, the situation improved in 2003
after the Sub-Loan Agreements (SLAs) were made effective with all the participating cities, and
the co-financing from these cities was assured.

The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) of the project in October 2006, and assessed
progress on all project components, the implementation issues being faced, and the actions to be
taken to ensure the successful completion of the project. The following factors affected project
implementation:

Factors outside government control or implementation agency

·        High turnover of Task Team Leaders (TTLs). During the six years of the project, there
were nine TTLs, and in the last three years, there were five TTLs. The frequent changes in TTL
led to lack of continuity, disruption in implementation, and different approaches to the
supervision of implementation.

Factors subject to government control or implementation agency

    · Delay in project effectiveness. The project was declared effective on August 30, 2002, 17
months after it was approved by the Board on March 27, 2001. This delay was because: (i) the
Russian Government only approved the loan for signing on December 18, 2001, nine months
after the Board approval, resulting from the delay in finalizing the text of the SLAs and approving
them; and (ii) loan effectiveness required a minimum of four sub-loans to be signed and given a
satisfactory legal opinion, together with an implementation agreement between Ministry of


                                                   6

Finance (MOF), Gosstroi (State Committee for Construction and Housing Policy), and the
National Foundation for Housing Reform (NFHR), and there was a delay in meeting these
requirements.

·       Delay in SLA effectiveness. As mentioned above, there was substantial delay in the
effectiveness of SLAs. The number of days it took for the SLAs to be effective after the project
became effective were as follows: Dubna (223 days); Mytischi (223 days); Tambov (47 days);
Syzran (206 days); Kazan (47 days); Krasnoyarsk (347 days); Volgograd (242 days); and
Nerungri (202 days). This factor was the major cause for the slow disbursement until 2004.

·       Insufficient capacity of the CPIU. Physical progress of the project in 2004 was slower
than expected ­ in part, due to insufficient capacity of the CPIU to assist the Local Project
Management Units (LPMUs) with the high volume of procurement documentation work. This
was complicated by changes in the local administrations of some cities. New administrations
tended to propose revisions to the investment plans and choice of contractors. The restructuring
of the Federal Government also had contributed to the slowdown as the roles of the key officials
with respect to the project were being clarified.

·       Change of district heat suppliers. In several cities (e.g., Volgograd, Tambov, Syzran),
the district heat suppliers had changed since the time of the signing of the Subproject
Implementation Agreements (SIA). This made the SIAs outdated and created project management
and monitoring problems.

·       In 2004: (i) due to the Budget Code limitation the city of Mytischi was not able to
implement its original procurement plan. The city postponed the procurement plan significantly.
Likewise, the slow decision making process of Krasnoyarsk LPMU delayed the city's investment
plan; and (iii) the city of Syzran stopped implementation of the project due to the co-financing
problems in the city's budget.

·       Suspension of SLAs. The MOF had suspended for sometime all SLAs due to "up-front fee
payments". The SLAs were then amended to allow the cities to use SLA funds for up-front fee
payments. Suspension period ranged from two to five months depending on the city. The
extremely slow bid evaluation process in the CPIU had slowed the implementation and
correspondingly the disbursements from 2003 up to end of 2004. The ability of the CPIU to
handle the evaluation process subsequently improved, and the process itself was significantly
streamlined.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design. The Borrower had agreed to monitor and evaluate the project on an ongoing basis,
in accordance with the indicators set forth in the Loan Agreement. The indicators were closely
linked to the project development objectives and were selected adequately. They were also close
in substance to the indicators originally included in the PAD, but were more specific and easier to
monitor. The indicators were sufficiently detailed to allow for monitoring results by city and by
heating area within each city. This eventually allowed building a sufficiently comprehensive
database for monitoring and analyzing project results, including economic and financial
effectiveness of the investments.


The M&E design also included monitoring the impact of project investments on heat production
costs and the manner in which these were translated into tariffs for the population. Further, the


                                                 7

project aimed to ensure that the cities adhere to commitments of reducing and abolishing
untargeted heat subsidies, thereby freeing up municipal funding for social development and
targeted assistance to the poor. Overall, the M&E design based on the indicators in the Loan
Agreement can be considered adequate, requiring only minor adjustments during project
implementation. Specifically, additional quantitative metrics were introduced for the indicator of
the reduction of level of financial support by the municipalities to the heating companies.


M&E implementation. Throughout project implementation, NFHR collected and reported to the
Bank the quarterly Financial Management Reports (FMRs). While the FMRs were essential for
some monitoring purposes, they were not designed to track the achievement of the project
development objectives. NFHR had started systematically collecting the technical and financial
indicators for the M&E purposes as per the indicators in the Loan Agreement only in 2005.
Remarkable progress was made since then, and a logical framework covering the data for all the
indicators was completed for 2006 and 2007. A detailed database supporting the information of
the logical framework is currently available at NFHR. This database is the source of information
for the Results Framework Analysis in this ICR (Section F).

M&E utilization. The Results Framework proved to be an important monitoring and analytical
tool for both the Bank and the Borrower. Its main value is in the relatively objective and
reasonable basis that it provides for assessing the project results. Its role in decision-making and
resource allocation, however, was limited. This is partly due to the fact that the framework
became available relatively late in the project, but also because other decision-making
mechanisms were thought to be suitable in most cases.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard issues. There were no major safeguard issues related to the implementation of the
project.

Fiduciary issues. Fiduciary compliance was generally satisfactory, except the issue mentioned
below: The Bank decided not to finance one contract in Tambov in 2005, because it was
discovered that the supplier who won the contract, had faked its bid security (bank guarantee),
and consequently, this contract was declared a `Misprocurement'. The then PIU Director was
arrested by the Russian authorities for fraudulent practices, and the matter was investigated by
Department of Institutional Integrity (INT). The Bank had demanded to the MOF that the moneys,
already paid to this supplier, be returned to the project account. Accordingly, an amount
equivalent of  426,241.20 was refunded by the Ministry in April 2008.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

(a)      Transition arrangements.

After the project closure, participating cities and district heating companies would be in a position
to carry on the normal activities for heating services, with the help of the technology and
infrastructure acquired under the project. The staff have developed adequate knowledge, skills,
and technical know-how which would help them in regular operation after project closure.
District heating companies will be responsible for the service and maintenance of installed
Individual Heating Sub-Stations (IHS) and pipes, and the budget for this will come out of the
tariff for all participating cities. It is thus expected that operation and maintenance of the systems
on a day-to-day basis will be carried out by them. The tariff rates calculated by the heating


                                                     8

companies will be monitored by the Federal Agency for Tariff Regulation. On the other hand, it is
likely that the participating cities may not have adequate resources to finance capital investments
after the project closure.

(b) List of performance indicators. The set of monitoring and evaluation indicators used under
the project will continue to be used as part of participating municipalities' regular operations.
(See Results Framework Analysis)

(c) Follow-up projects.

Participating cities and their heating companies are interested in exploring the possibility of
having follow-on projects. For example:

Kazan. Under the Program for Social and Economic Development of Kazan for 2008-2010 and
the Program for District Heating in Kazan (up to 2008), the need for a potential follow-up project
is currently being evaluated, and possibilities for attracting loans (of foreign banks and Russian
banks) are being examined.

Mytischi. Specialists of the Mytischi District have assessed needs for a potential follow-up
project for 34 km of heat mains and distribution networks are to be replaced in six street blocks in
Mytischi (the cost of the component is USD 17.2 million) with installation in parallel of 263
IHSs (the cost of the component is USD 14.5 million).

Tambov. Need for a potential follow-up project has been evaluated and its results have been used
to prepare a feasibility study for a follow-up District Heating Project.

(d) Suggested priority and optimum timing of any future impact evaluation.

It will be important to make an evaluation after two or three years, on whether the energy savings,
and reduction in energy and water losses have been maintained as expected. It will also be
important to evaluate the quality of service provided by the district heating companies, and
whether they are carrying out regular maintenance activities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project's objective is still relevant, and important to Russia's economic development. It is
timely and appropriate to the current needs of the country's heating sector. For example, the
Russian Government has placed high importance on improving housing and communal services
(HCS) provision, and closely links service provision with improving the quality of life. The
Russian Government has declared the reform of the HCS sector as one of its top priority areas.
HCS reform is included in the recently approved Medium-Term Government Program for 2006-
2008, which sets out the country's development priorities. In particular, the priorities include
facilitating private sector participation in housing and communal services, developing targeted
social assistance, and improving and measuring the quality of services provided.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Satisfactory. The project, which was implemented in eight Participating Municipalities2, was
successful in achieving its objective. The following achievements demonstrate the direct
correlation between the project's outputs and their resulting outcomes. (For details and examples
see Annex 10)

(i) Objective 1: Improving the operating efficiency of district heating systems through
investments to save energy and reduce heat losses. Achievement: Satisfactory

     · Quality and energy efficiency of heat and hot water services.

a) Quality of heat and hot water services has improved significantly compared to baseline
conditions. Most project cities have implemented a partial transition to DH systems based on
variable flow of water and automatic temperature control at the building level. This type of
system is more responsive to the needs of the customers.

b) Energy efficiency has improved significantly compared to baseline conditions, where energy
efficiency of the DH systems was poor due to overheating of many customers' premises and high
level of losses in the pipeline networks. In those segments of the DH systems where the cities
introduced variable flow of water and automatic temperature control at the building level, the
level of consumption of heat decreased by about 12-17%, and domestic hot water by about 5-10%,
without sacrifice to the quality of the services.

     · Reduced fuel and water consumption in the project district heating systems

Fuel consumed by the participating heating companies to supply heat from the segments of the
DH systems renovated under the project has decreased by 19.5% from 2230 thousand Gcal/year
in 2002 to 1796 thousand Gcal/year at project completion. In addition, the volume of water
consumed by the participating heating companies to supply heat from the segments of the DH
systems renovated under the project, thousand m3/year, has decreased by 54% from 46535
thousand m3/year in 2002 to 21189 thousand m3/year at project completion.

     · Reduced heat losses in the project district heating systems

Heat lost in the networks by the participating heating companies in the segments of the DH
systems renovated under the project has decreased by 35.5% from 329 thousand Gcal/year to 212
thousand Gcal/year at project completion.

     · Operating cost reduction in comparable inflation-adjusted prices

Operating costs of the participating heating companies to supply heat from the segments of the
DH systems renovated under the project - in comparable inflation-adjusted prices, have decreased
by 26% from 1023 million/year in 2002 to 757 million/year at project completion.




2 Participating Municipalities included: (i) Tambov; (ii) Neryungri; (iii) Krasnoyarsk; (iv) Mytischi District; (v) Kazan;
(vi) Volgograd; (vii) Syzran; and (viii) Dubna.



                                                          10

Objective 2: Promoting sound cost recovery policies and commercial practices. Achievement:
Moderately Satisfactory

    · Cost recovery ratio (%) demonstrating that the district heating charges (tariffs) are set at a
        level sufficient to cover all prudently incurred costs of operation, including depreciation,
        as well as the local costs of sub-projects and a reasonable level of profitability.

With both the tariffs and operating costs rapidly growing, the average ratio of tariff to operating
costs for DH companies in aggregate remains only slightly above 100%. Three out of ten DH
companies still have this ratio below 100%. While achieving a higher cost recovery ratio would
have been desirable, it must be recognized that keeping up the tariff levels with the rapidly
growing costs is an achievement in itself.

    · Level of cost recovery in the tariffs paid by the households

Seven out of ten DH companies have achieved or exceeded the 100% target. The average
percentage across the cities is about 110%. The lowest level of cost recovery in the DH tariffs
paid by the households - 83% - is observed in the city of Neryungri. In 2002, the tariff paid by the
population of the participating cities was about 70% of the average tariff paid by all groups of DH
consumers. It was not greater than 85% in any city.

    · Payment collection ratio to total billings.

The average collection ratio across the cities is about 95%. Five out of ten heating companies
have met the target. In 2002, the average collection ratio across the cities was about 85%

    · Rate of collections in cash.

Levels of cash payments collection are about 100%. In 2002, levels of cash payments collection
were slightly below 100%.


Objective 3: Supporting government efforts to improve the cost-effectiveness of subsidy
programs through better targeting and delivery of subsidies to low-income households.
Achievement: Satisfactory

    · Reduction of level of support of participating heating companies by their municipalities.

a) The total amount of funds spent by all participating cities for heating services (including
subsidies and operating losses of heating companies), in comparable inflation-adjusted prices,
have decreased from 535 RUR million/year in 2002 to 78 RUR million/year at project completion.

b) Percent ratio of municipal payments in the revenues of DH companies has decreased
dramatically from 17% in 2002 to 2.5% at project completion.

    · Better targeting of heating subsidies to low-income households.

Housing allowances are being rapidly phased in as the old municipal heating subsidies delivered
through DH companies can no longer support the low-income population in the conditions of
steadily increasing tariffs for heat and hot water. As a whole, housing allowances are better


                                                 11

targeted than the old DH subsidies (covering today 20 - 25% of the population vs 100% of DH
consumers under the old DH subsidies). However, the overall share of housing allowances as a
proportion of municipal budget expenditures is steadily increasing. No complete set of data could
be obtained to evaluate this trend further.

3.3 Efficiency

To conduct the economic and financial analysis for this ICR, a spreadsheet model was developed
that calculates economic and financial return indicators for investments in each of the 41 heating
regions under modernization in the eight participating cities.

The calculations were based only on those project benefits (savings) that could be expressed in
terms of cash flows. For the years 2002 ­ 2007, savings were based on actual figures from the
project cities. No environmental externalities or social effects of modernization, which
undoubtedly contribute to the project's positive results, have been taken into account.

The results obtained differ considerably by heating region and by city. Payback for individual
investments varies from almost immediate to more than 20 years, the economic and financial
internal rates of return ranging from hundreds percent down to negative values. However, the
aggregate numbers show results either approximating or exceeding those projected in the project
appraisal document (PAD). See Annex 3 for details.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the discussion given in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the overall outcome is rated as satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project has had a positive impact on poverty alleviation. While some wealthier people may
have been able to find alternatives (such as moving to homes with individual heating boilers),
district heating remains the most affordable way of supplying heat and hot water to most urban
population in Russia. Thus, improvements in the quality and reliability of district heating services
are beneficial to all customers of participating municipalities, but especially to the poor, for
whom district heating is the only viable alternative.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact as demonstrated by the
following:

·        The project provided an opportunity to the participating cities to improve the mechanisms
used to manage the district heating system. It also enabled them to acquire new mechanisms for
attracting off-budget funds for implementation of infrastructure projects of urban development,
study modern international approaches to technical rehabilitation, and, more importantly, to
alleviate the burden on the city budget.



                                                 12

·       The project made a substantial contribution to institutional strengthening as the
government and other project participants have gained substantial experience in putting in place
procedures for implementation of complex investment projects.

·       Results of transformations conducted in the district heating system will definitely yield a
long-term technical and economic effect and will reduce the financial burden of the budget with
respect to heat consumption and will enable the consumers to receive high quality heating and
domestic hot water services.

·       The project resulted in training of skilled local specialists, i.e. installers, designers,
engineers and technical specialists that have learned to use modern technologies and heat
supplying equipment. Specialized service companies have been set up in the participating cities to
maintain equipment installed at Central Heating Substations and Individual Heating Substations.

·       Certain Project Participating Cities (Krasnoyarsk, Mytischi, Neryungry, Syzran) have
introduced systems of dispatch control and data collection. These systems are designed for remote
monitoring and management of district heating objects (boiler houses, CHSs, IHSs). Such
systems would allow to improve reliability of heat supply systems and reduce expenses for
maintenance and repair.

·       The project also provided for strengthening of the administration capacity, financial
standing and improvement of heating companies' administration efficiency in the Project
Participating Cities. At the federal and municipal levels the project implementation would
provide for achievement of the following housing and utilities sector reform goals: (a) support to
the housing and utilities reform in Russia in the municipal heating sector; (b) local budgets
restructuring through re-allocation of funds and reduction in the expenses for utilities services, to
include the heat supply services; and (c) addressing the social issues related to the introduction of
targeted subsidies to the low-income groups of population.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There was no unintended outcome or impact of the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Moderate

On the one hand:

·     The equipment procured has better technical performance than the equipment used in the
past, and, therefore, operations and maintenance costs are reduced and the risk of accidents
during the heating season is reduced as well.

·     The contract documentation sets out a legal warranty period of operation and maintenance
of rehabilitated facilities. In addition, experience and technical performance of equipment put in



                                                  13

operation gives the hope that the equipment will have an uninterrupted term of service for some
time, which is 10 years for boiler houses and not less than 35 years for heat mains.

·      Contractual documents legally establish a warranty period for the operation and
maintenance of the reconstructed facilities.

On the other hand:

·        Sharp decline in the overall economic conditions in the country, resulting from the global
world-wide financial crisis started to affect Russia since the Fall of 2008; and a subsequent
sudden drop in the prices of Russia's export commodities such as oil, may become an additional
challenge for keeping the heating tariffs at cost-recovery levels. Currently, there is no assurance
that: (i) there will not be any back-sliding on the tariff levels and subsidy targeting; and (ii) the
quality of the tariff setting process in terms of technical capacity, methodology, and independence
will allow the cost-recovery level to be maintained.

Based on the above factors, the overall risk of not sustaining the project's outcome is rated as
Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was
satisfactory. During preparation and appraisal, the Bank took into account the adequacy of
project design and all major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, and
institutional, including procurement and financial management. A number of alternatives was
considered for the project design. The selected alternative consisted of supporting small and
affordable investments in sound long-term solutions to district heating rehabilitation in a number
of municipalities. In addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier projects in
the social sector were considered and incorporated into the project design.

A Financial Management Capacity Assessment (FMCA) was carried out for the project and
necessary improvements for strengthening the financial management capacity of the project
entities to meet the Bank's requirements were identified and discussed with the counterparts as
part of the FMCA. These improvements were implemented under a time-bound Action Plan and
the Bank's Financial Management Specialist certified the project as meeting minimum financial
management requirements of the Bank.

Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided the
technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a good project design. The Bank
provided adequate resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure quality
preparation and appraisal work. The project was consistent with the CAS and government
priorities in the sector at the time. The Bank had a consistently good working relationship with
the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.



                                                   14

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was moderately satisfactory.
The task team focused on the project's development impact. The Bank allocated sufficient budget
and staff resources, and the project was adequately supervised and closely monitored. The task
team regularly prepared Aide-Memoires, alerted the government and NFHR about issues found
during project execution and facilitated prompt corrective action. The Implementation Status
Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in terms of achievement of
development objectives and project implementation.

Bank's procurement and financial management proficient staff worked with the CPIU-NFHR
staff to explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project implementation, with regard
to procurement of goods and works, and selection of consultants, accounts and audits, based on
the Loan and Project Agreement.

In July 2004, the Bank's Financial Management Unit performed the financial management
supervision of the project within the framework of the general Bank supervision mission. Based
on the results of FM supervision and the results of the review of the 2003 project audited
financial statements, the task team made recommendation for improvements of the contents and
formats of the quarterly and annual reports. The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in
October 2006. Based on the recommendations of the MTR, measures were taken to ensure
improvement in implementation performance. The task team also monitored safeguard and
fiduciary compliances.

On the other hand, as mentioned in Section 2.2, there was a high turnover of TTLs during the
project period was less than satisfactory. During the six years of the project, there were nine TTLs.
These frequent changes created a lack of continuity and ownership, disruption in implementation,
and different approaches to the supervision of project implementation. For example, because of
the frequent change of TTLs, the Bank was not focusing on data collection and M&E
implementation until late into the project. However, even with this constraint, the overall project
development objective continued to be achieved and hence the moderately satisfactory rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above, overall
Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The government's commitment to achieve the development objectives was strong at the project
concept and preparation stages. It ensured that the participatory process during project
preparation was adequate. Official commitment and ownership by the government was indicated
by: (a) an official endorsement of the project concept by the government; (b) the appointment of a




                                                15

Project Coordinator in the State Committee for Housing and Construction Policy; and (c) the
appointment of counterpart personnel at the NFHR.

Rosstroi's efforts in organizing the project selection seminar in June 1997, and the continued
support during project preparation activities after the financial crisis of 1998, indicated strong
public sector support for the sector reform agenda. Also, the willingness of the government to
assume loan repayment for the activities of the Institutional Support Services and the financing of
the CPIU indicated a keen interest by the government to include the lessons learned from this
project in the sector reform.

An inter-ministerial committee was created by the government, including representatives of the
MOF, the Ministry of Economy, Gosstroi and other federal agencies, responsible for the overall
direction and strategic oversight of the project.

The government maintained its commitment during implementation. Financial accountability and
follow-up was mostly observed; and documentation was maintained properly for periodic review.
The government officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, and
cooperated fully with the task team.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

CPIU-NFHR

Financial Management Review. Project accounts and financial reporting to the Bank, both at the
project and the entity level, was the responsibility of the NFHR. At the time of the initial
assessment, the NFHR's financial management systems, including internal controls, accounting,
and reporting were not meeting financial management requirements of the Bank. An action plan
was prepared to ensure that a Bank-compliant financial management system was in place prior to
Board presentation.

Overall, NFHR met the Bank's minimum requirements for financial management system, even
though there were a few issues. For example: (i) there were perpetual delays in project budget
approvals from the relevant Ministries. However, this issue was generic to the Russian portfolio;
(ii) activities were suspended for a couple of months in summer of 2006, while the MOF was
clearing the extension to the Agency agreement (following the project extension); (iii) there was a
delay in counterpart funding in 2007, mainly due to the period of strained relationship between
the management of NFHR and Rosstroi; and (iv) the project and NFHR audits was significantly
delayed in 2005; and provided at the last minute in 2006.

Procurement Arrangements. Procurement of all works, goods and technical services under the
project followed the Procurement Guidelines "Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits".
The NFHR had sufficient experience and adequate staffing. Prior to this project, they were
involved in implementation of the Russian Housing Project which was successfully completed in
2003. Traditional assessment of the NFHR at the project appraisal stage showed its qualification
and capacity to implement the project. The NFHR, however, could have been more proactive in
dealing with some procurement issues.




                                                 16

Reporting Arrangements. The NFHR submitted all required quarterly and annual reports in a
timely manner. These reports were informative, and provided valuable feedback on how the
project was progressing covering all project activities. The status of performance indicators were
incorporated in all progress reports and served as valuable input to Bank supervision mission
reports.

CPIU's capacity until 2004 was not adequate to assist LPMUs with the high volume of
procurement documentation work. Besides, CPIU's evaluation process was extremely slow,
which slowed the implementation and disbursement during 2003-2004.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In light of the government and NFHR performance as discussed above, the overall performance
of the Borrower was moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Important factors for the success of a project:

    · Continuity of the team working on the project, especially the TTL, is very important both
         for the Bank and the Borrower. Frequent change of TTL creates a certain lack of
         continuity    and    disruption,  and   different   approaches     to   supervision. Project
         implementation could be more effective and less disruptive, if the Bank management
         could ensure that TTLs do not change too frequently. (General applicability)

    · Strong local leadership and expertise is essential for the regional development programs
         to succeed.     Timely availability of counterpart funding is also key for ensuring the
         quality of project deliverables. Establishment of the local implementation capacity and
         arrangements for the sufficient and timely local co-financing of project activities should
         be assigned the highest priority at the preparation stage since it directly affects
         procurement and administrative efficiency during implementation. Training of the key
         staff involved in the project, not only from CPIU-NFHR, but from the participating
         municipalities and district heating companies as well, should be conducted at the very
         beginning of the project implementation.

Project Design:

    · The project design should be realistic and not overly complex, so that implementation is
         kept within the scheduled time frame. Further, in complex long-term projects containing
         the strong institutional aspects, political risks on all the levels of the government should
         be taken into account and proper mitigation risk policies should be carefully identified.
         (General applicability)

Implementation:

    · Sub Loan Agreements need to be finalized before the project is presented to the Board, so
         that project effectiveness and implementation are not delayed. In addition, sub-loan
         agreements would work better if it includes the final beneficiary ­ in the case of MHP
         project it is district heating company. When a district heating company is excluded and


                                                  17

       agreement is signed only between Ministry of Finance, Rosstroi, Oblast Administration
       and City Administration, district heating company is not able to influence the process and
       often depend on decision made by Oblast and/or City Administration (for example, in
       case of provision of financial guarantees)

Procurement:

    · The Bank should work closely with the implementing agency staff, and encourage them
       to be more proactive in dealing with delays, especially on procurement issues. Close
       cooperation between the central PIU and the heating companies/municipalities is
       important on procurement matters. (General applicability)

Monitoring & Evaluation:

    · It is important that: (i) regular progress reports such as FMRs include indicators
       explicitly linked to the development objectives of the project; and (ii) the Results
       Framework and the accompanying performance indicators are finalized well ahead of
       project implementation. Otherwise, their role in decision-making and resource allocation
       would be very limited. (General applicability)

Note: The deviations from the appraisal estimates are mostly due to cost savings (notably, the need for
contingencies did not materialize), but also due to underutilization of funds for technical assistance at the
Federal level (the "Institutional Support" component). Cost savings were often associated with alternative
technical solutions found during project implementation.

Note: The appraisal estimate for co-financing by the Borrower was based on the assumptions of higher
level of support by the Federal government to the institutional component which ended up utilizing only
$1.36m from the available $2.5m. The contributions by the Borrower towards the operating expenses of the
CPIU were also lower than planned. Finally, the Government made some savings by employing contractors
eligible for reduced taxation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Executive summary

To conduct the economic and financial analysis for this ICR, a spreadsheet model was
developed that calculates economic and financial return indicators for investments in
each of the 41 heating regions under modernization in the eight participating cities.

The calculations were based only on those project benefits (savings) that could be
expressed in terms of cash flows. For the years 2002 ­ 2007, savings were based on
actual figures from the project cities.

No environmental externalities or social effects of modernization, which undoubtedly
contribute to the project's positive results, have been taken into account.

The results obtained differ considerably by heating region and by city. Payback for
individual investments varies from almost immediate to more than 20 years, the
economic and financial internal rates of return ranging from hundreds percent down to
negative values. However, the aggregate numbers show results either approximating or
exceeding those projected in the project appraisal document (PAD).

Scope of analysis

The total number of heating regions where the heat supply systems have been modernized under
MHP amounts to 41 in 8 participating cities: 16 in Neryungri, 11 in Kazan, 5 in Mytischi, 3 in
Dubna, 2 in Tambov, 2 in Krasnoyarsk, 1 in Volgograd and 1 in Syzran.

Economic and financial return calculations have been made also for the cities in total for
Neryungri, Kazan, Mytischi, Tambov, and Krasnoyarsk.


Methodology


Capital costs


Capital costs of heat supply system reconstruction and modernization have been based on NFHR
data broken down by years of project implementation. The breakdown between the IBRD and
local financing has also been reflected.

When constructing the cash flows for capital outlays, the following approaches were taken and
assumptions made:

   · capital costs include only the investment component, consisting of equipment and
        materials costs, construction works, spare parts, mandatory training, etc.;




                                               27

    · other costs associated with the Project implementation (consulting services, Project
         management, etc.) are not included in the capital costs;
    · VAT is 20% before year 2004 and 18% from 2004 onwards;
    · customs duties are 10% with only the equipment cost taxable. If the actual share of
         equipment cost is not known, it is assumed to be 75% of the total project cost.
    · the costs for economic analysis were taken in accordance with the actual project
         financing schedule;
    · the costs financial analysis are allocated in time in accordance with the loan financing
         terms, and loan interest payments are also included.


Savings


Savings resulted from the project implementation were calculated for the following elements:

    · fuel consumption
    · electricity consumption
    · cold water consumption
    · treated water consumption
    · maintenance costs
    · repair costs
    · number of personnel
    · reduction of heat purchase
    · additional heat sales

In general, the actual savings for the years 2002-2007 were taken from the monitoring tables as
differences between "before the project" operational parameters and subsequent years' figures
including project implementation and after implementation periods.

Where the data appeared insufficiently credible or where the "without-project" rather than
"before-project" baseline was deemed appropriate, the following adjustments were made:

    · for missing data, averages of neighbouring years were taken;
    · in case of considerable reduction of heated area or population served after the project
         implementation, "before the project" figures were recalculated as for supplying the
         reduced heat loads; the comparison thus was made with the hypothetical "without"
         project scenario rather than with the "before the project" situation;
    · similarly, in case of connection of new heat loads after project implementation, additional
         heat sales were taken into account;
    · differences in maintenance and repair costs take into account actual inflation rates that
         occurred during project implementation.

Forecast of physical savings for the whole project life time is based on the figures for the last one,
or final two years of monitoring.

Economic analysis assumptions


The following main assumptions were made for undertaking the project economic analysis:
   · economic investment cost does not include VAT or customs duties;
   · a project start year corresponds with the first year of actual investments;
   · capital expenditures are distributed in time in accordance with the actual financing
        schedule;
   · a project useful lifetime is 20 years;
   · economic discount rate 12%;
   · electricity price for all the cities US$ 80/MWh;
   · cold water price for all the cities US$ 0.5/m3;
   · treated water price for all the cities US$ 1.5/m3;
   · exchange rate 25 rubles / 1 US dollar;
   · average monthly salary US$ 800;
   · economic price of the purchased heat corresponds with the economic fuel price and is
        calculated using generation and distribution efficiency of 80% and fuel cost share of 50%
        for gas and 40% for coal fired production. Economic heat prices for each city are as
        follows:

Financial analysis assumptions


The following main assumptions have been made for undertaking the project financial analysis:

   · financial capital costs are distributed throughout the project cycle in accordance with the
        loan financing terms and include local co-financing, loan repayment and interest payment
        components;
   · a project start year corresponds with the first year of actual investments;
   · a project useful lifetime is 20 years;
   · financial discount rate 12%;
   · inflation rates, fuel price escalation factors, currency exchange rates and loan interest
        rates are taken as shown in Appendix 1 to this Annex;


                                                 29

   · actual prices for energy resources, water and personnel salary for the years 2002-2007 for
       all the cities are given in Appendix 2 to this Annex;
   · for future years, all prices were calculated based on inflation rates and fuel price
       escalation factors.


Main conclusions

The results from the model differ considerably by heating region and by city. Payback varies
from almost immediate to more than 20 years, the economic and financial internal rates of return
ranging from hundreds percent down to negative values.

As additional comments to these results, the following could be noted:

   In the city of Neryungri ­ where, in aggregate, the best results were achieved ­ there are two
   distinct types of investments: a) CHS reconstruction and heat meter installation; and b) IHS
   installation and switch to 2-pipe distribution system (CHS No. 12, 10, 13, 19). The first group
   of measures with relatively low investment costs shows a very high economic return ­ mostly,
   because of reduction of heat purchased. It should be noted that these savings are likely to be
   mainly not in physical terms (actual reduction of heat consumed in Gcal) but in financial
   terms (billing based on actual metered amount of heat delivered - after the Project, compared
   to billing based on normative consumption figures - before the Project).

   The second group with relatively high specific investment costs shows much more moderate
   results ­ due, to a large extent, to the abnormally high costs of supplying and installing IHS in
   Russia. Unit cost of an IHS in Russia often exceeds $40,000 per apartment building, while it
   rarely exceeds $15,000 elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

   In the city of Kazan, the results are more similar for the heating regions considered. The
   reconstruction measures in almost all the cases include IHS installation, change for 2-pipes
   system and boiler houses modernization. An exception is the boiler house at Vishnevskogo
   2/4, where after the project implementation the boiler house stopped its operation and heat is
   delivered and purchased from another heat source. Such a big difference between EIRR and
   FIRR for this heating region can be explained by a very low heat purchase price in
   comparison with its economic value.

   For the heating region with Daurskaya 16 boiler house as a heat source, new heat consumers
   were connected after the project ­ with respective additional heat sales. Again, the difference
   between the economic and financial heat prices made the financial NPV negative.

   It also can be noted that the lower IRR were received for those heating regions where the
   specific investment costs per one building (total investments divided by the number of
   buildings where IHS were installed) are the highest. For Daurskaya, 16 it was US$ 179.4
   thousand, for Vishnevskogo 2/4 ­ US$ 91.3 thousand, for Rotornaya 9 ­ US$ 82.8 thousand,
   while the average figure for the city is US$ 60.9 thousand.

   For the city of Mytischi, all the components demonstrate positive results.

   In the city of Dubna the best relative result shows a component comprising IHS with heat
   meters installation in the area supplied from an outside heat source. The only type of savings
   generated there is a reduction of heat purchased but it is sufficient to pay back the


                                                 30

    investments. Again, as for Neryungri, these savings are probably demonstrating the
    difference between the normative and consumption based billing before and after the project.

    Negative NPVs and low IRR values for the heating region of Levoberezhnaya in Dubna can
    be explained by considerable increase of repair or maintenance costs.

    In the city of Tambov, a notable increase of operation and maintenance costs (even with the
    inflation taken into account) also could be observed for the heating region of the boiler
    houses C-01, C-04, C-27, C-03 resulting in the negative financial indicators.

    In the city of Volgograd, the reconstruction measures were also followed by reduction of the
    connected heat load that could not be fully compensated by fuel, O&M, and other savings.

    The project components in the cities of Krasnoyarsk and Syzran both show positive results.

Table 3 below allows to compare the types of investments implemented in all the participating
cities and the resulting IRRs. It can be noted that the highest return on investments comes from
the regions where there was no metering before the project but heat was purchased from an
outside heat source (Neryungri and the third component in Dubna).

Somewhat lower but still positive results can be observed for the regions where IHS were
installed in the buildings (Kazan, Mytischi, Dubna, Tambov, Krasnoyarsk). This is often
combined with the DH network rehabilitation or the boiler house reconstruction or both.

The negative results in most of the cases can be explained either by structural changes in the
heating systems operation before and after the Project (reduction of the connected heat load,
purchase of heat from an outside source instead of own boiler plant) or by considerable growth of
maintenance or repair costs (likely because of insufficient financing before the Project).

Comparison with the PAD projections

The project appraisal document (PAD) contains project cost estimates and economic and financial
indices projections for 5 cities ­ Dubna, Kostroma, Mytischi, Neryungri and Syzran. Four of them
(except Kostroma) have finally participated in the project and are considered below.

Investment program

The investment programs that were planned for the project cities at appraisal and the results of
their implementation are shown in Table 4. Economic and financial investment costs are also
presented.

* - financial costs shown do not include interest payments

As can be seen, the composition of the planned and implemented investment programs differs
substantially. The PAD and actual investment costs are relatively close for Dubna and Neryungri.
In Syzran, the actual costs are less than half those forecast in the PAD. This difference is not
surprising as the technical solutions are completely different. In Mytischi, the actual investment
costs are much higher than the planned costs ­ mostly due to bigger local contribution.

Economic and Financial Results

The project economic and financial indicators provided in the PAD and calculated on the basis of
actual project performance are given in the table below.

Obviously, the comparison is not to be taken too far since the scope of investments has changed
considerably. It should be also noted that the assumptions made in the PAD for the financial
analysis deviated from the actual reality during project implementation quite substantially. This
concerns especially the exchange rate between the ruble and the dollar, which in turn affected the
dollar prices of key inputs such as the price of natural gas:


                                  PAD
                               Forecast,     Actual,

                                  2007         2007

 Gas price, US$/1000m3                 45           66
 Exchange rate, RUR/US$             54.07           25
 Gas price, RUR/1000m3              2433          1650


Since fuel savings are a major component of return on investment in this project, the higher dollar
prices of natural gas contribute to higher IRR based on cash flows expressed in dollars.

But it can be noted that, for example, for the city of Mytischi, the results are quite close to the
appraisal forecast; for Dubna, the difference is also not as great. The implemented investment
programs in these cities are more or less in line with those projected at appraisal.

In the city of Neryungri, the investments made are close to appraisal projections, but the
economic and financial results are much better than those in the AD. The actual savings achieved
are considerably higher: 123 Tcal instead of 96 Tcal reduction of heat purchase, 6.7 GWh instead
of 0.7 GWh electricity savings, etc., while the capital costs are some 18% lower.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

At project completion, the borrower conducted a Beneficiary Survey (the Survey) which was
documented in a report entitled "Analytical Report on the Assessment of the Socio-Economic Results
of the Municipal Heating Project and the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project."

This annex contains a brief summary of the report as far as the Municipal Heating Project is
concerned.

The Survey aimed to evaluate the social effect of the project from the perspective of three groups of
stakeholders: the city/municipal administrations participating in the project; the participating heating
companies; and the end-users of their services ­ consumers of heat (final beneficiaries). Two cities
were chosen for the Survey: Dubna, a small but economically significant science-based town near
Moscow; and Kazan, a large industrial and commercial city on the Volga River. These two cities
were deemed representative of the small-size and large-size cities participating in the project,
respectively.

To achieve its objective, the Survey team interviewed the stakeholders aiming to: (i) determine the
degree of their awareness and support of the project; (ii) solicit and assess their opinion as to whether
the project was successful in meeting its stated objectives; (iii) determine their level of satisfaction
with the project results; (iv) determine the perceived value of the experience from the project for
future activities; and (v) identify and evaluate the direct and indirect social impacts from the project
and the stakeholder's perception of these impacts.

Thirty three people were interviewed, of which 17 were from the general population of heat
consumers and 16 were classified as experts. The latter group consisted of representatives of the
municipal administrations, some of which were directly involved in the project, as well as
representatives of the heating companies.

All beneficiaries confirmed the much improved quality of the heating services in the city areas
renovated under the project. At the same time, the end-users generally do not see themselves as
having any significant role in the project or in the operation of the housing and communal services
(HCS) sector in general. Part of the reason is the long-standing skepticism among the residents about
the commitment of the HCS organizations to provide quality services. For most residents, a complaint
or a plea is the most common form of communication with the HCS providers.

Among the final beneficiaries, the degree of awareness about the project per se was not very high.
Since information was not made an explicit component of the project, each city was free to choose its
own public information strategy: from a televised campaign in Dubna to a simple public notice of
service interruption appearing on one's door at the time of the construction works in Kazan.

However, awareness of the results of the project was high enough, and the degree of support of the
project by the beneficiaries was noted to be high where the apparent improvements were associated
with the project.

The final beneficiaries in both Dubna and Kazan noticed, first of all, the improved temperature
conditions in the apartments: "the radiators are always hot enough when it's cold outside". Prior to
the project, a temperature of 15oC was not uncommon in some apartments in winter in Kazan. An
expert in Kazan noted that complaints about hot water availability dropped dramatically over the last
four years. The respondents also pointed out the improved response time in emergencies.


                                                 41

On the down side, the beneficiaries were keenly aware of the increased price of heat: the tariff
increase by the heating company became particularly controversial in Kazan, where the project
company "Kazenergo" had to compete with "Tatenergo", a company supported by the Republican
(Tatarstan) Government and having the advantage of combined heat-and-power (CHP) generation
cycle on its side. With the tariff charged by "Kazenergo" being 2.5 times that of "Tatenergo", the
residents were right to question the authorities for the reasons why.

The experts note that the population generally reacts negatively to any tariff increase, but the heat
tariff increase in this case was known to be due to the Bank project's requirement to bring the cost
recovery for the population to 100%. It should be noted that this requirement often received more
attention than the fact that the overall tariff level (i.e. the average tariff for all categories of customers,
including industry and government buildings) went up 3-4 times during the life if the project. Indeed,
the controversial "Kazenergo" tariffs are not the highest among the project participants. The main
reason why they were brought into the spotlight seems to be the contrast with the low tariffs charged
by "Tatenergo" in the same city, and sometimes in the community close by.

In Dubna, the heat tariff increase was accepted with relatively little resistance. Respondents in the
Survey noted that this increase was commensurate with the increase in the level of income of the
population. In Kazan, on the other hand, the tariff level became a very controversial issue. This was
triggered by the fact that some of the communities were split between "Kazenergo" and "Tatenergo",
and the tariff charged by the latter company was about one-half of the former. Some of the difference
is attributed to the fact that "Tatenergo", as a company not participating in the project, was able to
continue the practice of cross-subsidizing the tariff for the population ­ a practice inconsistent with
the project objective of 100% cost recovery for the population.

The respondents recognized the success of the project in meeting its stated objectives as per the
indicators included in the legal agreement. Some respondents from the heating companies noted,
however, that the objectives of cost recovery did not go far enough. Focusing on operating cost
recovery, they did not provide for inclusion of the investment cost component in the tariff. Further,
the cost of the subloan debt service was treated differently by different cities, based on ad hoc
political decisions.

In Kazan, further criticism of the results of the project stems from the perceived lack of foresight
about the overall development strategy for the city's infrastructure. Over the life of the project, the
city dramatically revised its development strategy and decided to build two new heat transmission
pipelines from the "Tatenergo" plants CHP-1 and CHP-2 to the center of the city. Thus, the heat-only
"Kazenergo" plants renovated under the project and producing heat at higher costs may become
redundant. These plants were renovated in order to respond to the short-term heat supply shortages
that seemed an overriding concern at the time. The consequences of the apparent long-term planning
failure could have been more severe if not for the modular design of the "Kazenergo" boiler plants,
allowing for dismantling and moving them to a more suitable location.

According to the authors of the Survey, the level of satisfaction with the project results is closely
connected with the desire to continue the activities started under the project. In Dubna, the project
was generally deemed "useful for the city", while the respondents in Kazan appeared reluctant to see
the project continued in the future ­ due to the new scheme of heat supply for the center of the city
based on the CHPs.

The respondents close to the project had differing opinions about the value of the operational
experience gained from the project ­ particularly, in relation to procurement. The existence of a


                                                   42

double set of requirements ­ those of the World Bank and those of the Russian Federation ­ is an
obvious challenge pointed out by many experts. Interestingly, both the Bank and the Russian
procurement rules were perceived as favoring the least-cost bidder as opposed to encouraging the
highest quality-to-price ratio. Also, the Bank's rigid requirements for experience and turnover for
companies to be eligible to participate in the tenders was perceived as putting the local suppliers at a
disadvantage vis-à-vis foreign suppliers or foreign-led joint ventures and consortia.

The respondents from the heating companies have complained about the limited role they ended up
playing in the project design structure where the local PIUs were formed largely from the city
administrations or their close associates. The power to select the suitable contractors for the
construction (supply and installation) contracts was at the center of this controversy. The heating
company in Kazan, in particular, believed that the lack of possibility to participate in the decisions
about the selection of contractors was detrimental to the project.

Respondents have also noted the positive role of the Bank's technical consultants, who have
sometimes dramatically changed the city's vision for heating infrastructure development. Most
notable examples are: (i) the shift from modernization of central heating substations (CHS) to
individual heating substations (IHS); (ii) the associated shift from the traditional four-pipe secondary
network system to the two-pipe system; and (iii) the broad acceptance of the pre-insulated pipe
technology ­ including, in some cases, the establishment of the required local manufacturing base.

The value of the experience from the project for future activities was generally assessed by
respondents as high ­ particularly, in terms of creating the capacity to understand the international
practices of procurement and contractual relationships, gaining exposure to modern technology and
management techniques, including management of financial transactions. Some respondents plan to
use this experience in other project activities financed by international or Russian crediting
organizations. Interestingly, some respondents perceived their ability to reconcile conflicting
requirements of the Bank's and Russian procurement rules as a special skill that could give them an
edge in future activities. At the same time, some PIU staff felt that this newly acquired capacity might
be lost if no further Bank-financed projects materialized.

The opinions about the social impacts from the project, while varying considerably across different
stakeholders, centered on the theme of perceived commercialization of HCS services at the expense
of their traditional social role. The main premise in the assessments by various stakeholders was that
the Bank's overarching objective was to transform the municipal heating service into a viable
business rather than a public good. Experts in Dubna generally appeared to embrace the
commercialization of district heating as a positive development. In Kazan, when speaking of positive
results from the project, more credit was given to its role in ensuring that the socially significant
service such as district heating run without interruptions.

In assessing the significance of the project for the broader HCS reform, the Survey explores the
linkages between district heating and housing management that are known to have an impact on
the end user of the heating services. The ability of homeowners to organize themselves into
homeowner associations and take control of their heating bills is key to taking full advantage of
the new technology (such as individual heating substations) introduced under the project. The
Survey concludes that the project has highlighted a certain social divide that exists between the
active minority that is keen to take initiative and embrace market reform in the HCS sector and
the passive majority. The latter would rather see the minimum quality of service that requires
from them little or no participation in housing management.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

Regular stakeholder workshops were conducted under the project. They were attended by
representatives of the implementing agency (Rosstroi), the PIU (NFHR), the World Bank,
and the key stakeholders from the participating cities. During the period of 2003 ­ 2005,
such workshops were conducted at least once per year.

Such workshops were an essential vehicle for exchanging opinions and sharing
experience of the participating cities and their respective heating companies. Some
operational issues including reallocation of subloan amounts were discussed during these
workshops.

1.3.     Challenges Encountered in the Process of Project Implementation

In accordance with the Loan Agreement, the Project implementation was to start in 2002 and
terminate on June 30, 2006.

However, in 2002-2003, there was a delay (almost a year) in opening Special Account and
effectiveness of majority of Sub-loan agreements with borrowers (Participating Cities of the
Project). Disbursement of the IBRD loan funds was impossible without proper execution of the
required procedures. Actual disbursement under signed contracts for the equipment supplied,
works and services fulfilled started only in 2003.

In late May 2005, Minfin of Russia suspended financing of works under the Project, for the sub-
loan agreements included contradictions related to the payment mechanism for the up-front fee to
Minfin by the cities (as a compensation of payment by Minfin of Russia of an up-front fee to the
World Bank in amount of 1% of the loan amount). In three months, after the supplementary
agreements to sub-loan agreements were re-executed in Rosstroi and Minfin of Russia, the
disbursement of funds was resumed.

In September 2005, three months delay in Project financing was caused by discharge of Director
of the NFHR and re-execution of authorities for the NFHR Special Account replenishment in
Rosstroi and Minfin of Russia. Due to the above force-majeure circumstances in 2005,
implementation of some contracts under the Project was suspended; the time of their completion
(due to beginning of the heating season and impossibility of fulfilling works in wintertime) was
extended to 2006.


2.       Implementation of Project Development Objectives

2.1.     Assessment of the project objectives

The main objective of the Project, as defined in the Loan Agreement, is to reduce the financial
burden on the selected municipal governments related to the supply of district heating services to
the local population. This is supposed to be achieved through: (a) improvement of efficiency of
operation of district heat supply networks, (b) development of viable policy of cost recovery and
commercial practices, and (c) assistance to the government bodies in the provision of subsidies
targeted to low-income population.

These goals were considered highly important by the Russian Government at the time of project
initiation and remain so at present, although the Project has contributed significantly to the
achievement of these goals in the participant cities.

(a)      Improving efficiency of operation of district heat supply networks. This Project has
made a significant contribution to this goal in all the participant cities through investment in new


                                                 46

district heating infrastructure. A similar scope of investments could benefit most Russian cities.
However, it should be noted that the investments under the project were only enough to cover
certain portions of the participant cities' district heating systems. According to Rosstroi, total
investment requirements for modernization of the HCS sector infrastructure could take about
RUR 347 billion, or USD 12.6 billion.

(b)      Development of reasonable policy of cost recovery and commercial practices. This
project goal is still relevant, given that actual cost recovery remains relatively low in most
Russian cities ­ notwithstanding considerable increase in tariffs for services to households
(almost 4 times since year 2001 in nominal terms). Full cost recovery for housing and utilities
services has not been achieved yet. According to certain statistical data of the Ministry for
Regional Development of the Russian Federation, heat supply tariffs for population still cover
only 77.2 % of respective economic costs. The cities participating in this Project are more
advanced in this regard, with the average tariff paid by the population averaging 95% of the
overall average tariff paid by all consumers of heat.

(c)      Providing assistance to government bodies in the sphere of improvement of economic
efficiency of subsidized programs. This project goal was highly relevant at project initiation and
remains so today to a considerable extent. At the start of the Project, the subsidies to the
consumers of heat were provided through the heat tariff to the entire population of district heat
consumers. The burden of provision of the subsidy was on the municipal budget. The new system
of subsidies provided directly to low-income households is a better way to provide a subsidy. The
experience of the Project participant cities as well as many other Russian cities shows that
targeted subsidies help both the heating companies and the low-income consumers of heat and
demonstrates that it is possible to achieve better cost recovery through tariffs without significant
negative social impacts.

2.2.     Brief Description of Monitoring Indicators
The Loan Agreement 3 specifies eight monitoring indicators for the Project which can be
summarized as follows: (1) cost recovery by participating district heating companies through
district heating charges/tariffs; (2) level of cost recovery in the tariffs paid by the households; (3)
payment collection ratio to total billings; (4) rate of in-cash collections; (5) quality and energy-
efficiency of heat and hot water services; (6) operating cost reduction; (7) better targeting of
heating subsidies to low-income households; and (8) reduction of the level of support of
participating district heating companies by their municipalities.


3.       Final Borrowers' Report on Project Implementation

Sub-borrowers were sent a wide list of questions related to Project implementation outcomes.
Responses received allowed to state as follows:

3.1.     Achievement of Tasks

The Project was implemented in the conditions of a high percentage of worn-out assets in the
municipal district heating system due to inadequate funds in municipal heating companies for
repairs and rehabilitation of such systems. Participating cities were not capable of rehabilitating
worn-out facilities using its own resources due to financial difficulties and a lack of funds in the



3LA, Annex to Schedule 5: Project Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators.



                                                   47

city budget. A sharp increase in tariffs to cover costs for these purposes was not possible as it
would have resulted in an explosion of social discontent and would have become an unbearable
burden for the population due to low income of heat consumers. Interests on loans provided by
Russian banks were high and did not make it possible to repay investments in the project within a
reasonable timeframe. Attraction of direct foreign investments in such amounts leads to
ownership of facilities rehabilitated being passed to the investor, which is not acceptable in such a
strategically important sector as the heat supply sector. In addition to that, continued operation of
existing worn-out equipment and networks resulted in deterioration of the environmental situation
in the city due to excess of permissible concentration of emissions of pollutants into the
atmosphere and continued heat losses during transportation of heat to end consumers. In this
situation a decision was made to participate in the IBRD Municipal Heating Project.

Joint work of administrative city units, the operating company, the Local PIU and the Central PIU
to implement the project in each city ensured that the project was implemented in a good manner.
Continuous supervision to ensure that contractors achieve specified performance parameters at
rehabilitated facilities and provide high quality of works and independent monitoring of project
implementation by the Consultant were put in place. Tender documentation for each lot was
prepared taking into account wishes and comments of residents from the apartment buildings that
get heat from the district heating systems rehabilitated by the project.

The following conclusions may be drawn from the project: (a) Heat tariffs for the population
were increased to the level of the heat producer tariffs, thus reducing the amount of budgetary
support to the municipal heating company participating in the Project; as a result, the notion of
"tariff difference compensation" ceased to exist; (b) Federal laws were passed that replaced old-
style subsidies by targeted subsidies disbursed to personal accounts of the apartment residents.
This allowed to increase the efficiency of the subsidy program; and (iii) supporting government
efforts to improve the cost efficiency of subsidy programs through better targeting and delivery of
subsidies to low-income households.

The most important achievements of the project were: The modernization of the municipal
heating system allowed to:
             · improve its operational efficiency and reliability;
             · acquire experience in implementing projects using funds borrowed from
                 international financial institutions
             · ensure energy resource saving
             · reduce heat losses and hazardous atmospheric emissions.
             · gain experience of large scale application of advanced technologies in the district
                 heating sector

Main reasons for the success in achieving the overall objective and the tasks of the project was
the expedient resolution of all project implementation issues on the part of NFHR, the Bank, and
Borrower. Well-coordinated joint efforts allowed to achieve the set objectives.


Certain challenges, however, emerged in the course of Project implementation. The most
important achievements under the Projects, according to Sub-borrowers, are as follows: providing
consumers with high quality heating and DHW services in parallel with reduction in heat
generation and transportation costs; modernization of urban heat supply systems allowing to
improve their operational efficiency; resources savings; reduction in heat losses and level of
harmful emissions in the air; improvement of life-supporting systems reliability; experience of



                                                  48

implementing international projects with use of funds borrowed from international financial
institutions.


In general, rehabilitated facilities in the cities were put in operation according to schedules.
However, in respect of a part of facilities due dates were not met due to the following reasons:

    - Project design documentation on certain completed projects was not prepared by
       Contractors properly; remedial measures caused delays in commissioning of these projects,

    - Process of registration of municipalities' titles to commissioned rehabilitated facilities took
       significant time. This situation was aggravated by seasonal nature of works - all works
       were to be completed in summer time, when it was impossible to conduct start-up
       operations pending the heating season.

3.2.     Evaluation of Borrower's Performance

Project preparation

Evaluations of the level of RF Government's support to the Project (Project supervising
ministries and departments) at the stage of preparation and implementation by the cities were
conducted.

Certain cities believe that the level of support was rather high and rated it high or satisfactory.
According to the others, this support was rather weak. All cities noted inadmissible long delays
caused by ministries and departments in respect of various issues at the stage of Project
implementation, preparation and signing of necessary legal documents, delays in contract awards,
approvals and permits, as well as contract financing.

Project participating cities noted that should a similar project be conceived for implementation in
the Russian Federation in future, RF Government departments responsible for its preparation,
development and implementation will have to provide for considerable reduction in time for
getting approvals and execution of all required documents.

According to cities opinions, one of possible solutions might be a transfer of Borrower's
responsibilities directly to municipalities, providing for elimination of the existing administrative
barriers.

3.3.     Evaluation of Bank's Performance

Project preparation stage

According to Project participating cities, IBRD took active part in Project preparation and
implementation, providing timely support through NFHR in respect of execution of required
documents and getting necessary approvals.

IBRD conducted regular Project supervision missions including visits to Project supervising
ministries and departments, NFHR, and Project participating cities for the purposes of operational
response to all emerging organizational problems.

The cities admitted that the activities of IBRD, aimed at understanding of tasks and achievement
of consensus with RF Government were rather successful:

    - Bank's specialists supervising the Project were rather qualified and sufficiently
       experienced and skilled to provide for successful Project preparation, implementation and
       closing.

    - In the process of resources mobilization for Project co-financing, interaction of the Bank
       and RF Government was well coordinated and timely. According to Bank's requirements,


                                                 49

       the share of co-financing of the participating cities was established at the level of 20% of
       total project costs.

According to Project participating cities, should a similar project be prepared by IBRD in future,
the Bank will have to pay more attention to finance-ready municipal projects that are already
available.

Also, closer contact between IBRD and Sub-borrowers in respect of various legal and financial
issues is needed.

When developing texts, terms and conditions of contracts, it is necessary to put them in
compliance with the effective Russian law. Bidding mechanisms require adjustment in terms of
wider participation of local (regional) contractors and use of more flexible evaluation criteria for
participants qualification.

Project implementation stage

According to Project participating cities, IBRD took active part in Project implementation.

    - Bank conducted regular Project supervision missions including visits to Project supervising
       ministries and departments, NFHR, and Project participating cities and facilities in these
       cities for the purposes of operational response to all emerging problems; annual audits of
       Special Account and local Project accounts are conducted.

    - Bank's response to ongoing changes in the country have been adequate and timely. If
       needed, Project validity dates were extended, amendments made to contracts, due to
       various reasons, were reviewed and approved on a timely basis.

    - Bank's team includes highly qualified specialists with great experience and high standard
       of knowledge that were used to the benefit of Project successful implementation.
       Developed reporting formats allow for Bank's comprehensive supervision over Project
       implementation in the participating cities. IBRD's attitude towards permanently emerging
       problems in respect of Project implementation in the cities was accommodating.

    - Upon request from and with support of IBRD, municipal budgets designated funds for each
       year of Project implementation in amounts sufficient for meeting cities' co-financing
       obligations under effective contracts and loan servicing; it allowed for Project
       implementation without interruptions caused by lack of funds.

According to cities, IBRD should use more flexible criteria in the process of procurement, which
would allow for changing contract terms and conditions and sub-projects implementation
depending on specific local situation. There are unnecessary and unfeasible procedures, given the
seasonal nature of works, e.g. strictly limited timeframes for guarantee tests and issue of Final
Completion Certificates and Acceptance Certificates.


3.4.    Project Impact on Institutional Development

Project implementation has become an efficient start-up of technical upgrading and organization
of municipal heat supply administration, thus providing cities with new mechanisms of attracting
extra-budget funds for various projects implementation, modern approaches to technical
upgrading, and, most importantly, allowing to reduce burden on municipal budgets. Participating
in the Project allowed cities to accumulate rich experience of building relationships in respect of
complicated issues of investment projects implementation, modernization of assets and creating
efficient administrative and financial mechanisms for heat supply system operation.




                                                50

The most noticeable contribution in the process of institutional development was made in the
cities of Kazan, Mytischi, Neryungry, and Tambov.

    - According to participating cities, Project implementation will have long-term technical and
       economic impacts, and will provide consumers with high-quality heating and DHW
       services.

Role and impact of Federal Component, according to cities, are less significant relative to
components implemented in the cities.


3.5.     Transition to Regular Activities

According to sub-borrowers, cities' administrations and operating heating companies will not
encounter organizational difficulties after termination of Project financing from the Loan funds,
as mechanisms of borrowed funds repayment have been developed, facilities are being gradually
put in operation within the systems of municipal heating companies.

However, the lack of a program of rehabilitation of facilities not included in the Project, but
linked to the systems upgraded under the Project, may negatively affect the efficiency of
rehabilitated facilities operation and reduce future positive impacts.

Operation of all heat supply facilities constructed and rehabilitated under the Project is successful.
Complicated equipment is serviced by highly qualified personnel. It is envisaged that upgrading
of heating systems not included in rehabilitation program under the Project (boiler plants,
building-level substations, etc.) will be performed by local companies with financing from
municipal budgets and programs. For instance, the City of Kazan conducts corporatization and
merger of MUE "PO Kazenergo" with OJSC "Kazanskaya teplosetevaya kompania" (Kazan
Heating Networks Company). This will allow to level and reduce tariffs for heat, improve
mechanisms of facilities operation and maintenance, and improve the level of sector management.

Within the framework of the cities' socio-economic development programs, evaluation of
potential need in similar projects has been made; options of attracting borrowed funds (foreign
and domestic) are being reviewed.


3.6.     Key Lessons


Participation of Russian enterprises in the Project as clients, general contractors, or suppliers
encourages domestic manufacturers to expand production to meet increasing demand for goods
and services similar to the Project ones. It gives the Russian enterprises the opportunity to gain
experience of participation in international competitive bidding conducted by IFIs.

Procurement is the most time-consuming aspect of the Bank's project cycle; eventually, it
determines the length of time needed to implement the project. NFHR was aware of this issue and
addressed it as follows:

         · Early in the project, an agreement was reached with the Bank that the "Supply and
            Install" type of contract would be used for most activities under the project; this
            ensured that the contractors bear full responsibility for contract implementation, all
            the way to commissioning and testing of the installed equipment.

         · At an early stage of project preparation, with the assistance of a qualified
            international consultant (a firm), standard Terms of Reference (TOR) were developed
            for the preparation of the bidding documents for conducting international competitive



                                                 51

            bidding in accordance with the procurement guidelines of the IBRD; this resulted in a
            streamlined bidding process for the entire duration of the project.

        · It was agreed with the Cities that the bids would be made on the basis of the standard
            TORs (see above) rather than on the basis of final project design documentation for
            the investments concerned. Both NFHR and the Cities realized that the final
            documentation takes time to develop and need not hold up the procurement process.
            This has allowed to: (a) speed up the process by about 6 months per contract; (b)
            make savings for the Cities on the development of the detailed designs and associated
            agreement process involving the local permitting authorities; (c) leave the contractor
            free to choose the materials and technical solutions to meet the specifications.


B. Participating Cities

On March 27, 2001, the World Bank approved the loan provided to the Russian Federation for
financing the Municipal Heating Project indicating that funds would be allocated among 9-10
cities. Eight cities were eventually selected. Gosstroi of Russia conducted all the necessary
negotiations and procedures with the IBRD.

1. Tambov

(i). Evaluation of Borrower Performance. At the Project preparation stage and during its
implementation the degree of support from relevant ministries and agencies of the Russian
Government was significant. Issues arising during Project preparation and implementation with
regard to technical issues, resources, processing and clearance of changes, amendments to the
technical design documentation were addressed through the NFHR, which was the Central PIU
under the MHP. If a similar project is implemented in the future, ministries and agencies of the
Russian Government responsible for its implementation will need to substantially speed up the
approval of relevant documentation.

(ii). Evaluation of Bank Performance. During project preparation and implementation the IBRD
conducted supervision and provided assistance through the NFHR to ensure timeliness and
correctness of technical design documentation. In our view, activity undertaken by the IBRD
aimed to understand tasks and achieve consensus with the Russian Government was quite
successful. For successful preparation of the Municipal Heating Project, the IBRD team had
sufficient experience and knowledge. For mobilization of resources for project cofinancing
(including resources from the budget of Tambov), the interaction between the Bank and the
Russian Government was smooth and timely. If a similar project is implemented in the future, we
believe that the bidding process will need to be adjusted to allow wider participation of local
contractors.

The Bank fulfilled its obligations at the project implementation stage in a timely and smooth
fashion. The Bank responded to changes taking place in the country in time and adequately.
During project implementation the Bank conducted successful supervision of implementation and
took into account situations that arose due to events beyond control of the Borrower.

Understanding how important it was for Tambov to build a new boiler house in street block
Tambov-4 and due to an early termination of the international contact //33 with the
Closed Joint Stock Company UralKotloService, the Bank satisfied the request of the Tambov
Administration and allowed it to renew the contract with JSC Invest-Import (Serbia and



                                                 52

Montenegro), extending the contract for one year. Based on results of Bank's missions, relevant
explanations and recommendations were provided to the Borrower. During mobilization of
resources for project cofinancing (including resources from the budget of Tambov) the Bank and
the Russian Government had a smooth interaction.


(iv). Key Lessons. During implementation of the IBRD Municipal Heating Project various
mechanisms of interaction on financing issues, development of technical design and cost estimate
documentation, application of technologies in the heat generation sector and construction, in
energy savings, interaction with other entities in the housing and communal services sector in
Tambov and the Tambov Oblast were tested and put in place.

2. Neryungri

(i). Borrower Performance. At the Project preparation stage and during its implementation the
Borrower received considerable support from relevant ministries and agencies of the Russian
Government. Issues arising during Project preparation and implementation with regard to technical
issues, resources, processing and clearance of changes, amendments to the technical design
documentation were addressed through the NFHR, which was the Central PIU under the MHP.
But in preparation and implementation of similar projects ministries and agencies of the Russian
Government need to substantially simplify a number of bureaucratic procedures and reduce the
timeline for clearance of relevant documentation (this refers especially to the Ministry of
Finance).

(iii). Bank Performance. During Project preparation and implementation, the IBRD conducted
supervision, provided assistance through the NFHR to ensure timeliness and correctness of
technical design documentation processing. In our view, actions of the IBRD aimed to undrstand
tasks and achieve consensus with the Russian Government were quite successful. For successful
preparation of the Municipal Heating Project the Bank team had sufficient experience and
knowledge. If a similar project is implemented in the future, we think that the established practice
of preparation and implementation of international projects needs to be adjusted with respect to the
bidding mechanism to ensure wider participation of local (regional) contractors and use of more
qualification criteria to evaluate tender participants which will generate a much larger financial and
economic effect from projects implemented in participating cities. The Bank fulfilled its
commitments at the Project implementation stage on time. During Project implementation the
Bank conducted successful supervision of implementation, and tried to understand situations and
circumstances that arose outside control of participating cities.


(iv). Transition Arrangements. All heating facilities rehabilitated under the IBRD Municipal
Heating Project operate successfully. Sophisticated equipment is maintained by highly skilled
professionals.


(v). Key Lessons. During implementation of the IBRD Municipal Heating Project various
mechanisms of interaction on financing issues, development of technical design and cost estimate
documentation, application of advanced energy saving technologies, training regional specialists
in the area of energy saving, strengthening of metrological facilities of the regional metrology
center, improvement of interaction between all entities of the housing and communal services
sector of the Rayon under the HCS sector reforms were tested and put in place.




                                                   53

3. Krasnoyarsk

(i) Evaluation of Borrower Performance

The degree of project support by the government at the implementation stage can also be
evaluated as high, but a number of issues related to bidding, changes in contracts concluded were
not addressed quickly enough.

(ii) Evaluation of Bank Performance

       · The Bank was actively involved in project implementation, there were numerous
          missions, but the exchange of information with the aim of exchanging positive
          experience among participating cities (e.g., in the form of training workshops) was
          clearly insufficient.
       · The Bank responded adequately, which was especially clear when the Bank decided to
          extend the period of project implementation.
       · A number of indicators of project monitoring conducted by the Bank lost their
          relevance over time.
       · Cofinancing was not always provided on time. This issue should be given more priority
          in the future.
       · In the future it is extremely important to change the way the cost of the contract is
          defined. The cost of the contract should be defined on the basis of the complete set of
          the technical design and cost estimate documentation, and the preparation of the
          technical design and cost estimate documentation should be a separate project
          component. It will help avoid deviation of actual results of the contracts from planned
          results which repeatedly occurred under the existing bidding system.

(iii) Transition Arrangements
       · A lack of rehabilitation of the facilities that are adjacent to the rehabilitated district
          heating systems may reduce the future positive effect; therefore after completion of this
          project the upgrade efforts should be accelerated.
       · It is planned to continue upgrade of district heating systems in Krasnoyarsk under other
          programs.
       · Need in similar projects is being assessed.

(iv) Key Lessons. A key lesson of project implementation is experience gained in implementation
of large investments projects with participation of leading financial institutions.

4. Mytischi District

(i). Evaluation of Borrower Performance. Project Preparation: Preparation for Project
implementation was carried out with satisfactory support of the Russian Government. Gosstroi of
Russia conducted all necessary negotiations and procedures with the IBRD for the loan to be
provided. Project Implementation: On March 27, 2001, the World Bank approved the loan
provided to the Russian Federation for financing the Municipal Heating Project indicating that
funds would be allocated among 9-10 cities, including the Mytischi District.

Financing of the Municipal Heating Project was opened in 2002, but the Mytischi District did not
start project implementation until the second quarter of 2003, when a multi-sided Subloan
Agreement became effective. Despite the fact that a lot of preliminary work had been done to


                                                54

include the Mytischi District into the project and despite the fact that documents had been already
prepared we lost a year in getting clearance at the federal level (the Ministry of Finance). Before
effectiveness of the Subloan Agreement, the Ministry of Finance repeatedly raised the issue on
making a final decision as to whether provide a subloan to the Mytischi District or not.

The MOF made a requirement that an agreement on restructuring the debt of the Subborrower
Guarantor (the Government of the Moscow Oblast) in the amount of USD 1.077 million under the
Medical Equipment Project be signed. Only upon signing this agreement the Mytischi subproject
under the MHP became effective.

Despite the fact that the Subloan Agreement was not signed, starting from 2001, by requests of
the MOF, every year the budget of the Moscow Oblast and the budget of the Mytischi Oblast set
aside required funds for guarantees and subloan servicing in order to confirm the interest of the
Moscow Oblast Government in project participation. Therefore, a substantial amount of money
was actually "frozen" and guarantees of the Moscow Oblast for Oblast borrowing programs of
some direct budget funds beneficiaries could not be provided.

Rosstroi rendered active assistance in addressing all issues that arose between the MOF and the
Sub-borrower. In addition to that, during subproject implementation and during international
competitive bidding conducted to procure goods and works long delays occurred in awarding
contracts and signing documents by the evaluation committee that, in its turn, resulted in
postponement of contract implementation.

(iv) Evaluation of Bank Performance

The Bank was actively involved in Project implementation. The Bank responded adequately and
timely to changes that took place in the county and that could impact the outcome of the project.
The Bank team had sufficient experience and knowledge for successful supervision of project
implementation. Reporting forms developed allow the Bank to carry out supervision of subproject
implementation in participating cities. For the purpose of resource and time saving, the Bank has
to review the mechanism of providing loans, and provide loans directly to municipalities and
heating companies rather than to the Russian Government. Appropriate changes in procedures
will improve quality of project implementation.

(v) Contribution of the Project to Institutional Strengthening

Participation in the Project provided an opportunity to test an integrated approach to reforming
the HCS sector in the Mytischi District that includes not only upgrade of fixed assets but also
creation of an efficient administrative and financial mechanism of the district heating system
operation. Currently the Mytischi District intends to continue a large-scale rehabilitation of the
district heating system that has been initiated, and, among other things, to rehabilitate boiler
houses with the use of cogeneration and implement an innovative plasma thermal technology
that uses renewable sources of heat and electricity (solid waste incineration with generation of
electricity and heat).

5. Kazan

(i) Evaluation of Bank Performance




                                                 55

     · The Bank was actively involved in project implementation, there were many supervision
         missions, the special account and Local Project accounts are audited every year.
     · By Bank requirement, the city budget had to set aside adequate amounts for cofinancing
         and servicing of the loan every year of project implementation making it possible to
         implement the project in time and without disruptions caused by a lack of funds.

(iii) Transition Arrangements. In accordance with federal legislation, tariffs for heat are
approved by the Republican Energy Commission of the Republic of Tatarstan for each heat
supplier separately. The tariff for one Gcal of heat supplied to residential premises (district
heating and domestic hot water) is set for each apartment building separately, depending on the
heat supplier. In 2007 the Resolution of the Executive Board of the Republican Energy
Commission of the Republic of Tatarstan approved the heat tariff for MUE PO Kazenergo at the
level of 649 rubles per 1 Gcal (including the VAT). This is roughly twice the level charged by
Kazenergo only two years ago, and roughly twice the tariff charged by the Republican company
OAO Tatenergo operating in the same city. The executive committee of the Kazan Municipality
adopted measures to smooth out the drastic increase in payments made by the city residents for
heat in 2007, including social support to low-income population in the form of targeted
allowances.

One of the forthcoming tasks aimed to improve the Kazan district heating systems set out in the
Program of Social and Economic Development of Kazan for 2008-2010 is corporatization of
MUE PO Kazenergo and its merger with JSC Kazan Heat Network Company, which will make it
possible to even out the heat tariffs and improve the mechanisms to operate and maintain the
facilities.

(iii) Key Lessons. In Tender and Contract Documentation some terms and conditions of the
contract are given more importance than local legislation (Russian and Republican). In this
connection, the stage of contract completion lasts for an indefinitely long period of time. A
positive factor of project implementation is use of energy saving technologies and requirements
to materials which are rapidly introduced in the city. Starting from 2004, Kazan has organized
production of preinsulated polyurethane foamed pipes and construction of boiler houses with
modern imported equipment.
6. Volgograd

(i) Borrower's operation evaluation

     · We evaluate the Government support of the project at the stage of its implementation as
         sufficient.
     · All necessary measures to ensure a successful implementation of the project (provision of
         staff, policies, technical aspects and resources) were taken by the Gosstroi, MOF and
         MEDT and other stakeholders of the Government at a sufficient level.

(ii) Bank's operation evaluation

Project implementation

     · Bank's activities during the project implementation stage are satisfactory
     · The Bank responded to the changes that took place in the country and that could have an
         impact on the project outcomes in a rather adequate and timely manner




                                                   56

     · The Bank team has an adequate knowledge level to successfully supervise the project
         progress.
     · The Bank successfully interacted with the Government in the process of mobilization of
         the project co-financing resources (including from the participating cities budgets).
     · If a similar project is to be implemented in future, the Bank should pay more attention to
         trips of the supervision mission to the field (outside Moscow).

(iii). Transition to normal operation

     · We expect that at the initial stage the heating company may face difficulties in terms of
         qualification and practical experience of the staff in connection with operation of the new
         devices and technologies.
     · Additional training would be required for the heating company staff to move to normal
         operations and to preserve the advantages obtained during the project (including
         preserving a due level of maintenance of facilities created/built/rehabilitated under the
         project).
     · The assessment of the need in a potential proposed project was made.

(iv) Key lessons. Loans should be extended towards the projects with a complete set of design
and cost estimate documents, which will make it possible to more clearly define the procurement
plans under the entire project.

7. Syzran

(i) Achievement of Objectives. In 1995 when Kashpirskaya Mine transferred the Novokashpirsky
Town from its books to the municipality accounts, the entire infrastructure of the town was
dilapidated. Heating of the Novokasphpirsky Town of Syzran municipality was provided by the
town's boiler house fed by the steam from Syzran Heat and Power Plant of Samaraenergo Joint
Stock Company.

The steam conduit had not been overhauled for 30 years, its technical condition and insulation
being in the extremely unsatisfactory condition with major heat loss experienced at this section,
due to which Gosgortechnadzor (Technical Supervisory Agency) practically prohibited its further
operation.

The City Administration was under pressure to find an investor.· more than 10,000 meters of
piping were installed using an advanced no-chute technology. Preinsulated pipes were used to
reduce the heat loss by a significant factor. A new system for leakage monitoring is used. This
innovation will help reduce time for identification of the leakage location and its removal to save
on routine maintenance of heating pipes. The pipes differ from conventional pipes as they are
more durable due to high leak resistance of both pipes and joints.

(ii) Project's Contribution to Institutional Development Process. Huge work on replacement of
heat supply piping was completed in Novokashpirsky Town of Syzran City with the money
provided by the IBRD on affordable terms, the results will have a long term effect.

(iii) Transition to Normal Operation. · Syzran Municipality Administration is prepared to review
new proposals from the IBRD on extension of loans for the development and implementation of
the housing and communal sector projects, because there is a pressing need to get new cash flows.




                                                  57

(iv) Key Lessons. A fundamentally new type of investments for our city enabled the city to
replace the heating supply network in Novokashpirsky town within a short time, reducing
substantially the thermal loss and maintenance costs.

8. Dubna

(i) Evaluation of Borrower Performance

     ·  The degree of the project support by the Government at the project implementation stage
        was significant. The issues that arose during the implementation stage as regards
        technical aspects, resources, formalizing and approving changes and additions to the
        project documentation were resolved through NFHR.

(ii) Evaluation of Bank Performance

     ·  During the Project implementation stage the Bank was fulfilling its commitments in a
        timely and efficient manner. The Bank responded adequately and timely to changes that
        took place in the country and could impact the outcome of the project.
     ·  The Bank provided effective supervision of the Project implementation and demonstrated
        understanding of situations caused by reasons outside the Borrower's control (when
        necessary, the project timeframe was extended, and contract amendments were approved).

(iii) Transition to Regular Activity

     ·  All the facilities built and rehabilitated within the framework of the IBRD Municipal
        Heating Project are functioning successfully.
     ·  An assessment of the need for a potential follow-up project has been carried out. Options
        for attracting loan funds (foreign and domestic) are being considered and calculated.

Annex 10: Examples of Achievement of Project Development Objectives

(i) Objective 1: Improving the operating efficiency of district heating systems through
investments to save energy and reduce heat losses.

Kazan: After boiler houses were upgraded and commissioned in 2006, average gas savings
amounted to 12.05%, water savings amounted to 19.64%, heat losses decreased by 41.50%,
emissions into the atmosphere decreased by 12.05%. In addition, emissions of pollutants into the
atmosphere were also reduced.

Mytischi. The most important subproject objective achieved was the provision of quality heating
and domestic hot water services accompanied by reduction in costs to produce and transport heat.
Participation in the project provided an opportunity to test an integrated approach to reforms in
the HCS sector in the Mytischi District that included not only upgrading fixed assets, but also
creation of an efficient administrative and financial mechanism of the district heating system
operation. Natural gas consumption has decreased by 31.5%; electricity consumption has
decreased by 33%. Heat losses have decreased by half. Annual savings of costs to generate and
transmit heat amount to 63.95 million rubles. Starting from 2004, savings achieved are taken into
account in setting heat tariffs.

Tambov. Implementation of the project resulted in reduction in losses of heat, savings of natural
fuel (gas), which made it possible to significantly reduce overall energy resource quotas set for
the city and, as a consequence, reduce budget funds.

New sections of heat mains and replacement of worn-out pipelines with new pre-insulated
pipelines as well as conversion of a four-pipe system into a two-pipe system made it possible to
reduce losses in heat mains, and, as a result, to save circulation water. Installation of modern
reliable equipment at boiler houses helped reduce repairs and maintenance costs, electricity costs,
reduce labor costs.

In addition, an environmental effect was achieved, such as reduction in emissions of pollutants
into the atmosphere together with flue gases of boiler houses due to reduction in fuel
consumption at rehabilitated boiler houses, which allowed the city to improve the environmental
situation in Tambov.

       Performance Indicators of District Heating Systems after Rehabilitation

                 Indicators                    Before Rehabilitation        After Rehabilitation
Total Heat Capacity                                      51.2                         50.76

Neryungri. Some of the performance indicators of the district heating systems after rehabilitation
were the following:



                                                   61

·        Savings achieved through reduced costs to conduct capital and current repairs and
maintenance works of the CHSs, total savings: 14, 137,930 rubles per year, including:

       - savings on capital repairs: 917,700 rubles per year or 4.2 % of total savings;
       - savings on current repairs: 430,560 rubles per year or 2.0 % of total savings;
       - savings on maintenance costs: 12,789,670 rubles per year or 58.7% of total savings;

·        Savings achieved through reduced electricity consumption after CHS rehabilitation, total
savings: 1,805,900 rubles per year or 8.3 % of total savings.

·        Savings achieved through reduced consumption of heat and water for in-house needs
after CHS rehabilitation: total savings: 1,164,270 rubles per year or 5.3% of total savings.

·        Savings achieved through reduced costs related to wage and salaries paid to operations
personnel after CHS rehabilitation, total savings: 4,684,000 rubles per year or 21.5% of total
savings.

Objective 2: Promoting sound cost recovery policies and commercial practices.

Mytischi. In parallel to reduction in heat costs included in the tariff, the tariff includes costs to
repay the loan. Savings achieved during implementation of the project fully cover costs related to
repayment of the loan and payment of interest, while increase in tariffs is proportional to the
inflation rate and increase in tariffs of natural monopolies set for energy supplying companies.
The project has provided such tariff policy that allowed the municipality to repay investments in
rehabilitation without additional financial burden on the population.

Tambov. When heat tariffs are regulated for each regulation period, tariffs for the heating
company are set at the level that recovers all operating costs and heat production costs as well as
inflation related costs. Tariffs also include required profit for the heating company. The cost
recovery is more than 100%.

The cost recovery rate of the heating company in the tariff set for the residential sector is
currently 100%. The tariff for industrial and other consumers has been set above the average tariff
and is 116.7%.

Payments for heat in the residential sector are collected in cash, and payments by legal entities are
made by money transfers through banks. The heat payment collection rate is 93-95%.


Cash collected in the form of lease payments will be transferred to the city budget to a separate
account and will be accumulated in this account to repay the loan in conformity with the
amortization schedule. The entire population of the city will participate in debt repayment
through tariffs for heat services.

                                                 62

Neryungri. When tariffs are regulated for each regulation period, tariffs for the heating company
set at the level that recovers all operating costs and heat production costs as well as inflation-
related costs. Payments for heat in the residential sector are collected in cash; payments by legal
entities are made by money transfers through banks. The heat payment collection rate is 90-93%.

In order to repay the debt, in the case of Neryungri and Tambov, a mechanism for repayment of
debt was worked out and a decision was made to include the principal amount to be repaid in the
wholesale tariff of the heating company in the form of lease payments for using municipal district
heating facilities passed over to the company under lease arrangements. All town population will
participate in repayment of the debt through heat tariffs.

Dubna. Heat tariffs for the population were increased to the level of the heat producer tariffs,
thus reducing the amount of budgetary support to the municipal heating company participating in
the project.

Objective 3: Supporting government efforts to improve the cost-effectiveness of subsidy
programs through better targeting and delivery of subsidies to low-income households.

Tambov. With the aim of reducing the tariff burden on the population, the city has introduced a
system of housing allowances for low income population to pay for housing and communal
services using proceeds of the city budget. Housing allowances are targeted.

Allowances are calculated based on the maximum allowable percentage share of expenditures to
pay for housing and communal services in the total income of the family. Housing allowances are
transferred to a settlement account of residents. The threshold of expenditures to pay for housing
and communal services in the total income of the family in Tambov is 22%. The number of
families receiving housing allowances to the total number of families in the city is 4.5%.

Dubna. Federal laws were passed that replaced old-style subsidies by targeted subsidies
disbursed to personal accounts of the apartment residents. This has allowed to increase the
efficiency of the subsidy program.

Volgograd. The practice of providing the municipal subsidies for heating through heating companies is
discontinued: the housing subsidies are directly provided to the low-income households.
