MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera,
S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$20.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at
the standard variable interest rate.
Background
2.        Mexico's agricultural sector contributes about 9% of GDP, employs
about 25% of the labor force, and provides some 26% of non-oil exports.
However, rural incomes are low with 78% of rural households earning incomes
less than 30% of the national average. Because of its large share of
employment, the poverty of many rural areas, its potential for growth and
exports, and the historically important political role of the sector, the
Government considers the revitalization of agriculture to be an important
economic and social element in the structural recovery of Mexico.
3.        In the 1950 to 1965 period, agricultural GDP growth averaged 4.3%
per annum, however, beginning in the late 1960s, the costs of bringing
marginal land into production rose, and expansion of irrigated areas
diminished, slowing down growth. In the 1970s, exchange rat-e and pricing
policies discriminated against agriculture and further contributed to the
deceleration of growth. While before 1970, Mexico produced sufficient food
to feed its population and export substantial surpluses, by the end of the
1970s, it had become a major importer of basic foodstuffs. These adverse
circumstances resulted in a growth rate of agricultural GDP averaging 2.4%
per annum between 1965 and 1980, compared to overall GDP growth of around 6%
and industrial GDP growth of around 7%.
4.        In March 1980, the Government took measures to reverse the decline
of agriculture by making use of the growing revenues from oil. Higher
support prices, more input subsidies, and expansion in subsidized credit,
coinciding with favorable weather, led to substantial increase of
agricultural production of 6% in 1980 and 1981. However, with declining oil
prices, rising interest rates and debt service, and growing consumer
subsidies, these Government actions proved to be financially unsustainable.
In 1982, when farmgate prices were allowed to fall in real terms in the face
of high inflation, agricultural production declined by 1%. Beginning in 1983
and through the 1985 crop year, agricultural production recovered moderately
to an average growth of about 2.5%, primarily due to a supportive exchange
rate and favorable weather. However, in 1986, agricultural production fell
by about 4.2% due to poor weather and domestic demand contraction.
Nevertheless, because of increasing exports and declining domestic
consumption Mexico ran a substantial agricultural trade surplus in 1986
estimated at about US$1 billion, the first surplus since 1979.



- 2 -
5.        The Government continues to seek remedies to rural problems and has
turned its attention to policies and an investment strategy aimed at
increasing the efficiency of production, improving the effectiveness of
remaining subsidies and public investments, and reducing its intervention in
the market. A detailed strategy is included in the Secretariat of
Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources' (SARH) 1985-88 National Program for
Integrated Rural Development which seeks to: (a) increase farm productivity
through more efficient extension services; (b) improve the agriculture trade
balance; (c) raise incomes of the rural poor; (d) reduce and target
subsidies; and (e) provide more direct assistance to the rural sector. The
Bank endorses the above objectives and through proposed lending to the
sector, including the loan recommended in this memorandum, is supporting the
Government's strategy.
Project Obectives
6.        The Ministry of Agriculture, in collaboration with the Bank,
carried out a subsector analysis in 1984 in an attempt to better identify the
specific constraints to an efficient extension service. The analysis
identified the following constraints: inadequate training and technical
backstopping of field personnel, lack of response to farmers' needs,
inefficient organization of public extension and research services, poor
coordination among service agencies (extension, research, credit, insurance,
inputs, and marketing), and underfunding of extension services. The proposed
project would address these constraints.
7.        The overall aim of the proposed project would be to raise the
quality and cost effectiveness of extension services through the systematic
introduction of an extension methodology which includes the fundamental
features of the Training and Visit (T&V) system. The project would aim at
improving efficiency in agriculture through streamlining and strengthening
public extension services and making the system financially sustainable and
replicable. The specific objectives would be to: (a) improve the quality of
extension through improved selection, training and technical backstopping of
field staff as well as by involving farmers more directly in the design and
evaluation of extension services and research; (b) increase the number of
farmers contacted per extensionist (from 40-50 to 150-460) as well as the
crop area, and the percentage of farmers adopting new technology; (c) enhance
recovery of a growing share of extension costs from benefitting farmers, and
thus provide a fairer environment for private services to compete; (d)
improve coordination between extension, farmers, research, input supplies and
credit agencies; and (e) promote the role of women's groups in the
development process of the rural sector.
Project Description
8.        The project would comprise twenty SARH rural development districts
representative of key agroecological zones in Mexico. Specific project
components to achieve the above objectives would include: (a) training of
extension personnel (including subject matter specialists); (b) construction
and rehabilitation of limited office facilities, and procurement of vehicles
and equipment for extension and research personnel; (c) farmer training in
technical, organizational and marketing activities; (d) building up regional
farmer organizations to participate directly in the planning, evaluation and



-3-
cost sharing of extension services; (e) expanded adaptive research to improve
the quality of technical packages; (f) an improved monitoring and evaluation
system to reinforce feedback of information from farmers through extension
agents to district chiefs and researchers; (g) technical assistance to
streamline and improve SARH operations; and (h) assistance in the
establishment of women's groups for small-scale agro-industrial,
manufacturing and other community related activities.
9.        The total project cost is estimated at US$73.8 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$16.9 million (23% of total project
cost). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of Bank Group Operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively.  The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6620-ME dated May 28, 1987, is
beiag distributed separately.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
10.       Improvement of SARH's extension and research services is of
strategic importance to Government's agricultural development strategy.
Through this operation, the Bank would support the Government's efforts to
maximize the efficient use of investment resources, provide more direct
assistance to the rural sector, and improve productivity and rural incomes.
Despite the relatively low incremental cost of the project's approach to
improving SARH extension services, the pay-off in terms of incremental
agricultural output is expected to be siguificant. The project would also
support the Government's decentralization strategy by streamlining SARH's
activities and delegating more responsibility to the district and state
level. The Bank's presence would ensure that specific performance
indicators, including parameters on cost sharing, coverage ratios,
productivity, and farmers' incomes, would be closely monitored in an attempt
to measure overall extension impact, to be later replicated on a nationwide
scale. In addition, this operation complements the policy reforms being
taken by the Mexican authorities i  agriculture and the Government's
investment programs in rural development, irrigation and credit.
Agreed Actions
11.       During negotiations, the Government of Mexico agreed on the
following:
(a) SARH would implement the agreed upon institutional
strengthening program for extensirl services in all twenty
project districts;
(b)  SARH would complete the feasibility studies for the balance of
eighteen districts for Bank review and approval no later than
November 30, 1988 (eight of which by December 31, 1987);
(c) SARH would raise farmer cost sharing levels for extension
services in the irrigated northwest to 50% by June 30, 1992;



- 4 -
(d) vehicles, machinery, equipment and furniture (US$5.2 million)
would be procured under local competitive bidding procedures
in accordance with Bank guidelines. Foreign firms would be
allowed to participate. LCB is justified due to the small
size of annual procurement needs in the twenty widely
dispersed districts which does not permit meaningful ICB.
Consultants for the institutional manpower development
component would be selected in accordance with Bank
guidelines.
Benefits
12.       The project would provide the overall benefit of cost-effective,
replicable and responsive public extension services, while at the same time
through the iptplemention of cost recovery measures, it would promote an
enhanced role for private extension services. About 400,000 small-scale and
ejido farmers on about 1.8 million ha are expected to benefit from the
project. It is estimated that the percentage of farmers adopting improved
technology would increase from about 5% to 15% at present up to about 40% to
60% at full development. Typical farm family incomes are expected to
increase in real terms by over 22% by full development (year 13). The
project would have an impact over a wide range of crops and livestock
activities. Incremental production is estimated at about US$116 million per
annum at full development. In addition, the project would be expected to
generate about 11,200 new, full-time, on-farm jobs and would promote the
status of women by assisting in the development of women's groups in
agroindustrial production and community-related activities.
Risks
13.       The main risks include: (a) shortage of counterpart funds; (b)
farmer unwillingness to adopt technical recommendations; and (c) insufficient
incentives to motivate extension personnel. Remedies have been developed to
address these risks. With regard to counterpart funds, Government has
approved budget allocations for 1987 in line with appraisal estimates.
Furthermore, a major effort would be made to involve farmers in the
identification and evaluation of technical packages to be promoted under the
project. Finally, improved training and financial incentive schemes to be
promoted under the project are expected to provide sufficient incentives to
create motivated, professional extension staff.
Recommendations
14.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Banik and - commend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
