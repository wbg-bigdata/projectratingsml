(b)
the term
"Eligible  Expenditures" 
means expenditures in
respect of the reasonable cost  of goods and services required for
the Project and to be  financed  out  of  the proceeds of the Loan
allocated  from  time  to  time  to  the  Eligible  Categories  in
accordance with the provisions  of  Schedule

and
(c)
the term

of this Schedule.
 
2.
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively
for Eligible Expenditures  in  accordance  with  the provisions of
this  Schedule.
The  Borrower  shall  make  withdrawals  from the
Special Account for payments of Eligible Expenditures on the basis
of the evidence that  the  Bank  shall have reasonably determined,
and shall debit the Special Account  with the amount in dollars so
withdrawn or with the dollar equivalent of the currency other than
dollars in which the payment was  made, determined on the basis of
the rate of  exchange  between  the  dollar  and  such currency in
effect: (i) on the date each  payment shall have been made, if the
payment has taken place  within
90
days  before  the date of the
withdrawal in question has  been  requested;  or
(ii)
on the date
each withdrawal shall have been made.
 
3.
The Bank may, at  the  request  of  the Borrower, withdraw on
behalf of the Borrower from the  Loan Account and deposit into the
Special Account the Initial Deposit.
Thereafter, and on the basis
of  requests  by  the  Borrower  furnished  to  the  Bank  at such
intervals as the Bank  shall  specify,  the  Bank shall further so
withdraw from  the  Loan  Account  and  deposit  into  the Special
Account such amounts as shall be required to replenish the Special
Account for Eligible Expenditures, but only to the extent that the
amount of any such deposit,  together with any amount remaining on
deposit in the Special  Account  as  of  the date of such request,
shall not exceed, in the  aggregate, the equivalent of the Initial
Deposit.
Except  as  the  Bank  may  otherwise  agree, each such
deposit after the Initial Deposit  shall  be withdrawn by the Bank
from the Loan  Account  under  the respective Eligible Categories,
and in  the  respective  equivalent  amounts,  as  shall have been
justified by the evidence supporting  the request for such deposit
furnished pursuant to paragraph
4
of this Schedule.
 
4.
Prior to or at the time of each request by the Borrower for a
deposit by the Bank  into  the  Special  Account after the Initial
Deposit, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank in respect of each
Page  12
payment made by  the  Borrower  out  of  the Special Account, such
documents and other evidence as the Bank shall reasonably request,
showing that such payment was made for Eligible Expenditures.
 
5.
Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of   paragraph
3
of  this
Schedule, when the total unwithdrawn  amount of the Loan allocated
to the Categories,  minus  the  amount  of any outstanding special
commitment entered into by  the  Bank  pursuant to Section
5.02 of
the General Conditions, shall be  equal to the equivalent of twice
the amount of the  Initial  Deposit,  the  Bank shall be entitled,
after consultation with the Borrower,  to reduce the percentage of
disbursements for Eligible Expenditures  or  take any other action
which will ensure the Bank  that  by  the time of disbursements of
the total  amount  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan,  all deposits
(including the Initial Deposit made  by  the Bank into the Special
Account)
were made for Eligible Expenditures.
 
6.   (a)
If the Bank shall have  determined that any payment out
of the Special Account: (i) was made for any expenditure or in any
amount not eligible  for  financing  by  withdrawal  from the Loan
Account; or
(ii)
was not  justified by the documentation furnished
pursuant to paragraph
4
above,  the Bank shall notify the Borrower
of such circumstances, and if, after  a period of
30
days from the
issuance of such notice,  an  amount  equal  to the amount of such
payment or the portion  thereof  not  so eligible or justified has
not been deposited by the Borrower into the Special Account or, if
the Bank shall so request,  refunded,  to  the Bank, the Bank may,
without in  any  way  restricting  or  limiting  any other rights,
power, or remedy of  the  Bank  under  the Loan Agreement, refrain
from making further deposits into such Account.
 
(b)
If  any  amount  outstanding  in  the  Special  Account
will not  be  required  to  cover  further  payments  for Eligible
Expenditures, the Borrower  shall,  promptly  upon notice from the
Bank, and unless otherwise agreed by  the Bank, refund to the Bank
such amount then outstanding in  the Special Account for crediting
to the Loan Account and immediate cancellation.
