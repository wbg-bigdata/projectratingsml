MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Ecuador
Second Vocational Training Project (Loan 2171-EC)
Attached, for information, is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report
on Ecuador Second Vocational Training Project (Loan 2171-EC)" prepared by the Latin America and
the Canbbean Regional Office. Part II of the report was contributed by the Borrower. The report
provides an accurate assessment of project achievements.
This project exceeded its vocational skills training targets. Despite major procurement
and implementation delays, the project has had a broadly satisfactory outcome. Quality of training
has improved. However, loss of instructors to industry and recurrent funding constraints make
institutional sustainability uncertain. Follow-up action is needed to (i) upgrade facilities at the Quito
Vocational Training Center; (ii) enhance maintenance arrangements; and (iii) secure reliable funding
for vocational training.
The project will be audited together with its predecessor (Education II, Loan 1157-
EC).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR
SECOND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 2171-EC)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second Vocational
Training Project in Ecuador, for which Loan 2171-EC in the amount of US$16
million equivalent was approved on June 3, 1982 and became effective on April
22, 1983. The loan amount disbursed was US$15,827,510.48 and an amount of
US$172,489.52 was canceled. The original closing date was set for December
31, 1986 but after four extensions, was finally set for December 31, 1990.
The final disbursement of the loan took place on June 4, 1991.
This PCR was prepared by the Human Resources Operations Division,
Country Department IV in the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office
(Parts I and III) following a mission to Ecuador between November 5 to 9, 1990
and the Borrower (Part II). Preparation of the report was based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report, the record of the Board diacussion of this
project, the Loan Agreement, all material in the Bank files pertinent to this
report and the findings of the mission.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECUADOR
SECOND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 2171-EC)
EVALUATION SUMHARY
Introduction
1.        Identification of the Second Vocational Training Project was
carried out by a Bank mission in November 1980; the project was appraised in
June 1981, approved by the Board in June 1982 and the loan became effective in
April 1983. The project's total cost was estimated to be US$33.4 million,
including US$16.0 million from the Bank loan and US$17.4 million from the
Government of Ecuador.
Oblectives and Content of the Prolect
2.        The Second Vocational Training Project l/aimed to support the
Government in the promotion of vocational skills training within the 1980-84
Economic Development Plan. Its main objectives included expanding training
capacity for skilled workers, increasing equity by a wider regional
distribution of training opportunities, and improving training quality and
management capacity in planning, supervision and evaluation. The Servicio
Ecuatoriano de Capacitaci6n Profesional (SECAP) was responsible for
implementing the project.
3.        At appraisal the project was expected to be completed in four years
and comprised: (a) construction, furnishing and equipping of ten vocational
training centers, one instructor training center and one instructional
materials center; (b) expansion and additional furnishing and equipping of two
vocational training centers and additional equipping of one vocational
training center; (c) five mobile units; and (d) technical assistance to
strengthen the SECAP management.
Implementation: Experience and Results
4.        Implementation of the project was subjected to various constraints
resulting in time overruns and change of project content and size. Completion
took eight and a half years or 112% (four and a half years) beyond the
appraisal estimate. Delays amounting to about 45 months were due to:
(a) overextension of SECAP's implementing capacity during the first nine
1/   The first Vocational Project was approved in May 1975 for the equivalent
of US$4 million. Implementation of the first project was satisfactory,
contributing to the expansion of SECAP's Vocational Training Program to
meet specific manpower requirements in priority sectors of the economy.
That project was closed 1983.



- iv -
months; (b) uneven availability of counterpart funds; and (c) slow start to
equipment procurement. Resulting from the delay, two vocational training
centers were canceled, two mobile training units were added and adjustments
made to the technical assistance component.
5.        The project is meeting most of the objectives established at
appraisal. The eight new vocational training centers produced an output of
20,078 employed workers in 1989 (appraisal estimate, 15,200), more equitably
distributed around the country. At the time of completion the mobile units
were not operating due to lack of operational funds and delay in obtaining
operational agreements with the Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Some 2,335
instructors were trained since 1984 (appraisal estimate, 1,630). However,
many qualified instructors are lost to industry due to SECAP's low salaries,
so quality of instruction in many cases remains low. Linkage with local
industries is on an ad hoc basis. However, SECAP has good relations with many
industrialists, further strengthened by the in-plant training program, which
accounts for 302 of SECAP's activities. The industrialists are favorable
regarding quality and relevance of courses. Curriculum is based on
occupational analysis. The production of teaching materials is under way at
the new Instructional Materials Center. The products are now being sold to
recover costs. Technical assistance was provided to strengthen SECAP's
management system and the institutional weaknesses identified at appraisal
have finally been overcome. In December 1989 the Planning Department did a
survey to determine training needs. The results were incorporated into the
Annual Training Plan.
Sustainabilitv
6.        One or two vocational training centers located in remote areas may
be difficult to sustain due to limited demand and may have to adjust their
focus to the training of unemployed out-of-school youth. The funding of
operating costs is a recurrent problem. To increase resources, SECAP
management is proposing a reform to the law increasing the wage levy from 0.5%
to 22. This is meeting stiff opposition from industrialists and there is
little hope of the Government's increasing its contribution. In view of this,
SECAP should change its approach and start charging for services rendered
through contracts with firms or directly from fees paid by traineesY
Findings and Lessons
7.        The appraisal team paid insufficient attention to the Bank's
experience in the first two education projects relating to: (a) provision of
counterpart funds during the construction period; (b) availability of
operating funds after completion of construction; and (c) project management
weaknesses. Furthermore, the project was declared effective before the Bank's
first vocational training project was finished. Due to resource constraints,
Quito center, one of the first project's components is not fully operational
2/   SECAP's component of the First Social Development Project (Education and
Training), approved by the Board on December 17, 1991, includes
provisions to establish fees for technical assistance and training for
small manufacturing business as well as to increase SECAP's collection
of fees for all its training courses.

seven years after completion. The Bank should therefore intervene early in
the project cycle, preferably before the date of effectiveness, and include
measures such as performance and funding targets and dates that can provide
leverage to ensure adequate funding for proper completion. In situations
analogous to the series of SECAP projects, negotiations should assure that
follow-on projects will be adequately funded and will not starve on-going
projects of resources for implementation.
8.        The project made no provision for maintenance of facilities and
equipment. Future projects should systematically include a maintenance
component.

B.   Background
1.01      Subsector Context.  At the time of project generation, the
Ecuadoran planning body, Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo (CONADE), had prepared
plans for the development of the human resources required for attaining
expected economic rates of growth. These requirements were based upon the
population census of 1974. They were projected on the basis of labor force
growth estimates, actual economic growth through 1980 and a planned growth
rate of about 6Z during the period of 1981 through 1985 (see Annex 1). As a
result of this analysis trained workers emerged as a key issue.
1.02      Linkages Between Proiect. Sector and Macro Policy Obiectives.
Reflecting this situation, the Government assigned high priority to vocational
skills training within the 1980-84 economic development plan and allocated the
major responsibility for fulfilling training needs of semi-skilled and skilled
worker by sector and area to the Servicio Ecuatoriano de Capacitaci6n
Profesional (SECAP). Therefore, the project was justified on the ground that
it would assist SECAP in implementing the Government's Plan.
1.03      SECAP's Role.  SECAP was established in 1968 and administered as a
semi-autonomous agency.  At the time of project generation there was an urgent
need for skills training programs of various types, skills requirements were
rising steadily, and the output from SECAP was insufficient to meet projected
demand due to insufficient training opportunities. Estimated total outputs of
all existing institutions in 1979/80 were only about 2,000 newly skilled
industrial workers as contrasted to an average annual demand of about 18,000.



- 2-
C.   Proiect Oblectives and Description
1.04      Proiect Oblectives.  The project addressed major issues of SECAP's
vocational training programs by:
(a) increasing training capacity for skilled workers to produce an
output of about 2,800 new skilled workers and upgrade the skills of
about 13,400 employed workers;
(b) improving the quality of training through: (i) the provision of
new equipment for 2,000 students in existing centers;
(ii) improving and expanding instructor training; and (iii) the
production of instructional materials;
(c) providing more equity in training opportunities through a wider
regional distribution of training centers and mobile training
units; and
(d) improving the management capacity of SECAP in the areas of
planning, supervision and evaluation processes.
1.05      Proiect Components.  As originally planned, the project comprised
construction, furnishing and equipping of the institutions as outlined in the
following table:

D.    Proiect Design and Organization
1.06        Based on the experience of the first Bank-financed project in
technical and vocational education in Ecuador, the conceptual foundation for
the project was clear. It aimed at improving SECAP's vocational training
programs by increasing training capacity, management efficiency and expanding
regional activities. However, the project proved to be too large in light of
the limited absorptive capacity of SECAP's administration, and for the need
for training in some regions. Moreover, the project design approach, while
consisting both institution-building and infrastructure components, caused



SECAP to focus mainly on the construction aspects. This resulted in slow
start-up of the project, delay in the institutional, training and
instructional materials programs, with consequent extension of completion
dates.
1.07        The bulk of the project resources was devoted to building and
equipping a network of training facilities. However, maintenance of
facilities and equipment was not included in the project.
1.08        In addition to its usual administrative and managerial functions,
SECAP had responsibility for the implementation of the project. The project
was administratively and financially more complex than originally expected and
too large for SECAP to implement within four years.
E.    Project Implementation
1.09        Critical Variances in Prolect Implementation.  Main gaps between
planned and actual project implementation appear in the elapsed time required
for project closing, and project content revisions.
(a)   Elapsed Time.  Comparing the planned and actual implementation
schedule shows that the project required eight and a half years to
complete from the date of loan signature, four and a half years
behind that estimated at appraisal. The causes of delays can be
broken down as follows:
(i)   about nine months during the initial stage of project
implementation because of: a) over-extension of SECAP's
implementing capacity; b) involvement of SECAP's Board of
Directors in day-to-day operations; and c) turnover or lack
of experienced technical staff;
(ii)  about 30 months because of uneven availability of
counterpart funds, particularly in the period 1983-86; and
(iii) about six months due to slow start in procurement of
equipment exacerbated by the need to adjust the equipment
lists to accommodate a donation of electrical/electronic
equipment given by Canada. This was compounded by
burdensome procedures for the approval of bidding documents
and contracts.
(b)   Project Content.  The major revisions in project content were the
following:
(iv)  reduction of the number of vocational training centers from
15 to 12 by January 1987 and June 1989 amendments (see
Annex 2);
(v)   addition (to the 5 mobile training units planned at
appraisal) of 11 new mobile training units by January 1987
amendment. These additional mobile units were reduced to
two by an aide-memoire which was signed in June 1989,
thereby reducing to 7 the total number of mobile training
units financed by the project; and



(vi) increasing technical assist'ance to include 432 man-months of
local consultants and 232 man-months of specialists from
abroad.
1.10        Project Risks.  Although the assessment at appraisal highlighted
weakness in management and shortage of counterpart funds, these risks were
still underestimated in magnitude.
1.11        Unforeseen Factors Affecting Prolect Implementation.  Other
constraints to project implementation included frequent turnover of SECAP's
top-level management, slackening of public sector activities in the
presidential election period (1986/87), rapidly rising inflation, and
financing difficulties regarding operating costs for SECAP's expanded training
facilities.
F.    Maior Results of the Project
1.12        Prolect Oblectives.  The major weaknesses identified in the SECAP
training system have been addressed through the project by the qualitative
improvements, increased output and better regional distribution of services.
1.13        Impact of the Proiect.  Most of the physical targets of the
project were substantially achieved except for the Commercial Training Center
in Guayaquil, where, although construction is 90% complete, there is no
provision for equipment. The remaining vocational training centers are
distributed throughout the country with one or more centers in each of SECAP's
geographical regions, thus bringing training opportunities to many more young
people. Courses have started for apprentices, unemployed out-of-school youth
and employed workers in 12 trades. Overall output from the project centers
was 20,078 in 1989 (appraisal estimate, 15,200) (Annex 3). The greatest
numerical increase was in the Northern Region dominated by Quito, followed by
the Central Region. Technical assistance was received to help with the
organization and supervision of centers and preparing equipment inventories.
The mobile units were just received at the end of the project, therefore,
there was no output from that component. Agreement has now been reached with
industrialists for assistance in utilizing the mobil units. Of the rest of
the equipment supplied, 70% has been installed but only about 15% is in use.
Low utilization is due to: (a) shortage of consumable materials; (b) shortage
of instructors; and (c) inadequate electrical installation at the Materials
Production Center/Graphic Arts in Quito and at the vocational training centers
at Quito, Cerfin, Riobamba and Loja (transformer too small). SECAP has
included funds in its 1992 budget to rectify the installation problems.
1.14        In a drive to improve the quality of instruction and provide
teaching personnel for the new centers, an instructor training center was
built. Since 1984 a total of 2,335 instructors were either trained or
upgraded (appraisal estimate, 1,630). However, with wages for comparable
personnel in industry at least twice an instructor's wage, there is a major
retention problem, and those instructors who remain tend to be less competent.
Technical assistance in training methodology was received to upgrade personnel
in the instructor training unit. In spite of this and bilateral technical
assistance, the quality of instruction, although considered reasonable by
employers (para. 1.16), could be considerably better in many of the programs.



- 5 -
1.15        Linkage with local industries is on an ad hoc and personal basis.
Each regional office of SECAP, which has responsibility for the training
centers in the region, is supposed to have established tripartite advisory
committees to coordinate with the local productive sectors in determining
training needs, program planning and course organization. Some committees
were created, then failed for a variety of reasons. There is thus no
established means for official consultation at regional level. Nevertheless,
the informal arrangements seem to work reasonably well. SECAP has established
good working relationships with the training units of the industrialists'
associations. This is further strengthened by the in-plant training program
which accounts for 30% of SECAP's activities.
1.16        Comments from business and industry are generally favorable
regarding the quality of the trainees and the relevance of the courses (70%
positive). Curriculum is based on occupational analysis and developed by
subject matter specialists. In some cases assistance has been supplied by
international experts. The production of teaching materials and course guides
is now under way in the new Instructional Materials Center in Quito. To
recover operating costs, the products are now being sold at a nominal charge.
1.17        The management and administration of vocational training at the
national level has been greatly strengthened. A methodology for planning,
organizing and evaluating is now in operation, and a costing system designed
to identify unit costs is about to be established. Technical assistance was
provided and, overall, the institutional weaknesses identified at appraisal
have been overcome.
1.18        In December 1989, the Planning Department carried out a study
financed by the project to determine demand for skilled workers and
technicians by industry, occupation and geographical area. The work was done
efficiently and the results incorporated into the Annual Training Plan.
G.   Proiect Sustainabilitv
1.19        One or two vocational training centers in remote areas (e.g., Loja
and Manta) may be difficult to sustain as originally designed. In the case of
Loja, the above-mentioned study showed an overall demand for upgrading of 376
workers in the industrial sector and 210 workers in commerce. Apprentice
training is, therefore, not justified. Furthermore, the specialties
established in the Center do not correspond with demand. Some adjustment of
specialties may be required with the Center more appropriately focussing on
the training of unemployed out-of-school youth.21
1.20        The funding of operating costs has been a recurrent problem with
education projects in Ecuador. SECAP is no exception. SECAP derives its
operating funds from the 0.5% wage levy paid by public and private employers
in the industrial, commercial and services sectors. According to the law
establishing SECAP, the Government undertakes to assign an amount in the
3/    SECAP's component of the First Social Development Project (Education and
Training), approved by the Board on December 17, 1991, includes several
studies to conduct occupational analysis in response to changing labor
market demands.

General Budget of the State at least equal to the contribution of the private
sector for the previous year. This has never occurred (Annex 5). SECAP
management is now proposing a reform to the law increasing the wage levy to
2%. This is meeting stiff opposition from the employers, and based on
previous experience there is little hope of the Government's increasing its
contribution. It would seem opportune, therefore, for SECAP to change its
approach and to start charging for its services, recovering its costs directly
from the consumer through contracts with involved firms or groups of firms or
directly from fees paid by trainees. Also critical to the successful
operation of the project training centers is the retention of sufficient
numbers of good instructors receiving salaries at a competitive level with
industry. Sustainability of the whole operation, therefore, depends on
SECAP's success in securing an adequate flow of funds into its operating
account.
H.    Bank Performance
1.21        Maior Strengths and Weaknesses.  The Bank required just over one
year and 4 missions for developing the project. Bank assistance during
project development was key to timely project preparation and loan processing.
The Bank's past experience with SECAP's first project also greatly contributed
to project concept and design. However, the project appraisal was overly
optimistic regarding the Government's ability to contribute counterpart funds
in a timely way for implementing the project, and the implementation capacity
of SECAP was overestimated.
1.22        In the 8.7 year disbursement period, the Bank fielded 18
supervision missions representing 57.5 staff-weeks of effort which is
reasonable for this type of project in the LAC Region. The frequency of the
missions was satisfactory (at least two per year except for 1983 and 1987).
However, the staffing of those missions may have been inadequate because nine
of them (50%) only had one staff member. This seems low given the complexity
of the project, particularly its institutional environment. In addition,
during implementation the turnover in Bank staff assigned to the project was
considerable (with 11 staff members, including 3 project managers,
participating in supervision missions). This lack of continuity made
supervision less effective as the focus on main problems could have been lost,
e.g., implementation capacity continued to be overestimated and a strong case
for using technical assistance for institutional strengthening was made only
in the 1989 loan amendment. Since the borrower's executing capabilities were
weak, as acknowledged at project appraisal, there was a clear need for the
Bank to maintain greater continuity of its personnel with a view toward
assisting SECAP strengthen its own supervision and monitoring capability.
1.23        Two major positive features in Bank performance were the
flexibility it adopted in accepting project changes and the constructive
dialogue and rapport between Bank staff and the executing agency. These
advantages have yielded several institutional benefits to SECAP, particularly
regarding the technical assistance components (specialist, fellowships and
studies) which were substantially increased (see paras 1.09 and 1.29 and
Annex 2).
1.24        Lessons Learned.  The following lessons for design, organization
and implementation may be drawn:



- 7 -
(a)   The borrower's capability to provide counterpart funds and
management should be assessed carefully at appraisal. The
experience in this project shows that while the appraisal
assessment had indicated the risks of shortage of counterpart
funds and weakness in management, these risks were underestimated
in magnitude. Also, this project was declared effective before
the facilities included in the First Vocational Training Project
(Loan 1157-EC) had been commissioned. This contributed to in
SECAP's budgetary overextension and part of the first project was
not completed. For example, Quito Vocational Training Center
required a larger transformer to operate its machinery. As a
result of limited funds, seven years later, there is still not a
large transformer and some of the high power machinery cannot be
used when the center is working at more than half of its capacity.
Where a second phase project is to be implemented, the Bank must
ensure that proceeding with a second project does not negatively
affect an earlier investment.
(b)   The Bank should act with flexibility during implementation to
allow for an increased Bank disbursement ratio and for changes in
the allocation of loan proceeds. The experience in this project
underscores that these measures can help avoid interruption of
project implementation due to limited counterpart funds.
(c)   Poor maintenance is a problem in most of the project facilities.
Therefore, the financing of facility and equipment maintenance and
the strengthening of maintenance capacity should systematically be
considered in Bank-financed projects with facilities construction.
(d)   Whenever a major change is made in the local organization
responsible for project coordination, Bank supervisory staff
should provide rigorous training to the new PIU.
I.    Borrower Performance
1.25        Major Strengths and Weaknesses.  Overall performance with regard
to both project preparation and implementation by SECAP was acceptable.
Original architectural designs, which were prepared by local consulting firms
under supervision of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff, were
generally sound. During implementation some construction plans required time-
consuming corrections but these were adequately done under the supervision of
the PIU's architect. The specification of much of the early equipment
packages required considerable revision, and additional time, before being
successfully tendered. A better use of SECAP's equipment administration
controls would have helped to avoid the slow installation and delays. The
technical assistance component was implemented efficiently and effectively.
Nevertheless, less than 32Z of the staff-months available were used as
significant bilateral funds were mobilized to finance technical assistance
(see para 1.29).
1.26        The major shortcomings in borrower performance were of a
financial, political and managerial nature. The borrower had serious
financial difficulties in meeting its counterpart funding obligations, a major
reason for reducing the size of the project and for the numerous extensions of
the closing date. During the first four years of implementation, there was a



high rotation of SECAP's directors which reduced SECAP's policy-making
capacity and administrative continuity of key project staff. Finally, the
borrower did not fully comply with the key loan covenant of preparing and
implementing a training plan until 1989/90 which adversely affected centers'
enrollments.
1.27        Lessons Learned.  The major lesson learned by SECAP was that
successful performance requires administrative continuity at the project
level, as well as a strong PIU fully committed to the job.
J.    Proiect Relationships
1.28        Bank relations with Government and SECAP on the project have been
good. SECAP was successful in maintaining an adequate relationship with other
government departments; the completion of this project, despite the delays, is
the result of the productive working relationship between SECAP and the
Ministry of Finance and Public Credit.
K.    ConsultinR Services
1.29        Role. Performance Level and Implications of Involvement.  The
upgrading of the organization and management system of SECAP could not have
been effected without the consultant inputs which were received during the
project (Part III, table A, Direct Benefits). While only about 32% of the
staff-months provided were used, extensive technical assistance was also
provided from bilateral sources for supervisor training, printing and
occupational analysis. The technical assistance inputs were highly rated and
the advice absorbed into SECAP's system. However, in spite of the appointment
of a coordinator, the program established at appraisal was too large for SECAP
to manage, resulting in underutilization of the resources and delay.
L.    Project Documentation and Data
1.30        Adequacy of Staff Appraisal Report and Working Papers.  The
Appraisal Report was somewhat imprecise on project content; it was difficult
to determine exactly the mix of new construction and expansion intended at
appraisal in respect to vocational training centers; furthermore, while no
mention was made of a headquarters unit for SECAP, a complex was built which
housed the Instructors Training Center, Materials Production Center, including
graphic arts, and headquarters offices for SECAP.
1.31        Changes in the number of mobile units and the quantity of
technical assistance were registered in missions' aide-memoires, but were not
reflected in amendment to the Loan Agreement.

PART II:   PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(Prepared by Borrower)4
2.01        The processing of the Second Vocational Training Project, in terms
of its identification and subsequent approval, took exactly one year (June
1981-June 1982). The loan becoming effective in April 1983. Its initial cost
was US$ 16 million, with Banco de Desarrollo del Ecuador (BEDE) providing
counterpart funds in the amount of S/ 1,130 million.
2.02        The BEDE Loan Agreement was signed on January 9, 1986, but BEDE's
first disbursement did not take place until October 31, 1986.
2.03        The World Bank made its final disbursement on December 31, 1990,
after four extensions of the Closing Date and following substantial changes in
the percent of expenditures financed by the Bank.
2.04        The project itself took eight years to complete, during which time
both its content and size underwent a series of changes, delays and
reorganizations, which were dealt with efficiently both by the World Bank
missions and through the invaluable assistance provided by the Bank's staff at
all levels.
2.05        The World Bank furnished essential support in formulation of the
final project, which was geared mainly to vocational training within the
framework of the country's Economic Development Plan, its chief objectives
including the training of skilled workers and improvements in training quality
and administrative capability in the areas of planning, supervision and
evaluation.
2.06        The Bank's flexibility, evident throughout the entire project
period, was affected by the delayed availability of local counterpart funding,
a situation further aggravated by BEDE's tardiness in releasing funds for
infrastructure project cofinancing under its Loan No. 322-BEDE-SECAP.
2.07        It is also pointed out that the project was implemented almost in
its entirety since, except for the decision not to build two centers for lack
of funding, all the other components were completed.
2.08        Because of excessive red tape at the local institutions, bidding
competitions 01-85-SECAP-BIRF and 01-89-BIRF-SECAP suffered severe delays at
the stages of invitation to tender, list preparation and the corresponding
approvals. Physical and electrical contingencies also had to be handled once
data were available on the size of the equipment, its electrical capacity, and
all other elements, including furniture, necessary to its operation.S'
4/    PART II of the report was prepared by SECAP and received by the Bank on
August 26, 1991.
5/    The Spanish text is somewhat vague at this point.



- 10 -
2.09        These lessons were put into practice in bidding competition 01-89-
BIRF-SECAP, since, in contrast to the first competition, which took five years
to set up the equipment, the equipment awarded at the second one took only one
year to set up.
2.10        Because of the turnover or shortage of staff at the PIU, the
processes of invitation to tender for both civil engineering and equipment
were delayed, resulting in situations where desperate attempts were made to
refinance the Bank's share vis-a-vis BEDE, since incoming managers and staff
found themselves faced with lapsed construction budgets.
2.11        Inconsistencies between the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement and
Ecuadoran legislation (Ley de Licitaciones y Concurso de Ofertas) caused
activities to be delayed more than once. Through the efforts of supervision
missions, country implementation reviews and agreements with key authorities,
all projects in Ecuador now include specific provisions that the Bank's
Guidelines prevail.
2.12        In 1988, the PIU was subdivided into two departments; one
eminently technical, the Projects Department, and the other the Financial
Department, which assumed direct management of the funds from BEDE and IBRD.
This relieved pressure at project management level since each Department was
run along rational lines and there was effective coordination between the two.
These changes, known and approved by the Bank, finally gave the project the
boost it needed.
2.13        For the Bank's part, there was complete autonomy of project
management, and the Bank showed itself to be eminently flexible. The
supervision missions were absolutely vital to the project's success at the
implementation stage, and will serve in future to correct errors and clarify
relationships between the parties. The Bank could always be relied upon,
regardless of the channel through which it was contacted, to provide
fundamental support in the handling of problems and anxieties.
2.14        Parts I and III of the PCR cover the project's objectives and
achievements as of the date of their preparation incorporating all pertinent
statistics, criticisms and recommendations. SECAP now has a picture of the
project results, as well as an idea of the actions and reactions that may be
expected to form part of the new project under preparation.
2.15        SECAP has taken in all these details and is currently waging a
nationwide campaign to correct the underutilization of its plant, arrange
instructor training courses, redistribute equipment and establish satisfactory
plant maintenance, and to inform the public of the services it offers in the
area of skilled labor and mid-level management training.
2.16        It must be realized that SECAP is not a political body but an
eminently technical institution, working in our country's highest interests to
help us meet the challenges before us, such as the opening up of frontiers
among the Andean Pact countries and the consequent need for highly skilled and
competitive labor.
2.17        Thanks to the experience gained during project implementation,
particularly during the period 1987-1991, SECAP considerably improved its
organization, technical skills, financial management and administrative



- 11 -
procedures, as well as enhancing its capabilities in the area of external loan
management, based essentially on the Vocational Training System. This has
been recognized by the World Bank and by other public sector agencies
operating externally financed project accounts, which have even asked SECAP
for assistance in this area.
2.18        Emphasis should also be placed on the strong assistance provided
by the Subsecretaria de Credito Publico of the Ministry of Finance, which
SECAP was able to rely on at critical moments and which was instrumental in
leading the project to a successful outcome.
2.19        The work of the Institution in executing the Technical Assistance
component gained momentum with UNDP Agreement ECU/89/RO1, since most of the
consultant inputs consisted of positive and useful recommendations, which
SECAP was able to 4.mplement and which have led to satisfactory conclusions and
results, with particular relevance for the new project that IBRD is to finance
for Ecuador's social sector, as represented by the Ministries of Education,
Labor, Social Welfare and Health.
2.20        With respect to the above-mentioned UNDP Agreement, the excess of
red tape affected the flow of disbursement whenever procurement or procedures
connected with the fellowships or administrative processes are involved, since
the office in Ecuador has to go exclusively through the OPS in New York. It
should be clearly stated that project commitments will be fulfilled rapidly,
without the need for too many authorizations, since these tend to hold up the
smooth flow of disbursements that is essential to the successful progress of
any project.
2.21        Finally, it is up to SECAP to avail itself to the fullest of the
results achieved to date, and to hold itself responsible vis-a-vis the
Government and people of Ecuador for compliance with the project goals and
objectives.

Comments on Proiect Timetable
3.01        Project formulation took a shorter time (13 months) than the
average education project (27 months). Since project identification stemmed
from the supervision of the previous project (Ln. 1157-EC) reasonable sectoral
information was available. Therefore, less preparation work was required
before appraisal.
3.02        Completion of the project took about four and a half years longer
than envisaged. This delay was due in part to unavailability of counterpart
funds and in part to management problems. During the period 1982/83, there
were no disbursements; disbursement was only 6% per year in 1984 and 1985.
The resources and technical capability of SECAP to manage the project were
overestimated during appraisal.

Comments on Loan Disbursements
3.03        The funds made available under the loan were disbursed at a much
slower rate than foreseen at appraisal due mainly to (a) a slow start (actual
accumulated disbursement for the planned six years 1982-87 amounts only to 21Z
of appraisal estimates); and (b) frequent turnover of SECAP's top-level
management during the first four years of implementation.

Comments on Proiect Implementation
3.04        Before loan effectiveness most sites were selected.  Therefore
site acquisition was not one of the delaying factors in project
implementation. However, construction of a center in Esmeraldas was canceled
from the project because of the lack of an available site.



- 14 -
3.05        Implementation of the construction of the centers run into
numerous difficulties largely because SECAP's personnel did not have enough
experience in educational facilities of this type. This situation was
especially significant with regard to the center in Manta where corrections on
originally architectural plans were necessary. The quality of construction
ranges from fair to good.
3.06        Procurement of equipment was carried out through ICB in accordance
with Bank guidelines. In general equipment is satisfactory in quantity and
quality. However, SECAP's deficient control for equipment installation
resulted in slow installation and delays.

Comments on Project Costs and Financing
3.07        Difficulties in obtaining counterpart funds are reflected in the
five times that the proceeds of the loan were reallocated. In December of
1983 the first change affecting disbursements was made by permitting
withdrawals from the special account for civil works. In January of 1987 the
disbursement rate for civil works was reduced from 50Z to 24% to help SECAP
increase the number of mobile units. In January and December of 1988 and July
of 1989 the disbursement percentage for civil works was increased from 24% to
43%, 56% and 70%, respectively. Despite this effort by the Bank to facilitate
the use of the loan proceeds, the borrower continued to act slowly in the
process of implementation.

Comments on Direct Benefits
3.08               Output goals from the vocational training centers have been more
than met. Due to delays in the acquisition and operation of the mobile units
there is no output from this component. There are also problems in respect to
instructor retention and quality, availability of operational funds and in
some cases low demand for courses which may be due to lack of outreach.

Commnents on Missions
3.09        The frequency of the missions was satisfactory (at least one per
year). However, the staffing of those missions may have been inadequate
because nine of them (502) did not have more than one staff member. This
seems low given the complexity of the project.
