I. MAJOR ISSUES IN SKILL TRAINING
Overview
1.01      The major issues in skills training in Ecuador are the shortage and
low quality of skilled workers. These problems have adverse consequences on
industrial productivity and will become progressively more serious if not
adequately addressed.
Skill Shortages
1.02      There is an urgent need for skills training programs of various
types, skills requirements are rising steadily, and the current output is
insufficient to meet projected demands due to insufficient training
opportunities.
1.03      Need for Skills.  In efforts to reestablish the high average annual
rates (8.3% at constant 1978 prices) of economic growth between 1970-1979,
policy makers are faced with diminishing receipts from petroleum and a
rapidly increasing and largely unskilled labor force. In view of this
situation, increasing investment in skills training becomes more desirable.
Improving the skill levels of new entrants, as well as upgrading the skills
of existing workers, would increase productivity and reduce capital waste due
to inappropriate operation and maintenance of equipment.  Also, increased
skills training opportunities for rural to urban migrants would permit their
employment in the higher productivity economic sectors, thus avoiding undue
expansion of the marginal labor force that is grossly underemployed in low
productivity services. Appropriate training programs and locations can help
in exploiting more fully the potential advantages of the Andean Pact and more
generally facilitate the production of competitive exports. Additionally,
strategically located training facilities can encourage movement of economic
activity towards the smaller population centers with growth potential. This,
in turn, would contribute to a balanced and efficient transition to an
urbanized economy.
1.04      Human Resource Requirements for Development.  Aware of the
potential benefits of investment in skill training facilities, the Ecuadorian
planning body Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo (CONADE), has prepared plans for
the formation of the human resources required for attaining planned economic
rates of growth. These requirements are based upon the population census of
1974. They are projected on the basis of labor force growth estimates,
actual economic growth through 1980 and a planned growth rate of about 6%
during the period of 1981 through 1985. The following table provides the
projected size of the labor force in 1986, its composition by occupational
category and the average annual demand during the 1974-85 period.

through 1980; (ii) planned economic growth from 1981 through 1985; and
(iii) attrition. Allowances have also been made for projected
increases in labor efficiency.
Table 1.1 indicates substantial annual increases in industrial workers
needed in the order of about 30,000 new artisans and operators each year.
It is estimated that about 18,000 (16%) of those should be skilled workers.



- 3 -
1.05      Insufficient Supply of Skilled Industrial Workers.  Formal
entry-level training is mainly the responsibility of institutionalized
training programs under the Ministry of Labor and large public sector
corporations and, to a lesser extent, the Ministry of Education. The role of
private training institutions, except for the clerical trades, is expected to
diminish even below its current low level as training programs become more
expensive to equip. Estimated total outputs of all institutional sources in
1979-80 were only about 2,000 newly skilled industrial workers as contrasted
to an average annual demand of about 18,000 (para. 1.04). By 1984, the
output from existing institutions and those under implementation are still
not expected to exceed about 3,600 or about 20% of the estimated annual
demand. Additionally, there is a large and continuing demand for upgrading
training for employed workers.
1.06      Causes of Shortage.  The major causes of the short supply are the
low proportion of secondary technical graduates that join the labor force;
inadequate training opportunities in terminal skills programs; and
insufficient regional distribution of terminal skills programs.
1.07      A low proportion of secondary technical graduates join the labor
force. Only about 600 (32%) of the average annual output of about 1,900
industrial graduates. of 1978 and 1979, entered the labor force, with the
remainder continuing on to higher education. This low entry rate, as
contrasted to a more desirable rate of 60-70% in similar countries, is due to
inappropriate curricula, poor equipment and unrestricted university entry
regulations.  The problem in part is being addressed by two projects.  Under
Credit 124-EC l/ the Bank assisted in upgrading the quality of industrial
skills training programs, and increasing their relevance to industrial needs,
In four of the technical secondary schools. The Inter-American Development
Bank is also assisting in upgrading programs in eight additional secondary
technical schools. The project is scheduled to be completed in 1984.
1.08      Inappropriate public and governmental perceptions of the economic
value of vocational-training have resulted in inadequate training
opportunities. Although vocational-technical training has been provided in
the upper secondary system since the middle 1950s, in 1978 industrial courses
comprised only 4.6% of the total enrollments in the technical secondary
1/ Due to implementation difficulties the project was not completed until
1980. Consequently, the first graduates from the updated facilities
were in 1980; however, the industrial training facilities became
operational in 1977-78. Although,data are not yet fully available, it
is expected that about 65%-70% of the students of the improved
secondary programs will enter the work force upon graduation. The
major lessons learned were the difficulties in the timely provision of
counterpart funds by the Ministry of Finance and the inadequacy of
project implementation management by the Ministry of Education.

schools. Furthermore, the low capacity of the non-formal institutional
training sub-sector produced only 2,0()0 new industrial workers in 1980 as
contrasted to an average annual demand of about 18,000. However, it was not
until 1980 that the Government declared vocational skills training as a
priority area in its development planiing and that plans for expansion began
to be made.
1.09      The regional distribution of training opportunities in terminal
skills training programs is inadequate. In 1980 only two public training
centers (Ambato and Cuenca) were available for the three-fourths of the
population living outside the major ciities of Quito and Guayaquil. These
centers, with only about one-third of total enrollments, were operating in
inadequate and poorly equipped rented facilities and offered only short
upgrading and adult training courses, mainly in the business field.
Low Quality of Training Programs
1.10      The second major issue is the low quality of industrial skills
training programs, especially at the secondary levels and in private
programs. The relevance of training to employment needs in the secondary
technical programs, especially in the industrial trades, is low because of
inappropriate curricula, poorly qualified instructors and insufficient
equipment and training materials.
1.11      The low quality is a result of curricula and course syllabi which
are overly theoretical, university-oriented and, consequently, largely
irrelevant to the needs of industry for skilled workers. Quality is also
affected by inadequate inputs from business and industry in maintaining the
relevance of course syllabi due to the lack of functional industrial advisory
and job follow-up systems. The lack of business or industrial experience in
the majority of the instructors resulls in frequent failures in the
application of specific knowledge and skills to industrial work situations.
Poorly equipped laboratories and shops and insufficient training materials
also adversely affect the quality of itraining.
Consequences of Skills Training Inadequacies
1.12      The consequences of these deficiencies are:  a serious shortage in
the number of annual outputs of skillead workers (para. 1.05); and an output
of inadequately skilled and motivated graduates who are reluctant to enter
the work force. The situation is further complicated by the strong social
pressure to continue education. In the final analysis this leads to low
productivity because skilled workers need to spend an inordinate amount of
time in training new workers on the job. In view of the limited
institutional capacity for the training of artisans and operators, signifi-
cantly increased training efforts by both Government and private enterprise
including on-the-job training, will be required to meet projected levels of
demand for skilled workers.

II. THE SECAP VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM
Introduction
2.01      Since 1968 the major responsibility for the training of
semi-skilled and skilled workers has been assigned by law to the Servicio
Ecuatoriano de Capacitacion Profesional (SECAP). SECAP is a semi-autonomous
agency governed by a board of directors representing the Government, private
enterprise and the trade unions. The board is chaired by the Minister of
Labor, of whose ministry SECAP is a dependency.
Major Distinguishing Features
2.02      The SECAP training program is designed to train semi-skilled and
skilled workers through flexible terminal training programs. SECAP's
distinguishing features are:
(a) it is semi-autonomous and operates under a board of directors
representing government, industry and labor unions;
(b) by law about one-half of its operating costs are to be financed
through a payroll tax on business and industry and the remainder
through public budget allocations;
(c) it tends to be responsive to the changing needs of the production
and services sectors through its upgrading courses for employed
adults;
(d) the curricula and course syllabi of its training programs empha-
size the application of knowledge and skills in accordance with
industrial requirements and 65% of the total instruction time is
in applied shopwork;
(e) its training programs are strictly terminal and employment
oriented;
(f) about two-thirds of its trainees, both in full-time and in adult
short courses are from low income urban groups and about one-third
of its participants are women; and
(g) it has a continuous instructor training program.
Objectives
2.03      The SECAP training program has the following major objectives:
(a) expanding the output of skilled workers and middle-level managers
for business and industry;
(b) upgrading the skills of employed workers and retraining workers
for new skills where necessary; and



- 6 -
(c) upgrading the quality of training programs by providing a channel
through which business and industry can participate in program
development and implementation.
Program Description
2.04      Administration.  SECAP has three levels of administration--central,
regional and local. Currently the regional and local levels coincide because
of the low number of training centers.  At the central level policy is
determined by a nine-member Board of Directors chaired by the Minister of
Labor and consisting of the Ministers of Education and Industry, the Director
General of the National Center for Industrial Development (CENDES), two
representatives each from employers and labor unions, and a representative of
the National Development Council (CONAI)E). Normally the Board meets
monthly.  An Executive Director, appointed by the Board of Directors for an
indefinite term, is the chief administrative officer of SECAP. He is
assisted by the five directors of planning and evaluation, legal affairs and
public relations, technical affairs, operations, and administration (Annex
3). The directorate of planning and evaluation, with a professional staff of
12, is responsible for medium and longer term planning, design and
coordination of graduate evaluation studies, and arranging for the design and
construction of new-buildings. The directorate of technical affairs is
responsible for curriculum and course syllabi development and instructor
training. It is staffed by a full time core of six subject-matter
specialists and six teacher trainers. The directorate of operations is
responsible for coordination of local instructional programs, the mobile
training system and instructor recruitment. The directorate of
administration is responsible for financial affairs and personnel records.
2.05      The regional coordinator system will become functional when
justified by greater numbers of centers in the various regions. It will
coordinate training programs between centers within the respective regions to
meet the needs of business and industry. It will also coordinate and
facilitate business, industry and training center relations and student
placement.
2.06      At the local level, the director of each training center is the
chief administrative officer and reporl:s to the Executive Director of SECAP
through the Director of Operations. The center director is assisted by
coordinators of training programs and administrative services who, in turn,
are assisted by the chiefs of training programs. Also, informal representa-
tives of local and regional business and industry advise the director on
training matters and student placement.,
2.07      Recruitment is coordinated al: the national level by the Directorate
of Operations and at the local level by the center directors. The SECAP
program is promoted through radio, television, national and local newspapers
and a variety of brochures and reports. It emphasizes the important role of
skilled workers in economic and social development, describes the kinds of
training programs available, employment opportunities and the placement
system. This promotion is successfully directed towards potential students,
parents, business and industry, and the general public. Applicants for



enrollment greatly exceed the training capacity of all centers and no problem
in student recruitment is expected in the planned expansions.
2.08      Training Centers and Programs of Study.  In 1980 SECAP's training
programs were carried out in six centers, only two of which (operating in
rented facilities) were located outside of the two major cities.  Current
enrollments of full-time and part-time students in morning, afternoon and
evening shifts are shown in Table 2.1.

2.09      The training centers have three types of training programs--
regular full-time programs for youths of 14-18 years of age, adult programs
for new trainees of more than 18 years of age, and upgrading programs for
employed workers. As seen in Table 2.1, upgrading courses for employed
workers dominate the training programs, comprising about 96% of the total.
The regular programs are open to students who have completed a minimum of six
years of schooling. These programs are offered only during the hours of 7 am
to 2:30 pm for five working days per week and 40 weeks per year. The first
two years of training are conducted in the centers and are followed by
center-supervised, on-the-job training for a period of six to twelve months
depending upon the type of skill. The adult programs also require the
completion of at least six years of schooling. These programs are offered
mainly during the afternoon hours of 2:30 to 9 pm, but may be also offered
during the morning hours in some centers. Program length varies from 120 to
2,700 hours with an average of about 1,760 hours. The upgrading programs for
employed workers are offered to employed adults desiring to improve their
skills. With a few exceptions, these programs are taught in the evening
hours from 6 to 9 pm. Program length generally varies from 60 to 480 hours,
with an average of about 240 hours. SECAP also has mobile training courses
which provide short training courses of up to 140 hours duration in small
urban areas and rural communities. Four mobile units are currently
operational in highway and construction machinery maintenance and in farm
tractors and machinery, and overall performance has been good.

2.10      Curriciula and course syllabi have been developed by business and
industrially experienced subject-matter specialists and, in the more
technical fields, by experts from bilal:eral and multilateral assistance
programs. Thus far, 11 specific regular training programs have been
developed for the industrial areas. A wide range of short courses for
commerce, services and the industrial areas have also been completed and
successfully utilized. These curricula and course syllabi are well balanced,
are developed on the modular basis, an(d have an average distribution of 35%
technical theory and 65% technical practice. Basic course syllabi for the
industrial programs are adapted to regional conditions, where appropriate, by
local instructors with the assistance of local industry.
2.11       Instructor Characteristics and Preparation.   With some exceptions
the 210 current full-time instructors are fully qualified pedagogically,
having completed the required pre-service and in-service pedagogical training
program. Their average age is 31, 28% are university graduates, and 72% are
technical secondary school graduates. All instructors of technical courses
are required to have a minimum of three years of industrial experience.
Although the average industrial experience is currently about 11 years,
instructors for the afternoon adult classes are mostly part-time ones
selected from among the full-time reguLar program instructors and from
business and industry. With the exception of full-time supervisors, the
upgrading evening classes are staffed almost entirely by part-time and
experienced technicians and administraltive personnel from business and
industry. Although vocational instructors are paid somewhat less than they
could get in industry, the better working conditions and employee benefits in
SECAP make instructor recruitment relatively easy. They are also able to
teach in the evening classes at extra pay, which can significantly enhance
their earnings.
2.12      The instructor training program is staffed by six full-time,
qualified and experienced professional teacher trainers, and such part-time
trainers on an ad-hoc basis as are required. The training program consists of
a total of 1,320 hours of pre-service and in-service pedagogical courses.
Pre-service courses (400 hours minimum') are conducted in SECAP's inadequate
facilities in Quito, while in-service courses (pedagogy and technology) are
generally conducted in the local centers in modular units of 40 to 120 hours
each. Training curricula and course sylLlabi have been developed with the
assistance of both bilateral and multilateral agencies and additional
assistance is being requested. About 250 instructors participated in
pre-service or in-service training during 1980 and about 300 are expected to
do so in 1981, with about 50% of those being in technical skills upgrading
courses.
2.13      Student Evaluation, Placement: and Follow-up. Student evaluation and
follow-up are joint functions of the local training centers and the central
Directorate of Planning and Evaluation. While some good evaluation and
follow-up studies have been conducted during the past two years, the
currently small (2) and relatively inexperienced staff at the central level



is inadequate to serve the needs of the expanding training program.
Evaluation procedures for day-to-day workshop activities are reasonably
well-developed and formalized. However, evaluation of the in-plant
apprenticeship phase of the training is not sufficiently well-developed or
formalized to provide the quality of required feed-back on job performance.
SECAP realizes the high value of the rapid feedback which this phase of
training can provide.  Consequently, it has obtained bilateral assistance in
upgrading this critical aspect of its training program. Evaluation of certain
aspects of the instructor training program, such as the use of more effective
teaching-learning aids and methodology, is the joint effort of local chiefs
of instruction and the central instructor training department. While this
aspect of evaluation is functioning quite well, improvements are continuing
to be made.
2.14      Job placement is the responsibility of the local training center
administration with the assistance of the central Directorate of Operations.
The placement of graduates is good. A recent follow-up study of a sample of
1976-79 graduates of the regular program shows that 97% were employed in
their fields of study within four months of graduation (60% within one
month). In terms of qualitative abilities, graduates of the regular full-time
programs are expected to perform, after a short period of on-the-job
experience, as medium-level skilled workers. Participants in the upgrading
programs frequently move into technician and mid-management positions.
Financing
2.15      The total capital and recurrent budget of SECAP for 1980 was
S/132.5 million (US$5.3 million), of which about 18% was for capital
investments. This amounted to less than 1% of the total budget allocated to
formal education. About one-half of SECAP's total budget came from the wage
levy (0.5%) on the business and industrial sectors, with the remainder
provided through Government appropriations in conformity with the law
specifying SECAP's sources of finance. In 1981 the wage levy produced a
significantly, and unexpectedly, higher yield. On the other hand, fiscal
problems led the Government to reduce its contribution and to require SECAP
to revise its budgeted recurrent expenditures downward. In part, this also
reflects a recent effort of the Government to limit its contributions to
financing of capital costs, and to let the private sector finance SECAP's
recurrent costs through the wage levy. As a consequence of these actions,
the Government's contribution was limited to about 20% of SECAP's total
budget. As a result of decelerating economic growth, the receipts from the
wage levy are expected to grow slowly in comparison to recurrent expenditures
whose growth will reflect current expansion plans and instructor improve-
ments. Therefore, in the future it will be necessary for the Government to
fund part of the recurrent costs in addition to SECAP's capital investment
program (Table 4.5).
2.16      SECAP currently faces only minor cash flow problems.  Receipts from
the wage levy, which are subject to minimal seasonal variations, are promptly
deposited to SECAP's bank account each month. The Government's contributions
are normally received on a monthly basis, but delays of up to two months have
been experienced.



- la, -
2.17      SECAP's unit recurrent costs in 1980 were reasonable and compare
favorably with othear Latin American countries. 2/ Table 2.2 shows the
average costs per student-hour of instruction for certain selected courses
and programs.
Table 2.2: RECURRENT COSTS PER STUDENT-HOUR OF INSTRUCTION
Type of Program       Costs in US$ Per Student-Hour by Course
Business      Metal Mechanics    Electricity
Regular Full-time    0.22               0.50             0.48

Upgrading             0.28              0.83             0.70
Annual unit recurrent costs per student in the regular industrial
programs averaged about US$830, while those for the business
programs averaged about US$370. These are comparable to other Latin
American countries.
Assessment of Strengths and Weaknesses
2.18      Strengths. The SECAP vocational training program has been
established on a sound basis, appropriately addresses the issues of the
sub-sector and is generally well-designed. Although hindered by insufficient
support by the governments of 1971-79 and instability in staffing at the top
levels of management until late 1979, SECAP has still been able to develop
important strengths. Among them are those of:
(a)  an appropriate administrative and operational structure with
clearly defined areas, authority, responsibility and
cooperation;
(b)  the composition and influence of its board of directors, which
keeps training relevant to national economic planning and the needs
of business and industry (para. 2.04);
(c)  the practical orientation and terminal nature of its curriculum;
2/ The costs per trainee of industrial courses in SENAI of Brazil, for
example, were US$1.27 per hour in 1977.



- 11 -
(d) flexible length, well-balanced and modular curriculum and
course syllabi for most training programs which can quickly respond
to changes in regional and national labor market demands;
(e) a budget system which receives more than one-half of its inputs
from a business and industrial payroll tax;
(f) a strong instructor training staff; and
(g) an effective student recruitment program.
2.19      Weaknesses.  However, the SECAP training program has a number of
deficiencies which must be addressed.  The administration is aware of these
weaknesses and is addressing them. The more critical ones are discussed
below.
(a) Administrative and planning personnel are inadequately experienced,
with about half under 31 years of age and two-thirds having less
than four years of experience (94% less than eight years) in
vocational training. The evaluation program is inadequately
staffed in both numbers and experience (para 2.13); only two
members currently staff the central office.
(b) SECAP has had an inadequate capital and recurrent budget (para.
2.15) in which the Government about matched the receipts from the
wage levy on business and industry.  Increasing receipts from the
wage levy in the past year were offset by the Governments' decision
correspondingly to reduce its contributions. Among other effects,
this has resulted in the recruitment of instructors at the lower
salary scales, thus generally attracting less qualified and
experienced instructors. As SECAP expands and upgrades its
training programs, the Government will need to provide through its
budget a greater share of the total expenses as compared to 1981.
(c) Existing training programs are inadequate in size, type and
regional distribution (para. 2.08). By 1984 SECAP's output will be
meeting only about 7% of the new industrially skilled workers which
the National Development Agency (CONADE) has assigned as its annual
quota.
(d) Inadequate facilities for both pre-service and in-service
instructor training. Current instructor-training facilities at
the central level consist solely of three classrooms on loan from
the commercial training center, one overcrowded office housing the
director and the five full-time teacher trainers, and a reception
room-clerical office shared by two other divisions of SECAP.  There
are no library facilities, nor office space for the preparation of
lecture/training materials by part-time teacher trainers, or model
laboratories for training in the demonstration technique which is
so crucial in vocational training.   Equipment is limited to only
three overhead projectors and one movie projector. Consequently,



- 12 -
teacher trainers do not have the privacy, or materials, required
for the adequate development of lectures or the counseling of
teacher-ltrainees. Neither can proficiency in the demonstration
technique be developed under these conditions. As a result, the
teaching--learning process suffers when the instructors begin
teaching. Furthermore, the estimated 900 new instructors required
during the 1981-90 period cannot be adequately prepared in the
existing facilities.
(e)  Inadequate facilities for the development and printing of
teaching--learning aids and other printed materials required by
SECAP. Planned expansion of training programs will annually
require an estimated 160,000 pieces of instructional materials and
large numbers of evaluation, followup and miscellaneous forms,
instructor handbooks and repcorts. Current facilities consist of a
single olbsolete press operating in temporary quarters which will
not be available after 1984.
Development Plans
2.20      The Government has assigned high priority to vocational skills
training within the 1980-84 Economic Development Plan and has allocated the
responsibility for fulfilling training needs by sector and area to SECAP, the
diversified secondary schools, large public sector corporations and other
public agencies. The following table shows a comparison of the estimated
total average annual demand for newly skilled and upgraded workers in the
occupational categories for which SECAP is responsible, and its corresponding
projected outputs in 1984 and 1987.

a/  Annual supply figures include SECAP outputs from fixed centers, mobile
units and in-plant training. The 1984 supply centers include outputs
from existing centers and mobile units plus projected outputs from the
vocational project (Loan 1157-EC) currently under implementation, while
those for 1987 also include estimated outputs from proposed expansions.
b/  Nearly all upgrading classes are taught at night.
c/  Because of available facilities in the morning shift when commercial
spaces would not be required for the commercial upgrading courses (which
must be only in afternoons and nights), courses for new commercial and
sales workers are offered in cities where the demand is not being met by
other agencies.
d/ See footnote 6/, Table 2.4.
The data in the above table clearly show the serious annual shortfalls of
about 13,000 and 36,000, respectively, in the outputs of both newly skilled
industrial workers and upgraded industrial workers, even after expansion
plans to 1987 have been implemented. As a result of these projected short-
falls output in its areas of responsibility, SECAP has been directed by 1990
to expand its operations and training facilities for skilled workers to help
fulfill these needs. Given the magnitude of the projected shortfall in newly
skilled worker training, SECAP's expansion plans would be fully justified
even if the projected annual economic growth rate dropped to as low as 4% as
the Bank now projects.
2.21    Phase I of SECAP's expansion plans was initiated in the mid-1970s
and is to be completed in late 1982. In late 1975, under Loan 1157-EC,
assistance was provided in expanding the capacity of SECAP's vocational



-- 14 -
training program through: (a) the expansion of the industrial skills training
center in Quito by 600 places; (b) t:he construction of a new industrial
skills center of 1,245 places in Guayaquil; and (c) the purchase of two
mobile training units to provide short-course training for 500 annually in
rural and small town areas. Although the loan was signed in September 1975,
because of government instability, financial difficulties and rapid turnover
in SECAP management, there was little progress in implementation until 1980.
By the end of 1979 the staffing difficulties were overcome and positive steps
in project implementation began to be made. Currently, implementation is
proceeding rapidly and completion of the project is expected during the third
quarter of 1982. Additionally, two small training centers which were con-
structed and equipped through local and bilateral funding became operational
in 1981. The administrative and implementation capabilities of SECAP, with
technical assistance from abroad, is improving satisfactorily. If stability
of staffing continues, as it has since 1979, and with planned specialist
assistance from abroad, it is expected that SECAP can develop the capabili-
ties required for the implementation of its short- and medium-term plans.
2.22      Current plans, to be implemented in two additional phases, are as
follows:

will be expansions of existing centers.
c/ Includes new skills training and upgrading training.
Phase I enrollments were 83% in upgrading courses
while Phase II enrollmLents will be only 76%. Phase
II and III enrollments are additional enrollments.

upgrading courses currently offered are expected to
be phased out as a result of insufficient demand.
d/ Includes both full-time and part-time instructors.



- 15 -
2.23      Planning for the second phase, with bilateral and Bank staff
assistance, is well defined.  It includes plans for increasing training
opportunities to produce an annual output of about 2,600 new skilled workers
and to upgrade the skills of about 10,300 employed workers.   It would also
expand training opportunities in two existing locations to produce about
2,700 additional outputs annually. These figures reflect training capacity
created by Phase II investments. As some of this capacity will be used to
replace existing programs operating in inadequate rented spaces, the figures
differ from those of Table 2.4. Equipment would be upgraded in several
training centers through bilateral and multilateral assistance programs.
2.24      Another immediate priority is the development of an instructional
materials production system and the expansion and upgrading of the instructor
training program (para. 2.19). It is planned to integrate these two programs
and a planned graphic arts training center so as to achieve a high level of
mutual reinforcement. Training requirements for new teachers for the
existing and planned training centers and in-service teachers would be as
follows:

a/ Based on current expansion plans and a 10% attrition
rate.
2.25      More detailed planning of the third phase will be based upon
revised and more definitive data, to be prepared by CONADE, on manpower
requirements for the period 1990-95. The major focus will be placed upon
SECAP's assistance in a large-scale in-plant training scheme. As SECAP does
not currently have the technical capacity to plan adequately the proposed
training scheme, external assistance will be required.
2.26      SECAP realizes that institutional development is of equal priority
to the construction, furnishing and equipping of new training centers. The
current administrative, planning and evalution staff is enthusiastic and
dedicated, but its relative lack of experience in analysis, planning,
developing, managing, and evaluation of training programs requires
remediation. It is seeking assistance in improving its medium- and long-term
planning through improved capabilities in the use of manpower data in



- 16 -
planning training programs which effectively and efficiently meet the needs
of business and industry. Assistance is also being sought in improving its
mobile training program and in developing large-scale in-plant training
programs to help meet the needs for skilled industrial workers for the middle
and late 1980s. Emphasis will be placed upon improving curriculum
development and iLnstructional methodology and technology.
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01      The proposed project would help SECAP to implement the second phase
of its long range development. The proposed project aims at improving
SECAP's vocationatl training programs by :
(a) increasing training capacity for skilled workers to produce an
output of about 2,800 new skilled workers and upgrade the skills of
about 13,400 employed workers;
(b) improving the quality of training through:
- the provision of new equipment for 2,000 students in
existing centers,
- improving and expand:Lng instructor training;
- improving and expanding the production of instructional
materials;
(c) providing more equity in training opportunities through a wider
regional distribution of training centers and mobile training
units;
(d)  improving the management capacity  of SECAP in the areas of
plannin,g, supervision and evaluation processes.
Components and Description
3.02      The proposed project would have the following components,
enrollments and outputs when fully operational in 1986-87:

3.03      The project would assist in expanding existing training capacity in
important fields and places. It would provide financing of construction,
furniture and equipment for 10 new training centers, and additional
classrooms and workshops for two existing training centers. One of these new
centers would be for graphic arts training and would be constructed as a part
of the instructor training and instructional materials production
complex. It would provide the equipment and facilities for all large scale

(US$0.35 million) of the graphic arts training centers which is to be
constructed as a part of the instructor training and instructional
materials production complex.

printing of promotional materials, reports, etc. required by SECAP.  Student
trainees would carry out all the prinling and binding activities. Thus,
student motivation would be enhanced and recurrent costs for consumable
supplies reduced. The project would also finance the replacement of obsolete
equipment and provision of additional equipment for one existing training
center. Three of the new centers would replace centers currently operating
in inadequate rented facilities.
3.04      Enrollmients.  As shown in the following table, the 13 training
centers would be distributed throughout the country with one or more centers
in each of the four SECAP geographical regions, thus benefitting workers not
currently served by SECAP. Training opportunities would be increased and
would be more equitably distributed (para. 2.02) because of this extension
of training facilities into areas not currently served.

a/ The differences between enrollments and outputs before the
project and after the proposed project are not equal to those
shown in Table 3.1 because: (i) the project includes
replacement of three old centers (para. 3.03) having enrollments
both before and after the project; (ii) the three old centers
being replaced had only short upgrading courses with an average
length of 240 hours, and which under the project would include
full-time regular courses of' 3,600 hours in length and requiring
about 40% of the available hours per day; and (iii) during project
implementation some of the upgrading courses currently offered are
expected to be phased out as a result of insufficient demand.

3.06      Teaching Programs.  The curricula and course syllabi (para. 2.10)
are complete for 11 of the 14 programs of study. These have been developed
with the assistance of business, industry and bilateral assistance and are
currently in use in existing training centers. The three new
programs--refrigeration, textiles and shoe making--would be developed under
the project through specialist assistance from abroad and from local
industry. Those specialists would also prepare the equipment lists.
3.07       Teachers.  When fully operal:ional in 1986-87 the project training
centers would require a total of about 500 new instructors of which about 270
would be full-time employees of SECAP. The remaining 230 would be recruited
on an ad-hoc basis from business and industry for the upgrading courses in
the evening class programs. To facilitate the recruitment and training of
these additional instructors, SECAP is expanding and upgrading its instructor
training program. On the basis of current experience (para. 2.11 ) the
recruitment of these numbers of new instructors is not expected to be a
problem. Table 3.4 shows the staff recruitment and development plan for the
years of 1983-1986.

Until late 1984, when the new instructor training center is expected to be
operational, the above training of new instructors will take place mainly in
the existing instructor training center. However, many of the new part-time
instructors will receive their pre-service pedagogical training in ad-hoc
courses conducted in local vocational training centers.
Mobile Training Units (Proposed Outlay:  US$0.20 million, net of
contingencies)



- 21 -
3.08      The proposed project would also enable SECAP to expand its training
programs in small towns and rural communities where fixed centers would not
be economically viable. The five mobile training units to be financed under
the project would supplement the four units already operational, two units
recently donated by bilateral groups and the three units already under pro-
curement. Each mobile unit would consist of a four-wheel drive light truck,
with a specially designed body for transporting and storing the specialized
training equipment with which it is equipped. Each unit would normally be
operated by a single instructor. Local physical facilities and basic equip-
ment would be utilized in the training program. One of the units would
provide training in agricultural mechanics in support of the Government's
agricultural mechanization program. One unit would reinforce the existing
program in metal mechanics. One unit would be used in support of the rapidly
growing electrification program, while the two others would support Govern-
ment efforts in food preservation at the home and small-scale industry
levels. These units would provide training programs of up to 140 hours
duration, utilizing local facilities to the extent practicable, for about
1,000 trainees, or 200 each annually. The course syllabi for the new food
processing program and metal mechanics would be developed with expert assis-
tance under the project, while those for farm machinery and electrification
programs are already in existence. On the basis of current experience,
recruitment and retention of the five instructors required is not expected to
be a problem. All mobile training units would be administered under SECAP's
national coordination plan being developed with bilateral assistance. For
logistical support in terms of repair and maintenance, the mobile units would
work out of local training centers. However, the plan would coordinate, at
the national level, the content, location and duration of training programs
in accordance with regional development plans.
Instructor Training and Instructional Materials Production Complex
(Proposed outlay: US$2.74 million, net of contingencies)
3.09      SECAP's current facilities are inadequate to produce the
instructors and teaching-learning materials required for its planned and
existing training centers (para. 2.19) Consequently, the project would
include financing of construction, furniture and equipment for instructor
training and instructional materials production centers. These two centers
would be included as a part of an educational complex also housing a new
graphic arts training center (para. 3.03), a joint library and an audi-
torium.
3.10      Instructor Training Center.  The proposed center would help SECAP
to prepare the 270 full-time and the 230 part-time instructors required for
the new training centers and the 75-80 estimated annual recurrent needs of
the existing centers (paras. 2.23 and 3.07). The center would have an annual
capacity, beginning in late 1984, of 130 full-time trainees (including admin-
istrative trainees) and an equal number in in-service upgrading courses
during the vacation season. It would also permit the training of about 70
new instructors annually for other public training agencies after SECAP's
initial training requirements are met. Table 3.5 shows the projected output
by category and year for the period of 1984 through 1989.

a/  The annual outputs during 1985 and 1986 are also less than require-
ments shown :Ln Table 3.4 as an annual capacity of 130 in each of the
new instructor and upgrading programs is considered the maximum
capacity required at the central training center. The remaining
annual requirement of 20 new instructors (i.e. difference between
130 and 150) would receive in-service training in local skills centers
rather than pre-service training.
b/ Training wou:Ld be conducted in old facilities.
c/  Training wouLd be conducted in old facilities and in the new center as
it becomes available in late 1984.
3.11      Because of the critical importance of the demonstration technique
in skills training programs, the center would include a small model indus-
trial shop and a model business office/laboratory. The current instructor
training staff of six is well qualified in terms of training and experience.
The instructor training staff would be increased by about three full-time
staff and would aLso include part-time staff available on an ad-hoc basis
from other teacher training instituticins. To further upgrade staff competen-
cies 24 staff-months of specialist assistance and 48 staff-months of short-
term (six months) internships in similar institutions abroad would be
included under the project (para. 3.14).
3.12      Instructional Materials Production Center.  The production of
teaching-learning aids is currently operational only on an ad-hoc basis and
the quantity and quality of materials is minimal (para. 2.19). The proposed
center would produce all bulk promotional and instructional printed materials
except for textbooks and some types of specialized laboratory manuals. It
would include offices; audio and photographic facilities; art and



- 23 -
composition rooms and a printing and binding shop to be shared with the
graphic arts training center (para. 3.03); and service and distribution
facilities. The total area required, not including shared spaces, would be
190 square meters. The equipment would include a van for delivery of
instructional materials to the training centers.  Staffing would include a
director, six production technicians (also shared with the graphic arts
training center) and such support personnel as may be required. The staff
and trainees of the adjacent instructor training center would work closely
with the center in the preparation of teaching-learning aids for mass
production, thus enhancing their own overall instructional skills. All large
scale printing of training and promotional materials and other bulk materials
would be carried out by the students enrolled in the graphic arts training
center (para. 3.03). Because of the very low labor costs and the sharing of
equipment and physical spaces, overall production costs would be cheaper than
contracting such production with private firms. The major portion of the
basic materials would be prepared by the regular subject matter specialists
of SECAP, training center instructors, and business and industry consul-
tants. Based upon recruitment goals and total enrollments, the annual
production of the center would exceed 30,000 pieces of promotional material,
90,000 shop job-sheets, and 40,000 laboratory manuals. Large numbers of
evaluation and follow-up record forms, and miscellaneous items would also be
produced.
Further Development Plans
3.13      Sound development planning is critical to the medium- and long-term
success of SECAP. Although the short-term planning, on which the proposed
project is based, is well defined, only preliminary planning for medium- and
long-term development has been done (para. 2.21). SECAP has requested that
12 staff-months of specialist assistance in planning and evalution be
provided in the proposed project to help improve and refine its planning
capability (para. 3.14). This would complement technical assistance already
received in this area through bilateral sources. During negotiations the
Government has provided an assurance that its draft development plan to 1990
would be sent to the Bank for review and comments by December 31, 1984. The
plan would include:
(a) estimates of demand for skilled workers and technicians by
industry, occupation and geographical area;
(b) SECAP's training plans, including enrollments, outputs and
instructor requirements by training program and geographical
distribution; and
(c) capital investment requirements, recurrent cost projections and a
schedule of implementation.



- 24 -
Technical Assistance (Proposed outlay: US$0.93 million, net of
contingencies)
3.14      The project's expected contribution to institutional building would
be of equal importance with the trained manpower outputs of the institutions
(para. 2.24). In recognition of its weaknesses (para. 2.19), SECAP
management concurs that the major emphasis in the technical assistance
program should be upon institutional planning and management aspects of
vocational trainting. Consequently, a substantial technical assistance
component (Tablet 3.6) would be required. About 20 consultants would be
recruited for a total of about 14 staff-years to assist in improving SECAP's
institutional capability in:
(a)  planning, evaluation and institutional organization and management;
(b)  instructor training and teaching-learning aids development;
(c)  mobile and in-plant training program development and management;
(d)  curriculum and course syllabi development;
(e)  equipment use and maintenance training; and
(f)  middle management training program development and implementation.
Additionally, short-term internships of two to six months would be provided
for about 15 center directors, 16 inst:ructors, 15 technical specialists,
eight teacher trainers, and project implementation personnel.  These
internships would total about 16 staff-years and would take place in similar
institutions in Latin America and selected European countries.

3.15      Consultants and salaries for five of the 14 staff-years of
consultant services are expected to be provided by bilateral agencies under
existing arrangements, and most of these same agencies would be receiving
interns for training in their own national training centers.  Because of the
size and complexity of the technical assistance program, considerable skill
would be required in its management, recruitment of specialists and placement
of interns in appropriate institutions abroad. Consequently, the project
administration would include a qualified staff member to coordinate the
technical assistance program and to work closely with the various cooperating
bilateral agencies.
3.16      The proposed technical assistance program would be in addition to
bilateral and multilateral assistance already obtained or being negotiated
for the project by SECAP. Assistance already agreed upon includes 164
staff-months of specialist assistance from Spain in the areas of instructor
training and institutional planning; 36 staff months in Italy in graphic arts
instructor training; 30 staff-months from the United Kingdom in program
development for the electricity/electronics trades; and 22 staff-months from
ILO for developing special training schemes for marginal urban population.
The total value of these specialist services are estimated at about US$1.2
million equivalent.  Additionally, negotiations are underway for up to 260
months of specialist services from West Germany to continue the development
of the in-plant apprenticeship program; for up to 180 months of specialist
services from Italy for the development of graphic arts training programs;
and an undetermined amount to continue the cooperation with SENAI-Brazil.

4.03      Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated civil works costs for training
centers have been derived from construction contracts recently awarded by
SECAP for the construction of instructional facilities in Quito, Guayaquil
and Ibarra. Furniture costs for the same centers have been estimated at 8%
of the cost of construction of the buildings. The construction costs of the
center located at Guayaquil and the Instructor and Graphics Center located at
Quito have been based upon estimates made by private contractors. Furniture
costs for the same centers have been estimated as 4% of the cost of
construction of the buildings.  The cost of site works has been estimated as
15% of the cost of construction of the buildings. Professional fees have
been estimated as 15% of the cost of construction plus cost of the site
works. Equipment costs are based on current CIF unit prices for detailed

lists of similar programs in other countries and are adjusted upward to
include local transportation and installation. Technical assistance costs
for experts, including salaries, are based upon an average base cost of
US$3,975 per staff-month.  Salaries of experts, with two exceptions, would be
provided by cooperating bilateral agencies under existing bilateral
agreements. Costs of fellowships abroad are based upon US$1,200 per
staff-month and US$1,500 travel costs per individual.
4.04      Comparison of Unit Cost Estimates.  The unit area and unit capital
cost estimates are shown in the following table:

4.05      Contingency Allowances.  Contingency allowances have been added to
the base line cost estimates as follows:
(a) Physical contingencies: 10% for buildings (including site works),
professional fees, furniture,, equipment (including mobile units),
experts, fellowships and project administration; and
(b) Price contingencies: Expected price increases by category are
shown in the Table 4.4 and have been estimated on base line costs
plus physical contingencies beginning April 1, 1982, and finishing
by June 30, 1986.

b/ It is assumed that price increases for equipment, to be effective, would
follow international price trends since they are to be procured largely
through ICB (para. 4.18); i.e., local suppliers would likely not be
awarded contracts if their price increases exceed international
competitive levels.
c/ Price increase projections for equipment are based upon those derived by
a Bank study group which makes a periodic in-depth review of price
increase projections made by major international education equipment
suppliers from several countries.
4.06      Prices are expected to increase during the five-year implementation
period by a total of about 36% for civil works, 16% for professional fees,
38% for furniture, 32% for equipment, 16% for experts, 22% for fellowships,
and 34% for project administration.
4.07      Foreign Exchange Component.  The foreign exchange component is
estimated at about US$16.25 million equivalent or about 49% of total project
costs. The calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the
assumption that: (a) all construction and related professional services
would be awarded to local firms; (b) all furniture would be awarded to local
suppliers; and (c) all equipment (including mobile units), except for minimal
amounts, would be awarded as a result of international competitive bidding
(ICB). The resulting foreign content of each category of expenditure was
calculated as 25% for construction (including site works), 50% for furniture,
95% for equipment, 85% for experts, 90% for fellowships, and 20% for selected
personnel, travel and materials purchase for project administration.
Recurrent Cost Implications
4.08      When fully operational in 1986-87, the project would require an
estimated increase in SECAP's recurrent budget of about S/80 million (US$3.2
million) in constant 1981 prices. This increase would amount to about 58% of



- 30 -
SECAP's 1981 recurrent budget of about S/137 million.4/ Taking into account
the additional recurrent costs required by the training centers under Loan
1157-EC, SECAP's recurrent budget for both projects would require an increase
of about 90% (or S/123 million at constant 1981 prices) over its 1981
budget. This would represent only about 1.5% of the total recurrent costs
for formal education in 1980 and, in view of the high priority assigned to
skilled worker training, is affordable. These increases in recurrent costs
include those resulting from the planned recruitment of future instructors
having higher levels of qualificatiorLs and experience than is the current
practice. These increases also result from the planned increase in the
costlier industrial skills training program. Recurrent costs per student in
the full-time regular programs would range from an average of S/6,000 for the
commerce and services programs to S/21,000 for the industrial skills programs
(average S/17,000) and are comparable to other Latin American countries.
Those for adult training would range from S/6,000 to S/17,000, respectively,
for the commerce and industrial programs (average S/14,000), whereas those
for adult upgrading programs range from only S/850 to S/2,500 (average
S/1,400). The estimated recurrent costs of the project and of the total
SECAP training program for the years of 1981 to 1986 are shown in the Table
4.5 below:

Recurrent costs of the magnitude shown in Table 4.5 would require that toward
the end of the implementation period the Government should contribute about
half as much as the projected contributions from the wage levy. This
estimate is based on the expectations that industries' resistance to proposed
increases in the wage levy over its current 0.5% will continue until SECAP
4/ SECAP's actual recurrent budget in 1981 was about S/127 million.
Because of the shortfall in Government contributions (para. 2.15) the
figure of S/137 million corresponds to a normal level of operating
expenditures.

completes its expansion and improvements. At that time it should be able to
demonstrate convincingly the increased economic value of its training
program. To help assure that the total SECAP training program would operate
without sacrificing desirable quality standards, during negotiations the
Government has provided an assurance that in addition to receipts from the
wage levy (para. 2.15), it would promptly make up the difference between
receipts from the wage levy and SECAP's recurrent budget so as to meet fully
all SECAP's training costs including costs of the project.
Project Financing and Disbursement Plan
4.09       Financing.  The total project cost of US$33.39 million would be
financed as follows:
(a) the proposed Bank loan of US$16 million would finance about 48% of
total project costs, equivalent to about 97% of the foreign costs,
as well as a front-end fee of about US$240 thousand;
(b) a Canadian supplier's credit would finance US$0.40 million,
equivalent to about 2% of the foreign costs;
(c) consultant salaries in the amount of about US$0.21 million, equal
to about 1% of the foreign costs, would be financed under bilateral
agreements with several Latin American Governments; and
(d) the Government would finance about 51% of total costs, equivalent
to about 100% of local costs.
To facilitate project execution before the proposed loan would be effective
and to recruit long-term specialist assistance, it is recommended that up to
US$0.1 million of retroactive financing be made available for expenditures
after June 15, 1981 on designs of civil works and technical assistance.
4.10       Disbursement Plan.  The proposed loan is expected to be disbursed
over a period of about four and one-half years (July 1, 1982 to
December 31, 1986) against fully documented withdrawal
applications, to cover (Annex 4):
(a) 24% of total expenditures for civil works plus professional fees;
(b) 100% of total costs for imported equipment and ex-factory costs
for locally produced goods, including installation costs where
applicable;
(c) 85% of local expenditures for locally procured goods;
(d) 100% of total costs for mobile training units;
(e) 100% of the total expenditures for technical assistance; and
(f) 100% of the cost of project administration for selected
personnel.
4.11       The estimated schedule of disbursements, based on the implementa-
tion schedule by calendar and IBRD fiscal years, is shown in Table 4.6:

4.12      The estimated schedule of disbursements for the proposed project is
based upon detailed implementation schedules (para. 4.14 and Table 4.7).The
estimated disbursement period of about 4.5 years is about half as long as
that of the country-wide disbursement profile of Ecuador for the period of
FY1970-1980. It iis about two-thirds as long as that expected for the current
SECAP (Loan 1157--EC) project which is expected to be completed in mid-1982.
However, the shorter implementation period is considered feasible on the
basis of: (a) a much more stable and experienced administrative and
supervisory staff in SECAP than was the situation in earlier years; (b) the
experience that SECAP's implementation personnel have gained as a result of
the previous project; (c) project preparation will be in a more advanced
state at the time of negotiations; and (d) uniform flow of funding of SECAP's
total training pr-ogram as a result of the Governments' firm commitment to
vocational skills training in the 1980-84 Economic Development Plan (para.
2.20).
Implementation, Procurement and Auditing
4.13      The existing Project Implementation Unit is being strengthened and
would be responsible for coordinating and monitoring the various project
activities. It would become an integrated part of SECAP and would include
key staff members having experience in implementing the project under Loan
1157-EC. The Unit would include a project director; coordinators (3) of
civil works, furniture and equipment, and technical assistance; project
accounting and financial staff (3); and such support personnel as may be
required. The Unit would be directly responsible to SECAP's executive
director. It would coordinate its activities with the various SECAP direc-
torates through a standing committee composed of the director of the Project
Unit and the SECAP directors. During negotiations the Government has
provided an assurance that SECAP would strengthen and maintain the project
implementation unit to assure efficient execution of the project. To help
assure quality and avoid recruitment delays in critical positions, proceeds
of the loan would be disbursed against the salaries of key personnel.



- 33 -
Budgetary arrangements are being made for the additional staffing, and no
problem is expected in the recruitment of appropriate personnel.
4.14      Implementation Schedule.  The proposed project is expected to be
implemented in five years. The construction, furnishing and equipping of all
the centers and the technical assistance program are scheduled to be
completed by June 30, 1986. These schedules are considered to be reasonable,
within the capacity of SECAP, and would serve as the basis for monitoring
project implementation. Expected completion rates (in accumulated
percentage) are listed in the Table 4.7. The Closing Date for the proposed
loan would be December 31, 1986, to allow sufficient time for submission of
final withdrawal applications.

- 34 -
4.15      Procurement. Civil works costs totalling US$11.3 million (base
costs) would involve 12 sites in 9 provinces. None of the individual contract
costs, averaging US$0.94 million each, would be great enough to attract
foreign bidders. Ecuador's construction industry is sufficiently well-
developed and capable of executing the civil works at costs competitive with
international bidders. Consequently, civil works contracts would be awarded
on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) under normal government
procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank and do not preclude foreign con-
tractors from bidding. Sites for 11 of the centers have already been
acquired and the formal acquisition of the remaining site is being pro-
cessed. Civil works designs are being done by consultants from the private
sector on the basis of educational and architectural worksheets agreed with
the Bank. Des:Lgns for the commerce and services training center in Guayaquil
have been preceded by a study to determine the economic feasibility of rent-
ing out the ground floor for commercial enterprises.
4.16      The furniture manufacturing industry in Ecuador is also well-
developed and competitive. Furniture needs in the amount of US$0.6 million
(base costs) would be procured locally by the Government's central purchasing
agency through standard procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.
4.17      Equipment in the amount of about US$8.3 million (base costs) would
be procured mainly through ICB. Preparation of equipment lists, specifi-
cations and bidding documents are under preparation from similar lists
prepared for the ongoing vocational training project. New lists would be
required for only three new training fields (para. 3.06). These lists and
documents would be presented to the Bank for review and comment prior to
procurement. A condition of approval of bidding documents for the mobile
training units would be the presentation to the Bank of a satisfactory plan
for the coordination of their use. Furniture and equipment items would be
grouped to the extent possible in packages to permit bulk procurement.
Equipment packages in excess of US$200,000 would be procured through ICB
procedures. Packages of US$20,000 to US$200,000, up to about 15% of total
equipment costs, would be locally procured through regular government
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. Small items or groups of items
estimated to cost no more than US$20,000, not to exceed US$200,000, or items
of a specialized nature for which ICB and LCB would not be practical, would
be procured through local shopping. In all cases of local procurement it is
expected that most equipment items would be foreign made. Under the above
procedures, it is expected that about 86% of the total value of equipment
would be procured through ICB, 10% through LCB and 4% through local shopping.
4.18      Recommended contract awaxrds for equipment of less than US$200,000
would not be referred to the Bank Eor prior review. SECAP would retain bid
evaluations and contracts for random ex post review by Bank staff during
supervision missions. For the purpose of comparing foreign and local bids,
domestic manufacturers would be al:Lowed a margin of preference equal to the
prevailing tariff or 15% of CIF costs of imported goods, whichever is lower.



- 35 -
4.19      Auditing.  The project accounts would be subjected to the same
auditing procedures as SECAP in its entirety.  SECAP is subject to both
internal and external auditing conducted by the National Controller's
Department. SECAP is legally obligated to include in its payroll three
Controller's employees for day-to-day internal auditing of its financial
operations. In addition, the Controller sends periodically (but not later
than every two years) unannounced teams of specialists for external auditing
of SECAP's financial accounts and operations. Both internal and external
auditors submit reports with their findings and recommmendations to the
National Controller's Department, which would be made available to the Bank
for its review and comments. During negotiations the Government has provided
an assurance that the annual auditor's report and the certified financial
statements of SECAP would be forwarded to the Bank for its review and
comments within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.20      Monitoring.   Efficient monitoring and careful supervision is
essential for proper project implementation. To help assure greater
efficiency the project unit director would be assisted by three coordinators
(para. 4.13). To facilitate construction of the new centers, private
consulting architects would be retained for day-to-day supervision of civil
works. Under the supervision of the project coordinator of civil works,
SECAP's own architects would closely monitor actual progress in both design
and construction. Equipment and furniture procurement and installation would
be the responsiblity of the coordinator of equipment and furniture and his
staff. The recruitment and utilization of technical consultants and the
placement of fellowships trainees abroad would be the responsibility of the
coordinator of technical assistance. Appropriate checklists for use in
implementation monitoring are being developed for each of the areas of civil
works, furniture, equipment, and technical assistance.
4.21      Evaluation.  The directorate of planning and evaluation (para.
2.13), with the aid of technical assistance provided under the project would
coordinate team efforts in the evaluation of project implementation and its
impact on the manpower training system and on training and employment
opportunities for women. This directorate would also coordinate the
activities of individual training center supervisory personnel in the
evaluation of the job performance of all regular course trainees in the
on-thejob phase of training and also in the job performance of a selected
number of graduates from each center. Evaluation studies would include, on a
pilot basis, a follow-up study of increased levels of job performance
resulting from upgrading training in selected skills areas. Knowledge and
insights gained from the evaluation process will be fed back into the system
for the periodic upgrading of the curricula and course syllabi.

V. BENEF:[TS AND RISKS
Benefits
5.01      The proposed project's expected contribution to the institutional
development of SECAP is of equal importance to improvements in the quantity
and quality of skilled manpower. The planning, administrative and
supervisory capabilities of SECAP's personnel would be improved and broadened
through a coordinated program of specialist assistance and internship
training abroad (para. 3.14). These enhanced capabilities would result in
more effective skills training programs and a better trained worker for
business and industry. The major areas of emphasis would be on medium- and
long-term planning, institutional organization and management, curriculum
and course syllabi development and evaluation, and instructor training.
Improvements in the quantity and quality of trained workers would result from
the construction, furnishing and equipping of 10 new training centers,
expansion of two centers, re-equippirng of one center, provision of an
instructor training center and expanding and improving the production of
instructional materials. Furthermore, the training centers would be widely
dispersed throughout the country and would more equitably distribute training
opportunities for the urban poor and women (para. 3.04).
5.02      The major quantifiable benefits of the project would be an
additional annua:L output (including mobile unit programs) of about 1,900
skilled industrial workers and about 950 skilled commerce, agricultural and
services workers,, of which about two-thirds would be from the urban poor, and
130 new technical instructors. Additionally, about 5,100 employed industrial
workers, 8,300 commerce, agricultural and services workers, and 130 existing
instructors would receive training each year, thus improving their produc-
tivity. About one-third of the participants are expected to be women.
Risks
5.03      The proposed loan entails some risks in terms of implementation
capacity, instructor recruitment, and local cost financing. To minimize the
risks in project implementation, SECAP would recruit additional high level
project management staff and specialist assistance to upgrade the
capabilities of its staff in project implementation, monitoring and
evaluation (paras. 3.14, 4.13, 4.20, and 4.21). There would be some risk
that shortages may develop in instructor recruitment. This will be closely
monitored during supervision. Local cost financing of the project could be
affected by unforeseen problems in the Ecuadorian economy. However, given
the high priority that the 1980-84 economic development plan places on
expansions in vocational training (para. 2.20), the financial risk is
considered acceptable.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations the Government has provided assurances that:
(a)  SECAP's draft development plan to 1990 would be sent to the Bank
for review and comments by December 31, 1984 (para. 3.13);
(b)  it would promptly make up the difference between receipts from the
wage levy and SECAP's recurrent budget so as to meet fully all
SECAP's training costs including costs of the project (para. 4.08);
(c)  SECAP would strengthen and maintain the project implementation unit
to assure efficient execution of the project (para. 4.13); and
(d)  the annual auditor's report and the certified financial statements
of SECAP would be forwarded to the Bank for its review and comments
within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year (para. 4.19).
6.02      Up to US$0.1 million of retroactive financing should be made
available for expenditures on designs of civil works and technical assistance
after June 15, 1981 (para. 4.09).
6.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Government of Ecuador of US$16 million
equivalent, with a term of 17 years including a grace period of four years.

COMPARATIVE EDUCATION DATA ARE USEFUL IN THE EVALUATION OF VARIOUS EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND ANALYSIS OF RELATIVE STAGES OF EDUCATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. NOWEVER,ON THE BASIS OF THE PRESENT DATA,CROSS-NATIONAL COMPARISON SHOULD BE APPROACHED WITH
GREAT CAUTION, DATA PRESENTED IN THE ABOVE TABLE NAVE BEEN COLLECTED LARGELY BY THE BANK MISSIONS FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES; THE
REMAINDER ARE STAFF ESTIMATES OR DATA FROM UNESCO, EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO STANDARDIZE DEFINITIONS AND WITHIN LIMITS, TO CHECK 'THE
ACCURACY OF THE DATA. NEVERTHELESS,SUCH DATA ARE STILL IMPERFECT IN SEVERAL RESPECTS AND THE BANK IS WORKING TO IMPROVE THEM
PROGRESSIVELY ON THE OCCASION OF ITS OPERATIONAL WORK. IN THE USE OF THESE DATA, THE FOLLOWING QUALIFICATIONS SHOULD BE BORNE IN
MIND:
(1)'EDUCATION' AS DEFINED IN THE TABLE INCLUDES ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING, FORMAL AND NON-FORMAL;
(2) 'PRIMARY EDUCATION REFERS TO EDUCATION AT THE FIRST LEVEL AND 'SECONDARY' EDUCATION REFERS TO ALL EDUCATION AT THE SECONDARY
LEVEL REGARDLESS OF TYPE (E.G. GENERAL, TECHNICAL, AGRICULTURAL) 
(3) 'LITERACY RATES'(COL.6) ARE OFTEN OBTAINED FROM COUNTRY CENSUSES. IN MANY COUNTRIES THEY ARE ONLY APPRZOXIMATIONS AND IT Is
DOUBTFUL THAT ANY UNIFORM DEFINITION OF 'LITERATE' HAS BEEN FOLLOWED CONSISTENTLY;
(4)'PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN EDUCATION' (COLS 4 AND 5) REFERS TO ALL CAPITAL AND RECURRENT EXP~ENDITURES DEVOTED TO EDUCATION BY
PUBLIC AND QUASI-PUBLIC AGENCIES;
(5. ENROLLMENT RATIOS'(COLS 7, 12 AND 14) REFER TO SCHOOL YEAR AND MEAN THE PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE CHILDREN ENROLLED FULL-TIME
IN THE APPROPRIATE SCHOOL, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BY LEVEL. THEY ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO A WIDE MARGIN OF ERROR IN THE DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES OWING TO VARIATION IN THE ACCURACY OF BASIC DATA(I.E. AGE-SPECIFIC POPULATION AND ENROLLMENTS). ENROLLMENT FIGURES
FREOUENTLY ARE HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ACTUALLY IN SCHOOL. OVERAGED STUDENTS WHOSE INCLUSION IS INDICATED BY
FOOTNOTES ALSO CAN INFLATE THE RATIOS.

Criteria for Site Selection
The following criteria for use in selection of sites have been
agreed between CO'IET and the Bank.
A. Size of Sites. The size of the site would be determined on
the basis of the:
1. Ratio of total ground area occupied by the buildings to the
total area of the site. This ratio, as a percentage, will
vary from 30% as optimum to 60% as the maximum.
2. Consideration of probability and size of future expansion
would determine the acceptable ratio within the above
range.
3. Recreational sports fields requirements would be additional
to the above ratios.
B. Ratio of Street Frontage to Depth of Site.
1. Minimum ratio of 1:1.
2. Maximum ratio of 1:3.
C. Topographic Characteristics.
1. Maximum slope of site not greater than 10%.
2. Site would not be subject to flooding.
3. Load bearing capacity of subsoil shall not be less than
0.8 kilos/cm2 and the subsoil shall not have a high expansion
factor.
D. Availability of Public Services. Available public services must
include:
1. Electrical service of both single and three-phase and with
sufficient load capacity.
2. Potable water supply and waste water system.
3. Telephone service.
4. Acceptable access by hard-surfaced roads or all-weather gravel
roads.
5. Public transportation to be made available from 6:00 a.m. to
10:00 p.m. daily.
E. Location. Sites should be selected on the basis of:
1. Nearness to industrial zones in city of location.
2. Nearness to working class residential area.
