I. AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Agricultural Production and Trade
Land Use
1.01      The land area of Syria totals 18.5 million ha, of which about 6 mil-
lion ha are cultivated, the remaining two thirds of the country being too arid
for cultivation. About 530,000 ha are irrigated. Agricultural production
from rainfed lands varies greatly from year to year as a result of the highly
erratic amount and monthly distribution of rainfall, most falling in the
period October through May. Average annual rainfall varies greatly across the
country from about 600 mm along the Mediterranean coast, rising to over 1,000
mm in the Western mountains, and then falling away towards the east and south
to below 250 mm. The major crops under rainfed cultivation are cereals, and
secondary crops include olives and fruits. Livestock (mainly sheep) is an
important sub-sector. In the irrigated areas cotton and wheat are the main
crops.
Place of Agriculture in the Economy
1.02      During the period 1966-73 agriculture accounted for a quarter of GDP
although the annual figures varied between 23% and 36% largely due to the
variability of rainfed production. Since 1973 when the value of petroleum
revenues increased greatly, the share of agriculture in GDP has fallen, and
averaged 19% during the period 1974-1976. Even so, agriculture is still a key
sector. In a national population of nearly 8 million, it accounts for just
over half of total employment, providing work for 900,000 persons of whom
700,000 are self-employed and family workers. Unemployment in the sector is
estimated at 2%, compared with a national unemployment level of 5%. There is
little urban migration from the rural areas.
1.03      The relatively low rate of growth in agricultural output from 1967-
1974 (2% annually) was reflected in declining agricultural exports. The share
of agriculture in exports which was two-thirds in 1971, fell sharply to 20% in
1975. This was mostly due to the rapid increase in the value of petroleum
exports. Agricultural exports still account for about 60% of the value of
exports excluding petroleum but they have remained static as shown below:
Table 1.1: AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS (GOODS ONLY)
Exports                                              1963      1971       1975
Total (SL Million in Current Prices)                  720       790      3,440
Agricultural (SL Million in Current Prices)           660       520        710
Agricultural Exports as Percentage of Total            92        66         21
Cotton is the single most important agricultural export accounting for three
quarters of the total by value. About 80% of the cotton produced is exported
and the rest is retained for use by the domestic textile industry.



1.04      Agricultural imports have shown some tendency to increase.  Syria
has become a net importer of wheat although during the 1960s wheat was a major
export earner. Because of the enormous changes in annual production of wheat,
which is mainly a rainfed crop, the quantity imported varies greatly from year
to year, but since 1970 imports have on average amounted to 200,000 tons
annually with sizeable quantities exported only in 1972 which was a favorable
rainfall year. Sugar imports have also increased since the 1960s, and during
the period 1970-1976 have averaged about 110,000 tons annually.
B. Agricultural Policies and Planning
Five-Year Plans
1.05      The overall objectives of agricultural policy are self sufficiency
in food production, without reducing the present level of agricultural
exports. Agricultural policy in Syria is carried out through a system of
laws, controlled prices and institutional arrangements designed to provide
targeted quantities of food and industrial crops. Policy is set out in the
Five-Year Plan. The third Five-Year Plan (1971-1975) provided targets for
crop and livestock production, which were largely met as a result of excep-
tionally favorable climatic conditions in 1974 and 1975, inspite of a drought
in 1973, and the 1973 war with Israel. The main rainfed crops, wheat and
barley, exceeded their planned targets due to the good weather. Performance
in the irrigated sector was disappointing and cotton and sugar beet, both
irrigated crops, failed to make their targets as discussed below. Investments
achieved were less than half the budget allocation. The fourth Five-Year Plan
(1976-1980) was highly optimistic both in terms of investments foreseen and
target rates of growth of output expected. It has been shelved following the
Government's financial crisis resulting from a number of factors including a
slowdown in Arab aid, reduced oil revenues and Syria's recent involvement in
Lebanon.
Problems in Plan Implementation
1.06      Three broad issues have a major impact in constraining the growth of
Syrian agricultural production (a) the relationship between physical produc-
tion targets and pricing policy; (b) lack of institutional capability in plan-
ning and implementation; and (c) poor allocation of investments.
1.07      Physical Targets.  In the agricultural sector, as with other sectors
in Syria, there is a tendency towards centralized control, with production
based on physical targets and quotas. Thus, by the end of the third Plan
period when it was clear that the long term rate of agricultural growth (2%)
was less than the population growth (3.3%), Government decided to enforce
cropping patterns and cultivation practices so that specified annual produc-
tion targets could be met and the gap could be closed. To assist this con-
trol, Law 14 of 1975 was passed which obliges farmers to follow a set cropping
pattern, outlined each year in the detailed Annual Agricultural Production
Plan of the Ministry of Agriculture. The objective of the law has only been



- 3 -
partially achieved since farmers must submit to licensing control and often
to an unrealistic cropping pattern if they require credit. Some prefer to go
without.
1.08      Pricing Policies.  Prices are controlled for most agricultural com-
modities including cereals, sugar beet and cotton. The controlled price
system is regarded principally as a tool of social policy for income distri-
bution and subsidy purposes rather than as a mean of adjusting agricultural
production. In the recent past, farmgate prices paid for most crops by the
State Monopoly agencies have been well below the equivalent border price in
international trade, partly as a result of subsidies on certain "vital" food-
stuffs such as bread and sugar, and partly because the prices fixed annually
have lagged behind increases in world prices. Prices of some purchased inputs
have also been subsidized but their availability has been limited and the cost
increases in other inputs have reduced the financial incentive for farmers to
produce more. Thus, in practice, prices remain the main incentive or disin-
centive to increasing production in Syria and during the last 5-Year Plan
period, they have acted generally as a disincentive. A notable exception was
fruits and vegetables production for which a free market system exists and
which exceeded their planned 5-year targets in response to strong price incen-
tives.
1.09      Lack of Institutional Capability.  Syria does not have sufficient
agricultural data and trained manpower to prepare the detailed operational
production plans so necessary to a successful centrally controlled produc-
tion system. As a result the 5-Year and Annual Agricultural Plans are often
unrealistic. Farm inputs distributed through Government agencies are not
available at the right time as a result of poor planning.
1.10      Misallocation of Investments.  Due to the inadequacies of the plan-
ning mechanism there has been no causal relationship between the investment
proposed in the agricultural sector and the targets to be achieved. There
has been too great an emphasis on major infrastructure in the Euphrates Valley
(discussed in para. 1.20) and too little on the complementary investments
needed to obtain full production from the new and existing infrastructure.
In particular there has been a lack of agricultural research and field level
trials, so that there is very little knowledge available on such aspects as
optimum commercial varieties and fertilizer rates for different crops under
rainfed and irrigated conditions in different parts of the country. Moreover,
since 1970 there has been no agricultural extension service to disseminate
information to farmers.
Action Proposed by Government
1.11      Since the end of 1976, Government has initiated a major review at
all levels of its agricultural policy and planning mechanism concluding that
(i) the agricultural sector is of fundamental importance in national develop-
ment; (ii) the trained manpower resources are not sufficient to permit detailed
physical planning of the economy; and (iii) investments must be directed to
top priorities only. A dialogue has been opened with the farmers and it is
likely that Government will provide positive incentives rather than physical



controls, liberalize the private sector, reorganize agricultural administra-
tion, and reestablish an agricultural extension service. While recognition of
the problem is a step in the right direction, Syria would not achieve its
goals without reorganization and outside help.
Bank's Role in the Agricultural Sector
1.12      Production by the agricultural sector will have to increase rapidly
during the next decade to provide self-sufficiency in food production for an
increasing population, and cotton for the textile industry and for export. A
major inflow of capital and technical resources will be required, and the Bank
can fulfill an important task by contributing towards priority invedtments,
and by providing encouragement and unbiased counsel.
1.13      The Bank can have a major impact on the planning process through
the provision of unbiased counsel. As an example, an agricultural pricing
policy that provided positive incentives would probably have more impact than
any other measure to increase production. The analysis provided on pricing
policy in the forthcoming Basic Economic Report should be helpful to the
Syrian planners in highlighting the shortcomings of the existing system and
proposing adjustments. Finally through project implementation the Bank can
encourage the institution building process.
1.14      The Bank has financed three projects in the agricultural sector, the
Balikh Irrigation and Rural Development Project (Loan No. 975-SYR, Credit No.
469-SYR) which became effective in September 1974, the First Livestock Devel-
opment Project (Loan No. 1311-SYR, 1312T-SYR), which became effective in March
1978, and a cotton seed processing project (Loan No. 1631-SYR) was signed on
December 13, 1978.. The progress in the Balikh Project is discussed in para
1.19. The Livestock Project should contribute towards increasing total live-
stock production (mostly sheep) and in reducing annual fluctuations in animal
numbers in the semi-arid parts of the country. The cotton seed processing
project will increase vegetable oil production by 15,000 tons per year. It is
not yet effective pending recruitment of consultants.
1.15      The drainage project proposed in this report addresses itself
directly to two of the key issues discussed above. By providing drainage for
the Lower Euphrates Valley it would protect an existing productive irrigated
area with trained farmers and a developed infrastructure from further salini-
zation and risk of abandonment, at a fraction of the cost of developing new
irrigation land. The principal crops grown in the Project area, wheat, sugar
beet, and cotton are the three most important crops at the national level in
relation to potential import substitution and to exports. The Project includes
an agricultural extension and research component, which is considered vital in
pointing the Syrian Government towards lower cost, rapid gestation, production
oriented investment. The Project would also have an impact on institution
building through its technical assistance component. Projects in the ongoing
pipeline all of which already fall within the agricultural strategy above,
include agricultural development in the rainfed areas, irrigation rehabilita-
tion in the Lower Euphrates Valley and small irrigation development in the
North East of Syria.



C. Role of Irrigation and Drainage
Government Policy for Irrigation
1.16      For two decades it has been Government's policy to reduce the
dependence of the country on rainfed agriculture by increasing the irrigated
area and reducing the area planted in zones of low probability rainfall.
During the second Five-Year Plan (1966-1970), there was an increase in
emphasis towards development of the Euphrates Basin, accompanied by the
establishment of the Ministry of the Euphrates Dam in 1969. In the third
Five-Year Plan (1971-1975), more than 75% of the total public sector invest-
ment for the Plan period, was directed towards irrigation development of the
Euphrates Basin, where the main potential for increasing the area under
irrigation in Syria lies.
The Euphrates Basin
1.17      Rapid development by the private sector of the Euphrates Basin in
Syria took place from 1950 to 1960 when as a result of the high price of cot-
ton, motorized pumps were used to develop most of the area suitable for low
lift gravity irrigation for cotton production. But since 1960 farmers have
started to abandon some of this land due to lack of drainage and spread of
salinity. Development by the public sector began in 1968 with the construc-
tion of a dam and power plant on the Euphrates River at Thawra (Tabqa Dam).
Filling of the 12 billion m3 reservoir, called Lake Assad, took place in
1974-75.
1.18      In the early 1970s, the Government gave priority to development in
the Balikh Basin region. Construction of a pilot project covering about
19,600 ha was completed in 1974. By 1975 the irrigated area in the Euphrates
Basin had grown to about 145,000 ha as shown below:

1.19      The Bank has financed the Balikh Irrigation and Rural Development
Project on 41,000 ha adjacent to the Balikh Pilot Project, despite delays in
the appointment of consultants and procurement problems, works are now pro-
gressing with some difficulty on the first 10,000 ha section. However,
the remainder of the project has been postponed to review the technique of
lining canals in gypsiferous soils, and the extent of affected soils. Other
projects for the development of lands located between Aleppo and the dam on
the plateau dominating Lake Assad are under construction and being planned
but irrigation of these lands requires a high pumping lift. By 1980 the
irrigated area in the Euphrates Basin will only have increased to about
165,000 ha (Table 1.2), considerably less than planned largely due to (i) the
technical problems of constructing canals through gypsiferous soils, (ii)
Government failure to take into account the normal problems of bringing any
large new area of land into irrigation, and (iii) an estimated 10,000 ha of
privately developed irrigation being abandoned because of salinity.
Issues in the Development of Irrigated Agriculture
1.20      High Cost of New Irrigation.  Due to the variability of rainfall in
Syria and the resulting unreliability of rainfed production, the main scope
for obtaining self-sufficiency in production is through increasing production
on irrigated lands. Syria is comparatively fortunate among countries in the
EMENA region in having the long term potential to increase the irrigated area
from about 550,000 ha in 1980 to nearly 1 million hectares in the future. Most
of this potential lies in the Euphrates Basin, utilizing storage already avail-
able in Lake Assad. Unfortunately, construction costs increased rapidly in
Syria during the period 1970-75, and the cost of constructing new irrigation



works is now of the order of US$5,000 per hectare, before taking into account
the agricultural costs of farm development. Accordingly, at the present time
it is hardly economic to equip and bring into irrigation new land that is
completely undeveloped unless an exceptionally high level of agricultural
production may be anticipated.
1.21      Exploitation of Newly Irrigated Lands.  Government has not yet
decided the type of exploitation to be carried out on newly irrigated land.
The Balikh Pilot Project was developed as a State Farm when State farms were
favored as a form of exploitation but because the agricultural performance
has been disappointing, and the costs of providing scarce management (farm
managers and foremen) and skilled labor (tractor drivers and mechanics) is
great, Government is reconsidering whether to return to the system of distri-
buting land to individual small farmers and cooperatives as was successfully
carried out under the agrarian reform program in the 1960s. Long delays in
deciding this issue are restricting progress in irrigation development.
Rehabilitation of the abandoned land in the Lower Euphrates Valley has not
been included in the Project proposed in this report mainly for this reason.
1.22      On-farm Development.  There is scope for increasing yields on the
half million hectares of irrigated land that already exist in Syria, through
intensification of production and increase of yields. Government has rightly
emphasized the importance of increasing production in the rainfed areas, but
it has not fully recognized that there is even more scope for large produc-
tion increases from the existing irrigation areas, where the assured supply
of water reduces the risks associated with the increased use of purchased
farm inputs. There is need to increase farm credit and input use, and to
improve farm practices, but little response can be expected from the farmers
until Government improves price incentives (para. 1.08) and provides a sound
technological package through research and trials (para. 1.10).
1.23      Protection and Rehabilitation.  In several parts of Syria, serious
drainage problems have developed some years after the installation of irri-
gation facilities, including the Ghab region on the Orontes River and the
Middle and Lower Euphrates Valley. The Government is now aware of the low
cost of providing drainage to safeguard existing productive irrigated areas.
However, more emphasis needs to be placed on the relatively low cost of
reclaiming the recently abandoned but partly equipped alluvial soils compared
with the cost of developing new land.
Government's Review of Irrigation and Drainage Development Strategy
1.24      The Syrian Government is now reconsidering its irrigation develop-
ment strategy, and before authorizing expenditures on any new projects it is
evaluating the expected results and viability of those projects which are
already under implementation such as the Bank financed Section I of the Balikh
Irrigation Project. As an exception the Government has instructed the Ministry
of Euphrates Dam to go ahead with drainage of the Lower Euphrates Valley due
to the urgency of the situation and to the project's satisfactory economic
viability.



- 8-
Bank's Role in Irrigation and Drainage
1.25      The projects in the Bank's agricultural lending pipeline (para. 1.14)
include both rainfed and irrigated projects. Within the irrigation subsector,
the Lower Euphrates Drainage Project proposed in this report, and the subsequent
irrigation rehabilitation project in the Lower Euphrates Valley, would concen-
trate on making full use of the existing irrigation infrastructure, and on in-
creasing farm level production through agricultural research, extension and the
provision of inputs. The proposed irrigation development project in the North
East would provide low cost supplementary irrigation from groundwater, which
would increase farm incomes on an existing area of rainfed farming. The Bank
can continue to fulfill a key role on the ongoing Balikh Irrigation Project by
helping the Syrians overcome the technical problems of lining canals in gypsi-
ferous soils.
II. THE PROJECT AREA AND NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
A. The Project Area
2.01      Location.  The Lower Euphrates Valley, which is the Project area,
consists of several terraces extending either side of the Euphrates River
from Halabie to the Iraqi border, about 180 km downstream (see Map 13259).
The three main towns in the Valley are located on the right bank of the
Euphrates River; Deir-ez-Zor about 500 km northeast of Damascus, Meyadine
about 50 km downstream and Abu Kemal about 130 km downstream from Deir-ez-Zor.
2.02      Topography and Drainage.  The terraces are confined on both sides of
the river by gypsiferous cliffs of 2-20 m height on the left bank and 30 m to
80 m on the right bank, and consist of three main deposits totalling 173,600
ha: (i) current deposits of sands and gravels cover about 12,500 ha; (ii)
recent deposits forming a terrace of about 46,700 ha, 2-4 m above the average
river level and containing old river meander channels; 10,500 ha requiring
drainage; and (iii) sub-recent deposits covering approximately 114,400 ha
about 5-6 m above the river, and forming a slightly decreasing grade towards
the gypsiferous cliffs. They contain about 70,000 ha of poorly drained land
or about two thirds of the sub-recent terrace. Approximately 50% of the
recent and sub-recent deposits together would respond to drainage as proposed
in this Project. The terraces of the left bank are disected by the Khabour
River entering the Euphrates near Meyadine and the right bank is disected by
five Wadis entering the Euphrates between EIalabie and Abu Kemal.
2.03      Population.  Total population in the Mohafazat or Province of Deir-
ez-Zor is estimated at 364,000 (end of 1977) of which about 87,000 (24%)
constitute.the active labor force. Those engaged in agriculture are about
60,000 or 69% of the active labor force and are supplemented for seasonal
requirements by members of the extended family from outside the area. However,
as a result of poor drainage and the abandonment of land, the agricultural
population is decreasing by an estimated 4% annually and migrating to towns



and cities. Several entire villages have been abandoned since salinization of
land became serious. About 120,000 (33%) reside in the three main towns, of
whom 93,000 live in Deir-ez-Zor. The project area is crossed by nomadic popu-
lations driving their herds to the desert region south of the project area in
the winter and back to the highlands near the Turkish border in early summer.
2.04      About 40% of the population of the Mohafazat is illiterate.  The
state of health of the population is generally poor. Bilharzia is endemic to
the area and malaria is present. Government is pursuing an active Bilharzia
control program in the Euphrates Valley under guidance from the World Health
Organization.
2.05      Water Supply and Electricity.  Most urban areas have access to a
piped water supply. The villages in the Lower Valley are beginning to be sup-
plied with piped water in the area from Deir-ez-Zor to Meyadine on the right
bank. A 22 kV power line is under construction on the right bank between
Deir-ez-Zor and Abu Kemal. A 66 kV line connects Deir-ez-Zor to the Tabqa
hydro-electric plant. A 66 kV line from Deir-ez-Zor to Abu Kemal is planned
for completion at the end of 1979. On the left bank construction of a 22 kV
line is planned for 1979. Existing and planned power requirements on the right
bank would be sufficient for the Project, but higher voltage connections, which
have been included in the Project, would have to be constructed on the left
bank to supply the needs of the proposed Project (para. 3.11).
2.06      Communications.  Two primary roads traverse the length of the project
area, one on each side of the Euphrates River. They are connected by a bridge
at Deir-ez-Zor. The right bank road connects Aleppo, and hence Damascus, with
Baghdad. The direct road to Damascus via Palmyra will be upgraded as part of
a World Bank loan and will enable more rapid transport of produce from the
Project area to Damascus. Villages which are not on the primary roads are
generally connected by earth roads. A railway from Aleppo passes down the
plateau close to the left bank of the Euphrates to a point opposite Deir-ez-
Zor where it turns northeast to the Turkish border then east to Iraq. Deir-
ez-Zor receives a regular air service from Damascus.
B. Natural Resources
2.07      Climate.  The Lower Euphrates Valley has a dry continental climate,
hot in summer and cold in winter with occasional dust and sandstorms. Twenty
years data at Deir-ez-Zor, 203 m above sea level, indicates an average monthly
maximum of 40.30C in July and an average minimum temperature of 2.40C in
January.  Absolute maximum during the period was 47.80C in August and absolute
minimum was -8.2 0C in February. The average frost free period is 290 days,
suitable for a wide range of crops.  Annual precipitation at Deir-ez-Zor,
which occurs in the winter months, averages 171 mm. Average wind speeds reach
5.6 m/sec for July and average evaporation is 2,500 mm resulting in high water
consumption by crops and rapid formation of salinity when the water table is
near the surface. Climatic data is presented in the Project File.



- 10 -
2.08      Soils and Salinity.  Five soil surveys have been carried out by Gov-
ernment and various consultants and show that the soils developed on recent
alluvial deposits are brown coarse textured soils generally suitable for irri-
gation but with varying degrees of waterlogging (hydromorphic) and salinity
development depending on topographical position. Soils of the sub-recent
terrace however can be classed as seirozem or sodic soils with hydromorphic
features in lower lying areas and as such are less suitable for irrigation
than those soils of the recent terrace.
2.09      High salinity, brought about by inadequate drainage and leaching
under arid climatic conditions, is the major limiting factor to crop growth
on all soils of the sub-recent terrace except those at relatively high eleva-
tions near the river embankment. The following table shows the gross areas
of soils normally suitable for gravity irrigation, according to the degree of
salinization in the root zone. The survey was carried out at the end of 1975.

/1   The Consultants estimate that a further 6,280 ha gross would be suitable
for sprinkler irrigation.
Source: Consultants' main report (GERSAR-SCET) Feasibility Study Zone I -
July 1977.
This table shows that the situation is serious with about 10% of land suitable
for gravity irrigation physically abandoned due to salinity, 20% which is only
partially and irregularly cropped, and 33% which runs considerable risk .of
being abandoned under the present conditions.
2.10      Comparison of previous aerial photographs and surveys with photo-
graphy and surveys carried out recently show that 7,000 ha have been com-
pletely abandoned between 1963 and 1975. The cropped area seriously affected
by salinity which was ill defined in 1963 and where most crops grown are
uneconomic, covered 20% of the area in 1975. Evidence from aerial photographs



- 11 -
and field observations show that the rate of abandonment may have been increas-
ing in the last two years. As previously noted (para. 1.17), this situation
has been mainly brought about by an increase in irrigated cotton growing during
the 1950's which was not accompanied by the installation of a drainage system.
As a result, irrigation water and salt has accumulated in the soil profile.
The estimated present water and salt balance is shown diagramatically in Chart
18446. The Project is designed to provide a drainage system, lower the water
table and reduce the danger of further salinity.
2.11      About 20% of the soil profiles showed very high (greater than 32
mmhos conductivity) salinity in the root zone severely restricting or pro-
hibiting the growth of crops and 45% showed slight to low salinity (less than
8 mmhos). Most profiles showed low alkalinity or exchangeable sodium, how-
ever, about 20% could be considered moderately alkaline with average pH's of
9.0. The maximum pH values encounter of 9.4 are rare, so that extensive
rectification of alkalinity should not be necessary.
2.12      The permeability and transmissibility of soils on the recent and sub-
recent terraces are shown in Table 2.2. The surface soil or "loam" is suffi-
ciently permeable to readily permit leaching of salts. A gravel layer found
at an average of 8-10 meters below the surface in nearly all profiles studied
by GERSAR over the whole Project area, has good permeability and transmis-
sibility. The Consultants have proposed and the Bank agrees that instead of
using the more usual tile or open drains, the physical characteristics of the
soils indicate the aquifer can be used to transmit saline drainage waters to
the river by pumping from the aquifer using tubewells, thereby considerably
reducing the cost of drainage. Characteristics of the aquifer are such that
it can also transmit extra water added when leaching for rehabilitating saline
soils would commence in a future project.

2.13      In the surface soils, organic matter (average 0.7%) and available
phosphorous (15 ppm average) are normally low and even lower at depth indicat-
ing a need for the application of heavy rates of nitrogen and phosphorous
fertilizer for optimum crop growth. Potassium levels are satisfactory.
2.14      Water Resources.  The Euphrates River flows the length of the Project
area and has an average flow of 900 m3/second. At the present time, the flow
fluctuates according to the regulation of the 30 billion m3 Keban Dam in
Turkey and the 12 billion m3 Tabqa Dam in Syria. The reservoirs were filled
by 1976 and there is not yet a consistent pattern to the releases. The data
shown in the Project File for the period after completion of filling of the
two reservoirs indicates that the minimum flow entering Syria from Turkey does
not fall below 500 m3/sec. The quality of water is good, varying from 0.2 to
0.5 gram/liter total salts and can be used freely for reclamation and irriga-
tion purposes.
2.15      The unregulated Khabour River joins the Euphrates from the north
about half way between Deir-ez-Zor and Abu Kemal with an average flow of 80
m3/sec of good water quality.
2.16      A water table, mainly supplied by irrigation water, extends through
the upper soil and lower gravel layers. The water table is bounded below by
an impermeable marly-gypsiferous layer and gypsiferous escarpments to the
North and South. The Consultants observed the variation in levels of the
groundwater and found the high water period to be May-June reducing yields of
crops in peak period of growth and the low water period November-January. The
conductivity of the water varied from 2 mmhos/cm near the Euphrates River to
over 20 mmhos below the sub-recent terrace, the latter being quite unsatisfac-
tory for plant growth.
C. Irrigation and Drainage Systems
2.17      Irrigation.  Water is presently pumped from the River by about 5,000
diesel pumps of 20-60 hp each. They are generally grouped into 2-4 units dis-
charging into one main earth canal. Water is carried by main canals an average
of 3 km towards the escarpment. The canals are often in poor condition either
because of sand deposits or because of leaks and breaches and would generally
be unsuitable to carry amounts of water needed for leaching abandoned land. A
new conveyance system would be needed and is envisaged in a further project.
2.18      About half the pumps are owned by cooperatives which employ pump
attendants, repair and maintain pumps and canals, and collect water charges,
and half by private entrepreneurs who were largely responsible for the estab-
lishment of pumps on the Euphrates in the 1950's and 1960's. Most pumps are
old and have poor efficiency. Repairs are carried out locally although with
at least 60 different types the availability of spare parts becomes a problem.



- 13 -
2.19      Drainage.  No system has been constructed to cope with drainage
waters although technically there appears to be no difficulty to construct
either a tile or tubewell system.
D. Land Tenure and Farm Organization
2.20      Of the 121,600 ha (gross) suitable for gravity irrigation about 75%
is operated by the owner either privately or in a cooperative form, 15% is
leased, about 6-7% sharecropped and the remainder is government operated. The
average farm size is about 3.7 ha and 84% of farms are less than 5 hectares
(Table 2.3). Increasing salinity would therefore affect a large number of
small land holders already on low incomes.

2.21      The Agrarian Reform Law of 1958 and its subsequent amendments pro-
vided for a ceiling of 50 ha per family.  Under this law some 9,000 ha of land
had been acquired and distributed to farming families up to 1975. While only
about 2% of land boundaries in the Valley have been surveyed, each kinship
community knows the size and location of land owned by each member. Because
of relatively recent settlement, fragmentation is not severe.
2.22      About 50% of the farmers in the project area are organized into 150
service cooperatives, with an average of about 200 members each. The purpose
of the cooperatives is to assist farmers with less than 16 ha to obtain pro-
duction inputs and outlets. They play an active role in land preparation
(through their own tractors or hired tractors), maintenance and operation of
pump stations and main irrigation canals. The cooperatives are used as a
vehicle for credit disbursement through the Cooperative Agricultural Bank and
for ensuring that cropping patterns laid down by their Ministry of Agriculture
are followed by members. The farmers elect representatives to local, regional,
and national committees. Cooperatives are administratively a part of the
Farmers Union which is also concerned with the welfare of farm laborers. They
are assisted in technical matters by officers of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Agrarian Reform. The Project will encourage the development and improve-
ment of cooperatives and direct much of the extension effort towards this
group.



- 14 -
E. Agricultural Production
2.23      Land Use.  Of the 173,600 ha which constitute the geographical area
of the Lower Euphrates Valley, about 116,000 ha net is suitable for irrigation
and 110,300 ha net for gravity irrigation. Of the latter, 85,900 ha net were
under cultivation at the erd of 1975 almost all of which were irrigated by
traditional irrigation systems. The remaining 24,400 ha could be considered
abandoned due to high salinity levels; 10,500 ha was physically abandoned and
14,000 ha grew some poor crops in an irregular fashion mainly to maintain
ownership rights. These crops are invariably failures. The rate of abandon-
ment is estimated at over 2,000 ha/year and accelerating. Presently the
cropping pattern is basically a cotton-cereal system. The cropping inten-
sity which can be further intensified, is about 106%. Wheat and cotton each
occupy about 41% of the cultivated area; sesame occupies 6% of the area; vege-
tables and sugar beet each about 5%; barley 4% and pulses and fodder crops 2%.
2.24      About half the cropped area produces reasonable yields and is not
affected by salinity while about 40% experiences a moderate reduction in yield
and 10% a severe reduction in yields due to salinity. The overall yields can
be improved and average 2.0 t/ha for wheat and seed cotton, sesame averages
700 Kg/ha and fodder crops about 4,000 feed units per hectare. Sugar beet
yields about 23 t/ha, winter vegetables 10 t/ha and summer vegetables 15 t/ha.
Pulses yield about 800 kg/ha. Estimated areas under crops in 1980, and in the
future are given in Table 5.2 as well as yields and production for the same
period.
F. Livestock
2.25      The table below shows the estimated number of livestock in the Proj-
ect area in 1975 and the production of meat and milk in that same year.
Table 2.4: ESTIMATED LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS, 1975

Total                                 309,250  14,100  2,600
Additional livestock pass through the area during annual livestock migrations
from the Turkish border area to the desert south of the Project area. In dry
years these migration flocks, including camels, stay in the area and feed off
crop by-products.



- 15 -
2.26      Requirements of animal products in the Project area in 1990 are
expected to be twice the present production of meat and 4 to 5 times the pre-
sent production of milk. While fodder production and production of by-
products will increase under the Project, the Project will not specifically
address the problem of increasing livestock production. The work of the
extension service in this Project will have some effect but it will remain
for a future related irrigation and rehabilitation project to take action to
improve livestock.
G. Farm Inputs
2.27      Seeds, Fertilization and Pesticides.  Seeds are mainly supplied
through the Cotton Marketing Organization, the General Organization for Cereals
and Mills and some of the cooperatives. Seed for many crops such as cereals
and sesame are retained by the grower from the previous crop. In these cases
efforts to introduce new varieties are difficult. The use of pesticides is
constantly changing and varies from year to year from 30-100 t/year for the
Project area, depending on cotton area and conditions for pests. The Cotton
Marketing Organization monitors the disease situation with some success and
has organized area spraying campaigns, at times using aircraft. Farmers and
cooperatives are charged for the service. Some 30,000 tons of fertilizer
mainly nitrogenous, were applied in 1976, resulting in an average application
of about 330 kg fertilizer per hectare. About 75 kg N/ha and 30 kg/ha P205 is
applied to wheat, and 120 kg N/ha and 40 kg P205/ha to cotton; rates which
appear satisfactory for nitrogen but not for phosphorous when considering the
low soil level (para. 2.13).   Minor crops, especially vegetables, receive
fertilizer or more frequently they receive animal manure.
2.28      Farm Machinery.  The number of tractors in the area has almost
doubled since 1973 to an estimated total of 950 or about 90 ha of cultivated
irrigated land per tractor; approaching a reasonable figure for intensive pro-
duction. Tractors are used mainly for land preparation and transport haulage.
The remainder of the agricultural operations are not mechanized except for
threshing of cereal grains which is partly carried out by non-mobile threshers
and partly by hand or animal power. Tractor and pump maintenance is carried
out satisfactorily, but slowly, by local workshops.
H.  Agricultural Research and Extension
2.29      Agricultural Research.  Research is undertaken on a limited scale by
a number of organizations in the Lower Euphrates Valley. The Ministry of Agri-
culture and Agrarian Reform operates through their Department of Soil and
Department of Agricultural Research. The Department of Soils has five profes-
sionals carrying out soil and crop research on a small scale on part of the
3,300 ha Beni Tahleb farm located near Deir-ez-Zor. The Department operates



- 16 -
a soil laboratory in Deir-ez-Zor which has carried out useful work under guid-
ance of the Consultants GERSAR/SCET. The Department of Agriculture Research
has recently entered research in the Valley by establishing variety plots at
El Selu farm, 30 km east of Deir-ez-Zor. The work of the Ministry is being
reinforced by an FAO/UNDP project (SYR/72004/G/01/12) which is allocating
about US$1.3 million of UN funds and 220 man-months of professional assistance
over five years for research and extension on crops, mechanization and water
management. Location of staff and development of research in this project has
been slow. Minor work on the improvement of cotton production is also carried
out in the Valley by an agronomist of the Cotton Bureau.
2.30      The Arab Centre for agricultural research, funded by the Arab League,
has a regional center located at Douma, Damascus. In the Lower Euphrates
Valley, it has several projects in drainage and reclamation on the Beni Tahleb
farm and assists Ministry staff in obtaining varietal materials for testing.
Beni Tahleb farm has been used successfully for reclamation of 200 ha and
drainage investigations. Results have shown that reclamation of severely
saline soils can be achieved using as little as one leaching of 1.5 m of water
over a period of 15 to 40 days. Research work on varietal adaptation of crops,
however, has been insufficient to ensure maintenance of high yields in the
future. The Project would provide for consultants to improve this situation.
2.31      Extension and Training.  An Agricultural Secondary School, with a
three-year program is located across the River from Deir-ez-Zor. Most
graduates of the school are employed by the Government. The school is also
the site for a branch of the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of
Aleppo, which has already established a first year class.
2.32      The Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform controls a group of
extensionists, located in 14 offices in the Valley. A traditional extension
service designed to extend information to farmers has recently been reestab-
lished within the Ministry. Each office is staffed by an agronomy and a
veterinary assistant, each of whom would on the average, be available to
advise about 1,700 farmers over about 6,500 ha; ratios which are unsatisfac-
tory in intensively cropped areas. The link between research results and
advice to farmers would be improved by the proposed Project (paras 4.08 and
4.09).
I. National Institutions
2.33      The Ministry of the Euphrates Dam is char-ed with the overall devel-
opment of water and power resources in the Euphrate3 Basin. The Ministry has
a relatively small staff in Damascus which makes ,- 'icy decisions and provides
coordination for its two large semi-autonomous oper- .ional agencies, the
General Administration for the Development of the Euphrates Basin (GADEB) and
the General Organization for the Euphrates Dam (GOED). Whereas GADEB is
responsible for all aspects of the development of irrigation and drainage
in the Euphrates Basin in Syria, GOED is mainly a construction enterprise



- 17 -
responsible for the construction and maintenance of the Tabqa dam and asso-
ciated hydro-electric power developments.
2.34      GADEB, which was established in 1968, has four main operational
"sectors": Irrigation, Agriculture, Social Affairs, and Finance and Adminis-
tration; it maintains separate offices for Planning and Statistics, Land
Acquisition, Public Relations and Procurement. GADEB is headed by a Director
General, and the four operating sectors are headed by deputy directors general.
The Headquarters of GADEB is at Tabqa, but the main offices and staff accom-
modation are located at Raqqa, where most of the operational staff work.
GADEB has also established an office in the project area at Deir-ez-Zor, 120
km east of Raqqa under the responsibility of the Deputy Director General
of Irrigation. At present the Deir-ez-Zor office is headed by an irrigation
engineer who is responsible for five professionals consisting of 3 hydro-
geologists, one agriculturalist and a sociologist, ten surveyors, and about
20 ancillary staff including drivers for six vehicles. The office has the
backing and services of the Raqqa office but is able to increase both ancil-
lary and professional staff at short notice to cope with further projects.
It would be capable of handling the engineering component of the Project.
Although GADEB has authority for the agricultural aspects of projects in the
Euphrates Valley during the construction period, it will not handle the
agricultural aspects of the proposed Drainage Project until the subsequent
irrigation rehabilitation phase, when a comprehensive agricultural extension
service will be established similar to that which now operates in the Middle
Euphrates.
2.35      At the end of 1976 some 76 engineers and 8 geologists were employed
by the Irrigation Sector, which would be mainly concerned with the design,
construction and maintenance of the Project.
2.36      The Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform has a large regional
centre at Deir-ez-Zor to serve the Deir-ez-Zor Mohafazat. The center is
staffed by 56 graduates, 63 technicians and about 120 ancillary staff. The
main departments are: Administration, State Property including the running
of state farms, Agricultural Affairs providing technical expertise and agri-
cultural extension, Animal Husbandry, Veterinary Health, Rural Engineering,
Research, Cotton, Rehabilitation and Training, Forestry and Statistics and
Planning. Sub-regional offices are located at Deir--ez-Zor with eight district
offices, Meyadine with two and Abu Kemal with two district offices. Although
insufficient staff is working on research and extension it is not difficult
to obtain extra staff. However, further training and reorganization is
necessary to improve the effectiveness of the organization.
2.37      The Cooperative Agricultural Bank has a pivotal role in agricultural
production being the sole institutional source of farm credit, and it is also
responsible for the physical supply of farm inputs. More than two thirds of
the credit advanced is for seasonal loans, of which nearly half is provided
in kind. The Cooperative Bank has an active policy of encouraging coopera-
tives by charging differential interest rates (4.0% to cooperatives; 5.5% to
individual farmers) and by granting to cooperatives a 5% reduction in the
purchase price of farm inputs in addition to supplying credit. Loan recovery
is over 95%.



- 18 -
2.38      In the Project area, there are four branches of the Bank, at Deir-
ez-Zor, Meyadine, Abu Kemal and Buseira. During the period 1972 to 1977 the
total volume of agricultural lending increased from about SL 30 million in
1972 to nearly SL 40 million in 1975 but since then has declined to about
SL 30 million in 1977. Seasonal credit accounted for about 90% of the total
in all years, and of this over 85% was advanced for the cotton crop. At
present, about half of the total amount is lent to cooperatives with the
remainder to individual farmers. Average loans in 1977 amounted to SL 90,000
for cooperatives and SL 7,000 for individual farmers. Lending is expected to
stabilize or slightly increase under the Project.
2.39      Agricultural Marketing.  State controlled monopolies carry out the
marketing of most agricultural commodities. A free market exists only for the
more perishable products: fruits, vegetables, milk, meat, and poultry.
2.40      The most important agricultural commodity by value in the project
area is cotton. It is marketed through the Cotton Marketing Organization
(CMO) which has responsibility for purchasing seed cotton from the farmers
at a price that is fixed annually before planting. CMO operates a modern saw
ginnery in Deir-ez-Zor which has an 80,000 ton annual capacity, just suffi-
cient for the production of the Mohafazat. However, in recent years, no more
than 50,000-60,000 tons have been created due to shortage of electricity, but
this is expected to be remedied during 1979 when Deir-ez-Zor is connected to
the national grid. The remaining 20,000-30,000 tons have been transported
by truck to ginneries at Aleppo. A cotton seed oil processing factory is to
be constructed by the General Organization for Food Industry and the Govern-
ment has recently signed a loan with the Bank (para 1.14).
2.41      Marketing for wheat and barley, the main winter crops, and lentils
are the responsibility of the General Organization for Cereals and Mills
(GOCM), including imports, domestic purchases, marketing and inter-regional
trade. In the Project area, there are several purchasing stations where
cereals and lentils are purchased by GOCM at prices fixed at the beginning
of each season. However, most of the 100,000 ton annual production of wheat
in the Lower Euphrates Valley is consumed by farm families or marketed locally.
Only a few thousand tons are sold to GOCM.
2.42      The Sugar Board, which is responsible for sugar marketing and pro-
cessing, is constructing one of the four new factories at Deir-Ez-Zor as part
of the Government's policy of self-sufficiency in sugar. It is planned to be
in commission by 1979.
2.43      In the area of Meyadine and Aswara, on the right bank, farmers have
specialized in vegetable production. A factory to process tomatoes and
eight kinds of vegetables is now being constructed, with a capacity of 150
tons tomatoes per day. It is expected to operate 60 days per year.
2.44      If salinization continues considerable surplus capacity will develop
in the agricultural processing facilities in the Lower Euphrates Valley. The
proposed Project would contribute to maintaining capacity and economic viabil-
ity of these processing plants.



- 19 -
J. Conclusions
2.45      The area has a large established farming community producing about
US$36 million annually of agricultural produce on potentially good soils, with
transport retail and repair services, educational and health services and
national agricultural credit and marketing institutions serving their needs.
Much of this structure is in jeopardy if salinization of land through lack of
a drainage system is allowed to continue.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Overall Project Concept
3.01      As a result of the devastation caused by the progressive saliniza-
tion of the Lower Euphrates Valley, the Syrian Government appointed consultants,
financed partly by the Bank in the Balikh Irrigation Project, to examine the
problem and make proposals for its resolution. A comprehensive program for
drainage, irrigation rehabilitation and land reclamation has now been prepared
(para. 3.17) comprising three main elements:
(a)  Drainage to arrest the spread of salinity.
(b)  Agricultural extension and research to increase farm production.
(c)  Provision of a new irrigation system, and additional drainage to
bring back into production approximately one third of the irri-
gated area of the Valley that has been abandoned and to rehab-
ilitate the existing irrigation system.
The Government accepts and fully supports this strategy of which the proposed
Project will be (a) and (b) above.
3.02      The first main task will be to halt the process of salinization,
by the provision of drainage to lower the level of the groundwater. The
geological structure of the Valley consists of a gravel layer underlying fine
alluvial deposits (para. 2.12). All pumping carried out in the gravel layers
produced perceptible drawdowns in the fine deposits which confirmed the
suitability of the method. This tubewell drainage 1/ technique was compared
both technically and economically, to the more common subsurface pipe field
drainage methods and open drains excavated in the gravel layer and found
to be less costly and more effective except on the lower recent terrace,
bordering the Euphrates River, which will be drained by open drains.
1/   Termed "large scale drainage" technique by the Consultants GERSAR-SCET.



- 20 -
3.03      Because of the complexity of the factors involved in the behavior
of the aquifer when subject to pumping through tubewells the Consultants used
a calibrated mathematical model to:
(a)  estimate the amount of water to be removed from the aquifer to
halt the land deterioration;
(b)  estimate the amount of water to be removed under a given irri-
gation and leaching regimen; and
(c)  optimize the number of wells and their location.
The tubewell drainage scheme formulated as a result of these studies provides
the basis for the proposed Lower Euphrates Drainage Project.
3.04      The second main tasks will be to increase agricultural production
on the land presently under cultivation, and to develop and publicize the farm
level technology needed to obtain the full benefits from the subsequent recla-
mation phase. An early start to agricultural research and extension is called
for due to the long lead time needed to test crop varieties and fertilizer
treatments. These activities have therefore been included in the proposed
Project. Some increases in yields would be obtained during the initial drain-
age phase from these research and extension efforts.
3.05      The third major component of the development strategy for the Valley
will be the irrigation rehabilitation and land reclamation phase. Experi-
mental work carried out at the Beni Tahleb research farm indicates that recla-
mation can be carried out quite simply through leaching for short periods with
irrigation water (para. 2.30). The pumping capacity of the existing privately
constructed irrigation system will be insufficient for this work, and the
distribution systems in the abandoned area have fallen into disrepair. How-
ever, it is anticipated that farmers in the Project Area will successfully
carry out some leaching of the moderately saline areas using their existing
irrigation system. The Consultants have therefore proposed although GADEB
has not yet agreed to install a new pump and buried pipe "California" hydrant
system, distributing water to village units of about 2,000 ha each as at
present. The saline and abandoned land will be reclaimed and the non-saline
areas will benefit from a much improved distribution system. Additional
tubewell drainage will become necessary during this stage. The subsequent
reclamation phase could commence soon after the completion of the initial
drainage and as soon as a Government decision has been taken concerning the
type of exploitation to be adopted for the abandoned areas, either private
farms, or cooperatives or State Farms. Completion of this phase will take
about 12 years. Even if the irrigation rehabilitation and land reclamation
phase were delayed or cancelled, the first and second phases which comprise
the proposed Project will be economically justified.
3.06      The Project area is divided into three zones, subdivided into eight
sectors each of which is also a separate hydrogeological unit: Zone 1 (Sectors
3, 5 and 7 - 55,600 ha gross suitable for gravity irrigation) on the right bank
downstream of Deir-ez-Zor; and Zone 2 (Sectors 6 and 8 - 36,000 ha) on the left
bank downstream of the Khabour river; and Zone 3 (Sectors 1, 2, and 4 - 29,400



- 21 -
ha) upstream of Deir-ez-Zor on the right bank and of the Khabour river on the
left bank (IBRD Map 13259).
B. Project Description
3.07      The Project will provide about:
(a) 170 tubewells with electric pumps and associated equipment;
(b) 450 km of open drains to return saline drainage water to the
Euphrates River, to intercept surface water from adjacent
areas and to collect surface water from the Project area;
(c)  200 km of access roads to the tubewell pumping stations;
(d)  240 km of 22 kV power transmission lines for the pumping
stations; and
(e) monitoring of salinity.
The Project will also provide for buildings and equipment for extension,
operation and maintenance services, and consultants to assist extension and
agricultural research. Consultants will also provide hydrological investiga-
tions and engineering design services. GADEB will be the executing agency for
the Project, of which the features are described below. Technical character-
istics are presented in Annex 2.
Detailed Features
3.08      The facilities provided in this first phase drainage project. will
follow the general pattern defined for the full development program. Surface
drains, access roads, and transmission lines will fit the limits of future
irrigation units (IBRD Map 13260).
3.09      Tubewells and Pumping Stations.  The Project will require a total
of 170 wells, 72 located in Zone 1 and 98 in Zones 2 and 3. The tubewells
will have a depth of about 20 m and 18 inches diameter. Fiberglass casing
and screen will be selected because these materials are not corroded by
highly saline waters and are less subject to encrustation than special alloy
metals. In addition, they can be acidized without harm to remove encrusta-
tion. A graded gravel pack will be placed around the screens where they
penetrate the aquifer. Pumping equipment will be standardized and designed
for delivery of a constant flow. Standard design values of 30, 35, 45 and
50 liters/sec will be adopted. Pumps will be vertical lineshaft impellers.
These have been selected in preference to submerged vertical electro-pumps in
which the pump and motor are submerged and are more difficult to maintain and
subject to wear by the sand content of the water pumped. The pump impellers
will be in bronze stainless steel which are more resistant to abrasion and
corrosion. Protection will be included for the pumps and motors against dry



- 22 -
running. Power supply at 22 kV, protected by a circuit breaker, will be pro-
vided at each well where a stepdown transformer will be located. The rated
power of the transformer will be 25 kVA for all wells.
Surface Drains
3.10      The pumps will discharge into surface drains.  These drains will be
connected to larger drains intercepting overland flow from adjacent higher
areas during storm periods. A total of 450 km of surface drains will collect
drainage water over the Project area. The drainage discharges were calculated
(i) on the basis of a specific runoff from adjacent areas of 1.0 1/sec/ha cor-
responding to a one in 10-year rainfall; and (ii) on the assumption, that under
the conditions of layout and management of the future irrigation system, 25%
of the water will be lost and will discharge directly into the drainage
system. Provision will be made for reducing leakage from the drains by soil
compaction and for their lining where they cross areas of gravel outcrops.
Structures will include roadway crossings and flap gates at the river to
prevent back-up into the drainage system during flood periods.
Power Supply
3.11      Power supply to the tubewells will be provided by a total of 240 km
of 22 kV lines, which tap the 22 kV main power lines already existing or under
construction on the right bank, and those to be built in 1979 on the left bank.
The power requirements for the tubewells will be about 675 kW for zone l and
740 kW for zones 2 and 3. Provision will also be made in the Project for 66
kV connections from the planned 66 kV right bank line to provide adequate
power for the left bank.
Access Roads
3.12      Inspection roads will be constructed within the Project area to
link tubewells to the existing main roads running along each bank. Roads
will be surfaced with gravel on a compacted soil base. Two standard widths
are foreseen; a surface width of 6 m for primary roads and 4 m for secondary
roads. Total lengths of access roads would be 200 km.
Buildings and Other Facilities
3.13      Offices and warehouses will be built at the Project headquarters
in Deir-ez-Zor, and at the eight sector headquarters. These facilities will
subsequently be used by agricultural extension staff and operation and main-
tenance personnel. Office furniture, equipment and vehicles will be pro-
vided under the Project. Operation and maintenance equipment will include
two graders, two excavators, one front loader, four trucks and vehicles. A
central workshop for repairing tubewell equipment will be built in Deir-ez-
Zor.
Monitoring
3.14      The Project will include the establishment and initial operation of
a unit to monitor salinity, land use and production in the lower Euphrates



- 23 -
Valley. Regular monitoring of the salinity of irrigation water and ground-
water, and of groundwater levels, and their relationship to crop yields will
be supplemented with the use of satellite photography and related ground
checking and calibration (ground truthing) for which assistance is to be
provided by a U.S.A assisted remote sensing project.
C. Project Risks
3.15      In order to reduce the risk of pumps not being able to lower the
water table to safe levels for growing crops, the Consultants, using the
mathematical model and assuming continuous pumping, calculated the number of
additional wells to compensate for downtime, maintenance periods, and possible
sampling errors in groundwater studies. The Bank Mission proposed a further
increase in the number of tubewells to decrease the risk of additional inflow
to the groundwater from return flow from drains and from irrigation canals.
On the basis of observations of unlined existing irrigation canals, the Con-
sultants assumed that the return flow from unlined surface drains to the
aquifer will also be negligible. Provision was included in the Project for
lining of surface drains only where the thickness of alluvial layer is less
than 4 meters. However, it was agreed to add additional wells to remove
return flow during the first years after construction and to protect against
breakdowns. It is expected that natural silting will reduce water losses
later on.
3.16      Accordingly the Bank proposed to increase the number of wells by 31
from 139 to 170 to reduce the risks of further salinization of the Project
area soils and the Euphrates River. The cost of providing this additional
security, which increased total costs by about 5%, has been included in the
Project costs. The revised number of wells to be included in the Project is
still considerably less than the total number of 426 l/ wells that will be
installed for the full irrigation rehabilitation and reclamation of the Lower
Euphrates Valley.
D. Status of Engineering
3.17       A comprehensive study resulting in an outline master plan for devel-
opment of the Lower Euphrates Valley was completed in July 1976 by GERSAR-
SCET. A full feasibility study for the rehabilitation of irrigation works
and reclamation of lands on the right bank downstream of Deir-ez-Zor (Zone 1),
was completed in July 1977 by the same firm. Groundwater pumping tests and
soil profile studies carried out during the comprehensive study indicated that
1/   Extrapolated from results of detailed calculations carried out from Zone
1 using a computer model with inputs related to irrigation and leaching
requirements.



- 24 -
the irrigation layout required and the salinization problems and their resolu-
tion are similar on both banks of the river, but further investigations are
required on the left banks to finalize the precise number and location of
wells to be installed.
E. Consulting Services
3.18      Zone 1.  The contract for engineering services between GADEB and
GERSAR-SCET provides for the detailed designs and preparation of tender docu-
ments for the construction of irrigation and drainage works for Zone 1. The
same contract provides also for the preparation of construction drawings.
GADEB instructed the Consultants to commence this work on January 1, 1978.
Tender documents for drilling and electromechanical equipment were ready
in December 1978, and will be complete for civil works and electrical connec-
tions by April 1979. The foreign exchange cost of these studies will be
eligible for reimbursement under the ongoing Bank financed Balikh Irrigation
Project. Consultants will be appointed under terms of conditions satisfactory
to the Bank to assist in evaluating bids for tubewells and associated equipment
and to supervise construction and installation of the Project.
3.19      Zones 2 and 3.  Consultants will be employed in order to carry out
additional soils and hydrogeological investigations, in Zones 2 and 3, to be
followed by detailed design and preparation of tender documents for drainage
works, evaluation of tubewell bids and supervision of construction. These
consultants' services for Zones 2 and 3 will be included as a component of the
Project. The results of the additional soils and hydrogeological investiga-
tions will be submitted to the Bank for comment before commencement of the
drainage works in these two zones.
3.20      Consultants will be included in the Project to assist Government in
strengthening existing agricultural research activities with respect to major
crops, and in agricultural extension services to farmers at the village level
in basic crop growing techniques, animal husbandry and drainage practices.
Six man years of specialist assistance have therefore been included in the
Project costs, three man years for research and three for extension (paras
4.08 and 4.09). Consultants for this purpose will be appointed under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. They will establish cooperation with
the FAO/UNDP integrated Agricultural Development project already underway in
the Project area (para. 2.29) which is likely to be extended into a second
phase. In this case it would be preferable if the research and training
specialists were to be incorporated into and financed from the UNDP Project
rather than included in the Bank Project. However, since some uncertainty
remains, the cost of these experts has been included in the Project on the
understanding that disbursements will cease if alternative financing for this
component subsequently becomes available. At negotiations, Government assur-
ances were obtained that the Bank would be informed if such alternative
finance becomes available.



- 25 -
F. Implementation Schedule
3.21      The Project will be implemented over four years, from mid-1979
through December 1982 (Figure 3.1). Construction of project works will begin
at the end of 1979 and be completed by December 1982. Work will start on the
contract for tubewell drilling and pumping equipment for Zone 1. Work on
surface drains will start four months later because of the time required to
complete topographic surveys and detailed designs. Work on Zone 2 is planned
to start early 1981 and Zone 3 in the last quarter of 1981. Buildings and
other facilities will be constructed in accordance with the requirements for
maintenance and resarch services.
G. Cost Estimates
3.22      The total project cost is estimated at SL 207.4 million (US$52.5
million), including physical and price contingencies. Cost estimates for
civil works and equipment are based on unit rates obtained in contracts during
1977 for similar works in Syria and Eastern Mediterranean countries. Physical
contingencies included in project estimates are 15% for civil works and 10%
for equipment for Zone 1. Relevant contingencies for Zones 2 and 3 where
less precise information is available are 25% and 15% respectively. A special
allowance is provided for improving the impermeability of surface drains where
they cross outcropping gravel areas. For all civil works, price contingencies
have been compounded at annual rates of 9% for 1978-1979 and 8% in 1980 through
1982. For equipment, the corresponding rates are 7.5% in 1978-1979 and 7% in
1980 through 1982. The rapid increase in construction costs in Syria during
the period 1973-1975, which partly contributed to severe cost overruns on
the Balikh Irrigation Project, have recently moderated in response to Govern-
ment policy. Rates of inflation for local civil works are therefore expected
to be similar to international rates. A special price contingency of 7% has
been added to base cost and physical contingencies to take into account the
difference between the estimated and the actual cost increases that took place
during 1978. The estimated foreign exchange component of the project, includ-
ing contingencies of SL 40.7 million (US$10.3 million), is estimated at SL
116.6 million (US$29.5 million) or about 56% of total project cost. The for-
eign exchange estimate assumes that foreign contractors will win contracts
for constructing tubewells and for furnishing the associated equipment, and
that Syrian contractors will win civil works contracts. Details of the
cost estimate are given in Annex 1, Table 2, and are summarized in Table 3.1.

H. Financing
3.23      The proposed Bank loan of US$30 million to the Government of Syria
would finance the whole of the foreign exchange cost of the Project. Local
currency expenditures would be financed by the Government of Syria. The
financing plan would be as follows:
Table 3.2: PROJECT FINANCING
SL Million    US$ Million   Percentage
World Bank Loan                           118.5            30.0           57
Government                                 88.9            22.5           43

3.24      The Bank loan will cover 57% of the total Project cost.  The term
of the proposed loan will be 17 years and the grace period 4 years based on
country grounds.
I. Procurement, Disbursement and Audit
Procurement
3.25      Construction of civil works and furnishing of equipment for the
drainage system will be divided into the following eight contracts:
(a)  two contracts for tubewells and electromechanical equipment
for Zone 1, and for Zones 2 and 3 together totalling SL 30.0
million (US$7.6 million);
(b)  three contracts for surface drains and access roads for each
zone totalling SL 89.5 million (US$22.7 million); and
(c)  three contracts for acquisition and installation of power trans-
mission lines and related civil works for each zone amounting to
SL 17.5 million (US$4.4 million).
The total estimated value of these contracts including physical and price
contingencies is SL 137.0 million (US$34.7 million).
3.26      These contracts would be tendered under international competitive
bidding according to the Bank's guidelines. From the experience gained in
bidding for the Balikh Project, it is likely that civil works contracts will



- 29
be won by Syrian nationalized companies. During loan negotiations the Gov-
ernment agreed that for state-owned companies, to qualify for bidding, the
Government will, for the purpose of the project, waive the supervision exemp-
tion clause in their charter.
3.27      Construction of administrative buildings, stores  and shops will
be let in small contracts after local competitive bidding following normal
Government procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank.
3.28      Equipment and vehicles for supervision, and operation and mainte-
nance, estimated to cost a total of SL 5.7 million (US$1.4 million), will
be procured after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines, except for purchases not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent where
procurement will be in accordance with the normal procurement procedures
of GADEB. All civil works and equipment will be procured in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines for procurement dated March 1977.
Disbursement
3.29      The proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million will be disbursed over
four years, 1979-1982. The loan will finance:
(a)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of the contract for drilling
and equipping tubewells and the contracts for transmission
lines;
(b)  45% of the cost of civil works contract representing the esti-
mated foreign exchange component;
(c)  100% of the foreign exchange of imported equipment, and 70% of
the cost of locally purchased goods; and
(d)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of consultant services.
3.30      Any savings in project costs will be cancelled.  Estimated schedules
of expenditures, disbursements and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of
the loan are presented in Annex 1.
Auditing of Accounts
3.31      Government departments and agencies maintain budgets and accounts
which are subject to audit by the Auditor General. Separate accounts will
be kept for the Project by GADEB; certified and satisfactory audited annual
financial statements pertaining to the project, including a review by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank Group, will be forwarded to
the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year.

J. Environment and Health
3.32      The Project will affect the environment by:
(a)  Construction of power lines and installation of pumps and
drainage canals. The area taken up by both lines and pumps
is minor and will not disturb existing known structures. The
area occupied by collector canals would be about 0.2% of the
total area and would not disturb known archeological sites.
(b)  Lowering the water table resulting in a reduction of stagnant
water in ponds. This should reduce the incidence of malaria
present in the region. Because of the dense human population
in the Project area, the ponds have not provided a habitat for
significant numbers of wild life.
(c)  Pumping drainage water into the Euphrates River.  The level
of salinity would be increased by a maximum of 0.2 gram/liter
and is not expected to affect water for either irrigation or
human consumption. As surface waters would be drawn down
through the soil profile before discharge, the content of
harmful organisms in-the Euphrates River as a result of
pumping should not increase.
(d)  Government maintains an active Bilharzia control program
under direct guidance from a World Health Organization
specialist. Because of this additional measures would
not be necessary under the Project.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The General Administration for the Development of the Euphrates
Basin (GADEB) will be responsible for engineering aspects of the project.
Agricultural Services for the Project will be the responsibility of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform.
A. Engineering
Engineering Construction
4.02      Up tc tie present GADEB has been largely involved in planning and
supervising construction of irrigation facilities and resettlement villages in
the 19,600 ha pilot project in the Balikh Basin, and in planning and organiz-
ing future development activities in the Meskene and Bali h Basin. Although
experience in supervision of design and construction has been obtained in the
ongoing areas, the unusual design, construction, operation and management



- 31
problems of the tubewell drainage system to be constructed will demand the
expertise of specialists presently not available in Syria. Provision has been
made in the cost estimates for employment of consultants to provide such tech-
nical and managerial assistance.
4.03       Responsibility for design, construction and maintenance of the proj-
ect works will be with the Deputy Director General Irrigation of GADEB at
Raqqa. The office at Deir-ez-Zor would be in charge of day-to-day supervision
of the Project and the staff will be expanded as necessary by transferring
personnel from the main office at Raqqa. The consultants will be located at
Deir-ez-Zor but the overall control from the Director of Irrigation at Raqqa.
4.04      GADEB will make arrangements with the Establissement Public de
l'Electricite (EPE), which has overall responsibility for the entire electric
power sector in Syria, for the construction of any necessary 66 kV connections
included in the Project. GADEB will be responsible for the contracts for the
construction of the 22 kV lines for the Project.
Operation and Maintenance
4.05      The Operations and Maintenance Division of the Irrigation Sector of
GADEB will gradually take over operation and maintenance of drainage networks,
tubewells and pumping stations and buildings from the Irrigation Division as
project construction is completed.
4.06      An operation and maintenance branch for each Sector (para. 3.06)
will be set up, with each branch being responsible for operation and normal
maintenance within its boundaries.  Coordination of operation will be through
an operational headquarters established at Deir-ez-Zor. A central workshop
and special plan for maintenance of pumps and motors will also be located at
Deir-ez-Zor as well as centralized unit equipped for maintaining and replacing
tubewell parts.
B. Agricultural Research, Extension and Training
4.07      While GADEB has the overall legal responsibility for the development
of Agricultural Services during project construction, it has only gained agri-
cultural experience from the previously sparsely populated Balikh pilot project
area, where the existing farmers were incorporated into newly irrigated State
Farms. In the Lower Euphrates Valley on the other hand, the Ministry of Agri-
culture is already well established and provides research, extension and
training as described in paras. 2.29-3.32. The respective roles that GADEB
and the Ministry of Agriculture will have in the Project area are that the
Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for the provision of Research and
Extension Services during ronstruction. They already have a large organiza-
tion, are the counterpart organization for the UNDP Project, and are technical
advisors for the cooperative groups. However, during the subsequent irrigation
rehabilitation phase GADEB will take over responsibility for agricultural



- 32 -
extension and research at the time that land is redistributed following the
appropriation of land required for construction of canals and other irrigation
works.
Research
4.08      A substantial effort must be made to improve research and extension
to obtain full benefits from the Project, and an early start is required if
reasonable benefits are to be obtained from the subsequent irrigation rehabil-
itation and development phase. Research needs to be carried out on the two
major crops in the area, wheat and cotton, and also on sugar beet the area of
which is to be expanded to supply the new sugar beet factory due for completion
in 1980. The production of all three crops can be improved by routine, but
intense work is needed on variety and fertilizer trials, and in the case of
sugar beet, on time-of-planting (spring and autumn). An adequate number of
Syrian research staff is already available in Syria, on the Beni Tahleb farm
and elsewhere, who will be assisted by the research consultant to be provided
under the Project (para 3.20).
Agricultural Extension
4.09      Many basic techniques in crop growing and animal husbandry can be
passed on to farmers while waiting for research results from the Project. In
addition farmers will have to be educated in the purpose and effect of the
drainage tubewells, and the associated collector canals. The present exten-
sion service, which will be increased at the village level, will have the
specific objectives of informing the farming population of the aims, methods,
and benefits of the Project, assisting farmers in using the present irriga-
tion system for leaching of saline lands and modifying the cropping pattern
to increase intensity of cropping and preparing the way for the irrigation
phase of development. They will have contact with cooperative officials and
work through this group wherever possible. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Government would keep the extension service operating
in the Project area adequately organized and staffed. The Project will
provide for a consultant for three years, who will assist in establishing
training courses for extensionists and supervisors and provide in-service
training for University graduates.
C. Monitoring and Reports
Monitoring
4.10      The effectiveness of the Project in terms of maintaining a low water
table and preventing an increase of abandoned or saline land, increasing yields
of crops, will be checked by a small monitoring group located at Deir-ez-Zor.
In addition the group would check the salinity levels in the Euphrates River
upstream and downstream of the Project area to determine the effect of the
Project. The group will consist of a drainage-soils specialist and a crops



- 33 -
specialist each with an assistant and a vehicle, and will be responsible to
the Assistant Director General, GADEB.
4.11      Soil and water samples will be taken from specific sites, at regular
intervals and analyzed for salinity in the Ministry of Agriculture Laboratory
at Deir-ez-Zor. Yields, crop patterns and salinity levels will be recorded
from a number of carefully selected fields located on several transects from
the river to the gypsiferous cliffs on both banks. The group will regularly
summarize the data, inform project management of the status and effectiveness
of the Project and recommend remedial action, if necessary.
4.12      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GADEB would form a
monitoring group organized to function according to the outline in paragraphs
4.10 and 4.11 and that in addition GADEB will continue to submit reports to
the Bank during the first five years after Project completion.
Completion Report
4.13      Not later than one year after completion of the Project, GADEB will
prepare and furnish to the Bank a report on the execution and initial opera-
tion of the Project, its cost, the benefits derived and to be derived from it,
the performance of GADEB and the Bank of their respective obligations under
the proposed loan agreement and the accomplishment of the purposes of the
proposed loan. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
D. Acquisition of Land
4.14      The Law establishing the Ministry of Euphrates Dam provides a legal
basis for compulsory purchase of land required for roads, canals, etc. The
Social Affairs Sector of GADEB is responsible for purchase of and compensa-
tion for land and property. Until such time as a compensation price is agreed
upon for the capital value of the land and paid by GADEB, compensation is paid
by GADEB for the value of crops that will be grown on the land acquired.
There has been trouble in acquiring land in the Middle Euphrates Valley where
a large surface irrigation and drainage scheme is being implemented by GADEB
on an area of 27,000 ha. However, the situation in the Middle Euphrates
Valley is different to that in the Project area, since in the former scheme
a considerable area of land is required for the large irrigation and drainage
canals, and some small farmers may lose a large proportion of their land. In
the Project area, however, there are no large irrigation or drainage canals to
be constructed, the total area of land to be acquired for the collector drains
will be small, and no individual farmer will be likely to lose more than a
small part of his land.
4.15      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that land needed for the
construction of Project works would be acquired as provided for in Syrian law
and that proper compensation would be paid to farmers whose land was acquired
in this way.

V. PRODUCTION, BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Project would not give rise to any large increases in agricul-
tural production, but it would prevent considerable losses in production that
would otherwise occur if no action is taken to prevent further salinitation
in the Lower Euphrates Valley. Project benefits have been calculated as the
difference between production without the Project and the production estimated
assuming the Project goes ahead as planned.
A. Land Affected by the Project
5.02      In considering the effects of salinization on yields over a 20-year
period, the Lower Euphrates Valley has been subdivided into four sub-categories
of land as shown in the table below:
Table 5.1: ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED NET AREAS OF NON-SALINE, SALINE
AND ABANDONED LAND POTENTIALLY SUITABLE FOR GRAVITY IRRIGATION

between 1975 and 1980.
/3   Total does not add due to rounding.
5.03      On the basis of the available evidence the rate of abandonment of
land is still increasing and without the Project would peak about 1980.
Thereafter the rate of abandonment would decrease until a stable situation
would be reached after about 20 years as shown in Figure 5.1. The figure also
indicates that about 70% of the decrease in cropped area would occur in the
first 10 years.

5.04      Without the Project the moderately and severely saline land would
become progressively more saline over the passage of time until finally
abandoned. As a result, the areas of moderately and severely saline land
would decrease over 20 years to about 2,000 ha each and the overall cropped
area would decrease by about 30,000 ha from 75,000 ha to 45,000 ha. The
Project would prevent the abandonment of this 30,000 ha and it is the produc-
tion on this area which would otherwise be lost, that would be the principal
source of quantifiable Project benefits. Some 41,200 ha (37%) out of the
total net area of 110,300 ha are non-saline and would not be affected even if
there were to be no project. These are the naturally well drained soils of
the recent terrace situated on both sides of the Euphrates River (para. 2.02).
5.05      Once the tubewell drainage system is installed, farmers would have
the possibility of carrying out leaching to rehabilitate some of their land.
It is estimated they would succeed in reducing salinity and improving yields
on about 2,600 ha (10%) of the moderately saline lands and 3,500 ha (40%) of
the severely saline lands resulting in a small increase in non-saline and
moderately saline lands, and a corresponding decrease in severely saline land.
It has been assumed that abandoned land will not be reclaimed in this Project
due to insufficient capacity and poor state of present irrigation canals.
B. Cropping Pattern, Yields, Production, Markets and Prices
Cropping Pattern and Yields
5.06      Cropping patterns and yields are summarized in Table 5.2.  Details
for the land in each salinity class are shown in the Project File. Without
the Project, the overall cropping pattern would become progressively more
similar to the pattern on the non-saline land as the area of moderately and
severely saline land remaining in cultivation would decrease and be progres-
sively abandoned, but the area of non-saline land would increase in proportion.
The cropping pattern within each salinity category would remain the same.
Thus, in the overall cropping pattern the proportion of cotton, which is
currently higher in the non-saline land, would increase. Conversely, the
proportion of wheat would decrease. Similarly, the yield of crops within each
salinity category would remain the same but because of the smaller area of
lower yielding saline lands, the overall yield of the cropped lands would
increase by about 10%, and the cropping intensity would be almost unchanged
from 106% in 1980 to 107% 20 years later.
5.07      The cropping pattern would change moderately with the Project.  The
percentage of wheat and cotton would decrease slightly from 41% to 37.8%,
barley would be grown on saline lands for animal feed, and vetch-oats mixture
would be introduced as a winter fodder crop. As in the without Project situa-
tion, the yield of crops within each salinity category would remain unchanged
as a result of the installation of tubewells, but the overall yield would
slightly increase due to the lower proportion of saline land. Cropping inten-
sity would increase from 106% to 117%.

5.08      The proportion of sugar beet in the cropping pattern is expected to
increase both with and without the Project as the result of an instruction to
farmers under Law 14 of 1975 (para. 1.07) to increase sugar beet to supply the
factory presently under construction at Deir-ez-Zor.
5.09      Although yields on land within each salinity class would not be
changed by the drainage improvements, yield increases are anticipated as a
result of the inclusion of agricultural research and extension in the Project.
An increase in yields of 7% is expected to result from improved farm practices
accompanied by 10% increase in farm production costs due to increased use of
fertilizer and plant production. In consequence, net farm income would in-
crease by some 5%. These increases are considered to be small, but they would
more than cover the cost of providing the research and extension services.
5.10      The provision of improved research and extension is considered
vital to ensure the improved seeds and yields necessary to obtain the full
benefits of the follow-up irrigation rehabilitation and reclamation phase of
development in the Lower Euphrates Valley. Establishment of these services
under the present project would ensure that the benefits from the services
would be immediately available to farmers at the beginning of the follow-up
phase.
Production and Markets
5.11      Production from the Project area is summarized in Table 5.2.  With
the Project full production would be reached by 1987, six years after the
tubewells in Zone 3 come into operation. The increases in production above
1980 levels would be small except for sugar beet which would increase from
87,000 tons to 220,000 tons. Marketing of Project output would be mainly
through the official channels as described in paras. 2.37 and 2.41. Existing
markets would be sufficient for all produce. The large increase in sugar beet
would supply less than 60% of the 400,000 ton annual capacity of the factory
under construction at Deir-ez-Zor.
5.12      Without the Project production of most crops would fall by about a
quarter by 1990 and by about a third by the year 2000. Only sugar beet would
increase in production from 87,000 tons in 1980 to 105,000 tons in response to
Government instructions. Wheat production would fall by nearly 40% from 61,000
tons to 38,000 tons, and the Lower Euphrates Valley which is at present self-
sufficient in wheat would become a deficit region. A serious problem of sur-
plus processing capacity would deveolp in the Lower Euphrates Valley. Sugar
beet production would be sufficient to supply only a quarter of the annual
requirements of the factory and cotton production would fall from 62,000 tons
to 44,000 tons. The existing cotton ginnery at Deir-ez-Zor which in recent
years has suffered a shortage of power, would increase to 80,000 tons, and it
would have to operate at no more than 55% of capacity. Further, since cotton
and sugar beet compete for the use of the same land in summer, there would be
no scope for substituting cotton for sugar beet or vice-versa without further
reducing supplies of the other crop. Severe surplus capacity would also
develop in the vegetable processing factory now under construction at Meyadine.



- 39 -
5.13      Although with Project production would not be much greater than 1980
levels, the incremental production from the Project would be considerable for
the three main crops wheat, cotton and sugar beet. Incremental wheat (22,000
tons) would be equivalent to about 13% of present annual wheat imports, incre-
mental sugar beet (14,000 tons refined sugar) equivalent to about 9% of pres-
ent sugar imports and incremental cotton (26,000 tons) equivalent to 25% of
raw cotton exports.
Prices
5.14      The Bank's commodity projections for 1980 and 1985 have been used as
a basis for calculating border prices. They have been adjusted for transport
costs in Syria and for by-products and expressed in mid-1977 constant prices.
During recent years the controlled farmgate prices that apply for most com-
modities have been considerably below the equivalent border prices in interna-
tional trade. However, this situation has now changed as international prices
have stabilized or fallen, and official domestic prices have continued to rise.
However, future financial prices of sugar beet are expected to remain above,
and of cotton below, the equivalent border price, as a result of Government
policy to increase domestic sugar production. The Bank's projections have
also been used as a basis for calculating future fertilizer prices. Prices of
other farm inputs are not expected to change in constant prices from mid-1977
levels.
C. Beneficiaries, Farmers' Benefits and Repayment Capacity
Beneficiaries
5.15      The Project would directly benefit a total 23,000 farm families
(175,000 people) cultivating 75,000 ha of land in 1980 of which 41,000 ha of
land would not be subject to salinity, and 34,000 ha would be moderately or
severely saline land. In 1980, the Project area would provide permanent
employment for about 25,000 workers with about 200 person-days each. Farm
survey data indicates that about 1.4 million person-days of seasonal employment
would also be provided, mainly for cotton picking, and summer vegetables, 75%
of which would be carried out by women. With the Project, permanent employ-
ment would increase slightly to about 210 person-days annually, and seasonal
employment would increase to about 1.9 million days. Without the Project,
seasonal employment would be almost eliminated (300,000 days) and permanent
employment would decrease by about 15% from 1980 levels (less than 22,000
people working 200 days each). It is likely that there would be substantial
emigration from the Lower Euphrates Valley.
Farm Budgets
5.16      Data are not available to indicate how much saline and non-saline
land individual farmers hold. It has been assumed that because of some
fragmentation of plots, the majority of farmers have part of their farms
on saline areas and part on non-saline. An average farmer who, in 1975,
had 3.7 ha available for cultivation would by 1980 have only 3.3 ha, since 10%



- 40 -
would be abandoned between 1975 and 1980 when the first tubewells would come
into operation. Details of farm budgets for an average farmer cultivating
3.3 ha are given in the Project File. Net farm income after deducting farm
operating costs but before taking into account rent paid by the 22% of farmers
who are share-croppers or who lease land would be:
With Project    Without Project
1980     1987-2000        1990        2000
Net Farm Income in SL                    6,000         7,100       4,800       4,200
Net Farm Income in US$                   1,500         1,800       1,200       1,100
5.17      With the Project, an average farmer's annual income would increase
by 18% above the 1980 situation by the sixth year. This increase of 18% may
be considered as comprising two parts, an increase due to the installation of
tubewells leading to an increase in production of 13% and a further increase
of 5% in yield due to improved farming practices and increased use of inputs
resulting from the Project's extension and research component. Without the
Project, the area of cultivable land available to an average farmer would fall
from 3.3 ha in 1980 to 2.0 ha in the year 2000, when he would have lost 40% of
his cultivable land.
5.18      The farm size distribution (para. 2.20) has been used to give an
indication of incomes on holdings of different sizes, for comparison with
incomes elsewhere in Syria. The relative poverty level has been taken as one
third of the average urban household income. It is estimated at US$175 per
capita in 1977, or about SL 4,700 per family of 6.8 persons in the Lower
Euphrates Valley. Table 5.3 shows that in 1980 half the families would be
below the relative 1977 poverty level, and even after the Project has reached
full production over 40% of the families would remain below the poverty level.
Without the Project, income levels would decline until after 20 years more
than two-thirds of the population would be in the poverty group.

- 41 -
Farmers' Repayment Capacity
5.19      No direct contribution would be expected from the farmers towards
the costs of the Project for a number of reasons.
(a) Most farmers in the Project area have already suffered
considerable losses in farm income in recent years due
to the effects of salinity, and before the Project can
arrest the spread of salinity, the area of cropped land
available to the average farmer will have fallen by a
further 10% (para. 5.16). In spite of satisfactory
economic benefits the Project would increase average
farm income by no more than 18%.
(b) Allocation of costs only to land receiving benefits from
the Project would be physically and administratively dif-
ficult. The tubewells would lower the water table on some
69,000 ha of saline and abandoned land but half would not
benefit from the Project since it would already be aban-
doned by 1980, and no benefits would be realized until the
subsequent irrigation rehabilitation and reclamation mea-
sures are carried out during a future project.
(c) The composition of direct cost recovery could be counter-
productive. During the investigation phase, a number of
observation wells have been destroyed by farmers who were
not informed about their purpose and unaware of the poten-
tial for reclamation. A tax on drainage wells from which
no benefit could be perceived would only encourage farmers
to damage them.
(d) Project costs would be partly recovered indirectly from
receipts for cotton, the major crop in the Valley, for
which farmers receive a controlled price lower than the
border price. In effect the controlled price includes a
producer tax, estimated at SL 190 per ton of cotton. The
incremental cotton production resulting from the Project
would amount to 14,000 tons by 1990 for which the tax would
be worth SL 2.6 million annually, and 19,000 tons by the
year 2000 worth SL 3.6 million in incremental tax. This
would be sufficient to cover 60% of the Project's operation
and maintenance cost.
(e)  A cost recovery analysis was carried out (Annex 2, Table 1)
which indicates that if all the farmers' extra ability to
repay costs were to be taxed away (100% rent recovery index),
some 83% of the Project's capital and operating costs could
be recovered by the Government (i.e. the cost recovery
index would be 83%). However, since the majority of the
farmers are in the Bank's target group and more than 40%
of them would remain below the poverty threshold after the



- 42 -
Project, there would be little point in taxing them heavily,
on grounds of income distribution.  If, as recommended
above, the only direct contribution to public sector funds
would be from the tax on cotton sales, some 15% of Project
costs would be recovered from the beneficiaries. The rent
recovery index in this case would be 18%.
5.20      The main scope for recovering Project costs would be during the sub-
sequent irrigation rehabilitation and reclamation phase when large increases
in production and farm incomes are expected. Farmers should be able to afford
to contribute to recovery of the costs of the Project during the second phase,
since the magnitude of both costs and benefits per hectare of the subsequent
irrigation phase would be some five times those of the present drainage Project.
D. Project Benefits
5.21      The net annual value of incremental agricultural production would
be SL 46 million (US$12 million) by 1988, and SL 56 million (US$14 million)
by the 20th year. In deriving these figures the incremental production
calculated in financial prices has been converted to economic prices. The
impact of the Project would be considerable. The agricultural income for the
whole Lower Euphrates Valley is projected to be SL 141 million (US$36 million)
in 1980. Without the Project it would decline by a quarter to SL 104 million
(US$26 million) by the year 2000, whereas with the Project it would rise by
17% to SL 165 million (US$42 million) in 1987.
5.22      The incremental production from the Project would not make a large
noticeable effect on the overall economy of the Lower Euphrates Valley com-
pared with 1980 when the Project would start to come into operation. At full
production after six years, Deir-ez-Zor Mohafazat would continue to be roughly
self-sufficient in food supplies. Increased population would absorb the addi-
tional food production. Sales of cotton lint from the gineery would increase
modestly, although sugar sales from the new factory would more than double.
Without the project, however, the whole economy of the Lower Euphrates Valley
would be seriously affected (para. 5.12).
5.23      The balance of trade would also deteriorate without the Project by
about US$12 million annually.  Exports of cotton, the largest single export
after petroleum, would be reduced by US$9 million.  Sugar imports would
increase by US$6 million, and wheat imports would increase by US$5 million.
5.24      One benefit that has not been taken into account in the economic
analysis because of lack of information is the cost of resettlement that would
be necessary without the Project. Some villages in the Lower Euphrates Valley
have already been abandones, but it is not known what happened to the families
involved, whether they migrated out of the region or whether they were absorbed
on farms within the Project area. Families whose farms are located on the
more saline lands would be forced to abandon their farms if no action is taken
to arrest the spread of salinity. Costs of resettlement have not been added



- 43 -
to the without Project costs. Instead it has been assumed that these families
would be absorbed on part of the land in the Valley owned by their own rela-
tives or kinship groups.
5.25      The Project would also contribute directly to the subsequent irriga-
tion rehabilitation and reclamation phase (paras. 3.01-3.06). It would pro-
vide initial drainage for 39,000 ha of abandoned land which would be reclaimed
during the second phase. The full results of the research component included
in the Drainage Project would also be available for dissemination by the exten-
sion service during the second phase.
E. Project Costs
5.26      Project costs are estimated at SL 156 million (US$39 million) includ-
ing physical contingencies but excluding duties, taxes and price contingencies.
Cost per hectare would be SL 2,250 (US$550) for the 69,000 ha affected by the
Project. This includes 35,000 ha of abandoned land, which it is assumed
would not be reclaimed until the subsequent reclamation phase, and from which
no benefits have been calculated. If only 30,000 ha of land presently in
production and protected by the Project is taken into account (which would be
appropriate if there was to be no subsequent reclamation phase), then the cost
would be SL 5,200 (US$1,300) per hectare. Even using the higher figure, the
cost per hectare is less than a quarter of the cost of developing new irriga-
tion land in the Euphrates Basin, such as in the Balikh Irrigation Project now
estimated at SL 25,500 (US$6,500) per hectare.
F. Economic Rate of Return, Sensitivity Analysis, and Risks
Economic Rate of Return
5.27      The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the Project is estimated at 15%
over a 22 year period (Annex 2 Table 2). The ERR in Zone 1 which is estimated
at 16% would be higher than for Zones 2 and 3 (13%), mainly due to the cost of
the additional investigations that will have to be made prior to implementation
of the Project in the two latter zones. The use of higher physical contingen-
cies to take into account the less precise information available in Zones 2 and
3 makes less than one percent difference to the ERR. There would be little
difference in the ERR between the different parts of the Project area.
5.28       It is likely that the official exchange rate understates the value
to the economy of foreign exchange used in carrying out the Project and saved
through larger cotton exports and reduced sugar and wheat imports, relative
to the value of domestic resources. However, since no precise estimates are
available, the official exchange rate at the time of the Mission's visit
(US$1.00 = SL 3.95) has been used in the economic analysis. Labor-shortages
are not expected with the Project due to the small increases in production.
A conversion factor of 1.0 has been used to derive the economic cost of
farm labor.



- 44 -
Sensitivity Analysis and Risks
5.29      A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine which
variables would be most crucial to the success of the Project, and to ascer-
tain the main risks involved. The results of this analysis are summarized
below:
Table 5.4: ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Economic Rate
of Return (%)
Projected Rate of Return on Project                                  15
20% Increase in Capital Costs                                        13
20% Decrease in Benefits                                             12
2-year Delay in Completion of Construction                           11
No Benefits from Research and Extension                              10
The Project would not be very sensitive to increases in investment costs or
agricultural benefits lower than projected. A 20% increase in capital costs
or a 20% reduction in benefits would reduce the ERR by 2% and 3% respectively.
5.30      The main risks involved in the Project are the technical risks
(paras. 3.15-3.16). As proposed by the Consultants, the Project would have
an ERR of 14% based on 138 tubewells, assuming no incremental production from
inclusion of agricultural research or extension. Since the technical risks
of groundwater development are difficult to estimate, it was decided to
increase the number of wells to 170 (para. 3.16) to provide a larger margin
of safety. There are also administrative risks associated with Project con-
struction. It is possible that there may be delays in the award of contracts
by GADEB, in procurement of equipment, or construction of civil works. By
permitting more land to be abandoned, any delays would reduce the area pro-
tected by the Project and its benefits. A two-year delay in completion of
construction would reduce the ERR to 11%. Other risks would arise during
Project implementation. It is possible that the extension service might not
succeed in disseminating information as well as anticipated.  If the extension
service failed completely then it is estimated that there would still be a
small increase in agricultural production due to the farmers own efforts to
increase productivity and the EER would be 10%.
VI, RECOMMENDATIONS AND LOAN CONDITIONS
6.01      During Negotiations the following main assurances were obtained that:
(a) The Ministry of Agriculture staff would be responsible for
the research and extension activities proposed as a part of
the Project (para. 4.07), and would continue to organize and
operate an extension service (para 4.09).



- 45 -
(b) Consultants would assist GADEB in the evaluation of bidding
documents and supervision of construction for all three
Zones in the Project area (paras. 3.18, 3.19).
(c) A monitoring unit would be established which would collect
soil and water samples from specific sites at regular
intervals (para. 4.11) including checking the salinity
levels in the Euphrates River upstream and downstream
of the Project area to determine the effect of the Project
(paras. 4.10, 4.11). GADEB would agree to send to the
Bank a report at annual intervals summarizing the results
of the monitoring unit for the first five years after
Project completion.
(d) Consultants would be appointed for agricultural research and
extension training (para. 4.10) and the Bank would be informed
immediately if alternative finance becomes available for
these experts (para. 4.10).
(e) Government would procure all civil works and equipment
according to the Bank's guidelines for procurement dated
March 1977 (paras. 3.26-3.28) and, in comparing bids from
the public and private sector, it would take into account
all quantifiable financial advantages not equally applicable
to all bidders (para. 3.26).
6.02      Recommendation.  With the above assurances and agreements, the pro-
posed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$30.0 million to the Syrian
Arab Republic for a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace.
