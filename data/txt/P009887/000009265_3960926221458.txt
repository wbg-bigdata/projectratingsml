2.      Backgroun     India's urban population is expected to grow from 160
million in 1981 to 320 million in 2000, or from about a quarter to a third of
the total population. The Government of India (GOI) is faced with now issues
in urban social development and in exploring ways to ensure that the expanding
urban population has access to affordable and good quality social services.
GOI's Family Welfare Program, which includes family planning and maternal and
child health (MCH) services has had a predominantly rural orientation, but now
needs to make better provision for urban slum populations. Vital rates for
urban slum populations are substantially higher and contraceptive prevalence
rates significantly lower than those for non-slum populations. In Bombay and
Madras, contraceptive prevalence in the slums is abc-ut 250 while it is over 604
among the middle and upper classes. Infant mortality rates in slum areas
average about 100 per 1,000 live births as against about 20 for the non-slum
population. Given the relatively easier atccess to health facilities compared
to rural areas, the presence of more private health institutions in urban
areas, and the availability of information on the mass media, these slum rates
are unacceptable.
3.      The demand for contraception by the urban slum dweller appears to be
constrained not only by limited access to service facilities and poverty, but
also by low levels of understanding and knowledge of modern contraception,
particularly of temporary methods. To overcome these constraints, the family
welfare program has to develop a pattern of service delivery based on
conveniently located fixed facilities that will provide a wider range of
affordable services, and also serve as a base for out each activities. The
development of strong outreach programs is essential and a necessary compliment
to infrastructural development, if family welfare services are to be expanded
at a rate and on a scale that is both replicable and sustainable by Government.
In slum areas, outreach programs will have to concentrate on establishing
effective communication and contact with the target populations among the poor,
particularly eligible couples, mothers, and young children. Because family
welfare services are essentially promotive rather than curative, and are
considered of national importance in India, expenditures incurred by the States
are met entirely by GOI. In addition, only nominal fees or charges are levied
against beneficiaries who utilize public sector health and family welfare
service facilities.

main slemnt of 001's family welfare strategy: a o.w4utration of . rvtWc
delivery in rural areas a31A backward itricts bae  on tbe Mo"el PI=l or Area
Projacts Schem.  Towards that &in, IDA ha  firaned tor population projects
for a total of US$188.2 million.  The cmo_n objectivs of tae  projects have
ben to rOWcc fertility mid  rlity in aslseot   rr4  diotriets.  2ke first
have also included statewide activftl&s. The first project was cloaed in 1980
and the socond in :Xarch 1908.  Although pwoscts hav been gnerally well-
tmlmst4  sad .cU.ap   i*. eewen+    _eAe)q.ir-                         -. ~
slower than planned, with both projects being fully dLsbursed In about seven
years. The lesso"s learned so far from these projects are that: (a) improvLng
the quality and management of family welfare facilities is a critical factor in
influencing the demand for servlces; (b) an analysis of local demographic
characteristics and famlly planning preferences is a prerequilite to developing
realistic targets and services; and (c) the participation of local comunftLes,
the private sector and other non-governmantal organizations must be encouraged
if the GOI's efforts to extend the family welfare program are to be succersful.
5.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Recognizing the problems associated
with a rapidly growing urban population, the GOI has recently broadened its
strategy to address family welfare needs in cities, particularly focusing on
low-income families. In 1985, the Urban Revamping Scheme, which aims to
strengthen the delivery of family welfare services to poor urban areas, was
initiated. IDA supports this initiative fully. Improving the health status of
the urban poor as well as their access to information and services contributes
to the improvement of the human environment and to the ameliorationi of urban
poverty.  The reduction of fertility rates in urban, as well as rural,
populations is also an IDA priority. The project is a pioneering one for IDA
and the first to deal with urban popula.ion issues in India. It takes account
of the lessons of earlier projects, and aims to assist the Government in
developing a replicable model for its policies and programs designed to moeet
the specific needs of the urban poor.
6.      Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project would be located in SMC,
MMC, and the Chingleput district in Tamil Nadu with the focus on slum
communities. The objectives of the project would be to (a) support the Urban
Revamping Scheme in the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay (BMC), the
Madras City Municipal Corporation (MKC) and the Chingleput district in Tamil
Nadu; (b) assist in strengthening the institutional capacity of Tamil Nadu, BMC
and MMC to deliver family welfare services, particularly to the poor sections
of urban communities; (c) improve the quality of family welfare services being
delivered in BMC, MMC and Chingleput; and (d) increase the participation of
Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and Private Medical Practitioners (PMPs)
in the delivery of family welfare services in poor urban areas of BMC, MMC and
Chingleput.
7.      Project Description    The proposed project would include the
following components: Service Delivery ExRansion: through the construction of

the Public Health Department, while in Tamil Nadu, Stering and Empowered
Comittees under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary would be established,
and the State and MMC Directorates of Family Welfare would be strengthened.
These institutions would develop capacities to design and implement Management
Information and Evaluation Systems (MIES) as well as Information, Education and
Communications (TEC) programs. Increasing Private Voluntary Organizations
(PVOs) and Private Hedical Practitioner (PMP) Rartici2atiot3: through assisting
PVOs to operate Health Posts (HPs), devolving Female Voluntary Health Worker
training and selected IEC activities to PVOs, supporting innovative family
welfare provision schemes of PVOs, and providing upgrading training and Liodern
contraceptive supplies to private medical practitioners.
8.      The total project cost is estimated at US$78.21 million; the proposed
IDA Credit of US$5/.0 million equivalent would cover about 74% of costs net of
taxes incluling all foreign costs and 71% of the local costs. GOI would
finance the remaining US$19.90 million and all taxes and duties. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status tf Bank Group
operations in India are given in Schedules C and D. Maps are also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7077-IN dated May 25, 1988 is distributed
separately.
9.      A;red Actions.  Tamil Nadu, BMC and MNC have already:  (a) appointed
Project Directors and Coordinators; and (b) instituted suitable arrangements
for PVO development and operation of Health Posts. IDA, Tamil Nadu, MKC and
BIIC have also agreed to the following: (a) staff for the effective implemen-
tation of family welfare outreach programs and for the strengthening of family
welfare program administration would be appointed and maintained at levels and
on a schedule acceptable to IDA; (b) annual plans, timetables and schedules for
the construction of Health Posts, IEC programs, staff training, and monitoring
and evaluation activities would be prepared and submitted to IDA by January 31
of each year; (c) the completion and review with IDA of assessments of
beneficiary needs and the training requirements of private medical
practitioners by March 31, 1989 and baseline surveys by June 30, 1989; and (d)
a formal mid-term review of project progress by December 31, 1992, including
monitorable benchmarks on which to assess progress.
10.          Benefits.  The proposed project will assist the GOI in developing
a replicable model for service delivery in urban slum areas. It will also
