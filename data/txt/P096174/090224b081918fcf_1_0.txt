                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The program's overall development objective is to assist the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its service
                         delivery. More specifically, the project would aim to strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR's limited budget resources through better prioritization and partnership
                         arrangements, facilitating scaling-up and better linking of plans and budgets.

                         Global Environment objective Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3
                          The global environment objective of the program would be to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. Specific global objectives would be addressed
                         through GEF financing in strategic areas to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. The global environment objective would be achieved by applying
                         an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach in priority watershed areas and selected sites of global significance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During the past six months the project has made commendable progress towards achieving its development objectives with most of its 15 outcome and intermediate level indicators
                         having been fully or partially achieved. For the Development Objective indicators, the targets for reduction in particulate matter and ecosystems investments have already been fully
                         achieved; the rationalization plans for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR's) Bureaus have been prepared and now await approval by the Department of
                         Budget and Management (DBM); and a follow up to the baseline survey is to be completed in June of 2013 which will determine the change in public satisfaction with DENR's
                         services. Both Global Environmental Indicators have already been achieved. Other major achievements include: (a) completion of forest boundary delineation including production of
                         maps; (b) significant progress on the cadastral surveys; (c) advances in the Manila Bay clean-up activity; (d) institutionalization of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool at all
                         protected areas being supported by the project; (e) standardized procedures for the issuance of tenure instruments; and (f) approaches for the rehabilitation of abandoned mines
                         tested and piloted. Given this improved performance, including accelerated disbursement (82% of loan funds and 78% of the grant) together with satisfactory performance on
                         procurement and financial management, the Bank has agreed to government's request for a one year extension for the ENRMP loan and grant from December 31, 2012 to December
                         31, 2013 in order to fully utilize the project funds. During this extended period the major activities under the loan would be: a) the National Greening Program, b) Comprehensive
                         cadastral surveying, c) The Manila Bay & Inland Waterway “clean-up? program; and d) Installation and operationalization of the MIS; while for the GEF grant on-going activities in
                         integrated ecosystems management would be completed, with increased attention given to livelihood activities.
