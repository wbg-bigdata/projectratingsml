                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The program's overall development objective is to assist the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its service
                         delivery. More specifically, the project would aim to strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR's limited budget resources through better prioritization and partnership
                         arrangements, facilitating scaling-up and better linking of plans and budgets.

                          The global environment objective of the program would be to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. Specific global objectives would be addressed
                         through GEF financing in strategic areas to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. The global environment objective would be achieved by applying
                         an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach in priority watershed areas and selected sites of global significance.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There has been encouraging progress, in terms of physical and financial accomplishments, with most of the 25 performance indicators for the project having been fully or partially
                         achieved. Major achievements include: progress on the DENR's reform agenda; completion of forest boundary delineation including production of maps; significant progress on the
                         cadastral surveys; achievement of investment targets for the rehabilitation of ecosystems; advances in the Manila Bay clean-up activity; institutionalization of the Management
                         Effectiveness Tracking Tool at all protected areas being supported by the project; procedures for the issuance of tenure instruments standardized; and increase in the number of
                         companies complying with environmental standards. The project has also improved its performance on procurement and sustained that on financial management, including
                         significantly increasing the rate of fund liquidation. Based on contracts and obligations already in process, it is likely that by the end of December 2012 there will still be some US$7.8
                         million remaining unutilized under the loan and about US$2 million under the grant. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) management has indicated its
                         intentions of seeking a one year extension for the ENRMP loan and grant from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 in order to fully utilize the project funds. During this
                         extended period the major activities under the loan would be: i) the National Greening Program, ii) Comprehensive cadastral surveying, iii) The Manila Bay & Inland Waterway
                         “clean-up? program; and iv) Installation and operationalization of the MIS; while for the GEF grant on-going activities in integrated ecosystems management would be completed, with
                         increased attention given to livelihood activities.
