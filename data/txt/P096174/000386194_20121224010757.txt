7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The program's overall development objective is to assist the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness in its service delivery. More specifically, the project
would aim to strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR's limited budget resources through better
prioritization and partnership arrangements, facilitating scaling-up and better linking of plans and budgets.

                                Extension of Closing Date

1.    The closing date for The Philippines: National Program Support for Environment
and Natural Resources Management Project (Loan Number 7470-PH/Grant Number
TF90073), (P096174/P091147) will be extended from December 31, 2012 until
December 31, 2013.

2.     The project has made very encouraging progress during the past year and was
rated Moderately Satisfactory during the last Implementation Review mission in June
2012. Most of the 25 performance indicators have been fully or partially achieved. For
the US$50 million loan, disbursements increased significantly from US$21.9 million in
December 2011 to US$41.25 million currently. For the US$7 million GEF grant,
disbursements are currently at US$5.0 million compared with US$2.9 million in
December 2011.

3.       Major achievements include: progress on the DENR's reform agenda with
rationalization plans prepared for several of its Bureaus and only awaiting DBM
approval; completion of forest boundary delineation including production of maps;
significant progress on the cadastral surveys; achievement of investment targets for the
rehabilitation of ecosystems;        advances in the Manila Bay clean-up activity;
institutionalization of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool at all protected areas
being supported by the project; standardized procedures for the issuance of tenure
instruments; and increase in the number of companies complying with environmental
standards. The project has also improved its performance on procurement and sustained
that on financial management, including significantly increasing the rate of fund
liquidation. Based on contracts and obligations already in process, it is projected that by
the end of December 2012 there will still be about US$7.8 million remaining unutilized
under the loan and less than US$2 million under the grant. Based on progress achieved
to date and the plan for 2013, it is likely that the project development objectives will be
fully achieved.

4.      The proposed extension is necessary in order to complete a few activities which
began late in the project or were delayed which would fully utilize the project funds.
These are reflected in the Action Plan agreed with the Bank and discussed during the
December 2012 Implementation Support mission. These activities are: ( i) the National
Greening Program; (ii) Comprehensive cadastral surveying; ( iii) The Manila Bay and
Inland Waterway “clean-up? program; (iv) Installation and operationalization of the MIS;
and (v) integrated ecosystems management focusing on livelihood activities.

5.    There are no outstanding project audit and other project financial reports from the
DENR.

6.     This will be the first extension of the project.

Project Development Objective (PDO): The program’s overall development objective is to assist the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to improve effic iency and effectiveness in its
service delivery. More specifically, the project would aim to strengthen the allocative efficiency of DENR’s limited budget resources through better prioritization and partnership arrangements, facilitating
scaling-up and better linking of plans and budgets.

Global Environment Objective Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3: The global environment objective of the program would be to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. Specific global
objectives would be addressed through GEF Financing in strategic areas to enhance ecosystem services for global and local benefits. The global environment objective would be achieved by applying an
integrated ecosystem management (IEM) approach in priority watershed areas and selected sites of global significance.
