INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR AN AGRO-INDUSTRIES CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of Us$54
million to help finance an agro-industries credit project. The loan would
have a term of 15 years, including five years of grace, with interest at
7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "The Economic and Social Development
of Brazil" (R73-87), dated March 12, 1973, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on April 2, 1973. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
A review of Brazil's macro-economic performance, its income distribution
and economic policy was contained in the President's Report on a loan for
a Power Distribution and Sub-Transmission project (R73-58) which was approved
by the Board on April 10, 1973. The passages concerned are reproduced in
Annex I of this report.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS DI BRAZIL
Bank Operations
3.        A description of the Bank's lending strategy in Brazil was
also contained in the President's Report on the Power Distribution and
Sub-Transmission Loan, and is reproduced in Annex I. Bank lending to
Brazil was very active in FY72, when seven loans totalling US$437 million
were approved. So far, in FY73, five loans amounting to US$133.7 million
have been approved covering an Agricultural Settlement project in North-
east Brazil, the Fourth Highway Construction project, a Grain Storage
project, an Interim Second Livestock Development project and the above-
mentioned Power Distribution and Sub-Transmission project; the proposed
loan would bring the total for FY73 to US$187.7 million. A loan of US$125
million for the Itumbiara Hydroelectric project will be presented to the
Executive Directors in July. We are also holding discussions with the
Brazilians on an investment program in the port of Recife, a highway project,
a railway rehabilitation program, a hydroelectric project on the Sao Francisco
River in the Northeast, a water supply program, a land settlement project in the



Amazon and a third livestock development project, which would extend the
Bank-financed ongoing program to smaller farmers. We hope to present
these projects to the Executive Directors in the next twelve months.
4.        By April 30, 1973, Brazil had received 46 loans from the Bank
amounting to US$1,566.3 million.  Annex II gives a summary statement of
loans and. credits as of ApriL 30, 1973.  Of the loans declared effective,
31 have not been fully disbursed, During FY65 through FY69, disbursements
averaged only US$10 million per year, lncreasing to US$66 million in
FY70, US$75 million in FY71, US$137 million in FY72, and US$92 million
in the first half of FY73. Disbursements should continue to increase
during the next few years. Comments on the implementation of individual
projects are contained in Arniex II.
IFC Operations
5.        IFC has commiLtted more financial resources to Brazil than to any
other country. Since 1957, CFC has made 21 cormaitments to Brazil, totalling
US$103.3 million, of which US$7.2 million has been repaid and US$3&.6 million
sold.  Of the balance of US$57.5 million, US$40.6 million represents loans
and US$1609 million equity. A summary of IFC's investments up to April 30,
1973, is also given in Anrnx II.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
6.        The proposed agro-industries credit loan would be the Bank's fifth
for the agricultural sector in Brazil. Previous loans include the first
Livestock Development Project (Loan 516-BR) in 1967 and three loans in 1972:
the Alto Turi Land Settlement; Project (Loan 853-BR), the Grain Storage Project
(Loan 857-BR) and the Interim Second Livestock Development Project (Loan
868-BR).
7.        Analysis of the agricultural sector has been an integral part of
the Banik's economic reports. The current economic report contains two
volumes dealing with the agricultural sector. Volume VI deals witlh the
problems and prospects of agriculture in the Center-South, while Volume
IV analyzes the agricultural sector in the Northeast as part of an overall
evaluation of the efforts being made to develop that; region.
Government Strategy
8.        The Government's strategy in the agricultural sector has been
to promote a rapid expansion of output, to diversify crop production
and to secure a massive increase in exports of non-traditional products.
Thus, agricultural output has enjoyed a healthy growth of 4.5 percent
a year over the last decade and the Government expects this growth to
accelerate to 7 percent a year in its current three year plan. Agri-
cultural exports other than coffee represented 31 percent of total
national exports in 1971 compared with 24 percent in 1962. Exports of all
principal crops have been increasing, with the most dynamic increases in
recent years being in beef and oilseed exports, which experienced percentage



-3-
increases of value exported of 417 and 369 percent, respectively, from
1965 to 1971.  Coffee, however, continues to be the major export
item; the value of coffee exported-rose 25 percent during the 1964-65 -
to 1969-70 period, due mainly to rising world prices and increased value
added in Brazilian processing.
9.        Government emphasis on the promotion of non-traditional exports
is being accompanied by a comprehensive program for more efficient coffee
production. Begun in 1972, the program has as its goal raising annual
production capacity from 22 million bags in 1972 to about 28 million bags
by 1976-77. The modernization of coffee production involves the planting
of new trees, the promotion of fertilizer and pesticide use and the instal-
lation of a system of price and credit incentives.
10.       The Government's policies to diversify and expand agricultural
exports are directed at easing the foreign exchange constraint which is the
dominant short- to medium-term impediment to Brazil's economic growth. To
increase foreign exchange earnings, the Government has instituted an "export
corridors" program, under which a series of export targets have been estab-
lished to be met by the mid to late 1970's for the export of non-traditional
products through five transport corridors. The program would increase Brazil's
coarse grain, soybean and beef exports from 1.2 million, 1.1 million and
123,ooo tons, respectively, in 1971, to 5 million, 4 million and 500,000
tons by the late 1970's. The dramatic increases recorded in expanding
exports of these products since the mid-1960's and current Governmont efforts
to provide needed credit, storage, transportation and processing facilities
for further expansion, indicate that there is a good chance of achieving
the targets that have been established.
The Two Agricultural Sectors
11.       The important gains made in Brazilian agriculture should not
obscure the dualism of the sector. In the South and West a dynamic modern
sector predominates, characterized by large capital-intensive production
units. It is this area that has been responsible for the increase in
Brazil's non-traditional exports in the past ten years. At the other
extreme, there exists in the Northeast (in addition to large but not very
efficient sugar estates) an impoverished stagnant smallholder and share-
cropper sector producing the barest subsistence necessities on poor,
drought-plagued land.
12.       The modern agricultural sector in the South and West has shown
phenomenal growth in the past decade through the application of capital and
modern inputs and the cultivation of new land, thus reducing Brazil's need
for imported food, especially wheat (in spite of a setback in 1972 due to
poor weather). Future growth opportunities in this sector of agriculture
are especially promising in new lands opening up in the West (Goias, Mato
Grosso and parts of Minas Gerais).



13.        Northeast subsistence agriculture, in contrast to the gains and
bright prospects for agricultural development in the South and West, presents
one of Brazil's most stubborn development problems. The most vigorous
approach to this problem is now the Government's program of opening up new
lands for settlement, on the weste m fringes of the Northeast and in the Amazon.
Within the Northeast itself, the Government is making efforts to modernize
the sugar industry and distribute some of the large sugar lands to farm
laborers through a recently reinvigorated land reform program. These efforts
are at an early stage and have not yet been evaluated. The Government has
also made available heavily subsidized credit to Northeast farmers, but credit
programs do not in present c:ircumstances reach the smallest subsistence
producers, who operate on the fringes of the money economy. Moreover, North-
east agriculture is still ha:Vered by inadequate knlowledge about the correct
application of modern inputs under conditions of periodic drought, a lack
that needs to be remedied through a well focused and organized research
and extension effort.
14.       The Bank is now actively exploring with the authorities the
possibility of identifying additional agricultural projects for Bank
financing in the Northeast. Possible projects include intensified
agricultural research, expansion of the extension service, support to
land reform efforts, settlement in new areas, integrated rural develop-
ment in already settled regions, and credit programs, both for farm
development and for development of agricultural processing industries,
Government Beef Policy
15.       Despite Brazil's great natural advantages for cattle raising
the growth of the beef cattle sector has been barely sufficient to keep
pace with rising domestic demand. In spite of this, Government policies
facilitated a. rapid rise Ia beef exports.  While beef output increased
at an annual rate of slightly below 5 percent between 1966 and 1971,
beef exports expanded impressively from 30,000 metric tons in 1966 to
123,000 in 1971 and 174,0010 tons in 1972 (in value US$20 million, US$149
million and US$200 million, respectively).   Even at the expanded 1972
export levels, however, exported beef represented less than 10 percent
of national production.
16.       The Government's beef policy has as its objective reachirg
500,000 tons of exports by the late 1970's, while avoiding domestic
beef supply shortages and sharp domestic price increases. In part,
because of the sharp rises in world beef prices over the past few months,
the domestic price of beef is 30 percent lower than world beef prices,
but the Government's long-term objective is to allow beef prices to
gradually rise and eventually reach world market prices. Over the past
three years, the price of cattle has risen, in nominal terms, 162 percent
(representing an irncrease of 60 percent in real terms), greatly increasing
incentives for ranchers to increase production. Earlier this year, in
response to unusually sharp price increases that occurred after domestic
price controls were lifted, the Government established informal agreements
with ranchers and wholesalers to hold the line on prices, so that its



overall objective of containing inflation to 12 percent in 1973 could be
realized. At the same time it reduced export quotas and imposed an export
tax to relieve the internal pressure on prices. Although present Govern-
ment quotas point to an almost 20 percent reduction in the tonnage of
exports for 1973, the Government retains a flexible policy which can lead
to subsequent increases, or decreases, depending on domestic market con-
ditions. During negotiations the Government affirmed its longer term goal
of expanding beef exports, its policy of permitting domestic beef prices to
rise in an orderly manner so that they will eventually meet world market
prices, and its intentions to maintain adequate price incentives for
ranchers and processors.
17.       The Government has undertaken a number of programs to realize
its objective of increasing production and raising the rate of herd growth
from the modest 3 percent average annual growth rate achieved during the
last several years. Its livestock development programs are being assisted
by loans from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the IBRD, and
provides long-term loans to ranchers to increase the size and productivity
of their herds. The Bank loans also help defray the costs of pasture
research and marketing. The Government, with the support of an IDB
loan, has undertaken a program to eradicate hoof and mouth disease in
the national herd. Another policy aimed at increasing the national herd
prohibits processors from slaughtering female bovines of breeding age
and capacity.
18.       A final important element in the Government's beef policy, and
one most directly related to the capital requirements for the proposed
project, is the drive to raise the hygienic standards of processors to a
level compatible with international standards. New federal hygiene standards
were introduced in 1971 and the Government has organized a national effort to
secure their implementation. In order to continue to meet changing interna-
tional sanitary standards, however, the new federal standards must be
continually updated. As a result one of the conditions of effectiveness is
that the Government update its regulations to meet international standards.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.       A report entitled "Appraisal of an Agro-Industries Credit Project",
dated June 1, 1973, is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A loan and project summary is presented in Annex III.
20.       The project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Brazil
in November-December 1972. Negotiations took place from May 21 to May 25,
1973. The Borrower, the Federative Republic of Brazil, was represented by
a team headed by Dr. Paulo Yokota, Director of the Central Bank.
21.       The project will finance the modernization and expansion of agri-
cultural processing industries in Brazil's Center-South so that they can



-6-
help meet the rising domestic and export demand for processed food and feed
products. The project is a part of Brazil's "export corridors" program,
referred to in Part III above, which has as its goal expanding and diversify-
ing exports in order to alleviate the balance of payment constraint to
economic growth. The project consists of a program of credits to industries
engaged in processing beef, oilseed, milk and other agricultural products,
with the bulk of the financing (estimated at 80 percent) expected to be used
for beef processing.  All of the sub-projects, with the exception of milk
processing, would have significant export components. The milk processing
projects would produce import substitutes.
22.       The credits for beef processing would be extended principally to
rehabilitate and expand existing facilities (although a few new plants would
also be included) to enable processors to increase production and meet
domestic and international sanitary standards. Investments would be made
for processing and cold storage facilities, as well as refrigerated vehicles.
Plants would be located in the 10 southern and central states, and the Federal
District, although it is expected that credit demand will be concentrated in
the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. Raw material
for oilseed plants (6 percent of total project financing) would primarily be
soybeans, with peanuts and cottonseed also to be utilized. The objective would
be to modernize plants, finance the merger of existing firms to make the
industry more efficient and expand existing production capacity. Most oilseed
plant financing would be done in the states of Minas Gerais, Parana and
Rio Grande do Sul. The milk component (an estimated 7 percent of total project
financing) would mainly finance new plants for producing more highly processed
products such as cheese and powdered milk. The processed output, particularly
powdered milk, would be substitutes for products now imported.   Expansion of
the milk processing industry is expected to help moderate the seasonal price
fluctuations for milk products. Plants financed under the project would be
located mainly in the states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo. The miscellaneous
category (7 percent of total project financing) would be used principally for
financing export-oriented citrus fruit processing plants, although other
export-oriented production would be eligible, subject to prior Bank approval.
Channelling of Funds
23.      The Bank loan would be made to the Government, which would make
the proceeds available through the Central Bank for relending to the
Regional Development Bank for the Extreme South (Rio Grande do Sul" Santa
Catarina and Parana); the state development banks of Minas Gerais, Espirito
Santo, Sao Paulo and Parana; and the Banco do Brasil. The regional and
state development banks are owned wholly or in part by state governments,
and have as their primary function the promotion of economic development
by providing long-term credit to enterprises in priority sectors. The
Federal Government controlled Banco do Brasil is the country's largest
commercial bank, which has as its main objective the advancement of national
production. The Banco do Brasil would lend to eligible sub-borrowers



throughout the project area, but would have sole responsibility in those
states not covered by the state or regional banks. The Central Bank would
establish a project unit for the adrinistration of the project and a sepa-
rate project fund which would receive the proceeds of the Bank loan and the
Government's contributions. The participating banks would draw from this
fund to cover sub-loan disbursements. Prior Bank approval would be required
for the first sub-projects in each lending category, and also the first
sub-loan made by each of the participating banks. All sub-loans over Us$1.5
million would require Bank approval, and so would lending of more than US$2.0
million to any one sub-borrower.
Terms of Sub-loans and Terms to Borrowers
24.       Sub-loans would be limited to 80 percent of investment costs and
would have a maturity of up to 10 years; including a maximum grace period
of two years. Bank funds would furnish half of the funds for the sub-loans,
or 40 percent of project costs. The remaining funds for the sub-loans
would be contributed to the project fund by the Central Bank. Sub-borrowers
would pay interest at 5 percent, with full monetary correction of princi-
pal. The participating banks would pass on half of the interest payments
received by them to the Central Bank, thus retaining 2-1/2 percent interest
on adjusted principal in order to cover their expenses and risks adequately.
If the sums thus received by the Central Bank were insufficient to meet
the service on the Bank's loan (a matter of some uncertainty, depending on
relative movements of Brazilian prices and the cruzeiro exchange rate),
the Government would make up any shortfall. Sub-borrowers would also have
to pay a commitment fee of 1/2 percent on undisbursed loan balances, an
appraisal fee of one percent on the amount of the investment costs of sub-
projects, a tax of one percent of the initial loan amount and a tax of one
percent of each interest payment as it falls due.
25.       The loan would be the first the Bank has made to Brazil in which
relending would incorporate full monetary correction. Indexing of the loan,
as in the case of National Treasury Bonds (ORTN), would be based on a monthly
general price index prepared by the Getulio Vargas Foundation. The Second
Livestock loan approved last December involved an interest rate of 7-1/4 per-
cent on sub-loans, with required annual corrections on the principal of the
sub-loans in proportion to the changes in the cruzeiro/dollar exchange rate.
The 5 percent interest rate with full monetary correction of the proposed
loan would represent an increase of about 3 percentage points over the roughly
2 percent real rate of interest of the earlier project, assuming that Brazil
continues her present policy of devaluing the cruzeiro by the difference
between the rates of inflation in Brazil and the U.S., and that the latter
continues at recent levels.
26.       The loan would have a maturity of fifteen years, including five
years of grace, which is based on a commitment period of three years, a
maximum sub-loan maturity of ten years and possible setbacks or delays of
two years. The Government would be the Borrower and bear the exchange
risk.



-8-
Cost and Financing
27.       Project costs (wlhich are suz'marized in a~nnex III) are estimated at
the equivalent of USb135 million, of which US$21.4 million or 16 percent re-
presents foreign exchange costs. The Bank loan would thus be equivalent to
the full foreign exchange cost plus US$32.4 million of local costs. Bank
financing of local expenditures is justified because the flow of external capital
required to support Brazil's high rate of economic growth far exceeds
capital goods import needs of Brazilian development projects (see Annex I,
paragraph 8).
Procurement and Disbursement
28.       Equipment needed for the project would be procured by sub-borrowers
either from suppliers of their existing equipment, if required for purposes of
standardization, or from new suppliers after price comparison amoung at least
three suppliers. Bid awards lwould be reviewed by participating banks. As is
the case for the Bank's normal loans to development finance companies, inter-
national competitive bidding would not be practical, because of the small size
and specialized nature of the equipment requirements for project plants. In
addition, over 50 percent of the investments in this project are expected to
be for expansion and improvenmnt, so that new equipment must be compatible with
that already in place. Brazi'lian firms manufacturing meat processing equip-
ment, although having tariff protection of 30 to 50 percent, have selling
prices comparable to international suppliers and are sufficient in number
to assure adequate competition. These firms include at least 30 manufacturers
of processing equipment which have foreign participation either as subsidiaries
or through joint ownership or licensing arrangements. Disbursement
of the Bank loan would be madie against 50 percent of the Central Bank's re-
financing of sub-loans disbursed by the participating banks to the sub-borrowers.
An estimated schedule of disbursements is presented in Annex III.
Financial and Economic Benefits
29.       The beef processing component of the project would result in
increased and more hygienic production of beef for sale on both the domestic
and export markets. It is expected that in the first full year of develop-
ment, 1978, the project would result in 140,000 tons of incremental beef
exports, having an estimated value of US$160 million. The oilseed processing
component would result in the consolidation of small inefficient plants into
larger, more efficient installations. The milk processing, as well as mis-
cellaneous feed and food processing, would generate primary benefits in the
form of greater and more efficient production.    In addition, the milk processing
would produce products which can substitute for some that are now imported. There
would also be new incomes and employment generated for the farmers who would
supply inputs (including many relatively small farmers who are expected to
furnish milk under the dairy component of the project), for civil works con-
tractors, and for equipment suppliers.   The consuming public would benefit
from a more regular supply of dairy products, without wide price fluctuations.
The economic rates of return on the project are estimated to be 53 percent for
beef processing, 23 percent for oilseed processing, and 48 percent for milk
processing. Financial rates of return were calculated for nine models. The



- 9 -
rates of return varied between 13 and 24 percent, with the lowest returns
being shown by the smallest beef processing plants and the highest by the
largest beef processing plants. It is anticipated that the project will
generate 20,000 man-years of employment during construction. The labor
intensive meat plants and the new processing plants will generate 4,300
nat additional jobs when the project facilities become operational.
Environmental Effects
30.        Improvements in hygiene and better utilization of by-products
would greatly help in reducing the existing beef processing plants' un-
dssirable effects upon the environment. Most new facilities to be financed
under the project would be located close to production areas where population
density is very low, hence the safeguards required against air, odor and
noise pollution are minimal. Plants located in urban areas are generally
covered by existing zoning laws which guard against air, odor and noise
pollution. Adequate safeguards against water pollution will be taken under
the project.
PART V - LIEAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Federative Republic of Brazil
and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between Banco Central do Brasil and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the draft Resolution approving the
proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The major features of these agreements have already been described in this
report.
32.        There are three special conditions of loan effectiveness.  They
are (1) that the Government bring its beef export regulations up to date
so as to better meet the sanitary requirements of importing countries;
(2) a unit for project supervision be established in the Central Bank after
consultation with the Bank on key personnel, and (3) the Central Bank sign
a subsidiary loan agreement, containing lending criteria satisfactory to the
Bank, with at least one of the banks participating in the project. A
condition of disbursement for all banks participating in the project would
be that they sign subsidiary loan agreements with the Central Bank.
33.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
34.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

THE ECONOMY
(Extract from Report and Recommendation of the President to the Executive
Directors on a proposed loan to Light - Servicos de Eletricidade, S.A.
for a Power Distribution and Sub-Transmission Project)
Macro-Economic Performance
3.        After having grown by about 9 percent annually during 1968-70
Brazil's national product increased by an estimated 11 percent in 1971.
Indications are that growth was at least equally rapid in 1972. Indus-
trial production during the first six months of 1972 was almost 15 per-
cent greater in real tenms than during the equivalent period in 1971.
Output of Brazil's principal crops excluding coffee appears to have
increased by about 10 percent in 1972. Simultaneously, the Government
succeeded in its effort to reduce the annual rate of inflation from 20
to 15 percent. Reflecting good weather and sharp increases in crop
yields, food supplies were abundant and food prices rose by only about
half as much in 1972 as in 1971.
4.       EExport growth and diversification continue to be strong.
After slowing down from 19 percent in 1970 to 5 percent in 1971, largely
as a result of a drop in coffee prices, export growth accelerated during
1972. However, the extremely high rate of economic growth continues to
cause large increases in imports, which were up by about 27 percent in
the first semester of 1972 after increasing 20 percent in 1971. The
current account deficit in the balance of payments is likely to have
exceeded US$1.5 billion in 1972 compared with US$1.3 billion in 1971.
The increase in imports and in the size of the current account deficit
associated with the high rate of growth in recent years is a matter of
concern to the Brazilian authorities, since they recognize that it would
be difficult to finance such large trade deficits on a sustained basis.
For that reason, they aim to hold the rate of growth of imports below
that of exports, both by accelerating the pace of growth of exports and
by reducing import requirements. There is a good prospect that objective
can be achieved if the rate of growth of GDP is held to a level near the
8.5 percent per annum projected in the economic report. However, for
the present, the Government, rather than taking action immediately to
moderate the present 11 percent rate of growth, is giving additional
attention to export promotion and import substitution, through the system
of incentives for exports of manufactures, an "export corridors" program
designed to expand non-traditional agricultural exports such as corn,
soya and beef, and encouragement of domestic production of capital goods,
raw materials and intermediate goods (chemicals, petroleum and non-ferrous
metals). The authorities realize that if these programs fail to contain
the trade gap, they may have to take action to reduce the rate of growth,
but they feel that the balance of payments position is now strong enough
to make such action unnecessary in the near term.

5.        The substantial increase during 1971-72 in Brazil's foreign
exchange reserves, to a level approaching US$4 billion, was largely a
result of a large inflow of foreign capital. In 1972, more than
US$4.7 billion in gross loan capital, of which US$3.5 billion was in
the form of financial credits, flowed into Brazil.  Financial credits
represent, to some extent, a substitate for foreign direct investment
which takes this form because of more favorable tax and administrative
treatment accorded to interest payments than to profit remittances.
They are also a result of foreign borrowing by Brazilian private and
public enterprises necessitated by imperfections in the domestic
financial market which make loan and equity funds both expensive and
scarce. Their growth in recent years reflects the attractiveness of
Brazilian prosperity and stability to the international financial
community. However, the accumulation of financial credits is greater
than the Government expected, and to prevent this debt from causing
foreign liquidity problems, the authorities have imposed comprehensive
controls on debt maturities. The average term on new financial credits
in 1972 was four years as compared with two years in 1971 and a minimum
maturity of six years is now required. To protect the external liquidity
position, the Government is deliberately following a monetary policy which
results in substantial foreign exchange reserve accumulation. These re-
serves give the authorities an adequate margin of time to adjust their
overall economic policy in the event that the financial flows should be
reversed. The need to offset much of the increase in financial credits
with foreign exchange reserves reduces greatly the contribution which
such financial credits can make toward financing the trade deficit. In
this context, the existence of large reserves does not indicate that
Brazil has no need to increase the flow of long-term capital from abroad.
6.        Financial credits are only a partial and imperfect substitute
for long-term capital. The inflow of such credits, net of reserve build-
up, cannot be depended upon to cover as large a proportion of Brazil's
current account deficit as in the recent past if the debt service burden
is to remain manageable. A country at Brazil's stage of development can
be expected to run substantial current account deficits if rapid growth
is to be sustained. The mobilization of large flows of official term
capital will, therefore, play a crucial role over the long term.
7.        By the end of 1972, Brazil's total external debt is likely
to have exceeded US$9 billion, of which over US$5 billion is financial
credits. The overall debt service ratio was about 54 percent in 1972,
but the substantial reserves which Brazil has accumulated assure
liquidity and should be taken into consideration when appraising credit-
worthiness. Furthermore, this debt service ratio includes service on
all public and private debt, including that on financial credits, since
Brazil's debt data do not differentiate between public and private debt.
The debt service ratio for public and publicly guaranteed debt would be
very much lower. Service on total debt excluding financial credits (the
bulk of which is owed by private borrowers) was around 15 percent in 1972.

Nevertheless, it is clear that, however measured, Brazil's debt service
obligations are high. The country's creditworthiness depends on con-
tinued high caliber economic management.
8.        While the official loan capital needed to support Brazil's
economic growth targets is substantial, the direct import needs of most
public investment projects are relatively low, reflecting - inter alia --
the ability of Brazil's highly developed capital goods industry to com-
pete successfully under international competitive bidding. Hence, an
appreciable part of official external financing must continue to be
available to cover domestic expenditures.
Income Distribution and Economic Policy
9.        Although the overall growth and management of the Brazilian
economy in recent years has been outstanding Brazil continues to experience
highly unequal distribution of income accompanied by massive incidence of
absolute poverty. According to the best available statistics, in 1970 the
most affluent 20 percent of Brazil's income earners received 62.2 percent
of total money income while the poorest 20 percent received 3.2 percent of
total money income; i.e., the richest one-fifth of the population received
19 times as much income as did the poorest one-fifth. There occurred
reconcentration of income during the 1960's; in 1960 the income received
by the most affluent fifth was 16 times as great as the income received
by the poorest fifth. Absolute increases in money income levels were
achieved in every decile of the size distribution of Brazilian money
income during the 1960's. In the 9th and 10th deciles -- the highest
income brackets -- the increases were greatest, averaging 3.1 and 5.2 per-
cent annually in real terms, respectively. In the lowest four deciles
increases in per capita real money incomes averaged 1.7 percent per annum.
In part, the increases reflect increased monetization of the economy.
In 1970 the incidence of absolute poverty in Brazil continued to be high:
as much as one-third of total income recipients were receiving less than
Brazil's lowest legal minimum wage, about US$25 per month. It should be
added that the comparisons of changes in real terms suffer from more than
the usual statistical limitations in view of the degree of the Brazilian
inflation.  Further analysis of income distribution problems will be
found in paragraphs 35 to 53 of the economic report.
10.       In the early 1960's poor economic management led to an accelera-
tion of inflation -- which peaked at an annual rate of 144 percent during
the first quarter of 196h -- to balance of payments crisis -- which required
debt reschedulings in 1961 and 1964 -- and to economic stagnation; in 1963
per capita domestic product declined by 1.6 percent. Galloping inflation
tended to strike hardest at the wage earner, while economic stagnation left
the economy unable to absorb the large annual increments in its labor force.
Between 1964 and 1967 the Government implemented a price stabilization and
balance of payments retrenchment program. Not only did economic stagnation
continue during this period but stabilization efforts depended hea*ily on



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 9
income restraint policies. Both the economic crisis of the early 1960's
and the corrective measures taken subsequently by the Government are
likely to have contributed significantly to the deterioration of income
distribution which took place during the decade.
11.       Having (a) reduced inflation to an annual rate of about 20 per-
cent; (b) instituted automatic adjustment mechanisms such as the flexible
exchange rate and monetary correction of financial instnrments designed to
prevent price distortions from reemerging in a still inflationary environ-
ment; and (c) improved Brazil's capacity to import by promoting the ex-
pansion and diversification of exports, the Government, by 1968, was able
to undertake policies conducive to a resumption of the rapid economic
growth which the country had enjoyed in the 1950's. As noted, these
policies have been very successful.
12.       The Government counts primarily on the employment created at
rapid rates of growth to alleviate the dualism of the Brazilian economy
and the poverty which results from it.   The Government also believes
that maintenance of steady growth -- i.e., avoidance of any acceleration
of inflation and/or external liquidity problems such as those which led
to the stop-and-go development of the early and mid-1960's -- is essential
if further concentration of incomes is to be forestalled. Finally, through
profits controls and wage guidelines the Government is seeking to insure
that wage earners receive a fair share of the benefits of rapid growth.
The growth of employment and -- in some sectors -- wage rates which has
taken place since 1968 probably accounts for most of the improvement in
lower level incomes shown for the entire decade by the 1960 and 1970
censuses.
13.       It thus appears that in order to correctly evaluate the impact
on income distribution of policies pursued by the present Government it
would be necessary to use 1968 as the basis for comparison with 1972 data.
Unfortunately, there are as yet no sufficient statistics available to
permit such a comparison. In any event, and notwithstanding job creation
and real wage increases which have been achieved since 1968, the Government
is determined to make additional efforts to overcome the regional and sec-
toral concentrations of poverty which characterize the Brazilian economy.
Here the Government regards as crucially important the fact that its own
propensity to save increases with the pace of economic growth. This is
because the tax structure -- its incidence concentrated in the industrial
sector, Brazil's growth leiader -- is highly elastic to changes in GDP
while current expenditures are not. Much of the public sector savings
generated at high rates of growth are being used to finance programs of
great social significance. One of these is the program to reform and
expand the educational strueture. Another is the housing program which,
in addition to resettling urban slum dwellers, has created an enormous
amount of employment. Still other programs are designed to expand potable
water and sewerage facilities, to improve nutrition, and to better the
medical facilities available to both urban and rural workers through the
social security system.

14.       The most difficult of the Government's social programs is its
Northeast regional development effort funded by tax sharing and invest-
ment tax credit mechanisms which directly transfer about 5 percent of
Brazil's total domestic savings to the Northeast from the relatively
affluent Center-South. Through this program, Brazil has been a world
leader in the innovation of transfer mechanisms designed to redress
regional imbalances in the distribution of income. These mechanisms
have been in existence for some time but their impact became really
significant only with the tremendous improvement in taxing power
effected in the mid-1960's. Moreover, until 1970, resources transferred
were concentrated on the industrialization of the Northeast. While this
enabled the overall growth of the Northeast economy to keep pace with
that of the rest of the country -- it had very sparse direct employment
effects. In 1970 and 1971 the Government restructured its Northeast
development effort, channelling about half of the resource transfers to
that region into rural development programs designed to:
a) redistribute land in the Northeast;
b)  equip Northeast farmers with the information and technical
inputs needed to improve their low productivity;
c) reorganize and reequip the inefficient but very important
Northeast sugar industry; and
d) resettle Northeast farmers -- as well as farmers from
other poor regions of the country -- on hitherto unexploited
land on the western margin of the Northeast and in the Amazon.
15.       These new rural development programs are only just now getting
underway on a significant scale. Given the need to coordinate Brazil's
various regional development agencies and to study carefully the impli-
cations of regional development goals -- particularly for the ecology
of the Amazon -- it will take time before results become highly visible.
Nevertheless, the effort which the Government is making remains a very
clear indication of its earnest desire to bring the benefits of develop-
ment to all the inhabitants of Brazil.

BANK LENDING S'ThATEGY IN RAZIL
(Extract from Report and Recotmen&dation of the President to the Mcecutive
Directors on a proposed loan to Light    Servicos de ELetricidade, S.A.
for a Power Distribution and Sub-Transmission Project)
16.       The Bank's lendang strategy in Brazll is designed to support
in many ways the Government's development efforts. One important objec-
tive of the Bank's support (and which is especially important in lending
for power) is to help provide the necessary long-term external capital.
In this regard, the Bank seeks to play a conplementary role to that of
other lenders, supplementing their resources in individual operations
and financing activities that they are unwilling to finance. Brazil
has needed and will continue to need a very large volume of medium- and
long-term loan capital inrlows to sustain rapid growth and achieve its
employment creation and regional development objectives. As emphasized
earlier, the fact that it has accumulated large amounts of foreign
reserves in recent years by no means contradicts this. These reserves
have been accumulated because of the large volume of external financial
credits directed to Brazil and are necessary to maintain an adequate
degree of external liquicity,  Without this reserve cushion Brazil's very
high overall debt service ratio would make it highly susceptible to ex-
ternal liquidity problem.s and to the kind of 'stop-and-go" development
experienced in the 1960's.
17.       Another important objective of the Bank's lending strategy in
Brazil is to support adequate sector planning, institutional development
and policy reform, designed inter alia to ensure that puolic savings re-
sources are used economically and `=at an adequate volume of savings is
left available for application in the social sectors. This aspect of
our lending strategy is especially important in our lending in the trans-
portation sector.
18.       The Banik has also been helping to ease the foreign exchange
constraint on Brazilian development by supporting projects designed to
increase Brazil's export capacity and to substitute -- on an economic
basis -- imports. The recently approved livestock project will help
provide the technological base for expansion of Brazil's livestock
exports, an area in whiclh it has considerable comparative advantage.
Support of Brazil's steeL industry is helping to maintain Brazilian
self-sufficiency in a conmmodity which can be produced efficiently in
Brazil owing to that cowutry's bountiful supply of high grade iron ore
and the scale of its internal market.
19.       The Bank is also making efforts to lend increasingly for
projects which will help alleviate human misery, improve the equality
of economic opportunity and increase incomes in the lowest brackets.
It has supported Brazil.s education, water and sewerage and land settle-
ment programs; further support for these programs is under active pre-
paration. In addition wa are seeking to identify new opportunities to



ANNEX I
Page 9 of 9
support small scale farming, low cost urban housing, mass urban transport,
and improved nutrition. However, such projects not only are hard to
identify but in many cases are small in magnitude. Moreover, when iden-
tified, such projects equally attract the interest of other development
lenders. It is, therefore, likely that, despite our efforts, only a
limited number of projects in these areas will be available and suitable
for Bank finance in the near future, and that for some time projects of
this kind will constitute only a fraction of total Bank lending to Brazil.
20.       The Bank is also trying to help Brazil in analyzing the social
impact of its development strategy. Bank missions have exchanged views
with the Government on such subjects as the effects of Government policies
on income distribution and regional growth, the impact of payroll taxation
on labor absorption, the capacity of local governments to absorb additional
federal revenue transfers, the cost of domestically produced fertilizer,
and the distribution of agricultural credit. These discussions have helped
to clarify the links between rapid economic growth and human welfare.

403/47h   Estreito HydroeLectric Project:   US$57 and US$39 million
loans of Feru      26, 1965 and Decebe'19, l966; Clo_0sing
Date:  June 30    9.    The project is proceeding on sce ule,
Equipment costs were substantially below estimates, so that
disbursements have been less than forecast. The original
closing date was April 1, 1971.
404       Xavantes Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.5 million loan of
Feruar             Closing Date: December 3, 1973        e
projec  was completed in early 1971 (after a delay of about
eighteen months) except for the installation of equipment
for an associated transmission line. Ordering of this equip-
ment was delayed, and the loan is now expected to be fully
disbursed by December 31, 1973, four years after the initial
closing date. The original closing date was December 31, 1969,
postponed to December 31, 1971, and further postponed to
February 29, 1972.
442       Jaguara Hydroelectric Project:   US$49 million loan of
Marc 15, 1     ; Closing Date:  Dec      3            l the
four generators were commissioned during 1971 and the project
has been completed. Disbursements will extend up to the end
of 1974 primarily because equipment originally defective
has made necessary a postponement of the last payments to
suppliers. The original closing date was April 30, 1971,
postponed to April 30, 1973.
475/476/
477/478   Power Distribution Projects:   US$6.2  US$8.1 and US$1 million
loans of December 19, 96;Cosing sae for Loans 475 an47:

Ths      owrdstribut  i~on projects  ad aslow start but after
administrative reorganization in 1970 they gained momentum.
Procurement for the projects has been completed and all equip-
ment will be delivered by middle-1973. Most of the overhead
distribution system has been completed; construction work on
transmission lines, substations and underground distribution
systems will extend into 1973. The original closing dates
were December 31, 1970, postponed to December 31, 1973.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regardinig the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remed
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weakness in project execution.

Loan No.
516       Livestock Project:  US$hO million loan of September 23, 1967;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973. After initial delays due
to marketing and organizational difficulties, the livestock
credit program has been proceeding at a satisfactory rate.
Some problems arose in early 1972 with respect to the calcu-
lation of interest on ILndexed principal amounts during the
grace period but these have now been settled. The loan is
fully committed and disbursements are expected to be completed
by the closing date, December 31, 1973.
565       Porto Colombia Hydroelectric Project:   US$22.3 million loan  of
October 23, 1966; Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Changes in
the project layout and design have increased substantially the
local cost, which will be covered by ELETROBRAS. Construction
work is well advanced and the project is likely to be completed
on schedule.
566       Volta Grande Hydroelectric Project:   US$26.6 million loan of
October 23, 1960; Closing Date: January 31, 1975. The project
was delayed six months by spillway foundation difficulties.
Powerhouse construction cost estimates have increased by 72 per-
cent due to additional work resulting from foundation difficulties
and price escalation greater than estimated but, as the original
cost was very low, the resulting cost per Wh is still attractive.
No financial difficulty is expected for the company as a result
of the overruns.  The project is now two-thirds completed and the
first generating unit is expected to be in operation in February
1974.
567       First Highway Construction Project:   US$26 million loan of
October 23, 1965; Closing Date: March 31, 1973.    The First
Highway Construction project is completed at a cost slightly
below estimates. The closing date for the loan was postponed
from December 31, 1972, to March 31, 1973, but the Government
has yet to submit its final, small disbursement request. The
Government has proposed several related additions to the project
which would utilize the expected unexpended loan balance of about
US$3.1 million. The proposals are now being considered in the
Bank.
656       Industry:  US$25 million of February 16, 1970 to Banco do
Nordeste do Brasil (BNB); Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
Commitments of the loan by BNB have continued to be slow.
About half of the loan has now been committed, and the closing
date for submission for sub-projects, which was postponed a
year to June 30, 1973, may be postponed a second time to give
ENB an opportunity to submit sub-projects in an advanced stage
of preparation. Slow utilization of the loan has been due

mainly to BNB's unusually burdensome security conditions on
subloans and its emphasis on larger-scale projects, for which
financing from other than World Bank funds has been available.
BNB has not been responsive to Bank encouragement to modify
these policies.
676       Second Highw    Construction Project:  US$100 million loar of'
May 25, 1970; Closing Date: _Jul   31, 197_. Construction
works are well underway and the overall quality of construction
and supervision i.s satisfactory. There have been cost increases
on and delays in the execution of several contracts due to
inclement weather and design changes, but the total project cost
is still estimated to be within the appraisal estimate includ-
ing contingencies, and it is expected that all construction
works will be completed before the closing date for the loan.
Disbursements undcer the loan are slightly behind the appraisal
schedule due to the above delays, but have improved during the
last year.
677       Marimbondo Hydroe!lectric Project:  US$70 million loan of
April 5, 1971; Clos ng Date:  May 31, 1977.   Construction
work is proceeding on schedule. The cost of increased exca-
vation and concrete work resulting from poor rock foundation
is expected to be mostly offset by a reduction in earth fill
work. A US$26 million overrun, caused by equipment prices
higher than estimated and additional transmission facilities,
was covered by a loan from a commercial bank.
728       Salto Osorio Hydroelectric Project:   US$70 million loan of
Closing Date: May 31, 1977.   The construction
of the Salto Osorio hydroelectric plant is progressing satis-
factorily and no cost overrun is foreseen at this time.
The construction of the transmission system -- delayed to
allow a reexamination of ELETROSUL's market in light of
revised demand projections in the South of Brazil, possible
new power sales in the Southeast region and the addition of
heretofore unscheduled generating capacity -- is now about
to proceed as originally defined. The Government has
decided to revise the timing and scope of other generation
additions in the South and Southeast, and the Congress is
considering recently submitted legislation requiring the
updating of long-term plans for the integrated development
of generation ancd major transmission systems for each region.

755       Education Project:  US$8.4 million loan of June 21, 1971;
Closig Date: December 31, 1975. Progress on the construction
and equipment of the project schools is proceeding in accordance
with the revised schedule agreed upon in September 1972.
756       Santos Port Project:  US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976. The overall port investment
program at Santos was recently expanded to accomodate increased
exports under the Government's "export corridors" program. Cost
estimates for the Bank-financed project increased from US$78.5
million to US$108.1 million, reflecting worse-than-foreseen soil
and construction conditions, higher than initially estimated
costs for completing new railway connections, and Bank-approved
increases in the size of project dredging equipment and the corn
silo. Review of the scope and economic justification of the
project by the Bank and the Borrower has tentatively identified
areas in which major savings in project costs may be achieved.
Preparation of tender documents is nearing completion but,
pending completion of the above review, tenders for civil works
and equipment for the corn and container terminals and rail
access thereto, have not been asked. Satisfactory progreIss,
assisted by management consultants, has been made in improving
port operations at Santos. However, the plan being prepared
for the reorganization of the National Department of Ports and
Navigable Waterways does not yet provide satisfactory solutions
to the problems of low salary scales, and the Bank has recommended
the final plan be modified. The consulting contract for the
National Port Development Study was awarded in May 1973.
757       Sao Paulo Water Supply Project:  US$22 million loan of
June 21, 1971- Closing Date: June 30, 1975. The project
suffered initial delays caused by the State of Sao Paulo not
furnishing the required counterpart funds. The required funds
are now included in the state budget and the project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily.
758       Sao Paulo Pollution Control Project:   US$15 million loan of
June 21, 1971; Closimng Date: June 30, 1975. The original project
desgn included the pumping of untreated sewage into an area reser-
voir representing a major source of water and serving as an impor-
tant recreational facility for the Sao Paulo area. Earlier studies
had shown that the reservoir could absorb the organic pollution
without damage for some time. Area residents, however, objected to
this solution and subsequent technical review questioned the initial
judgment that no ecological harm would be caused. As a result, the
original design is being modified to exclude the discharge of raw
savage and include a treatment facility. BLdding procedures are in
progress for other portions of the project.

Closing Date-   SEp    er 30, 197h. A delay of about six months
occurred in awarding the contracts for constructing the new rail-
way link for the MBR iron ore mine due to engineering problems
encountered and inadequate project management by the Federal
Railways. Work on site is now proceeding at a rapid pace, and
much of the lost time is being regained such that the project
should be sufficiently completed to allow new ore traffic to
commence by, or Soon after, the planned completion date of
