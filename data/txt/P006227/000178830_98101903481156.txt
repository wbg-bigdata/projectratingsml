THE ESTREITO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Summary
i.        Central Eletrica de Furnas S.A. (Furnas) has applied to the Bank
for a loan of US$57 million equivalent, including US$9 million for interest
during construction to help finance the first stage of the Estreito hydro-
electric project. The project is estimated to cost US$90.5 million equiva-
lent including interest during construction on the proposed Bank loan.
ii.       Furnas, a corporation owned principally by the Federal Government,
is now completing the construction of the 900 M4W Furnas hydroelectric project
which was financed in part by Loan 211-BR dated October 3, 1958 of US$73
million.
iii.      The first stage of the Estreito project consists of an embankment
type dam and a powerhouse with an initial capacity of 533 MW and transmission
facilities to connect to the existing transmission system serving Rio de
Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte and environs. The project is technically
sound and economically justified.
iv.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be used mainly to finance
the purchase of equipment for the project, which would be supplied partly by
foreigp and partly by local suppliers. Awards would be made after international
competitive bidding with participation by qualified domestic suppliers who
would be granted a 15% preference.
v.        Furnas has completed revaluing its balance sheet accounts through
the year 1963 as prescribed by recent decrees which permit revaluation of
historical cost investments for tariff making purposes. Furnas expects to
further revalue its accounts for the year 1964 at about mid-1965. Tariff
increases have been applied for which will enable Furnas to currently achieve
a rate of return of not less than 10% of its revalued net fixed assets in
operation. Loan covenants have been agreed upon to assure that a proper level
of earnings will be maintained in the future and a tariff increase is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
vi.       The project is suitable for a loan of US$57 million equivalent
for a term of 25 years including about a six and one half year grace period.



BRAZIL
THE ESTRETrO HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        Central Eletrica de Furnas S.A. (Furnas), a corporation owmed prin-
cipally by the Federal Government, has applied to the Bank for a loan of
US$57 million equivalent including US$9 million of interest during construction
to help finance the first stage of the Estreito hydroelectric project. This
project is to be built on the Rio Grande about 500 km. northwest of Rio de
Janeiro at an estimated cost of US$81.5 million equivalent (excluding interest
during construction). The first stage would include an embankment type dam
and a powerhouse with an installed capacity of 533 IW which would be connected
to the existing transmission system serving the cities of Rio de Janeiro, Sao
Paulo, Belo Horizonte and environs.
2.        Furnas is now completing the construction, on the same river, of
the 900 MW Furnas hydroelectric project which was financed in part by Bank
Loan 211-BR, dated October 3, 1958, of US$73 million. The Estreito project
is of high priority in a program of power expansion for the south-central
region of Brazil. This program was prepared under a United Nations Special
Fund grant for which the Bank is the executing agency.
3.        This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission which visited
Brazil in August-September 1964.
II. THE BORROWER
4.        Furnas is a mixed public-private corporation which was formed in
1957. It is a subsidiary of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras),
a Federal Government limited liability company created in 1961 to carry out
a national electrification plan. It was granted a 30-year concession to con-
struct and operate the Furnas project and in 1962 was given a similar authority
covering the Estreito project.
5.        Total share capital as of December 1, 1964 was Cr.$25 billion divided
equally between common and preferred shares. The shareholders and their pre-
sent participations are as follows:
Common Stock   Preferred Stock
Eletrobras                                     89.8%           81.2%
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A.
(Cemig) (A State company)                     4.6%           4.6%
Departamento de Aguas e Energia Eletrica
de Sao Paulo (A State company)                5.6%            7.0%
Sao Paulo Light Company controlled by
Brazilian Traction of Canada                                  5.0%
Cia Paulista de Forca e Luz of Eletrobras
(formerly American and Foreign Power)                         o.6%
Cia Hidreletrica do Rio Pardo of the State
of Sao Paulo                                                  1.6%
______          100%

Action is being taken to revalue assets in accordance with recent legislation
and to convert Eletrobras loans to equity0 As a result, the capitalization
will be increased and Eletrobrast share will become larger.
6.        The by-laws of the company stipulate that the electricity produced
will be sold only to the above shareholders and that 50% of the output will
go into the State of Sao Paulo, and 50% to Minas Gerais, but subject to ad-
justment if needed. At present, the State of Mlinas Gerais has temporarily
waived its rights, to allow all the power output to go to Sao Paulo which badly
needs it on account of drought conditions. Furnas and the Sao Paulo Light Co0
are presently operating under a letter of intent which covers only the general
provisions of a sales contract0 This arrangement is temporarily satisfactory
but as the power supply becomes more adequate, as planned for 1970, long-term
sales contracts both for Furnas and the many other electric power producers
connected to the same system will have to be negotiated and formalized0 The
Government has recognized this inadequacy and has agreed to encourage the
effective coordination of the operation of all the elements of the system by
1970.
7.        The Board of Directors consists of a president, a vice-president
acting as technical director, a vice-president acting as financial director,
and three other directors without specific duties0 Of the latter, one is also
vice-president of Cemig, one a vice-president of Sao Paulo Light, and one a
former director of the Sao Paulo Department of WhTaters and Electric Power. The
organization at the managerial level is aggressive and competent. The total
staff includes 80 engineers and 2,500 others, a large portion of whom are in-
volved in the construction of the Furnas projecto The staff lacks sufficient
qualified employees in some departments, but consultants and engineering firms
are regularly employed on important work for which staff is inadequateo A
small part of the proceeds of the proposed loan would be used to train
employees0
8.        The facilities of the company (see 1Map) include the Furnas hydro-
electric plant with a large reservoir and a powerhouse with four 150 IMW units
already in service and two more of the same size now being erected which will
be in service by June 1965, for a total of 900 M.0 The plant is connected to
the Cemig system by a 345-kv line 265 km. long; and to the Sao Paulo and Rio
systems via Sao Paulo by a 345-kv line 314 km. long. A second 345-kv line
along the latter route is under construction0 Construction will be started
soon on a 345-kv line from the plant direct to Rio de Janeiro. The plant has
been operated efficiently and at the peak of its capability since the first
unit was brought into service late in 1963.
9.        Inflation in Brazil has had a profound effect on utility earnings
and operations. It has also made past operating results difficult to interpret
and made necessary the continuing review of construction estimates. For this
reason the following measures are used in this report. Forecasts of operating
results are given in cruzeiros based on an estimated 1964 average exchange rate
of Cr.$1,500 to US$1.000 The project cost estimate is given in U.S0 dollars
equivalent in order to simplify its use0 Continued inflation is expected, al-
though the Government aims to reduce it, and this must be taken into account
in future use of the estimates0

III. POWER M4ARKET AND POWER SUPPLY
10.       The south-central region of Brazil (containing the cities of Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte) is the industrial heart of the
country (see M4ap). It contains 43% of the population and is responsible for
76% of the country's industrial activity. Industrial growth was rapid from
1940 to 1962 and in the latter year industry was using 76% of all the electric
power produced. The demand for energy at the generation level over the past
ten years was as follows:
Millions
Year                    of kwh                   % Growth
1955                     9,294
1956                    10,507                     13.0
1957                    11,561                     10.0
1958                    12,977                     12.2
1959                    14,149                      9.0
1960                    15,633                     10.5
1961                    17,042                      9.0
1962                    18,917                     11.0
1963                    19,715                      4.2
1964 (estimate)         20,957                      6.3
A severe drought began in 1963 and the supply was curtailed by rationing, which
was continued into 1964 although in the latter year there was some relief due
to new generating facilities becoming available. Also during these last two
years business was sluggish but it is expected to recover soon.
11.       The market for electrical energy in the region has been studied in-
tensively over the past two years by a consortium of foreign engineering firms
called Canambra which is working under the United Nations Special Fund grant
mentioned above in paragraph 2. Market forecasts through 1970 have been made
which are revised from time to time. Using all of Canambra's basic data avail-
able through August 1964, a forecast has been prepared on the assumption that
drought conditions will decrease in severity in 1965 and 1966 and that business
should return by 1967 to the level of activity which existed prior to 1963.
The forecast of demand at the generation level is as follows:
Millions
Year                    of kwh                   % Growth
1964                    20,957
1965                    23,053                     10
1966                    25,358                     10
1967                    28,147                     11
1968                    31,243                     11
1969                    34,679                     11
1970                    38,)493                    11



12.       The electricity supply of the region comes from a large number of
plants which have been built with Federal, State, or private funds without much
coordination. The plants are predominantly hydroelectric because fossil fuels
are scarce in Brazil and because the region is endowed with hydrologic and
topographic conditions which are favorable for hydro developments. The plants,
which have a total installed capacity of about 4,400 194, are owned and operated
as follows:
Capacity in 1964
Company & Principal Ownership                       Hydro MW     Thermal MW
Rio Light, Brazilian Traction                         831            25

Grand Total                                      4,395
13.       Canambra has prepared a short-term program for the expansion of the
power supply to meet the demand through 1970. This includes additional units
being installed in four existing hydro plants, nine new hydro plants and two
thermal plants now under construction, and two new hydro plants which were
selected after a study of thirteen projects which could be started in the near
future. The study also covered new thermal generation but there is so much
hydro potential available at low costs that additional thermal capacity will
not be economically desirable for years to come.
14.       The studies show that energy requirements, which are predicated on
available water rather than installed machine capacity, are of prime importance
through 1970 and consequently the program is based on the firm energy capability
of the various plants in the driest period of record. The following tabulation
shows existing capability, and that of plants under construction and new plants
to be completed by 1970. Furnas is expected to contribute from its existing
Furnas and proposed Estreito hydro plants about 18% of the estimated require-
ments in 1970.



-5-
Firm Capability
Plant                                                 Millions of Kwh/year
Existing hydro 1964 (includes new plants
completed during the year)                                  16, 150
Existing thermal 1964                                           4,550
Hydro under construction (including Chavantes
and expansion of plants)                                     14,000
Thermal under construction                                      1,340
Estreito hydro, construction to start 1965                      3,240
Jaguara hydro, construction to start 1965                      2,400
Total in 1970                                        41,680
Therefore, if all the systems were integrated by 1970, the energy capability
of the system would be able to meet the demand for that year with about 8½%
reserve. As indicated in Annex 1, the demand would also be met in intervening
years, but with smaller reserve capability in some years.
15.       The program includes the additions to the existing transmission grid
necessary to connect the new generating facilities and to integrate all plants
into a fully dependable system. Financing and construction of the needed
'tY%hajission is currently keeping abreast of the new generating facilities as
they core into operation. Arrangements for expanding the distribution systems
have noti-vet been made. Many of these, particularly in Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo, are 1now at the saturation point principally because the private capital
companies wh ) are the principal distributors have not been allowed to earn
sufficient iniome to expand the systems and Government funds have not been
available to , hem.  It is essential that the improvement of the distribution
systems be sta.,ted soon if the expansion program is to meet the demand as
plarmed.  On tlae basis of tariff regulations recently issued (see paragraph
36), the Gove.fnment has agreed to grant to the distribution companies increases
in tariffs whi   should enable them to finance a substantial portion of the
cost of the expar sion of the facilities.  Specific arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank for th   expansion of the distribution facilities in the Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Pa  o areas are a condition of effectiveness in the proposed
Loan Agreement.
16.       The success of the program will depend vitally on whether the numerous
operating entities und'er a variety of ownerships can agree on sound policies
of load dispatching, stndby arrangements, and other problems of integrated
operation; and will set up an organization to carry out the policies. Nothing
has been done about this\ and under Brazilian conditions, it promises to be
difficult to achieve. As\noted above in paragraph 6, the Government has
agreed to encourage the effective coordination of all elements of the system
by 1970.
17.       The program is estimated to cost about US$1.3 billion equivalent
through 1970, made up as follows:"



-6-
Yillions of dollars
Equivalent
Hydro plants under construction                    425
Thermal plants under construction                   35
New hydro construction                             140
Transmission and substations                       440
Distribution                                       260
1,300
Furnas' capital expenditures toward this program will consist of about US$182
million equivalent or about 13% of the program (see paragraph 49). The program
is sound providing the conditions noted above in paragraph 15 and 16 can be
met. The Estreito project is the first choice for the new hydro construction
on the basis of having the lowest unit costs per kw and per kwh.
IV. THE PROJECT
18.       the Estreito project will be situated on the Rio Grande which forms
the boundary between the States of Ninas Gerais and Sao Paulo. The site is
160 km. downstream from the Furnas project and 60 km. downstream from the
Peixoto project, a 180 M4W hydro plant built by American and Foreign Power Corp.
Furnas has a reservoir large enough to regulate the flow throughout the dry
spells of several years duration which are characteristic of this region, and
there will be large resulting benefits to the Estreito and Peixoto projects.
19.       The first stage of the project, to which the loan application relates,
consists of the construction of a rockfill dam with a central earth core, about
500 meters long and 80 meters high, with a volume of 3.5 million cubic meters,
a concrete intake structure and powerhouse on the left bank, a concrete spill-
way on the right bank, and the transmission facilities necessary to connect
to the existing transmission network.
20.       The powerhouse will be designed to contain six generating units of
which four will be installed in the first stage, while the date for installation
of the fifth and sixth has not yet been determined. The generating units will
have a capacity of 133 TV each with Francis type turbines to operate under a
normal head of 66 meters. Transmission facilities will be at 345-kv and will
consist of one line 140 km. long to Furnas and one line 35 km. long to Peixoto.
21.       The Brazilian subsidiary of International Engineering Co. of San
Francisco, California, has made the preliminary studies of the project and is
now working on the detailed plans and specifications for the dam and powerhouse.
Geological explorations by International have revealed good rock foundations
for all of the concrete structures and adequate earth and rock for the dam at
close range. Fxtensive rainfall and stream flow studies based on thirty years
of record have indicated a spillway capacity requirement of about 13,000 m3 /sec.



-7-
There is no silt problem by reason of the upstream reservoirs. The trans-
mission facilities have been designed by Ebasco Services, Inc. The Furnas
organization will do its own construction supervision and operate the com-
pleted project.
22.       Preliminary work on access roads and housing at the site has been
started. Plans and specifications for a civil works contract will be available
early in 1965. If work under such a contract can szart by the end of June
1965 the project can be completed in early 1971. The work will be protected
against interruption by possible floods by reason of the Furnas reservoir
upstream.
23.       The estimated cost of the project including interest during con-
struction on the Bank loan amounts to US$90.5 million equivalent. The follow-
ing breakdown between local and foreign costs is based on the Borrower's
expectation of the probable outcome of international bidding with Brazilian
suppliers participating.

24.       The local currency cost estimate was prepared in dollars, as is often
done in Brazil, to provide a reasonably firm basis for camparison with actual
costs as they are incurred. As will be described in the financial section of
this report, increased local costs caused by inflation and which are difficult
to predict, are expected to be compensated by (a) corresponding increases of
Furnas' internal resources, due to periodic revaluations of assets and corres-
ponding tariff adjustments (see paragraph 38) and (b) the expected Government
undertakings to provide all necessary funds to carry out Furnas' expansion
(see paragraph 54).
25.       The cost estimates were prepared by the Furnas engineering and pur-
chasing groups which have a good record for accuracy on the Furnas project
estimates. The contingency allowance includes 15% on civil works and 729 on
other items. The allowance should be adequate in this case since the site will
be protected from floods. The cost per kilowatt is US$130 not including trans-
mission costs, which is very low for a hydroelectric development. The first
scage of the project as described in paragraphs 19 and 20, does not include
adequate transmission facilities for the entire output. Since the necessary
f:acilities can be built in less time than the hydroelectric plant, Furnas in-
tends to defer construction of them to a second stage, which will be started
in about two years and will consist of transmission lines and substations
costing Us$53 million. This high cost is due to the fact that the lines will
not only carry all of Estreito's output, but also that of the Jaguara project
which Cemig plans to start building downstream from Estreito in 1965. Further-
more, it will provide duplicate facilities in the final system to meet reli-
ability requirements. A covenant has been included in both the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements that both Estreito stages will be completed by early
1971 (see paragraph 54).
26.       The proposed loan is intended to cover those materials and equipment
which will be procured under international competitive bidding and imported
construction equipment consisting principally of spare parts for equipment al-
ready owned by Furnas for which international competition is impractical.
These items are estimated to cost US$48 million plus interest during con-
struction estimated at US$9 million for a total loan of US$57 million. Costs
not covered by the proposed loan are those for civil works contracts, materials
such as cement, sand and gravel, etc., and small vehicles which are to be
procured locally. (See Annex 5 for details).
27.       Furnas has asked for and received 14 proposals from firms operating
in Brazil for prequalification for bidding on the civil works contracts. One
of the requirements was that local bidders should have pertinent construction
experience in Brazil. Although examination of the proposals has not been com-
pleted, Furnas believes nine of them will probably be acceptable. After
specific discussions, the Bank has agreed that it would not be necessary for
Furnas to modify its proposed procedures to a more formal procedure of inter-
national bidding. The reasons for this are: that there is a well-developed
and capable construction industry in Brazil; that a foreign contractor not al-
ready established would be likely to encounter difficulties doing business
under the peculiar Brazilian economic conditions; and that many of the firms
likely to qualify under the Furnas invitation are in fact consortia of firms
including foreign contractors.

V. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEDENT
28.       Local firms will compete for many of the contracts covering materi-
als and equipment to be financed by the proposed loan. While Government-owned
power companies are exempt from customs duties and the exchange surcharge and
compulsory deposits mentioned below, current Brazilian legislation (Law of
Similares) as interpreted by the Superintendency of Money and Credits (SUMOC),
prohibits generally the importation of capital goods which can be produced
locally. This matter has been discussed and the Government and Furnas have
agreed to international competitive bidding on goods to be financed under the
proposed loan; and the Government has agreed to take all such measures as nec-
essary to facilitate the importation of goods by Furnas free from all legal
and administrative restrictions or limitations in accordance with the arrange-
ments described below.
29.       In comparing bids by foreign and local suppliers it will be necessary
to determine the exchange rate which is to be used. At the present time the
cost of exchange to importers is generally determined by the following:
(1) the commercial bank rate of exchange which is close to the official rate
of exchange of the Banco do Brasil, (2) the prevailing exchange surcharge,
presently 10%, and (3) compulsory deposits, presently 50% of the transaction,
for 7 months. The Bank and the Government have agreed that the exchange rate
to be used for evaluating bids and calculating the amount to be disbursed from
the loan would be the prevailing commercial rate plus the exchange surcharge
(not to exceed 30%). The exchange rate derived from this formula would rough-
ly approximate the average between the effective import and export rates, and
thus should provide a reasonably fair basis for bid comparisons. In the event
of significant changes in the exchange system, the parties would reconsider
this formula.
30.       A further matter raised by the Government concerns the protection
which should be afforded to local industry. On this point, discussions led
to the agreement that the maximum protection would be 15%.
31.       On the basis described above, the procedure for comparing local and
foreign bids and making disbursements covering contracts obtained by local
bidders would be as follows: (1) a local bid in cruzeiros will be converted
into dollars at the rate of exchange described in paragraph 29 above; (2) the
lowest local bidder will be awarded the contract if his evaluated bid is less
than the lowest evaluated foreign bid, plus 15%; and (3) dollar reimbursements
from the loan for such local expenditures will in principle be computed at the
rate described in paragraph 29 above. However, inasmuch as such reimbursements
will have to be converted into cruzeiros at the prevailing Banco do Brasil rate
of exchange, this may cause a shortage of cruzeiros to the Borrower approxi-
mately equal to the amount of the exchange surcharge. The Government has agreed
to cover such cruzeiro shortages. For administrative convenience in making
disbursements from the loan in respect of cruzeiro expenditures the Bank has
agreed to establish from time to time a common disbursement percentage based
on the relationship between the Banco do Brasil rate at which loan funds can
be converted (presently Cr$1825 = Us$1), and the exchange rate used for bid
comparisons (presently Cr$2035   US$1).  Accordingly, a 90% rate has been estab-
lished for the time being.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
32.       The regulations governing power operations and tariffs are contained
in the Water Code of 1934 and subsequent amendments and decrees, including,
in particular a decree dated February 26, 1957 and three decrees dated Nov-
ember 4, 1964. The Water Division of the Ministry of Mines and Energy is
responsible for implementation of the Water Code, including the granting and
supervision of concession contracts and the review and approval of tariff
applications.
33.       Under the regulations which have applied until recently, tariffs
were to be reviewed every three years to yield revenues which would cover:
(a) all operating costs; (b) straight-line depreciation on the historic value
of gross plant in service, at annual rates prescribed by the Water Division,
presently up to 8% for thermal plants and up to 5% for all other facilities,
including hydro plants; (c) amortization of the total investment of the con-
cession at annual rates, determined in the concession contracts approved by
the Water Division, not to exceed 3%; (d) a cumulative return before income
taxes of 10% on the historic value of the remunerable investment (Furnas is
subject to 10% income tax on net profit). Remunerable investment is defined
as depreciated plant in service at year end, plus an allowance for working
capital consisting of actual cash, up to the amount of the depreciation reserve,
two month's billings and operating inventories.
34.       In addition, adjustments in the form of surcharges on the original
three-year tariff were permitted, subject to approval by the Water Division;
(a) semi-annually for increases in foreign debt service due to changes in
foreign exchange rates, (b) monthly for increases in compulsory wages, social
benefits, cost of fuel and purchased power.
35.       The rapid depreciation of the currency in recent years resulted in
the deterioration of the earnings and finances of utilities. Due to inadequate
implementation of the regulations and to delays in obtaining the permitted
adjustments, utilities have seldom been able to charge depreciation and invest-
ment amortization at the rates prescribed, let alone to earn the permitted 10%
return on investment. However, the fundamental shortcoming of this policy was
the use of historic values for computing the tariff base as these became a
fraction of what they would have been had the currency remained stable. Thus,
in real terms, returns on investment have been decreasing gradually and returns
on equity have become negligible; as a result, utilities have been unable to
generate funds internally towards financing expansion, or to raise outside
funds, except from the Federal or State Governments.
36.       The revaluation of assets for tariff making purposes has thus become
an essential condition of the financial soundness of utilities. This measure,
which had been expected to take place within months after the signing of Loan
211-BR in late 1958, but failed at the time to obtain Parliamentary approval,
has recently been enacted by two decrees defining the methods for revaluing
assets and amending the Water Code to allow tariffs to be determined on the
basis of corrected rather than historic values, starting January 1, 1965.



- .1 -
37.       The decree covering revaluation of assets is patterned after the pro-
visions of the existing legislation governing the revaluation of balance sheets
for all corporations other than utilities and government-controlled corporations.
It provides for the revaluation of balance sheet accounts, using official annual
correction factors based on cost of living indices published by the National
Economic Council. These factors are applied to plant in service, depreciation
and amortization reserves, foreign currency loans and local currency loans pro-
viding they had been obtained from the National Development Bank (BNDE) and
Eletrobras. Foreign currency components of the balance sheet accounts are con-
verted into local currency at the foreign rate of exchange at the times of
acquisition of such funds. The amount by which the revaluation of assets ex-
ceeds the revaluation of reserves and loans is set aside as a revaluation re-
serve. This reserve, which is subject to a 5% tax, has to be converted into
share capital within a four-month period.
38.       The decree governing tariffs allows the use of revalued fixed assets
as a basis for determining tariffs. In the future, revaluation of fixed assets
and corresponding tariff adjustments can be made every year as official cor-
rection factors are issued but this annual provision is not mandatory. These
adjustments will be subject to approval by the Water Division. The adjustments
for increases in operating costs, as described in paragraph 34, will be auto-
matic. The other provisions of the Water Code will be maintained. Thus, in
principle, depreciation and amortization of the concession investment could be
charged at the maximum rates that have been permissible until now partly to
offset inflation. This, however, would result in a combined allocation which
would exceed substantially the usually accepted level of depreciation charges;
it would thus call for a considerable increase in Furnas' future tariffs.
39.       The Government and Furnas have indicated they are prepared to increase
the tariffs of Furnas to this high level and to continue to use the maximum
permissible depreciation and amortization criteria at least during the construc-
tion period of the project. Furnas has just completed revaluing its fixed
assets in service based on the correction factors available through the year
1963. It has applied for tariffs which would provide revenues to cover, jinter
alia, depreciation at 5%, amortization of the concession investment at 3%, and
the 10% return on remunerable investment, revalued through 1963. The new tariff
would result in an average revenue per kwh of about Cr.$10 (u.s. mills 6.7),
almost twice the present estimated average of Cr.$5.1 (U.S. MIills 3.4). Inas-
much as such a tariff increase will slightly exceed the minimum tariff required
for 1965 as outlined in paragraph 41 below, it has been agreed that the proposed
tariff increase is acceptable and is to be put into effect before the effective
date of the proposed loan.
40.       As a second step, Furnas plans to further revalue its fixed assets
through the end of 1964, based on the correction factors to be published shortly
for 1964, and to apply for a new tariff adjustment which would be based on the
new values of its fixed assets and the same depreciation and amortization crite-
ria as outlined in paragraph 39. Furnas expects that this second adjustment
will be made effective by the middle of 1965.



- 12 -
41.       These maximum criteria reflect conditions which are presently
accepted by both Furnas and the Government. The high cash generation which
would result from using these criteria is reflected in Annex 6. It is not
likely that the Borrower will continue to apply these criteria indefinitely
since they call for unusually high tariffs. Therefore, in order that adequate
tariffs will be maintained, it has been agreed that Furnas' revenues will be
sufficient to cover all operating expenses including adequate maintenance and
straight line depreciation of 23g of the gross revalued fixed plant in opera-
tion and produce a return of not less than 10% of the total average net re-
valued fixed plant in operation. The agency responsible for the setting and
adjustment of tariffs will review the tariffs of Furnas as often as is nec-
essary in order to verify that future revenues are adequate. Cn this basis
a minimum tariff of at least Cr.$9.4 (U.S. Mills 6.3) per kwh should be in
effect starting in 1965 as outlined in the forecast income statements, Annex 2.
Past Earning Record
42.       The estimated income statement for 1964, Furnast first full year of
operation, is shown in Annex 2. It indicates that Furnas will earn a return
of 7.1% on its historic investment. The historic investment is already under-
stated as a result of inflation (see paragraph 45); this 7.1% return, however,
is after 5% depreciation and 3% amortization of the concession investment, in-
cluding compensation of exchange losses incurred in amortizing Loan 211-BR.
The total of these charges would be equivalent to about 2.5% of Furnas' revalued
plant in service, as estimated in paragraph 45. Furnas has just started opera-
tions and the value of its plant while already understated is not understated
as much as the plant value of utilities which have been in existence for a
number of years.
Present Financial Position
43.       Arthur Anderson and Co., a well-known accounting firm, have been
employed as outside auditors by Furnas since 1958 and these arrangements have
been satisfactory. Furnas has agreed to continue to employ outside auditors
acceptable to the Bank.
44.       Furnas' balance sheet as of December 31, 1964 has been estimated on
the basis of data available in September 1964. The proposed revaluation was
computed on the basis of official correction factors through 1963 and an esti-
mated correction factor of 1.6 for 1964, which resulted in an equivalent of
Cr.$1,500 to US$1. The financial projections have been maintained at this fixed
level because the future purchasing power of the cruzeiro is unpredictable. Most
of the effects of the decreasing purchasing power of the cruzeiro have been pro-
vided for under existing regulations by revaluations and tariff adjustments.

45.        As a result of revaluation, gross plant in service, and net
plant in service would increase about 3.6 times over their original values
to Cr.$283.4 billion and Cr.$271.7 billion respectively.
46.        Long-term debt obligations would increase from Cr.$50 billion
to Cr.$162 billion or about 3.3 times and equity would increase from Cr.$28
billion to Cr.$112 billion resulting in a debt/equity ratio of 59/41.
47.        Long-term debt includes IBRD Loan 211-BR of 1958 for an original
amount of US$73 million at 5-3/4% interest for a term of 25 years. Two
principal payments in 1964 have reduced the principal to about US$71 million
or Cr.$106.5 billion equivalent. The other long-term debt consists of three
15-year local currency loans, at 10% interest, which total about Cr.$56 billion
after revaluation. Principal payments began in 1964 on the first two loans
and the amortization of the third loan will commence in 1965.
48.        In September 1964 Furnas' share capital was very substantially
increased, from Cr.$6 billion to Cr.$25 billion, by conversion into shares
of about Cr.$18 billion of government loans, and about Cr.$l billion of
"interest" accrued during construction of the Furnas plant on the share
capital and neT cash. Share capital is divided equally between common and
preferred shares at Cr.41,000 par. Annual dividends have been paid at 6%
on common and at 10%' on preferred shares.  Eletrobras owns 89.8g of Furnas'
cornmon shares and 81.2 of its preferred shares (see paragraph 5). The net
results of the revaluation would be reflected in a revaluation reserve of
Cr.y78 billion which is to be converted into share capital in 1965 in the
same proportion as shares outstanding and will be subject to a 5% tax payable
in 1965.
Proposed Financing Plan
49.        A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the period
1964-1970 is shown in Annex 3. During this period Furnas contemplates com-
pleting (1) the Furnas generating plant to its full complement of six units
in 1965; (2) the Furnas transmission system by 1967; (3) the Estreito first
stage hydro project, as described in paragraphs 19 and 20, to be partly
financed by the proposed Bank loan; and (4) the Estreito second stage
transmission project, as described in para-iaph 25. Both stages of Estreito
are to be finished in 1971.
50.        Construction requirements and additions to working capital
during this seven-year period are estimated at about Cr.$299 billion, inclu-
ding plant additions of Cr.$273 billion and working capital requirements
of about Cr.$26 billion as follows:

52.       Based on data available in September 1964, outstanding balances on
existing loans and borrowings from foreign sources contemplated during the
period would amount to about Cr.$175.2 billion equivalent, out of the total
Cr.$298.7 billion required, as detailed below:
(a)  The outstanding balances at the end of 1963, of about Cr.$8.0 billion
equivalent under IBRD Loan 211-BR and about Cr.$8.2 billion under
an existing BNDE Loan, would be fully disbursed in 1964 to complete
the Furnas plant.
(b) A U.S. AID Loan of US$17.6 million (Cr.$26.4 billion equivalent) was
obtained in October 1964 to finance part of the Furnas transmission
system; it will carry interest at X   and a term of 20 years, in-
cluding a three-year grace period. Completion of the Furnas trans-
mission project is a requirement of the proposed Estreito Loan
Agreement.
(c) The proposed IBRD Loan of US$57 million (Cr.$85.6 billion equivalent)
for the first stage of the Estreito project, was assumed to carry
interest at 5-19 and a term of 25 years, including a six and one
half year grace period.
(d)  A foreign loan of US$31.3 million (Cr.$47.0 billion equivalent)
is expected to be obtained in 1966 for financing a part of the
Estreito second stage project, to be undertaken at that time; terms
similar to those of the proposed IBRD loan above have been assumed.
53.       The Cr.$123.5 billion balance between the requirements and the
borrowings described above would have to be obtained locally. This amount
which is expressed in cruzeiros at current price levels, is expected to
increase as a result of inflation and the "cruzeiro exchange gap" described
in paragraph 31. However, most of the increase would be compensated by
corresponding increases in Furnas' internal cash generation, due to tariff
adjustmients reflecting periodic revaluation of fixed assets, and in the funds
to be supplied by Eletrobras.
54.       The proportion in which the local currency requirements would be
contributed from internal cash generation or by local loans from Eletrobras
can only be determined when and as future tariffs of Furnas are established.
If the minimum tariff criteria as outlined in paragraph 41 are used, it would
permit Furnas to finance from its own internal sources about Cr.$62 billion
toward the requirements of the period. This would be after payment of its
debt service and by deferring any payment of cash dividends during 1965
through 1968. The balance of the requirements of about Cr.$61.5 billion
would have to come from Eletrobras (excluding the Cr.$8.2 billion balance
of the existing BNDE Loan mentioned in paragraph 52 (a).  About Cr.$46.5
billion of the Cr.$61.5 billion would be for the local currency cost of the
Estreito first stage and Furnas transmission projects. The remainder or
Cr.$15 billion would have to be obtained starting in 1966 in connection with
the Estreito Second Stage project. In this report, it has been assumed that



- 17 -
the necessary local financing will be in the form of BND.L loans at l%
interest and for a term of 20 years, including three years grace. The Bank
has received assurances from the Government that all the funds necessary
will be made available to Furnas to complete all of the projects. Furnas has
also indicated that it intends to exceed the minimum requirements of the
tariff criteria at least to the extent of paying cash dividends during the
construction period.
55.       In order to assure that Furnas will maintain a sound financial
position, it has been agreed that an annual assets test is necessary which
would limit Furnas' long term debt outstanding at the end of any given year
to a maximum of two thirds of the net revalued fixed assets, including
revalued work in progress. In calculating debt outstanding to determine this
ratio, account will be taken of actual debt drawdowns rather than the face
amount of the loan contracts. The level of revenues which would result from
the minimum tariff criteria outlined in paragraph 41, should be adequate
to provide a reasonable debt service coverage for the maximum amount of debt
that could be outstanding under this arrangement. If future tariff action
to be taken by Furnas  conforms only with the minimum tariff criteria, a
small part of the financing required from Eletrobras would have to be in
the form of share capital contributions.
56.       Furnas has agreed that it will not undertake any additional works
not related to the Furnas and Estreito projects or make any major addition
to its facilities costing over $1 million during the 1965-70 construction
period.
Future Earnings
57.       Forecast income statements for the period 1964-1970 are shown in
Annex 2. Sales in 1965 are expected to increase from 3.2 billion kwnh in
1964 to only 3.9 billion kwh due to an anticipated water shortage and because
the last two units of the Furnas plant will not be placed in commercial
operation until the first half of 1965. UJhen the Furnas plant is in full
operation, sales will increase to 4.5 billion kwh. The first unit of the
proposed Estreito project is expected to be placed in operation writh sales
again increasing slightly, late in 1968. The remaining units will be
commissioned in 1969 and ultimate sales will be 7.7 billion kwh per year.
58.       Future earnings using the minimum tariff criteria as stipulated
in paragraph 41 would be satisfactory. Beginning in 1965 net income before
taxes is computed with a 1' return on average net revalued plant in operation.
After taxes, the return would be 7.6% in 1965 reflecting, principally, the
effects of the revaluation tax in that year and would be maintained at 9%
thereafter. Net income after taxes would cover total interest, including
capitalized interest, about 1.5 times, except in 1967, rising to a maximum
of 1.8 times by 1970. Total debt service would be covered about 1.4 times
or more except in 1967 and 1968, when coverages would fall to 1.23 and 1.35
times.

Future Financial Position
59.       Forecast balance sheets as of Deceniber 31, 1964 through 1970 are
shown in Annex 4. They reflect debt/equity ratios deteriorating gradually
from 50/41 in 1964 to 68/32 in 1968, reflecting the considerable amount of
debt incurred in the period, and improving thereafter to 64/36 in 1970,
as a result of additions to surplus from earnings and anortization payments.
This forecast indicates that the local currency portion of the proposed
financing plan will have to be slightly revised in 1967 and 1968 to conform
with the proposed debt limitation as indicated in paragraph 55.
VII CONCLUSIONS
60.       The project consisting of the Estreito hydroelectric plant and
connections to the existing transmission grid is technically and economically
sound. Its estimated cost and the proposed construction schedule are
reasonable.
61.       The Borrower,- Furnas, a corporation owned principally by the Federal
Government, is now completing a similar lar 'ge hydroelectric plant and has
demonstrated its ability to supervise construction and place the plant in
operation. UIhenever necessary, it has engaged competent outside consulting
services on special problems and will do so in the future.
62.       Furnas is operating under regulations of the lWater Code as
administered by the t'ater Division, Ministry of Mines and Energy. These
regulations have been amended recently to permit revaluation of historical
cost investments for tariff making purposes. Furnas has completed revaluing
its balance sheets accounts through the year 1963, and intends, in mid 1965,
to revalue through 1964 after revised coefficients for that year are issued.
Furnas has applied for an increase in its tariff based on revaluation through
1963, and it is expected to be approved shortly. It will approximately
double the existing tariff and will be slightly in excess of the estimated
minimum tariff level for 1965 as agreed upon by the Borrower. Placing the
tariff increase in effect is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan. Furtherrnore, two loan covenants covering a rate of return of not less
than 10% of average revalued net fixed assets in operation and a debt
limitation of 66-2/3% of net revalued fixed assets including revalued work
in progress have been agreed upon which are expected to assure that Furnas
will maintain a sound financial position during the life of the loan.
63.       The first stage of the proposed Estreito project would be suitable
fox, a Bank loan of US$57 million, including interest during construction,
for a term of 25 years including about a six and one half year grace period.
