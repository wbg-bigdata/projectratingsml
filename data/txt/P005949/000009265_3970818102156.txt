ARGENTINA
GAS UTILIZATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                    Yacimentos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF)
Guarantor:                   Government of Argentina
Amount:                      US$180 miLlion equivalent
Terms:                       Repayable in 15 years, including three years of
grace at the standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:         The project comprises several components.  The
first is facilities for the recovery of liquids
from natural gas produced from the Aquarague,
Ramos and Acambuco fields in the north of the
country near the Bolivian border at Campo
Duran. These facilities will enhance the
recovery of propane, butane, natural gasoline and
(optionally) ethane, both from the existing flow
of gas from these fields and from the expanded
flow being made possible by increases to the
capacity of the Northern Pipeline System being
financed by the IDB. Second, provision is
included for the financing of other gas projects
of a debottlenecking character, as weLl as for
pilot projects for enhanced oil recovery. A
number of the debottlenecking projects have
already been identified on a preliminary basis,
and will be submitted for appraisal and
approval. Ten sites for pilot projects also have
been identified, work on which will be subject to
detailed feasibility review. A third component
comprises a crude supply pipeline and a products
pipeline at the Lujan de Cuyo refinery associated
with conversion facilities being financed under a
prior Bank loan. Fourth, financing is provided
for a pilot group of compressed natural gas (CNG)
refilling stations for vehicular use. In
addition, technical assistance is provided, both
to YPF and to the Government of Argentina for
energy planning purposes.
Project Benefits
and Risks:                   The Campo Duran facilities will extract
approximiately 165,000 tons per year of LPG and
74,000 m of natural gasoline, as well as prevent
flaring of 100 MMCFD of excess natural gas (by
reinjection). The liquid products may be
exported, and would generate an estimated US$70
million annually in foreign exchange. The export
market for ethane is uncertain, and a project
risk is that the market may not justify inclusion



-7-
of an ethane recovery unit, financing for which
is included in the project. The unit would cost
an estimated US$8.7 million, and if the market is
established, could generate sales of over US$20
million. Installation is modular, however, and
can be delayed until the market improves.
Returns on the other gas projects will depend on
the specific projects submitted, but benefits are
expected - given their debottlenecking nature -
to be high in relation to cost. The crude supply
and product delivery pipelines for Lujan de Cuyo
are also of a debottlenecking character with
correspondingly high prospective returns.
Benefits from the enhanced oil recovery pilot
work will derive from field-wide applictions and
while potentially significant, cannot be
estimated quantitatively at this point. Risks in
CNG should not be significant given the
provisions for thorough feasibility work, close
coordination with the private sector, adequate
pricing incentives, and the limited scope of the
pilot project.

Rate of Return:       -       ith respect to Campo Duran, valuing natural gas
at only depletion value, and assuming sale of
270,000 tons per year of ethane, the economic
rate of return (ERR) is estimated to be 30
percent. The ERR excluding the ethane unit is 22
percent. Preliminary review of the gas
debottlenecking projects indicates returns in
excess of 80 percent and of the pipelines
approximately 30 percent. The conversion of motor
vehicles from liquid fuels to CNC has a high
return, based on substitution of an abudant low-
cost resource, natural gas, for high-value liquid
petroleum fuels, and is estimated to have an ERR
of over 50 percent.

ARGENTINA
GAS UTILIZATWMN AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
i.       Natural gas is one of Argentina's primary energy resources, and since
the discovery and development of two significant new gas reservoirs (in the
north near the Bolivian border and in the west at Lomo de la Lata) at the end
of the last decade, the country's proved gas reserves have increased from
approximately 15 to 25 trillion cubic feet. The latter figure represents over
four billion barrels of crude oil equivalent, an amount of energy equal to
almost twice the country's total proved oil reserves. Energy consumption,
however, remains heavily weighted - by a factor of two-and-one-half times -
towards oil.
ii.      Although Argentina is self-sufficient in the production of oiL, most
of the country's oil fields are relatively old (petroleum was first discovered
in Argentina in 1908) and production from them is declining relatively
rapidly. Substantial new drilling is necessary to maintain oil production at
present levels and to avoid imports. Most oil fields in Argentina contain
significant volumes of associated gas. As a result the production of natural
gas will increase in the future as the production of oil is maintained.
iii.     Unless adequate investment is made in facilities to produce, recover,
transport and utilize natural gas, there is the prospect that significant
amounts of this valuable energy resource may be wasted. Already this has
become a substantial problem. Lack of adequate foreign exchange resources has
prevented sufficient investment in gas infrastructure from being undertaken
for several years. As of late 1984, of total production of approximately
1,865 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD), 130 MMCFD was flared because of lack
of gathering or compression facilities. This represents more than 22,500
barrels of crude oil equivalent per day, or approximately five percent of
Argentina's production and consumption of crude oil of approximately 480,000
barrels per day.
iv.      Investment in gas production infrastructure offers the opportunity to
restructure energy supply and demand and reduce the risk of Argentina's
becoming dependent on oil imports. The savings in foreign exchange
expenditures and foreign exchange earnings relative to the foreign exchange
component of investments in this area are particularly significant. Foreign
exchange savings would result from lessened energy requirements, and foreign
exchange earnings would result from fuel oil exported as a result of its use
domestically being displaced by natural gas, as well as from the export of
products separated from natural gas such as propane and butane.
v.       Beyond the important potential of natural gas in Argentina are other
areas in the oil and gas sector where new initiatives can be promoted.
Increased production of domestic crude oil must be met by increased
exploration for new fields, but significant contributions to production can
also be made by the application of enhanced oil recovery techniques in



- 10 -
existing fields. YPF, the Argentine state petroleum company and proposed
borrower, has already implemented an extensive program of "water-flooding" of
many reservoirs, a basic secondary recovery technique. Opportunities exist
for further production from the use of more advanced recovery techniques.
Additional petroleum may be recovered simply by identifying where in-fill
drilling would be productive. This information is best ascertained by
reservoir modeling and field testing on a pilot basis of production
techniques. It is important that selection of sites for enhanced oil recovery
techniques be made consistent with optimum development of Argentina's combined
gas and oil resources. Site selection and process evaluation requires
technical assistance from specialized international firms. Funds for this
work have been allocated, together with funds for other gas utilization and
transportation facilities which will remove bottlenecks in the hydrocarbon
sector.
vi       The abundance of natural gas in Argentina, the relatively high level
of the country's development, and the concentration of vehicle traffic in the
major metropolitan areas - notably, Greater Buenos Aires - also provide the
economic basis for use of compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicular
transport. Recognizing this, the Argentine authorities have drawn up a CNG
utilization program, which is also being supported under this loan. Imported
components for an initial group of CNG service stations would be financed.
Conversion of vehicles and maintenance would be undertaken by the private
sector.
vii.     As part of the Refinery Conversion Project financed by the Bank in
1981 (Loan 2032-AR), YPF agreed to construct a crude supply pipeline to the
Lujan de Cuyo refinery from neighboring fields (present supply arrangements
are by rail and truck) and to increase the capacity of a product pipeline from
Lujan de Cuyo to the Greater Buenos Aires area. Lack of foreign exchange has
prevented this work, which is important to successful completion of the
Refinery Conversion Project, presently scheduled to begin coming onstream in
1987. The additional capability to process heavier liquids financed under
2032-AR will facilitate disposal and utilization of fuels substituted for by
natural gas and is consistent with improvement in Argentina's integrated
production, processing, refining and consumption system.
viii.    YPF (Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales) is responsible for the
production of both oil and gas in Argentina. A separate state agency, Gas del
Estado, is responsible for gas distribution. YPF's operations have been
impaired by Argentina's lack of access to foreign credit; in addition, the
company's financial situation has been gravely affected by a combination of
low prices for its products net of fuel excise taxes collected by the
Government and high foreign borrowings incurred on behalf of the Government
during a period when the peso was devalued very rapidly.
ix.      In the late 70's, YPF had made progress in improving its operational
efficiency and finances. The difficulties encountered by Argentina during the
early 80's have, however, left the institution in a state of financial
disarray. It will require several years to restructure YPF financially and to
design and implement new financial control systems which will provide YPF and
the Government with adequate tools to evaluate the company's priorities in
detail and to assess results carefully. The proposed project includes
provision for technical assistance to both YPF and the Government to speed up



- 11 -
this process. The Government recently made a commitment to inject the
equivalent of approximately US$3.3 billion of fresh funds into YPF's equity
over a period of time. This measure, coupled with a commitment to assure YPF
adequate returns net of all taxes and royalties on net revalued fixed assets -
covenants with respect to which are included in the proposed loan - should
permit YPF to regain its financial viability and meet financial tests agreed
between YPF and the Bank under a previous Bank loan.
X.       Three Bank loans in the oil and gas sector in Argentina have been
made: US$27 million in 1980 to YPF primarily for seismic surveys and to
appraise oil reserves in existing reservoirs; US$100 million in 1981 to the
National Development Bank, BANADE, for onlending to private firms operating in
the energy sector; and US$200 million, also in 1981, to YPF to reconfigure two
major refineries. The first project is essentially complete. The BANADE loan
has been partially disbursed and is being amended to include financing of
working capital and service-related investments to facilitate future
disbursements. The Refinery Conversion project is essentially on schedule.
xi.      The proposed loan to YPF will build on the close working relationship
the Bank has established with the Argentine authorities in oil and gas sector
issues. The recently elected civilian Government in Argentina is in the
process of formulating new policies in the energy sector which in many ways
follow Bank recommendations. This affords the Bank an opportunity to continue
its dialogue with the Government at this critical juncture and to support
initiatives by the Government not only with respect to YPF, but also on key
policies, including pricing, improved use of natural gas resources, and
increasing participation of the private sector in this critical sectcr.

PART I - THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources and Supply
1.1      Argentina is endowed with substantial and diversified energy
resources. In 1982 its hydro power potential (over 25 years) was estimated at
1,430 million tons of oil equivalent (NMTOE); proven and potential gas
reserves at 2,080 MKTOE, and proven and potential oil reserves at 1,093 MMTOE.
Potential coal reserves are even larger, estimated at 4,575 MMTOE, but these
consist mainly of sub-bituminous coal with a high ash content remote from
consumers and which cannot be recovered at competitive cost. These resources,
together with estimated uranium reserves (but excluding relatively small
potential sources of energy such as biomass and firewood), are summarized in
Table 1.1 below. From the table it can be seen that the utilization of
Argentina's energy resources differs significantly from their share in the
country's total energy endowment:

1.2      Argentina's gas and oil reserves have recently been reviewed in the
context of an overall "Gas Optimization Study" carried out by the Argentinian
Energy Secretariat with the help of the Stone & Webster Engineering
Corporation (U.S.) and financed under IBRD Loan 1880-AR (1980). The estimates
for potential oil and gas reserves shown in Table 1.1 are based on a detailed
review of/geologic structures identified in the six producing basins of the
country_-
1/ Exploration for oil and gas has been conducted in the other twelve
non-producing basins, but no discoveries have been made, and no
reserve estimates for these basins are included. Basins are shown
in IBRD Map No. 18902 attached at the end of this SAR.

1.3      Argentina's energy resources are sufficient for the country to
sustain energy self-sufficiency. In 1983, national energy production was
equivalent to 99.3 percent of total national demand. The figure for 1976 was
84.7 percent. The country has become a net exporter of a modest amount of
petroleum products and imports mainly gas as well as coal and electricity.
1.4         1972, Argentina concluded a twenty-year gas import contract with
Bolivia.-  Since the date of this original contract, domestic gas supplies
have increased considerably beyond what was foreseen in the 1J01's.
Nevertheless the Government of Argentina has continued to honor its
commitments under this contract. The Government is now considering gas export
projects to Chile, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. In the coming decade some
175-200 MHCFD of gas could be exported, representing about 15 percent of
present domestic consumption.  Discussions with potential buyers of natural
gas exports have been underway for some time. The possibility of building LNG
and methanol plants for export has also been considered. Recent discussions
with the Brazilian and Chilean authorities indicate progress in the prospects
for integrating the use of gas on a regional basis. The Bank has encouraged
the concept of an integrated gas transmission system in the region and,
together with the IDB, is following these developments closely.
1.5      While coal has been observed and reported at about 250 surface
locations in fourteen provinces and Tierra del Fuego, only about three percent
of potential reserves have been proven, in the Austral Basin in Santa Cruz
Province in the south of the country. About 1.1 million tons of -raw coal are
produced in this area and transported by rail and ship over considerable
distance to Buenos Aires. Most coal is used for power generation in thermal
plants, particularly in San Nicholas to the northwest of Buenos Aires. Due to
the high cost of production and transport, exploration and production of
further coal reserves has been limited. The Bank is helping Argentina remedy
this situation through its support of a basic coal reserves inventory,
designed to establish investment priorities (Loan S-20).
Energy Demand
1.6      During the 1970's, final energy consumption increased by
approximately 2.5 percent per annum compared to an average GDP growth of 2.4
percent, in spite of slightly rising energy prices in real terms. This
suggests that scope for energy conservation is still possible in Argentina.
By way of comparison, in European countries, a one percent CDP growth is
typically associated with only a 0.8 percent increase in energy consumption.
In the 1961 Bank Refinery Conversion Loan, US$2 million was allocited to an
audit of energy-saving opportunities in the industrial sector.
1.7      The pattern of energy production and consumption changed
significantly late in the 1970's and particularly the early 1980's. As
increased natural gas reserves have been discovered and developed, natural gas
11 Approximately 2.4 billion cubic meters of gas were imported from Bolivia
in 1983, making gas one of Bolivia's principal exports. The project was
supported by financing from the World Bank (Loan 635-B0).

has replaced fuel oil both in industry and electricity generation. The share
of gas in final energy consumption increased from 15 percent in 1970 to
approximately 24 percent in 1983, while the share of fuel oil fell from almost
20 percent to less than 8 percent. Electricity increased from 8.5 to 12
percent, while other petroleum products decreased approximately 2 percent. In
electricity generation, gas, hydro and nuclear plants increased from 29 to
approximately 63 percent, whereas fuel oil and diesel decreased from 66 to 31
percent of total generation.
1.8      There remains additional opportunity for the substitution of higher-
value petroleum products by natural gas. In industry, gas could substitute
further for fuel oil, which still accounts for approximately 18 percent of
consumption. In the residential sector, naturaL gas could substitute for
liquid petroleum gas, kerosene and fuel oil, which together account for 32
percent of consumption in this sector.  Argentina also plans to use compressed
natural gas (CNG) for the replacement of gasoline and diesel, which account
for 98 percent of sectoral consumption ir the transport sector.  In the power
sector natural gas-fired power plants ccmpare favorably in economic terms with
all other types of power generation and could be increased from the present
35 percent share of electricity generation. While these substitution options
are economically justified, actual expansion of gas use is limited by the
existing gas transmission infrastructure. Present capacity is approximately
1,500 HNCFD. By the end of the decade, expansion of this system to
approximately 2,500 MMCFD is projected to be required. The Bank has begun
discussions with Gas del Estado about supporting this investment effort.
Oil and Gas Supply
1.9      Potential hydrocarbon-bearing areas in Argentina cover about
1.2 million km onshore and 600 000 million km2 offshore in eighteen
sedimentary basins. 900,000 kmf of additional potential hydrocarbon-bearing
areas are located in water deeper than 600 ft. Only six of the known
sedimentary areas are producing basins:
(a) The Northwestern basin (located in the provinces of Salta
and Jujuy);
(b)  Cuyo (in northern Mendoza and San Juan);
(c) Neuquen (in southern Mendoza, Neuquen, La Pampa and Rio
Negro),
(d) San Jorge (in Chubut and Santa Cruz);
(e) The Southern (or Austral) basin (in Santa Cruz and Tierra
del Fuego   an
(f) The Malvinas basin (mainly offshore Tierra del Fuego).
1.10     In the past fifteen years Argentina's oil reserves have remained
virtually constant. New exploration efforts - which have remained about
constant in recent years, as measured by the number of wells and total depth
drilled - have, on average, just compensated for consumption. Gas reserves,
however, increased dramatically in the mid 1970's, principally as a result of
the discovery of the Lomo de la Lata field in the Neuquen basin, which now
alone accounts for approximately 45 percent of all proven gas reserves in the
country. Thes2 trends are sunmmarized in Table 1.2 below.

1.11     New reserves have mainly been discovered in the Northwest, Austral
and Neuquen basins. Reserve balances have decreased in the San Jorge and
Cuyana basins. Almost all natural gas presently produced is associated with
oil. The new gas reserves consist of fields with significantly greater
proportions of gas than previous discoveries. As production shifts towards
these new fields, increasing amounts of gas will be produced together with
oil.
1.12     The average production of gas relative to oil country-wide (the gas-
oil ratio, or GOR) has increased from 120 (unit volume of gas per unit volume
of oil) in 1922 to 609 in 1983, or by approximately 2.7 percent per annum.
Between 1970 and 1983 the rate of increase in GOR was 4.7 percent per annum.
In the years between 1980 and 1983 the rate of increase accelerated to 9.1
percent per annum. This growth of GOR is expected to continue.
1.13     During 1983 approximately 105 BCF (3 billion m3) of gas were
flared. This was equivalent to an average of 290 MXCFD, 18 percent of total
gas production and 6 percent of total primary energy production this year. By
late 1984, 380 MMCFD were being flared. Of this volume, approximately _
35 percent or 130 MMCFD was flared because of lack of gathering or compression
facilities. The rest was flared because of operational reasons, such as high
carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide content, low producing rates, low pressure,
or the remoteness of the area.
1.14     The amount of gas flared in the future will depend not only on
substitution possibilities in the economy, potential export markets and
transmission infrastructure, but also on reservoir management techniques.
Costs imposed on the economy by flaring gas can be minimized by proper joint
management of oil and gas production from reservoirs. For example, production
of high-cost oil fields with a low gas-oil ratio may be preferable to
production of low-cost oil from fields which would produce large amounts of
gas. Examples of such instances include oil production from offshore fields
in the Austral basin which have a lower gas-oil ratio than onshore fields in
the same basin, or enhanced recovery from fields in the Cuyana basin, which
has a low gas-oil ratio. In general, fields with high GORs should be shut in
and exploration should be concentrated on areas where the expected gas-oil
ratios are low.
1.15     Secondary recovery accounted for 14 percent of Argentina's oil
production in 1982. This activity is concentrated in more mature basins with
low GORs. YPF has developed considerable experience with basic water-flooding
recovery techniques. More complex enhanced recovery techniques may also be



- 16 -
appropriate in fields with low gas-oil ratios where primary and basic
secondary recovery techniques have already been utilized.
1.16     Argentina's capacity to extract ethane and natural gas liquids
(propane, butane, and natural gasoline) from natural gas is insufficient to
accommodate the larger volumes of gas production foreseen. Ethane is used in
petrochemical applications. Liquid petroleum gases (LPG) - propane and butane
- may be exported; Argentina has been an exporter of LPG since 1982. In 1983,
Argentina sold about 24,000 tons of LPG at an average price of US$302 per ton
to neighboring countries and Japan. Natural gasoline from gas can be
processed and used similar to gasoline refined from crude.
Energy Development Strategy
1.17     Argentina's major objectives in the oil and gas sub-sector may be
summarized as follows:
(a) Implementation of an aggressive gas substitution program;
(b) Encouragement of exploration for new resources both by YPF
and private contractors;
Cc) Better adaptation of output of petroleum products from the
refinery systems to the pattern of domestic consumption;
(d) Adjustment in the domestic prices of oil and gas products
to assure economic utilization in relation to alternative
energy sources to encourage energy conservation; and
Ce) Supporting the financial viability of the public and
private enterprises operating in the energy sector.
1.18     The future direction of energy use in the Argentinian economy depends
importantly on the view the Government takes vis-a-vis potential oil and gas
reserves. Proven reserves for oil are equivalent to only 14 years of present
production. Proven gas reserves could last for over 40 years at today's
production rates (although gas is likely to be produced more quickly as it is
associated with oil). In the past the Government has promoted the use of
hydropower and nuclear fuel in electricity generation. It has encouraged use
of natural gas in industry, the residential sector and to a lesser degree in
power generation. This strategy has properly been oriented towards conserving
oil and making use of the country's more abundant gas resources. At the same
time it will prepare the country for the transition from a self-sufficient oil
producer to a net importer, assuming present petroleum resources begin to
deplete towards the end of the century.
1.19     Based on potential hydrocarbon reserves, however Cutilizing figures
from the Stone and Webster Gas Optimization Study), Argentina's oil reserves
would last 43 years at present production levels and gas 142 years. However,
as Argentina"s crude oil can be produced at a cost lower than the import price
of oil, and as gas is expected to be produced in association with oil at
increasing gas-oil ratios, large quantities of gas would have to be flared
unless gas can be utilized as a substitute for other energy sources in the
economy. The long-run marginal cost of gas would then reflect the fact that
excess associated gas is expected to be produced as a by-product of oil
production for at least 20 years. Based on these considerations, and allowing
for additional gas consumption in the power sector as well as significant
exports of gas to neighboring countries, the long-run marginal cost of gas is



- 17 -
estimated to be approximately US$1.10-1.40 per MCP.'/ At this economic cost
natural gas is competitive with all other energy sources in Argentina. In
particular, gas is competitive with hydropower and nuclear energy power
generation.
1.20     An energy strategy taking more explicitly into account potential oil
and gas reserves would promote vigorously the use of gas in the residential
sector, industry, power generation and transport (as compressed natural gas)
in order to minimize the use of petroleum products and make full use of gas
which would otherwise be flared. Continued substitution appears to be
justifiable in the power sector and in other sectors of the economy.
1.21     Calculations based on the energy balance of 1983 and using past
trends in energy substitution and a 3.2 percent growth of total energy demand
suggest that if a major gas substitution program were undertaken, Argentina's
oil reserves would last until the year 2017; gas   serves under such
assumptions would still last until the year 2025       In this scenario gas
would meet approximately 40 percent of final domestic energy demand and would
account for 70 percent of electricity generation. This would avoid flaring
and eliminate the need for significant investments in hydro and nuclear power
plants.
1.22     The Secretariat of Energy is presently studying these issues.  There
is a need to evaluate Argentina's energy policy alternatives more closely in
view of the country's recent rapid increase in gas reserves. The proposed
loan includes specific provisions for assistance in such a planning effort.
1.23     A program to add cracking facilities to Argentina's refineries to
increase the production of lighter products is presently being implemented.
The Bank is supporting this under Loan 2032-AR (July 7, 1981). Increasee
capability to process heavier portions of crude oil, which will result from
the Refiner-, Conversion project, will complement the displacement of fuel oil
which may be anticipated from increased use of natural gas supported under the
proposed project.
Institutional Framework
1.24     The Government's main energy policy-making and administrative body is
the Energy Secretariat within the Ministry of Public Works. The Energy
Secretariat is responsible for:
(a) Overall energy planning;
(b) Pricing policies;
(c) Approval of exploration and production contracts for
petroleum and gas (negotiated between YPF and foreign and
local private companies);

paragraphs, which are based upon present rates of consumption and do not
allow for growth in consumption). See Annex I for details.



- 18 -
td) Policies for energy conservation; and
(e) Development of new sources of energy.
1.25     The Energy Secretariat consists of four operational subsecretariats:
Electricity, Fuels, Planning, and Relations with Enterprises. The latter two
have only recently been created and are still in the process of being staffed
and organized. The Subsecretariat of Electricity has direct cqntrol over the
four largest of the nine major publicly owned power utilities- , and influence
on the decisions of the provincially owned power distribution utilities
through its control of an electricity fund. The Subsecretariat of Fuels is in
charge of supervising the three state-owned entitites responsible for oil, gas
and coal resources, respectively: Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Gas
del Estado WGdE), and Yacimientos Carboniferos Fiscales (YCF).
1.26     As a result of frequent changes in administration, energy policies -
particularly as regards energy prices - have been implemented in a
discontinuous manner in the past. The Bank has emphasized the need for a
comprehensive energy planning institution and consistent policies in this
sector. The new Planning Subsecretariat should help achieve this objective.
1.27     Government responsibility in the oil and gas sector is exercised by
two state-owned enterprises, YPF and Gas del Estado. YPF explores and
produces oil and gas and markets oil and petroleum products. Gas del Estado
transports and sells natural gas. Both firms use private sector enterprises
as contractors. Gas del Estado has concluded several operating contracts with
private firms. The largest contract, with a Dutch-led consortium, Cogasco, is
for operation and maintenance of the Central-Western Gas Pipeline, capable of
transporting approximately 350 MICFD.
The Role of the Private Sector
1.28     Exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas have been
undertaken by YPF since 1907. Since 1916, the private sector has also played
an active role in this area and a number of domestic private companies have
developed considerable experience. Approximately fifty of them, together with
several foreign oil companies, are presently active.
1.29     The extent of oil and gas production accounted for by private firms
reached relatively high levels (approximately one-third of total) in the early
70's and again after 1978; it has recently again declined somewhat. Recent
production of oil is summarized in Table 1.3 belowi.  Refining and marketing of
petroleum products has also been shared between YPF and private companies,
both Argentine and foreign. The private sector's share in refining amounts to
35 percent of total capacity. Among foreign firms, Exxon and Shell are active
in exploration, refining and marketing; Total, Deminex, Occidental, and Union
of Texas ir exploration; and Cities Service (Occidental) and Amoco in
production.
1.30     YPF acts as the Government's agent for all oil and gas exploration
and production in Argentina, except for a few old concessions granted to
1/ Agua y Energia Electrica, SEGBA, Hidronor and Yacyreta.

private companies before 1958.  YPF has a blanket concession on most of the
country, including offshore. For specific areas and periods, YPF subcontracts
exploration and production to other companies. YPF uses approximately 45
drilling crews of its own and subcontracts other work to private operators.
1.31     Thirty production contracts for production from known fields, and
fifteen "risk" contracts for the exploration of new areas, are currently in
effect between YPF and private companies. These contracts were awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding. They must be either Argentine
companies (incorporated in Argentina and majority-owned by Argentine
nationals), or consortia of companies with which an Argentine firm is
associated.
1.32     Eighteen of the thirty production contracts now in force and all risk
contracts have been awarded since 1976. Under all of these contracts,
contractors commit themselves to minimum investment and/or production
obligations. All oil produced is delivered to YPF, and payments to
contractors are made by YPF. Per-barrel (or per-MCF) fees are negotiated as
part of the bidding process.
1.33     Under production contracts, fees are denominated in pesos and
adjustable for inflation. Under exploration contracts fees are payable partly
in US dollars. They are initially set as a percentage of the international
price of crude, and are adjustable according to formulae which take into
account the peso:dollar exchange rate as well as domestic and international
inflation. While some significant finds have been-announced under exploration
contracts, notably by consortia headed by Total and by Shell, development of
these fields has not yet begun, and no production is currently being obtained
from areas under such contracts. All private production presently comes from
production contracts or to a small extent from concessions granted before
1958.
1.34     In recent years, the Argentine peso has been devalued at a
considerably faster rate than the rate of domestic inflation. As a result,
the US dollar-equivalent value of remuneration under the production contracts
deteriorated significantly. By mid-1983, the dollar-equivalent value of fees
payable by YPP to private contractors for ongoing production had fallen to
approximately US$5/bbl, or less than estimated direct lifting costs.
Confronted with declining revenues and uncertainty regarding future earnings,
new investment by private contractors stagnated and production declined. This



- 20 -
problem was less severe with respect to exploration contracts, which were
partly indexed to international price levels, but exploration also slowed.
1.35     New terms for most production contracts were negotiated during early
1983 and ratified in June 1983. Under the renegotiated terms, the reference
price of new production was raised on average to a level close to 60 percent
of the international price of crude; fees for basic production (defined on the
basis of standard field decline curves) were 50-60 percent lower than those
for new production. The mechanism by which peso-denominated fees were
adjusted for inflation was also standardized.
1.36     As part of these renegotiations a ceiling on crude prices was also
lifted and the distinction between basic and new production abolished. The
average pricq,per barrel of crude was lowered from US$14.60/Bbl to
US$13.25/Bbl-i and gas prices raised from US$O.50/MCF to US$0.60/MCF. The
negotiations were concluded in autumn 1984. The resulting prices for crude
production, net of all taxes and royalties, are comparable to costs and price
arrangements with private oil producers in other countries.
1.37     The Government has taken steps to encourage investment by Argentine
and foreign companies in oil and gas exploration offshore. In particular,
support for efforts by a consortium led by a foreign oil company to secure
project financing for a development project offshore Tierra del Fuego has been
discussed. Financing for the project will likely be possible only if YPF's
payment for future production, denominated partly in US dollars, were assured
by some form of supplementary guarantee.
1.38     The Government of Argentina's present policy with respect to the
private sector as expressed to the Bank is that private companies currently
operating according to production contracts with YPF will continue working and
that new acreage will be offered for bids. The Gcovernment has also stated
that it would review its legislation with a view to attracting further private
interest, particularly for exploration ventures. The Colombian association
contract system, where private companies bear all the risk of exploration and
share the cost and benefits of successful exploration with the state oil
company, is being considered as a model in this context. The Bank has
maintained ongoing discussions with the Government with the objective of
identifying appropriate measures to encourage greater private participation in
oil and gas exploration and development in the future.
Pricing
1.39     In Argentina, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products
are all Government-controlled, with the exception of lubricants, jet fuel,
asphalt, and certain semi-finished products. During certain periods, notably
1982, the Government allowed petroleum product retail prices to decrease
substantially in real terms (both including and excluding taxes), ostensibly
to control inflation. For most products, adjustments since have resulted in
1/ Excluding Amoco and Cities Service, for which lower prices have been
negotiated based on lower production costs. The overall average including
Amoco and Cities Service (Occidental) is approximately US$10/bbl.



- 21 -
present retail price leveLs comparable to end-1981. Diesel is one important
exception to this trend. Increases in the level of taxes hiad until recently
resulted in lower prices net of taxes on almost all products. During the 1982
South Atlantic crisis, the Government used excise taxes to mobilize resources,
a policy which was continued thereafter. In particular, taxes on premium and
regular gasoline were increased substantially. During recent months, the
Government has made a marked effort both to increase prices net of taxes to
YPF and to increase prices of middle distillates (e.g. diesel) and heavier
distillates (e.g. fuel oiL) at the retail level, improving the structure of
relative product prices. These developments are summarized in Table 1.4
below.

1.40     In recent years YPF has not been able to cover its costs based on
revenues to the company net of all taxes and royalty payments. It is
important that policy with respect to the pricing of petroleum products not
only assure economic use of these resources by proper pricing at the retail
level, both in absolute and relative terms, but also assure the financial
viability of YPF by appropriate levels of taxation (principally in terms of
fuel excise taxes).
1.41     Price incentives to consumers between the price of natural gas and
its substitutes should be consistent with their relative economic costs. This
will help promote the utilization of gas in the economy. Current price
relationship are summmarized in Table 1.5 (next page).  As shown in the table,
natural gas is presently priced well below the price of its substitutes. The
price differentials between natural gas and middle distillates as well as
between gas and LPG are sufficient to promote gas utilization in the
residential sector. The price differential between gas and fuel oil is also
sufficient to encourage substitution of gas for fuel oil in industry. Further
gas utilization in these sectors is primarily constrained by the lack of
transmission infrastructure.
1.42     In the case of fuel oil, prices at the retail level in relation to
economic cost as represented by the FOB-equivalent value were typicalLy of the



- 22 -
order of 75 percent, as indicated in Table 1.5, based on year-end 1984
values. Recent increases in fuel oil prices, coupled with decreases in world-
market prices, have brought this relationship to approximately 90 percent. In
conjunction with the proposed loan the Government has covenanted that fuel oil
prices would be brought up to 33 percent of the price of regular gasoline by
September 1986 and to 40 percent by end-1987. As of May 1985, fuel oil was 24
percent of regular gasoline prices.

1.43      Diesel is presently priced at somewhat above international price
equivalence. This avoids distortions in input costs in agriculture and
industry. In the transport sector diesel competes mainly with gasoline. The
price of diesel relative to gasoline has dropped from 75 percent (of the price
of regular gasoline) in 1981 to 34 percent as of end-1984; it is presently 45
percent. The share of gasoline in consumption in the transportation sector
has remained approximately constant. This has been due to restrictions on the
availability of diesel-powered cars for privete transport. In February 1985
the Government announced its intention to raise the price of diesel fuel,
together with the average prices of other middle and heavey distillates in
real terms by 2 percent per month over an 18-month period. Diesel prices have
increased from approximately US$0.70/gallon equivalent to US$0.82/gallon
from end-1984 to May 1985, and are presently approximately 45 percent of the
price of regular gasoline. Continued increases in accordance with this policy
would bring diesel prices to 55 percent of the present price of regular
gasoline by fall of 1986. In conjunction with the proposed loan the
Government has covenanted that diesel prices would be at least 53 percent of



- 23 -
the price of regular gasoline as of September 1986 and be brought up to 70
percent of the price of regular gasoline by end-1987.
1.44     The Government has announced its intention to set the price of CNG at
45 percent of the price of premium gasoline, (based on present prices,
approximately US$0.90 per gallon equivalent). This would assure the necessary
incentive to convert gasoline engines. When diesel engines are to be
converted, the price of diesel would have to be raised further, to
approximately US$1.20 per gallon to encourage substitution. Alternatively,
differential prices may have to be adopted for CNG dispensed to light and
heavy vehicles. Any loss of excise taxes from present excise taxes on
gasoline would be limited in the initial years of the conversion program due
to the low number of vehicles to be converted compared to the total fleet in
Argentina. Because the cost of CNG is less thar. the cost of gasoline, there
is scope for comparable revenue-raising from CNG as the market for CNG use
deveLops.
1.45     The pricing policies described above would establish differentials
between the price of natural gas and between petroleum products sufficient to
provide appropriate incentives for interfuel substitution based on increased
use of natural gas. The price of natural gas to the consumer (approximately
US$1.60 per MCF on average) is presently set at slightly above its estimated
economic cost. In conjunction with the proposed loan, the Government of
Argentina has agreed to exchange views with the Bank on energy pricing policy
on an annual basis.
1.46     Gas del Estado (GdE) purchases gas from YPF for approximately US$0.78
per MCF and for approximately US$4.50 per MCF from Bolivia. This results in
an average cost to GdE of approximately US$1.40 per MCF. GdE should pay a
price sufficient to cover YPF's costs of gas giLahering and treatment, which is
estimated to be approximately US$0.10 per MCF _ . The largest element in the
existing gas purchase price paid by Gas del Estado to YPF is royalties on gas
production; these amount to about two-thirds of the total purchase price. The
royalties are based on a hypothetical wellhead price for gas reaching the
equivalent of the international price of fuel oil by 1987. Royalties
constitute important income for the provincial governments in Argentina.
1.47     The Government has indicated its willingness to assume payment of the
difference between the price of Bolivian gas and gas produced by YPF. Based
on this commitment, GdE would pay an average of US$0.78 per MCF for gas
acquired either from YPP or Bolivia. The Government has also indicated a
willingness to assume substantial parts of GdE's dollar-denominated debt.
Nevertheless, based on US$0.75 per MCF acqusition costs and estimates of
actual transmission and distribution costs manned by Gas del Estado,
additional steps are necessary to assure Gas del Estado's financial
viability.
1/ This excludes YPF's costs incurred for LPG extraction. (LPG would
be extracted from the gas stream in any event, given its economic
value of over US$200 per ton).



- 24 -
1.48     Preliminary review suggests that Gas del Estado's total costs could
be approximately covered if the retail sale price of natural gas were
increased to the range of US$2.00-2.50 per MCF. At such a level gas would
still be competitive with fuel oil. This applies in particular to the price
of gas in the residential sector, where a relatively low consumer price
prevails at present. The Interamerican Development Bank is presently
discussing these issues with the Government of Argentina in the context of a
loan to GdE to increase the capacity of the Northern Gas Pipeline System. IDB
has requested covenants of Gas del Estado and the Government of Argentina
which should have the effect of resolving there gas price issues. The retail
price of natural gas would be an issue the Bank would review in detail in
conjunction with further operations in the gas sector in the future.
Role of the Bank
1.49     The Bank has approved three loans to the Government of Argentina in
the oil and gas sector. A first loan (1880-AR, June 24, 1980) for
US$27 million financed a seismic exploration program of approximately 1,000
line-km in the Northwestern basin, a survey of information available on
petrolerm and gas deposits, and the Optimization Study on the use of natural
gas referred to elsewhere in this report. The survey work focussed on
assessing proven secondary recovery oil reserves in about nine reservoirs in
various basins, proven reserves in newly discovered oil and gas reservoirs in
the Northwestern basin, and reservoir estimates in selected other basins.
This work has been completed satisfactorily, and the results have helped
provide the basis of YPF's current exploration strategy.
1.50     A second loan (2031-AR, July 7, 1981) for US$100 million, provided
long-term financing for exploration and production of petroleum and gas
resources by private sector firms through the National Development Bank,
BANADE. The loan included a component to develop BANADE's institutional
capacity to identify, appraise and supervise oil and gas subprojects. The
institution-building component of this loan has largely been achieved.
Approximately US$18 million has been committed and BANADE management indicates
that processing of several more subprojects representing approximately US$50
million is expected shortly. Disbursement of the BANADE credit has been
slower than originally foreseen because of uncertainties associated with
renegotiation of the exploration and production contracts, now largely
resolved, and the reluctance of domestic energy companies, the revenues of
which are peso-dominated, to assume the perceived exchange risk associated
with dollar borrowing. Amendments to the BANADE loan are presently being
prepared to provide for interim working capital financing and assumption of
the foreign exchange risk by the Central Bank. This should resuLt in more
rapid commitment of the balance of this loan.
1.51     A third loan (2032-AR, July 7, 1981), for US$200 million, financed
the installation of secondary processing facilities at YPF's two existing
refineries at La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo to increase the production of lighter
distillates. The project includes a plant operations improvement program, a
financial management improvement program, a training program for YPF personnel
and an industrial energy audit. Current estimates of the conversion component
are US$715 million compared to US$820 million at appraisal as a result of
generally lower-than-anticipated equipment costs. Foreign exchange cost
estimates have been reduced from US$410 million to US$240 million as a result



- 25 -
of the increased use of local supplies. The plant operations improvement
program has been progressing satisfactorily. The financial management program
is being restructured to reflect changes in YPF's financial situation and
management structure, and would be integrated with the technical assistance
included in the proposed loan.
1.52     The Bank's role to date in the oil and gas sector has been oriented
towards supporting efforts by the Government to ensure a more balanced
development of the country's hydrocarbon resources, both in terms of natural
gas relative to oil and in terms of public versus private sector investment.
This has been achieved by supporting efforts by the Government to improve
knowledge of Argentina's existing reserves, defining a better strategy for
utilization of resources through the Refinery Conversion Program and the Gas
Optimization Study, and by providing financing for private domestic energj
firms. These projects have proceeded satisfactorily, notwithstanding some
delays and financial difficulties, most of which have been associated with the
severe recession and economic uncertainties in Argentina.
1.53     The proposed project would serve as a basis for continuing the
ongoing energy policy dialogue with the present authorities, particularly
concerning energy sector planning; petroleum product pricing; gas utilization,
including export possibilities to neighboring countries; and encouragement of
the contribution of the private sector to oil and gas development.
1.54     The Bank strongly supports the integrated development of Argentina's
energy resources (oil, gas and hydropower), and has been assisting both the
Central Government and a number of pubLic enterprises in gathering and
interpreting the information required to design an appropriate mix of primary
energy which would reflect the relative importance of reserves and would take
into account the strong links that exist between oil and gas production. So
far the Bank has been concerned with resources assessment (Loan 1880-AR), _-
refineries configuration (Loan 2032-AR) and balance between public and private
sector investment. (Loan 2031-AR).
1.55     The proposed project addresses the issue of petroleum pricing
policies which is another important element of the Government strategy for
development of the sector, and establishes the basis for an in-depth review of
the sector investment program with the Energy Secretariat. This review will
be carried out as part of a forthcoming Public Sector Investment Review
mission and will be expanded as part of the technical assistance funded to the
Government under this loan.
1.56     The Bank's role in the gas sector is likely to extend, in the future,
to support for expansion of the domestic gas infrastructure and to gas export
possibilities from Argentina to neighboring countries. The Bank may be able
to assist in bringing to agreement the Governments of Argentina and those of
Chile and Brazil with respect to the realization of two separate and important
potential pipeline projects to export Argentine gas to these countries. These
projects could be of substantial mutual benefit to the importing countries,
and increase regional cooperation in the future. This could form the basis of
an interconnected gas supply network of the same nature as the systems which
have been built in Europe over the past twenty years.



- 26 -
1.57     The Bank has participated in important policy decisions in the oil
and gas sector over recent years. Revisions to existing contractual
arrangements between YPF and private companies for oil and gas exploration and
development were eventually reached partly as a result of discussions with the
Bank, which emphasized the importance of the contracts in the country's
petroleum sector development. The Bank also participated in discussions
leading to the Government's decision, in 1983, to support YPF by assuming
responsibility for much of YPF's outstanding foreign debt. This is the basis
of YPF's financial recovery plan and, together with appropriate price
policies, should enable the company to return to financial viability (see
further discussion under Part II, following, of this Staff Appraisal
Report). The Government has continued to request Bank assistance in
addressing operational and planning issues in the energy sector.
1.58     The proposed loan is designed to support efforts by YPF to improve
its overall management of the production of oil and gas. Selected subprojects
with high and quick returns which optimize reservoir management and the mix
between oil and gas supply will be supported.  Technical assistance components
would strengthen YPF's accounting, evaluation, and control systems. On the
basis of such systems, it should be possible to increase the efficiency with
which YPF is able to manage its operations. Review of the organi-ation and
cost-effectiveness of YPF's operations would be included under these
components.
PART II - THE BORROWER: YACIMIENTOS PETROLIFEROS FISCALES (YPF)
2.1      YPF is a state-owned petroleum company organized under the
Secretariat of Energy in the Ministry of Public Works. It is the largest
enterprise in Argentina and one of the largest oil companies in Latin
America. In 1983-84, YPF produced approximately 65 percent of Argentina's
output of crude oil and, working together with private-sector production firms
which produce oil under contract to YPF, oversaw production of most of the
remaining 35 percent. Tax revenues from YPF's sales provide approximately 15
percent of the Government's total revenues. YPF is the largest single
employer in the country; it has approximately 33,000 employees.
2.2      YPF's responsibilities are to produce sufficient crude oil and
natural gas to allow Argentina to avoid energy imports, and to refine, process
and market petroleum products to supply domestic demand. By these criteria,
the company has been largely successful. Imports have been limited and the
country has been essentially self-sufficient in production.
Organization and Management
2.3      YPF was established in 1922 as a Government department (a predecessor
organization had begun operations in 1907). In 1977, it was separated from
the Ministry of Public Works and converted to a state corporation. The main
objective of the change in status of YPF was to encourage it to function more
efficiently without being dependent on Government budget support.
2.4      The President and Vice President of the company are also Directors;
others of the Directors also hold operating positions in the company. The



- 27 -
Directors are appointed by the Government for a term of three years and are
eligible for reappointment without limitation. The company's formal
organization structure is attached as Annex III.
2.5      YPF operates through a headquarters in Buenos Aires and several
regional administrations. There are eight Departments of which two, Finance
and Industrial Relations, report to an Executive Committee headed by the Vice
President, and the remaining six (Research and Development, Production,
Transport, Industrialization, Sales, and Commercial Operations) report to the
General Manager of Operations, who is responsible directly to the President.
The General Manager of Operations is, in effect, the Chief Operating
Officer.
2.6      The number of employees at YPF declined from 51,700 in 1976 to 34,800
in 1980 and 32,800 by end-1983. The initial part of these reductions reflects
YPF's returning to private ownership a network of retail service stations.
The professional staff of YPF have a reputation for dedication and competence
known in the industry. On occasion, however, morale has been eroded by
insufficient adjustment of YPF's salary structure for inflation. During 1981
and 1982, salaries were periodically frozen, with the result that their real
value deteriorated significantly. Salary adjustments made during 1983 and
1984 have corrected some of these problems.-'
2.7      According to the Law of State Corporations, YPF cannot be declared
bankrupt and can onLy be dissolved by lav. The company's annual budget must
be approved by the cabinet, and its financial statements are audited annually
by the Sindicatura General de Empresas Publicas, the Government agency
responsible for public corporations.
Operations
2.8      YPF has been able to continue physical operations with relative
continuity, notwithstanding the great impact upon the company's financial
situation of events since 1980. Lack of foreign exchange has impaired YPF's
ability to import key parts and has required use of makeshift substitutes at
the expense of certain operating efficiencies. Similarly, lack of adequate
cash flow has forced the firm to cut all but essential expenditures. In
response to the latter problem portions of the fuel excise taxes collected on
behalf of the federal Government have on occasion been withheld by the
company.
2.9      Exploration and development of oil and gas in Argentina is undertaken
by YPF both on its own account and with the private sector on a contractual
basis. ApproximateLy 70 percent of exploration for oil and gas in Argentina
and 60 percent of development drilling is done by YPF. The balance is done by
private sector firms under contract to YPF. Details of these efforts are
shown in Annex Tables 7, 8 and 9, attached.
I/ Indication of the indexed value of YPF salaries is provided at the
bottom of Table 2.3, page 31.



- 28 -
2.10     The amount of new reserves added each year as a result of the
combined exploration effort of YPF and the private sector has approximately
equaled production, with the result that total reserves of crude have remained
relatively constant. However, the reserves-to-production ratio has declined
from levels over 17 years to recent levels under 14.
2.11     Annual production of natural gas by YPF has increased significantly,
from 285 billion cubic feet (BCF) in 1975 to 400 BCF in 1980 and 428 BCF in
1982. Natural gas is almost entirely associated with crude oil. Detailed
reserves and production statistics regarding natural gas are shown in Annex
Tables 5 and 17, respectively.
2.12     YPF operates over 4,600 kilometers of pipelines.  1,706 km are crude
oil lines and 2,951 km are petroleum product lines. The most important crude
lines are from fields in Neuquen to the west connecting petrochemical
installations located at Bahia Blanca south of Buenos Aires; the most
important petroleum product lines extend from Campo Duran in the north to the
port of San Lorenzo north of Buenos Aires. Details of pipeline operations are
shown in Annex Table 25.
2.13     YPF has a refining capacity of 460,000 barrels per day, or
approximately 65 percent of Argentine's total refining capacity. The balance
of refining is done by private companies, notably Esso and Shell. Details of
YPF's refining capacity and those of the private sector refineries in the
country are shown in Annex Tables 16 and 24.
2.14     In January 1980, YPF appointed Total, a French petroleum company, to
review the operations of its La Plata refinery, the country's largest (near
Buenos Aires), and to recommend measures for modernizing and increasing the
efficiency of operations there. Following submission of a report by Total in
September 1980, YPF developed, with Total's assistance, a Plant Operations
Improvement Program for the La Plata refinery as well as for YPF's second
largest facility at Lujan de Cuyo in Mendoza. Implementation of this program
is presently being financed with Bank funds under the Refineries Conversion
Loan. Under the Bank loan, funds were also provided for improvements in
financial management systems at YPF's refineries.
2.15     In general, the issues confronted by YPF are:
(a)  Inadequate revenues net of fuel excise taxes (or
"retention income"), other taxes and royalities;
(b) Loss of its equity base;
(c) Inadequate financial management and control systems;
(d) Need for improved evaluation and ordering of investment
priorities; and
(e)  Difficulty in planning beyond a short-term horizon.
2.16     [ost of these problems can be correlated directly with the financial
and economic problems of the country in recent years. Specific components of
the proposed loan focus on each of these areas. Price and taxation covenants
should assure YPF an adequate cash flow, and implementation of capital support
commitment by the Government (described in more detail below) should restore
YPF's equity base. Specific technical assistance would implement improved
financial controls and permit improved planning cap&bility. Review of YPF's



- 29 -
investment priorities would be undertaken as part of a technical assistance
component to YPF; this work would be coordinated with review of investment
planning in the sector to be undertaken by the Energy Secretariat, also
supported by the Bank. YPF's ongoing investment program and plans would be
reviewed periodically with the Bank as part of the proposed project.
Investment Program
2.17     The bulk of YPF's investm st program is allocated to exploration for
and production of crude petroleum.-   In 1983 these amounts represented US$710
million, or 87X of total investment of US$820 million. Physical exploration
and production activities by YPF (and prKvate contractors) during 1982 and
1983 are summarized in Table 2.1 below.PvDetails are shown in Annex
Tables 8 and 9.

2.18     The investment program in exploration and production originally
planned by YPF for 1984 and discussed with the World Bank was a relatively
ambitious one. YPF had planned to make up for lower rates of investment in
development drilling which it had undertaken in 1983 relative to 1982. While
development drilling by the private sector increased for 1983, uncertainties
concerning renegotiation of the contracts between the private producers and
the Government during 1984 indicated at that time that investment in this area
by private contractors might decline significantly.
2.19     YPF's total investment program for 1984 is estimated at US$900
million. While greater than the amount invested during 1983, this amount is
less than the amount planned by YPF one year ago, reflecting the satisfactory
resolution of the contracts issue with private sector firms. There is the
prospect, now that the operating contracts for private sector firms have been
successfully renegotiated, that investment by the private sector will

common industry practice, funds spent on successful weLls are capitalized

increase. However, the ability of many Argentine energy companies to invest
has been affected by the country's severe economic recession.
2.20     For YPF like any oil company there is flexibility in the amounts
which may be spent in exploration and production in any given year. It may be
considered that in an environment of severely limited resources, such
expenditures might presently be curtailed. In the case of Argentina, however,
a continuous flow of new investment in exploration and development drilling is
necessary to prevent rapid declines in the level of crude production.
Argentina's oil reservoirs are numerous (over 360 are currentLy in
production), but they are generally of small size and short-lived. The
average well produces approximately 60 barrels per day and lasts only ten
years. Out of approximateLy 7,000 producing oiL wells, 600-700 cease
production every year and must be replaced just to maintain production.
Operating Results
2.21     YPF's financial situation has been very seriously affected by the
very large rates of Argentine inflation and the large differentials between
rates of domestic inflation and the rate of change of the value of the
Argentine peso relative to the US dollar. The impact of these effects on YPF
can be separated into monetary gains (or losses) and exchange gains (or
losses). Monetary effects have resulted primarily from differences in amounts
of assets and liabilities denominated in pesos. As YPF's peso liabilities
have generally exceeded its peso assets, these effects have generally been
positive. Exchange effects have resulted from much of YPF's debt being
contracted in dollars, whereas the company's assets (and earnings) are in
pesos. These effects have been particularly large and usually negative.
2.22     Adjustments to YPF's capital account necessary to reconcile
revaluations of assets and the differential impact of monetary and inflation
adjustments upon asset and liability accounts have been carefully accounted
for by YPF. The magnitude of these items, however-particularly during the
1981-83 period-has been very large, to the point of rendering difficult
meaningful financial analysis of operations. The adjustments in YPF's income
accounts are made on a year-end basis and not aLlocated on a line-by-line
basis. As a result, comparative interpretation of historical income
statements on an item-by-item basis is very difficult.
2.23     Summary historical income statements, following YPF's own accounting
format, are shown in Table 2.2, following page.
2.24     YPF's cost of goods sold and operating costs have, according to its
statements, regularly exceeded revenues net of fuel excise taxes.
Nevertheless, because of monetary and inflation adjustments, it is difficult
to draw firm conclusions with respect to the profitability of YPF
operations. During periods when the peso devalued more rapidly than it
inflated (notably 1981-82), YPF was negatively affected by these adjustments;
during periods of parallel rates of devaluation (1983) or strengthening of the
peso relative to the dollar (such as prevailed during 1979-80), the net



- 31 -
monetary and inflation adjustment was positive.!' The principal benefit from
inflation realized in the past has been gains from declines in the real value
of YPF's liabilities. The principal cost of devaluations has been increases
in the relative value of YPF's dollar-denominated debt.
2.25      Summary historical balance sheet data for YPF are presented in
Table 2.3. Data are presented in constant December 1984 dollars, based on
constant peso adjusted figures prepared by YPF and converted to US dollars
according to the official rate. Individual balance sheet items are revalued
or adjusted as of year-end; overall balancing adjustments are consolidated in
the net worth account.

2.26      YPF's (adjusted) net worth deteriorated significantly, from levels of
US$2.4 billion equivalent as of end-1980 to negative US$1.2 billion equivalent
as of end-1982. While this situation was severe, it also characterized all
enterprises in Argentina which borrowed dollars, held peso assets, and the
earnings of which were primarily in local currency during this period. During
1981-1982, the rate of exchange of the Argentine peso relative to the US

the US dollar are shown in the memo items to Table 2.3, following.

dollar deteriorated more rapidly than domestic rates of inflation by a factor
each year of approximately two to one.
2.27       The dollar debt which YPF had outstanding as of year-end 1980-
approximately US$1.5 billion-doubled in constant peso terms during 1981 and
again during 1982. Further, YPF borrowed significant additional amounts of
dollars during the 1981-82 period. After disbursement of the dollar amounts
borrowed by YPF was made to the Central Bank of Argentina (and peso equivalent
amounts advanced to YPF), however, foreign exchange was not subsequently made
available to YPF to the extent of the resources borrowed. Much of the
increase of YPF's foreign debt during this period can be considered to have
been incurred on behalf of the Government of Argentina for balance-of-payments
purposes.

2.28     In order to re-establish YPF's financial integrity, it will be
necessary not only to increase prices net to YPF after fuel excise taxes and
other taxes to restore YPF's earning power, but also to recapitalize the
company. Important adjustments in petroleum product prices have already taken
place at the retail level, although prices to YPF net of taxes remain low.
Commitments with respect to future price adjustments and net revenues to YPF
will be requei ed of the Government of Argentina in connection with the
proposed loanz'. Recapitalization is being accomplished by means of a
commitment by the Government of Argentina to pay much of YPF's debt contracted
in foreign currencies, as discussed below. These steps will simultaneously
increase YPF's net worth and decrease the debt service burden on YPF's cash
flow.
Commitment by the Government of Argentina
2.29     Legislation passed in November 1983 provides for payment by the
Government of Argentina of both principal and interest on much of YPF's
foreign debt. The amount of the Government support was $a57,821,138,000 as of
November 1983. This was approximately US$3.3 billion equivalent based on
official November 1983 rates of exchange, or approximately two-third of YPF's
foreign currency liabilities. The 1983 legislation provides in general terms
that the amount of the commitment is to be adjusted with inflation, to accrue
interest at a rate equivalent to the (real) cost of YPF's dollar borrowings,
and to be disbursed as YPF's debt service obligations fall due until fully
utilized.
2.30     Disbursement of the Government commitment depends upon the debt
service schedule determined for YPF as part of the rescheduling of Argentina's
public sector debt, of which the YPF debt is a part. Specific procedures for
implementation of the commitment, including the specific mechanisms for
adjustment and disbursement, have been prepared by the Ministry of Public
Works and are to be issued shortly as a Presidential decree.  Issuance of this
decree with content satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed loan.
Projections
2.31     The unusual circumstances under which YPF has operated during recent
years and the unsatisfactory financial situation of the company at present
make it very difficult to project financial results for the company with
confidence. The Bank, YPF and the Government of Argentina have maintained an
ongoing dialogue with respect to the financial situation of the company. The
Bank was involved in discussions leading to the commitment by the Government
described above. The Bank has also discussed on a continuing basis with the
Government of Argentina not only pricing policies which are necessary to
assure the economic allocation of energy resources, but also taxation policies
which, together with appropriate pricing, would assure the financial viability
of YPF.
2.32     As a basis for these discussions, a detailed financial model of YPF
has been prepared by Bank staff. The model has been revised and reviewed
1/ See also discussion under "Pricing," Part I of this Staff Appraisal
Report.



- 34 -
frequently with YPF and Government authorities. Repeated use of the model has
provided useful insight into YPF's financial situation. A more complete
discussion of assumptions employed in the model and financial results
projected is attached as Annex X. In the "base case" scenario used in the
model prices of lighter distillates are assumed maintained in constant dollar
terms and middle and heavy distillates increased two percent per month in rela
terms over an eighteen-month period, in conformance with policies announced by
the Government. Fuel excise taxes are assumed to decline from present levels
to twenty percent of gross retail sales by 1989.
2.33     The model shows that, based on the covenants associated with the
proposed loan, YPF's financial situation would improve significantly and
within the project period (1988), profitability would be achieved. The model
does not incLude any assumptions regarding chsnges in the cost structure of
YPF's operations or changes in the rate at which petroleum is discovered and
produced based on YPF's own projections. Technical assistance components of
the proposed loan are directed to improving both the efficiency of operations
and the evaluation of investment priorities and may improve the results
projected.
2.34     YPF is currently reviewing its 1985 investment program with the
Government. This process is made difficult by the slow and cumbersome
financial and information systems within YPF. It is important that improved
information systems be established which would permit YPF and the Government
to evaluate expeditiously the relative feasibility of various projects, and to
assign priorities among them within the general objective of optimizing
development of the country's oil and gas resources, particularly in respect to
the participation of the private sector. To assist YPF in achieving these
objectives, the proposed project includes specific provisions for improved
information systems and planning capabilities. The systems support is
designed both to improve the information available to management and to
recommend opportunities for more efficient decision-making. The objective of
the planning support will be to create a mutli-year planning capacity based on
improved resource data and optimization criteria. This effort would be
coordinated with the planning effort at the Government level also supported
under this project.
Proposed Investment Program
2.35     YPF has proposed a tentative investment program for the 1985-89
period which includes provision for maintaining efforts in exploration for and
production of petroleum essentially at current levels and provides for
completion of the refineries reconfiguration program being undertaken with
World Bank financing.  The investment program proposed by YPF is suunmarized
below by functional area according to YPF's categories.
2.36     YPF has not been able to develop consistent long-range investment
planning.  The investment program shown above reflects a short-term strategy
aimed at maintaining production at current levels. The exploration efforts
have been concentrated in low-risk areas. This limited objective has been
necessitated by current financial constraints. However, it does not provide a
basis for long-term development of Argentina's oil and gas resources. More
detailed review of the priority of investments in the context of optimized
production of both oil and gas is needed.

2.37     Review of both YPF's investment program and total investment in the
oil and gas sector has been included in technical assistance components under
the proposed loan. YPF's investment program would be reviewed with the
Covernment and the Bank on a periodic basis, including estimates of investment
by the private sector. These steps should contribute to a more efficient
investment program by the company and to improved coordination of investment
between YPF and the private sector.
2.38     Total investment (local and foreign) in the proposed project
components averages approximately US$100 million annually over the project
period, or 15-18 percent of investment in production facilities projected by
YPF. Total project investment in relation to YPF's total proposed investment
program is of the order of 8-10 percent.
Financial Covenants
2.39     In conjunction with the Refinery Conversion Loan, YPF covenanted with
the World Bank, among other conditions, that:
(a)  "The Borrower shall (i) maintain a quick ratio of 0.6:1,
and (ii) not ... make any ... cash distribution, if after
such [distribution] ... such ratio would be smaller than
0.8:1 [Section 5.05(a)];
(b)  "The Borrower shall, at all times, maintai' a debt:equity
ratio not greater than 60:40" [Section 5.05(b)]; and
(c)  "The Borrower shall not incur any debt ... unless ... the
projected net revenues of the Borrower ... shall be at
least 1.4 times the projected debt service ... [Section
5.05(c)].
2.40     The ratios which result from the assumptions incorporated in the
financial model (Annex X) are summarized in Table 2.5 below.

Note: Refinancing of YPF foreign debt obligations Is assumed during 1985 on the same terms as have
been announced for long-term public sector debt held by comuercial banks.
2.41     At the time of the Refinery Conversion Loan (1981), the effects of
the South Atlantic crisis of 1982 and the extraordinary rates of inflation and
devaluation which followed could not, of course, be anticipated. The Refinery
Conversion Project Loan Agreement does not define how the Government support
commitment, legislation for which was passed in 1983, should be interpreted in
terms of YPF's financial covenants to the Bank. The Bank has agreed to
include undisbursed balances of this commitment in the calculation of the
ratios for certain purposes, as discussed below. (Results from the financial
model both including and excluding the commitment are shown above).
2.42     The covenant regarding YPF's quick ratio is designed to assure
adequate liquidity and to prevent cash distributions unless the company is
sufficiently liquid. Under current circumstances (in which YPF is very
illiquid), such distributions should not be permitted (nor have any been
made). An important determinant of YPF's future quick ratios will be the
rescheduling of YPF's short-term debt (including payments in arrears) to a
long-term basis. The Bank has agreed to include disbursement of funds from
the Government capital support commitment during the next year in the
evaluation of this ratio. No distribution would be permitted until a quick
ratio of 0.8 is achieved, as provided by existing covenants under the Refinery
Conversion loan.
2.43     With respect to YPF's debt:equity calculation, inclusion of the
undisbursed balance of the Government's capital support commitment as equity
makes an important difference; this reflects the recapitalization intent of
the commitment. The Bank has agreed to the inclusion of undisbursed balances
of the Government capital support commitment as equity for the purpose of
evaluating this ratio. The Bank's projections suggest, however, that even
including the Government commitment as equity, YPF's debt:equity ratio will
still exceed the 60:40 level until 1989. The Bank has accordingly agreed that
this ratio be achieved at least in accordance with the following timetable:
through end-1987, 68:32; by end-1988, 66:34; and by end-1989, 60:40.
2.44     The Government commitment, by meeting much of YPF's debt-service
obligations, has the effect of minimizing debt service as a financial



- 37 -
constraint. YPF should meet the minimum 1.4 ratio covenanted if payments by
the Government to meet YPF's debt-service obligations in a given year are
included in the calculation of this ratio. The Bank has agreed to inclusion
of the capital support commitment on this basis.
2.45     In current operating terms the most important determinant of YPF's
financial viability is its revenues net of fuel excise and other taxes
(including royalty payments).  In this respect commitments by the Government
to increase middle and heavy distillates prices relative to gasoline should --
together with maintenance of gasoline at current price levels and no increases
in taxation - provide YPF financial self-sufficiency. The Government has
agreed to assure that petroleum product prices net to YPF of all taxes and
royalties will be adequate to provide YPF, operating efficiently, with funds
sufficient to cover YPF's costs and expenses, including interest; to allow YPF
to meet the financial covenants above-described; and to achieve at least a six
percent return on YPF's revalued net fixed assets.
Auditing and Reporting Requirements
2.46     YPF will be required to submit to the Bank annual financial reports
audited by the Sindicatura General de Empresas Publicas within six months of
the end of each fiscal year. The audit reports will contain comments by the
auditors whether the covenants in the Loan Agreement are being met.
2.47     YPF also would be required to submit to the Bank:
(a)  Quarterly financial projections and projected investment
program within one month of the beginning of each quarter;
and
(b) Twelve-month and three-year financial projections
including investment program within four months of each
fiscal year.
2.48     The projections prepared above would initially be based on YPF's
existing reporting system but would include the results of the work of the
systems consultants as this becomes available. These reports would be
reviewed annually by the Bank jointly with the Government of Argentina on a
periodic basis. The preparation of projections and their use for planning
purposes by YPF management and the Government is an important objective of the
technical assistance program proposed under the present loan.
2.49     Within four months after the Closing Date of the project, YPF would
be required to prepare and furnish to the Bank a Completion Report.

PART III - THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.1      Although natural gas reserves, following discoveries in the late
1970s, have increased to the equivalent of 45 years of production (at 1983
levels), their development poses a number of technical and economic issues.
In particular, oil and gas production must be jointly optimized. Many fields
have high gas-oil ratios. In several areas oil production has had to be
limited to avoid the flaring of large volumes of gas for which there is no
outlet into the pipeline network; in other industrialized areas, gas demand
remains partly unmet. Lack of infrastructure is the principal constraint to
YPF's and Gas del Estado's flexibility to move gas supplies. Expansion of the
capacity of the Northern Gas Pipeline has been identified as the most cost-
effective way to utilize Argentina's rapidly increased gas reserves to main
consumers in the Buenos Aires area.
3.2      A number of other gas debottlenecking projects of smaller size
require further preparation before they can be financed. Nevertheless,
because of the debottlenecking character of these projects, they are of high
priority and offer large economic returns. Opportunities also exist for
substantial recovery of additional petroleum resources from Argentina's
existing mature fields by enhanced oil recovery techniques, and for the
substitution of liquid hydrocarbon consumption in vehicle transportation by
the use of compressed natural gas (CGG).
3.3      The objective of the proposed project is to move forward in each of
these areas.  The production of gas and associated liquids would be increased
through gas field development and expansion of the transmission system in the
north; a number of gas and pipeline debottlenecking projects in the country
identified on a preliminary basis would also be financed; use of gas would be
expanded by the introduction of CNG in transportation; and oil production
would be improved by use of enhanced oil recovery methods and more effective
reservoir management by YPF. In addition, technical assistance components of
the project would strengthen YPF's organization, financial administration and
investment planning capabilities, together with assistance in specific
operations areas, and support the Government's energy planning effort.
Project Description
3.4      The project includes facilities associated with the expansion of the
Northern Production and Transmission System, other gas and liquids
debottlenecking subprojects and enhanced oil recovery pilot projects,
compressed natural gas utilization, and technical assistance to YPF and the
Government of Argentina.  A summary of project components including financing
proposed for the Bank is shown in Table 3.1 following.

Expansion of the Northern Gas Production and Transmission System
3.5      Gas demand has been growing steadily in the Buenos Aires area and in
the other industrialized zones of Argentina, particularly along the corridor
extending north of Buenos Aires to Rosario, Santa Fe, Cordoba and Tucuman.
However, YPF and Gas del Estado have been unable, primarily for financial
reasons, to undertake the investments required to expand the production
facilities and the transmission systems, which currently operate at
capacity.  As a result, potential gas demand remains unmet, and some present
industrial users and power utilities are obliged to revert to liquid fuels in
the winter when total demand on the system peaks.  No further growth of gas
demand can be accommodated by existing facilities.  Growth in potential demand
is estimated to be grdwing at 18 percent annually.
3.6      The Northern Cas Line expansion component of the proposed project
aims at expanding gas delivery capacity to Buenos Aires and to other high
demand areas. The component includes (a) field development in the Aguarague,
Ramos and Acambuco fields; (b) increase in the capacity of the Northern
Pipeline System; and (c) expansion of a liquid recovery system at Campo Duran.
(a)  Field Development - This includes the drilling of 16 wells
in the Aguarague field within the next 15 years for
additional production. Development of the Aguarague
field, including associated flow lines and surface
facilities, requires relatively little direct foreign
exchange: tesources, and will be undertaken by YPF on its
.



- 40 -
own account. Similarly, the Ramos and Acambuco fields are
expected to be developed by the respective private sector
contractors who operate these fields.
(b) Capacity Increase of the Northern Pipeline System - The
expansion of the Northern Pipeline is being undertaken by
Gas del Estado, with Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
financing. While four major pipeline systems converge on
the Buenos Aires area, all of which require expansion, the
Northern Pipeline is of the highest priority because of
the concentration of existing and projected gas demand in
the cities along this route, which follows the northern
industrialized corridor. The pipeline was built in 1971
to transport gas imported from Bolivia (225 MMCFD) under a
take-or-pay contract which expires in 1992, and from other
fields in northern Argentina. The capacity of the
Northern Pipeline can be expanded in a cost-effective
manner from 335 MMCFD to 475 MMCFD by adding compression
stations. The pipeline currently accommodates only a
fraction of the potential gas production of the fields
located near the head of the line in Argentina, discovered
in the late 1970s.
(c) Expansion of the Campo Duran Liquid Recovery Plant - It is
proposed that the liquid recovery system capacity at Campo
Duran be expanded from 250 to 575 MMCFD by installing a
new turbo expander unit and revamping the existing one.
This would permit the most efficient recovery of liquids
from increased gas production. Reinjection compressors at
the Campo Duran field are also included to rTinject excess
gas in the summer, together with facilities to collect and
transport gas and liquids. The Campo Duran facilities
would be financed by the Bank. More detailed description
of this component, including criteria for selection of the
turboexpander process for recovery of gas li-uids, is
given in Annex V attached.
3.7      The major parameters for expansion of the Northern Gas Production and
Transmission System have been reviewed and found to be suitable to support the
additional supply of gas. These include:
(a) Reserves and Production: The proven gas reserves (more
than 3.3 TCF) and production history of oil and gas fields
in the Campo Duran area (Salta province), where the
Northern Pipeline originates, will assure, together with
gas imporis from Bolivia, adequate continuous supply of
the current (335 MMCFD) and the additional (140 MMCFD)
volume of gas required for the expansion for at least
twenty years. Production volumes from the Argentine
fields are also adequate for supply purposes assuming
imports of gas from Bolivia are terminated once the



- 41 -
contract between Ar-gentina and i.--ilivia expires in 1992.
The producing fields (Aguarague, Raos, Campo Duran and
Acambuco) and associated reserves and production data are
described in detail in Annex II. Reserves estimates are
based on reservoir studies carried out by YPF, their
consultants (Inlab S.A.) and private operators. They also
have been reviewed by Bank-financed consultants. They are
considered reasonable and agree with the basic assumptions
used by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in their
evaluation of the pipeline component of the expansion of
the Northern Transmission System. The gas produced by
these fields is relatively rich in liquids which can be
recovered and sold in Argentina or exported.
(b)  Existing Infrastructure:  A multi-product 16" pipeline
connecting Campo Duran to the San Lorenzo refinery, near
Rosario north of Buenos Aires, has sufficient spare
capacity to transport the additional volume of natural gas
liquids foreseen either for the Buenos Aires market or for
export. The nearly depleted Campo Duran field can be used
as underground storage for excess gas being produced
during off-peak periods. Distillation facilities, a
dehydration unit, utility services, and product storage
tanks presently at Campo Duran have adequate capacity for
the additional volumes to be handled.
3.8      The availability of gas in 1992 has been evaluated both under the
assumption that the Bolivia export contract is extended for another 10 to 20
years, and assuming that the the Bolivia export contract is not extended and
gas is provided only from the local Argentine fields. SuppLy is adequate
under either scenario.  The supply of gas is summarized in Annex V (Table
V.1), attached.
.9       Liquid products from the existing and the new faciLities are
summarized in Table 3.2 following:

3.10     In addition to these liquids, which are extracted from the natural
gas stream at the turbo expander facilities, the increase in production of
natural gas will result in the produciton of additional volume of condensate
oil (API 50-55w) of the order of some 4,500 BPD. This condensate is
transported directly from field separators to the Campo Duran topping plant
(for further processing) through an oil pipeline which is also to be financed
under the proposed loan.
Debottlenecking Subprojects and Enhanced Oil Recovery Pilot Projects
3.11     A number of gas projects need to be undertaken to remove bottlenecks
which presently prevent YPF from moving towards more optimum joint production
of oil and gas from existing fields. Although no projects have yet been fully
appraised, a number of project proposals at various stages of preparation have
been reviewed with YPF and their consultants. Some of these were identified
in the Gas Optimization Study carried out by Stone and Webster. A component
of the project would be allocated to finance these relatively low-cost
projects (US$5-10 million equivalent) which, because of their debottlenecking
character, can generate significant economic benefits.
3.12     Individual projects would be submitted to the Bank on a case-by-case
basis for approval. A tentative list of such projects is provided in Annex
VI. Examples include:
(a) Compression facilities for the reinjection of gas during
off-peak seasons to avoid flaring;
(b) Liquids separation units to recover marketable liquids
from natural gas (otherwise burned); and
Cc) Gathering lines and small field compressors to collect gas
presently being flared.
Criteria for project evaluation will include contribution towards optimization
of oil and gas production system-wide.
3.13     Funds allocated under this component would also be used to finance a
group of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilot pro. cts to be undertaken by YPF.
Technical assistance, training and studies for more effective reservoir
management in ongoing oil production operations would be included in this
component.  YPF, with the help of consultants financed by the Bank, has
identified ten fields as suitable for use of EOR methods (see Annex VI).
Initial work would be focused on five of these candidate fields. Financing
would be provided to evaluate fields in stages. First, feasibilit-y studies
would be undertaken on all the candidate fields. If prospective results are
justified by the feasibility studies, which would be submitted to the Bank,
specialized studies of core samples and resevoir characteristics would be
undertaken, and simulation studies done. Finally, pilot projects would be
constructed, including drilling, workover, and completion. The results of the
pilots would be carefully evaluated.
3.14     Expert consultants would be contracted for this work, and YPF staff
would be trained on an on-the-job basis at each of the steps. The EOR project
component should enable YPF together with the consultants, to identify the



- 43 -
highest priority fields with enhanced oil recovery potential, to define an
implementation program to economically recover additional oil from the
selected fields, and to evaluate institutional and contractual arrangements
for future EOR work.
3.15     YPF has had to postpone many gas debottlenecking and enhanced oil
recovery projects primarily for lack of foreign exchange resources. Although
the costs of these projects are small, the impact in terms of increased oil
production and recovery of gas liquids can be significant. For example, in
the Loma de la Lata field, approximately 1,100 BPD of oil production is
foregone because of lack of compressors to reinject associated gas.
Similarly, numerous enhanced recovery projects have not been undertaken where
incremental oil production is projected to be less costly than alternative
sources.
3.16     The proposed loan will provide for US$46 million (including
contingencies) to finance the foreign exchange cost, not to exceed US$10
million per project, of production debottlenecking and enhanced oil recovery
subprojects subject to prior approval by the Bank. Eligible subprojects
should meet a high priority test in the context of optimization of overall oil
and gas production on a country-wide basis. Debottlenecking subprojects
should yield economic rates of return of no less than 15 percent. The
eligibility of pilot projects for enhanced oil recovery will be based on
potential benefits, taking into account the probability of results as well as
cost.
3.17     YPF's annual work plan with respect to these projects will be
reviewed and agreed with the Bank and with the Energy Secretariat in the
framework of an annual joint review of YPF's overall investment program. The
criteria for selection and the procedure for appraisal of individual
subprojects will be agreed with the borrower. The Bank's approval of
subprojects will permit the Bank to monitor YPF's effectiveness in optimizing
its production system.
Lujan de Cuyo Pipelines
3.18     Under the 1981 Refineries Conversion Project, YPF undertook to build
a new crude pipeline to assure the efficient supply of crude oil to the Lujan
de Cuyo refinery, and to upgrade the system of white product pipelines to
transport the increased production of light and middle distillates resulting
from the conversion project. These pipelines need to be completed by 1987,
when the new upgrading facilities of the refineries are expected to come on
stream. Investments in the pipelines, however, have been delayed because of
lack of foreign exchange to import special parts and equipment. The project
component would address this problem.
3.19     The Lujan de Cuyo refinery is in Mendoza Province, in the west of
Argentina. It is the second largest refinery in Argentina, with approximately
130,000 barrels/day (BPD) of primary distillation capacity. Approximately
80,000 BPD of crude oil are supplied to Lujan de Cuyo from neighboring fields
in northern Mendoza and about 30,000 BPD are supplied from Malargue, about 160
km to the south. Crude oiL from Malargue is presently supplied by rail and



truck, at relatively high cost. Production of the Mendoza fields and, to a
lesser extent, also that of Malargue, are expected to decline relatively
rapidly over the next five years, tapering off thereafter and tending to
stabilize at approximately two-thirds of current production levels in the
1990s. The resulting gap in the crude supply for the Lujan de Cuyo refinery
is expected to be approximately 20,000 BPD in 1986 growing to over 50,000 BPD
by the early 1990s and to approximately 55,000 BPD by the year 2000. This gap
can be filled by production from Puesto Hernandez, a field located a further
290 km south of the Malargue (450 km from Lujan de Cuyo).
3.20     Production from Puesto Hernandez at present can be transported to the
Lujan Cuyo refinery by trucking it 220 km to Divisadero, 70 km south of
Malargue, then piping it to Malargue using an existing 16" pipeline !'; then
transhipping it partly on rail tankers and partly on tanker trucks for the
last 160 km to Lujan de Cuyo. This system is cumbersome and costly (over
US$5/barrel in transportation costs), and will increasingly affect the
economics of the Lujan de Cuyo refinery as its crude supply becomes
increasingly dependent on crude from Puesto Hernandez.
3.21     YPF proposes to complete the pipeline link between Puesto Hernandez
and Lujan de Cuyo, via Malargue, by extending the short existing pipeline 220
km towards the south (from Divisadero to Puesto Hernandez), and 160 km towards
the nc.cn (from Malargue to Lujan de Cuyo). The pipeline would have an
initial capacity of 63,000 BPD. It would operate initially (1986) at 57,000
BPD in the Malargue-Lujan de Cuyo section and at 38,000 BPD in the Puesto
Hernandez-Halargue section. Utilization of the northern section will reach
full capacity by 1989 when two new pumping stations would be added to expand
capacity to 80,000 BPD.
3.22     YPF has prepared a feasibility study of the proposed pipeline system,
according to which total investment costs would amount to US$91 million.
Total foreign exchange requirements are estimated to be approximately US$22
-million. Expanding the capacity of the pumping sations in 1989 would cost
US$8 million at 1984 prices. The present value of savings in transportation
costs over the life of the project (15 years) would amount to US$240 million
equivalent, and the financial rate of return would exceed 30%. YPF has also
carried out a sensitivity analysis of the project, assuming slower-than-
projected declines in the crude production of Mendoza fields and investment
costs exceeding extimates by 50%. Financial rates of return under these
circumstances would then be 24% and 22%, respectively.
3.23     A second pipeline investment is proposed by YPF for expansion and
rehabilitation of an existing product pipelines from Lujan de Cuyo to the
Buenos Aires area. This expansion is needed because the ongoing Refineries
Conversion Project will increase Lucan de Cuyo's production of higher-value
lighter distillates versus fuel oil. Lujan de Cuyo is about 1,000 km from San
Lorenzo and Buenos Aires, the major consuming centers of refinery products.
I/ The pipeline between Divisadero and Malargue was originally built to feed
Malargue crude to a small topping plant in Divisadero serving the local
market. The topping plant has since been closed down, and the direction of
the pipeline has been reversed.



- 45 -
There is an existing network of product pipelines from Lujan de Cuyo to San
Lorenzo and to La Matanza, a distribution center near Buenos Aires. The
project would upgrade the system's current capacity of 82,000 BPD to 113,000
BPD by removing bottlenecks which requires new storage capacity along the
pipeline's route, adding pumping stations and replacing a 90-km section of the
existing 14" pipeline with 16" pipe.
3.24     According to YPF's feasibility study of this project, the total costs
of upgrading of the pipeline system are estimated at US$65 million equivalent.
Total foreign exchange requirements are estimated to be approximately US$12
million. Returns of this investment are associated with the return of the
complete Refinery Conversion project, for which the ERR was estimated at 42X.
Compressed Natural Gas
3.25     The transport sector in Argentina accounts for approximately one-
third of total energy consumption and sixty percent of the consumption of
petroleum products. The conversion of motor vehicles to compressed natural
gas (CNG) would substitute part of the consumption of liquid fuels with
domestic natural gas, which is abundant, available at low cost and, at least
for the time being, cannot be exported. This would release crude oil and
products for export, generating corresponding foreign exchange earnings. The
feasibility of a CNG conversion program is enhanced in Argentina by the
concentration of population -- and hence of the vehicle fleet - in the Buenos
Aires area and in a few other urban centers, all of which are serviced by
natural gas pipelines. As a result, the only investments required to
implement a CNG program are a network of filling stations and th I/retrofitting
of vehicles, for which the technology exists and is well tested._
3.26     YPF has prepared estimates based on indicative Government targets as
part of a long-term plan for conversion of vehicles to CNG use. The estimates
show that conversion of about three percent of the total fleet in the country
and would eventually lead to the substitution of CNG for approximately five
million barrels per year of gasoline and diesel. This would entail conversion
of some 135,000 vehicles over a ten-year period, to be served by 370 stations
1/ CNG has been used successfully to fuel motor vehicles for over forty
years in Italy, where over 350,000 converted vehicles circulate,
served by approximately 300 refilling stations. The system has been
used for captive fleets in many countries, including the United
States, where approximately 30,000 vehicles are in service. In recent
years, Canada and New Zealand have launched programs to distribute
CNG to the public at large. In New ZeaLand 70,000 vehicles have been
converted and 150 refilling stations built in three years. CdG for
transport is being introduced on an experimental basis in several
other countries. In Bangladesh, one such experiment is being carried out
under a Bank-financed project. The technology for vehicle conversion
and filling stations is available from several-albeit relatively
few-manufacturers of different countries (notably Italy, Canada,
the US, New Zealand and Japan). The safety record of the system
is excellent.



- 46 -
utilizing a total of 550 refilling pumps. A breakdown of the types of
vehicles projected to be converted under such a plan is shown in Table 3.3.
3.27     During the beginning of the CNG program, conversion would be
concentrated on gasoline-powered taxis and trucks; private passenger cars and
diesel trucks would be converted later. While there are economically
attractive opportunities for substituting certain diesel fleets, this is more
feasible in practical terms in a later phase of development of the system
because diesel vehicle owners can be induced to incur the cost of conversion
only after a sufficiently widespread network of fillini stations is firmly
established since diesel engine conversion is more expensive than gasoline and
virtually irreversible. Furthermore, a successful program of introducing CNC
for heavy trucks and busses may have to rely on the cooperation of vehicle
manufacturers to produce CNG dedicated vehicles, Which will require time to
achieve.

3.28     The proposed project includes financing approximately 20 new and
retrofitted refilling stations (30 refilling pumps) and technical assistance
from consultants experienced in the planning, implementation and management of
CNG program. The initial group of stations would serve-as a pilot basis for
evaluating CNG use, as well as encourage CNG development by demonstration. It
is expected that taxis will be major initial users of CNa. An associated
feasibility study would include evaluation of CNG compared to other
alternative fuels (including methanol and gasoline produced from natural
gas). This study would cover user attitudes and pricing and fiscal
implications of vehicle conversion. If the feasibility study supports the CNC
alternative as the most appropriate, the conversion program would be expanded
along the lines indicated above.
3.29     The stations built by YPF under this project component would be made
available for leasing to private operators. Once a market has been
established private investors are expected to take over the further
development of the system. It is expected that it will be possible for



- 47 -
individual users to recover the cost of conversion (US$1,200-1,800 for
gasoline powered vehicles and US$2,500-4,000 for diesel powered buses and
trucks) in less than one year from fuel cost savings.
Technical Assistance to YPF
3.30     A summary of specific technical assistance components appears in
Table 3.4 following. Technical assistance to YPF would include:
(a) Review of YPF's organization and management structure,
with the objective of streamlining decision-making,
improving operational efficiency (including most effective
use of subcontractors), and assuring appropriate balance
between exploration and production activities, and field
versus headquarters responsibilities (approximately 25
man-months of consulting services, expected to be provided
primarily by export advisers at an estimated average cost
of approximately US$15,000/man-month);
(b) Improved accounting, bugeting, financiat control and
management information systems covering both at
headquarters and the decentralized regional
administrations. Detailed terms of reference for this
work would be prepared by expert advisers and tendered for
bid by systems firms by year-end 1985.  Provisions is
included for both consulting services (approximately 60
man-months of consulting services, at an estimated cost of
approximately US$12,000/man-month; an additional 60 man-
month would be funded from undisbursed amounts under the
technical assistance component of the Refinery Conversion
Project, with which this work would be integrated) and
equipment (primarily computers) for implementation of
automated systems as recommended (estimated at
US$750,000);
(c) Preparation by a technical consulting firm of a
feasibility study for the use of telecommunications
equipment for automated remote field production
management, and for installation of such equipment
(approximately 100 man-months at an estimated cost of
US$12,000/man-month), and acqusition of such equipment
(estimated at US$1,600,000);
(d) Developing a medium and long-term investment program and
priorities and defining the appropriate level of
investment required to assure the country's self-
sufficiency in crude oil production. Work in this area
would help define more precisely the borrower's role in
the future development of the sector and the level of
investment to be undertaken by YPF in complementing the
exploration activities of private oil companies. It is
expected that this work would be undertaken primarily by

expert advisers (approximately 25 man-months of consulting
services at an estimated cost of approximately 15,000/man-
month);
(e)  Assistance in selected technical operations by advising
YPF's operating staff on specific problems. Assistance
would include such areas as marketing of exports
overseas. Provision has been made for approximately 60
man-month of assistance (at approximately US$10,000/man-
month); and for associated equipment (primarily computers
and laboratory equipment associated with analytical work),
estimated at US$600,000;
(f) Training associated with each of these components (65 man-
month of assistance at an estimated cost of US$12,000/man-
month), and associated equpment (estimated at US$400,000).
Technical Assistance to the Government
3.31     Assistance in energy sector planning would be provided, consisting of
consulting services to the recently created planning team of the Energy
Secretariat. The Secretariat has an agenda of specific studies which it
wishes to pursue, and which would be undertaken with support from this
component. This component is described in more detail in Annex VII.
3.32     The Government of Argentina has agreed to submit a work program for
this component to the Bank by December 31, 1985. This will include a list of
topics on which specific studies wilL be financed under the component, as well
as other support to the Secretariat's planning efforts. Specific terms of
reference for each specialized study, as the Secretariat will propose then to
the Bank during implementation, will be agreed with the Bank as condition of
disbursement.
Project Cost
3.33     Project cost estimates are sunmarized in Table 3.5 below, and
detailed in Annex IV. For the Northern Production and Transmission System,
cost estimates are based on YPF figures which are based in turn on quotations
received by YPF in mid-1984 from manufactures and consultants. For the other
components cost estimates are based on studies carried out by YPF and
consultants to YPF.
3.34     Base cost estimates are expressed in December 1984 prices.  Price
contingencies are 5 percent for 1985, 7.5 percent for 1986 and 8 percent for
1987 through 1989. Physical contingencies are estimated at 1OZ for all of the
components.
Financing Plan and Disbursement
3.35     There has been no indication of willingness on the part of foreign
banks to commit funds to Argentina additional to the obligatory new funds
being negotiated as part of the rescheduling of Argentina's external debt.

Accordingly, no cofinancing is foreseen for this project, and it is
recomoended IBRD finance 100 percent of the total estimated foreign currency
costs of those components of the proposed project being financed by the Bank.

3.36     YPF and the Government of Argentina will be responsible for
mobiliz.ing the domestic and foreign currency resources to finance the local
cost of these components as well as field development and the expansion of the
capacity of the existing gas pipeline. A condition of disbursement of this
component will be that GdE has entered into arrangements ft: thi, financing of
the North Pipeline capacity expansion satisfactory to the Bank.-   In order to
expedite preparation of engineering studies for the various project
components, it is recommended that retroactive financing for up to US$5
million be permitted.
3.37     Bank financing of U3$180 million is recommended, representing
approximately 22 percent of total project cost. The proposed Bank loan
includes US$18.9 million to finance the foreign exchange component of
estimated interest during construction on execution of the various Bank-
financed components.
3.38     In order to facilitate disbursement, and in particular to expedite
the availability of foreign exchange to YPF to meet direct import costs as
incurred, it is proposed that disbursement be made against 100 percent of the
cost of imported goods or services and against 20 percent of locaLly procured
goods or services except for local expenditures incurred in connection with
Campo Duran and for technical assistance. For local costs incurred in
connection with Campo Duran, disbursements would be made against a slightly
greater portion of local costs, 30 percent, reflecting the slightly more
import-intensive ratio of this construction work. For technical assistance to
YPF, disbursement will be made against 100 percent of foreign exchange costs,
and for technical assistance to the Government against 100 percent of total
costs. Disbursement for interest during construction would be made against
interest charged on Bank funds until utilized to the extent allocated.
3.39     There is no standard disbursement schedule for petroleum projects and
in particular for one with the components included in the project proposed.
Disbursements ma} be expected to be expedited by providing for disbursement
against direct foreign exchange costs as incurred. Assuming conservatively on
average a six-month lag between the time expenditures are incurred and actual
disbursements by the Bank, prospective disbursement of Bank funds would be as
shown in Table 3.6 below. The profile conforms to actual disbursement
experience for Bank projects in the energy sector.

3.40     Two revolving funds, one foreign exchange expenditures special
account and one peso expenditures special account, totalling US$15 million,
equivalent to three-four months' anticipated disbursements, will be
established with the Banco de la Nacion to assure expeditious disbursement.
Supporting documentation will be submitted to the Bank for replenishment of
the fund. A closing date of December 31, 1990 is proposed.
Project Status and ImpLementation
3.41     YPF will be responsible for implementation of the project, except for
the technical assistance component for energy planning, which will be
implemented by the Secretariat of Energy.
3.42     Field Development of the Aguarague fields v1ll be carried out by
YPF on its own account. Relatively little direct foreign exchange resources
will be required for this work, which will be provided by YPF. Additional
drilling is not expected to be necessary until 1989. The Ramos and Acambuco
fields, both privately operated, will be developed by private sector
contractors. The basic design for drilling and the installation of wellhead
facilties and flow Lines in Aguarague (by YPF) and similar developments in the
Ramos and Acambuco fields (by private operators under contract to YPF) have
been reviewed by Stone and Webster and would be submitted to the Bank at
negotiations. While plans for implementation of field development by the
private sector operators are adequate, reserves are sufficient in those areas
being developed by YPF to assure supply for the project even in the event
production from the private sector were not developed as projected.
3.43     Expansion of the Campo Duran Liquid Recovery System - Basic design
for the Campo Duran work and facilities has been prepared by YPF. Design will
be reviewed by consulting process engineers acceptable to the Bank prior to
issuance of tender documents which is normal practice in turnkey procurement
of this type of plant. Terms of reference for the process engineers will be
agreed with the Bank at negotiations. The contracts for detailed engineering,
procurement and execution of construction will be awarded on a turnkey basis
through international competitive bidding. Bidders for the turnkey contract
will be prequalified.
3.44     Because of the need for coordination among various units of YPF as
well as private operators and GdE, YPF has agreed to create a Project Unit for
the Campo Duran work along the same lines as the unit created for the Refinery
Conversion Project. The Project Unit will be set up within the Gas Production
Department. YPF maintains a local headquarters at Tartagal, near Campo
Duran. It is expected that most of the site supervision will be handled by
this staff under supervision of the central Project Unit. Given the expertise
of YPF in this type of project, these arrangements are reasonable. Progress
of the work would be reviewed periodically at joint meetings of the various
parties involved including the Bank and the 1DB.
3.45     Gas Debottlenecking and Enhanced Oil Recovery Pilot Projects -
Appraisal of individual gas debottlenecking projects will be done by YPF
according to appraisal criteria to be agreed with the Bank at negotiations and

submitted to the Bank for approval. Disbursement will be on a subproject
basis. Criteria for evaluation of subproject applications, besides the
project being consistent with optimization of overall oil and gas use, will
include: economic rate of return in ezcess of 15Z, and financing for no single
subproject to exceed US$10 million equivalent without prior approval of the
Bank. It is estimated that the average total project cost will be
approximately US$7.5 million equivalent, of which approximately one-half would
be foreign exchange.  On this basis it is expected four-six projects would be
submitted under this line.
3.46     Feasibility studies for enhanced oil recovery operations in the ten
fields designated by YPF will be undertaken by consultants to be agreed with
the Bank. The feasibility studies will be reviewed by YPF and the Bank and
based on these studies financing of each pilot project will be approved on a
one-by-one basis. Disbursement will be approved for each pilot project; it is
estimated ten pilots will be undertaken.
3.47     Lujan de Cuyo.  Basic engineering for the construction of the crude
oil pipeline from Puesto Hernandez to Lujan de Cuyo and for the upgrading of
the product pipeline systems from Lujan de Cuyo to La Matanza is being carried
out by YPF. It will be submitted to the Bank by January 1986, together with
full appraisaL reports of the two projects. The appraisal will have to
demonstrate that the pipeline projects meet the same eligibility criteria as
the gas debottlenecking projects. Bank approval of the projects wilL be a
condition of disbursement for this component. Following Bank approval, the
pipeline projects will be implemented by YPF.
3.48     Compressed Natural Gas - A number of agencies are already involved in
initial implementation of CNG for vehicle uses. In August 1984, the Secretary
of Energy approved technical and public safety standards for regulating the
use of CNG. These standards are comparable to those being applied in other
countries with experience in the use of CNG for transport (notably Italy and
New Zealand). Gas del Estado is responsible for ensuring strict compliance
with these standards. Gas del Estado is responsible for planning,
organization and administration of CNG use. YPF will be responsible for
initiating its communication, and the private sector for vehicle conversion,
construction of facilities and retailing. A first experimental filling
station was inaugurated in December 1984. It is the policy of the Government
to encourage the private sector to take over development of the CNG market
after its initial viability has been established.
3.49     To proceed with implementation of CNG use on a pilot basis, YPF has
agreed to designate a CNC Project Unit staffed in a manner acceptable t? the
Bank and contract technical assistance from an experienced CNG operator-/ for
planning, implementation and monitoring of the system. The CNG Project Unit
1/ Caltex (California) has been primarily responsible for the CNG program
New Zealand and SNAM (Milan) for CNG distribution in Italy. These
companies would be principal candidates for such assistance.



- 54 -
and the consultants will prepare a rolling multi-year implementation plan
which will be submitted to the Bank for review.
3.50     The Government has also agreed to establish not later than
September 30, 1985 a Steering Committee including representatives of the
public and private sectors to monitor implementation of the program. The Bank
would be an observer member of this Committee. Nomination of the Project Unit
and the Steering Committee members, and appointment of the consul-ants,
together with submission of the initial plan for implementation acceptable to
the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement for this component. In
addition, assurances have been obtained that the Government of Argentina would
provide approyyiate incentives to facilitate the acquisition of conversion
kits for CNGG._   The Government of Argentina together with YPF, has agreed to
review progress of this component on an annual basis.
3.51     Tentative project implementation schedules for each of the components
described above are outlined in Table 3.7, on the following page.
3.52     Technical Assistance - The technical assistance component to YPF will
be implemented by YPF. YPF's management has agreed to designate a comittee
to overview the execution of this component of the project. A schedule for
preparation of detailed terms of reference for the individual consulting
components to be undertaken is shown in Table 3.4. YPF will be expected to
appoint counterpart staff to work with the consultants on each component.
Progress in the execution of the technical assistance will be reviewed jointly
by the Bank and the YPF supervisory committee on a regular basis.
3.53     Technical assistance for energy planning will be implemented by the
Secretariat of Energy on the basis of an agreement with YPF by which YPF would
transfer the amount allocated for this component to the Secretariat of
Energy. Specific studies to be financed under this component and terms of
reference for each study will be reviewed by the Bank on a case-by-case basis.
Agreement on the terms of reference for each study and on the qualification
and mode of selection of the consultants to carry out each study would be
reached with the Bank prior to disbursement. Progress under this component
would be reviewed during the course of regular discussions to be held with the
Government on energy pricing policy, the sector investment program and related
matters.
Procurement
3.54     Expansion of Campo Duran Liquid Recovery System - The equipment and
materials for production separators and oil and gas gathering lines to be
installed in the field, estimated at US$38 million, will be procured by ICB
for items cociting more than US$500,000. It is likely YPF will use some items
available in its own stock for expediency. In such cases an equivalent amount
of equipment will be procured under ICB to replenish stock.
1/ Amendments to an existing loan through BANADE for private sector use
under discussion include provision for working carital financing and
financing of energy related services, which could include importation,
distribution, sale and installation of CNG Conversion Units.

as civil works contracts under this project component will be under ICB,
except for specialized items such as telecommunications equipment, total value
of which is estimated at US$10 million, which will be procured under LIB.
Agreement has been reached with the Government of Argentina that if
procurement of pipe and civil works are limited to local contractors, the
portion of loan proceeds corresponding to the estimated indirect foreign
exchange component of these contracts (approximately US$20 million) would be
cancelled. In this case, the Bank would finance specific items to be directly
imported by YPF for the subprojects (costing about US$14 million) provided
they are procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
3.60     CGC Utilization - Most of the Bank-financed procurement will be for
C'C equipment used to equip stations.  Given the limited number of suppliers
and the need to diversify sources of supply for testing programs, most
procurement under this component will be under LIB.
3.61     Technical Assistance -  Consulting services under the technical
assistance components to YPF and the Government of Argentina will be awarded
according to Bank guidelines.
3.62     All works, material and equipment contracts for over US$1.0 million
will be subject to review by the Bank.
3.63     Procurement for expansion of the pipeline capacity, to be financed by

Ecology and Safety
3.64      The project will involve minimal ecological disruptions:
(a)  Expansion of the Northern Transmission Systems will
require excavation during construction but the Land will
be reclaimed after completion.  Design of the liquid
recovery plant will include alL necessary facilities to
avoid water and air pollution. Contract specifications
will be reviewed by the Bank to assure that they meet API
safety standards or the equivalent;
(b) Design of debottlenecking and enhanced oil recovery pilot
projects will be reviewed by the Bank before approval and



- 58 -
for specific assurances that drilling and exploration
procedures conform to World Bank guidelines for health and
safety;
(c) Specifications for the Lujan de Cuyo pipelines will be
reviewed by the Bank to assure that they conform to API
safety standards or the equivalent as a part of the
process for Bank approval for disbursement of this
component;
(d) The CNG component should contribute significantly to a
reduction of air pollution in the Buenos Aires area
through the use of natural gas, which is a non-
pollutant. Safety standards for vehicles and refilling
stations have been set by Gas del Estado, which will also
be responsible for monitoring their observance. These
have been reviewed by the Bank and have been found to be
consistent with international experience.
Reporting Requirements
3.65     YPF will provide the Bank with quarterly progress reports covering
technical progress of the project including procurement status and funds
committed and spent. A completion report will be submitted at the end of the
project.
PART IV - Justification
4.1      The proposed project would support the substitution of natural gas
for petroleum products in the transport, power, industrial and residential
sectors. As constraints on oil and associated gas production are removed with
the expansion of the Northern Gas Pipeline, significant additional volumes of
oil, gas and natural gas liquids would be produced.
4.2      Facilities at the Campo Duran liquid recovery and reinjection plant
by the Bank financed under this project would extracs approximately an
additional 165,000 tons per year of LPG and 74,000 m of natural gasoline for
export, as well as prevent flaring of 100 MNCFD of excess natural gas by
reinjection. Field development, to be financed by YPF together with the
private sector operators involved, would increase the production of natural
gas and associated condensate by 120 MMCFD and 3,500 BD respectively. The
expansion of the Northern Pipeline System, to be financed by the IDB, will
permit the substitution of additional natural gas for fuel oil, LPC and
kerosene in different sectors of economy.
4.3      The economic rate of return of the integrated project -  including
the Campo Duran liquid recovery and reinjection, field development and
expansion of the Northern Pipeline System - is estimated to be over 37
percent (including physical contingencies in the cost stream) and over 41
percent (excluding physical contingencies).



- 59 -
Expansion of the Nortbern Transmission System
4.4       The liquid recovery and reinjection facilities at Campo Duran have
been evaluated in economic terms both as a component of the integrated project
and separately on a stand-alone basis.
4.5      On the basis of the integrated project, the benefits include
additional natural gas, which would displace mainly fuel oil. These benefits
are calculated on the basis of the FOB-equivalent value of fuel oil, net of
gas distribution costs and switching costs from fuel oil to gas. Additional
benefits derive from the value of the liquids extracted (propane, butane, and
natural gasoline). These are also valued at FOB-equivalent. The volume of
condensate (API 50-55o) produced in association with the gas is valued at the
FOB price of stablized light naphtha. Finally, elimination of flared gas is
valued at the estimated depletion value of gas.
4.6      Evaluating the Campo Duran facilities on a stand-alone basis, costs
and benefits are related only to the project component to be financed by the
Bank: that is, the separators, gas gathering lines, liquid recovery plant and
reinjection compressors. Benefits are based on the additional volume of LPG
and natural gasoline produced and avoidance of flaring through reinjection,
valued as above.
4.7      The installation of an ethane recovery unit, at a cost of US$8.7
mi-lion (including contingencies), would permit the production of an
additional 270,000 tons per year of ethane. Ethane is valued at the FOB price
of ethane in the US Gulf coast, net of transportation costs from Buenos Aires
to the Gulf.
4.8      Based on the above assumptions the ERR for the integrated project is
estimated to be 37 percent including ethane recovery and 34 percent excluding
costs and benefits related to ethane. The Campo Duran facilities as a stand-
alone project is estimated to have an ERR of 30 percent including ethane
recovery and 22 percent excluding costs and benefits related to ethane.
Gas Debottlenecking and Enhanced Oil Recovery
4.9      Funds under the proposed project would be allocated for a number of
gas debottlenecking projects and enhanced oil recovery pilot projects. With
respect to the gas debottlenecking projects, typical benefits would include
increased condensate and LPC production as well as decreases in flaring of
gas. A preliminary evaluation of several possible projects using border
prices and the depletion value of gas indicates expected economic rates of
return exceeding 80 percent.
4.10     With respect to enhanced oil recovery pilot projects, it is difficult
to calculate an economic returns. However, the oiL recovery factor using
conventional techniques of oil production Argentina is approximately 17
percent. It would not be unrealistic to estimate that up to 30 percent
recovery factors could be achieved with the use of proper enhanced recovery
techniques. For the entire country this would suggest additional recoverable
reserves of over 2.5 billion barrels, approximately equal to the amount
remaining to be recovered by conventional techniques.



- 60 -
4.11     The EOI piLot project component is designed to permit identifying the
least-cost oil available from enhanced oil recovery techniques; to utilize
these techniques in least-cost fields first; and (together with the training
component) to develop the skills and techniques within YPF to apply them. In
instances where per-barrel costs are estimated to be higher than from
alternative sources, use of such techniques would be deferred until
economically justified.
Lujan de Cuyo Pipelines
4.12     Construction of the crude pipeline to Lujan de Cuyo will reduce
average per-barrel transportation costs by an estimated US$5/barrel. Based on
average projected volumes ranging from approximately 50,000 BPD to 70,000 BPD,
the average annual savings for this project component would be of the order of
US$50 million. Operating costs would not be expected to exceed US$8 million
annually. In addition, the crude supply pipeline will assure continuity of
supply and reduce associated storage costs.
4.13     Savings in operating costs expected from rehabilitation of the-
product pipeline from Lujan de Cuyo to the Buenos Aires area are similar in
magnitude. Upgrading of the product pipeline could not be replaced by
alternative transportation modes without substantial investment in rolling
stock, loading and unloading facilities, which further increases the economic
return of the investment. Detailed analysis of the economic returns of the
pipeline projects will be presented in the full appraisal reports which YPF
will submit to the Bank for its approval prior to disbursement.
Compressed Natural Gas
4.14     The CNG conversion program as planned would convert 103,000 gasoline
and 32,000 diesel-powered cars over a period of ten years. CNG would replace
almost five million barrels per year of liquid hydrocarbons. To supply this
volume of CNG, it is estimated that 366 refilling stations would need to be
built.
4.15     In the economic evaluation of the proposed project, benefits are
based on the value of fuels replaced by CNG. The economic rate of return on
this project component is very high, reflecting the low economic cost of
transmission and distribution of gas and the high value of fuels displaced. A
rate of return of over 50 percent (over a 10-year period, and including
physical contingencies) has been estimated on this component; returns exceed
55 percent excluding physical contingencies. Details and assumptions are
shown in Annex VIII, attached.
Risks
4.16     Oil and gas projects such as the proposed project typically carry
risks regarding reserves and deliverability, market risks, delays in project
completion, and operating risks.
4.17     The reserves of oil and gas as well as deliverability of the fields
and the market for gas have been ascertained in the Stone and Webster Gas
Optimization Study and in specific studies carried out by YPF and Gas del
Estado.



- 61 -
4.18     The market for the volume of ethane to be produced by the ethane
recovery unit at Campo Duran, 270,000 tons per year, is uncertain.
Installation of the unit is modular and a decision on its acquisition will not
be necessary for approximately two years, by which point the market potential
for this product can be more thoroughly reviewed. Excluding ethane from the
benefit stream of the Campo Duran project would reduce the economic rate of
return by about 3 percent for the integrated project and by about 8 percent
for the liquid recovery and reinjection project alone. A delay of one year in
the construction of the pipeline would reduce the above returns by 4 to
5 percent.
4.19     The liquid recovery plant at Campo Duran would utilize well-
established technology. Basic design and project supervision would be carried
out by YPF staff, who are qualified and experienced with respect to such
projects. YPF is already operating one such plant at Campo Duran without
operational difficulties.
4.20     In the case of CNG, the technology is also established and the market
estimates realistic. However, due to lack of experience in a new program of
this nature, project management would be assisted by an experienced firm. The
project would be implemented in defined phases with frequent review of
implementation. This review process should serve to minimize risks.
4.21     Refilling station import costs might vary by 20-30 percent.  This
would result in ERR's ranging from 39 percent (if over) to 64 percent (if
under). The estimates are based on conversion costs of US$1,800 per vehicle
converted, including contingencies as estimated by YPF. These costs appear
conservative based on experience in other countries where average conversion
costs typically are US$300-400 less per vehicle. Ecoy7mic returns based on
these lower conversion costs would be over 55 percent-.
4.22     It is important to the success of the CNG program that the
prospective financial return to station operators, who are prospective lessors
of the CNG equipment financed under this component, be appropriate. These
returns have been estimated based on the following:
(a)     Station facilities costing US$300,000 leased by YPF to
operators at a financial cost of 15%;
(b)     Average operating costs of US$24,000 per year;
(c)     Distributor margin of 10% of retail price; and
(d)     Sales of 85 MMCF of CNG per year per station.
4.23     Based on these assumptions, distributors would need a margin of about
US$0.90 per MCF of natural gas sold in order to cover their total costs
including a profit margin of 10 percent. If the number of cars served by each
1/ A separate evaluation of this project component, based on actual refilling
station costs in the United States (US$150,000-220,000 vs US$300,000
estimated by YPF) and vehicle conversion costs in Italy (US$1,000-2,500
per vehicle vs an average of US$1,800 per vehicle estimated by YPF)
results in ERRs approaching 100 percent.



- 62 -
station were 50 percent less, the required margin per MCF of gas sold would
increase to US$1.50-2.00 per NCF.
4.24     Given a retail sales price of CNG at 45 percent of the energy
equivalent of super gasoline, or US$7.50 per MCF of gas equivalent, and given
an estimated cost of transmission and distribution of natural gas in Argentina
of US$1.25 per MCF, the above distributor margin allows fGr a margin for price
and tax adjustments of US$4.40-5.40 per MCF of gas equivalent. If the station
cost is overestimated by 20-30 percent, the above margin would increase to
US$4.60 - 5.60 per MCF of gas equivalent.
4.25     Based on these figures there is adequate margin to allow both for
sufficient returns to distributors and to apply appropriate revenue-raising
taxes required by the Government.
PART V - AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Agreements Reached
5.1      During loan negotiations, agreements was reached on the following:
(a) With the Government of Argentina regarding:
;)      The relative price structure at the retail level of
petroleum products. The Government has agreed to
increase the relative retail prices of diesel to 55
percent of the price of regular gasoline and fuel
oil to 33 percent of the price of regular gasoline
over a fifteen-month period ending September 30,
1986; and of diesel and fuel oil to 70 percent and
40 percent respectively, of the price of regular
gasoline by January 1, 1988 (paras. 1.42, 1.43);
(ii)    Relative pricing of CNG.  Retail price levels of
CNG will be set in a manner sufficient to assure
adequate incentive to convert motor vehicles
(gasoline and diesel powered) for CNG use; and the
wholesale price of CNG will be set to assure
adequate margins net of taxes for the financial
viability of refilling operations. The
Government's stated objective of pricing CNG at 45Z
of the energy-equivalent cost of super gasoline
would be acceptable with respect to gasoline for
these purposes; (para. 1.44);
(iii)   General pricing policy.  The Government and the
Bank shall exchange views on the appropriateness of
energy prices not later than October 31 each year
(paras. 1.45, 3.53);



- 63 -
(iv)    Revenues to YPF net of taxation.  Average revenues
to YPF net of fuel excise taxes and other taxes and
royalties will be adequate to permit YPF to earn
net profits, based on efficient operations, of at
least six percent on the company's net fixed
revalued assets (para. 2.45);
(v)     CNG Steering Committee and Implementation.  The
Government will establish a Steering Committee to
oversee execution of the CNG component by
September 30, 1985, and appoint representatives
from Transport and Industry, YPF, Gas del Estado,
and other public and private entities concerned to
the Committee; assure that the Committee meets on a
regular basis; and assume that the Committee
considers the reports prepared by the consultants
employed by YPF to assist is carrying out this
component; (para. 3.50);
(vi)    CNG conversion and policy.  Appropriate incentives
would be provided by the Government to facilitate
the acquisition of CNG conversion kits. The
Government has also assured that appropriate
incentives would be provided to encourage private
ownership and operation of CNG refilling facilities
(para. 3.50);
(vii)   Energy planning.  The Government will enter into an
agreement with YPF by which it will borrow from YPF
up to US$2.0 million equivalent of the proceeds of
the proposed loan, and assume responsibility for
the service of this part of the loan. Funds under
this component will be utilized by the Secretariat
of Energy for energy planning purposes. A detailed
work plan and timetable for utilization of these
funds will be submitted to the Bank by December 31,
1985 (paras. 3.31, 3.32, 3.53).

(ii)    Periodic review, at least annually, of YPF's
projected investment program on a multi-year basis,
including oil and gas exploration and development,
coordination of YPF's investment plans with those
of the private sector and measures to encourage and
facilitate such investment by the private sector
(para. 2.37).
(c) With YPF regarding:

(i)     Financing for expansion of the capacity of the
Northern Gas Pipeline. Arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank for financing of the expansion of the
Northern Gas Pipeline will be substantially
completed prior to disbursement for the Campo Duran
liquid recovery facilities (paras. 3.36);
(ii)    Campo Duran.  Basic design of separators, gathering
oil and gas lines, and the liquid recovery plant
will be reviewed by consulting process engineers
acceptable to the Bank and submitted for review by
the Bank before tender documents are issued for

Campo Duran Project Unit staffed in a manner
acceptable to the Bank (para. 3.42);
(iii)   Subproject disbursement.  Disbursement by the Bank
for subprojects for gas debottlenecking and
enhanced oil recovery will be subject to review and
approval by the Bank of subproject applications
submitted by YPF. Preparation of guidelines foe
subprojects to be submitted which would assure that
individual projects contribute to optimization
system-wide acceptable to the Bank will be required
prior to disbursement under this category.
Criteria for evaluation of subproject applications,
besides the project being consistent with
optimization of overall oil and gas use, will
include: economic rate of return in excess of 15%,
and financing for no single subproject to exceed
US$10 million without prior agreement with the Bank
(paras. 3.45);
(iv)    CNG implementation.  YPF will designate a CGN
Project Unit staffed in a manner acceptable to the

Conversion Project (Loan 2032-AR), including
specifically:
A. Quick ratio not to fall below 0.8:1 in any year
in which new borrowings take place (or dividends
are paid), or below 0.6:1 in any other year
(para. 2.42);
B. Debt:equity ratio not to exceed 60:40;
(para. 2.43); and
C. Debt-service ratio to be maintained above 1.4:1
(para 2.44).
For the purpose of evaluating the above ratios, the
Bank would include certain amounts under the
Government's commitment to support YPF's debt
service payments (paras. 2.42-2.44); and
(vii)   Reports.  YPF would furnish to the Bank financial
statements including its projected investmeht
program annu'Lly, and discussior. of these reports
would be included in the period.c review with the
Government provided under (b)(ii) above (para.
2.46). During project implementation, short
quarterly progress reports will be submitted to the
Bank (para. 3.47).
5.2          The following would be a condition for effectiveness of the
proposed loan:
(a) The Government to pass regulations for the implementation
of its commitment to meet payments of YPF's foreign debt
by approximately US$3.3 billion equivalent, including
provisions that:
The commitment be adjusted to maintain at least the dollar-
equivalent value of the original amount;
(ii) The undisbursed balance of the commitment will yield
interest at a rate equal to at least the average
dollar-equivalent cost of YPF's outstanding foreign
debt; and
(iii) Disbursements will be made to YPF against this
commitment in a manner matching YPF's debt service
obligations (including as such obligations may be
amended, in accordance with the rescheduling of
Argentina's external debt) (paras. 2.29 and 2.30).
Recommendation
5.3      The proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$180 million to YPF with the Guarantee of the Republic of Argentina
on standard IBRD terms and conditions applicable to commercially-oriented
borrowers in Argentina.

Natural Gas in Argentina
Results of the Argentina Gas Utilization Study
I.1      Under Loan 1880-AR (1980) to YPF, a Gas Utilization Study was
undertaken by the Stone & Webster Engineering Co under the supervision of the
Secretariat of Energy (Subsecretariat of Fuels). The results of the study
became available end-1984 and have been reviewed by the Bank.
I.2      The fundamental conclusions of the study are:
(a) Argentina is likely to have sufficient oiL and gas reserves
to supply domestic demand well into the next century;
(b) Almost all gas is expected to be associated with oil. As
gas is produced from fields with increasing gas-oil ratios,
the volumes of gas produced as a consequence of oil
production levels necessary to supply domestic demand will
greatly exceed domestic demand and export possibilities;
and
(c) The major potential customer for excess gas is the power
sector.
I.3      These conclusions depend importantly upon the amount of reserves
available at a cost less than the equivalent cost of international crude
oil. The study itself is based on a detailed review of geological formations
in Argentina's producing basins and a review of3reserve estimates. Ihe
potential oil reserves estimated weSe 1,234 MMm3 compares to 386 MHm  in 1982
for petroleum and 2,500 billion MM. compared to 691 MMm in 1982 for gas.
I.4      Based on an average rate of GDP growth of approximately 4 percent
between 1984 and 2000, and taking into account potential substitution in
industry, exports to Brazil (the biggest potential export customer), and
increased gas pipeline iifrastructure, the study concludes that by the year
2000 nearly 23 billion m of gas would still have to be fLared. This figure
corresponds to 28 percent of projected total production.
I.5      These conclusions are reproduced in a simple framework highlighting
the key variables in the following. The 1983 energy balance produced by the
Secretariat of Energy as an accounting framework to explore alternative
scenarios. Two different scenarios illustrate the policy choices at issue.

I.6      In the first scenario only proven reserves are taken into ac  unt.
The share of gas increases from 26 to 34 percent of final consumption-
(including the energy sector's own consumption) by 1995 and the share of
petroleum products decreases from 49 percent to 41 percent by 1995. In
electricity gener4tion, the 1983 shares of fuel remain constant. Gas exports
rising to 6.2 MMm  per day of gas by 1995 are assumed.  About 4,250 MTOE of
gas would be flared in 1995.
I.7      In the second scenario potential reserves are taken into account.
The share of gas increases from 26 percent to 39 percent of final consumption
by the year 2015 and petroleum products drop to 33 percent from their present
49 percent. Gas increases its share in power generation from 35 to 70
percent; hydro remains at 19 percent; nuclear decreases from 9 to 3 percent;
and di sel and fuel oils decline from 31 to 2 percent. Exports oi gas rise to
62 M&m /d per year by 2015. About 1,300 MTOE of gas would still be flared by
2015.
1/ Final consumption comprieses all sectors of the economy but excludes
transformation and transmission losses or flaring of gas.

I.8      In both scenarios GDP is assumed to grow at 4 percent per year, the
j?come elasticity of energy consumption is assumed to decrease from 1 to 0.8
1 and the gas-oil ratio is expected to rise at 4.3 percent per year compared
to 4.7 percent between 1970 and 1983. Both scenarios assume that the speed of
substitution would not drastically depart from past trends, as shown below:

1.9     Scenario I is essentially represents a continuation of present
policies. Gas would continue to substitute for petroleum products in final
demand of the industrial and the residential sector. In power generation,
this scenario assumes a higher gas utilization than the present power
expansion plan which would increase the share of nuclear and hydro.
1.10    Scenario II assumes a continuous substitution program of gas for
petroleum product in industry, the residential sector and also in power, where
it would reach 70 percent of generation by 2015. Substitution of gas for
gasoline and diesel is also foreseen for the transport sector.
I.11    The principle difference as summarized below is that under Scenario I
oil would last until 1995 and remaining gas reserves would suffice for another
14 years of consumption at 1995 consumption rates. Under Scenario II oil
would last until 2017 and remaining gas reserves would last another 7 years at
consumption rates of 2015.
1/ A: elasticity of demand for energy in relation to national income of 0.8
has been achieved by several developed countries, through energy
conservation measures.

Issues Arising from the Gas Utilization Scenarios
I.12     The required investment programs differ between the two scenarios.
The trade-off is between large hydroprojects and extended gas
infrastructure. Investments in gas infrastructure would be less costly than
hydropower expansion in Scenario II, because the resulting economic cost of
gas would be less than US$1.50 per MCF compared to over US$4.00 per MCF
assumed in the power expansion plan presently in force. Furthermore,
investments in gas infrastructure would be less bulky and more continuous.
I.13     The basic strategy to be chosen depends importantly on the view of
oil and gas reserves. Long-range energy planning based on only proven reserve
would clearly be conservative, whereas the expected value of oil and gas
reserves estiwated in the Stone & Webster Study does not provide an assessment
of the possible variance of the estimate. It would therefore be useful to
undertake a detailed geological review of oil and gas endowment using
probabilistic methods (such as the RASP model presently under development at
the Bank or available from the U.S. Department of Energy). Based on such a
review, the expected benefits of alternative energy policies could be better
assessed.
Oil and Cas Reservoir Management
1.14     Under-the above scenarios gas would be flared even if-major
substitution and export programs are undertaken. How much flaring would
actually take place depends not only on substitution possibilities in the
economy and potential export markets, but also on reservoir management
techniques, which could contain the growth of the gas/oil ratio.
I.15     Reservoir management should take the cost into account which is
immosed on the economy by flaring gas. For example, production of high-cost
oil fields with a low gas-oil ratio would to some extent be preferable to
producing low-cost oil from fields, which would produce large amounts of
gas. Typical cases would be oil production from offshore fields in the



- 70 -
Austral basin, which have a lower gas-oil ratio than onsnore fields in the
same basin or enhanced recovery from fields in the Cuyana basin, which has a
low gas-oil ratio. As is already practiced, fieLds with high gas-oil ratios
should be shut in and exploration should focus on areas where the expected
gas-oil ratios are low.
I.16     In practice the planning of a detailed program of reservoir
management is a highly complex task and fraught with uncertainty. The
Stone/Webster study, however, allows for planning of the outlines of such a
program based on a dynamic programing model. More detailed planning would
have to complement such an outline program. For such detailed planning it
would be necessary to have an idea of the value of gas in the ground. Every
unit of gas flared would then be charged as a cost to the producing company.
The Value of Gas and its Economic Price
I.17     The value of gas in the ground would in principle be determined in
the following way. Every unit of gas flared today could have been used at a
later date instead of some substitute fuel, for example nonassociated gas or
fuel oil. The value of this substitute fuel discounted to the present time
would be the value of gas in the ground. One estimate of this value, also
called depletion value, is calculated in this Annex.
I.18     On the supply side, almost all of the gas is associated with oil or
condensates in Argentina. Given a border price for oil a producer will
produce oil up to the point, where the price of oil is equal to the marginal
cost of production. In the process a certain quantity of gas will be produced
as indicated by the gas-oil ratio. Based on the gas optimization study
mentioned above, this production is expected to exceed demand including
exports.
I.19.    This suggests that the Argentinian situation can be described as
follows: Consumers paying no more than the long run average incremental cost
of transmission and distribution would still demand less gas than is projected
to be produced. As a result, the difference between gas supply and demand
would be flared. In the near future, this would happen even though the price
of oil in Argentina is set below the border price just high enough to supply
the domestic market for petroleum products.
I.20.    The present oil and gas price system does not encourage a reduction
in flaring. However, YPF is not paid for flared gas and a decree by the
Secretariat of Energy forbids all flaring from fields gas/oil ratios wit'-
above 100 m of gas per m of oil, unless special op rational problems such as
low pressure or high CO2 or sulphur contents occur. Both YPF and private
contractors have therefore shut down most wells with high gas/oil ratio. In
principle, this administrative approach to the flaring issue could be replaced
by charging the value of flared gas as a cost to the respective producers.
I.21.    In this case, the consumer should not pay the depletion value,
whereas producers should include it as a cost in making investment and
production decisions. It would then be advantageous to explore for and
produce higher cost oil with low gas-oil ratios, for example by using enhanced
recovery techniques or drilling offshore fields with low gas-oil ratios.



- 71 -
Depletion Calculation
I.22.    In the following, a basic methodology is presented to assess the
value of gas in the ground complementing the calculations of Annex -. This
would enable planners to determine in a general way when it is worth leaving
gas in the ground, even though it means not producing oil. In its simplest
form, the method compares (a) leaving the joint product "oil-gas" in the
ground and importing the oil needed today to (b) producing the joint product
today, flaring the gas today and importing oil in the future, combined with
the production of nonassociated gas.
I.23.    It is assumed that the international price of oil today is US$27 per
barrel and that it rises at 2 percent per annum in real terms. The gas-oil
ratio is 0.6 on a heat-equivalent basis and the production cost of the joint
product US$16 per barrel. The cost of oil production is assumed to remain
constant in real terms and the cost of nonassociated gas to also remain
constant and correspond to US$11 per barrel of oil equivalent or about US$2
per MCF. It is further assumed that oil and associated gas reserves run out
in the year 2015. These assumptions reflect average values in Argentina
today.
I.24.    If oil and gas are produced now, US$16 is spent, based on one barrel
of oil and 0.6 "barrels" of gas flared. In 2015 it would then be necessary to
import an additional barrel of crude and produce 0.6 "barrels" of gas. If,
however, the joint product is left in the ground today, a barrel of oil would
be imported today and use of the full joint product would be available in the
year 2015. The net benefits of producing today would be US$27 (import of oil)
minus US$16 (producing the oil and flaring the gas), or US$11. The net costs
would be US$49 (import of oil in the future), plus US$6.60 (producing 0.6
"barrels" of nonassociated gas) minus US$16 (producing the oil and associated
gas in the future) or US$39.6 _-n 2015. Discounted to the present at a
discount rate of 10 percent, this value becomes US$2.27.
I.25.    The net benefit of producing the joint product today is US$11, which
exceeds the present value of the net cost of US$2.27. This simple methodology
can now be used to assess different examples. The method is a marginal
calculus and can therefore not be applied directly to an evaluation of a full
extraction strategy over time.
I.26.    If it is assumed that at the margin fields with a gas-oil ratio of 9
(in barrels of oil equivalent) are produced today - , that the gas is flared,
that the price of oil rise at 2 percent p.a. and the marginal cost of pro-
ducing the joint product is US$20, then the benefit for production today is
US$7. The cost in 2015 increases to US$49 (for imported oil) plus US$99 (for
producing ten "barrels" of nonassociated gas) minus US$20 (for producing the
joint product in 2015). The discounted cost is US$7. In this case, there is
no clear conclusion about whether oil should be imported or produced today.
But certainly, production should not be expanded, for example for export
purposes. This case represents a plausible scenario for marginal fields
produced in Argentina today.
1/ This figure is representative of several fields in the Austral basin.



- 72 -
I.27.    In addition, rising production costs can be taken into account as
well as a depletion value of nonassociated gas in the future. The simple
methodology shown above can in this way be used to obtain a better feeling for
critical values such as the gas-oil ratio, or increases in drilling costs, or
price increase in fuel oil, at which shutting down wells becomes
appropriate. The examples suggest that the present Government policy of (a)
exporting only limited amounts of oil, and (b) restricting flaring of gas by
administrative measures is a prudent policy to take maximum advantage of the
country's energy resources.
I.28     At the same time it is apparent that more detailed studies addressing
these issues need to be undertaken with the help of the existing model
prepared by Stone & Webster. Additional analysis, which would allow a better
estimate of the value of gas on the ground, would also be needed as the Stone
& Webster model does not derive the depletion value of gas but uses a residual
figure for the value of reserves remaining at the end of the planning
horizon. Such studies would have to be done on a field-by-field basis,
including potential future discoveries as regards oil and gas supply; and the
basis of detailed demand studies including future substitution options as
regards the demand for oil and gas. As many of these data would be uncertain,
probability calculus should be used.
Conclusion
I.29.    In this Annex a number of issues regarding gas utilization, oil and
gas field management, and gas pricing have been examined in Argentina.
Several cannot be known with certainty, such as the extent of potential oil
and gas reserves, substitution possibilities fer gas in the economy, and the
evolution of petroleum product border prices. Nevertheless, some results seem
fairly robust and several areas for further study can be identified. As
regards results it would seem reasonable to conclude that for the coming
years:
(a) Substantial quantities of gas would continue to be flared;
(b) The economic price of gas to the consumer should only comprise
the cost of transmission and distribution. (This becomes
particularly important when assessing the cost of hydropower
versus gas-fired plants in electricity generation);
(c) No major amounts of oil should be exported;
(d) At the margin higher-cost oil fields with low gas-oil ratios
(GOR's) should be developed instead of lower cost fields with
high GORs. A depletion value of US$0.10 - 0.20 per MCF is a
first approximation of the cost of flared gas.
(e) Gas substitution should continue to be agressively implemented.
(The aim would be to increase gas consumption by a higher
percentage than petroleum product consumption. This difference
should be at least equal to the expected percentage increase in
the GOR, as only such a policy could contain or reduce flaring of

1.30     In addition, several studies should be undertaken:
(a) A detailed evaluation of potentially recoverable reserves using
probability methods should be commissioned;
(b) The Gas Optimization Model should be used to determine the
outlines of a long-term reservoir management program and to
further assess gas utilization options, including in power
generation; and
(c) A study about the value of gas in the ground should be
commissioned in conjunction with the use of the gas model.
The Economic Value of Natural Gas in Argentina
User Cost
1.31     The existence of user cost or depletion value is directly related to
the physical limitation of resources. User cost includes the cost of not
having the resource available in the future and represents the additional
future cost of producing a marginal unit of gas today. In order to calculate
user cost, it is necessary to answer the question: "How and at what cost can
we the non-availability of natural gas in the future be offset"? To answer
this, the following variables must be defined. Figures in the right column
represent assumptions used in the case of Argentina.
Natural Gas Reserve                    : 2.5 x 1012 m3 (88.3 TSF)
Production Pattern                     :  1985 = 17.3 billion m
increasing 5.7%/yr thereafter.
Substitute Fuels at Depletion Point  : Fuel oil.
Price of Substitute Fuel               :  1985 = US$5MCF, increasing
2%/yr thereafter.
Additional Capital and Handling
Costs for Alternative Fuels          :  1985 = US$0.5/MCF, increasing
2%/yr thereafter.
Long-Run Narginal Supply Cost of
Natural Gas                          : Zero for cumulative
production of 1.8 x i012 m3;
then US$2/MCF.
Discount Rate                          :  10%
Price Elasticity of Demand             : 0.06X
Reserve-to-Production Ratio from
which Production Decline Begins    :  10
Rate of Production Decline             :  10%/yr
I.32     Based on the above data, a depletion value of US$0.12/MCF has
been evaluated.

Average Incremental Cost (AIC) of Natural Gas
Transmission Line
I.33     The AIC calculation is based on the construction of a new
pipeline system from the Neuquen fields to Buenos Aires via Bahia -
Blanca. The new pipeline has the following characteristics:
Length                                   : 1202 km (Loma de la Lata
- Buenos Aires)
Compressor stations                      : 2 compressors; 24,000 HP
each
Pipeline capacity                        : 18.2 -dM m3/day
Maximum capacity (with 4 compressors)  : 22.2 MM m3/day
Gas flow:
Loma de La Lata                        :  18.3 MM m3/day
General Cerri (in)                     :  18.2 MM m3/day
General Cerri (out)                    :  16.3 MM m3/day
Capital Costs:
Pipeline                               : US$550 Million
Compressors                            : US$150 Million
Other                                  : US$150 Million
Operating Cost
Compressor stations                    : 8% of investment
cost/year = US$12
million/yr.
Pipeline                               : 2% of investment
cost/year = US$11
million/yr.
1.34     These costs are increased by US$15 million for the gathering
system, after separation of natural gas from crude oil.
Distribution Network
1.35     Following the transmission of gas at a high pressure to the
main consumer center, natural gas must be further distributed, at a
lower pressure, through a distribution network to various end users.
The distribution line ensures the continuity of service to customers and
includes:
(a) Pressure regulators;
(b) Connection lines; and
(c) Distribution lines.
I.36     The costs of these components is estimated as follows:
(a) Pressure regulators: US$5-6 million
(b) Connection lines: Connection lines consist of pipes
connecting the main transmission line to industrial users,
power plants and residential users. For residential users,
this cost includes the main distribution lines.



- 75 -
The cost of connection lines is estimated at US$500 million
(US$460 for residential and commercial; US$40 for other
users).
(c) Distribution lines: Distribution lines consist of pipes of
small diameter, connecting the main distribution line to
various residential and commercial end users.
The cost of distribution lines is estimated at US$500
million.
I.37     Operating Costs are estimated at 4% of investment cost per
year, or: US$40 million/year.
AIC of Transmission and Distribution
I.38     Based on the above costs and the following parameters, an AIC
of US$1.25/MCF has been estimated for Argentina.
Total investment cost      =    US$1,820 million;
Operating cost             =    US$63 mill'on/yr;
Incremental volumes       =    17.25 MM m /day;
Discount rate              =    10%;
System life               =    20 years;
Transmission costs         =    US$0.55/MCF;
Distribution costs         =    US$0.70/MCF;

Annex II
Reserves and Production Potential
of the Northwestern Area of Argentina
Background
I1.1         The reserves and production potential of the Argentine
northwestern area gas-condensate fields have been studied by YPF. They have
also been assesed first by a Bank-financed individual consuLtant and then
confirmed by international consultants, Ryder Scott Engineering, working
within the framework of the oil and gas rationalization study carried out by
William Bros. on behalf of YPF.  In addition Cpo-Duran field has been
especially studied by rnlab S.A., an Argentinezi consulting firm, using a
compositional mathematical reservoir simulation model.
II.2         The northwestern Argentine area gas-condensate fields located in
the Salta province contain about 3.3 TCF of Eroven reserves or about 152 of
the country's total proven gas reserves. These fields contain in addition 1.6
TCF of gas reserves in the probable category. There are 7 fields: Aguarague,
Ramos, Campo-Duran, Kadrejones, Ipaguazy, !'cueta and Acambuco with the
following reserves and production data as of 01/01/85.

The table shows that 98% of the proven and probable reserves are from five
fields: Aguarague, Ramos, Campo Duran, Madrejones and Arambuco.
The Aguarague Field
11.3     Originally four gas structures (La Cuchara, Tranquitas, Arroyo
Lomitos and South Tranquitas) were discovered by YPF in 1978 at an average
reservoir depth of 4,200 meters. As additional wells were drilLed, these four
1/ Originally set up as a joint venture with the US firm Core Laboratories of
Dallas, Texas.



- 77 -
structures appeared to form a singLe large gas-condens ate field now called
Aguarague and covering a developed area of about 50 km . This field is
located 50 kms south of the Bolivian border and aoout 5-10 kms west of the
main gas trunk pipeline transporting gas to Buenos Aires.
II.4     Of 11 wells drilled as of January, 1985, nine have been are gas
producers, with an average gas and liquid production of respectively 140 HMCFD
and 4000 BD respectively. While at reservoir conditions the hydrocarbons are
in a gaseous phase, the liquids drop out of the gas phase when brought to
surface conditions in the low-termperature separation vessels. Natural gas
liquids (NGL) are then sent for further processing to recover condensate and
LPG. Condensate is processed further into gasoline, (naphta) and LPG in a
topping plant. Natural gas from Aguarague is sent directly to the main trunk
pipeline. YPF proposed to colLect this gas and process it further in the
Campo Duran plant before sending it into the main trunk pipeLine.
11.5     The results of a study carried out by Ryder Scott Engeering show that
with the drilling of seven additional wells and based only on proven reserves,
the Aguarague field could achieve a level of production of 350 MMCFD after
which production would decline at about 5.5% yearLy. However, only 65X of the
proven reserves would be produced after 20 years.  As a result, with
additional drilling the production of 350 MMCFD could be maintained constant
for about 8 years before declining at 7.5 percent per year thereafter. Since
it is not necessary to produce this field at such a high rate initially as a
result of the availability of gas from Bolivia, and since condensate recovery
could be improved with reinjection in this field, it is recommended that YPF
study the feasibility of producing this field at a high rate and reinjecting
gas not needed initially to meet market requirements.
The Ramos Field
Ir. 6    This field, operated under contract by Pluspetrol, a private
Argentine firm, is located 30 kms west of the main trunk pipeline west of
Aguarague.  In 1984 it produced about 50 MHCFD of gas and 1,540 BD of NGL from
six wells. Ryder Scott showed that, based on proven reserves of 0.9 TCF, full
development would require the drilling of 16 wells and expansion of gathering
surface separation facilities and transmission pipelines in order to achieve
about 175 HMCFD of peak rate production before declining at a rate of about 6
percent a year unless additional wells are drilled to maintain production.
Since YPF is contractually obligated to purchase only 140 MMCFD from Ramos,
this fieLd is definitely capable of meeting this requirement.
The Campo Duran
II.7     This gas condensate field was discovered by YPF in 1951 about 25 kms
south of the Bolivian border and 20 kms northeast of the Aguarague field along
the main trunk pipeline to Buenos Aires. Final development was completed in
1966 with 53 wells, of which 17 are now producing from a reservoir at 3,600
meters. Part of the gas was reinjected between 1958 and 1966 into four
wells. In August 1982 gas reinjection was resumed to store excess gas
produced in the area. As of January, 1985 proven reserves amounted to 0.2 TCF
including 0.1 TCF of gas that has thus far been reinjected into the reservoir.



- 78 -
II.8     The results of a study carried out by INLAB S.A. under contract to
YPF suggest that the future program for this field should consist of (i) a
reduction in the number of producing wells from 17 to 5 by 1986 but
maintaining gas production of 10 MICFD; and (ii) expansion of gas injection
from 35 MKFD in 1985 to 175 MNCFD into 18 injection wells. This program in
Campo Duran is timed to allow reinjection of excess gas that would c-.antually
be produced from Aguarague, Ramo and Acambuco but which could not be sent to
Buenos Aires due to seasonal decrease in demand.
I1.9     Campo Duran would serve not only as a storage for gas; reinjection of
gas would also actually permit a higher production of NGLs from producing
wells.
The Nadrejones Field
11.10    Madrejones field operated by YPF is located about 5 kms north of
Campo-Duran close to the Bolivian border. With 26 producing wells this field
has proven reserves of only 0.1 TCF and is quite depleted with a reservoir
pressure of only 10 kg/km . Ryder Scott have shown that this field could
deliver about 25 HMCFD if no gas is flared and production would decline at an
average rate of about 9.5 percent per year.  With proper facilities,
Madrejones could also be a good candidate for reinjection of gas.
The Acambuco and Other Smaller Fields
1I.11    Acambuco is a field operated under contract by Bridas, a private
Argentine company. The field is not developed yet. Ryder Scott estimates
that contribution by this field (35 MNCFD) along with other smaller fields
could reach 95 HMCFD and decline at about 19 percent per year thereafter.
Since YPF is contractually obligated to purchase 35 MMCFD from Acambuco, this
field is capable of meeting this requirement.
Availability of Gas Supply
II.12    The following table is based on the results of studies carried out by
Ryder Scott. It shows that the fields would not have any problem meeting the
gas supply requirements of expanded facilities for the Campo Duran processing
plant beyond the year 2000 even if the BoLivian contract is terminated in
1992.

field by this time.

V.2      Argentina has been receiving natural gas from Bolivia via a 24"
pipeline since 1972, prior to discovery of gas reserves in northern
Argentina.
V.3      The existing complex at Campo Duran receives gas from Bolivia at the
rate of 215 MMCFD with the pressure of about 650 PSI. The field of Campo
Duran produces small volumes of gas, about 10 KMCFD, at a low pressure of
about 370 PSI. The pressure of Campo Duran gas is boosted to 650 PSI by a
compressor and with gas from Bolivia, enter the existing Camp4j Duran liquid
extraction facilities at the rate of 225 MMCFD and 1,100 PS_.-_ The gas is
processed to extract its Liquid, producing 322 tons/day of propane,
.155 tons/day of butane and "pentane plus". Processed gas is injected into
Northern Pipeline Gas Transmission System at the race of 205 MMCFD. Extracted
liquids are sent to San Lorenzo by an existing 16'" multi-product pipeline.
1I The gas stream is recompressed from 650 PSI to 1,100 PSI before entering
the plant.

V.6       The proposed project would include:
(a)  Collection of additional volumes of gas from the fields of
Aguarague and Ramos and transportation of it to the Campo Duran
liquid extraction facilities, 60 kilometers north of these

low -emand months into the Campo Duran formation.
V.7      The additional volume of oil produced can be refined in the existing
Campo Duran refinery which has sufficient capacity to absorb the additional
oil flow
V.8      The new gas gathering pipelines are:
(a) 47 km of 30", 10.4 km of 24", and 8.08 km of 20" lines
representing the main gas header;
(b) a 38 km 14" pipeling connecting the Ramos Battery to the main
header;
(c)  8.3 km of 10" pipe connecting the Tranquitas Battery to the main
header; and
(d) 3 km of 10" and 8.9 km of 12" connecting the Arroyo Lomitas and
La Cuchara batteries in the Aguarague field to the main header.

(a) 28.5 km of 6", 42 km of 8" and 17 km of 4" lines representing
the main oil header from Ramos field to Plays Aguary, a town
south of Campo Duran complex.
V.10     The incrementaL increase in production of oil and gas requires
additional separator station, including associated control system and
instrumentation.
V.11     Gas enters the Campo Duran plant through an inlet separator where
some of the heavy liquids are knocked out and then enters the expander unit
where the pressure and temperature are reduced suddenly in order for
additional liquids to drop out from the stream. The liquid-free gas is then
injected into the main transmission line and the recovered liquids processed
through a deethanizer, depropanizer and debutanizer where, in each step,
ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline is recovered.

System. The capacity of this pipeline is exy7cted to increase from its
present capacity of 350 HMCFD to 475 MHCFD. _
V.13     As a result of seasonal gas demand variation in Buenos Aires, a
certain quantity of produced gas has to be reinjected into formation in order
to avoid flaring. Campo Duran is a suitable field for this purpose. This has
been demonstrated by a pilot reinjection plant which has been operating since
May 1982. However, with the additional volume of gas availabLe, a new
compressor station is required. The maximum capacity of this new unit should
be approximately 175 HMCFD and requires 18,000 horsepower. The minimum
capacity of the compressor required for the compressor is 35 MMCFD. This
volume would be reinjected during winter months when the gas demand is high.
Selection of Turbo Expansion Process in
Campo Duran Gas Liquid Recovery Project
V.14     There are several alternative technologies which may be used to
recover liquids from a natural gas stream. Recovery may be accomplished
through adsorption (the deposit of liquids on a solid component) absorption,
or renrigeration. The latter technology, which reduces temperatures to
promote condensation, includes (i) compression refregeration; (ii) absorption
refrigeration; (iii) expansion across value and (iv) expansion across the
turbine. The selection of the proper process depends upon temperature, and
pressure parameters and the composition of the natural gas.
V.15     The process selected for the proposed Campo Duran project is
expansion across a turbine through a turbo expander.
V.16     The process utilizes the high pressure of the naturaL gas stream to
drive a rotary expander wheel to extract energy from the flowing stream. The
removal of energy and the reduced pressure result in a large refrigeration
effect which condensates ethane, propane, butane and heavier hydrocarbons.
The recovered energy is transmitted directLy to a shaft which then drives a
gas compressor. This compressor increases the pressure of the gas after
recovery of the liquids.
V.17     Thus, the energy which is extracted from natural gas (through
reduction of pressure) in order to cause liquid condensation (recovery) is
returned to the natural gas stream by turbo expansion mechanism. This makes
it the most efficient process for liquid recovery when the gas is available at
alevated pressure.
l/  The pipelines minimum operating capacity is now 255 MMCFD and the maximum
operating capacity is 335 MMCFD with an average flow of 295 KMCFD. With
the expansion of the system, the pipeline minimum operation capacity will
be 350 MMCFD and the maximum will be 475 XMCFD, with an average flow of
415 IMHCFD.



- 87 -
V.18     The process produces a very high rate of recovery yielding 99.5Z of
"pentane-plus", 97-99% of butane, 90-95Z of propane and 60-80Z of ethane.
* V.19     As of mid-1984 there were approximately 325 plants of this type
operating in the maximum operating capacity is 335 MICFD with an average flow
of 295 MNCFD.  With the expansion of the syscem, the pipeline minimum
operation capacity will be 350 MICFD and the maximum will be 475 MMCFD, with
an average flow of 415 MMCFD. Within the past 10-15 years virtually alL major
liquid recovery from natural gas in the US has been accomplished by means of
the turbo expansion process. In Argentina there are three existing plants
(General Cerri, Loma de La Lata and existing Campo Duran), all of which have
been operated efficiently by YPF.
V.20     Given the very high efficiency of the process in terms of the rate of
Liquid recovery and the consumption, of energy, YPF's familiarity with the
process, and the relatively established technoLogy the turbo expander process
was selected for this project.

Annex VI
Selected Debottlenecking and Enhanced Recovery Subprojects
Loma de-la Lata/Sierra garrosa
Project Concept
VT.1     Natural gas froduced in the Loma de La Lata field in Neuquen province
is associated with oil. Produced gas, after being processed to recover
liquids, is dehydrated and transported to Buenos Aires by the "Centro-Oeste"
pipeline, one of the four major gas transmission trunklines in Argentina.
During summer months (January-March) when the demand for natural gas is Low,
the volume of gas in the transmission line is reduced significantly. When the
demand for gas declines, the production of oil, produced in association with
gas, is also reduced. In Argentina, decreases in the production of oil is
tantamount to importation of equal quantities of oil. In order to maintain a
steady maximum level in the production of oil from Sierra Barrosa and avoid
flaring of associated gas, it is proposed that gas available during the Low
demand season from Loma-de la Lata field into Sierra Barrosa, a gas field with
little or no production of oil.
Project Description
VI.2     The project consists of installation of compressor units with
sufficient capacity to compress excess gas from the Loma de La Lata fieLd, and
reinject it into the Sierra Barrose formation. The Centro-Oeste pipeline is
about 1,100 kilometer long and has a design capacity of 350 MMCFD. However,
the average annual flow rate for 1984 was about 300 MMCFD or 50 MMCFD less
than the line design capacity. The corresponding reduction in average
production amounts to some 1,100 barrels per day of oil. During the low
season (2-3 months) production lost is approximately 3,100-3,700 BPD.
VI.3     The installation -of compressor units would eLiminate this problem by
transferring gas available during sumer months, after being processed at Loma
de la Lata, to the Sierta Barrosa field, while the oil production continues on
uninterrupted basis. The Sierra Barrosa field is a suitable choice for
storage of gas since its operation is independent of oil production.
Purthermore, the reservoir pressure of this field is decliniag rapidly and the
reinjection of high pressure gas from Loma de La Latn would improve the life
of this reservoir.
VI. 4    Facilities required for the proposed project consist of gas
compressgy units with sufficient horsepower to raise the pressure of
70 HCFD_  from an initial pressure of 800 PSI to discharge pressure of about
11 (This is maximum design capacity; the actual flow rate varies from becween
30 - 50 MNCFD).



- 89 -
2,400 PSI for reinjection. It is proposed that two such units be installed;
one 9,000 HP, 70 MMCFD unit for 1986 to cope with present throughput and a
second identical unit for 1988 to cope with the projected expansion of the
Centro-Oeste" pipeline.
Cost Estimate
VI.5     Cost of the project for 9,000 H.P. to be installed in the first phase
is estimated to be US$7.93 million as follows:

Gas Gathering and Compression Project - Chubut Field
Project Concept
VI.6     In gas the fields in Chubut province near Comodoro Rivadavia, 18
MMCFD of total production of about 48 MMCFD of gas is presently being
flared.  About 12 MMCFD of this 18 MMCFD is flared due to lack of
infrastructure. YPF plans to collect this 12 MMCFD of flared gas, compress it
in a new compressor station, process it for separation of liquids and
dehydrate it to obtain pipeline quality gas. YPF estimates that 4.5 MMCFD of
gas will be consumed as fuel in various field facilities. The remaining 7.5
MMCFD will be recompressed for transportation and distribution in the central
area of Comodoro Rivadavia, where YPF's offices, workshops and power
generation faciLities are located. In such manner some of 7.5 MMCFD of gas
which otherwise would be flared will be utilized. Small quantities of
liquids will also be recovered from the flared gas.
Project Description
VI.7     The project consists of che installation of two compressor units:
(a)One 1,950 HP unit with flow capacity of 10-12 !IMCFD for
compressing gas from the fields of Escalante, C. Perdido, El
Trebol and Tordillo. Installation of this compressor unit will
permit the resumption of production from some wells which have
been shut-in, and production of approximately -100 BPD more
associated crude. The unit will also produce about 75 BPD of
natural gasoLine.

Condor-Cerro Redondo Complex
Project Concept
VI.9     Condor-Cerro Redondo is a gas dehydration and Liquid recovery complex
located 95 kilometers southwest of the city of Rio Callegos in Santa Cruz
province. The pipeline quality gas production of this compLex provides about
60Z of the gas transported by the Southern Gas Trunkline, the largest and
longest of the four major gas transmission lines in the country. The natural
gas supplied to the complex is produced from che two fields of "El Condor" and
'Cerro Redondo". The reservoir pressures in both of these fields have been
declining to the point that the inlet pressure to the gas processing plant is
about 75 PSI below the design pressure of the plait which is 1,030 PSI. Two
major difficulties have arisen as a resuLt of the pressure drop in the fields;
(a) the operation of the plant, has become suboptimal in terms of production
of liquids; (b) the production of oil has decreased as the producing wells
have to operate against the relatively high separator pressures, which are
held constant in order to meet the gas trea~ting plant inlet pressure
requirement. According to YPF, the quantity of oil and condensate which will
not be produced as the result of decLine in pressure, is about 440 BPD. YPF
therefore proposes installing two compressor units. One would increase the
inlet pressure to the gas plant in order for the plant to operate under design
pressure and thus optimize the production of liquids. This compressor would
also allow reduction in the operating pressure of the separators which, in
turn, resuLts in increasing the condensate production from individuaL wells.
The second compressor would boost the pressure of the dry gas stream from the
plant for supply to the Southern Pipeline System. Compressed gas from this
unit would also be available for use in "gas lift" operations to improve the
oil production from local fields.
Project Description
VI.10    The project consists of two compressor units installed in two phases;
in the first phase (1986), one compressor of design capacity 42 MMCFD 2,400

would be installed. The second compressor unit would be of design capacity of
35 MKCFD and 2,400 HP installed in 1988.

Gas Processing and Reinjection Project - Canadon Alfa
Project Concept
V.12     The Canadon Alfa field and its related facilities are located about
170 km north of the city of Rio Crande in Tierra Del Fuego. Existing
facilities, beLonging to both YPF and GdE, are used to recover gas liquids and
reinject part of the dry gas into the formation in order to avoid flaring.
Some gas is stilL flared, however, and some gas is transported to the pipeLine
without liquid recovery.. The volume of gas flared is about 50-60 MMCFD. YPF
proposes:
(a) To expand YPF's existing liquid recovery plant in the area
from 35 MMCFD to 50 MMCFD;
(b) To install a new gas liquid recovery plant with additional
capacity of 35 MMCFD; and
(c) To instalL a reinjection compressor in order to be able to
reinject excess gas into the formation when demand in the
Southern Pipeline System is low.
The volume of liquids extracted from the flared gas is about 220 BPD,
mainly natural gasoline.
Project Description
VI.13    The proposed project consists of the folLowing components:
(a)  Expansion of an existing "Low Temperature Separation
(LTS)" Unit from existing capacity of 35 MMCFD to 50 XMCFD
by modification to the glycol unit, the gas cooler and the
propane compressor units;
(b) Addition of a new LTS unit with a capacity of 35 XMCFD to
treat the portion of the gas which currently is



- 92 -
transported without recovery of its liquid to produce
natural gasoline and dry gas; and
(c)  Installation of a new reinjection compressor station of
about 3,800 HP in order to reinject about 35 MMCFD of gas
per day.

This field is very similar to Canadon Leon; iv has been water-
flooded, but the oil recovery is still low, making EOR
essential for increasing oil recovery.

This method for increasing oil recovery from relatively shallow
reservoirs containing viscous oil has been proved successful in
numerous fields throughout the world. Its application in
Arentina needs to be established.
Enhanced Oil Recovery Projects - Cost Estimate
VI.16    Assumptions employed in the preparation of the cost schedule are as
follows.
VI.17    For the first two years of the contract period, eight full-time
technical personnel will be required to reside in Buenos Aires and work
directly with the respective YPF technical personnel. Job descriptions are
generalized as:
l EOR Projects Supervisor
1 EOR Engineer
2 Reservoir Engineers w/EOR experience
l Production Geologist



- 96 -
1 Production - Equipment Engineer
2 Laboratory Technicians w/EOR experience
VI.18    Annual costs for this group are estimatedeto-be:
Salaries:                                US$505,000
Direct maintenance in Argentina             576,000
Estimated profit to contractor:             413,000
Contingencies:                              114,000
Total charge per year:                 US$1,600,000
VI.19    After the second year, the Production-Equipment engineer would not be
required, as a result of which the chargm for the third year is reduced to
approximately US$1,400,000.
VI.20    During the fourth and Last year of the contract period, only three
individuals will be required for evaluation of the ten EOR pilot's
performances to that time.
VI.21    The contract group wouLd need to dedicate approximately 75 percent of
its time to direct the studies and development of the EOR projects in Senal
Picada, Puesto Hernandez, La Sara, Puesto Guardian, and Barrancas fields as
follows:
(a) First year and first quarter second year -- basic field
study and all feasibility investigations complete with
pilot project defined;
(b)  By third quarter first year -  order all equipment
considered necessary to conduct pilot EOR projects;
(c) Second and third quarters second year -- drill wells,
conduct lab tests and revise data where required;
(d) By fourth quarter of second year -- initiate development
of pilot projects in each field; continue into third year
until development compLete; and
(e) Fourth year - monitoring results from pilot projects and
effecting changes as required.
VI.22         YPF would designate an EOR Projects Working Group comprised of
approximately 20 engineers, 10 geologists, 4 Laboratory technicians, 4
draftsmen, and various clerical personnel. About half of these YPF personnel
would work directly with the contract group on the five pilot EOR projects
identified above. The remaining half would prepare the basic field studies,
make feasibility determinations, and define the pilot projects in the Cerro
Bandera, Canadon Leon, El Destino, Canadon Perdido, and Zons Central fields,
with assistance and close cooperation from the contract group. This would
account for remaining 25 percent of the time of this group. As much
initiative as possible would be provided for to effect a true transfer of
technology from the contract group to the YPF group. The estimated cost on an
annual basis for the YPF group is US$1,467,000.



- 97 -
VI.23    The time limits estimated for the five projects to be directed by the
YPF group are:
(a) First year and first three quazrers of second year - complete
field studies, all feasibility determinations, and define the
pilot project in each of the five fields;
(b)  First quarter of second year -  order all equipment required for
the pilot EOR projects to be developed;
(c)  Fourth quarter of second year -  develop and initiate pilot
projects;
(d) Second half of third year - develop and initiate pilot
projects; and
(e) Fourth year - monitor pilot projects and modify as required.
Begin project evaluation.

Annex VII
Technical Assistance to YPF and the Government of Argentina
Technical Assistance to YPF
VII.1    The IBRD Refinery Conversion Project of October 1981 included US$1
million for the establishment of (1) cost centers; (2) a management
information system; and (3) medium-term capitaL budgeting and financial
planning at YPF. An additional US$l million was aLlocated for training of YPF
staff in financial management systems, energy saving and control techniques,
and maintenance practices.
VII.2    Because of the disruption associated with the South Atlantic crises
and successive changes in YPF senior management, these components under the
Refinery Conversion Loan have not yet been impLemented. Terms of reference
were issued, bids reviewed and a firm selected for the financial management
work, but with the agreement of the bidding firms involved, this work was
cancelled at the request of the new management which took over YPF with the
change of government at the beginning of last year. This management team
wished to review and expand the original terms of reference and integrate them
with the technical assistance work to be undertaken under the new loan.
VII.3    After detailed discussions with YPF and the Government of Argentina,
it has been agreed that the most effective means to implement a broad package
of technical assistance for YPF would be to combine the tasks defined under
the Refinery Conversion Project with those of the present project and execute
them in a single, coordinated manner. Accordingly, expenditures for services
incurred under the technical assistance component of the present project
relating to accounting, budgeting, financial control and management
information systems would be funded initially from the corresponding category
of the Refinery Conversion Project and subsequently from the present project.
VII.4    Emphasis on this component of the project is on introduction of
modern computerized control and information systems. Expert advisers will
assist in preparing terms of reference to assure that the work of systems
firms is adapted most effectively to YPF's existing systems and completly
integrated with them. Work will cover four areas in a coordinated manner:
(i)     Streamlining and automation of existing accounting systems,
with simplification where possible;
(ii)    Design of improved and semi-automated budget preparation
procedures;
(iii)   Improved financial control systems for specific areas
(inventory control, receivables, purchase orders etc); and
(iv)    An improved and more timely system for reporting of
information to management.

VII.5    The French company TOTAL (Compagnie Francaise de Petrol) has been
assisting YPF with certain technical aspects of the company's refinery
operations. TOTAL has submitted a contract proposal for technical assistance
in other of the company's operational areas. Terms of this contract have been
reviewed by the Bank. Costs are on a man-month basis and assistance provided
as requested. Services under this agreement may be included under support for
technical and commercial operation to YPF.
VII.6    Study of YPF's investment planning and programming would seek to
improve both the basis on which these plans are prepared as well as the
planning process itself. Work would build on information available from the
Stone and Webster research and the energy planning work of the Secretariat of
Energy. It-would seek to integrate YPF's short and medium-term planning of
investments with the country's total energy needs and with the long-term
energy development strategy elaborated by the Energy Secretariat. This work
would specifically focus on opportunities for increasing the extent to which
investment needs can be met from the private sector, domestic and foreign.
Among the terms of reference for such a study, to be submitted by YPF to the
Bank, would be a review of criteria for selection of new areas and terms for
offering such areas for exploration to the private sector.
VII.7    US$1,250,000 has been provided for training, including equipment
associated with the above components. These resources will supplement the
training provided under the Refinery Conversion Project (US$1 million).
Training funds may be utilized in conjunction with any of the specific
technical assistance components for training of YPF staff as agreed with the
Bank. It is anticipated the majority of the training funds will be allocated
to support training in enhanced oil recovery evaluation techniques and
implementation procedures and in computer training.
Technical Assistance to the Government of Argentina (Secretariat of Energy)
VII.8    The beneficiary of this component, costing US$2 million equivalent
including US$1.5 million in foreign exchange, will be both the Subsecretariat
of Planning and the Subsecretariat of Fuels in the Secretariat of Energy. The
PLanning Subsecretariat has as its main objective the preparation of a long-
range (to the year 2000) national plan for energy development. The Fuels
Secretariat is in charge of programming and executing a national fuels policy,
including pricing policies and the supervision of the yearly budget of YPF,
Gas del Estado, and Yacimientos Carboniferos Fiscales (YCF), with the
objective of ensuring the rational use, in the medium term, of the country's
resources in fuels. Both Subsecretariats are severely understaffed and lack
of resources to carry out their functions effectively.
VII.9    The Secretariat has expressed the need to the Bank for support in a
number of specific areas of study to supporc its programming and planning
work. These areas include study of the justification for a gas distribution
network in the northeast of the country; peak-showing in the power sector, and
export possibilities for methane. A list of specific studies to be funded
under this component would be drawn up during negotiations.



- 101 -
VII.10   In addition there is a continuing need:
(a)  To maintain and update the data bank, begun under Stone
and Webster project;
(b)  To analyze major investment projects in the sector;
(c)  To prepare development plans for, and review of annual
budgets of, the principal pubLic enterprises operating in
the sector, and analyze their coordination with private
sector activities;
(d)  To prepare an integrated modeL of Argentina's energy
sector with a view to improved a long-range energy
planning; and
(e)  Coordinate the policies of the Fuels and Planning
Subsecretariat with those relating to the Electricity
Subsecretariat.
VII.11   The Government of Argentina has agreed to submit a detailed work plan
for implementation of this component to the Bank by December 31, 1985.

Annex X
ARGENTINA
YPF - Projected Financial Statements 1985-1989
Financial Projections
X.1      A set of indicative financial projections for YPF have been prepared
for the period 191)-1989. The projections are expressed in current US dollar
equivalent terms.-   Projections are prepared in dollar-equivalent terms
because of the high levels of inflation in Argentina and inherent
uncertainties regarding the future value of the Argentine peso relative to
foreign currencies. The projections include disbursement of US$3.4 billion
equivalent to YPF by the Government of Argentina, in accordance with the terms
of the Government support commitment. This amount is assumed disbursed in
installments over a ten-year period with three year's grace, in accordance
with the terms recently being negotiated with the private banks. The
projections also include disbursement of the IBRD loan presently proposed.
X.2      A complete set of the financial projections prepared follows,
togeth ey with assumptions. An outline of these assumptions is footnoted
below.-
It  This methodology permits allowance for the real (net) cost of YPF
debt that is dollar-denominated and at fixed or essentially fixed
interest rates. Cumulative dollar inflation over the 1985-89 period
projected (based on standard Bank assumptions) is approximately 28%
and should be kept in mind in reviewing the figures shown.
2/  The projections incorporate the following methodology:
(a) Argentina's projected demand for crude and petroleum products
are estimated;
(b) An investment program is projected focused, as a result of
discussions with the Bank, on strictly essential areas given
the severe resource constraint. The investment program includes
completion of the IBRD Refinery Conversion Project. Private sector
production is assumed to increase at a rate pro-rata with overall
demand. Excess or shortfalls in crude or specific products are
assumed to be exported or imported, respectively, by YPF;
(c) Premium and regular gasoline prices in Argentina prevailing as
of December 1984 are maintained in constant dollar terms;
(d) Diesel prices and prices of other middle and heavy distillates are
increased two percent per month for eighteen months during 1985 and
1986, and maintained constant in real terms thereafter; fuel oil
prices are brought to the international level by 1987;
(e) Fuel excise taxes (the portion of retail sales prices retained
by the Government from retail product prices) declined to reach

X.3       Projected income statements and balance sheets for YPF are summarized
in Tables X.1 and X.2, following. The format follows YPF's own accounting
categories. Sales net of fuel taxes are shown as net domestic sales to YPF.
In the projections no net monetary or inflation adjustments are shown. Future
adjustments have been eliminated because the commitment by the Government of
Argentina to make the payments on much of YPF's foreign-denominated debt
largely eliminates the risk to YPF of monetary correction resulting from
differences between peso rates of inflation and peso devaluation. A new
policy by YPF to index its peso liabilities should reduce most remaining
adjustments on YPF's monetary amount. Inflation adjustments are assumed to
have neutral effect in the future.
X.4       The projections shown are, of necessity, indicative.  In the
financial and economic environment presently prevailing in Argentina, changes
in real demand, real prices, rates of inflation and exchange rates result in
more than the usual uncertainties regarding projections. Nevertheless, the
projections do indicate that if pricing and taxation policies along the lines
incorporated in the assumptions are implemented, and if the Government capital
support comitment is implemented, YPF may be expected to regain profitability
and financial self-sufficiency.

Notes:  Changes in Current and Long-Term Liabilities accounts from 1984 to 1995 reflect assumed
rescheduling of debt to long-term basis. Net Worth items shown above include Government capital
support coamitment which do not appear in Income Statement (Table X.1). Undisbursed Balance of
Government Comitment account includes accrued interest.
X.5        Projected sources and uses of funds are shown in Table X.3 (following
page). From Table X.3, it can be seen that YPF would generate cash flows (net
income plus depreciation and including disbursement of the Government support
commitment) increasing from approximately US$750 million in 1985 to US$1.7
billion in 1987 and US$2.6 bilLion by 1988. Total sources of funds would then
be adequate to support the company's proposed program of key investment
outlays as reviewed with the Bank with minimal dependence on new sources of
funds.
Detailed Assumptions Underlying the Financial Projections
X.6        The financial model is expressed in current US dollars.   Figures for
1984 have been estimated based on YPF financial statements as of September
1984.



- 108 -
X.7       Revenues are derived from forecasts prepared by YPF based on an
econometric model of sales of petroleum products to the retail market and to
private refineries and forecasts of sales of crude oil to private
refineries. These forecasts have been based on: overall economic growth;
predicted changes in the structure of the Argentine economy; substitution in
various sectors; YPF's, Gas del Estado's and private oil companies' respective
investment programs; and changes in the structure of YPF's refineries (notably
conversion of YPF refineries at La Plata and Lujan de Cuyo).

Note: Drawdown of Long-Term Borrowings and (negative) Increase in Current Liabilities
accounts during 1985 reflects assumed rescheduling of debt to long-term basis.
X.8       IBRD projections have been used for projected international crude oil
prices. The price at which crude oil is sold by YPF to private refineries is
increased in 1985 from US$11.20/barrel to the estimated cost of production
(US$16.00/barrel); prices then follow projected world crude prices.
X.9       Retail prices of super and regular gasoline are maintained constant
at present levels. For other petroleum products, the following assumptions
are made:
(a) Diesel oil: Two percent increase in real terms per month for
18 months beginning February 1985; retail prices
are then maintained constant in 1984 US$.
(b) Kerosene and gas oil: Same as (a) above.



- 109 -
(c)  Fuel oil:    The model assumes an increase of US$0.075/gallon
in 1985 and again in 1986 relative to present
retail fuel oil prices.
X.10     The relative structure of major petrolum product prices incorporated
in the model is summarized in Table X.4 below.
Table X.4
Assumed RAetait Petrolsum Product Price Structure
(as Percent of International Price: FOB Caribbean)
1984         1985         1989
(year-end)
Kerosene      77%           98%          119%
Diesel Oil    77%           99%          120%
Gas Oil       67%           80%          100%
Fuel Oil:     66%           77%           90%
1.11     The same price structure is assumed for bunker sales to the national
fleet. Oil product transactions between YPF and private refineries are
assumed at ex-refinery prices ("valor tanque"). Exports and imports of oil
products, as well as bunker sales to international purchasers, are assumed at
international prices (Caribbean market), adjusted by a coefficient for the CIF
and FOB values.
X.12     The model assumes that the prices of oil products in the
international market follow projected world crude price movements on a pro-
rata basis.
X.13     Non-Production Costs.  YPF bears two types of costs for domestic
crude oil purchased instead of produced:
(a)  Service payments to private contractors for crude
purchased. YPF' s own projections for these payments are
used in the model; and
(b)  Royalty payments to local provinces, which are formula-
based on international crude oil prices. In addition, YPF
pays additional taxes on general operations ("direct
taxes") and refining ("refinery taxes").
X.14     Fuel excise taxes ("Gravamanes Combustibles") are collected by YPF
for the central Government. For 1983 and 1984, prices remaining after fuel
taxes (and other minor discounts to retailers) are YPF's "retention" prices.
For 1983 and 1984, these are calculated as averages for the year. For 1985-89,
the model assumes fuel excise taxes at constant dollar levels equal to the 1985
level.
X.15     Inflation.  The US CDP deflator as projected by the Bank is used as
the basis for dollar inflation. ,



- 110 -
X.16     Disbursement of Covernment Comnitment.  1983 and 1984: actual.  For
the 1986-89 period, the model assumes that the Government will disburse each
year a total amount equivalent to YPF's projected payment of interest on
foreign debt plus principal payments on pre-1984 debt. 12 percent interest is
assumed to be aggregated to the undisbursed balance of the Covernment
com_itment.
X.17     Depreciation.  Depreciation is straight-line at various rates as
currently applied by YPF.
X.18     Foreign Debt.  Maturities are assumed over 10 years with 3 years'
grace. The model assumes an average interest rate of 12 percent simple
interest on future dollar payments.
