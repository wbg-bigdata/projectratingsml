F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from the Project Appraisal Document - PAD)

The overall goals of the proposed project were to reduce poverty, promote social stability and stimulate
economic development. The specific objectives of the project (the Project Development Objectives –
PDOs) were to improve land tenure security and promote the development of efficient land markets.
These objectives were to be achieved through: (a) the development of national policies, the regulatory
framework and institutions for land administration; (b) the issuance and registration of titles in urban and
rural areas; and (c) the establishment of an efficient and transparent land administration system.

The project was designed to be the first phase of the Government's Land Administration, Management
and Distribution Program (LAMDP), which was expected to be implemented over 15 years. The
objectives of the Program, as stated in the Land Policy Statement of the Royal Government of Cambodia
(May 2001), are: (a) to strengthen land tenure security and land markets, and to prevent and resolve land
disputes; (b) to manage land and natural resources in an equitable, sustainable and efficient manner; and
(c) to promote land distribution with equity.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

The objectives of the project remained unchanged throughout the implementation period.

                                               documents)
PDO Indicator 1: The amount of conflict over land falls.
Value                     undefined                undefined                     -                  not available
Date                     01/29/2002               12/31/2007                     -                   12/31/2009
                  In the absence of data, most of the results for indicators could not be quantified but, as described
                  in the “Comments? sections, qualitative results information can be substituted for the first two
                  PDO indicators and for the IO indicators.
                  This indicator is one of five key performance indicators (KPIs) that were stated for PDO #1 in
                  the Project Design Summary of the PAD. The base-line measure of the “extent of conflict? was
Comments          not defined. In the absence of agreed definitions and methodology, it is impossible to judge
                  whether there has been an “increase in the rate of resolution of disputes?. Evidence on this issue
                  is inconclusive. Beneficiary assessments provide a basis for the argument that disputes over land
                  eased following systematic titling. Reports based on media monitoring also suggest a decrease
                  in the number of new land disputes in recent years (see for example Statistical Analysis of Land
                  Disputes Occurring in Cambodia NGO Forum 2009). However, there are numerous reports of
                  land conflicts, including those that occur in areas adjudicated under the project, and recent
                  Government and non-governmental organization (NGO) publications cite concern that land
                  disputes may be increasing as plantation agriculture and urban development compete with
                  existing land use (see for example Supreme National Economic Council – 2007 - “The Report of
                  Land and Human Development in Cambodia?; Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee –
                  2009 - “Losing Ground?; http://sithi.org and www.ngoforum.org.kh.
PDO Indicator 2: The amount of “land grabbing? falls.
Value                    undefined                undefined                     -                  not available
Date                    01/29/2002               12/31/2007                     -                  12/31/2009
                  In the PAD, there is no definition (formal or otherwise) of “land grabbing?. A working definition
                  would be “forced evictions of people from their land, despite the rights granted to them under the
Comments          2001 Land Law, often by powerful individuals or groups and frequently supported by use of the
                  military or police forces.? In the absence of agreed definitions and methodology, it would be
                  impossible to judge whether there had been a “decrease in the amount of land-grabbing?. In any
                  case land acquisitions of dubious legality remain a problem, especially in the high-value areas
                  and where Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) are involved. ELCs are long-term leases of
                  “unused? land by the Government (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) to domestic

PDO Indicator 3: Agricultural productivity increases.

                  The base-line measure of productivity was not defined. In the absence of agreed definitions and
Comments          methodology, it is impossible to judge whether there has been an increase in agricultural
                  productivity attributable to the project.
PDO Indicator 4: Access to cheaper credit increases.
Value                    undefined                undefined                     -                  not available

Comments          No base-line measure was defined for “access to credit?. In the absence of agreed definitions and
                  methodology, it is impossible to judge whether there has been an improvement in access to
                  credit. There is evidence (see Annex 3) that the provision of title has had an effect on the cost of
                  credit.
PDO Indicator 5: Investment in the property sector increases.

                  Investment in the property sector grew at a high rate in the decade since the project‟s
Comments          identification. However, no base-line measure was given of the level of investment in a “without
                  project? scenario. In the absence of agreed definitions and methodology, it is impossible to judge
                  whether there has been an increase in investment attributable to the project.

Comments
                  This indicator is one of two KPIs provided for PDO #2 in the Project Design Summary of the
                  PAD. The first beneficiary assessment (BA1) showed a marked increase in land transactions
                  following systematic titling; 24 per cent of respondents reported that there had been an increase
                  in land transactions post-titling (compared to 8 per cent who reported a decrease and 68 per cent
                  who responded “no change? or “do not know?). The second beneficiary assessment (BA2 -
                  2009) similarly indicated an increasing number of transactions and until mid-2008 when the
                  global economic slow-down affected the market. The BAs offer no insight on the link between
                  land titling and increases in the number of land transactions.
PDO Indicator 7: The amount of taxes and fees collected from land transactions increases.
Value                    undefined               undefined                   -                  not available

                  BA2 cites revenue earned from the registration of land at US$60 million since 2003; the
Comments          proportion of this total that is attributable to the project cannot be determined.

Comments          Partially successful. A significant number of policy papers, declarations and frameworks has
                  been prepared, which are at different stages of review and approval by the Council on Land
                  Policy (CLP). Key policies and regulations on state land developed by the CLP include: (a) Sub-
                  decree on State Land Management (2005); (b) Sub-decree on Economic Land Concessions
                  (2005); and (c) Draft Spatial Planning Policy (2010). The Sub-decree on State Land
                  Management deals most directly with the delineation and administration of state land but has not
                  been implemented in a systematic way.

                  Successful. Both policy and the regulatory framework were approved after delay (June 2009)
                  although Development Partners active in the land sector expressed concern about the content of
Comments          these regulations in particular (a) inadequate protection for indigenous community land pending
                  registration; (b) potential problems with dispute resolution between individuals and communal
                  title holders and (c) prohibitions against owning private land while being a member of an
                  indigenous community. A „pipeline‟ of indigenous communities is preparing for titling; however,

Comments          The average time to delivery is steadily declining (now less than six months for most Land
                  Registration Teams - LRTs). There are some areas where the title delivery process continues to
                  take substantially longer and this leads to continuing concerns that the titling process is
                  illegitimately excluding some households from the titling process.

                  performance of the CCs conducted by the Bank and Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische
                  Zusammenarbeit (German Technical Cooperation – GTZ) noted broad compliance with the
                  required procedures – but also that its adjudication functions are largely inactive and that major
                  land disputes often by-pass the CCs in favor of executive agencies. While it is noted that over
                  17,000 disputes were successfully resolved by the Administrative Commissions as part of the
                  systematic titling process, it is also noted that disputes in systematic titling areas were not always
                  referred through the resolution process as anticipated in the project design.

                  Dealing in the ambiguities around the classification and use of state land provides significant
                  opportunities for corruption. The preparation of maps formalizing these boundaries in a
                  transparent, rules-based manner was beyond the capacity of the MLMUPC to facilitate.

                           Implementation Completion and Results Report


1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Cambodia is a predominantly agrarian country. Despite having one of the highest levels of
natural resource endowment per capita in Southeast Asia, it also has one of the highest poverty rates in
the region. In the late 1990s, more than 50 per cent of Gross Domestic Product came from the
agricultural sector, almost 80 per cent of the total population was rural, and rural households accounted
for almost 90 per cent of Cambodia‟s poor. Today, more than 70 percent of the people remain rural
dwellers and more than 60 percent of agricultural output is absorbed by subsistence consumption. The
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) then in effect (covering FYs 2000-2003) highlighted the lack of
access to land as a major contributing factor to rural poverty and low income-earning potential.

1.1.2 The history of land rights in Cambodia is complex. In the pre-colonial era, all land was owned by
the sovereign but households held transferable rights in land under cultivation. During the French
colonial period, from 1864-1953, a system of formal property rights was introduced but the registration of
ownership extended only to the towns and some areas of high-productivity agricultural land. After
independence, the French system was retained but little progress was made in extending its reach. By
1975, it is estimated that only about ten percent of plots were fully registered (ref. “Land Regime in
Cambodia? Voan Lim, unpublished manuscript, 1997, cited in So, forthcoming, “The Politics and
Practice of Land Registration at the Grass Roots Level in Cambodia?). During the catastrophe of Khmer
Rouge rule (1975-1979), under which an estimated 1.5 million people died, the land was collectivized and
records, including cadastral maps and land titles, were systematically and deliberately destroyed.

1.1.3 After the Khmer Rouge regime was deposed, people returned to farming in the framework of a
physically and socially wrecked country. A new system of collective farming was implemented to
varying degrees in different parts of the country. The population occupied land (which, by default, was
considered to be State-owned) through an informal system of land-holding that depended on the
recognition of occupancy rights from neighbors and local authorities.

1.1.4 The conventional wisdom holds that the massive social upheavals during the Khmer Rouge
regime and decades of armed conflict had the effect of severely weakening traditional customs regulating
the use of land, and the modern institutions for land administration and resolution of disputes remained
extremely weak. The private possession of agricultural land was restored in 1989, and after the enactment
of the Land Law in October 1992 a program was initiated for landholders to apply for certificates that
would confirm possession rights. More than four million applications were received but by mid-2001
only 15 per cent of them had been processed because of limited institutional capacity and the costs (both
legitimate and in bribes) associated with the sporadic titling process. This is the narrative of “the great
disruption?, which is one of the foundations for the argument for a nation-wide titling program. There is a
compelling counter-argument that holds that adaptations of the traditional systems have, in fact, been
highly durable. To this day, most people hold transferable possessory rights over land on the basis of
recognition by neighbours and local authorities. This is similar to the situation under the French in the
early 20th century. As described below, when modern titles are issued the system tends to default back to
the traditional system through the non-registration of 90 per cent of subsequent transactions.

                                                    1
1.1.5 The main objective of the Bank‟s CAS then in effect was to assist Cambodia to “… build the
foundations for sustainable development and poverty reduction for the medium to long term.? The
project was intended to “… contribute to two of the three foundations identified in the CAS: (a) good
governance, including an efficient and accountable public administration and a credible legal and
judicial framework that safeguards basic human and property rights; and (b) greater access for the poor
to basic social services and economic opportunities.?. The third “foundation? was “a policy environment
that encourages private investment and entrepreneurship?. In fact, the CAS had four “pillars?: (a)
supporting good governance; (b) building physical infrastructure; (c) rebuilding human and social capital
through health and education investments; and (d) facilitating private sector development.

1.1.6 The rationale for the Bank‟s involvement in the Land Administration and Management Project
(hereinafter “the project? or “LMAP?) was based on three concepts: (a) having supported many land
management and administration projects throughout the world, including four in the East Asia and Pacific
Region, the Bank had accumulated considerable expertise in integrating the policy, institutional and
technical aspects required to improve the security of land tenure; (b) the Bank was felt to have developed
a good working relationship with the Government, making it possible “… to maintain the dialogue
needed to resolve the difficult issues that inevitably will arise during implementation of the project.?; and
(c) the Bank had developed effective relationships with other donors in Cambodia working on land and
closely-related issues, making it likely that Bank involvement would “… bring coherence to the donors’
program supporting land issues in Cambodia..?.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Performance Indicators

1.2.1 The project was the first phase of the Government's LAMDP, which at the time of appraisal was
expected to be implemented over 15 years. The goals of the Program, as stated in the Land Policy
Statement of the Government in May 2001, are: (a) to strengthen land tenure security and land markets
(and thereby prevent and resolve land disputes); (b) to manage land and natural resources in an equitable,
sustainable and efficient manner; and (c) to promote land distribution with equity.

1.2.2 The PDOs were to improve land tenure security and to promote the development of efficient land
markets; these correspond to goal (a) of the LAMDP. These objectives were to be achieved through: (a)
the development of national policies, the regulatory framework, and institutions for land administration;
(b) the issuance and registration of titles in urban and rural areas; and (c) the establishment of an efficient
and transparent land administration system. Unusually, the project was also described as having the
“overall goals? of reducing poverty, promoting social stability and stimulating economic development;
these “overall goals? are markedly different both from the goals of the LAMDP and from the “Sector-
related CAS Goal? shown in the Project Design Summary (PAD Annex 1).
1
  In the DCA, the objectives of the project are presented in a completely different manner: “The objectives
of the Project are to assist the Borrower in its efforts to implement the (LAMD) Program.?. It is unusual
to see such a wide discrepancy between the PAD and the legal agreement in the specification of a
project‟s objectives, and it is not clear why such a discrepancy was allowed to occur and persist. The
formulation of the objective(s) in the DCA is vague and unhelpful: taken literally, it would be almost
impossible to fail to meet this objective, since anything the project did to assist the Borrower in
implementing the LAMDP would imply that the objective had been met.

                PDOs                                                    KPIs
 1. To improve land tenure          1. A reduction in conflict over land.
 security (for urban and            2. A reduction in “land grabbing?.
 agricultural land-holders).        3. An increase in agricultural productivity.
                                    4. An increase in access to (cheaper) credit.
                                    5. An increase in investment in the property sector.
 2. To promote the development of   1. An increase in the number of land transactions.
 efficient land markets.            2. An increase in the taxes and fees collected from land transactions.


1.3    Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority) and
Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

1.3.1   There were no revisions made to the PDOs or to the KPIs during the life of the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The PAD stated that the range of benefits to be generated from secure land rights (social stability,
poverty reduction and economic growth), improved land administration (efficient land markets and better
land use) and improved capacity for land management (improved environmental management) would
improve the lives of the whole population of Cambodia. More specifically, about one million households
in both rural and urban areas were expected to receive land titles under the project with the concomitant
benefits of increased security of tenure, access to credit and increased incentive to invest and to raise
productivity. Many of the beneficiaries were expected to be poor and vulnerable to being dislodged from
their land; secure titles were expected to reduce the risks of dispossession through “land-grabbing?.

1.4.2 The causal link between the project investments and the benefits expected to flow to the
beneficiaries was clear. The project aimed to achieve a comprehensive reform of land management in
Cambodia, and “… to assist the Government to develop policies and regulations; to strengthen the
capacity of the MLMUPC and its provincial and district offices to administer land; to establish systematic
and sporadic land titling programs to issue about one million titles; to increase the capacity to resolve
disputes; and to develop the information base needed to improve land management.?. The existence of
one million landholders with titles (out of a then-estimated 6-7 million land parcels in the whole country)
was expected to provide a “critical mass? of landholders among whom the benefits of improved land
tenure security would be self-evident, paving the way for the continued implementation of the LAMDP
focused on the eventual titling of the whole country.

1.5 Original Components

1.5.1 The project, initially designed to be implemented in ten provinces and one municipality, had five
components and eighteen sub-components. The costs estimated at appraisal included both physical and
price contingency provisions. The Project Area was later expanded to 14 provinces.

1.5.2 Component 1: The Development of Land Policy and Regulatory Framework (US$2.80
million, 8.3 per cent of total project costs, of which IDA would finance US$1.80 million). The
component contained four sub-components: (a) the development of the capacity of the Secretariat of the
Council of Land Policy; (b) the formulation of key policies for land administration and management; (c)
the development and drafting of legal instruments; and (d) the dissemination of policies, laws, rules and
regulations. The intended causal link between the component and the PDO outcome was an indirect one.

                                                       3
The establishment of the policy and regulatory framework was considered to be a necessary (though far
from sufficient) condition for the achievement of land tenure security and efficient land markets.

1.5.3 Component 2: Institutional Development (US$6.40 million, 18.9 per cent of total project costs,
of which IDA would finance US$3.70 million). The component contained four sub-components: (a) the
long-term institutional development of the MLMUPC at all levels; (b) project management; (c) the
development of a land management and administration education program; and (d) the development of a
private land surveying industry. The intended causal link between the component and the PDO outcome
was an indirect one. Institutional development was considered to be essential for the implementation of
the policy and regulatory framework and the administrative systems of land administration.

1.5.4 Component 3: A Land Titling Program and Development of a Land Registration System
(US$20.40 million, 60.2 per cent of total project costs, of which IDA would finance US$16.70 million).
The component contained four sub-components: (a) information dissemination and community
participation; (b) a systematic land titling program; (c) a sporadic land titling program; and (d) the
development of a modern land registration system. The intended causal link between the component and
the PDO outcome was a direct one. Land titling and land registration would provide a necessary but not
sufficient condition for those receiving land titles to benefit from improved security of tenure and to
participate in emerging efficient land markets. Enabling conditions to benefit fully from land titles would
include reliable land valuation and transparent land taxation (see also Annex 3; pg 61).

1.5.5 Component 4: The Strengthening of Mechanisms for Dispute Resolution (US$1.70 million,
5.0 per cent of total project costs, of which IDA would finance US$1.00 million). The component had
three sub-components: (a) the strengthening of the National Cadastral Commission; (b) the strengthening
of the provincial Cadastral Commissions; and (c) legal assistance for the disadvantaged. The intended
causal link between the component and the PDO outcome of improved tenure security was a direct one.
The establishment of effective mechanisms for resolving disputes (a particularly weak part of land
administration at the beginning of the project) was a necessary condition for the achievement of an overall
improvement in tenure security.

1.5.6 Component 5: Land Management (US$2.60 million, 7.7 per cent of the total project costs, of
which IDA US$1.1 million). The component had three broad areas of activity: (a) the clarification of
procedures for land classification; (b) the procurement of aerial photography and satellite imagery; and (c)
the preparation of land classification maps at the provincial level. The intended causal link between the
component and the PDO outcome was an indirect one; key land tenure issues are directly related to the
classification of state-owned land. These are not presented as sub-components in the PAD (where very
little information was provided on the component) but are described as such in this ICR to be consistent
with the other components.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1 No formal revision was made of any of the project‟s components. However, Component 5 seems
to have mutated several times over the life of the project and was only partially implemented. The
component was a late addition to the project‟s structure and there is little supporting description in the
PAD. It was introduced into the project to prepare land classification maps at the provincial level,
including the clarification of technical procedures and the acquisition of aerial photographs and satellite
imagery.

1.6.2 During the Mid-term Review (MTR), the weak progress being made under Component 5 was
identified and it was agreed to restructure it. A new structure of the component was proposed by the


                                                     4
Government and modified by the Bank‟s Task Team. Although agreed to in principle, it was not formally
adopted (via an amendment to the DCA) because after the MTR the Government and Donors modified
their approach to the land sector to adopt a program-based approach and the proposed changes lost
relevance.

1.6.3 However, project reporting post-MTR on this component was based on the “revised? structure.
The newly-defined component included the mapping of state land holdings and the provision of support
to spatial planning and the NSDI, as well as commune boundary definition. In June 2007, it was noted
that five pilot sites were in progress but that “… the project would not achieve the targets?. In June 2008,
the component was described as lagging and it was stated that the Land Management Sub-sector Program
(LMSSP) must be developed and agreed as the basis for moving forward. By April 2009, it was
suggested that the component should be dropped altogether, and that in practice spatial planning was
being supported under Component 1 and state land mapping under Component 3. Finally, in March 2010
it was stated that the legal and regulatory framework had been developed, but that the preparation of the
maps “… requires inter-ministerial coordination and the finalization and endorsement of the LMSSP.?
The shortcoming in the implementation of this component had important consequences in the later stages
of the project‟s life.

1.6.4 In December 2006, as part of the set of actions agreed to in order to lift the suspension of
disbursement, the Government prepared an Action Plan for the review of the design of the project and
received the Bank‟s “no objection?. This theoretically committed the Government to the restructuring of
the project, but the Action Plan appears not to have been implemented. There was no follow-up from the
Bank, and the review of the design of the project does not appear in the supervision record as a “Key
Issue and Action?.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1   There were no changes in the design of the project or in the implementation arrangements.

1.7.2 Following a Fiduciary Review of the Bank‟s portfolio in Cambodia, further investigation by INT
uncovered evidence of corrupt, collusive and fraudulent practices in seven Bank-assisted projects
including the LMAP. The Bank declared mis-procurement on 17 civil works contracts under the project,
and suspended disbursements from the Credit on June 6, 2006; a portion of the Credit was cancelled and a
refund was made by the Borrower. In addition, the Bank identified serious fiduciary concerns related to
performance-based field allowances (PBFAs) and delays in the implementation of good governance
measures. The project‟s Internal Auditor also identified serious issues regarding additional payments and
the misuse of vehicles and equipment. The MLMUPC subsequently met the requirements of the Bank for
the lifting of the suspension, which took place on February 5, 2007.

1.7.3 At the end of 2007, the Closing Date of the Credit was extended by two years and the scale of the
project was expanded from the originally-defined ten provinces and one municipality to include three
additional provinces (utilizing a grant from CIDA, which had joined the project through TFs in 2004 with
the provision of technical assistance - TA).

1.7.4 A major disagreement occurred in 2009 between the Bank and the Government concerning the
latter‟s handling of resettlement of families living in the Boeung Kak Lake (BKL) area in Phnom Penh.
This became the subject of a complaint to the Bank‟s Inspection Panel in September 2009 (see Section
2.4).Upon the unilateral decision of the Government, the Bank was requested on September 7, 2009, to
cancel the undisbursed balance of the Credit. The balance of the Credit was actually cancelled on
September 20, 2010 following the receipt of full documentation for the Designated Account. At the time

                                                     5
of the cancellation, SDR13.36 million (approximately 69 per cent of the Credit - US$19.9 million
equivalent) had been disbursed. The remaining trust fund agreements were also cancelled via cross-
default clauses. The Credit closed on December 31, 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Note: A chronology is shown in Annex 10 that illustrates the key steps involved in identification,
preparation, appraisal and implementation.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Sound Situation Analysis: The background analysis supporting the project was good. A clear
description of the then-current situation was provided in the PAD, which included estimates of land use
and descriptions of the forms of land tenure, the system of administration of property rights, the status of
titles and land tenure certificates of possessory rights, state-owned land and land conflicts. The
conclusions of the analysis were that: (a) the lack of security in land tenure and landlessness were major
causes of poverty; (b) the lack of information on state-owned land fostered a lack of transparency and
provided opportunities for illicit enrichment by well-placed officials; (c) conflicts over land were
becoming ever more serious, with the poor and illiterate suffering the loss of their land and a steady
consolidation of land in the hands of wealthier and powerful people, problems exacerbated by the poorly-
functioning dispute resolution mechanisms; (d) incentives to invest in productivity-enhancing measures
were reduced by the lack of clear title; and (e) a widespread destruction of natural resources was in
progress, driven by a mentality of short-term gains in an uncertain and ill-informed environment without a
long-term strategy or coherent policy framework.

2.1.2 The project concept emerged from a workshop on land issues hosted by the new MLMUPC in
July 2000. Two Japan Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grants were approved and
signed in January 2001 to support project preparation and design; a recipient-executed grant of
US$347,929 was managed by the MLMUC, and the Bank executed a grant of US$248,446. A project
preparation team was established by MLMUPC.

2.1.3 Pilot Projects. The design of the LMAP was influenced by two pilot projects, the Land
Management Pilot Project led by GTZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit ; German
Technical Cooperation) that commenced in 1995 and the Cambodian Cadastral Project led by FINNMAP
that commenced in 1997. As the LMAP evolved into a multi-donor supported project, these two pilot
projects were merged into it, providing a wealth of practical information and experience to inform both
the design and implementation of the LMAP.

2.1.4 In 2001, three multi-donor missions (including representatives of IDA and the Governments of
Finland and Germany) reviewed the work of the preparation team and the consultants. A “pre-
implementation? phase from October 2001 to June 2002 prepared the operational structure for the LMAP
supported by TA as the two pilot projects continued and merged into the LMAP.

2.1.5 Assessment of Project Design: The PDOs of the project were vague and qualitative; to improve
the security of land tenure and the efficiency of land markets were objectives that required the
simultaneous satisfaction of a large number of conditions besides those that were affected by the project.
This is perfectly clear in the “critical assumptions? of the PAD Project Design Summary. With the
benefit of hind-sight, it might have been helpful to align the objectives with the outputs of the project –
i.e., to have made the objectives of the project the creation of a functioning lands administration system
and the production and distribution of titles. The KPIs as defined were similarly abstract and difficult to

                                                     6
measure. Their effective measurement would have required a detailed base-line study and the collection
of panel data over the life of the project, and would have been affected by the issue of attribution. In
practice, the base-line study was carried out significantly after the commencement of implementation and
the impact assessment was never done.

2.1.6 The components were defined as a function of the “irreducible complexity? of the project: the
overall “environment? (the strategy, policy, legal framework and administrative procedures), the
institutions, the title production, registration and delivery mechanisms, and the dispute resolution
mechanism were all considered to be necessary activities, the “moving parts? of a complex machine.
They all had to function (and many other factors had to become aligned) if the project was to achieve its
objectives. As a result, the project was complex, but it was not unnecessarily so.

2.1.7 Concept and Design Limitations: The project design under-estimated the complexity and
politically-fraught nature of State land management, and failed to address directly and seek to overcome
the commonplace corruption throughout the system. The lack of a detailed plan for inter-ministerial and
inter-agency coordination was a serious short-coming, especially given the multi-faceted nature of the
land management agenda as well as its political and technical complexity. As described above (paragraph
1.1.4), it can be argued that the description of the “chaos? that existed in land management and the
administration of formal titles underplayed the importance of continuing systems that had proven
remarkably durable.

2.1.8 After twenty-five years of conflict, in 2000 the land sector in Cambodia was considered to be one
of the most challenging in the world. Most records and even the systems of land administration had been
deliberately destroyed during the Khmer Rouge regime, there were numerous disputes over land and there
was little capacity in the administration with which to commence rebuilding. It was recognized at the
time that the project was a risky undertaking in a sector bedeviled by corruption; however, it was also an
essential undertaking if Cambodia was to establish the administrative infrastructure of land management
that would provide the essential bedrock foundation for future economic development.

 2.1.9 As the history of project design and implementation unfolds in this ICR, it is essential to bear in
mind that the importance of the goal justified the risks being undertaken and that, whatever imperfections
and problems may have occurred during implementation, the Bank might well have been considered to
have failed in its duty had it not supported the project in the context of the overall LAMDP. It was,
perhaps, uniquely placed to bring multiple parties together in pursuit of a highly laudable goal, and had
reason to believe that it would be able to use its powers of persuasion to resolve implementation issues,
particularly those concerning governance, as they arose.

2.1.10 Adequacy of the Government’s Commitment: The Government recognized in the late 1980‟s
the need to address land issues. Following the passage of the 1992 Land Law, it requested donor support
for issuing land titles and from 1999 it moved to establish the MLMUPC and the CLP, to publish a
“Statement on Land Policy? and to prepare the improved Land Law of 2001. At appraisal, the
Government was stated as viewing the project as an important instrument to support the implementation
of its policies comprehensively laid out in the Statement on Land Policy.

2.1.11 However, the PAD made it clear that not only were there risks involved in the project but that
evidence was there for all to see that a general statement of commitment by the Government was not at all
the same thing as a whole-hearted endorsement of the implications of the project by all of the stake-
holders:
“… the allocation of forestry and fishing concessions seems to be undertaken at provincial level or by
politicians at all levels.? (page 4, paragraph 2)

                                                    7
 “… state private land … can be sold and is reported to be frequently sold by ministries and state
agencies in an ad hoc manner, with the proceeds not returning to the Treasury for public benefit.?
(page 4, paragraph 4)
“There are suggestions that state agents such as the military and politically connected people have
dispossessed people of their land, which is being facilitated by the lack of formal recognition of rights on
those lands.? (page 5, paragraph 1)
“Conflicts over land are growing, increasingly involving people or entities from outside the community
seeking land for commercial purposes. As a result, land is becoming progressively more concentrated in
the hands of influential and powerful people or entities and those who can afford informal payments,
especially in regions with potential for tourism, logging, industrial or urban development.? (page 5,
paragraph 2)
“However, in a weak governance system, actual implementation of these policies will rely heavily on the
commitment and capacity of the government to implement these reform areas, yet to be seen during
project implementation.? (page 7, paragraph 1)
The PAD highlighted the free-wheeling and corrupt attitude of government agencies towards equitable
land rights exercised through the rule of law. It may be that the Government‟s “commitment? was a
necessary but not sufficient condition for the project to prosper. There were and remain powerful vested
interests for which a well-functioning system of land administration and an efficient use of natural
resources for the benefit of the population as a whole represent serious obstacles to private gain and, as a
result, certain economic and political agents have not acted in a manner consistent with the “public good?
nature of the project. It is also acknowledged, as explained in the Borrowers Completion Report (BCR),
that commitment to the land reform agenda from government agencies outside MLMUPC was variable.
The CLP, while moving forward with an impressive policy and regulatory agenda, did not have the
political leverage to maintain a coherent pro-reform position on key issues. In practice then the project
operated largely as an instrument of the MLMUPC and consistently fell short in areas where the design
required ongoing inter-agency collaboration (e.g., transparently identifying and reporting on land conflicts
in adjudication areas, promptly assessing and providing compensation for resettlement, defining state land
boundaries, assessing land values and associated taxes).

2.1.12 Assessment of Risks: The project was considered to be a risky undertaking at appraisal; it was
understood in advance to be complex and ambitious because it sought to deal simultaneously with
multiple issues in land management and administration in a fragile policy and administrative environment.
The unavoidable complexity of the project and the backdrop of political and administrative inefficiency
(ranging from a lack of competence through to corruption) necessarily meant that the project was a risky
undertaking. The PAD Critical Risks assessment (Section F, paragraph 2) rated the overall project risk as
“substantial?. The Procurement and Financial Management Issues discussion (Section E, paragraphs 4.3.
and 4.4) concluded that both of these risks were “high?.

2.1.13 Twelve risks were identified in the PAD as “critical? and it is evident that several of them did
indeed materialize during project implementation. The description of the mitigating measures proposed at
appraisal is far from convincing, and the analysis, in effect, identified some risks and areas of uncertainty
for which there were no realistic countervailing measures available. Dialogue, consultation, TA and
project “support? were the proposed mitigation measures but, with the benefit of hindsight, these appear
to have been of little value in overcoming the serious obstacles placed in the way of project
implementation. In the case of two of the risks (#8 - concerning institutional reform - and #11-
concerning dispute resolution mechanisms), part of the mitigation measure proposed was to “scale-back?
the project if commitment on the part of the Government was considered to be inadequate, although it is
difficult to see quite what purpose would be solved by such “scaling-back?, since the problem would
simply be made smaller but not resolved by such action (see also Annex 11).

                                                     8
2.1.14 Similarly, the PAD suggested that the risk of not reaching agreement on the process of land
classification could be overcome by supporting a “… consultation process to build broad consensus for
decisions …? and “… technical assistance to the CLP to reach consensus among the various government
agencies.?. A more detailed analysis and open assessment of the political economy context might well
have identified this view as overly optimistic, and that: (a) success in this respect depended on high-level
inter-agency coordination; (b) consultation would not necessarily lead to consensus; and (c) numerous
actors had (and still have) strong incentives not to proceed with a transparent and public interest-based
classification and registration of State land.

2.1.15 Resettlement under the Project: The PAD stated that no eviction, involuntary resettlement or
land acquisition was anticipated under the project. Nevertheless, the DCA provided that it would be
implemented in accordance with Environmental and Social Guidelines (ESG) including a Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) that would be triggered in the case of “evictions from state land (…) under
Parts C (b) and (c) of the Project? (those relating to systematic and sporadic titling).

2.1.16 The RPF provided that it would apply to people negatively impacted from three possible sources.
These were: (a) the eviction from State land of individuals who had occupied it prior to August 30, 2001,
the date of the enactment of the 2001 Land Law, following titling of such land in the name of the State ;
(b) the eviction from State land titled in the name of the State of individuals who had occupied it prior to
August 30, 2001, because of the need to use such land for the carrying out of civil works under the
project; and (c) the extension by the State of Right of Way (ROW) claims that adversely affected
possession rights. More broadly, the RPF was intended to ensure that people who “may be negatively
affected by the Project will be assisted to improve, or at least restore their living standards, income
and/or production capacity to pre-project levels.?

2.1.17 As originally drafted, the RPF focused only on potential displacement associated with civil works
and ROW extension. It was only shortly before the Safeguards Meeting in September 2001 that reference
to evictions from State land following titling was added. The addition of this language reflected evolving
thinking within the Bank at that time as advanced drafts of what is now OP 4.12 were being discussed.
Up to that time, land titling was not explicitly considered in Bank policy or practice as an activity that
might result in or contribute to involuntary resettlement. By contrast, in discussions surrounding the
drafting of OP 4.12, the potential for displacement associated with land titling was addressed. A decision
was made to distinguish between the effects of conflicting claims of private parties over private land, to
which the policy would not apply, and conflicts involving claims from private parties residing on State
land, in which case the policy would apply. The LMAP RPF was the first such Bank document to reflect
this approach. As discussed in section 2.4 below, the interpretation of the RPF became (and continues to
be) a major point of contention between the Bank and the RGC.

2.1.18 A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) carried out by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in
June 2002 gave the project a “satisfactory? rating. The findings and conclusions are discussed in Section
5.1 on the Bank‟s performance.

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1 The backlog in the delivery of titles has been an issue from the very beginning of the project (it
was raised even before the Credit became effective); as late as the MTR, it was reported that some titles
(5,000 of the total of 81,000) prepared under the preceding pilot projects had still not been distributed.

2.2.2 The Mid-Term Review was carried out in October 2004, a little over two years after the
effectiveness of the Credit. Overall implementation progress was considered “satisfactory? although the
project was experiencing a slow build-up based on the earlier pilot projects and emphasizing: (a) the

                                                     9
creation of the regulatory framework, based on the 2001 Land Law, to enable land registration activities;
(b) dealing with the back-log of undelivered titles from the pilot project era; (c) developing policies,
procedures and systems; and (d) training and capacity building. Preparing the “enabling environment?
took precedence over other activities (e.g., plot demarcation and titling) that were implemented more
slowly than had been anticipated, and many of the delays were attributed in part to the delay in forming a
new Government after the elections of July 2003.

2.2.3     The detailed and comprehensive Project Supervision Report - PSR - (Sequence #8 of November
30, 2004) that followed the MTR described a number of issues and actions that, though important, were
“run of the mill? implementation tasks and nothing that would have required restructuring (even with the
benefit of hindsight) . Although changing Component 5 is discussed in the Aide Memoire of the MTR
mission, it is not included in the Management Letter follow-up or in the PSR Sequence #8. The proposed
changes were a radical departure from the contents of Component 5 as described in the PAD, and
although they were not adopted after the MTR they appear throughout the supervision record whenever
the Component is discussed. This is confusing, and may have contributed to the lack of focus evident in
the supervision of implementing the component.

2.2.4 In early 2005, the focus of supervision began to shift towards fiduciary aspects and the
achievement of some key outputs, especially the issuance of titles. As a result, the implementation of
the project became distorted and components and sub-components became de-coupled. Implementation
shifted towards the “easier? physical aspects and began to neglect the more difficult institutional aspects.
As identified later by the Enhanced Review Mission (ERM) of mid-2009 “… the well defined and
intertwined components and activities of the project have been disconnected from each other, with
implementation focusing on the most successful parts (training, works, and titling and registering non-
disputed land … the land policy and legal framework) while not addressing the other activities that would
have helped to fully achieve the development objective to improve land security.?. Important among the
“other activities? were those that were to have been implemented by civil society organizations, including
legal aid and public awareness, community participation and state land mapping.

2.2.5 Suspension of Disbursements. Between July 2004 and September 2005, the Bank undertook a
Fiduciary Review that led to investigations that uncovered evidence of corruption, collusion and
fraudulent practices in 49 contracts in seven Bank-financed projects (of which four, including the project,
were under implementation) the results of which were transmitted to the Region in May 2006. The Bank
declared mis-procurement on 17 civil works contracts under the project, resulting in the suspension of
disbursements to the project on June 6, 2006 that was ultimately lifted on February 2, 2007. These
actions on the part of the Bank put a strain on relations with the Government and the implementing
agency.

2.2.6 Extension of the Closing Date. On December 31, 2007, the Closing Date of the Credit was
extended by two years, until December 31, 2009, with strong support from the Development Partners.
The rationale for extension, in addition to compensating for the months of disbursement suspension,
cited: (a) the continued progress of project implementation, especially in the areas of policy formulation,
educational development and systematic titling in rural areas; (b) the project‟s success in issuing land
titles, having reached the target of one million adjudicated titles; (c) the submission of outstanding audit
reports and corresponding efforts to improve management oversight of performance-based field
allowances; and (d) the pending negotiations to install an Independent Procurement Agent. Building on
this success, the extension expanded the project to three new provinces to be largely funded by CIDA.
There was an internal debate within the Regional Management Team on the duration of the extension. A
key reason for the two-year extension was to allow for the procurement through International Competitive
Bidding of five civil works contracts to be completed by November 2009 though these were never
completed. Moreover, the extension would allow for deeper work on land policies, institutional reform

                                                    10
and incentives for land administration officials. With the focus on fiduciary matters following the INT
investigations and the Bank‟s suspension of disbursements, the extension of the Closing Date imposed
four conditions related to special audits and reconciling payments made for titles delivered, which had
only been partially met by the Closing Date of the Credit. Progress in implementation of the covenants
agreed at the time of extension was as follows: (a) an “ageing analysis?, which linked payment made for
titles delivered and titles adjudicated but not yet delivered, was completed; (b) a re-designed Productivity-
Based Incentive Scheme (PBIS) was completed in January 2009; (c) the delivery of the titles which had
been adjudicated had seen very little progress; and (d) the contracting, by May 31, 2008 of an
independent technical auditor had not been completed. The requirement to conduct the technical audit of
the performance-based incentives to Land Registration Teams was reiterated to the Government (letter of
October 8, 2009) and it was proposed that IDA funds could be used to finance this audit, for which an
escrow account would be created. Formal confirmation by the Government of its agreement was
expected, but this remained an unresolved issue after the Closing Date of the Credit (and is recorded as
such in the final ISR of March 9, 2010).

2.2.7 The risk to the development outcome increased significantly in the latter stages of the project‟s
implementation when the Municipality of Phnom Penh (MPP) implemented involuntary resettlement of
urban poor communities including a large-scale resettlement from the BKL area located in the Srah Chak
District in central Phnom Penh. The resettlement procedures and compensation options presented to
families living in the affected area were developed by the MPP without the involvement of the Project
Management Office (PMO) or the application of the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). Continuing
evictions raise questions about the Government‟s commitment to protect the rights of vulnerable
communities living on state land and those with uncertain tenure status.

2.2.8 Based on available data, only about 10–20 per cent of subsequent transactions in land parcels
titled under the project are being registered because of corruption and inefficiency in the process. This
issue poses major threats to the integrity and sustainability of the cadastre.

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E design and implementation. Frequent reference is made in the PAD to monitoring and
evaluation. However, there is no mention of how or by whom an M&E system was supposed to be
designed, beyond the statement under “Other Conditions? that the system would be developed by
December 31, 2002 (a condition that was not included in the DCA). The Project Management Manual
prepared in 2001 contained only three brief and unconnected references to M&E. The need to establish
an M&E system was reiterated in the MTR in late 2004. In June 2005, the supervision mission was still
lamenting the fact that there was no M&E framework. As recommended in the MTR (of September 2004),
establishing a systematic and robust M&E system for LMAP continues to be very urgent. … no progress
has been made to advance the establishment of an M&E system. An overall M&E system with agreed
indicators (should) be developed and implemented as soon as possible?. Aide Memoire of the Seventh
Supervision Mission, June 2005. A major effort was made, using TA and beginning in 2005, to diagnose
the status of M&E and to install a properly functioning system. An M&E Manual was finally adopted in
December 2006 and was described as being comprehensive, sound and practical. The project began to
apply the M&E system through a unit that had received special training; however, as reported in the Ninth
Supervision Mission Aide Memoire by mid-2007 “insufficient time had elapsed since the adoption of the
new system for outputs to be delivered and for the mission to assess system effectiveness.? An assessment
was made of the existing M&E “system? in December 2005 (LMAP M&E Review Final Report: Land
Equity (Tony Burns), December 2005). This was preceded by a GTZ-funded TA study (Kimmel, 2004)
and an assessment (LMAP M&E Assessment Report: Walter Salzar, April 2005) and subsequent re-
design (LMAP M&E Re-design Report: Walter Salzer, June 2006).


                                                     11
2.3.2 M & E utilization: the M&E system was described as functioning well by mid-2008 (i.e., six
months after the original Closing Date), and was particularly useful in collecting data from the provinces
for compilation of an “aging analysis? that illustrated the age profile of titles as the process of
adjudication, signing and delivery of titles was followed. This was considered to be a particularly useful
management tool. However, in general it cannot be said that data was evaluated or used to inform
decision-making and resource allocation to any great extent.

2.3.3 The approach to M&E adopted under the project practically guaranteed that the system would be
inadequate to the task. The vaguely-specified PDOs and indicators would have required sophisticated
base-line studies and the repeated collection of panel data throughout the life of the project. The
collection of the type of information required by the stated PDOs and indicators was never contemplated,
and this was a failure of the project‟s design. Consultants engaged to work on M&E in 2004 and 2006
produced systems that were, from an MLMUPC perspective, complex and “unworkable? (BCR). The
extent to which the lack of a functioning M&E system during a large part of the project‟s life was
responsible for some of the problems experienced is debatable; in general, there seems to have been a
large amount of information generated at different points in the implementation mechanism that was not
properly collated or shared.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Fiduciary Review (July 2004). Between July 2004 and September 2005, the Bank undertook a
Fiduciary Review of the its portfolio involving the Region, the Government and INT. The Review led to
further INT investigations that uncovered evidence of corruption, collusion and fraudulent practices in 49
contracts in seven Bank-financed projects (of which four, including the LMAP, were under
implementation). The results of this investigation were transmitted to the Region in May 2006.

2.4.2 Suspension of disbursements under the Credit (June 2006). The Bank declared mis-
procurement on 17 civil works contracts under the project and suspended disbursements from the Credit
supporting the project on June 6, 2006. This misprocurement resulted in the cancellation of a portion of
the Credit and a refund by the Borrower of certain disbursements. In addition, the Bank further identified
serious fiduciary concerns related to performance-based field allowances and delays in the
implementation of good governance measures. The project‟s Internal Auditor had also identified serious
issues regarding LRTs demanding additional payments from land-holders and the misuse of vehicles and
equipment. The suspension of disbursements and ongoing fiduciary issues, coupled with the
Government‟s objections to the investigation process, constrained the dialogue between the Bank and the
Government on the project and more broadly.

2.4.3 Lifting of the suspension of disbursements. For the Bank to lift the suspension of
disbursement, the MLMUPC had to meet the following requirements: (a) to prepare an Action Plan for
the review of the design of the project; (b) to appoint an Independent procurement Agent (IPA) to
undertake all outstanding procurement activities; (c) to apply fiduciary control mechanisms; (d) to apply
good governance measures to combat corruption and fraud; and (e) to undertake a review of existing and
proposed TA. On February 5, 2007, the Bank lifted the suspension after determining that the Government
had met these conditions.

2.4.4 The Request for Inspection. In late 2008, NGOs drew the attention of the Bank to their concerns
about the effectiveness of the project in poor urban communities. Following the eviction of the Dey
Krahorm community in Phnom Penh (which was not an LMAP Adjudication Area) in early 2009 and the
threats of eviction made to other areas (none of which were Adjudication Areas under the project), the
Bank became concerned that the apparent acceleration of urban evictions might harm project-affected
people. Consequently, an Enhanced Review of the project was instituted particularly as it related to

                                                   12
resettlement. A dialogue with the Government was started on this topic. The ERM report concluded that
the project had “… delivered undisputed benefits, including the registering and titling of nearly one
million parcels of land? in addition to “… institutional strengthening, enhancing the land policy and legal
framework, and strengthening the Cadastral Commissions?. However, there was considered to be a
“disconnect? between these achievements and “… (the) insecurity of land tenure for the poor, especially
in urban areas, and for indigenous people.?. The RGC in its BCR takes issue with the way in which the
ERM was handled and some of its findings. Concern is expressed that a “10 day ERM mission? was
fielded to “assess the work of 2,500 days of project implementation? (p.93). In particular the Completion
Report takes issue with the ERM finding that entire provinces/municipalities be considered as project
areas, affirming rather that the project was only intended to deal with land titling issues within declared
adjudication areas.

2.4.5 In August 2009, a Safeguards Review Supplemental Supervision Mission was carried out to
assess the applicability and actual application of the project‟s Environmental and Social Guidelines (ESG)
in project Adjudication Areas in general and in the BKL area in particular. The mission was unable to
meet the PMO or other Government counterparts. The mission was unable to exchange views or obtain
documents concerning the application of the ESG during the project‟s implementation, including the
events in the BKL area. Extensive and informative contacts were made, however, with numerous NGOs,
the United Nations Office of the High Commission on Human Rights and residents of the BKL area.

2.4.6 In September 2009, a Request for Investigation was received and registered by the Inspection
Panel. The principal complaint concerned the involuntary resettlement of people from the BKL area. The
Management Response of November 2, 2009, agreed with the complaint that the RPF should have been
applied to the people who were moved, but the Government does not accept this ruling.

2.4.7 The DCA (Schedule 4. III.1) states, in part, that the Borrower shall ensure that the RPF is applied
“in the event of eviction from state land…under Parts C (b) and (c) of the Project.? Part C (b) of the
project refers to the “carrying out of a systematic land titling program in the Project Provinces.? The
Sras Chok adjudication area was an area in which the project was carrying out systematic land titling;
hence, the RPF would apply. Management has been unable to determine definitively whether the area in
question was formally titled in the name of the State, which is one of the instances in which the
application of the RPF was foreseen. Nevertheless, the actions taken by the MPP in leasing the land
confirm that the Government had de facto made a determination that the land in question was State land.
In these circumstances management concluded that to exclude the application of the RPF to evictions in a
project Adjudication Area, because the adjudication process was apparently not followed to its conclusion
and no formal title was issued in the name of the State, would be contrary to the intentions underlying the
development of the RPF as set out in the DCA.

2.4.8 The Management Response committed the Bank to engage the Government and the Development
Partners: (a) to ensure that people displaced from the BKL area would be supported in a manner
consistent with the RPF; (b) to ensure that any future resettlement would benefit from a resettlement
policy that “meets appropriate standards? and from a fair mechanism of dispute resolution; (c) to discuss
the needs of other resettlement sites to improve their conditions; and (d) to encourage the Government to
act on environmental concerns in the BKL area and to mitigate the adverse environmental impact of
filling the lake. However, relatively little progress was made in early 2010 with this agenda, and at the
beginning of April the Inspection Panel announced its intention to carry out a full investigation of the
project.

2.4.9 A Panel team visited Cambodia between May 22-29, 2010, and on November 23, 2010, the Panel
issued its Investigation Report (The Inspection Panel: Report No. 58016-KH) in which its findings are
organized according to the five main claims of the requesters:

                                                    13
        (a) that the events in the BKL area are linked to the project;
        (b) that residents of the BKL area were denied adjudication of their property claims under the
        project;
        (c) that residents of the BKL area were displaced in violation of the Bank‟s policy on involuntary
        resettlement;
        (d) that the titling process adopted by the project weakened pre-existing tenure rights; and
        (e) that other communities in Project Provinces also experienced forced evictions.

2.4.10 The Bank‟s Management prepared and delivered to the Panel and the Board of Executive
Directors its Management Report and Recommendation, dated January 21, 2011. The Investigation
Report and the Management report and Recommendation were discussed by the Board on March 8, 2011.
The Board approved Management‟s Action Plan for addressing the issues raised by the Panel.

2.4.11 Management noted in their report that the “Government does not believe that the BKL site meets
the criteria for triggering the RPF, specifically, that no titles have been issued in the name of the State. As
a consequence, resettlement from the BKL area has been taking place without reference to the RPF.?
Furthermore Management acknowledged “that a lack of specificity in Project documents and the absence
of detailed discussions about the reach of the RPF may have contributed to subsequent differing
interpretations regarding the Government‟s obligations? and that despite a “sustained effort to discuss and
agree with Government on this fundamental point, to date the Government has not recognized any link
between the Project and BKL events. These positions are reaffirmed in the Borrower‟s Completion
Report. In August 2011 the Government issued a sub-decree (#183), giving over 700 families still living
near the lake approximately 12 hectares of land on the planned development site and the government
issued titles to 259 of these families on December 10, 2011.

2.4.12 Special Technical Audit. When the Closing Date of the DCA was extended in December 2007, a
condition of the extension was that a Special Technical Audit would be carried out of PBFA payments
made as an incentive to land registration teams to increase productivity. The first Special Audit was
conducted by KPMG in early 2008 covering the period October 1, 2003 - March, 31 2007. The results of
this audit were unsatisfactory as there were difficulties with interpretation of the requirements of the
terms of reference; the auditor did not provide an audit opinion but rather completed “agreed upon
procedures? after consultation with the project management. Subsequent to the audit, the Bank‟s
financial management (FM) team completed a reconciliation of the advances given to the LRTs for the
period October 1, 2003 - December 31, 2007, based on the data provided by the project with the
assumption that all the adjudicated data up to December 31, 2007 would be fully delivered by the Credit‟s
Closing Date. As a result, an overpayment of US$131,000 was calculated, the result of under-
performance of LRTs in the urban areas. The overpaid amount was deducted from a Withdrawal
Application submitted by the project, and the amount was subsequently refunded by the project after the
Closing Date.

2.4.13 The Bank and the Government agreed at that time that the total overpaid amount from the
shortfall of the scheme would be determined based on the result of the second Special Audit covering the
entire implementation period. The signature of the contract for this audit was repeatedly delayed and had
not been achieved before the Closing Date of December 31, 2009. The Government agreed in a letter
dated April 6, 2010 to set aside a national budget of US$ 140,000 to finance this second Special Audit
and has recently completed a new bidding process for the selection of a suitable audit firm. The bidding
was handled by the IPA under the contract with MEF, and the special audit contract has been sent to the



                                                      14
selected firm for signature. The audit is commenced in October, 2011 and a draft report is expected by
December 31, 2011.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Perhaps the most important consequence of the rift that occurred between the Bank and the
Government at the end of the project‟s implementation period is the fact that there are, in effect, no
“arrangements for the project‟s future operation?. The Government continues to support land titling
without the Bank‟s involvement and, with over 500,000 titles having been adjudicated from September
2009 to the end of 2010, for the time being the systematic titling process continues apace. In 2008, initial
discussions were under way concerning the preparation of a follow-on operation to continue the
implementation of the LAMDP.

2.5.2 It has already been remarked that the LAMDP‟s originally-stated duration of fifteen years was, in
practice, far too short a time period; international comparisons indicate that perhaps twice that length of
time would have been necessary to complete the work. A cadastre and land administration system can be
viewed as a living system that unless it is maintained and up-dated is destined to deteriorate to the point
where its value is completely undermined. The very real achievements of the project are therefore
threatened.

2.5.3 In mid-2007, the MLMUPC had announced a sector-wide approach to land, with three sub-sector
programs for land administration, land management and land distribution. The Government has
ambitious targets for land titling, and the activities of the Land Administration Sub-Sector Program
(LASSP) continue.

2.5.4 The Development Partners (the Governments of Canada, Denmark, Germany and Finland)
remain engaged with the MLMUPC in support of the Government's land programs. German-funded TA
for the land sector has been provided through GTZ since 1995. A program of continued support in the
amount of €4.0 million was announced August 2010, contingent on the "strengthening of human rights in
the land sector", in particular the land rights of indigenous communities and unapproved urban
settlements. Canada has a land management and administration project that provides TA and direct
support to titling in three target provinces (Kampong Chhnang, Pursat and Banteay Meanchey) with a
commitment of C$8.5 million for the period 2005-2011. Currently financed through 2012, Finland is
funding TA to Component 3 of the LASSP - Land Titling and Development of a Modern Multi-Purpose
Cadastral System with a commitment of approximately €5.0 million for the period 2009-2012. Denmark
has a US$6.65 program that supports MLMUPC in relation to land management activities, especially
land-use planning under the Natural Resources Management and Livelihoods Program supported by the
United Kingdom‟s Department for International Development and the Danish International Development
Agency, but these activities are not expected to be continued beyond the current phase of the Program that
comes to an end in 2011.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 The Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The project‟s objectives, although expressed in vague and qualitative terms, were and remain
highly relevant; they are fully consistent with Cambodia‟s development priorities and with current Bank
country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals. The main objective of the CAS in effect at
the time of preparation and appraisal was to help build the foundations for sustainable development and
poverty reduction. The first of three identified foundations was “… good governance including an
efficient and accountable public administration and a credible legal and judicial framework that

                                                    15
safeguards basic human and property rights?. The project lay at the very heart of this foundation. A
fundamental principle of the CAS was for development partners to work more closely together in support
of the Government‟s reform agenda and to increase the efficiency of aid utilization. The design of the
project was fully compatible with this; it incorporated German and Finnish bilateral assistance and built
upon pilot projects funded from it since the mid-1990s. The CAS also was designed to pave the way for a
gradual transition from an individual project-based approach to a concerted approach based on shared
sector strategies and expenditure programs.

3.1.2 The subsequent CAS covered the period FY05-08 but has, in practice, remained current to the
present.
Central to this CAS is that poor governance is the fundamental brake on the effectiveness of the Bank‟s
activities and the achievement of development outcomes in Cambodia. The first pillar of the CAS is
aimed at reducing the governance constraints that hold back inclusive, sustainable growth and pro-poor
service delivery. The CAS Objective 2 is to improve natural resource management in order to contribute
to sustainable rural growth and poverty reduction. Working closely with the in-country Thematic
Working Groups for Land and for Forestry and Environment, the Bank‟s analytical and financial support
is intended to be coordinated with other donors to strengthen the overall framework for the management
of land resources. Several operations were identified to continue to emphasize the importance and
centrality of land issues:
(a) the Poverty Reduction and Growth Operation covering the period 2007-2009 was approved in July
2007 to support the implementation of the “good governance? reform program, and had as its primary
objective “… to support the next phase of policy and institutional reform required to maintain growth and
accelerate poverty reduction by … guaranteeing land tenure and increasing access to the land for the
rural poor …?(ref. PRGO Program Document No. 36553-KH, June 18, 2007);
(b) a credit for the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development (LASED) project was
approved in May 2008; the development objective of the pilot program is to improve the process for
identification and use of state lands transferred to eligible, poor and formerly landless or land-poor
recipients selected through a transparent and well-targeted process; and
(c) a “second phase? of LMAP was intended to be started in 2008.

3.1.3 A CAS Progress Report was presented in April 2008 and proposed to extend the CAS period
through until FY11. It emphasized the challenging nature of structural reform and governance issues, and
stated that progress towards improving natural resource management had been solid and that the
Government‟s land titling program supported by the LMAP had been a notable success. For the extended
CAS period, Bank support for improved land and natural resources management was to be based on the
progress achieved during the previous five years whilst adapting to critical issues not anticipated during
the original CAS period “… due mainly to rapid increases in land values which are driving an
increasingly informal land market.?. It was the intention during the extended CAS period to use
Analytical and Advisory (AAA) services and trust funds to research the incentives driving land markets
and to identify practical approaches to addressing the pressures between rapid economic development and
safe-guarding the livelihoods of the poor in urban areas and indigenous communities. This was to inform
the design of the Bank‟s role in the proposed LMAP2 in FY10 in a multi-donor program-based approach.

3.1.4 The project‟s design was fully consistent with the stated objectives, although many other factors
besides titling and improved land administration systems are involved in improving land tenure security
and developing efficient land markets. The project‟s implementation, however, was not fully consistent
with the design in several important aspects; although titling made spectacular progress, the creation of
the policy and institutional environment suffered from shortcomings that affect the functioning of land
administration. It would be an over-simplification, however, to view the project‟s history as one of “good
design – poor implementation?. The relatively weak political economy analysis led to defects in the

                                                   16
project design, which was “theoretically? sound but in practice proved to be not implementable as a
coherent whole.

3.1.5 The project suffered because of its weak Results Framework: achievements against the PDOs
were difficult to assess and in the absence of relevant base-line data or a defined methodology for
collecting data the improvement in land tenure security (PDO#1) could not be measured. In the case of
improving the land market (PDO#2), the BAs indicate an increase in the number of land transactions and
in the collection of taxes and fees, both of which point in the direction of an “improvement?; however, the
absence of a base-line and of a data measurement methodology means that such improvement cannot be
measured or attributed to the project. Once more, the importance is emphasized of having a Project
Design Summary that articulates clear and reachable objectives with a methodology of collecting
measurable data on outcomes and impacts.

 3.1.6 The principal problem with the definition of the PDOs is that it describes the context in great
detail (i.e., the overall goals of the project, the LAMDP and its objectives, and how the objectives will be
achieved) but describes the actual PDOs in only the vaguest of terms – and then proposes even vaguer
KPIs to measure their achievement. It would have been simpler if the objectives had been specified in
technical and verifiable terms; for example, the creation of a land administration systems and a number of
titles.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1 PDO#1 was highly qualitative, and unfortunately the five KPIs established to define the degree of
achievement of the objective were themselves either subjective or hard to measure. Since the importance
and immediacy of the whole issue of M&E was down-played in design and early implementation, and
neither the methodology nor the base-line was developed that would have allowed these KPIs to be
measured over the life of the project. In all five of the KPIs there was a potential issue of attribution;
even if values could be assigned to these indicators, it would be close to impossible to state with any
accuracy what portion of the “improvement? had actually been caused by the project‟s interventions.
PDO#2 was also qualitative; although the two KPIs can be measured accurately, the issue of attribution
remains. Additional information on the achievement of the PDO and IO Indicators is presented in the
Results Framework Analysis (Data Sheet, Section G) and in Annex 11.

                PDOs                                                 KPIs
 1. To improve land tenure          1. A reduction in conflict over land.
 security (for urban and            2. A reduction in “land grabbing?.
 agricultural land-holders).        3. An increase in agricultural productivity.
                                    4. An increase in access to (cheaper) credit.
                                    5. An increase in investment in the property sector.
 2. To promote the development of   1. An increase in the number of land transactions.
 efficient land markets.            2. An increase in the taxes and fees collected from land transactions.

3.2.2 A reduction in conflict over land: without a base-line or defined methodology to collect and
interpret data, the achievements of the project, if any, in helping to reduce conflict over land cannot be
estimated

3.2.3 A reduction in land-grabbing: without a base-line or defined methodology to collect and
interpret data, the achievements of the project, if any, in helping to reduce land-grabbing cannot be
estimated.



                                                      17
3.2.4 A reduction in conflict over land and a reduction in land-grabbing (and forced eviction) are
obviously related issues. Neither concept is defined in the PAD in a conclusive manner. It has been
pointed out by numerous observers that the concept of land in Cambodia being capable of categorization
as “with? or “without? conflict is misleading; there is in fact a whole spectrum from “very little conflict?
to “total conflict?. The whole process of systematic titling, in practice, is one of low-level conflict
resolution in which adjoining parcel owners are encouraged and assisted to resolve differences of opinion
in order that the titling process can move forward. In systematic titling, the failure to resolve differences
(e.g., on parcel corner-points) results in titles not being prepared and issued, and this is a powerful
incentive to the parties to reach a compromise solution and not to allow the perfect to become the enemy
of the good. The BCR reports over 20,000 disputes were resolved by the Administrative Commissions as
part of the systematic titling process.

3.2.5 As pointed out in the ERM, a decision was taken during project design that “… the project will
not title lands in areas where disputes are likely until agreements are reached on the status of the land?.
However, clarifying the status of land required the development and implementation of clear procedures
for State land classification, while procedures were developed under Component 5 they were not
implemented in part due to challenges with inter-ministerial coordination. The BCR acknowledges
“failure to date of a general program on state land mapping has been regrettable? but asserts that this
failure “has been completely out of MLMUPC‟s control.?Absent such a process a “vicious circle? was
created whereby whole communes were declared by Provincial government for systematic titling however
certain households within those communes who were deemed to be in areas where “disputes are likely?
were effectively excluded from participating in the titling process without clear criteria or explanation.
As pointed out in the ERM, to the extent that “… eviction occurred in disputed lands which are excluded
from the scope of the LMAP, the resettlement and safeguards policy framework has not been tested.?

3.2.6 While no systematic study of the issue of household exclusion from adjudication areas has yet
been completed, a draft Independent Review of LMAP dated February 2006, prepared under contract to
other Development Partners highlighted this issue. As the Inspection Panel quoted from the report… “at
least a fifth of households (19.6%) in 13 of the adjudication areas visited are being adversely affected by
the systematic land titling process, usually through the refusal to register land in household possession or
use.? Unfortunately the draft study was never finalized or accepted by Government. The Bank recognizes
that disagreements over the Independent Report‟s methodology and findings kept it from being finalized
and shared. Nevertheless, in the Bank‟s view, despite methodological flaws, the 2006 report raised valid
concerns and proper consideration of the report might have brought the issue of adjudicating private
claims on land claimed by the State to prominent attention at an earlier point in Project implementation.

3.2.7 In order that a critical mass of titles (≥ one million) could be created, the project concentrated on
those areas where land parcels were clearly defined and where land-holders had a powerful incentive to
resolve (mainly minor) disputes. By contrast, households in areas where significant disputes were likely
were effectively excluded from the titling process, while weaknesses in the dispute resolution and state
land management components of the project (components 4 & 5) meant that a framework for fairly
resolving these disputes was not put in place. It was undoubtedly an exaggeration or over-reach to
believe that the project could do anything about land-grabbing, which is principally a problem in the areas
where disputes are likely. Powerful forces are at work that prospers in this penumbra of asymmetrical
information and influence. The Bank‟s political economy analysis was weak, with the result that ideas
that were peripherally discussed at appraisal were in practice much larger than imagined or presented. It
is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Bank was more than a little naïve, and perhaps engaging in
“wishful thinking?, when it approached the important subject of land-grabbing. The scale of the problem
in present-day Cambodia is clearly described in a number of publications with no effective resolution in
sight (see for example Land Grabbing and Poverty in Cambodia: The Myth of Development, Cambodia
League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, May 2009; Statistical Analysis on Land

through Possession or Title through Position?, Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions, November 2008;

of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, June 2007).

3.2.8 An increase in agricultural productivity: without a base-line or defined methodology to collect
and interpret data, the achievements of the project, if any, in raising agricultural productivity on titled
land cannot be estimated. The assumed thread of causation is that possession of a title gives the
individual farmer the confidence that investments in improvements in his land and in the use of his land
will be secure for him and his family. The analysis of the impact on productivity of granting a title
requires detailed econometric analysis on the production functions of typical farming units. This would
have required sampling, detailed farm system analysis and the collection of panel data in order to be able
to measure any increases in productivity and the apportionment of weights to the factors of production.
None of this was provided for in the project‟s design.

3.2.9 An increase in access to credit: Two BAs were carried out during the implementation of the
project (in 2006 and 2009) with the main purpose of gauging overall beneficiary satisfaction and the
impact of land titles in the areas covered by LMAP. The studies used a mixed methods approach to gauge
perceptions and satisfaction levels and to provide recommendations on how to improve the titling
processes put in place by the project. The first BA covered 12 randomly-selected sites in nine provinces
and Phnom Penh for a total of 309 interviews; it concluded that the majority of beneficiaries were
satisfied with the titles received and that the adjudication process had met or exceeded expectations of the
majority of respondents. Some further conclusions were that: (a) the registration fee levels were
acceptable; and (b) nearly half of respondents claimed access to credit as the key benefit from titling,
although only 19 per cent of them actually had loans outstanding. The study also suggested that the
effects on credit access in the short term are limited and that the longer the time period elapsed since
obtaining the titles the greater the number of landowners accessing credit.
3.2.10 The second BA conducted in 2009 (10 randomly selected sites, for a total of 485 beneficiaries
interviewed plus separate focus group discussions for men and women covering 114 landowners)
reinforced the findings of the first BA. There was general satisfaction with the process of titling and the
registration fees. Improved access to credit and reduced conflict over land were seen as the main benefits
from titling. Interviews with four banks and micro-finance institutions (MFIs) indicated that possession
of a land title is generally not a major consideration for smaller loans, but often speeds up the process of
loan approval and helps to qualify borrowers for larger loans. In addition, representatives of institutions
also mentioned that the increase of in the number of titles made it easier for them to avoid overlapping
loans being secured by same property.
3.2.11 An increase in investment in the property sector: the economic analysis described in Section
3.3 is based on the impact of titling in terms of: (a) better terms of credit (lower interest rate) for small
loans; and (b) the possibility of accessing medium-sized loans. The very significant increase in the size of
the aggregate loan portfolio can be attributed in part to the emergence and use of land titles, although the
“titling effect? cannot be quantified. Similarly, we can confidently state that there has been an increase in
investment but we cannot quantify it or define the sectors in which it has been made.
3.2.12 An increase in the number of land transactions: Some 24 per cent of respondents to the first
BA perceived that there had been an increase in land transactions post-titling. This is compared to 8 per
cent who perceived a decrease and 68 per cent who responded “no change? or “do not know?. The second
BA indicated a strong perception that land transactions were on the rise until mid-2008 when the global
economic slow-down appears to have shut down the market. The BAs offer no insight on the link
between land titling and increases in land transactions.


                                                     19
3.2.13 An increase in the taxes and fees collected from land transactions: The second BA cites
revenue from the registration of land at U$60 million since 2003, but the proportion of this total that can
be attributed to the project cannot be determined.
3.2.14 Although the lack of data prevents a quantitative assessment of outcomes, a qualitative
assessment is presented in the Data Sheet and Annex 11. The results of that assessment for both PDO
Indicators and Intermediate Outcome Indicators can be summarized as follows:

                                                                 Results Achieved
                                            Achieved     Partly Achieved    Not Achieved    Not Assessed
 PDO Indicators (7)                            1                -                1               5
 Intermediate Outcome Indicators (24)          10                4                10              -


This shows that although 10 of the 24 Intermediate Outcome Indicators are judged to have been achieved,
this did not translate into more than one of the PDO Indicators being achieved. This is a disappointing
result. Even for the one PDO Indicator, the achievement is qualified as “probable?. Information
problems made it impossible to judge four PDO outcomes even in qualitative terms. The fact that ten
Intermediate Outcome Indicators were assessed as “not achieved? naturally affects the possibility of
PDOs being achieved.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 A detailed financial and economic analysis was carried out during the preparation of this ICR and
is presented in Annex 3.

Efficiency Considerations at Appraisal

3.3.2 At appraisal, the main benefits of the project were expected to be: (a) improved land tenure
security; (b) increased investment from better access to credit and a more secure investment climate; (c) a
greater efficiency of land use via the formation and improvement of land markets; (d) improved tax
collection and land-use planning; and (e) improved management of natural resources. However, these
benefits were expected to be fully realized only over the long term, and their achievement during the life
of the project was considered as “… not likely to be evident.?

3.3.3 It was considered not possible to provide quantitative estimates of project benefits, and no ex ante
economic analysis was attempted. However, the PAD contained a plan to conduct an ex post economic
analysis, with base-line and socio-economic impact surveys conducted in selected project areas during
implementation. The base-line studies were carried out (albeit long after the start-up of the project) but
the socio-economic surveys were not; as a result, there is no coherent and consistent body of information
generated under the project on which to base this anticipated, detailed economic analysis for the ICR.

3.3.4 Financial analysis was conducted at appraisal to assess the net financial benefits expected from
the project for the key project participants (i.e., landholders and the Government).

3.3.5 The analysis prepared for the ICR is based on some studies and reports generated under the
project and on additional data collected during and after the ICR mission. An analysis has been made of
the actual project costs and the appraisal estimates; the results are presented in Annex 1.



                                                    20
3.3.6 Cost of titles: At appraisal, the expected cost to produce a title and maintain it over a ten-year
period was estimated to be US$38.10. During the project, through improved project management and
scale economies, the average cost per title decreased progressively from 2002 to 2009, averaging $16.80.
In 2009, taking only the project activities directly related to titling, the cost per title was US$11.

3.3.7 Because of the lack of detail on the composition of costs (to understand which are directly related
to titling), this analysis considers three “cost scenarios?:


                                   Scenario                                           Cost per Title (US$)
                                                                                   2002-2009            2007-2009
  I All project costs directly and indirectly associated with land titling           37.00                24.80
  II Component 3 costs                                                                 -                    -
 III Sub-components 3.1 and 3.2 costs                                                16.80                12.40

3.3.8 Financial analysis at the level of landholders: There are two main theoretical incentives for
obtaining a title (improved security of land ownership and improved access to credit). In the absence of
further data, the ICR identifies improved access to credit as the main direct benefit of the project for
landholders. The analysis is based on comparing the stream of financial benefits from access to credit
with the costs associated with the registration procedures. Better terms of credit can be obtained by
providing a land title as collateral. There are also benefits from having a title in terms of the speed of
processing the loan and the terms of the loan. The evidence is clearest with medium and large loans; with
micro- and small loans (those between a few hundred and US$10.000) there is lack of evidence of any
quantitative benefit from titling in terms of access to credit. The latter seem also to be the majority of the
beneficiaries of loans. Taking the ACLEDA Bank PLC portfolio as an example, small and micro loans
account for around 90 per cent of all loans provided in 2009 (in number terms) but just 34 per cent in
terms of US$ value of credit provided by the institution.

3.3.9 Financial analysis at the level of the Government: At appraisal, the financial analysis at the
level of the Government showed a 22 per cent financial rate of return (FRR) and a net present value
(NPV) of US$15.4 million (@ 10 per cent discount rate), based on the distribution of 1.1 million titles, a
30 year evaluation period, project costs, and benefits from registration fees, subsequent transaction
registration fees and transfer tax revenues. The main component of the benefit stream was the transfer tax
revenue, which accounted for 66 per cent of the NPV of all fiscal revenues estimated.

3.3.10 An ex post analysis has been re-calculated for three scenarios of fiscal impact to assess the net
fiscal revenue stream. Costs and benefits are compared for the period 2002-2024, and the results suggest
that the project presents satisfactory fiscal returns.

                   Scenario                           Net Present Value             Economic Rate of Return
                                                           (NPV)                            (ERR)
                                                    (US$ million at 12 per cent)               (per cent)
 I All project costs directly and indirectly                   10.0                              16.0
    associated with land titling
 II Component 3 costs                                          22.0                              26.0
 III Sub-components 3.1 and 3.2                                24.0                              27.9

3.3.11 Economic analysis: The PAD lists the main expected benefits from the project and describes a
proposed methodology to calculate NPV and ERR. The main benefits in urban areas would be measured
through “... land price changes due to titling while holding other factors constant…? and in rural areas

                                                        21
benefits would be quantified as the “... incremental increase in production and associated income from
titling, subtracting the value of the investment inputs…?.

3.3.12 The quantitative assessment of the impact of the project on landholders through the identified
channels is difficult, given the lack of data. This is particularly true for the first channel (limiting
expropriation) and its results, in terms of enhanced investment and reducing the need to divert private
resources to protect property. However, for the second channel (facilitating market transactions) it is
possible to provide an estimate of the impact of land titling on access to credit, in line with the financial
analysis conducted.

3.3.13 A direct causal relationship between areas targeted under systematic land titling and the
increasing size and number of loans in the same areas could not be established because of the lack of data.
However, as anticipated in the base-line studies, between 2002 and 2009 there was a shift in the number,
size and intended use of loans provided by different financial institutions. The calculations at ICR
illustrate the economic impact of the project through some assumptions and sensitivity analysis.

3.3.14 The analysis includes the project‟s economic costs, the 2002-2024 time horizon and two types of
benefits: (a) better terms of credit resulting in a higher efficiency of resource allocation; and (b) the
possibility of accessing medium-sized loans that can only be secured with title. The analysis of benefits
takes into consideration the overall credit portfolio in the country, and concludes that the project had an
ERR of 22 per cent and an NPV (@ 12 per cent discount rate) of US$26.5 million. If the benefits on
improved terms of loans are excluded, the ERR is 20.7 per cent and the NPV is US$21.5 million. This
simplified illustration of the benefits suggests that even with extreme assumptions the economic benefits
from one of the channels of impact from titling clearly outweigh the economic costs of the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.4.1 The very real achievements of the project in terms of land titling in areas with limited land issues
must be seen against the significant shortcomings in the establishment of the institutional structure and
policy environment. The objectives were relevant but vaguely expressed, making a judgment about their
achievement difficult if not impossible to arrive at. The design was highly relevant in that all the
identified aspects of land titling and administration had to be included if there was to be any prospect of
success. However, the project design was not based on a realistic articulation of the political context and
as such the project design contained elements that were extremely difficult to implement. To the extent
that they can be measured, some of the key outputs of the project (e.g., titles) were achieved efficiently
but three of the five components were late or not fully implemented.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1 The project was not designed to have specific impacts on poverty, gender or social development.
However, the PAD was bold in terms of the economic and social impact that was expected; it stated that
the range of benefits to be generated from secure land rights (social stability, poverty reduction and
economic growth), improved land administration (efficient land markets and better land use) and
improved capacity for land management (improved environmental management) would improve the lives
of the whole population of Cambodia. In addition, many of the beneficiaries were expected to be “poor



                                                     22
and vulnerable to being dislodged? from their land; secure titles were expected to reduce the risks of
dispossession through “land-grabbing?.
 However, as described in the PAD, the Government‟s reform agenda to promote sustainable economic
and social development, poverty alleviation and peace had the Land Policy Framework as one of its most
significant initiatives. The social assessment that accompanied project preparation showed that disputes
over land were growing as land values were rising, particularly near roads and in urban centers. Without
legal property titles, people could not defend their land rights particularly against outsiders and a major
social development outcome of the project was expected to be that one million plus families, mostly
smallholder farmers, would obtain title and thereby reduce their vulnerability. The number of titles to
land parcels produced under the project exceeded 1.5 million, but there is no evidence of vulnerability
having been reduced. Indeed, research indicates that poverty itself is a more important source of loss of
access to land than land tenure insecurity; on this basis, unless the project had an indirect impact on
poverty it is unlikely to have had a major impact on vulnerability. Based on the 2009 Beneficiary
Assessment and a 2010 study by LMAP Canada the BCR reports that the systematic titling process was
generally implemented in a way that involved and respected the rights of women (see for example
Heinrich Boll Foundation – 2008 - Women’s Perspectives: A Case Study of Systematic Land Registration
in Cambodia, and reports prepared by CIDA under the Cambodia Land Administration Sub-sector Project
(CLASP).

Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 Institutional development was a key feature of the project. In fact, all five project components
were partially or wholly aimed at the development of institutions and their administrative procedures.
The project has had a major impact on the institutions of land management. In this respect the BCR
highlights LMAP‟s contributions to MLMUPC capacity and governance processes. However, the
restructuring of the MLMUPC that was envisaged in the project‟s design was not achieved despite a
major effort by the Bank throughout the life of the project to emphasize its importance.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3 The most important unintended outcome of the project was the impasse between the Bank and the
Government over the treatment of residents of the BKL area, which was triggered by a Request for
Inspection made to the Inspection Panel by an NGO on behalf of residents of the BKL area.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Surveys

3.6.1 Two BAs were carried out during the implementation of the project (in 2006 and 2009) with the
main purpose of gauging overall beneficiary satisfaction and the impact of land titles for the beneficiaries
in areas covered by LMAP. The studies used a “mixed methods? approach to gauge perceptions and
satisfaction levels and to provide recommendations on how to improve the titling processes put in place
by the project.

3.6.2 The first BA covered 12 randomly-selected sites in nine provinces and Phnom Penh for a total of
309 interviews. The assessment concluded that the majority of beneficiaries were satisfied with the land
titles received and that the adjudication process had met or exceeded the expectations of the majority of
respondents. Some further conclusions were that:
        (a) beneficiaries stated that the registration fee levels were acceptable.
        (b) nearly half of respondents claimed access to credit as the key benefit from titling, although
        only 19 per cent had loans outstanding. The study also suggested that the effects on credit access

                                                    23
        In the short term are limited, and that the longer the time period elapsed since obtaining the titles
        the greater the number of landowners accessing credit.

3.6.3 The second BA conducted in 2009 reinforced the findings of the first BA. It was based on ten
randomly-selected sites, for a total of 485 beneficiaries interviewed plus separate focus group discussions
for men and women covering 114 landowners. The main findings were:
        (a) general satisfaction with the process of titling and the level of registration fees.
        (b) the main benefits from titling were improved access to credit and reduced conflict over land.
        Possession of a land title is generally not a major consideration for smaller loans, but has benefits
        for larger loans. Titles help institutions to avoid overlapping loans being secured by the same
        property.
        (c) few subsequent land transactions are registered, given high costs, complexity and lack of
        transparency.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating: Significant

4.1.1 The risk at the time of preparation of this ICR that the development outcome will not be
maintained is considered to be “significant?. Considerable progress was achieved in the establishment of
a modern system of land administration and the production and distribution of titles in the period 2002-
2009. However, there were also institutional shortcomings of crucial importance to the well-being of the
system relating to weak mechanisms for dispute resolution, effective management of state-owned land,
and the rule of law. The absence of effective donor coordination could lead to a piece-meal approach
without tackling the most difficult issues robustly.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.1 The identification of the project was based on a good diagnosis of the main sector issues. Ten
years after the Concept Review, many of these issues remain. To a certain extent, the description of the
sector and its issues had to be “read between the lines? in the PAD but the “near chaos? that existed in the
administration of property rights, spread across several ministries and down from the national to the
provincial and municipal levels, was clearly recognized by the Bank: “It is overwhelmingly clear to both
government and donors that the overriding problem and the one with the greatest contribution to poverty
is lack of land tenure security … and restricted access to common property resources.?.

5.1.2 The problems were far-reaching: a growing number of landless people and land disputes; the
level of ignorance on the part of the state about “the amount, location and boundaries of public land …
much of it not surveyed, mapped or titled?; the dispossession of peoples‟ land by “state agents such as the
military and politically connected?; and the concessions of use of natural resources (such as forests and
wetlands) that “ … seem to be undertaken at provincial level or by politicians at all levels.?. Dire
predictions were made about the consequences of inaction.



                                                    24
5.1.3 Project identification, preparation and appraisal were part of an intensive and well-focused
exercise that covered a period of 18 months (mid-2000 until end-2001) and was supported by four trust
fund grants (see Annex 1). The following criteria of “quality at entry? have been considered:

(a) The project had great strategic relevance and the approach adopted was a straight-forward one,
modeled on successful experiences in other countries of the region, to re-build the physical, legal and
procedural “infrastructure? required for a modern system of land administration. However, “the project
was to be a limited and phased-in contribution to a very complex development problem, although the
Project Description in the PAD failed to make this clear.? Paradoxically, although the project was “a
highly ambitious design in terms of scope and reach, funding constraints and an understanding that the
project needed to be phased-in over time meant that the project was limited in size relative to the overall
needs?(ref. Management Response to the Request for an Inspection Panel Review).
(b) The technical and financial aspects were well structured, but the economic analysis was incomplete.
(c) Poverty and gender issues were not specifically addressed by the project, but a full social assessment
was made during preparation that showed that disputes and “land-grabbing? were increasing, that
squatting and encroachment onto public land were growing problems, and that women, especially those in
female-headed households, were particularly vulnerable. The project‟s goal of helping one million plus
families to obtain titles was therefore a major social development outcome.
(d) The project was not expected to have significant adverse environmental consequences.
(e) A FM assessment concluded that the risks were high, and as a result TA to the PMO was included
and a comprehensive FM arrangement was made, including an FM manual, internal audit, centralized
accounting and regular FM reporting.
(f) The policy and institutional aspects were dealt with thoroughly, and each was the subject of a
complete component in the project‟s final design.
(g) The implementation arrangements were simple and robust.
(h) The M&E arrangements were inadequate. The design of M&E was not part of preparation but was
instead left for an undetermined later date. Although there are frequent references to M&E in the PAD,
there is no description of how or by whom an M&E system is supposed to be created.
(i) The project was considered to be high risk, and although the risks were well identified the
specification of mitigation measures was far from being convincing (and, in practice, they were of little
help when risks actually materialized).
(j) Bank inputs were extensive and were supported by significant trust fund inputs.

5.1.4 The project was the subject of a QEA by the QAG in April 2002 (after the Credit‟s approval but
before its effectiveness); the overall assessment was “satisfactory? and the strategic relevance and
approach was considered to be “highly satisfactory?. The project approach was considered to be well
grounded in experience from nearby countries and in pilot projects undertaken in Cambodia. Three
“shortcomings? were specified: (a) the arrangements for monitoring were still to be determined; (b) the
base-line survey was not expected to start until at least six months after effectiveness; and (c) risks - and
their mitigation measures - could have been better identified and disaggregated. These shortcomings
turned out to be very significant in the implementation of the project.

5.1.5 There were several shortcomings in preparation and appraisal that had important consequences
during implementation: (a) the poorly-specified PDOs and the weak Project Design Summary gave rise to
significant problems with the specification of key performance indicators; (b) the somewhat unrealistic
analysis of risks and definition of countervailing measures gave a false sense of security; (c) the absence
of an agreed procedure for establishing the necessary M&E mechanisms meant that this crucial function

                                                     25
was largely absent until well into the project‟s implementation; and (d) the weak “political economy?
analysis gave rise to a project that contained essential but “un-implementable? components and activities.
As a result, the overall performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at entry is considered to have been
“moderately unsatisfactory?.

Quality of the Bank’s Supervision

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

 5.1.6 The Bank‟s performance in project supervision came under close scrutiny in the preparation of
the Management Response to the Request for an Inspection Panel Review (the Response) in late 2009.
The Response found that despite significant Task Team engagement “the Project drifted away from its
original design and as a result three components were not implemented completely?. Insufficient
attention was paid to safeguards supervision; the Government should have been engaged more
aggressively on the lagging components and the project should have been restructured.

5.1.7 Focus on development impact: the project was designed to provide essential “infrastructure to
improve the security of land tenure and the functioning of land markets. The development impact of the
project was to be measured via the KPIs; as has already been stated, there was no provision in the design
or the appraisal for the creation of the M&E system and the system was only created late in the project‟s
life despite the importance of it being repeated by supervision missions. In general, supervision
concentrated on problem-solving and fiduciary issues, and cannot be said to have been focused on the
project‟s development impact.

5.1.8   Supervision of fiduciary and safeguards aspects: this is discussed in detail in Section 2.4.

5.1.9 Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes: eleven supervision missions, all of them joint
multi-donor missions, were carried out (an average of two per year with the exception of the period of
disbursement suspension) and 17 PSRs and ISRs were prepared. An early and detailed MTR was carried
out, when issues were raised with the Government on a number of concerns. Annex 13 provides a record
of the “key issues and actions? identified during project implementation as they were included in the
supervision record of PSRs and ISRs. Numerous issues and actions are carried forward to the next
reporting period, many of them several times, and often without a revised date for their achievement.
Many of them disappear from the supervision record without it being made clear whether they were, in
fact, achieved. It is noted that the government, in its BCR expresses, significant dissatisfaction with the
Bank‟s supervision of the project. Key points of conjecture include the way in which the 2006
misprocurement issues were handled and a more general concern that the Bank was at times inconsistent
and high handed in its dealings with the MLMUPC and other development partners. The BCR also
presents frustration at “bureaucratic processes that at times seriously slowed down the project? (p.93).
Finally the government is clear that it is disappointed with the way the way the Bank handled the BKL
which it found to be inconsistent and “strange? (p.94).

5.1.10 Candor and quality of performance reporting: The project‟s performance demanded that
supervision efforts be focused on a number of specific aspects. Reporting on performance was candid
and extensive, particularly in supervision aides memoire. Corruption associated with the titling process in
both high-value urban and rural areas was discussed. Following the MTR, the project‟s performance in
issuing titles improved markedly but the Bank‟s relationship with the MLMUPC began to deteriorate. No
titles had been distributed at the time of the MTR in October 2004; by June 2007, 760,000 titles had been
distributed. As has been noted, attention to fiduciary issues (especially procurement and performance-
based field incentives) and, latterly, to the issues surrounding evictions and involuntary resettlement had


                                                    26
the effect of monopolizing supervision resources. A number of ISRs would have benefited from
additional management inputs, particularly when the project was in (or close to) “unsatisfactory? status.
The ISR ratings for “Development Objective? and “Implementation progress? that are summarized in the
Data Sheet Section G appear to have been somewhat inflated for much of the project‟s life, and this may
have contributed to inadequate management attention.

5.1.11 Role in ensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular operation of supported
activities after Credit closing. The events that occurred in late 2008 and 2009 resulted in a near-total
breakdown of communication between the Bank and the project authorities (prior to this, the concept of a
follow-on project had been treated as a near-certainty); as a result, there has been no opportunity for the
Bank to engage in a dialogue concerning transition arrangements to regular operation of the project.


Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.12 The overall performance of the Bank is considered to have been “moderately unsatisfactory?.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government Performance

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.1 The QEA concluded that the Borrower‟s participation level in project design was high and that it
had led a process of reflection and consultation on land policy at the national and provincial levels. The
Government took ownership of the project and was broadly committed to achieving the PDOs. The
enabling environment was moderately supportive. Consultations with and involvement of beneficiaries
and stakeholders was adequate during preparation but less so during implementation. In particular, the
Government‟s relationship with NGOs, which were expected to participate actively in the project in
facilitating community participation and in providing legal assistance for poor landholders, was not
satisfactory but for complex reasons not solely attributable to the Government. There was a mutual lack
of trust between the Government and the NGOs (which were critical of the Government‟s approaches to
land governance issues) that made the contractual arrangements foreseen in the project‟s design
impossible to reach in practice The project was ready for implementation, the arrangements for
implementation and the capacity of the staff were adequate, and key staff members were appointed in a
timely manner.

5.2.2   Issues that arose during implementation were not always resolved in a timely manner.

5.2.3 Communications on fiduciary issues were not always handled in a satisfactory manner, including
the instances of misprocurement that led to the suspension of disbursements following the findings of
fraud and corruption (described above in Section 2.4). In addition, the whole issue of involuntary
resettlement and environmental degradation created by the lease of the BKL area by the MPP for private
sector development remains unresolved at the time of submission of this ICR.

5.2.4 Financial management is rated as “unsatisfactory? overall, mainly because of the still-pending
issue of the second special audit on the incentive payments scheme for LRTs. The selection and hiring of
an acceptable audit firm was not concluded before the Closing Date of the Credit, and despite the Bank‟s

                                                    27
communication with the Government reiterating that it needed to deal with the issue no formal response
has been received to-date. As a result, the amount of ineligible expenditures that may be associated with
the shortfall of the PBFA Scheme (between the advances given to LRTs and the actual titles produced)
cannot be quantified. The PBFAs functioned from the beginning of implementation to provide fixed and
variable allowances to the LRTs as an incentive to productivity in preparing and issuing titles. It became
apparent early on that over-payments were being made. A first special audit was carried out in mid-2007;
the approximate net over-payment was recovered, but the actual over-payment could not be accurately
determined. The recommendations of the audit were used to develop a new scheme – the PBIS – to be
applied in new Adjudication Areas beginning in January 2009. As a condition of extending the Closing
Date of the Credit, the Bank stipulated that an independent auditor should be contracted, not later than
May 31, 2008, to carry out an annual audit of the performance-base incentives (i.e., both PBFA and
PBIS); this was delayed multiple times and was not implemented before the Closing Date of the Credit on
December 31, 2009.

5.2.5 Subsequent to the Credit‟s Closing Date of December 31, 2009, the Government agreed in a letter
dated April 6, 2010 to provide US$140,000 from the national budget to finance this second technical
special audit and the technical audit is now underway.

5.2.6 Counterpart funding (contributed at 10 per cent towards the costs of civil works and 50 per cent
towards Incremental Operating costs after FY 2005, as specified in the DCA) was satisfactory, and there
were no issues in shortfalls in co-financing encountered during the project implementation period.

5.2.7 Governance was an issue, particularly: (a) at the sub-national levels where decisions were taken
about the precise areas to be defined as the Adjudication Areas for the purposes of land titling and
registration; and (b) in the numerous cases outside Phnom Penh (i.e., in addition to the problems of the
BKL area) where evictions and threats of eviction apparently involve Adjudication Areas under the
project.

5.2.8 Compliance with the legal covenants of the DCA was only partial; the status of compliance is
described in Annex 13. It is of particular importance to note that the project was not in compliance with
the safeguards covenants.

5.2.9 The M&E arrangements were not adequate, and the results generated could not be said to have
been used in decision-making and resource allocation. The relationships and coordination with donors
were generally good.

5.2.10 The sudden closure of the project precluded any formal discussion on arrangements for the
transition of project activities to regular operations after the closing of the Credit, however, the
Government and other Donors (Germany, Finland, and Canada) have continued to support land policy
development and systematic land titling under LASSP.

Implementing Agency Performance

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.11 The MLMUPC implemented the project through the PMO. The SLC continued to function well
throughout the life of the project. The Performance of the PMO met and exceeded expectations in respect
of organization and supervision of the Land Registration Teams and the development of capacity through
both formal and informal training programs. The efficient deployment of staff and good human resource
management allowed the Project to produce land titles at a cost well below initial expectations. However,


                                                   28
concerns about transparency and accountability were evident from an early stage. The PMO undertook to
address the identified weaknesses by implementing an agreed set of actions described in detail in the
LMAP Good Governance Framework (GGF). GGF implementation by the PMO has been rated
satisfactory. The PMO was unable to contract NGO services to support Public Awareness and
Community Participation (PACP) and to provide Legal Aid, and this failure contributed to serious
problems that emerged in the BKL area and elsewhere. The PMO also made insufficient use of the
Cadastral Database that could have provided frequent updates and maps of titling progress and helped to
identify both “best practices? and those lagging areas needing greater management attention.

5.2.12 The CLP performed well in areas of policy development. With support from GTZ- and IDA-
financed TA, the legal and policy framework was developed in several key areas during LMAP
implementation. The CLP‟s efforts to facilitate inter-ministerial dialogue and cooperation on issues
related to State land management was more problematic and contributed to the underperformance of the
Land Management component.

5.2.13 CCs were responsible for the review and resolution of land disputes both within and outside of
active titling areas. CCs were generally able to resolve simple cases involving a small number of land
claimants, although in some jurisdictions a backlog developed that caused serious delays. Unfortunately,
the CC mechanism was seldom able to resolve larger multi-party cases such as the BKL case and these
failures came to dominate public perceptions concerning the CCs and the whole subject of dispute
resolution.

5.2.14 The Administrative Commissions created to guide the Systematic Land Titling process in each
declared Adjudication Area performed well overall, as indicated by the relatively large number of titles
issued and the high levels of satisfaction expressed by title recipients in Beneficiary Assessments.
However, there is concern that land disputes in systematic titling areas were not always referred through
the resolution process as anticipated in the project design.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

 Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.15 The overall performance of the Borrower is considered to have been “moderately unsatisfactory?
in that there were significant shortcomings on the part of both the Government and the implementing
agency.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1 A number of lessons can be drawn from the implementation and achievements of the project.
They would be important to any future Bank involvement in Cambodia and have broad relevance for land
administration projects in general, particularly those in high-risk environments.

        1.       More structured risk analysis and management. The focus on a single set of risks can
        contribute to blind spots. The project experienced acute fiduciary problems leading to a
        temporary suspension of disbursements from the Credit. Addressing these problems occupied the
        attention of the Task Team and Management for an extended period at the expense of other risks.
        A more structured approach to risk management (now available through the Operational Risk
        Assessment Framework), notably during implementation, is critical to keep a broader perspective
        (e.g., with regard to the political economy environment). The assessment of risks should draw a
        distinction between true (quantifiable) risks and (unquantifiable) uncertainties. A more candid

                                                   29
analysis of the political economy environment in which the project was to operate would have
brought the risks into sharper focus, and could perhaps have helped to identify a more robust set
of risk-mitigating measures.

2.       Importance of thorough supervision and timely reporting. Supervision of the entire
project is essential, to avoid a situation in which lagging components or sub-components
eventually remain partially or even wholly unimplemented. An accurate record of project
supervision should be kept through the preparation of ISRs, and the ISR should be carefully
written and edited to avoid ambiguity. The inclusion of management comments is essential and
there should have been extensive inputs from Management before and after supervision missions
to avoid blind spots. Proactive management could have helped to address implementation issues
as they arose and to seize the opportunity to restructure the project at the MTR (2004), at the
lifting of the suspension of disbursements (February 2007) or at the extension of the Closing Date
of the Credit (December 2007).

3.      Multiple sources of information are required to inform project management.
Because of the late establishment of the M&E system and its focus on land titling, the Bank and
the Government had very little “real-time? information on what was happening on the ground.
The project needed an on-line management information system (including regularly updated
maps), an accompanying socio-economic research agenda to examine impact (given the complex
KPIs), and a continuing process of communication with Civil Society Organizations.

4.       The Results Framework and the M&E system go hand-in-hand. The objectives
should be kept as simple as possible and should avoid including vaguely-specified impacts and
outcomes whose achievement requires the satisfaction of conditions outside the project‟s control.
Broadly-defined outcome indicators are difficult (if not impossible) to measure and show that the
operational aspects of M&E had not been sufficiently thought through at the design stage. For a
Results Framework to be credible, it is essential to have the core elements of an M&E system
established before project implementation commences, including having all base-line data
prepared.

5.      Safeguards requirements should be clear and supported by an explicit supervision
plan. The LMAP safeguards instruments needed to be clearer in terms of their applicability, and
should have provided a more specific definition of the roles and responsibilities of key actors,
including Management, the client, project-affected people and civil society. The use of
safeguards frameworks (e.g., the Environmental Management Framework, the RPF and the
Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework entails ensuring that counterparts have adequate
capacity to screen sub-projects as well as to prepare the safeguards instruments when required
during project implementation. In addition, a comprehensive and detailed safeguards supervision
plan for the project should have been prepared during appraisal, commensurate with the potential
risks and the nature of the investment.

6.       Reliance on parallel programs is an important risk factor. The LMAP design relied
on a separate, donor-funded Informal Settlements Program to be implemented in parallel to
ensure that the poorest and most tenure-insecure communities would benefit from titling. This
parallel program covered Phnom Penh alone and no comparable arrangements were included
under LMAP to address similar issues elsewhere. This introduced an unidentified risk and should
have been accompanied by a detailed plan for coordination between the two programs in Phnom
Penh and plans to develop a similar arrangement for State lands elsewhere.



                                           30
       7.       Sequencing of operations in complex land projects is of vital importance. Careful
       consideration must be given to the relative sequencing and merits of: (a) proceeding with a land
       titling project (focusing exclusively in areas where the level of disputes is relatively low); (b)
       developing a program for upgrading informal settlements before moving forward with large-scale
       land titling (especially under circumstances where land disputes are common); or (c) having
       parallel operations that attempt to accomplish both goals simultaneously. Dispute resolution
       without recourse to urban housing development and livelihoods support was an inadequate
       solution in the case of LMAP.

       8.       Specific implementation arrangements need to be carefully assessed. The project‟s
       design called for NGOs to play an advocacy role (in raising public awareness, bringing disputes
       to the fore and providing legal assistance to the poor), but it was unrealistic to expect that the
       Government and NGOs would be able to engage in formal contracts. This requirement, with
       hindsight, could have been handled via a Bank-executed Trust Fund, as has been done in more
       recent land and natural resource sector projects in Cambodia (e.g., LASED).

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


Component 1: The Development of Land Policy and Regulatory Framework (PAD estimate US$2.80
million, actual cost US$2.58 million). The component as designed contained four sub-components.

Sub-component A.       The Development of the Capacity of the Secretariat of the Council of Land
Policy.

The GSCLP has continued the multi-stakeholder consultations on the Land Policy Paper. The GSCLP is
well established and is able to facilitate consultations on land policy issues among stakeholders. It has
been the beneficiary of training and involvement in international seminars, and has been provided with
basic office equipment, and TA supported by CIDA trust funds. The main challenge is to obtain the
commitment and “buy-in? of other ministries to address cross-cutting issues (e.g., state land demarcation,
land taxation, indigenous peoples communal land titling). The development of the LMSSP is designed to
provide a platform for inter-ministerial coordination on state land issues, but it will be a difficult
challenge to achieve the inter-ministerial coordination and unity of purpose required for success..

Using policy to drive change in the practice of land management and administration remained a challenge
throughout the life of the project. Key issues such as State land management and economic land
concessions were the subject of regulations that have remained significantly unimplemented. This
reflects a general governance environment in which the law does not represent the dominant form of
authority.

Sub-component B. The Formulation of Key Policies for Land Management, Administration and
Distribution Based on Studies and Pilots.

The CLP has prepared or is preparing the following policy documents:
    Strategy Framework for Land Policy (September 2002)
    Policy on Social Land Concessions (2003)
    Policy on State Land Management (2004)
    Policy on Economic Land Concessions (2005)
    Policy on the Development of Indigenous Communities;
    Policy on the Registration and Right to Use of Land of Indigenous Communities in Cambodia.
      This was followed by a Sub-decree on Procedures for the Registration of Land of Indigenous
      Communities (2009); to date, no indigenous land has been registered although there is a pipe-line
      of applications pending.
    White Paper on Land Policy (draft December 2009)
    Declaration on Land Policy (draft pending approval)
    Spatial Planning Policy (preliminary draft)
    Housing Policy (under revision; first draft supported by UN Habitat)
    Policy on Land Valuation (under development).

Sub-component C. The Development and Drafting of Legal Instruments.

The 2001 Land Law has been followed by nine Sub-decrees and other regulatory instruments (letters,
proclamations and circulars). Superficially, this body of material presents a scenario of “reasonable
policy and regulations but poor implementation?. More realistically, this goes to the heart of the issue of
governance and it can be argued that it represents a de jure “policy apparatus? that is not, de facto, the
policy of the Government.

                                                    35
Sub-component D. The Dissemination of Policies, Laws, Rules and Regulations.

Dissemination of the 2001 Land Law was supported by the project‟s PACP though the project was not
successful in contracting this work out to NGOs as anticipated in the project design.

Component 2: Institutional Development (US$6.40 million, actual cost US$8.73 million).                 The
component as designed contained four sub-components.

Sub-component A. The Long-Term Institutional Development of the MLMUPC.

Several training courses, including overseas training, have been carried out. CIDA Trust Fund resources
for tuition reimbursement has been approved but not yet activated.

Sub-component B. Project Management.

Project management activities are satisfactorily carried out by the MLMUPC‟s Technical Audit,
Monitoring and Evaluation, Public Relations, Procurement, and Finance and Administration Units and the
Internal Auditor.

Sub-component C.        The Development of a Land Management and Administration Education
Program.

This was successfully achieved through the establishment of a degree course in Land Management and
Administration at the Royal University of Agriculture.

Sub-component D. The Development of a Private Land Surveying Industry.

The development of a private land surveying industry was not implemented.


Component 3: A Land Titling Program and Development of a Land Registration System (US$20.40
million, actual cost US$22.31 million). The component as designed contained four sub-components.

Sub-component A. Information Dissemination and Community Participation.

PACP activities are carried out by the Land Registration Teams as part of the land titling process. The
procurement of NGO support for PACP activities was not achieved.

Sub-component B. A Systematic Land Titling Program.

By December 2007, the PAD targets of one million surveyed and adjudicated parcels, 800,000 signed
titles and 760,000 titles distributed to beneficiaries were surpassed. The revised targets established
following the extension of the Closing Date of the Credit were also achieved. The actual cost per title, as
of December 2007, was only one-third of the cost estimated at appraisal (US$11 cf. US$30).

Geodetic grid, base mapping, and training.




                                                    36
Sub-component C. A Sporadic Land Titling Program.

An improved legal framework for sporadic titling was elaborated in a 2002 sub-decree. However,
procedures for implementing this new framework were only put in place for areas that had a cadastral
index map (ie areas that had been through the systematic titling process already). As such the aim of this
subcomponent as stated in the PAD (supporting “the issuance of titles (first-time issuance and
registration of land titles) on demand in the project provinces?) was only supported in a limited manner.
Most sporadic titling continues outside the framework of the new sub-decree using processes that are non-
transparent and subject to heavy informal payments.

Sub-component D. The Development of a Modern Land Registration System.

The land registration system and operational procedures have been established. Improved office facilities,
with equipment, furniture and materials, have been provided. The land registration database system has
been established.

Component 4: The Strengthening of Mechanisms for Dispute Resolution (US$1.70 million, actual
cost US$2.52 million). The component as designed had three sub-components.

Sub-component A. The Strengthening of the National Cadastral Commission.

The National Cadastral Commission (NCC) was created under the 2001 Land Law and began to function
in December 2002. Its Secretariat (NCCS) reported in December 2008 that nationwide the cadastral
commissions had received 5,038 cases of which1,653 had been resolved, 1,433 dismissed or withdrawn,
and 1,952 were pending.

Responding to this backlog of cases in the CC system the government has subsequently introduced
„mobile teams‟ in high workload districts and delegated the NCC‟s adjudicative power to the provincial
level. An assessment of the impact of these reforms was not available at the time of writing.

Sub-component B. The Strengthening of the Cadastral Commissions at the Provincial and District
Levels.

Provincial-level CCs are functioning in all Project Provinces.

A number of studies on the CCs were conducted under the project. These found that the CCs were
effective in resolving by agreement many of the (mainly small) disputes that were filed with them. On
the other hand, it became clear that: (a) the CCs were generally not resolving larger, more complex
disputes, particularly those involving powerful parties; (b) the decision making power (as opposed to is
mediation function) of the CCs was underdeveloped; (c) there were major backlogs of cases from the
systematic titling process that were not reaching the cadastral commission as intended by the law; and (d)
the main forums for land dispute resolution remained with the mainstream of the Executive.

Sub-component C. Legal Assistance for the Disadvantaged.

The sub-component was not fully implemented. Two Legal Aid pilots were implemented with GTZ
support. The first was carried out between 2003-2004 in Kompong Speu Province using the NGOs Legal
Aid Cambodia and the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC). The envisaged
IDA funded contract with an NGO to support legal assistance for the disadvantaged under the project
stalled in procurement.


                                                    37
Component 5: Land Management (US$2.60 million, actual cost US$1.88 million). The component had
three sub-components.

The Government and the Bank agreed in early 2009 that the policy framework needs to be more fully
developed to facilitate the implementation of land management activities. Under the GSCLP, the
Government initiated the preparation of a special planning policy and a land valuation policy. In the
absence of an agreed LMSSP, the project is no longer expected to produce many of the outputs planned
for this component. The development of “district strategic plans? was piloted in five districts before the
introduction of LASSP. In early 2009, it was anticipated that Land Use Planning would continue after the
adoption of the spatial planning policy and the legal framework. The legal framework for land
management was reviewed. Only a few state properties have been sporadically registered following
ministerial requests. Other properties, mainly schools, health centers and other local government
buildings were registered as part of the systematic titling process.

Sub-component A. The Clarification of Procedures for Land Classification.

The land classification policy was approved by the CLP and the guidelines were prepared. The Policy
Document of State land Management was prepared (2004) and the State land Sub-Decree #118 was
signed (October 2005).

Sub-component B. The Procurement of Aerial Photography and Satellite Imagery.

The acquisition of aerial photography and the production of orthophoto maps were achieved through
contracts with international companies (Blominfo of Denmark and FINNMAP of Finland).

Sub-component C. The Preparation of Land Classification Maps at the Provincial Level.

Some work was done with GTZ support in the Department of Land Use Planning in the General
Department of Cadastre and Geography. However, no land classification maps of project provinces were
ultimately prepared.

Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

A. Project benefits and expected returns at appraisal

1.       At appraisal, the main benefits of the project were expected to be:
(a) improved land tenure security through the provision of approximately one million land titles, which
would reduce the risks of land grabbing, encroachment, land disputes and expropriation. The lack of
tenure security was also believed to contribute greatly to poverty in Cambodia.
(b) increased investment, both domestic and international, as a result of better access to credit and the
establishment of a more secure, stable and predictable investment climate.
(c) greater efficiency of land use via the formation of land markets in rural areas and improvements in the
functioning of land markets in urban areas.
(d) improved tax collection and land-use planning based on the information generated from an improved
land registry and cadastre system and the titling process.
(e) improved natural resources management by private operators taking a long-term view and investing
in measures such as soil conservation and sustainable forest management.

2.      However, these benefits were expected to be fully realized only over the long term, and their
achievement during the life of the project was considered “… not likely to be evident?, for two main
reasons:

(a) most of the titles distributed under the project were expected to be issued during project years three
and four, which would not provide enough time for benefits to be measurable; and
(b) the macroeconomic environment and the development of relevant institutions would also influence
investor behavior. If the macroeconomic environment were to be unstable or if formal banking
institutions failed to emerge in rural areas, the expected levels of investment might not materialize.

3.      On economic and financial analysis, the PAD is limited to providing estimates of the fiscal
impact of the project, and with respect to the financial impact on landholders and the overall economic
costs and benefits of the project the PAD is limited to a description of some of the theoretical impacts of
the project and to plans for quantitative analysis during implementation.

Financial analysis

4.       The financial analysis from the perspective of landholders described two main theoretical
incentives for landholders to obtain a title (improved security of land ownership and improved access to
credit). With respect to the fees to be charged to title recipients, the PAD mentions that “Discussions with
farmers and government officials and other anecdotal evidence indicate that the fee arrangement would
be reasonable.? but does not estimate what type of registration fee level would be appropriate or, at the
proposed fee level, what would be the financial returns for landholders. The PAD states that a study of
the fee structure and levels of land-related taxes would be undertaken as a pre-implementation activity in
order to inform decisions on fee arrangements. This study was not done, and there is no detailed data
available for financial analysis from the perspective of landholders.

5.       Most land titling projects include systematic adjudication to title all parcels in a given area. To
ensure a high level of voluntary participation by landholders, the charge to them for titling is kept at a
level significantly lower than the cost. The ability of the poorest landholders to be able to participate is
one of major criteria for setting an appropriate level registration fee. For example, at the time of
appraisal, in Thailand landholders were charged less than US$5 per title compared to the average cost of

                                                    39
US$36 per title. In Indonesia, landholders were charged about US$2 per title while the average cost was
around US$26. To implement the project, the Government and IDA agreed that a similar arrangement
would be introduced in Cambodia. Appraisal estimates indicated that the expected cost to produce a title
and maintain it over a ten-year period would be US$38.10. Fees of US$2-5 and US$15-25 per title were
to be charged to landholders in rural and urban areas, respectively. Discussions with farmers and
Government officials and other anecdotal evidence indicated that the fee arrangement was reasonable
(and far less than the bribes needed at that time - said to be between US$200 and US$500 - for a sporadic
title for an average rural plot). This expected to strengthen the demand for the project‟s services, and the
affordability of the poorest was taken into account. Therefore, the cost recovery arrangement of the
project was expected to have a positive impact on the distribution of project benefits.

Fiscal impact

6.        The analysis of the expected fiscal impact at appraisal calculated a 22 per cent FRR and a NPV of
US$15.4 million (at a 10 per cent discount rate). The analysis was based on the distribution of 1.1 million
titles, a 30 year period, project costs, and benefits from: (a) registration fees; (b) subsequent transaction
registration fees; and (c) transfer tax revenues (at 4 per cent of land value). The main driver of the
evaluation was the transfer tax revenue stream, which accounts for 66 per cent of the NPV of all fiscal
revenues estimated. Surprisingly, the costs used in the fiscal impact analysis do not seem to have been
adjusted for taxes and they are somewhat higher than the project‟s financial costs including contingencies
reported elsewhere in the PAD.

Economic analysis

7.       The approach described for economic analysis in the PAD follows the one for financial analysis
from a landholder‟s perspective. The PAD lists the main expected benefits from the project and describes
a proposed methodology to calculate NPV and ERR. The main benefits in urban areas would be
measured through “... land price changes due to titling while holding other factors constant? and in rural
areas benefits would be quantified as the “... incremental increase in production and associated income
from titling, subtracting the value of the investment inputs?.

8.       While the theoretical approach proposed is in line with most of the literature on the impact of
land titling, at appraisal it was concluded that it was not possible to provide quantitative estimates of
project benefits and compute an NPV or an ERR for the project as a whole for several reasons: (a)
information on how farmers and urban dwellers might respond to the provision of titles was not available,
and there were difficulties in extrapolating from experiences in neighboring countries; (b) pilot projects
supported by the Governments of Germany and Finland had not yet generated information on the
response of title holders; and (c) the project was designed as the first phase of a 15 year program with half
of project costs targeting institutional development (which, the PAD argued, was “… not subject to
economic analysis.?). The latter argument is slightly confusing given that the PAD then proposes a plan
for an ex post evaluation of the project (in line with what was done in Thailand and Indonesia) that would
be used to “justify possible follow-on projects? of this long-term Program. With the benefit of hindsight,
this is far too short a period in which to complete the work. Thailand‟s land titling program is still a
work-in-progress after close to 30 years.

9.      The PAD annex on economic analysis also mentioned plans for an ex post quantitative economic
analysis to be carried out with data from the proposed socio-economic surveys (panel data using control
and treatment groups). The base-line surveys for rural areas (July 2004) and urban areas (August 2007)
were completed, but because of problems during implementation these socio-economic surveys never
took place.


                                                     40
B. The approach to financial and economic analysis at ICR

10.      The ICR mission faced significant difficulties that restricted the ability to conduct a standard
economic and financial analysis:
(a) key studies included in the project‟s design to gather data for financial and economic analysis have not
been conducted.
(b) the mission could not access key information from the project and the Government necessary for the
calculations, including detailed data on costs (in particular, to assess the cost of titles), on tax revenues
(registration, transaction fees and others), on the quantity of titles issued each year by type (there are five
types) under systematic titling, on the timing of systematic titling implementation and on the number of
titles in the cadastre being used as collateral for loans with financial institutions. In addition, the ICR
team did not have access to the detailed calculations for the fiscal impact analysis carried out at appraisal.
(c) contact with the project implementation team was limited and it was not possible to make field visits
to interview direct beneficiaries (landholders) or other key stakeholders (e.g., titling team members). The
ICR team was able to hold additional meetings with stakeholders involved in titling, including donors and
NGOs, and with financial institutions.

11.      As a result of these limitations, the ex post economic and financial analysis prepared for this ICR
focuses on:
(a) a review of project documentation, literature and studies that: (i) started with a summary of the
theoretical impact of the project; and (ii) reviewed information from sources such as the project base-line
and BA studies, the 2007 UNDP report on Land and Human Development, work by Thomas Markussen
(2008), and interviews with NGOs, financial institutions and project stakeholders.
(b) a revision of key assumptions from the PAD, in order to re-estimate the fiscal impact of the project.
(c) using assumptions derived from interviews and data provided during the ICR mission, a calculation of
the economic and financial returns of the project.

C. Empirical evidence on the economic impact of the project

12.     The literature on the economics of land titling is extensive (see for example Besley and Ghatak,
Chapter 68 “Property Rights and Economic Development? in the Handbook of Development Economics
Volume 5 (2010), edited by Dan Rodrik and Mark Rozenzweig, and Besley, “Property Rights and
Investment Incentives: Theory and Evidence from Ghana?, Journal of Political Economy, 1995). As
suggested by Besley and Ghatak, the main channels through which property rights have an impact on the
efficiency of resource allocation are:
(a) by limiting expropriation: this includes two main categories: (i) enhancing investment through a lower
risk of expropriation; and (ii) reducing the need to divert private resources to protect property.
(b) by facilitating market transactions: this includes two main categories: (i) facilitating trade in assets
(such as land); and (ii) improving the ability to collateralize assets, thereby facilitating credit transactions.

13.      As stated in the PAD, these channels drive the benefits expected from the project. The annex on
economic analysis included in the PAD lists five main benefits from the project, which include these
theoretical channels albeit in a less structured form (some of the channels are repeated in different ways in
the identified benefits). The empirical literature draws a mixed picture of the economic impact of tenure
security depending on the context (such as the type of property rights provided, the institutional
environment and the quality of informal arrangements). In addition, the literature highlights some of the
key challenges in conducting empirical research on the impact of titling. In addition, Cambodia has
registered high economic growth rates (and also growth in rice productivity) in the period of the project‟s
implementation that makes the attribution of effects to titling more difficult to establish.
                                                       41
14.      It was planned at appraisal to have a detailed economic evaluation of the project based on a study
to be carried out during implementation (in practice, the study never went beyond the base-line data
stage). The approach proposed was in line with the lack of detail and targets on most of the outcome
indicators of the project shown in the PAD. For example, the PAD proposed the use of the indicator
“agricultural productivity rises? to capture some of the theoretically-expected economic benefits, but
there is no detail on what crops, how much increase is expected and relative to what initial level or group
of people, among others. There have been a number of empirical studies with different approaches that
can provide some idea of the impact of titling in Cambodia.

15.      One of the main studies is by Thomas Markussen, which uses instrumental variables (IV)
estimation to conclude that plots held with documentation are on average 30-35 per cent more productive
than those without (see Thomas Markussen, “Property Rights, Productivity and Common Property
Resources: Insights from Rural Cambodia?, World Development 2008). Markussen underlines the
fact that the order of magnitude is quite high, especially compared to the effects of irrigation or education.
He also concludes that improved property rights have a positive, but insignificant, impact on access to
credit (households with documentation for all their land pay half a per centage point lower monthly
interest than households with no land documentation). Markussen also found that there was no effect on
land rental market activity. While the study is interesting and follows some of the literature on linking
land productivity to secure tenure, it has to be used with caution for several reasons. First, the data used
by Markussen is from the 2004 Cambodia Socio-Economic Survey (CSES), a nationally representative
survey that was carried out by the National Institute of Statistics during the period November 2003 –
January 2005, which means that the titles delivered by the project were not captured in the data. Second,
the definition of “land papers? (documentation) is based both on “legal certificates? (which had been
issued already at the time, but were very few in number) and “application receipts? (these merely confirm
that someone has made a request for a certificate and were also issued during the early 1990s). The
reason for this is that certificates were often confused with application receipts when administering the
survey (Markussen 2007). Markussen discusses such issues based on findings from qualitative work
conducted in 2006-2007 (59 semi-structured interviews covering six provinces and Phnom Penh,
including both villages covered and not covered by the LMAP). See “Land Titling in Cambodia –
findings from a field trip?, second draft, March 2007. Third, the instrument chosen (Markussen uses mode
of acquiring a plot as an instrument for property rights) can also be subject to criticism, namely that the
instrument may also have a direct impact on productivity, not only through property rights. However,
Markussen‟s research suggests that, around ten years following the issuance of application receipts and
some certificates, such a mix of “soft? and “hard? titles implied strong effects on agricultural productivity
compared with not having any of them.

16.     Two BAs were carried out (by GTZ) during the implementation of the project (in 2006 and 2009)
with the main purpose of gauging overall beneficiary satisfaction with the land titling process and their
use of land titles in areas covered by the project. The studies used a mixed methods approach to gauge
perceptions and satisfaction levels and to provide recommendations on how to improve the titling
processes put in place by the project. The first BA covered 12 randomly-selected sites in nine provinces
and Phnom Penh for a total of 309 interviews. The assessment concluded that the large majority of
beneficiaries were satisfied with the land titles received and that the adjudication process had met or
exceeded the expectations of the majority of respondents. Some further conclusions were that:
(a) beneficiaries stated that the registration fee levels were acceptable.
(b) nearly half of respondents claimed access to credit as the key benefit from titling, although only
around 19 per cent of respondents actually had loans.
The study also suggested that the effects on credit access in the short term are limited and that the longer
the time period elapsed since obtaining the titles the greater the number of landowners accessing credit

                                                     42
though it must be noted that the BA methodology does not support the establishment of a causal link
between titling and increased access to credit.

17.      Similarly, the second BA conducted in 2009 (involving ten randomly-selected sites, for a total of
485 beneficiaries interviewed, and separate focus group discussions for men and women covering 114
landowners) reinforced the findings of the first BA.
(a) there was general satisfaction with the process of titling and the registration fees.
(b) improved access to credit followed by reduced conflict over land were seen as the main benefits from
titling. Interviews with four banks and MFIs indicated that the possession of a land title is generally not a
major consideration for smaller loans, but often speeds up the process of loan approval and helps to
qualify borrowers for larger loans. In addition, representatives of institutions also mentioned that the
increase of official land titles made it easier for them to avoid over-lapping loans being secured by the
same property. These findings were in line with interviews held by the ICR team with MFI and bank
officials in Cambodia.

(c) registration of subsequent land transactions is not really taking place, given the perception that it is an
expensive and difficult process that lacks transparency.

18.      The 2007 UNDP study Land and Human Development in Cambodia uses a logistic regression to
suggest that household poverty risk is reduced with increased access to land and, in particular, when the
land is secured by a title. The study goes further in using such estimates for the simulation of land reform
scenarios (including the titling all households plots). The study surprisingly presents the conclusions of
the simulations for use in policy discussion, despite the multiple problems that can arise with such an
empirical methodology. As an example, the study‟s simulation concludes that providing a title to all the
poor households would reduce the incidence of poverty from 31 to 23 per cent. Still, the main estimation
using the logistic regression (household poverty dummy is the dependent variable) shows a coefficient
value for holding a title that is around half that of other variables (such as fertilizer use or agricultural
mechanization). The results are based on the CSES 2004 which does not cover project-issued titles and
includes some problems of ambiguity in the questionnaire. Finally, the study may suffer from regression
specification problems, which do not seem to have been dealt with in sufficient detail. For example, there
can be reverse causality issues in regressing a poverty dummy with holding a title as richer people may be
the ones that more easily are able to lobby to obtain a certificate.

19.     There is no single study that can provide quantitative estimates of the economic impact of titling
under the project. This could be attempted using data from CSES 2004, 2007, 2008 and 2009 (which is
expected to be available in late-2010); the questionnaire for 2009 is more detailed on the land section (it is
more specific on the question of having a certificate versus a receipt or other document). It also includes
questions about showing the document that the landowner has for the plot and also on which year the
landowner started using the plot or first owned it. There may still be problems with the data but it is
possible that productivity levels could be differentiated between certificates and other types of claims as
well as no type of title at all. A first analysis could therefore attempt to build on the instrumental
variables strategy used in Markussen (2008).

20.      This data could be combined with project data about areas that have benefited from systematic
titling and the timing of coverage under the project, and used in combination with household CSES data
to build artificial control and treatment groups through propensity score matching. Control and treatment
groups could then be compared before and after the intervention. There may be some selection bias in the
targeting of areas for titling under the project (the project focused initially on those areas with less
conflict) and therefore the fact could be used that in the 2009 dataset some areas have benefited from the


                                                      43
project only after the data has been collected. Similarly, such a pipeline approach could also be attempted
using data from the smaller samples (2007 and 2008).

21.      On the impact of titling on credit, further research could be based on the cadastre data and, in
particular, using information about the number of outstanding loans that have been notified to the cadastre
by the banks (in order to avoid over-lapping claims). This could shed light on the importance of the
titling system for the development of the financial sector.

D. Financial benefits and returns from the landholder’s perspective

22.      The analysis of benefits and returns from the landholder‟s perspective focuses on the expected
positive impact of holding a title on access to loans used for productive investments. In the absence of
further data, the ICR team identified improved access to credit as the main direct benefit of the project for
landholders. This is only one of the possible channels through which titling impacts the efficiency of
resource allocation, and it is possible that other channels could be relevant to the Cambodian situation
(such as reducing the risk of expropriation and facilitating trade in land). However, it was not possible to
quantify these impacts, given the information available, and the analysis is therefore based on comparing
the stream of financial benefits from access to credit with the costs associated with the registration
procedures.

23.     For a loan between US$10,000 - 20,000, better terms of credit can be obtained in Cambodia by
providing a land title as collateral. For an average loan of US$15,000 belonging to the small-sized loans
category, an annual saving of US$360 can be obtained due to the lower interest rates applied by most
lending institutions. An average discount of 0.2 per cent per month can be obtained by presenting a
formal title as compared to having only a “soft? title. Comparing this figure with the titling costs to be
paid by the beneficiary (between US$2.5 and US$50 in rural areas and between US$75 and US$250 in
urban areas), the net benefits are substantial. There are also benefits from having a title in terms of: (a)
the speed of processing the loan; and (b) the terms of the loan (for example, a longer duration of the loan
by around a third and also being eligible for larger loans).

        Figure 1: ACLEDA Bank PLC: Number of loans by loan size




        Source: ACLEDA Bank
        Note: Micro <US$10,000    Small US$10,000 – 20,000    Medium >US$20,000

                                                     44
24.      In addition to the reduction in interest rates, landholders presenting a title as collateral are eligible
to obtain loans which are larger than US$20,000 (the level depends on the institution; smaller MFIs
indicate that the threshold for demanding a formal title could be as low as US$10,000). These loans could
not otherwise be obtained, at least according to the formal requirements of lending institutions. It is
sensible, however, to assume that in the context of Cambodia a share of medium- and large-sized loans
can be disbursed by formal lending institutions without the collateralization instrument being formally
required (i.e., through other informal arrangements). As can be seen in Figure 1, medium-sized loans have
registered a very strong increase during the period of the project‟s implementation (at least for ACLEDA
Bank, which in 2010 is the largest bank in Cambodia in terms of credit volume). While the number of
micro- and small loans doubled from 2004 to 2009, the number of medium-sized loans has increased
more than ten times. However, there are numerous factors in play (such as strong growth in the economy
and in the property market) and therefore it is not clear what has been the contribution of titling under the
project to the development of the credit market.

25.      As loans could not be obtained otherwise, the incentive to have a title is even greater for those
intending to access loans greater than US$20,000 (i.e., medium- and large-sized loans). The financial
impact on the beneficiary in this case can be evaluated as the monetary value of the benefits from having
access to loans (minus the cost of titling for the landholder) compared to a situation of exclusion. There
are several approaches to evaluate such incremental benefits that are linked to the ability to make bigger
investments and also not to miss potentially profitable investment opportunities. For this analysis, the
assumption is that the loan would be re-invested for productive activities and would yield a return above
the cost of capital (estimated at the interest rate paid). Assuming a 5 per cent annual return above the cost
of capital, the net financial benefit for an average beneficiary who is able to access medium-sized loans
through a title is around US$1,000 per year, compared to the modest payment needed to obtain the land
title.

26.     As assumed in the PAD (although no calculations were provided at that stage), the financial
impact on beneficiaries from access to medium-sized loans and improved credit terms on small loans is
positive at the ICR stage even applying the above-mentioned conservative assumptions as an illustration.
This confirms the views of other research about landowners‟ perceptions on the registration fees paid.
With micro- and small loans (those between a few hundred and US$10.000, and likely to be within the
means of the majority of the population) there is a lack of evidence of any quantitative benefit for
beneficiaries from titling (at least in terms of access to credit). The latter seem also to be the majority of
the beneficiaries of loans. Taking the ACLEDA Bank portfolio as an example, small and micro loans
account for around 90 per cent of all loans provided in 2009 (in number terms) but just 34 per cent in
terms of US$ value of credit provided by the institution.While there may be other benefits linked to
productivity (through channels such as lower expropriation risk) these have yet to be quantified through
empirical research. As such, on the current state of knowledge LMAP titling can only be demonstrated to
have had a quantifiable economic benefit for the rich. It is not possible to assert with any confidence a
pro-poor economic benefit from the project.

E. Fiscal impact analysis at ICR

Methodology and assumptions

27.      The analysis uses the same principles as the one conducted at appraisal while trying to update
information on costs and benefits. The ICR evaluation covers not only the seven-year period in which the
project was under implementation but extends its assumptions over a longer period to capture the overall
fiscal impact of the project (given that the Government has continued titling activities following the
project‟s closure). Following discussions with Government, it is estimated that the nearly 6 million land


                                                       45
parcels that are present in Cambodia will be entirely adjudicated by 2024 and that the benefits and costs
associated with the project have been accounted for in order to estimate fiscal returns.

28.     In the short run, the fiscal impact of the proposed project was expected to be neutral, given that
less than 10 per cent of the total project cost would be financed by the Government. In the long run, it
was expected that the fiscal impact will be highly positive as shown by the NPV of around US$15.4
million (at a discount factor of 10 per cent) and the FRR of 22 per cent (PAD Annex 5 Table 1).

29.       The PAD surprisingly takes into consideration costs for the fiscal impact analysis that are higher
than the actual project costs (PAD, pages 52 and 53). There is also no mention of tax adjustments to
project costs. At ICR, the following three main adjustments have therefore been made:
(a) actual project costs for the period 2002-09 (provided by the PMO) are adjusted to 2010 constant prices
using inflation rates.
(b) a 10 per cent tax deduction from project costs was assumed as an internal transfer with no fiscal
implications (given that no detail on the tax content of project costs was available, it is based on other
projects in Cambodia).
(c) US$3.5 million in annual titling costs was assumed for the period 2010-2024 following discussions
with Government officials (expected costs for the post-project period have been estimated by the
Government to be constant, and resources have already been committed through the Ministry of Economy
and Finance for the next three-year period) and the Governments of Canada, Germany and Finland have
renewed their support to the program in terms of TA.
(d) Because of the lack of detail on the composition of costs (to understand which ones are directly related
to titling), the analysis at ICR also considers three cost scenarios:
     (i) Scenario I compares the overall project costs with the benefits from the revenue streams identified
     at appraisal. In Scenario I, the majority of costs used to calculate the net benefits were not directly
     associated with land titling activities but indirectly contributed to the creation of a favorable
     environment and building the infrastructure needed to achieve the objective of the titling program.
     (ii) Scenario II follows the same approach but only the costs of Component 3 are taken into
     consideration. In this case, some of the costs under Component 3 are not directly linked to land
     titling activities in the strict sense (e.g., costs associated with land registry).
     (iii) Scenario III takes into account only those costs under Sub-components 3.1 and 3.2 that are
     immediately related to titling activities. These costs are directly associated with information
     dissemination and community participation and with systematic land titling.

F. Financial benefits and costs for the Government

30.     Given that there is no system of annual land tax or capital gains tax in Cambodia, the expected
financial benefits of the project anticipated at appraisal were expected to come from the following
sources:
(a) Initial registration fees collected by the MLMUPC.
(b) Subsequent transaction registration fee collected by the MLMUPC.
(c) Increased revenue from the land transaction tax (4 per cent of transaction value).
(d) Possible increases in the “unused land? tax to discourage warehousing of land for speculative
purposes.
The financial costs to the Government are the direct project costs and the future management fees
associated with each title issued under the project.

31.      The main fiscal revenue sources identified in the PAD and an analysis of whether they
materialized or not are summarized in Table 1. The main assumptions used for estimating fiscal benefits
are listed in detail in Appendix 1 and include mainly the following:
(a) Number and type of titles: at appraisal, the number of titles to be issued during project implementation
was 1.1 million. However, the analysis is slightly confusing as in attachment III of the PAD the total
number of parcels to be surveyed and adjudicated is estimated at 1.0 million of which 80 per cent are
assumed to be registered by the end of the project (PAD, p.43). According to project data, 1,667,284
parcels were actually surveyed during the implementation period (2002-2009) and 1,230,675 titles were
issued (73 per cent of the total number of parcels surveyed, a slightly lower percentage than expected in
the PAD). A detailed table with a break-down of the number of titles issued annually in each target
province is provided in Appendix 2. Figure 2 shows implementation data compared to the PAD
expectations. After 2009, it is assumed that it will take approximately 15 years to adjudicate all the
remaining land parcels in Cambodia (estimated between 6 and 7 million in total). According to the
Government, this will be achieved at a rate of around 350,000 annually. At ICR, it is assumed that titling
will grow at a slightly slower rate (i.e., from around 270,000 in 2009 to 300,000 in 2010 and gradually
reaching 350,000 in 2013).
(b) Initial and subsequent registration fees: the original fee structure for initial registration was amended
by the Government during implementation and remains valid after project closure. Initial registration fees
range between US$2.5 per ha for agricultural land in rural areas and US$250 per ha for residential or


                                                          47
commercial land in Phnom Penh. Also in the case of subsequent registration, the original fee structure
was changed and approved by the Government during implementation.
(c) Transaction tax: the tax represents an important source of revenue for the Government and would be a
perennial source of income after the complete adjudication of all the land parcels in the country.
However, up to now the collection of the transaction tax (as with subsequent registration fees) has been
difficult and only a small percentage of transactions have been officially recorded. This is the result of
many factors, including the absence of a reliable land valuation system. In the second BA (2009), one of
the main issues identified is the perceived lack of transparency in land valuation, resulting in an
inconsistent application of the transaction tax (determining different levels of taxation). It is estimated
that only 10-20 per cent of the total land transactions have been recorded. An increasing trend in
subsequent registrations can be seen starting from 2008 however the implications of this trend are
uncertain.
(d) Average price per ha: one of the most challenging assumptions is related to the proxy values used for
land prices in the PAD, especially for urban areas. In a period of accelerated economic growth,
estimating land values for an extended period of time is extremely difficult. The initial PAD estimates
related to the value of land in rural areas was US$0.33 per m² (US$3,300 per ha) and US$25 per m² in
urban areas (US$250,000 per ha). The first assumption remains valid at the time of this ICR. In fact, the
average price for agricultural land in rural areas has been constant during recent years according to most
accounts. At present, average prices for agricultural land in rural areas range between US$0.1 to 1.0 per
m². In urban areas, however, the property market has boomed in the period 2002-08, especially in Phnom
Penh, with commercial and residential property reaching respectively US$3,000 and US$1,850 per m².
The value used in the PAD is hence very low in relation to market values, especially in central Phnom
Penh. For the ICR calculations, the average value used as a proxy of urban land value is around US$250
from 2006 onwards (rising gradually from US$50 in 2002). This is based on discussions with local real
estate consultancy firms and taking into account price trends and dynamics in Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville
and Siem Reap, the three major urban centers.

G. Results and average cost per title

32.     Three scenarios of fiscal impact were prepared to assess the net fiscal revenue stream derived by
the land titling program to which the project substantially contributed between 2002 and 2009. Costs and
benefits are compared for the period 2002-2024, and the NPV and IRR are calculated.

                                                                         NPV                      ERR
                                                                (US$ million @ 12 per cent      (per cent)
                                                                     discount rate)
 Scenario I   [all project costs directly and indirectly                  10.0                    16.0
               associated with land titling]
 Scenario II [Component 3 costs]                                          22.0                    26.0
 Scenario III [Sub-components 3.1 and 3.2]                                24.0                    27.9

Naturally, these results need to be taken with caution given the lack of detailed data and the consequent
assumptions that have been made. However, the results suggest that the project presents satisfactory
fiscal returns.

33.      In order to determine the fee applicable to land owners, an average cost per title was calculated at
appraisal. Based on this calculation, the Government decided to charge different fees to beneficiaries.
The social concerns of the project implied the application of fees that would be lower than the cost of
titling. In the PAD, the cost of issuing a title was estimated to be US$38, significantly higher than the
actual average cost per title as reported by Government during implementation. Apparently through
improved capacity of project management and scale economies, the average cost per title decreased
progressively between 2002 and 2009. The average cost of issuing a title under the project in the period
2002-2009 was US$16.75 per plot. In 2009, taking only the project activities directly related to titling,
the cost per title was US$11. According to the PMO, from 2010 onwards this cost should be around
US$10 per title.

34.      These figures need to be assessed with care. In fact, the average cost is simply calculated by
dividing the estimate of cost (that reportedly accounts only for the direct costs associated with issuing
titles, mainly salaries and other operating costs) by the number of titles. This is misleading, since
activities under other components contributed to the efficient implementation of Component 3. In
addition, it is not clear how the direct costs are accounted for in the first place (e.g., what is the real fiscal
burden associated with using Government staff in the provinces for titling?). The issue of measurement of
cost per title has been highlighted in numerous project supervision missions. Due to limited contact with
the LMAP PMO, it was not possible for the ICR team to obtain more details on this matter.

35.    Other project costs can be incorporated in the cost per title measurement as per the three scenarios
mentioned above. Such an analysis yields average costs per title in the 2007-09 period ranging between
US$12.4 and US$24.8. If the whole project period (2002-09) is considered, the range is between
US$16.8 and US$37.0.

H. Economic analysis

36.     The quantitative assessment of the impact of the project on landholders through the identified
channels is difficult, given the lack of data. This is particularly true for the first channel (limiting
expropriation) and its results, in terms of enhanced investment and reducing the need to divert private
resources to protect property. However, for the second channel (facilitating market transactions) it is still
possible to provide an estimate of the impact of land titling on access to credit, in line with the financial
analysis conducted.

                                                           49
37.      A direct causal relationship between areas targeted under systematic land titling and the
increasing size and number of loans in the same areas could not be established because of the lack of data.
However, as anticipated in the base-line studies, between 2002 and 2009 there was a shift in the number,
size and intended use of loans provided by different financial institutions. Discussions with financial
institutions in Cambodia suggest that this was in part due to titling (as they needed such documentation to
be able to expand lending in certain categories). In line with this, the calculations at the ICR stage
illustrate the economic impact of the project through some assumptions and sensitivity analysis.

38.      The analysis takes into consideration the project‟s economic costs, the 2002-24 time horizon and
the following two types of benefits:
(a) better terms of credit (only the lower interest rate is accounted for) for small loans between US$10,000
- 20,000. According to Cambodian financial institutions, this is about 1.4 per cent per year compared to
an annual interest rate of 22 per cent for a loan without a title as collateral. This would result in a higher
efficiency of resource allocation although it is difficult to measure the magnitude with available
information (namely on elasticities of loan demand to interest rate). Out of simplicity for the purpose of
this illustrative exercise, the assumption was to use interest payments saved due to titling as economic
benefits.
(b) the possibility of accessing medium-sized loans that can only be secured with a title as a collateral
(medium-sized loans are considered to be those that exceed US$20,000). In this case, the economic
benefit is estimated based on the returns to those loans that took place due to titling. In order to simplify,
the interest rate paid on those loans is used as a minimum return that borrowers would require by taking
those loans.

39.     The analysis of benefits takes into consideration the overall credit portfolio in the country, which
in 2009 was valued at US$2.5 billion (based on National Bank of Cambodia data). From that figure,
US$400 million is deducted to account for credit provided by MFIs which has a very low average loan
size (and therefore would in principle not have many small and medium clients) to reach US$2.1 billion.
The equivalent estimated figure for 2004 (the year in which titling started under the project) is of US$345
million. The analysis assumes that 34 per cent of the annual increase in the credit portfolio is due to
medium-sized loans and 17 per cent to small-sized loans (this is based on data for ACLEDA Bank,
adjusted to reflect the average Cambodian financial institution).

40.       By assuming that 10 per cent of the medium-sized loans portfolio growth during the period was
due to titling and also that 20 per cent of the small-sized loans benefited from lower interest rates due to
titling, the analysis suggests an economic ERR of 22 per cent and an NPV (at 12 per cent discount rate) of
US$26.5 million. This is mainly driven by the assumption on which percentage of medium-sized loans
took place because of titling (ceteris paribus). Even if the benefits on improved terms of loans are
excluded, the ERR is 20.7 per cent and the NPV is US$21.5 million. The results show that even lowering
the percentage of growth in medium-sized loans that is attributable to titling to 6.5 per cent, the ERR is
12.5 per cent and the NPV is US$1.1 million. While this is a simplified illustration of the potential
benefits, it suggests that even by taking very extreme assumptions the economic benefits from one of the
multiple channels of impact from titling clearly outweigh the economic costs of the project.


I.      Contribution of LMAP to microfinance

41.     In 2009, the Cambodian microfinance industry was serving over 1 million families, affecting
roughly 4.8 million people, or 36% of the population (Cambodian Microfinance Association - CMA 2008
Annual Report), in almost all of the country‟s 14,073 villages (National Institute of Statistics, General

                                                     50
Population Census of Cambodia 2008). Sector growth has sustained years of rapid growth, until the end
of 2008. The combined credit portfolio of the industry grew by 55% and 65% in 2007 and 2008,
respectively. Growth slowed significantly through September 2009 to 5%. Nevertheless, by that date the
total credit portfolio stood at US$828 million, serving around 1,080,000 clients and growing. Micro-
loans, defined as loans lower than US$10,000 dollars, represented around 12% of the total value of the
portfolio, while small loans, between US$10,000 and 20,000, represented 22% of the total value.
Medium loans, exceeding US$20,000, amounted to 45% of the overall value and around 5% of the total
number of loans, while other types of loans represented nearly 33% of the portfolio value for the same
year. While the relatively low average loan size is indicative of the service providers‟ commitment to the
low income population, it also reflects a gap in services available to the small and medium business sector,
especially in absence of a valuable collateral which is the precondition to access medium loans. Average
loan balance per borrower has grown rapidly over time from roughly US$400 in 2006 to more than
US$750 in 2009, reflecting the easing of credit requirements as the market has become deeper and more
competitive, but also partially to the improved collateralization possibilities provided by the expansion of
the land titling project managed by MLMUPC.

42.      Changes in borrowing behaviors in this direction were expected at the PAD stage, as many people
were expected to progressively shift from informal institutions (moneylenders and self-help groups) to
more formal institutions like micro-finance institutions and banks. The vast majority of loans - around
92% - made by Cambodian MFIs in 2009 were targeted to microenterprises, with residual amounts
dedicated to consumer, household, and mortgage lending. Over half of the lending was provided to
women; in 2008 and 2009, women composed 76 per cent of total borrowers. Sector data about credit
provides some useful information about the profile of rural financial service consumers and how the titles
can play an important role in access to formal types of financing. For example, in the 890 panel
households‟ interviews of the 2007 WB/CDRI study Moving out of Poverty, 71% of households had an
active loan and the average household had 2.3 loans. The averages were remarkably similar for all income
groups, from the comfortably rich to the chronically poor. The sources of those loans were, on average,
36% from relatives and friends, 23% from MFIs (a category that includes ACLEDA Bank and any
organized credit program), and 33% from money lenders and commodity middlemen. Since 2005, the
number of credit clients among the licensed service providers has increased almost seven times, with the
above-mentioned geographic dispersion.

43.     The CRDI study concludes that rural households are highly indebted and that use of informal
money lenders is high, implying that both conditions are sub-optimal. By itself, this demand data simply
supports the observation that informal lenders are willing to lend to borrowers that formal MFIs and
banks will not, and that informal lenders charge more for this service. In this context, the service
providers use a mix of individual and group lending, the latter for clients that are unable to produce the
necessary land collateral for individual loans. Access to credit for medium-size loans is very limited due
to lack of collateral. Despite the many efforts of the sector in meeting demand of the poor, according to
CDRI interviews and anecdotal evidence, people consider MFIs‟ and banks‟ conditions in many cases too
rigid and impossible to fulfill. They explain that they use informal, more flexible but also more expensive
sources, when the conditions of formal lenders are not flexible enough. Typically, this means that the
aspiring borrower is unable to produce the necessary collateral, or does not meet the formal lender‟s
underwriting requirements. In this connection, land titles represent an improvement in collateralization
and facilitate access to credit. The range of interest rates in Cambodia is tightly clustered compared to
other countries and are in the range of 1.6-2.0 per cent a month. In case a title is provided as collateral for
a loan up to US$20,000, better terms of credit can be obtained, in the range of a 0.2-0.3% improvement
compared to average monthly rates, which represent between 2.4% to 3.6% saving per year, compared to
the same loan not backed by a land title. Even though no additional benefit from reduced interest rates
have been found for medium loan, (usual interest rates are in the range of 1.6-1.7% per month),these
loans could not be obtained, at least formally, without providing a land title as collateral.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1      Two BAs were carried out during the implementation of the project (in 2006 and 2009) with the
main purpose of gauging overall beneficiary satisfaction and the impact of land titles for the beneficiaries
in areas covered by LMAP. The studies used a “mixed methods? approach to gauge perceptions and
satisfaction levels and to provide recommendations on how to improve the titling processes put in place
by the project.

5.2      The first BA covered twelve randomly-selected sites in nine provinces and Phnom Penh for a
total of 309 interviews. The assessment concluded that the majority of beneficiaries were satisfied with
the land titles received and that the adjudication process had met or exceeded the expectations of the
majority of respondents. Some further conclusions were:
(a)     Beneficiaries stated that the registration fee levels were acceptable.
(b)     Nearly half of respondents claimed access to credit as the key benefit from titling, although only
        19 per cent had loans outstanding. The study also suggested that the effects on credit access in
        the short term are limited and that the longer the time period elapsed since obtaining the titles the
        greater the number of landowners using land to access credit.

5.3     The second BA conducted in 2009 (involving ten randomly-selected sites, for a total of 485
beneficiaries interviewed, and separate focus group discussions for men and women covering 114
landowners) reinforced the findings of the first BA:
(a)     There was general satisfaction with the process of titling and the registration fees.
(b)     Improved access to credit followed by reduced conflict over land were seen as the main benefits
        from titling. Interviews with four banks and MFIs indicated that possession of a land title is
        generally not a major consideration for smaller loans but often speeds up the process of loan
        approval and helps to qualify borrowers for larger loans. In addition, representatives of
        institutions also mentioned that the increase of official land titles made it easier for them to avoid
        overlapping loans being secured by same property.
(c)     Registration of subsequent land transactions is taking place in only a small percentage of the total,
        given the generalized perceptions of it being an expensive and difficult process that lacks
        transparency.

Annex 7. Summary of the Borrower's Completion Report and its Comments on the Draft ICR

        The Land Management and Administration Project (LMAP, 2002-2009) was the first
phase of a larger Land Administration, Management and Distribution Programme (LAMDP) to
implement the 2001 Statement on Land Policy by the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC).
The overall goals of LMAP were to reduce poverty, promote social stability and stimulate
economic development. The specific objectives were to improve land tenure security and
promote the development of efficient land markets. LMAP was supported financially by the
World Bank (WB) for major investments and running costs of land registration while technical
assistance (TA) and some financing were provided by the Governments of Finland and Germany
and later also by the Government of Canada. Already years before the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness, several donors designed and implemented a land administration project where
inputs were properly coordinated in order to avoid overlapping to maximise benefits and
minimise waste.

       LMAP was divided into five Components: Component 1: Development of land policy
and regulatory framework; Component 2: Institutional development; Component 3: Land titling
program and development of a modern land registration system; Component 4: Strengthening
mechanisms for land dispute resolution; and Component 5: Land management. Although the
project was divided into components, and responsibilities were divided among several
development partners and TA teams, LMAP was only one project implemented by the
Cambodian Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC)
without establishing separate parallel structures. All components were interlinked and depended
on each other for the project to be successful as a whole. Component 3 performed the main role
of LMAP and it depended on the successful functioning of the other four Components.

       LMAP was supported through an IDA credit from the WB with an outlay of
US$24,300,000. The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) provided US$ 2,600,000. TA was
provided from the Governments of Finland in an amount that was originally but later
considerably exceeded US$ 3,500,000, and Germany provided US$ 3,500,000, again mainly in
the form of TA.

        The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was signed on March 27, 2002 and became
effective on June 19, 2002 and allowed LMAP to implement the activities of systematic land
registration from October 2003 to December 31, 2009, expanding from 4 pre-LMAP provinces
to 14 LMAP provinces out of which 11 were supported financially by IDA and 3 by the
Government of Canada.

        The main measurable indicators, targets and goals of LMAP were achieved and exceeded
by the end of the project in 2009.

       LMAP targets systematically adjudicating and surveying 1 million land titles but in fact
did 1,593,551. LMAP targets issuing 800,000 titles but in fact issued 1,232,396. All this was
accomplished at a record low cost for systematic registration programs in the world of less than
US$ 10 per parcel; the LMAP indicator for cost was US$ 30.


                                              58
        For the systematic registration program, around 1,000 Cambodian cadastral officers were
trained, equipped and supervised by GDCG and TA in 14 provinces and municipalities to
implement registration at the speed of 25,000-30,000 parcels per month, according to the
continuously improved comprehensive Land Registration Team (LRT) Manual. In addition,
more than 8,000 Administrative Commission (AC) members were trained for legal local-level
decision-making in land registration.

       Around 5,000 geodetic ground control points for cadastral surveying and orthophoto
production were established. Around 60,000 km2 of digital orthophotos were locally produced
with an established modern digital orthophoto production line and also more than 190,000 km2
of produced and procured orthophotos were quality-controlled under the project.

        To support systematic land registration, a successful Public Awareness and Community
Participation (PACP) and information dissemination concept was developed and established,
resulting in a high landowners‟ participation rate of more than 99%.

        A modern digital Cadastral Database and Geodatabase system was developed locally and
established to support effective and efficient systematic, sporadic and subsequent land
registration and continues to be developed further according to the official legal and technical
requirements.

       The necessary land-related policies and regulation framework were developed.

        Institutional development resulted in the establishment of the new Faculty of Land
Management and Administration (FLMA) at the Royal University of Agriculture (RUA) for
increasing human resources for the whole land sector. By the end of September 2009, 150 new
generation B.Sc‟s had graduated from the Faculty and 194 were studying. MLMUPC had
recruited 74 of them to the Ministry, mainly to join the Land Registration Teams( LRTs).
Lessons learned, team building and training workshops, on-the-job and hands-on training,
international study tours and continuous supervision played an important role in the capacity
building of the local cadastral staff.

        Mechanisms for land dispute resolution were strengthened by supporting the Cadastral
Commissions (CCs) in out-of-court dispute resolution. During LMAP, 3,500 CC members were
trained and 3,601 land disputed solved by them. Moreover during LMAP the systematic
registration Administrative Commissions resolved 14,113 disputes.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders



     CONSOLIDATED COMMENTS FROM CANADA, FINLAND and GERMANY

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Implementation Completion and Results
Report (IDA-36050 TF-53043) for the Land Management and Administration Project in
Cambodia.

The ICR essentially repackages various WB‟s reports on the LMAP project with the exception of
the Economic and Financial Analysis section.


1.0     GENERAL COMMENTS
Overall, the main issues to be raised are:
a) Inconsistency between the ICR performance rating of moderately unsatisfactory and the
findings of previous WB assessments/reviews and Joint Supervision Missions and the unclear
basis for the rating, i.e. insufficient monitoring and evaluation framework to support ratings of
outcomes and indicators.
b) ICR assessment of weaknesses at the policy and institutional level should take into account
the historical context of the Implementing Agency (a nascent institution; project expectations in
that regard may have been too high).
c) Need to expand on the lessons learned.


2.0    SPECIFIC COMMENTS
More specifically, our comments can be summarized below:
Section 1, Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
While the ICR‟s ex-post analysis of weaknesses in the project design are highly relevant, they
should take into consideration the historical context and need to be viewed in the Cambodian
context. The Implementing Agency the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and
Construction and the Council for Land Policy were only created in 1999. Institutional and
administrative capacities were almost non-existent, policies and legal framework had to be
developed from scratch. The project was appraised in October 2001, a mere two months after the
Land Law was adopted.

Para 1.1.4 describes the argument for embarking on a nation-wide titling programme to provide
tenure security. Footnote 10 refers to a “compelling counter argument? by pointing to highly
durable “traditional systems?. While the ICR only notes this as a footnote this view is also
expressed in one of the findings of the Inspection Panel‟s Report which states that the titling
process adopted by the project weakened pre-existing tenure rights. Neither the ICR nor the
IP Report however explain how “traditional systems? - which rely on possessory rights
over land being recognized by neighbours and local authorities - would be adequate to
protect against vested interests. What is described here as traditional systems of land rights is
just one element of it. Early works about land tenure security in Cambodia by the French

                                               60
colonial scholars (e.g. Jean Delvert‟s Le Paysan Cambodgien) would provide useful details on
land tenure in Cambodia.

On the other hand no evidence is presented that ownerships rights codified with a land title have
been subject to vested interests. We however agree that comprehensive subsequent registration is
essential to preserve the integrity of the cadastre. This has been highlighted in various Joint
Supervision Missions and necessary actions need to be taken.

Para 1.5.4 states that land titling and land registration provides for a necessary but not
sufficient condition for improved tenure security. It may be useful to clarify this statement.

Section 2 Key Factors affecting Implementation and Outcomes
Paras 2.1.10 and 2.1.11 address the adequacy of RGC‟s commitment in view of powerful vested
interests. Inefficient and sometimes non-existent inter-ministerial coordination remains a
significant challenge especially in the area of State Land Management. Weak inter-ministerial
coordination is a recurrent feature not only in the Land sector but also in a number of areas with
cross-cutting responsibilities (please clarify). The fragmentation is also reflected in the set-up
and de facto functioning of the main coordination mechanism (Technical Working Groups) and
impedes on the quality of political dialogue in other important high level fora such as the
Government Development Partner Coordination Committee and the Cambodia Development
Cooperation Forum. Development Partners have been grappling with these challenges and have
committed to engage with RGC in an effort to identify ways of improving the quality and depth
of policy dialogue (Result of an internal Donor workshop “Enhancing Policy Dialogue?, October
2011). This will be undertaken in the context of RGCs plans to review the aid management
policy in 2012.

Section 2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Paras 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 Application of safeguards/BKL:
We concur with the view expressed in various sections of the ICR that “the lack of specificity in
the project documents? may have contributed to the divergent views between the Bank and
RGC as to whether or not the RPF have been triggered (2.4.6). We take note that Management
has been unable to determine definitively whether the area in question was formally titled in the
name of the State which would have been an instance to trigger the RPF (2.4.7).
We would suggest that the ICR provide an update by mentioning the positive step taken by the
RGC issuing of a sub-decree on exclusion zone in BKL. Indeed the sub-decree was issued in
August 2011 i.e., during ICR preparation.

Section 2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase
Para 2.5.2 implies that because of the fact that no arrangements for the project‟s future operation
have been agreed, the “very real achievements of the project are threatened?. While fully
acknowledging the important contributions by the Bank and being cognizant of the challenges of
the Land sector reform, it should however not be overlooked that since the formal cancellation of
the loan by RGC, substantial progress has been achieved in key areas of LAMDP. Apart from the
country ownership, this is attributed to a continued critical but constructive engagement of the
Development Partners remaining in the land sector. Germany for e.g. has further strengthened



                                                61
the human rights aspects of its support and has used a milestone process to engage with RGC on
key issues. A similar approach is envisaged for the next programming cycle of German support.


Section 3 Assessment of Outcomes (also sections F, G)
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
General comment: A weak results framework, “vague and qualitative Project Development
Objectives (PDO)? and “…similarly abstract and difficult to measure Key Performance
Indicators? (KPI) (2.1.5) as well as non-existent baselines, the lack of defined methodologies and
attribution issues and lastly the late introduction of an M+E system in 2007 (para 2.3) are key
issues raised in the ICR. On the other hand and in terms of Development Objectives, 10 Joint
Supervision Missions (JSM) rated the project satisfactory, 5 JSM moderately satisfactory, one
JSM unsatisfactory. Only the final Enhanced Review Mission – which was not conducted as a
joint review mission including the other donors - concluded with a rating of moderately
unsatisfactory (section G).

In view of: a) the weaknesses of the results framework described above; b) in absence of
quantitative data for the KPI; and c) taking into account the ratings of the JSM in terms of
Development Objectives1 it is difficult to understand the basis on which the ICR determines
the overall assessment of the project to be moderately unsatisfactory2.

Sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.5 in particular, lead the reader to ask why other development partners
decided to continue working with the MLMUPC. Furthermore, the last 4 JSM undertaken by the
Donors supporting LASSP since the cancellation of the IDA credit confirm good progress
(including a very satisfied rating for the second JSM). A more extensive explanation of these
different positions would be helpful.

Section 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Outcomes
Para 3.2.3 refers to the KPI on “reduction of land grabbing?. It acknowledges that the process of
systematic land registration per se is in practice one of low-level conflict resolution and points
out that so far approx. 20,000 conflicts have been resolved in this process. With regard to the
“exclusion of households? from participation in the systematic titling process the ICR conveys
ambiguous messages. On page 12, intermediate outcome 11 the ICR states that “residual
concerns remain that the titling process is illegitimately excluding some households from the
titling process?, para 3.2.5 speak of a vicious circle and state that households were effectively
excluded. It would be extremely beneficial if this assessment could be backed up by strong
analytic and empirical evidence.



1
  Interestingly, the CAS Progress Report (April 2008) i.a. stated that “RGC‟s land titling
programme supported by LMAP has been a notable success (sic)? (3.1.3).
2
 Section F “Results Framework? states that due to a lack of baselines and in the absence of
agreed methodologies with the exception of KPI 6 (probably achieved) it “is impossible to
judge? whether KPI have been achieved or not.


                                               62
Furthermore, it is noted that the ICR puts greater emphasis on Component II, providing little
information on the achievement of the other components.

Section 5 Lessons Learned
The following lessons could be drawn from the ICR analysis. They are: a) on the design which
was ambitious, complex (five components with 18 sub-components to be implemented and
coordinated by a newly established ministry), flawed (without a baseline, targets and M&E
framework) and overly optimistic (given resources and timeframe), not to mention the need for
the project document to be clear (avoiding ambiguities). On the M&E framework, the ICR
argues that qualitative information can substitute the quantitative ones (footnote 1 page 7).
Unfortunately, qualitative information/assessment is subjective especially when there is no
baseline.

A further lesson would recognize the need to ensure that the local knowledge / local politics and
political economy context be clearly understood at the design phase, or at the appraisal phase
(ref. Context at the Appraisal, page 15). The ICR notes in several places about limited
understanding of the political economy.

Another lesson that can be drawn from the ICR relates to the Focus of Supervision Missions. The
ICR recognized that these Missions focussed on only a few aspects of the project, and
overlooked the others. A wider focus on the Missions may have avoided procurement issues, for
example. Perhaps a useful lesson would also be the need to design and monitor the procurement
component more closely.

Finally, improved monitoring and management of the risks would also be a worthwhile lesson.

Annex II Matrix of Objectives, Indicators and Achievements
Component 3: Titles are issued effectively and efficiently. The following statement: “There are
also concerns that the titling process is illegitimately excluding some households from the titling
process? needs clarification or should be deleted (Page 84).


3.0     EDITORIAL COMMENTS
Para 1.7.3 (page 19) about CIDA in the bracket – we suggest that you specify “through TFs in
2004?. We are quoting part of the sentence: “... include three additional provinces (utilizing a
grant from CIDA, which had joined the project in 2004 through Trust Funds with the provision
of TA)?.

Footnote 44 (page 38), In addition to the Heinrich Boll Foundation, a reference to the Gender
work undertaken by the CLASP project would be useful.

Corrections should be made of CIDA‟s name which should read as Canadian International
Development Agency (page 48).




                                                63
Also CIDA‟s contribution into the two TFs was C$5.0M and not USD1.42M as mentioned on
page 48.
