PROGRAM PEIFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
CHILE
FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOANS
(LOANS 2625-CB, 2767-CH AND 2892-CB)
PB FACE
1.       This is a Program Performance  Audit Report (PPAR) on Chile First,
Second, and Third Structural Adjustment Loans, involving three IBRD loans,
Loan 2625 in the amount of US$250 million; Loan 2767 in the amount of
US$250 million; and Loan 2892 in the amount of US$250 million, for a total
amount of US$750 million. Loan 2625 vas approved on October 22, 1985, and
became effective on November 12,  1985.    The Closing Date was October 31,
1986 and final disbursement was made on June 30, 1986. Loan 2767 was
approved on November 20, 1986, and became effective on November 24, 1986.
The Closing Date was December 31, 1987 and final disbursement was made on
June 15, 1987. Loan 2892 was approved on December 15, 1987 and became
effective on December 16, 1987.    The  Closing  Date was June 30, 1989 and
final disbursement was made on February 23, 1989.
2.       The  audit  consists  of  the  PPAR  prepared  by  the  Operations
Evaluation Department (ORD) and the Program Completion Report (PCR)
prepared by Country Operations Department IV, Latin America and the
Caribbean Region. The PPAR is based on the attached PCR, the President's
Reports, the loan documents, a study of project and country files, and
discussions with Bank staff. An OED mission visited Chile in June 1989 and
interviewed numerous past and present government officials who had been
involved with the formulation and implementation of Chile's economic
programs. The mission also met with private sector representatives and
with a diversity of academic and professional experts.
3.       The PCR provides a very good account and assesment of the program
experience, and discusses the performance of the Bank and the Borrower.
The PPAR elaborates on particular aspects such as the economic policies
pursued by the Chilean Governments prior to the introduction of the
Structural Adjustment Program, some innovative features of the latter--such
as the Government's program to rescue the financial sector--and the main
issues that emerged during the implementation of this program.
4.       The Govermnent's comments on the  PCR  are  included as Annex 5 to
the PCR. The draft Audit Report was also sent to the Borrower for conments
but no further comments were received.
5.       The Country Department has indicated  its basic agreement with the
general conclusions reached with regard to performance of the Structural
Adjustment Program and the supporting Structural Adjustment Loans, but was
unable because of the time constraint to review in depth the individual
chapters of the final report.

PROGRAM PERPOUM)WCE AUDIT REPORT
CHILE
FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOANS
(LOANS 2625-CH, 2767-CU AND 2892-Cl)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Overview
1.       The World  Bank  provided  three  successive Structural Adjustment
Loans (SALs) to Chile in 1985, 1986 and 1987, totaling US$750 million.
They were an essential part of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP)
undertaken by the Chilean administration beginning in 1985. The SAP con-
stituted the last stage among several that integrated the economic policy
of the Government which took power  in  1973.   Hence, an evaluation of the
Bank's SALs would be incomplete without reference to previous economic
policy, the SAP, and the Bank's role in the policy and financial package
that the international financial commnmity contributed to the Chilean
program.
2.       The Chilean Government's SAP produced  results, both on the demand
and on the supply side of the economy, that were dramatic improvements
compared with the  previous  period.   Comparing  the Chilean economy with
other Latin American countries during the period 1985-88, Chile's perfor-
mance was the best in terms of economic expansion. The SAP's growth and
fiscal performances were better than expected.
3.       The Bank was  relatively  disengaged  from  Chile between 1981 and
1984, but it reentered the scene in the second part of 1984, contributing
to the SAP design. The three SALs focused on three main problems: the
need to accelerate and to diversify exports, the insufficiency and disequi-
librium in savings-investment, and the financial disarray. The three SALs
supported a coherent and long-term adjustment program that the Government
initiated in early  1985.    SAL  III  stressed  long-term capital markets,
social security, and health.
4.       The key contribution of the Bank since late 1984 was two-fold:  to
instill a medium-term dimension and approach in economic policy and to make
such policy possible through direct and catalytic effects on financing. It
is generally recognized that successive short-term policies would have
doomed the adjustment effort to failure.   The permanent emphasis on export
promotion and savings mobilization and investment was well placed to alle-
viate the then most strategic weaknesses in the economy.
S.       Although the contribution of SAL II was less dramatic than that of
its predecessor, it was equally necessary to sustain the SAP. The main



additional emphasis was on cutting the terms and costs of financial reha-
bilitation, in which it  succeeded.    The  orientation of SAL III included
fast action in the social  sectors.    While  intended to balance the whole
package, its effects are more disputed than those of the earlier SALs. In
general, social expenditure was directed to the more needy sectors of the
population. This is true in the sense that the programs that were enhanced
were directed to alleviate the effects of unemployment. Here the impact of
this type of expenditure has been to alleviate the hardships of some groups
in extreme poverty. The next group up the income ladder, however, was made
worse off.
The Challenges Three Periods of Economic Policy
6.       The economic policy  of  the  Government  of Chile can be roughly
subdivided into three periods9
*   the early liberalization (1975-81);
*   economic crisis and transit-on (1982-84);
*   the Government's  Structural Adjustment Program (1985-88
and still continuing).
The Early Liberalization
7.       When the authorities took power in September 1973, they were faced
with record inflation, output that had been declining since 1971, a public
sector deficit exceeding 2O of gross domestic product (GDP), and a money
supply that was out of control.   The authorities initially stressed fiscal
order and some deregulation of  the  economy.   In 1975 real copper prices-
-copper represented over half of total exports--hit their lowest level in
20  years.    The  depth  of  the  economic  crisis  helped  to  define the
Government's economic policy of drastic austerity and liberalization.
8.       By 1976, a  fiscal  surplus was  achieved  by reducing the public
sector and improving its efficiency.   Prices were gradually freed, tax and
subsidy distortions removed, barriers to trade were lessened and exchange
controls were  eliminated.    Following  a  large  initial  devaluation the
exchange rate continued to be adjusted periodically for a while. Inflation
dropped to an annual rate of 302 and economic growth picked up, led by non-
traditional exports. Thus, despite low copper prices, the international
reserves recovered. This progress, however, was accompanied by a high rate
of unemployment.
9.       Furthermore, some of the  policies  implemented  after 1978 led to
unsustainable disequilibria. Chile's opening of its capital account, which
started gradually in 1978, was completed by April 1980. This, in conjunc-
tion with the fixing of the exchange rate in June 1979 and the full index-
ation of wages to past inflation, led to massive inflows of unguaranteed
long-term credit. These capital flows financed an unsustainable expansion
of private consumption and investment in 1980 and early 1981. The boom of



- xi -
that period was fundamentally financed with foreign credit. As a conse-
quence, external debt rose from US$6.7 billion at end-1978 to US$17.2
billion by end-1982, or the equivalent of 69Z of GDP. More than 1OOS of
the increase in debt during this period was contracted by the private
sector, since government net foreign liabilities declined continuously from
1975 to 1981.   At  the  same  time,  the  competitiveness of the country's
tradeable sector was being eroded by the fixed exchange rate. Furthermore,
the corporate sector was generally weakened by excessive real domestic
interest rates, which exceeded  30S  per  year  at  their  peak in the late
seventies.
10.      Finally, the financial sector was affected by the deterioration in
the quality of their loans. This was due to two main causess the general
problems of the corporate sector and the granting of credits to companies,
the ownership of which was related to that of the lending institutions.
This generalized practice undermined the stability and the public confi-
dence in the financial system.    With world interest rates at record high
levels, copper prices at record lows, and voluntary lending from abroad
discontinued, Chile belatedly devalued the peso in 1982, in the face of one
of the most severe crises in the country's modern history.
11.      On narrow economic grounds, liberalization  left a legacy of rela-
tive fiscal soundness and more efficient Government administration, a re-
allocation of resources more in line with international prices, and a
deregulation that made the economy more flexible. From a broader perspec-
tive, it exposed Chilean entrepreneurs to international competition,
elicited supply responses through institutional changes, created interest
groups supporting this economic approach, and nurtured a consensus in favor
of economic stability. But the shortcomings of the policy--chiefly, lack
of prudential supervision of financial institutions--increased the vulner-
ability of the economy to the point of collapse.
Economic Crisis and Transition
12.      The unavoidably sharp devaluation  and decline in expenditure were
followed by a massive economic crisis: a 15? fall in GDP (partly due to
falling terms of trade), 25? unemployment (despite 500,000 employed in low-
wage emergency employment programs, EEPs), and insolvency (partly hidden)
of half the productive and financial sectors. In January 1983, the author-
ities "intervened" some of the largest firms and banks to keep them afloat,
and the Central Bank had to provide subsidized credit to debtors. Internal
problems were compounded by the high (mostly private) foreign debt and
negative international setting. Interest payments on that debt amounted to
302 of exports and 502 of savings. The Government was forced to guarantee
part of private foreign obligations in order to reschedule its own debt
amortizations due in 1983-84 and to get new money to cover current account
deficits. Loans from international financial institutions were not forth-
coming.
13.      The severity of the 1983 adjustment (consumption 72 lower, invest-
ment down 15Z) put the stabilization program on track again and improved



- xii -
the external sector, but the public accounte deteriorated. An attempt at
recovery in 1984 proved unsustainable.    Imports rose 172, and the current
account deficit rebounded to 10? of GDP. An ensuing devaluation and rise in
Import tariffs--resisted by the business cammunity--from 20? to 35? failed
to bridge the external gap and sealed the fate of the country's fourth
economic team in two years.
14.      The crisis and transition  period. however, left other influences
besides the immediate, precarious situation, the main ones not purely
economic.   In  1984,  the  unsustainable  relief  from  the  crisis and an
unsuccessful attempt to revive protectionism forced a sounder analysis
whose outcome was the widely perceived need for a medium-term view of the
economy in order to avoid the repeated failures of short-term approaches
and to restore and sustain public confidence. It also endorsed a return to
a more liberal economic policy.
1S.      In early 1985, a new  Economic  Minister took charge.  Despite the
compression of income and imports (451 since 1981) and steady growth in
export volumes, Chile still required significant capital inflows, and
copper--now at very low prices--still provided more than 50? of foreign
exchange earnings. Chile's US$20 billion external debt equaled its GDP and
was five times the value of its merchandise exports. The main priorities
included recovery from extremely low levels of savings and investment and
the financial rehabilitation of banks and firms. These were key among the
many challenges to be faced.
The Government's Structural AdJustment Program
16.      The crucial  year  for Chile's  structural  adjustment effort was
1985. The administration decided to address the challenge decisively with
an approach that had evolved in late 1984, both in Chile and in the inter-
national financial institutions. Vhen the program was conceived, the coun-
try had the worst ratio of  foreign  debt  to  GDP in Latin America, with a
current balance of payments  deficit  of US$2.1  billion.   The open urban
unemployment rate was 18.5Z.    Investment was  13.6Z of GDP, and domestic
savings 12.6X--not enough to finance investment, and even less sufficient
to service the  foreign  debt.    The  overall fiscal deficit--quasi-fiscal
shortfalls aside--was at a maximm 4.42 of GDP, mostly due to near-peak
expenditures of 30.7? of  GDP.    The  current  fiscal surplus was far from
adequate to finance public investments of 6.4? of GDP.
17.      The crucial concepts of the  resulting SAP were that a medium-term
view was necessary for short-term stabilization to hold, and that the pol-
icy and financial elements, by mutual reinforcement, provided consistency
and continuity to the program.    The medium-term horizon led to multiyear
projections that helped to trace the consequences of alternative courses of
action--and to discard some. The tough decisions of setting and keeping a
high exchange rate--to raise public savings significantly and swiftly and
to let real wages fall--both allowed and were sustained by foreign finance:
the concept of a "policy and financial package' was developed with the
international institutions.



- xiii -
18.      Its design was clears
* a high and stable exchange rate, to stimulate exports and
Improve trade balance;
*   a fiscal  shock,  initially  in  both  supply and demand,
later with emphasis on ezpenditure restraint, to raise
public savings;
*   an effort to rehabilitate  the  financial sector in order
to increase private savings.
This macro-economic framework was directed at tackling the key vulnerabili-
ties of the  economys    to  generate  the  external and internal transfers
aecessary to avoid 'snowballing' of the foreign debt, and to generate
confidence in foreign and domestic lenders and investors so as to fill the
external gap and return to the growth path.
19.      This "core' was supplemented bys
*  measures--among  them, the   CSF--to  develop  noncopper
exports and efficient import substitution;
*   a voluntary debt reduction mechanism;
*   other measures to reorder public current expenditures and
Investment  (including  privatization   of  state  enter-
prises); and
* institutional changes in the financial markets.
20.      In the application of the  SAP, the new economic team blended the
approach of the 1970s--a free, open, privately operated economy with fiscal
equilibrium--with a realistic handling of specific problemss reasonable
domestic price bands for domestic producers of traditional crops; some
protection; finAncial freedom with supervision rules for banking enforced
by the Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF); moder-
ate, stable export-oriented exchange rate; wage restrictions to stimulate
employment; and debt conversion schemes.
21.      The implementation of the SAP can be divided into two stages: the
crucial year 1985, during which the financial package and some aspects of
the policy package were not yet settled; and the following three years
under the uninterrupted  financial arrangements.    The authorities showed
restraint at several opportunities--stopping an inflationary revival in
1987 and attenuating a 1988 boom. SAP implementation was helped, especial-
ly after 1987, by positive external shockst   a  fall in oil and a rise in
copper prices, lower interest rates, a cheaper U.S. dollar, and world eco-
nomic recovery.

The World Bank and the SAP
The Bank's Role
22.      The international financial institutions--the  1MF and World Bank-
-helped to design and implement essential components of the SAP's policy
and financial package. Before the SAP, the IM4 had agreed to two Stand-bys
for 1983 and 1984, which paved the way for two compensatory financing
facility purchases in 1983 and 1985 and for the subsequent US$750 million
extended Fund facility (EEF), which  became  a  crucial SAP component.  The
Bank had been relatively disengaged from Chile since 1981, but it reentered
the scene in the second part of 1984, contributing to the SAP design.
23.      In 1985 the two institutions put together a US$2 billion financial
package integrated by the IMF's EFF, the Bank's US$250 million SAL I, and
private banks' US$1.1 billion in new finance. To help wrap up the package,
the Bank set precedents by guaranteeing half of US$300 million in syndi-
cated B-loan co-financing for the highway sector. The Government, however,
had to yield to the private banks' pressure and guarantee part of the
private domestic debts. This opened the door to debt renegotiations with
the banks and with the Paris Club.    The conditions set by the IMF and the
Bank were mutually reinforcing. The former established macroeconomic goals
for the monetary, fiscal, and foreign sectors; the latter set conditions
for export promotion, sav3ngs mobilization, the public investment program
(PIP), financial rehabilitation, and  employment  generation.   In 1986 and
1987 the Bank approved SALS II and III, for US$250 million each, bringing
Its total SAL assistance  to  US$750  million.   Negotiations with creditor
banks in 1986 and 1988 rescheduled US$12.5 billion, with maturities trans-
ferred to 1988191. Chile obtained a retiming of (annual) interest payments
that implied savings of US$450 million.
24.      The "core" of the SAP  suffered  little  change since its start in
1985. Within it, the SALs I and II addressed three main problems: the
need to accelerate and to diversify exports, savings-investment insuffi-
ciency and disequilibrium, and the financial disarray. Other questions,
mostly social, were barely addressed. By late 1986 the SAP's initial phase
had been implemented. In SAL II the Bank emphasized the recapitalization
and reprivatization of banks and corporations while keeping the other
objectives. By the second part of 1987, except for external events, there
appeared to be little room for policy changes or for increases in consump-
tion. Thus the SAP's orientation was to maintain the policy framework.
SAL III placed its stress on long-term capital markets, social security,
and health, all of which affected the program's sustainability. The high-
lights of the main SAL components are summarized below.
The Structural Adiustment Loans (SAL8)
Non-copper Exports a Top Priority
25.      Poor price prospects  for Chile's  major  primary exports and its
huge foreign debt made expansion of noncopper exports a top priority. The
SAP cperated through:



*   the reduction of import tariffs,
*   a  real  exchange  rate  attractive  for  export-oriented
investment,
*   coordination of  investment  (channeling  to forestry and
infrastructure),
* a larger role for PROCHILE, the Chilean Export Promotion
Agency, in promoting small producers' exports, and
*   stabilization of  the  effects  of  copper market fluctu-
ations.
26.      Main actions were a 25?  real devaluation of the peso, maintenance
of the real exchange rate throughout the period, an establishment of the
Copper Stabilization Pund (CSF) to resist pressures from the volatility of
copper prices. The CSF became active in late 1987 and its reference price
bands were changed to strengthen  it.    Import tariffs (fixed by law since
June 1986) were reduced to a uniform 20S, and the application of an anti-
dumping surcharge  was  moderate.    Tax  and  credit measures strengthened
export stimuli.   An  insurance  system  reduced  the  risk  of opening new
markets, and legislation was enacted to help to develop export insurance
firms.   The  production  capacity  of  CODELCO,  the  Chilean State Copper
Corporation, increased moderately, and high-potential ore bodies were
opened to private investors.   As regards import substitution, the authori-
ties attracted investors for petroleum exploitation and exploration, for a
coal mine, for a methanol plant, and for salt production. Reference price
bands for wheat, oilseeds, and sugar were reduced.
Savints and Investment Increased
27.      To absorb the unemployed and  for the economy to grow, substantial
new Investment was needed; because interest payments on the external debt
would absorb much of savings for years ahead, savings had to be increased.
The major effort would be borne by the public sector, then the principal
debtor abroad. Hit by the impact of the earlier social security reform,
the income tax reform, and the financial relief for the banking system, the
administration resorted to the value-added tax (VAT), to taxes on luxury
goods, to sales of  assets,  and  to  expenditure  austerity.   Some of the
measures, like income tax reform, mobilized private savings; pension fund
administrators (AFPs) invested 4S of GDP.
28.      A three-year PIP, to avoid  the stop-and-go pattern of annual pro-
grams, focused more on exports and private investment. After World Bank
review, several projects (the Santiago subway, large highway and irrigation
projects) were eliminated in favor of faster, higher-return works (chiefly
maintenance  and  rehabilitation).    As  the  SAP  progressed, expenditure
austerity gained ground; there were more wage restraints and reductions in
social programs. The PIP included earthquake reconstruction and emphasized
private investment support (transportation) and upgrading production in



- Zvi .
public enterprises. In SAL III it was possible to sustain the level of the
PIP and to keep increasing public savings and reducing the fiscal deficit
while absorbing the costs of recapitalization of the banking system.
Reforms for Banks and Pirms
29.      To avoid  a  general collapse  of Chile's  firms  and banks, the
Central Bank had provided general debt rescheduling programs, preferential
exchange rates, and subsidized debt swaps. The Government guaranteed most
of the foreign debt of private financial entities. Thus, the losses of the
system--then at least US$3.5 billion--had to be borne entirely within the
country, threatening severe macroeconomic repercussions: massive transfers
and commitments to continue them into the future. An unsolved issue was
how to make up for the losses since 1987 (up to then, accomplished by for-
eign borrowing). The solution was to contain the subsidies to banks and
firms and to find resources to pay the past subsidies.
30.      The generalized reprogramming of  domestic loans ended by November
1985, and preferential exchange rates and subsidized swaps were discon-
tinued by December 1986. Bank supervision was strengthened. To recapital-
ize the banks, the Central Bank bought their bad loans, but the original
stockholders could not receive dividends until all these loans had been
repurchased. Legislation limited the public participation in the equity of
intervened banks to 492, of which at least one-fifth had to be sold annual-
ly to the private sector.    In  1986, through case-by-case debt renegotia-
tion, practically all "viable'  firms  had completed the financial arrange-
ments; the banking system had returned to a position of positive net worth;
and some banks had been sold.    There was time to move from rehabilitation
of firms to development of the capital market, while at the same time
pressing financial entities to regularize their situations. The authori-
ties moved to diversify the portfolios and to channel the funds of institu-
tional investors (for example, the APPs) into private debt and equity by
lifting restrictions; to encourage equity investments and intermediation
through fiscal measures; and to change all important risk classification
procedures.
New Activities Addressed Social Issues
31.      The main thrust of the new  activities was in the social aspects.
Several  studies were  started,  supported   by  a World  Bank  Technical
Assistance Loan (TAL).   In  the  final  stages  of  the SAP, as the fiscal
situation improved, the Government moved to protect the security of pension
funds by tightening regulations. It also adopted measures to increase the
efficiency of the system, to extend its long-ternm coverage, and to enhance
public confidence in the system. In 1988, current nonpersonLIel outlays for
health were increased to consolidate progress in maternal and child health
care, to extend it to cover chronic diseases, and to upgrade the efficiency
of the decentralized health care system.

Evaluation of the SAP
32.      Performance of the IAP can  be evaluated from different angles, by
comparisons of the behavior of the Chilean economy under the SAP with
respect tot
*   its evolution in previous periodst
* the behavior of the other economies;
*   programmed economic goals.
Although these comparisons enrich one's vision of the SAP's performance, it
cannot be ignored that they are essentially counterfactual historical exer-
cises. In one case the standard is past history; in another it is foreign
economics; in the third it is an imaginary scenario. The last of these,
however, is amenable to a disaggregation of the causes of the differences
between program and results.
Dramatic Comparisons with Previous Years
33.      The SAP launched in 1985 produced  effects, both on the demand and
on the supply side of the economy, that are dramatic compared with the
previous period (Table S.1).

Imports                               14.3                    6.7

Domestic savings                      -3.9                   17.4
National savings                     -27.2                   35.5
On the demand side, exports in real terms accelerated and consumption
reversed its earlier drop to a sustained growth. On the supply side, GDP-
-which had declined steadily--recovered to a growth rate of over 5Z. The
drastic drop in real imports during the recession was followed by 72 yearly
increases, roughly in line with  exports.    Both expanded faster than GDP,



- xviii -
reflecting the opening of the  economy.    The turnaround in investment was
overshadowed by an even more violent change in the behavior of both
national and domestic savings, which since 1985 have grown yearly by 17.4Z
and 35.51, respectively. The comparative evolution of other objective and
significant variables is shown in  Table  S.2.   Inflation declined and the
foreign and public sector balances improved b) 32 of GDP. The external
debt was stabilized below US$20 billion, and unemployment dropped markedly
(the EEPs were virtually ended).

Comparisons with Other Latin American Economies
34.      The highlights from comparing the  behavior of the Chilean economy
under the SAP (1985-88) with that of other Latin American countries are
presented in Table S.3. Chile's performance was the best in Latin America
in terms of economic expansion, which keeps accelerating, while in the
region growth has decelerated since  1986.  A contributing factor has been
the improvement in the capacity to import. Chile's exports climbed to 139
on average over  1985-89  (1984-100)  while  in  the  region  as a whole it
deteriorated to 93. In terms of inflation, Chile was well below the Latin
American average (and declining), whereas since 1986 inflation has acceler-
ated in most of the other countries. Chile's foreign debt declined by 0.62
annually--a performance surpassed only by Venezuela--while external indebt-
edness grew at 2.1Z annually in Latin America as a whole. International
comparisons of unemployment figures are not trustworthy because of methodo-
logical differences  among  countries.    But  quantitative and qualitative
indications suggest that unemployment was higher in Chile than in the rest
of Latin America until 1988.    The trend in Chilean unemployment, however,
has been downward throughout the SAP period, even though the Government has
practically discontinued its employment programs.



-  ix-
35.      The bottom line is that the evolution of the Chilean economy under
the SAP has been outstanding, albeit helped in part by marked terms of
trade improvements. A large part of the burden of adjustment has been
borne by laborers, and only after four years hae unemployment approached
nonmal levels and  real wages begun  to  Increase.    Chile'. comeback is
remarkable because it was one of the Latin American countries most severely
affected by the 1982 international debt crisis.

Programmed Economic Goals and Results
36.      The discrepancies between the  goals  set and the results achieved
in the main variables of the SAP are summarized in Table S.4. These are
compared to the targets and projections included in earlier stabilization
programs, supported by the  IMP.   Under  the  SAP, both growth and fiscal
performances were better than expected:    the mean deviations were smaller
and showed overcompliance with the goals; the variance of the devlation.
was also smaller, suggesting a more consistent policy. If compared with
the 1982-84 programs,the SAP performance is not only superior in compliance
with goals; it also shows smaller and more stable deviations, perhaps the
consequence of a more consistent and firm set of measures and of rapid
reactions to circumstances. One reason that the SAP surpassed several of
its goals was that strong positive external shocks helped growth, the
balance of payments, and public finance.  When the policies were designed,

Lessons from the Chilean SAP
Importance of Country's history in Program Design and
Imlementation
40.      One clear lesson from the  Chilean experience is the importance of
the background of a country's recent economic history for the success of a
SAP--and thus the importance of taking that history into account in the



- xxii -
program's design and implementation, not only to avoid errors but also to
enhance chances of success. Some of the features of the preceding liberal-
ization, crisis, and transition that influenced the SAP includes
o   private external debts  are  risks  not  only for foreign
creditors but also for the entire domestic economy;
*   firms may not be  able  to  adjust fast enough to survive
the simulcaneous impact of up-hill competition from
imports and of high real interest ratesg
*   banking prudential rules  and  surveillance are necessary
safeguards  for  the   operation  of  domestic  financial
markets, rather than unnecessary restrictions.
Other Lessons From the 1985-89 Period
* It seems the essence of economic crises that (a) it takes
a long time to fully understand all their implications,
and (b) current institutional arrangements may be inade-
quate or too unstable to handle them;
*   in terms of the  Chilean  financial  crisis, only in late
1982 were there first quantitative estimates of its mag-
nitude, and it took several years (and finance ministers)
to bring it under control;
-   It is necessary to separate monetary effects from distri-
butional, allocative, and waste (in terms of lost con-
sumption and investment) effects of the financial crisis.
Importance of *Ownershi&' of Program
41.      Another lesson of the Chilean experience is that Chile 'owned" its
SAP. The program design was Chilean, and this greatly helped implementa-
tion. The DMF, active since the early 1980s, gave support and policy
advice. The World Bank was active and preparing for future action by mid-
1984. But if the SAP incorporated the ideas or suggestions of these insti-
tutions, it did so through coincidence or persuasion, not by imposition.
This experience also commends a sound, simple conceptual framework and its
adaptation to particular aspects of reality.   A corollary is a clear sepa-
ration of the essential--nounegotiable--elements of the program from other
aspects or effects.
42.      Another element in the  SAP's  success  was that it adopted fairly
conservative estimates of exogenous factors (for instance, the copper
price). Although the program consequently looked too restrictive initial-
ly, it demanded more from economic policy and left some leeway to respond
to requirements later on. The Government was committed to the SAP: the
President was convinced; the new economic minister had total authority; and
there was support from other cabinet members.



- xxiii -
Importance of Political Cohesion and Quality Economic Leadership
43.      Thus, another lesson from  the  SAP's implementation is the impor-
tance of full political support and cohesion behind the program and of the
quality of the economic team and supporting technocracy. But would Chile's
success have been possible under a different political economy? There are
as many counterfactual historical as ideological angles, and no objective
criterion exists to select among  them.    But history provides examples of
successes and failures under both democratic and authoritarian regimes.
Catalytic Effect of the Bank's Intervention
44.      Another observation is the decisive catalytic effect of the Bank's
intervention, due to the faith it showed in the program's eventual success.
This suggests that it is wise for the Bank to bide its time, so as to step
in when the Government has shown its determination, while continuing to
monitor the country along the path of program design and early implementa-
tion. The administration did not loosen its grip on the SAP when positive
external shocks set in. with excellent results; this underlines the impor-
tance of keeping to the right priorities--and also keeping an eye on not
relaxing because of early  successes.    The  implementation  of the SAP in
Chile faced no serious resistance; institutional reforms were smooth and,
after generally sound studies, were rapidly performed. The Government's
commitment was exceptional; the external environment was better than
expected; and the economic policies were correct (with some nonprice ques-
tions debatable). The SAP could not have been the same without support
from the international financial institutions--for example, in the service
of foreign debt, where the Bank played a key role. The Bank provided good
advice on the whole, and  proper  disbursements.   There again, the ensuing
success validates the usual criteria for implementation of SAPs.
Replicability of SAP Experiences and Its Sustainability
45.      The replicability of experiences  with reference to sustainability
very much depends on the political economy of the particular country and
its external environment. With all these caveats, some observations may be
ventured.
*   Structural adjustment, as a  form  of social change, ini-
tially faces resistance, but as it proceeds (and if it
starts to work) it gains adepts and loses opponents.
Continuity of the program in itself reinforces sustain-
abilitys    this  observation  supports  the  practice of
granting successive SALs during spans of no less than
three years.
*   Creating reserves, during  economic  upswings,  is a con-
venient way to prepare for downswings--as was the case
with the CSF. Later, part of the reserves were devoted
to solving a longer-term problem--reducing the foreign
debt.



-   iv -
* Those features of adjustment that imply direct participa-
tion of the population (in the Chilean case, 'popular
capitalism*) create wider support for the system of poli-
cies.
Summing up the SAP Experience
46.      The performance  of Chile  in  terms  of  the usual macroeconomic
goals--GDP growth, inflation, current balance of payments, foreign trade,
and fiscal results with respect to GDP--has been very favorable compared
with previous periods, with Latin American countries, and with the pro-
grammed goals. The SAP provoked sharp positive trend reversals in all
major objective variables, with marked improvements within the period.
Almost all of the overcompliance with GDP growth goals in 1987 an 1988 is
explained by the direct effects of unanticipated positive external shocks.
If these shocks also had indirect effects, it can be argued that perfor-
mance without the shocks vould have fallen short of the goals. But this
ignores the policy reactions of the authorities under alternative condi-
tions. On the whole, and taking account of the observations in the
Technical Appendix, the model behind the projections (the model of the
Central Bank) portrayed adequately the principal interactions of the
Chilean economy.
4'7.     The lesson to draw from  the controversial evolution of the social
sectors during the SAP is that the main content of the SAP should not be
compromised for short-run social improvements made at the cost of economic
growth and adjustment.    However,  some  low-cost  concessions to palliate
extreme or focused social problems enhanced the SAP's sustainability.
48.      In terms of a  conventional checklist  of sustainability of SAPs,
Chile scores high. The adjustment policy did not suffer from sociopolit-
ical overoptimism and followed closely its original design, with some ade-
quate changes in emphasis and a few concessions. There were significant
reforms and widely recognized competence in economic management. The coun-
try is far better prepared to face its problems than it was four years ago,
but important challenges remain.
Lessons From the SALS
Exchange Rates and Export Promotion
49. *   A main element  in  successful  adjustment is a realistic
and stable exchange rate, whose credibility is a prereq-
uisite for economic agents  to invest in an intrinsically
risky activity such as exporting.
*   Early  achievement  of  a  critical  mass  of diversified
exports sufficient  to  create  a  new  class of interest
groups with enough political power to resist changes in
economic policies  that would  penalize  exports  to the
point of interrupting their normal flow is important.



- XXv -
* It is Important to look at export promtion gas a whole*:
including institutional developments (such as port opera-
tions), focused infrastructure, direct "new activities'
programs, etc.
Public Sector Management
50.      The main lessons from Chile's public sector manag8ment are differ-
ent expressions of  centuries-old  sound  criteria:    austerity to restore
equlibrium and sensible administration.   The  backbone of the success was
the set of difficult decisions on the expenditure side, some of them firmly
proposed and backed by  the  Bank:    ending  the bail-out of the financial
system, allowing wages to fall to levels compatible with foreign competi-
tion, containing the EEP and health expenditures through creative specific
programs, and streamlining the PIP by higher-return and better-quality
investments.
51.      $he fiscal and monetary  handling  of  the  cost of the financial
crisis was also important.   In  Chile  the fiscal effects of high interest
rates and devaluation were compensated as those of trade liberalization
would bes the tax system was improved. The solutions did not suffer from
delays, except in the organization of decentralized activities. The debat-
able aspects were the distributional effects of some policies. Here again,
replicability of the experience may be limited because of the specific
political conditions and of the very low initial level of domestic public
debt.
Foreign Debts of Private Firms
52.      An analysis  of  financial  crises  shows  that widespread foreign
debts of private firms do not commit the Government as long as the economy
is in a normal  situation.    However,  if  there  is a balance of payments
crisis, the whole economy bears the exchange burden. If there is a domes-
tic financial crisis, the State bears the brunt of the cost and is unlikely
to succeed in transferring to foreign creditors their proportional share of
costs--unless it itself becomes insolvent, but this would entail other
costs to the country. The moral is to only adopt rehabilitation measures
to avoid the collapse of the "viable' companies and banks, thus limiting
costs. This often calls for making 'stock' losses explicit and for design-
ing how they will be supported and financed while cushioning their infla-
tionary, distributional, and allocative  effects.   The World Bank followed
the adjustment process in Chile by shifting the emphasis in successive
SALe8 first to stabilize the financial sector, then to limit Government
involvement, and finally to recapitalize financial entities and develop
capital markets. An especially useful Bank contribution was its guidance
and support in developing an exemplary system of prudential rules and sur-
veillance system for financial institutions.    It was learned that initial
panic and disorder tend to hasten salvage measures, which are often ineffi-
cient and costly. In the Chilean experience, the benefits of rapid recapi-
talization, without 'statization' of the system--in terms of confidence,
fluidity, and savings-investment behavior--justified the element of subsidy
in the price of shares offered to the public.

SALs and the Social Sectors
53.      To draw lessons from  the  performance  of  the SALs in the social
sectors faces several difficultiess
*   separating the effects of the measures adopted since 1985
from the trend of previous years, since in those sectors
delays are longer than in many productive activities;
*   agreeing on the  criteria  and  figures,  which are hotly
contested, to appraise the situations.
Some observations are:
* a large portion of the containment in social expenditures
came from a fall in public sector real wages, which
cannot be sustained indefilnitelyt
* extreme targeting can alleviate narrowly defined--often
pressing--problems but is no substitute for a long-term
sectoral solution and frequently causes imbalances that
increase tensions later;
* a corollary to both cases is that the sacrifices ex-
tracted from, and the palliatives given to, the social
sectors--while  congruent  with   the   economic  policy
approach--are mostly short-term solutions that require
compensation later, and that projections for future years
should take this  into  account:    selective recovery of
real wages,   restoration   of maintenance,  rebuilding
infrastructure. etc.
*   another corollary is that the period of adjustment should
also be used to design and begin structural adjustments
In the social sectors, and that the phasing out of struc-
tural  adjustment  assistance   should  contemplate  some
social sector loans;
* the most important special programs were those oriented
toward the poor. The perception is that the lower-middle
classes and the not-so-poor suffered more, at least rela-
tively. On the other hand, it is possible that this
perception is  exaggerated:    the  protest  voice of the
lover-middle class is frequently stronger in relation to
that of the poor.
Lessons For the World Bank's SAL Activity
Maintaining and Active Policy Dialogue
54.      Owing to the Government's reluctance  to maintain an active policy
dialogue with the Bank, beginning in 1981 the Bank's activity in Chile



- xxvii -
dwindled, as reflected in the staff inputs assigned to cover the country.
It was only by mid-1984 that the Bank became once again active in the coun-
try, and it resumed a significant role.   The IMF was present in Chile dur-
ing the years that the Bank was  not.    This was of no practical signifi-
cance, but it could be elsewhere.  There  is some merit in a policy of hav-
ing the Bank keep closer monitoring--if no physical presence--with country
authorities even in periods of little Bank activity in the country. There
are, of course, cost considerations here. But coordination and division of
labor with other international institutions may reduce some costs.
Desirability of Having a Small Number of Conditions
55.      In contrast with SALs I and  II, in SAL III targets were more dis-
persed and less focused, owing to the incorporation of a variety of social
aspects. This trait of the last SAL has been subject to some criticism in
Chile on several grounds. A first observation is the desirability of hav-
ing a suall number of conditions--four to six as a rule of thumb--related
to the core of the SAP, whose compliance should be strictly controlled.
Other less essential aspects could be subject to monitoring, unrelated to
tranche releases; but even then, it is advisable to keep their number at a
minimum. Another corollary is the need for restraint in changing the con-
ditions of successive SALs. A related question--since it is more common to
find a target requiring several actions than vice versa--is to find a
proper balance between conditions based on results and on activities. A
last (but not least) recommendation is careful preparatory economic and
sector vork, in close contact with the country, as a basis for the determi-
nation  of  reasonable   policy   conditions,   which  then  become  shared
objectives.
Monitoring: Linking SAL to the SAP
56.      Chile's performance was so good that  it left few issues for moni-
toring. There were a few cases of promptly corrected near compliance and
notable overcompliances, as in GDP growth and in the current balance of
payments. The function, then, was one of alerting the authorities and
speeding their actions. A message here is that six-month tranching leads
to a timing of Bank missions that allows them to control execution and to
determine the basic elements of the next SAL. A corollary is that monitor-
itg should not be too narrowly focussed on compliance but also on linking
the SAL fimly to the overall SAP.
SAL Time Limitations and Phase-Out Plan
57.      Projections of the capital account  of the Chilean balance of pay-
ments show that debt-service obligations will continue to represent a heavy
burden. This observation suggests the convenience of setting a time limit-
-three to five years at most as a rule of thumb--for successive SALs and a
prospective phase-out program from the onset, in order to avoid substitut-
ing debt accumulation for domestic efforts.    There is a need for a fairly
gradual phase-out scheme in  countries  whose  export earnings are volatile
and dependent on external factors.   A  final matter related to phasing out



- Xviii -
is the possibility that the country's good behavior may be penalized, since
it repurchased its debts at higher prices than others and may be excluded
from the Brady plan. While this is at most a half truth, a corollary is to
avoid, as far as possible, perverse incentives in solutions to the debt
problem.
Lessons for Evaluation: Grasping the 'Black Box' of Inter-
relationships
S8.      Finally, there are lessons to  learn  about evaluation itself.  It
is in the nature of evaluations to try to grasp all the richness of reality
without pre-conceive4, rigid formats and to look beyond the mere control of
goal and target compliance.    But  it  also helps  evaluation to know, as
explicitly as possible, the simplified 'model' of reality that lies behind
a program.
59.      An important  element  is,  thus. the methodology  of evaluation
itself. The objective is to grasp the 'black box' of interrelations among
variables and among objectives and policies, but to stop short of con-
structing full-fledged, sophisticated models.    That is, to have available
the few computer runs that were taken into account in designing the program
or in setting targets would be useful for understanding the rationale
applied and the options faced. Considerations of efficiency and cost point
in the same direction. A practice of the utmost importance in evaluation,
however, is contact with a large and varied number of people in the recip-
ient country itself. They bring to the evaluation points of view, empiri-
cal data, and a variety of perceptions and value judgments impossible to
grasp or even imagine from  afar.    It  is this vivid experience that adds
content and conviction to the evaluation, an exercise always in danger of
remaining formal or superficial.
60.      A final element is institutional memorys not only the availabili-
ty of records, but also the ease and speed of retrieval, selection, and
classification. Institutional memory in the Bank is satisfactory and quite
good in comparative terms.   The costs of obtaining additional improvements
are probably high in terms of a scarce resource--staff time.
Some Open Issues
A Question of Timing
61.      A first open issue refers to the timing of the Bank's active pres-
ence in the country.  Until early  1983  the Chilean economic team was so
convinced that its own program was flawless, that it could not be motivated
to enter into a meaningful policy discussion with the Bank. The Bank sub-
mitted important memoranda to the authorities showing that their present
policies were untenable, but such presentations were essentially ignored.
However, a small window of opportunity may have opened in mid-1983 during
which a decisive Bank effort to put together a SAL might have elicited a
more positive Government  response.   Would  a  SAL in 1983--by supporting
Minister Caceres' effort and reduce some of the costs of his policy--have



- xxix -
extended the program and so avoided the more expensive adjustment later?
Or would a SAL at that time  have  been insufficient in any case to sustain
politically the program, making more difficult the Bank's reappearance
afterwards? From the Bank's side, the proper questions ares Would the
Bank have given Chile a SAL in 1983 if the preparations at the technical
level were ready? Or would it have waited in any case until 1985 because
the international financial atmosphere and the political sensitivities of
its Executive Board were not favorable?
62.      A majority of observers feel that had the lank come forward with a
SAL for Chile in 1983, both the economic and the political environments
were not sufficiently favorable to give the SAL good cbances of turning the
economic tide. Maybe, even at high cost, the experience of minimal relief
and the danger of retreating from a 'liberal" approach was a necessary
condition for gathering solid support behind a new stabilixation-plus-
adjustment effort. By the same  token, it  is not clear that the interna-
tional flnancial coamunity or the Bank's Board were ready to approach the
relation with Chile decisively and with a medium-term view. In fact, such
a view started to evolve at the end of 1983 but only gained full acceptance
in late 1984. Against this background of doubtful counterfactual histor-
ies, there is the conclusive evidence of the successful SAL operations
started in 1985, when the situation was ripe for action and both Chile and
the Bank seized the opportunity.
Income-Distributional and Allocative Implications of the Fiscal
Costs
63.      A subject of debate in  Chile  is whether the fiscal costs (bene-
fits) of some important policies during 1985-88 could have been substan-
tially cut (extended)s    specifically,  the  salvage and rehabilitation of
banks and corporations5 the debt conversions; and the privatization of
enterprises (the last two were not part of the SALs but have important
implications for the SAP and its oustainability). The whole question has
important income-distributional and allocative consequences. For the first
theme, relevant figures of the public sector have been obtained.
Table S.6
Chile:  Fiscal Costs of Financial Rescue Operations
(in Percent of GDP)
1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987
Non-financial results        -3.9    -3.5    -4.5    -2.9    -1.5       0.3
Financial results             0.7    -6.2    -6.0   -20.9    -3.9       0.3
Quasi-fiscal               (-5.3)  (-4.3)  (-4.8)  (-7.3)  1-2.9)  (-1.3)
Total                      -3.2    -9.7   -10.5   -23.8    -5.4    -0.1



-     -
These figures show both the size of the financial crisis for public fi-
nances--roughly 52.62 cumulatively of a full year's GDP in five years--and
its rapid falling off after 1985, partly as a consequence of SAL condition-
ality.   The  monetary  impact  has  been  spread  over time significantly.
through increased public indebtedness (domestic and foreign).
Social Effects of SAP
64.      Whatever the opinions about the growth rate of the Chilean economy
from 1973 to  1984,  the  lower-income  segments  of the population clearly
carried a severe burden in the form of high, prolonged unemployment and
relatively low average real wages (the figures are worse if the EEPs are
included). The SAP had positive effects on growth, employment, and real
wages (better if the EUPs are included), but the Governtment's policies in
the social sectors were  severely  restricted by public expenditure auster-
ity. Officials of the previous administration defended the policies on the
basis that good macroeconomic performance--in the face of the problems
confronted in 1985--was the best possible response to social needs, that
aggregate social expenditures did not decline under the SAP, and that the
SAP more effectively achieved social goals because of increases in produc-
tivity and a better targeting of expenditures to the poorest strata of
society.
65.      Critics of the  past  Government,  often  referring  to the entire
period of its tenure, point out that SAP policies imposed a severe burden
on the low-income segment of the population; that high-income groups cap-
tured a large share of social benefits (for example, housing) because many
of the program elements were not redistributive (for example, the social
security system); that there were many inequities and no social safety net;
and that some programs, while effective in a narrow focus, were short-
sighted and not integrated into sectoral strategies, especially in health
and education. Figures from different sources give divergent views of the
evolution of social expenditure.   There  are  no uncontested answers.  The
opposite argument appears well-founded and  strong.   With regard to social
expenditures the picture is mixed. Evidence tends to show declining public
health expenditures and a less than progressive structure, although several
specific programs (such as maternal and child care) were successful and
oriented toward the poorest. On the other hand, other categories of social
expenditures increased markedly, most notably social security and social
welfare.
The SAP and the Achievement of Sustained Growth
66.      A question of the utmost  importance is whether the four-year SAP,
supported by the international financial institutions, has effectively
placed Chile on the path of sustained growth--to keep unemployment at
acceptable rates while managing service of the foreign debt.
67.      Economic progress since the crisis  has been remarkable.  GDP rose
7S in 1988 (the third consecutive year above 5.5Z)--regaining in per capita
terms its 1981 peak. Open unemployment dropped from 14.5? in 1982 to 8.8?
in 1988, and the  EEPs  have  practically  ended.  Although consumption is
16.32 below its 1982 record, inv.. -ient recovered from 9.8S of GDP (less
than the capital stock depreciation) to 16.8Z in 1988, supported by an
upsurge in the domestic savings (from 9.42 of GDP in 1982 to 24Z now). The



- xxxi -
trade balance moved from a US$2.7 billion deficit in 1981 to a US$2.2
billion surplus in 1988, vita non-copper export growth outperforming copper
export growth every year, even after the sharp copper price recovery since
1987. The terms of trade are 52 off their peak of 100 in 1980 (the trough
was 76 in 1986). The current balance of payments deficit was still US$200
million in 1988, down from US$4.7 billion in 1981 and US$2.1 billion in
1984. The external debt declined from a maximum of US$20.7 billion in 1986
to US$19.0 billion in 1988. The usual ratios improved as followss
* total foreign debt/annual exports, from 4571 in 1986 to
230X now;.
* debtIGDP, from 1271 in 1986 to 862 today;
* interest on foreign debtlexports, from 52? in 1982 to 22?
currently; and
e   interest on domestic  and  foreign  debtiDP, from 121  in
1985 to 8? in 1988.
The worst fiscal year was 1982, with a current deficit of 4.4? of GDP; in
1988 it was a 7.6? surplus, mostly due to a decline of expenditures from
30.71 to 24.52 of GDP. The overall deficit of 4.42 of GDP became a 0.52
surplus. The Central Bank deficit also has lost significance lately.
Difficult Economic Management Challenges Ahead
68.      Thus, today's picture of the  Chilean  economy may suggest that it
is well on the path of self-sustained  growth.   A closer look at the facts
and figures as well as at likely trends and developments, however, tends to
qualify such assessment and to raise important doubts. As indicated ear-
lier, a significant part of GDP expansion in the past two years is directly
attributable to positive external shocks; the excess of domestic savings
over investment does not cover interest on the foreign debt; thus, addi-
tional foreign finance and renegotiations will be needed, as well as con-
tinued efforts to mobilize domestic savings.
69.      Other questions come  from  future  trends  and developments, both
external and internal.   The  economy  is  still highly dependent on copper
exports. The price of copper has passed its peak--some experts predict a
decline to historical levels--though initially the fiscal impact will be
cushioned by resorting to the CSF.   The growth of the leading fruit export
is declining, except for some specialty and new products. Although there
has been an expansion of capacity in the production of copper, gold, for-
estry products, and in efficient import substitutions, there are health and
education needs whose satisfaction has been long delayed. Similarly, there
will be higher investment requirements in economic infrastructure and pro-
duction, both because of previous postponements and because of the need for
additional capacity. On balance then, in spite of the remarkable accom-
plishment of the Government's SAP and of the supporting SALs, the new
authorities face a difficult economic management challenge in the years
ahead.



PROGRAM PERPOENANCE AUDIT REPORT
CIIILE
FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTHMENT LOANS
(LOANS 2625-Cl, 2767-CH AND 2892-CH)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     As described in Section II of the Program Completion Report (PCR),
Chile's sustained efforts toward structural adjustment date to 1973, and
have gone through different phases.   A  crucial year was 1985.  First, the
Government and the 11F entered into an Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
arrangement in 1985, followed later in the year by the first of the Vorld
Bank's Structural Adjustment loans (SALs) and by creditor banks new loans.
These provisions completed a financial and policy package that set the
basis for the still ongoing Structural Adjustment Program (SAP).
1.02     From the point of view  of  this Program Performance Audit Report,
the Bank's participation in Chile provides two sources to draw lessons from
the ex-perience: the Chilean SAP as a whole, and the role and imbrication
(or *overlap') of the Bank's invulvement within the SAP it helped to
energize.   The  relation  between  a  program  performance  audit  and its
corresponding PCR is analogous to that between external and internal audits
of a firm.   The  latter  concentrates  on  specificity, whereas the former
takes a wider perspective.
1.03     The organization of  the  Report  reflects  this conception.  This
chapter summarizes  and  appraises  the  economic  background.   Chapter II
describes and appraises different aspects of the SAP and the Bank's role
through its  SALs:    implementation;  and  economic,  sectoral  and social
impact. Chapter III provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Bank's SALs
and Chapter IV presents the main findings and issues of the audit. The
Technical Appendix contains an analytical framework for quantitative ex
post evaluation of structural adjustment efforts.
A. Background
1.04     From the 19309 until  1973  the  predominant economic policies of
Chilean Governments were import substitution and active intervention
(extended controls of prices and quantities, widespread taxes and subsi-
dies) and increasing public  ownership  and management.   The results were
often disappointing: low growth, rapid inflation, inefficient production,
dependence on copper exports (60Z of total exports), and balance of pay-
ments problems reflected in a growing foreign debt. Periodic efforts to
reverse these trends proved insufficient.
1.05     The Government that  took  power  in  September  1973 faced world-
record inflation, negative international reserves, and arrears in foreign



- I -
debt  payments.    Output  had  been  declining  since  1971,  the  central
Government deficit exceeded 202 of gross domestic product (GPP), the money
supply was out of control, the financial system was nearly destroyed, and
the domestic currency was grossly overvalued.
1.06     The administration's economic policy stressed private initiatives,
free market forces, and the opening of foreign trade and capital movements.
It gradually freed prices, removed tax and subsidy distortions, lessened
trade barriers sharply, and eliminated foreign exchange controls. After a
huge devaluation, the exchange rate was periodically adjusted. The public
sector was reduced, its deficit became a surplus in 1976, and the Govern-
ment's efficiency improved dramatically.
1.07     In 1975 real copper  prices  hit  their  lowest  level in 20 years
while inflation continued.    In  April  1975  the administration applied a
drastic austerity program that was followed by the worst depression since
the 1930s with the trough in 1976:1.
1.08     By 1977 GDP had  returned  to  1974  levels, and in 1978 inflation
dropped to 30? (down from 6002 in 1973). Non-traditional exports grew 30?;
despite low copper prices and heavy foreign debt service, international
reserves were 4.5 months of imports. Government efficiency kept improving.
The boom (7Z yearly growth) lasted until 1980 and led the Bank to foresee
continuous economic growth, alleviation of extreme poverty, and full
employment by  1985.    Instead,  in  1982-83  Chile  experienced its worst
depression in 50 years--caused by inconsistent macro-economic policies,
extremely  low  copper  prices,  high   real  interest  rates,  and  global
recession.
1.09     In July 1979 the authorities had  pegged the peso to the US dollar
(the peg would last three years); since Chilean inflation was twice US
Inflation, the peso appreciated by more than 25? while wages remained
indexed. Tradable goods industries, already suffering from tariff reduc-
tions, were severely affected.    In  spite  of  clear indications that the
growing overvaluation of the currency was imposing a heavy burden on the
domestic economy, the authorities refused to devalue. They believed that
domestic prices would fall, thus restoring international competitiveness.
Capital movements were freed, and with foreign real interest rates well
below domestic rates, the incentive to borrow abroad was strong. There was
an import boom, fueled by a doubling of the external debt to 70? of GDP,
most of it private. The 1980 and 1981 trade deficits proved unsustainable,
the resource gap reached 102 of GDP, and interest payments on foreign debt
rose to 7S of GDP.   By  the  time voluntary outside lending ended in 1982,
real world interest rates had reached record highs, copper prices had
plummeted to record lows, and Chile was forced to devalue.
1.10     The 1982 expenditure reduction  and devaluation were the immediate
cause of a massive crisis: a 15? fall in GDP (due in part to the deterio-
ration in the terms of trade), 25Z unemployment (despite 500,000 jobs
created by emergency programs), and insolvency of half the productive
sectors and of the largest banks (partially hidden because of the



interlocking relations between corporations and financial institutions).
In January 1983 the government was forced to intervene some of the largest
banks. To keep firms and banks alive, the Central Bank decided to provide
subsidized loans to debtors in general.
1.11     Domestic problems were compounded by the high foreign debt and the
unfavorable international setting.   Interest  on  the foreign debt reached
302 of exports and 50? of domestic savings. The Government was forced to
assume the guarantee of part of the private sector's foreign obligations in
order to reschedule the 1983-84 amortization payments and to get new money
for  the  1983  current   accoint   deficit.      Loans  from  international
institutions were not  forthcoming:    earlier  reluctance  to use official
borrowing had drained the Chilean official loan pipeline. The severity of
the 1983 adjustment--real consumption 72 lower, real investment 15? down-
-put the stabilization program on track again and sharply improved the
external accounts. But the fiscal situation deteriorated.
1.12     A recovery attempt  in  1984  proved  unsustainable.  Imports rose
172, and the current account deficit again reached 10t of GDP. An ensuing
devaluation and an increase in import tariffs from 20? to 35? failed to
reduce the need for more foreign funds.
1.13     In early 1985 a new economic  team  took charge. Despite the com-
pression of income and imports (452 since 1981) and steady growth in export
volumes, Chile still required significant capital inflows. Copper, even at
very low prices, still provided more than 502 of export earnings. Chile's
foreign debt of US$20 billion equaled its GDP and was five times the value
of its merchandise exports.   The  economic  agenda also included  recovery
from extremely low levels of domestic savings and investment, as well as
Improvement in bank and corporate finances.
1.14     As the Government  decisively  addressed  its agenda, the interna-
tional institutions began to support the adjustment effort in the medium
term.  A US$2 billion package was  assembled:   an SDR 750 million ?2"W from
the IMF, the Bank's US$250 million SAL I (with the possibility of
successive SALs), and US$1.1 billion in new money from creditor banks. The
financial and policy package was designed to redress the balance of pay-
ments imbalance, to increase savings sharply while reorienting investment,
and to rebuild the financial system.    The  conditions set by the Bank and
the IM? were previously agreed and mutually reinforcing: the IMF estab-
lished macroeconomic targets for the monetary, fiscal, and foreign sectors;
and the Bank set conditions for export promotion, savings mobilization, the
public investment program (PIP) financial rehabilitation, and employment
generation.   The  distribution  of  functions  between  these institutions
worked well and with quick effect in Chiles inflation dropped from 30? to
below 152? GDP grew at  over  52 annually; unemployment was halved, exports
expanded over 6? yearly; the  current account deficit fell sharply, invest-
ment and savings (private and public) increased; and debt ratios improved.
1.15     In 1986 and 1987 the Bank provided two more SALs, each in the same
amount of SAL I; thus US$750 million in Bank assistance was disbursed from



- 4-
1985 to 1988 in support of Chile's SAP. Priorities of the Bank's program
as it evolved are mentioned  in  Chapter  II.    SAL  II (1986) and SAL III
(1987) continued to press for orientation leading to self-sustaining, long-
term growth.
B. Appraisal
1.16     Policies implemented in April  1975--and the economic upswing that
followed, which in 1977 surpassed previous peaks--followed the predictions
of the monetary approach to the balance of payments as it was then
promulgated. Vision at the time overlooked some of the shortcomings of the
approach, and these later forced upon the approach a sudden end and very
costly corrections.
1.17     Thus, in early 1980  the  Bank foresaw continuous economic growth,
alleviation of extreme poverty, and full employment in Chile by 1985.
Instead, external and internal factors forced the country into its worst
depression in 50 years.
1.18     The flaws of the monetarist  model have subsequently been unveiled
(notably, in a 1982 World Bank seminar).l1 Among those significant in the
Chilean case were:
* the appreciation of the exchange rate, which led to a level
of imports that was unwarranted from a long-term perspec-
tive and to an unsustainable accumulation of foreign debt:
* the widely held belief that private foreign debt was only
the  creditors'  risk   and   did   not   pose  a  domestic
macroeconomic problem;
X   the  expectation  that  domestic  firms  could  adjust  and
survive the simultaneous effects of uphill competition with
imports and very high real interest rates.
1.19     Another unnoticed misconception  at  this  time  was the confusion
between market freedom and the absence of prudential rules in the financial
sector. This led to an unhealthy network of relations between banks and
enterprises--and to their later mutual collapse, with its high social
costs.
1.20     After the crisis detonated there was considerable delay in recog-
nizing the depth of the  financial  problems.    Only  In late 1982 did the
first quantitative estimates of its magnitude become available. There was
also a delay--shared with the world financial community in general--in

Liberalization and Stabilization Policies in Arsentina, Chile, and

Payments (Washington: World Bank, 1984).



understanding and spelling out  the  full Implications of the international
debt crisis. The debt crisis loomed over solutions from the onset of the
Chilean crisis In August 1982 until 1985.
1.21     Although the Bank kept up  its  routine monitoring of the Chilean
economy In the early 1980s, there are indications that the Bank's intensive
analytical involvement was only resumed In 1984 (in part because of the
Chilean authorities' reluctance to use official borrowing). The complemen-
tary role of the Bank and IMF in addressing the situation with a longer-
term perspective in 1984-85--the 5FF/SAL I financial and policy package was
a forerunner of the P.S. Baker Plan--deserves full credit.
II. DESIGN. InaLENTATION, AND IMPACT OF ADJUSTHMENT PROGRAMS
A. Design
2.01     The Government's Immdiate response  to  the 1982-83 crisis was ad
hoc, as if Chile were facing only short-term problems. By mid-1983 there
was increasing acknowledgment of the need for a coherent longer-term pro-
gram, and In early 1984 an initial three-year PIP was introduced and later
improved.
The Structural Adjustment Program (SAP)
2.02     The 1985-87  SAP made  consistent macroeconomic  projections and
specified the structural policy measures to reach three of its immediate
goals: to accelerate and diversify exports, to correct the savings-invest-
ment disequilibrium, and to alleviate financial stress. The question of
employment generation vas also tackled, but the scope for solving it was
limited.
2.03     By late 1986 the SAP's  initial phase  had been successful.  Full
implementation--and its effects, sustainable output and employment growth-
-was within reach of the economic team, provided that the world economy
kept expanding moderately and that trade restrictions did not worsen. A
distinct element of the SAP's second phase was more attention to the
recapitalization and reprivatization of banks and corporations. The other
priorities were an increase in public savings to 4.4 X of GDP, an austere
and efficient PIP, and the strengthening of export incentives and social
security programs.
2.04     By mid-1987 it was  clear  that Chile had adjusted by sacrificing
current consumption in favor of savings, servicing the foreign debt, and
long-term growth that would maintain creditworthiness despite one of the
heaviest debt service burdens in the hemisphere. If copper prices remained
low, and if the debt burden continued to absorb a third of export earnings
and more than half of domestic savings, there would be little scope for
changes in policy and room for only moderate increases in consumption. But
the SAP also entailed diversifying the economy away from copper and build-
ing new, dynamic comparative advantages while Jncreasing savings and



- 6 -
investment beyond traditional rates, and this could be accomplished only by
several years of the current policies and new patterns of savings and
investment. Thus the SAP's orientation was to maintain the framework of
economic policy and to emphasize long-term capital markets, social securi-
ty, and health, which affected its social sustainability.
B. SAL I (2625-CH, 25 October 1985)
2.05     SAL I was  part  of  a  US$2  billion  financial package that also
included a three-year, SDR 750 million EFP and US$1.1 billion in new money
from commercial banks.21 Chile was able to reschedule amortizations with
financial and official creditors falling due in 1985 and 1986 (US$120
million). SAL I's aim was to support the Chilean Government's 1985-87
program of economic adjustmefiLt  and  recovery.   It stressed the correction
balance of payments disequilibria while alleviating the impact on growth
and productive employment by stimulating exports, increasing domestic
savings, reactivating the private sector, and capitalizing the banking
sector.
2.06     The main areas covered by the  SAP in the medium-term were, first,
to strengthen incentives for noncopper exports and, second, to increase
public savings and the efficiency of the PIP and to ameliorate banking and
corporate finances.   Complementary  studies  to improve public management,
state enterprise divestment, employment creation, export assistance, and
forestry development programs would be partially financed by the Bank's
prior Public Sector Management Technical Assistance Loan (TAL 2504-CH,
April 1985). The terms of SAL I were repayment in 15 years (including
three years grace) and disbursement in two tranches: half upon effective-
ness and half after a performance review within six months of effective-
ness. It could be used to finance any imports except luxury and military
goods.
Export Promotion Program
2.07     Chile made  important  adjustments  to  its  export  incentives in
1983-84. Poor price prospects for its prim.mry exports made expansion of
noncopper exports a top  priority.    The  program  planned to achieve this
through the reduction of import tariffs, a real exchange rate attractive
for export-oriented investment, coordination of investments in forestry and
energy, a larger  role  for  PROCHIDU    (the  Government's export assistance
agency) in the promotion of small producers' exportables, and stabilization
of the effects of copper market fluctuations. Following their pledges of
free trade and low and uniform import tariffs, the authorities reduced
tariffs to 202 and vowed to apply anti-dumping surcharges only when unfair
trade practices were confirmed.
2.08     After a 252  real  devaluation  of  the  peso,  the government had
undertaken to maintain the real exchange rate stable throughout the three-
year SAP. An essential feature would be a Copper Stabilization Fund (CSF)
2/ SAL 1, in the amount of US$250 million, was accompanied by a US$300
million B-Loan, half of which was guaranteed by the Bank.



to  resist  the  exchange   rate  appreciation  (depreciation)  and  demand
pressures that arise when volatile copper prices jump (decline). Although
direct export incentives were difficult to institute because of the
limitation on fiscal resources for subsidies, the administration had
strengthened export stimuli by various tax and credit measures and was
preparing an insurance system to reduce the risk of exporters' opening new
markets as well as legislation to develop export insurance firms. PROCHILE
was being reoriented to organize small-and medium-size exporters, to
support reaching new markets, to promote and coordinate participation in
international  trade  fairs,  and   to  identify--and  analyze  and  define
incentives for--nontraditional exports and potential export goods and their
quality improvement.
2.09     A high-level  public/private  task  force  had  been  appointed to
develop and implement public and private investments for high-potential,
rapid expansion of forestry exports. Only moderate increases were expected
in copper prices. The government strategy was to promote only a moderate
rise in CODELCO's (the Chilean State Copper Corporation) export production,
from 20 to 22? by 1996, and to open up high-potential ore bodies to private
investors.   As  for  import  substitution,  the  Government  was trying to
attract private investors into package deals linking concession rights in
the Magellan oil fields with exploration obligations in the Precordillera
region. The Government had also received International Finance Corporation
(IPC) support for an open-pit coal mine in the Magellan area and had agreed
with private investors for the construction of a methanol processing plant.
To discourage inefficient import substitution, the authorities had reduced
reference price bands for wheat, oilseeds, and sugar and considered further
reducing sugar price supports in 1986.
Savings Mobilization and the PIP
2.10     While substantial new  investment was  needed  for the economy to
grow, interest payments on the external debt would be absorbing much of
Chile's savings for  years  aheads    thus  the need  to increase domestic
saving. The major effort would be borne by the public sector, which might
have to service part of the private sector's foreign obligations (which the
Government had  guaranteed).    Challenged  by  the  impact  of  the social
security reform (22 or more of GDP), the high share of social expenditures
(30? of the total), the income tax reform, and the financial relief of the
banking system, the government would resort to value-added and luxury goods
taxes, sales of assets (pension plan administrators--AFPs--were to invest
in their purchases) and expenditure  austerity.   Some of the measures were
expected to mobilize private savings; e.g., AFPs would soon invest up to 42
of GDP, and income tax reforms would amount to 0.6? of GDP.

A three-year PIP (to avoid the  stop-go of annual programs) was directed to
promote exports and to remove bottlenecks affecting private investment
growth. Thus, the PIP's priorities were copper expansion, energy invest-
ments, and infrastructure to export and to generate jobs in agriculture,
forestry, and selected industrial activities. Equally important, following
a World Bank review, several investment projects were eliminated from the
PIP (the Santiago subway, large irrigation projects) in favor of higher
priorities (road maintenance, small and fast irrigation rehabilitation).
3inancial Rehabilitation
2.12     To deal with the joint crisis of Chile's business firms and banks,
the Central Bank during 1982-84 had implemented across-the-board debt-
rescheduling programs, a preferential exchange rate system, and subsidized
swap operations. The Government had been forced to guarantee foreign debts
of the private financial sector.   This made it necessary to distribute the
losses of the Chilean financial system--then at least US$3.5 billion-
-entirely within the country, with major macroeconomic repercussions. The
Government sustained massive losses from transfers and commitments to
continue some of the guarantees in the future. An unsolved issue remained:
where would the resources come from to pay for these losses beyond 1987
(1985-86 would be covered by foreign borrowing).
2.13     The solution called for limiting  the subsidies to banks and finms
and finding resources to pay for the past subsidies, which up to that point
had been financed by  issuing  Central  Bank  notes.    In July 1985 it was
announced that the preferential exchange rate programs and currency swap
operations would be phased out by December 1986, reducing the cost of these
programs from 42 of GDP in 1984 to 1.52 of GDP in 1986. To improve
repayment performance of bad loans, the generalized reprogramming of



- 9 -
domestic loans would end by November 1985. The authorities also planned to
strengthen prudential legislation affecting companies and banks and the
supervision of the latter.
2.14     To recapitalize the  intervened banks,  legislation in April 1985
established that Government participation in the capital of such banks
should not exceed 491, of which at least one-fifth would be sold annually
to the private sector.   More  important,  the  Central Bank bought the bad
loans from the banks at face value, but ordered that the banks would not be
allowed to pay dividends on the shares of original capital until the entire
bad loan portfolio had been repurchased.
Employment
2.15     Although there were indications of a more elastic relation between
output and employment, the low economic growth expected for 1985-87 made
indispensable the continuation of the emergency employment programs (EEPs)
whose cost was 1S of GDP.  The government wanted to enhance the social and
productive aspects of these programs  and  it intended to undertake a labor
study toward this end.
C. SAL 1I (2767 CH, 21 November 1985)
2.16     At the  time  of  SAL  II's  approval,  the  steering committee of
Chile's creditor banks had accepted the World Bank's insistence that
commercial  creditors  should   finance   the  remaining  foreign  eschange
requirements of the  country  for  1987.   The  precise  amount would be
estimated by  December 1986.   The  Bank  was also exploring cofinancing
possibilities vith the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
2.17     The objectives of  SAL  II were  to  support the government's SAP
along the lines of SAL It  to strengthen incentives for noncopper exports,
to increase public savings and the efficiency and impact of public expendi-
tures, and to improve  banking  and  corporate  finances, with the emphasis
this time on the latter.    Complementary  studies to improve health sector
management, employment generation, export assistance programs, and a fores-
try development program would be partially financed by a previous TAL from
the Bank. The terms  of  SAL  I1  were  extended  to repayment in 17 years
(including four years grace) and disbursement  of the US$250 million in two
tranches: "front-loading' of US$150 million upon effectiveness, and US$100
million after a performance review within  six months of effectiveness. As
before, the new  SAL  could  finance  any  imports but luxury and military
goods.
Financial Rehabilitation
2.18     To develop an  efficient  and  safe  capital market,  in 1986 the
Government was taking measures to recapitalize private firms (through case
by case renegotiations of their debts) to recapitalize the banking system,
to reprivatize the intervened banks and companies, and to strengthen the
supervisory and legal framework of the capital market and the financial



- 10 -
sector. The authotities expected that by end-1986 all viable firms would
have completed financial arrangements.   By August 1986 many of the inter-
vened enterprises had  been  sold,  and  the  comissions  handling the two
largest holdings, COPEC and  CCU, were  to  be  dissolved when the sale of
their companies was completed.   By  the  same date the government had sold
two Intervened banks, merged the other three into two (60? of whose stock
was already private); the administration of these banks was to become
private by end-1986. The banking system again had positive equity capital;
the annual cost of the bailout was about US$100 million, to be shared by
the Central Bank and old  shareholders.   The legislature was considering a
new baitking law, the financial situation of corporations approached normal-
ity, and the stock exchange recovered.    But to contain the Central Bank's
losses, the authorities would end the provision of subsidies and toughen
its stand with private banks.
Savings Mobilization
2.19     Public revenues were expected to decline by 22 of GDP in 1986, the
net result of the continuation of the tax reform and depressed interna-
tional oil and copper prices.   But  sales of public enterprises would pro-
vide US$100 million, and expenditures were to drop by 3.52 of GDP because
of wage restraint and reductions in unemployment and social (mostly health)
programs. The three-year PIP took account of reconstruction works for the
March 1985 earthquake and emphasized infrastructure projects for private
investments (e.g., transportation) and upgrading production in public
enterprises. Tax reforms, the growth of pension funds, the strengthening
and reform of the banking system, and the consolidation of the stock
exchange, it was thought, would stimulate private savings. The scope for
debt purchases was expanded in May 1986; such measures, together with a
favorable climate for foreign investment and privatization, were intended
to increase both direct foreign investment and local savings.
Exnort Promotion
2.20     The Government had renewed its commitment to maintain low and even
import tariffs (since June 1986 they were fixed by law) and a constant real
exchange rate throughout  1986-87.    It  also  planned to modify operating
procedures to stimulate further small- and medium-size exporters. The
administration would define its investment strategy and policy for fores-
try--of high export potential--upon a commission's report that was due in
December 1986. Export-oriented foreign investment was already under way in
minerals (methanol, copper, mixed salts).
Social Poiicies
2.21     The authorities planned to perfect targeting of its social expend-
itures.  In 1986 it would  decentralize  administration of its main social
programs. Still, it was probable that low investment in health would
decrease access to health facilities, with long-term effects. A study due
in March 1987 was to provide the  basis for a medium-term strategy.  If GDP
grew at 5  in 1986, expenditures  on  EEPs could be reduced, but these pro-
grams would last at least 3 more  years.  Studies under the Bank's TAL will
shed light on the productivity of these programs.



- 11 -
D. SAL III (2892-CH, 16 December 1987)
2.22     When SAL III was approved,  the  SAP financing for 1988 was fairly
well set as a result of Chile's 1987 negotiations with its foreign credi-
tors to cover 1987 and 1988. The international banks had agreed to Oretim-
ing' and 'repricing' interest payments and spreads, to restructuring loans
for US$12.5 billion (with four years grace), and to extend US$1.7 billion
in short-term credits. The Paris Club had also refinanced loans to the
public sector.
2.23     The purpose of SAL III was to continue support of the Government's
SAPs to maintain the sound framework for economic policy and to reinforce
its social sustainability, with emphasis on long-term capital markets, and
on social security and health. SAL 1I1, in the same amount and in the same
terms as SAL II, was to be disbursed in two equal tranches--the first upon
effectiveness, and the second after a performance review within 12 months
of effectiveness. The SAP still had its risks: inability to generate
savings and investment, adverse terms of trade, and world interest rates,
and insufficient access to foreign capital, which could result in unsatis-
factory growth or impede  debt  servicing.   Domestic political uncertainty
could also affect private investment.
Financial Rehabilitation
2.24     The aithorities would  continue  reconstruction  of the financial
system, enforring collections of previously reprogrammed debts and re-
stricting pa'aents of profits to  precrisis owners who still had repurchase
obligations with the Central Bank. It would also augment its monitoring of
the collection of debts sold to the Central Bank, improve banks' efficiency
to speed up their loan repurchases from the Central Bank, and publicize the
low limits on State guarantees to depositors. Once rehabilitation of the
banking system was completed, the authorities would focus on diversifying
the portfolio and channeling funds of institutional savers (for example,
AhPs, which handle 60S of private savings) into equity and private debt.
2.25     To stimulate capital  markets,  the  Government's program included
fiscal measures to encourage equity investment and the growth of intermedi-
ation, changes in the all-important risk classification procedures, and
liberalizing the restrictions on institutional savers that had impeded
investments of acceptable risk.
Social Sectors
2.26     To improve the operation of  the  social security system, the Gov-
ernment intended to protect the security of the pension funds (tightening
regulatory control of their investments, and affirming the principles of
portfolio management); to increase the efficiency of the system (unifying
the collection of contributions and increasing transparency to promote
competition); to extend its long-term coverage (ensuring the continuation
of disability and survival insurance to the unemployed or part-time workers
and encouraging affiliation of the self-employed); and to enhance the
acceptance of the program (by simplified commission structures, easier



- 12 -
choice of companies, voluntary payroll deduction, and reduction of fixed
fees). Public current nonpersonnel outlays for health care would rise by
151 in real terms  in  1988.    To  increase  the  output for this level of
expenditure, the authorities would consolidate the progress made in
preventive health care and extend it to cover chronic diseases and would
increase the efficiency of  the  decentralized  system.   To redress market
imperfections in operation of the rapidly expanding public health insurance
plans (ISAPRE8), the Government would strengthen their regulation and
clarify their respective role within the national health system.
Macroeconomic and Export Promotion Policies
2.27     SAL III would be  important in consolidating macroeconomic adjust-
ment policies in light of the politics surrounding the 1988 plesbicite-
-that is. only moderate increases in domestic consumption, diversification
into new exports, and efficient import substitution. To uphold competi-
tiveness, the Government would maintain and strengthen the CSF--to become
active in 1987:3--by narrowing its price bands and abandoning the annual
averaging procedures. The Government would also preserve the real exchange
rate by daily nominal devaluations, would review the export incentive
framework if nontraditional exports failed to grow in real terms as
planned, and would adequately disclose that foreign financing was forthcom-
ing. The authorities had also taken measures to offset some effects of the
202 uniform tariff. Finally, the Government intended to promote nontradi-
tional exports actively through an export insurance program (unsubsidized
and run by specialized private firms) and to provide small firms with
export financing (through creation of a fund to extend partial public guar-
antees for investment credits and to cover risks of working capital loans).
Noncopper exports were projected to grow at 6-82 annually in real terms.
Public Finance and Investments
2.28     The Government would increase public savings  to 5Z of GDP in 1988
(from 4.8 and 4.4 in previous years) and would limit the overall public
deficit to 1.61 of GDP in 1987 and less in 1988. The monetary and fiscal
program would absorb the cost of recapitalizing the banking system. The
PIP would amount to 7.51 of GDP.  The PIP's US$1.3 billion budget appeared
not to have major distortions, and minor changes had been made at the
Bank's suggestion (in housing and  petroleum).    The Bank would review the
PIP's progress with the Chilean authorities.
E. Aipraisal of SALs' ConceDt and Design
2.29     The Government's  main  thrust  of  the  response  to the economic
crisis was to  confront  short-term  problems.   The  design of policy was
adapted in the search for stability and relief of payments imbalances. The
economic policy framework was agreed with the IMF and incorporated condi-
tionalities required for the Fund's financial assistance. The two-year IMF
Stand-by arrangements for 1983-84 paved the way for the subsequent EFF and
two Compensatory Financing Facility (CPF) purchases in 1983 and 1985.



- 13 -
2.30     The economic policies  put  forward  underwent  several shifts and
setbacks in 1983-84--the result of  escalations  of the economic and finan-
cial crisis, oan one hand, and of the different views of successive economic
cabinets and government Insiders, on  the  other.   The main feature of the
1982-84 programs was the lack of quantified medium-term objectives. It was
not until 1985 that a medium-term scenario was envisaged, when the chances
of structural adjustment began to look more solid. The size of the foreign
debt became an important issue, and the vulnerability of the Chilean econ-
omy to external shocks became the cornerstone of the SAP. The 1983-84
transition period saw problems in policy design and implementation. Unan-
ticipated effects of the severe financial crisis and inadequate handling of
the exchange rate raised a considerable appreciation of the peso. The
program was conceived to counteract insufficient demand and a 15? unemploy-
ment rate and also included a contingency investment plan equivalent to
0.8? of CDP that could be activated in the second balf of 1984. So long as
the evolution of demand was positive, the contingency plan was not put in
operation. In the 1984 IMF agreement there was no formal monitoring of the
Central Bank's operational deficit and no limit to the short-term external
debt.
2.31     The program started in  1985  by  a  new economic team changed the
design of policy. On  the whole, more emphasis was placed on medium-term
solutions and new goals, and measures were agreed both with the IMF, which
continued supplying financial support and monitoring and with the World
Bank, which contributed to consolidation of the financial rehabilitation,
export incentives, public sector management, and so on while providing and
catalyzing additional finace. Both types of financial support shared the
objectives of stabilization and structural adjustment, but their condition-
alities did not necessarily overlap.    The IMF was interested in macroeco-
nomic policies and in reforming the exchange rate and trade areas to re-
store market freedom and  efficiency.    The  Bank was oriented more toward
export incentives, public sector resource management, financial rehabilita-
tion, and reprivatization. Targets of the Government program produced for
1985 were subject  to  further  revisions  depending on performance of the
economy.
2.32     The performance criteria were  modified  to gain more flexibility.
In the 1983-84 programs they were set for 12-month calendar periods. The
conditions in 1985 set the performance criteria for six-month periods. The
second tranche of SAL I could be released only after review of performance
and conditionalities six months  after  effectiveness.    The targets were
often reviewed, and it was the IMP staff's contention that the deviations
between actual and programmed outcomes reflected the best efforts of the
country to adjust its economy.    The validity of performance tests to re-
orient economic policy was one of the main concerns of the monitoring
activity. The I)P was evaluating performance in the field and kept the
Bank informed on the subject. Annual program targets established under the
EEF agreement were adapted to take account of changes and deviations from
original assumptions without  altering  medium-term  objectives.   The main
goals were to influence the rate of growth of GDP, the rate of inflation
(usually measured by the consumer price index, CPI), the current account



- 14 -
balance both in U.S. dollars and as a percentage of GDP. and the balance of
payments and fiscal balance as a proportion of GDP.
2.33     The SAP incorporated  contingency  elements  for more flexibility.
The PIP included a contingency item of O.52 of GDP to be activated during
the second half of the year if private expenditure dropped or if the gov-
ernment obtained long-term foreign finance in an amount higher than pro-
grammed. The 1986 program introduced the CS?, which was one of the condi-
tionalities of the Bank's SALs.   This  fund was created as a contingency
against unforeseen deviations in the copper price. The CSP mechanism was
in full operation by the beginning of 1988, when the reference price for
copper was established as a medium-term price rather than a projected price
for a given period.
2.34     The key contribution of the Bank since late 1984 was two-folds  to
instill a medium-term dimension and approach in economic policy and to make
such policy possible through direct and catalytic effects on financing. It
is generally recognized that successive short-term policies would have
doomed the adjustment effort to failure.   The permanent emphasis on export
promotion and savings mobilization and investment was well placed to alle-
viate the then most strategic wants of the economy.
2.35     Although the contribution of SAL II was less dramatic than that of
its predecessor, it was equally necessary to sustain the SAP. The main
additional emphasis was on cutting the terms and costs of financial reha-
bilitation, in which it succeeded. The orientation of SAL III--fast action
in the social sectors--while intended to balance the whole package, is more
disputed in some of its effects than were the earlier SALs (see Chapter
IV).
F. Implementation
Conditionalities and Performance
2.36     Chile was favored in that its previous stabilization policies were
applied in the context of different types of external finance obtained from
other international sources, particularly the IMF. This experience signif-
icantly reduced the number of conditionalities required in the granting of
the SALs. In order to evaluate results, however, the Bank's loans were
given in two tranches--the first upon effectiveness, and the second upon
compliance with the second-tranche conditionalities.
SAL I
2.37     The conditionalities for -the  release  of  SAL I's second tranche
were related to the five main objectives of the SAP.
2.38     Export Promotion.  The Government had already shown its commitment
to a realistic export incentive system by a 25? real devaluation of the
exchange rate (between September 1984 and July 1985) and a reduction of
import tariffs from 252 to a 202 even rate. Other anti-export biases had



- 15 -
been removed, and additional incentives had been provided to support new
exports, primarily from small and medium-sized producers. Before release
of the second tranche it was requireds
*    to revise Chile's export stimuli, to improve 1985 noncopper
export performance, and, if the projected 61 real growth
was not achieved, to change the incentives to the satisfac-
tion of the World Banks
*    to place in effect, by January  1, 1986, a CSF to stabilize
the fiscal revenues from CODELCO's exports.
2.39     Public PFinuces.  The SAP's priorities were to limit the growth of
public current expenditure, to follow up the PIP carefully. and to improve
the cost effectiveness of state  companies.   The public savings goals were
31 of GDP for 1985 and 4.5Z of GDP for 1986. A trimmed-down and export-
oriented PIP had been published.    The  conditions for disbursement of the
second tranche vere:
*    satisfactory  execution  of   the  1985  public  investment
budget;
*    review and agreement on a 1986 public sector budget;
*    introduction of fiscal measures  to achieve public savings
of about 4.51 of projected 1986 GDP.
An additional requirement was preparation of an action plan to improve
public institutions management.
2.40     Financial Rehabilitation.  To contain the losses from Central Bank
transfers, the Government had announced several measures to encourage the
restructuring or bankruptcy of the remaining insolvent firms--which were
the banks' debtors--and the recovery, with interested ownership, of finan-
cial entities' viable  financial  structures.    The  authorities, and Bank
staff had clearly begun to estimate more precisely future losses and their
monetary and fiscal consequences.   The  conditions for second tranche dis-
bursement in this regard were:
*    review of progress on  the bank capitalization programs and
of financial flows between those entities and the Central
Bank;
e    agreement on a program to share, within the domestic econo-
my, local banks' asset losses (contingent on a review of
the 1985 loan portfolio performance of commercial banks);
*    executive approval  of  satisfactory  legislation governing
transparency of bank and corporate ownership;



- 16 -
*    an end to the general  rescheduling of loans extended to or
by financial entities, a freeze on new concessional credit
lines for this purpose, the phasing out (by December 1986)
of the preferential exchange rate program, and elimination
of subsidized currency map operations.
2.41     Employment Generation.  Since  the  projected annual GDP growth of
3S would generate an employment growth rate of 2.5 and the labor force was
increasing 22 yearly, the unemployed and UEP beneficiaries would still be
162 of the work force by 1990, forcing maintenance of the UEPs. In 1985
the government began nine pilot programs to lmprove the efficiency and
reduce the costs of EEPs.    Two  studies,  under  the World Bank's Public
Sector Management TAL, were to assess employment policies and programs-
-specifically, cost-effective reforms, reduction of the program of miniMUM
employment (PEN) and the program of employment for heads of families
(POJH), and employment generation.
2.42     Other Areas.  Other  conditions  to  trigger the second tranche of
SAL I were as follows:
-    development of a forestry plan;
-    satisfactory progress on the other studies under the Public
Sector Management  TAL:    medium-term  fiscal and monetary
projections, actions to increase exports by small- and
medium-scale producers, public firm management, and meas-
ures for local sugar prices to reflect international prices
in the long run.
SAL II
2.43     The conditionalities of SAL  II  naturally  reflected the goals of
the SAP and SAL I. While these objectives are roughly the same as in SAL
I, their relative emphasis and scope varied over time.
2.44     Financial Rehabilitation.  Recapitalization  of the financial sys-
tem was largely completed; the restructuring process was expected to last
two more years because of the complexity of negotiations. What was needed
was to move from the achieved short-term restoration of solvency to ensur-
ing the system's long-term stability.  Thus, the commitments for the second
tranche of SAL II to become operational weres
*    to make substantial progress  in the program for recapital-
izing the banking system;
*    to show that the intervened banks were or would be able to
generate operational profits by July 31, 1986 and to reach
a debt-equity ratio between 15sl and 18:1 (this would en-
tail additional purchases of US$250 million in substandard
portfolios by the Central Bank; these would not mean losses
for the Central Bank but, in principle, only an annual
subsidy of 0.1? of GDP);



- 17 -
*    to strengthen the monitory functions of the Superintendency
of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF)--the asset qual-
ity of banks would be monitored by the bank, and both the
commercial banks" performance and portfolio would be ana-
lyzed over time;
*    to put into effect a  system of bank deposit insurance--the
guarantee fund for sight deposits would be based on new
reserve requirements of twice the net worth of commercial
banks, supplemented by the Central Bank; specifically, by
June 30, 1987 a complete guarantee for deposits up to
US$2,000 would be operative;
*    to formulate a fiscal  and monetary program for absorption
of costs incurred by the Central Bank in recapitalizing the
banking system (new projections and contingency plans for
alternative interest rate forecasts);
*    to eliminate the remaining net  cost to the Central Bank of
the deposit scheme for the restructured external debt of
the financial sector;
*    to phase out  the  preferential  exchange  rate program for
foreign currency debts larger than US$50,000.
2.45     Public Finances.   Disbursement  of  the  second  tranche would be
conditional upont
*    a satisfactory execution of the 1986 PIP;
*    preparation of  a  1987-89  PIP within  a budget including
Central Bank operations;
*    putting into effect measures  to  raise  public savings to
4.71 of GDP in 1987 (with a target of 5.51 of GDP by 1990);
*    securing enough external financing  to  close the 1987 bal-
ance of payments.
2.46     Export Promotion. The measures  already taken had ended specula-
tion about the Government's commitment to an open and free economy and
promised to induce more private investment in export-oriented and efficient
import substitution activities. Release of the second tranche was condi-
tional on:
*    maintenance of the CSF;
*    revlew of 1986 noncopper  export performance  and, if the
projected 61 real growth was not achieved, satisfactory
modification of the incentive structure.



- 18 -
2.47     Social Programs.  The Government  had started to reverse the nega-
tive effects of the SAP on investment and maintenance of health infrastruc-
ture, but a balanced program would be needed in the future. The condition-
alities for making the second tranche operational were satisfactory prog-
ress ons
*    assessing the efficiency of the SEP's (the PEM had become a
pure income subsidy mechanism); and
*    evaluating the main management issues of the health sector.
Both studies would have the auspices of the Bank's Sector
Public Management TAL.
2.48     Other Areas.   Other  conditions  for second tranche disbursements
were:
*    preparation of an  action  plan  and  a preliminary 1988-90
investment program for forestry;
*    evaluation of the impact of private pension funds on domes-
tic savings;
*    evaluation of the  efficiency  of public enterprise manage-
ment.
SAL III
2.49     SAL III's set conditions--both for  the presentation to the Bank's
Executive Board and for the second tranche disbursement--concerned four
areas that corresponded roughly to those of the previous SALs.
2.50     Macroeconomic  and Export  Promotion  Policies.    The government
intended to resist demands for increased consumption and pressures to
change  policies:    to maintain  Chile's  competitiveness  in traditional
exports and in import substituting activities, to offset some effects of
the 202 uniform tariff, and to promote nontraditional exports. The condi-
tions to activate the second tranche of SAL III weres
*    to strengthen  the  CSF,  which would  have received US$35
million in the second part of 1988, by narrowing the band
around  the  reference   price  from US$O.0OS-US$0.125  to
US$0.04-US$O.lO, and by abandoning the annual averaging
procedure;
*    to maintain the real  effective  exchange rate through fre-
quent and regular adjustments in the nominal exchange rate;
*    to review noncopper export performance  and,  if the real
growth projection for 1988 failed to reach 72, to modify
the incentive structure to further increase exports;
*    to prove the adequacy of the external financial program.



_ 19 -
2.51     The Government would also permit  indirect exporters access to the
benefits of capital goods purchases under decree law 1226 and change
finance decree 409 to grant exporters drawbacks, independently of who
imported the  inputs.    In  addition,  the  authorities would establish a
private, unsubsidized export credit insurance system (operated by special-
ized firms) and would give small and medium-size companies partial (up to
501) guarantees for investment credits and working capital loans (up to
US$150,000). The State Bank would operate a US$4.4 million fund for this
purpose. These measures were conditions for the Bank staff's Board presen-
tation of SAL III. Other Board presentation requirements were to maintain
the CSF and the real effective exchange rate and to modify the incentive
framework if real noncopper exports grew less than 61 in 1987.
2.52     Public Finances and Investments.  The second tranche conditionali-
ties in this area weres
*    to restrain public  expenditures  so  as  to limit the 1988
nonfinancial public sector deficit to 1.6Z of GDP in 1988;
*    to increase public savings to 52  of GDP in 1988 (from 4.8Z
in 1987 and 4.4Z in 1986);
*    to carry out  satisfactorily  the  1987  and 1988 PIPs (the
latter was still under some discussion);
*    to prepare a 1988-90 PIP of 7.51 of GDP each year.
2.53     Financial Rehabilitation.  To  complete  its rehabilitation of the
banking system, the Government was augmenting its monitoring of the collec-
tion of debts sold to the Central Bank and was trying to improve the effi-
ciency of banks in accelerating repurchases of bad portfolios sold to the
Central Bank. The Government would also make clearer to depositors the low
limits of State guarantees.   These were conditions for board presentation.
Other requirements were to amend decree law 2500 to permit enhanced partic-
ipation of pension funds In equity markets and to strengthen the regulation
of insurance companies and mutual funds (with prudential guidelines for
portfolio diversification and limits to related-party investments). The
attention was turning to medium-time financial issues affecting savings and
investment. The second tranche conditionalities weres
*    to encourage capital (particularly equity) markets through:
-    revisions in the tax  treatment of income from securi-
ties--more symmetrical treatment of capital gains and
losses in quoted stock transactions, deductions of
purchases of mutual funds subscribing primary issues,
and so on, and
-    a reduction by a half  in  the  2.42 stamp tax rate on
credit and bond issues;



-20-
*    to improve the system of risk classification of securities,
in order to stimulate the capital markets, by increasing
the number of companies vhose paper the private pension
funds would be allowed to purchase;
*    to carry out studies  on  efficiency and competition in the
finamcial system, broadening the range of its instruments
and encouraging open corporations.
The Government was also toughening prudential regulations in securities
markets  and  allowing   greater  market  participation  by  institutional
investors.
2.54     Social Sectors.   The  social  security  and health programs were
essential both for the sustainability of the SAP and for the poor. In the
first instance, the administration intended to protect the security of the
pension funds, to increase the efficiency and long-term coverage of the
system, and to enhance the  program's  acceptance.   In the second, it pur-
ported to increase current nonpersonnel outlays by 152 in 1988 and to raise
productivity. The conditionalities to release the second tranche weres
*    to change administrative  procedures  in  order to increase
the collection of social security contributions, unifying
and simplifying procedures before end-1988;
*    to carry out a study on:
?    the viability of  augmenting  affiliation (it was then
251) of the self-employed (202 of the work force) to
the social security system vis-a-vis support from the
fiscal budget, and
ways to reduce the  operating costs of private pension
funds, and to diminish or elimnate fees, which
resulted in low-income contributors receiving 15-171
less in payouts than high-income contributors;
*    to increase  public  understanding  of the social security
reforms by facilitating entry (simpler commission struc-
tures) and the choice of insurance companies; other actions
foreseen by the authoriti4s were to reduce the capital
requirements for establishing an APP from US$330.000 to
US$83,000, to encourage funds for individual firms, and to
introduce voluntary savings accounts (to be managed by the
APPs) set up through automatic payroll deduction;
*    to strengthen preventive health care programs (for adults),
including coverage  of chronic  diseases (smoking-related,
cervical and breast cancer, cardiovascular diseases), and
to tax cigarette advertisement on top of the sales tax
(then 69X);



- 21 -
*    to improve  cost  contaiament  and  accountlng,  as well as
user's fee collection, by the decentralized public health
system and to streamline Its management;
*    to strengthen the  regulatory  framework for private health
insurance and to clarify the rules for transactions between
the public health system and private insurers;
*    to undertake  a  program  to  rehabilitate public hospitals
(252 of machinery and equipment was out of order) starting
January 1, 1989.
G. Appraisal of Imolementation
2.55     The short-term objective of  encouraging  the maximum expansion of
economic activity compatible with a gradual decline of external financial
resources was given a concrete form in the macroeconomic program of 1985-88
supported by the ITF's mF.    The long-term objective of consolidating the
conditions for sustained growth through the SAP was supported mainly by the
World Bank's SALs I (1985-86), II (1986-87), and III (1987-88). The
program attracted and received support from the international creditors
banks and official creditor agencies through negotiations in 1985, 1987 and
1988. As will be seen in this subsection, the implementation of the three
SALs was successful to a high degree.
Implementation of the SAP
2.56     The SAP, initiated in 1985, was successfully carried out.  Targets
were surpassed, and necessary readjustments were made to maintain the
direction of economic policy on a reasonable track. The main goals under
MFl surveillance were the rate of GDP growth, the inflation rate, the ratio
of the current account balance to GDP, the balance of payments, and the
ratio of the fiscal deficit to GDP.  The 1985 program was revised yearly,
with the first revision taking place in early 1986. Since then, new revi-
sions were made in each following year. Those modifications consisted in
introducing actual data to the performance criteria and projecting the
target for the following years by taking account of new developments.
2.57     GDP Growth. As far as GDP growth was concerned, higher rates than
expected were experienced with the exception of 1985, when GDP grew 2.41
(against the projection of 31).  In  the following years, actual growth of
output surpassed targets, and this meant an upward revision of the future
rates (Table 2.2).

2.58     Inflation.  Slowing inflation was  another important target.  The
1985 program foresaw a 5Z reduction yearly during 1986 and 1987 and a 32
fall in 1988. In 1985 actual inflation, measured by CPI, was 1.4S above
the planned rate. On this matter the 1986 and 1987 revisions lowered the
targets (Table 2.3).    In  1987  the  rate  of  inflation slipped away and
reached 21.SZ; nearly 82 above the last revision.

2.59     Current Account Deficit.    The program Increasingly overestimated
the current account deficit  over  time  (Table  2.4).   In 1985 the actual
deficit was US$27 million below the programmed figure. In 1988 the differ-
ence amounted to US$383 million.   The current account deficit as a propor-
tion of GDP was underestimated in 1985-86 and overestimated in the two
following years. The 1986 revisions of the program were pessimistic, par-
ticularly for 1986 and 1987.    Later  adjustments  to reality proved to be
very close to the 1985 original forecasts.

2.60     Balance of Payments.    Performance  here  also  showed  a need to
readjust the targets (Table 2.5).    Initially  a US$27 million surplus was
expected in 1985, higher than the actual US$4 million. Revisions of the
program in 1986 and 1987 increased the values of the surplus: experience
showed a larger amount in 1986 and a similar negative figure a year later.
In 1988 the situation changed again and the overall balance reached US$838
million, reflecting an improvement in the outlook for exports, lower
interest rates, and better than expected results of debt conversion.

2.61     Fiscal Deficit/GDP Ratio.    Targets  for  this measure were also
revised (Table 2.6).31 The change occurred because of the utilization of
contingency investment plans and foreign finance to reconstruct damages
caused by the March 1985 earthquake. The contingency investment program in
1985 was 0.5Z of GDP and the deficit was planned to be 1.8? of GDP in 1986.
At the beginning of that year the target was corrected to 2.32. The same
happened for the target of 3.1Z of GDP for 1985, which was revised in
January 1986. This implied the activation of 0.1? of GDP from the contin-
gency plan started in 1985.   This  activation was triggered by additional
foreign financial assistance from the Bank and the IDB.

2.62     Macroeconomic policies. Macroeconomic policies under the SAP were
sounder than In 1983-84. The program was directed to reverse the decline
of private savings and anti-export biases.    The real rate of interest was
positive. For the years 1985, 1986 and 1987, the effective annual rates of
interest for short-ternm deposits were'31.6?, 18.92 and 25.12, respectively;
given Inflation rates of 26.4?, 17.42, and 21.52 in those years, annual
real interest rates were positive but very mall: 4.12, 1.32, and 32. The
monetary program was consistent with efforts to reduce inflation and to
meet the balance of payments goals and this was complemented by a policy of
wage restraint in the public sector. The government did not interfere with
wage negotiations with the private sector.
Implementation of SAL I
2.63     Chile demonstrated its commitment to structural adjustments before
the SALs (See Sections II and III of the PCR). In the early 1980s the fall
in prices of copper and other major export commodities caused enormous
losses in Chile's earnings. The economic crisis of 1982-83 prompted deval-
uations that increased the indebtedness of the productive sector and sig-
nificantly constrained its ability to pay the debt. The financial system
was near collapse, and the State was forced to intervene in January 1983,
taking over the administration of various financial institutions. The
Government had to assist banks and firms in distress by granting loans and
providing guarantees. Nevertheless, difficulties were also an outcome of



- 26 -
past economic policies. The permissive liberalization process of the mid-
1970s led to an undue reliance on foreign loans and increased external
indebtedness. The latter leveled off when it amounted to roughly the size
of GDP. In 1984 the authorities recognized the need for structural adjust-
ments and elaborated, jointly with the World Bank, a three-year PIP.
2.64     The Chilean adjustment  efforts  were  significant and measures in
exbcange rates, tariffs, and the elimination of low-return projects in the
PIP induced the Bank to impose few conditionalities on a loan that would be
spent on imports. The adjustment program for SAL I was prepared by the
Ministries of Economy and Finance and the Central Bank and was presented to
the Bank in November 1984.  By  September 20, 1985, negotiations were com-
pleted, and in November 1985 effectiveness was to take place. The first
tranche was disbursed in December 1985, and the second tranche was released
in June 1986. Conditionalities for disbursement were described above. In
many cases they referred to studies rather than policy actions, since Chile
had already started to adopt strong adjustment measures. One of the most
important of these studies was the scheme for rehabilitation of the banking
system.
2.65     Export Promotion.  The  Government's  SAP for 1985-87 attempted to
correct the in balance of payments disequilibrium while trying to minimize
the impact on economic growth. The authorities expected that their actions
would produce GDP growth of  2-4X  in  1985, increasing to 3-5Z in 1986-87.
The pace of growth quickened in 1986, to 5.42, led by fishing (102), agri-
culture (8.7X), transportation (8.1X), and industry (82). The main factors
of growth were increases in  domestic  investment  and external trade.  The
objectives of the three-year program carried out by the Government were
amply met in 1986. The plan was built under realistic assumptions. Copper
prices were assumd to have a moderate upward trend starting from US$0.65 a
pound. Real interest rates were slowly decaying, to a 32 annual level by
the end of the decade.
2.66     The issues in export promotion were to diversify exports, encour-
age the development of efficient import substitution, accelerate mineral
exports, and improve Government support for nontraditional exports. The
measures taken by the Government included a strong initial devaluation in
1985 and, later, an exchange rate gradually adjusted in response to the
difference between domestic and  international  inflation.   Looking at the
past, there was a real devaluation of 702 between June 1982 and March 1985.
It continued: it was 462 in 1985-86. The import tariff reduction from 352
to 202 was started on February 1985 and completed by June 1985, one year
ahead of schedule. External trade was being freed by removal of quantita-
tive restrictions and by a low and even tariff. The administration's pro-
gram expected real growth in noncopper exports to be 62 a year so as to
realize a current account deficit of US$l billion by 1987. The expansion
that actually took place doubled the target, and the measures directed to
correct the balance of payments problems permitted attainment a current
account deficit of US$1.2 billion in 1987 (down from US$2.1 billion in
1984). Tariff reductions of 52 and 102 were introduced from March to July
1985. The price-band policy designed to level off changes in cereals and



- 27 -
oilseeds prices. which had been applied since 1983, was adjusted to corre-
spond with the tariff reductions in Harch 1986 for the 1986-87 agricultural
year. An assessment of the state sugar monopoly's competitiveness was
completed by 1986sl, and based on its results a price support was estab-
lished for sugar.
2.67     Exports also were promoted in July 1985 by a 1OX rebate on the net
earnings of minor exports and by adapting the rebate system to dampen the
impact of custom duties on exporters who imported inputs. The mechanism of
deferred payments of customs duties on the value of capital goods imported
for the production of exportable goods was also improved. The amount of
debt that the contracting exporter had with customs was now reduced by the
percentage that his exports represented in his total sales.
2.68     Other measures  relating  to  export  promotion affected taxation.
There was a revision of Regulations and procedures were revised to reduce
delays in refunding the value-added tax (VAT) to exporters. In addition,
it became possible to recover the VAT within six months for capital equip-
ment incorporated in fixed assets.   Seal  and stamp taxes on export credit
operations were eliminated.
2.69     New legislation gave greater flexibility  to PROCHILE.  In the end
of 1985, the agency prepared a study of the goods that could be exported in
the short-term, and it assigned experts to some small- and medium-size
producers to assist their exports by improving quality control, marketing,
and access to market information.
2.70     Within the 1985-86 action program,  in March 1986 a public-private
committee was created to coordinate the major investments required in the
forestry sector.
2.71     Another measure to promote export performance was the reduction of
banks' reserve requirements for  credits  to  exporters.   The 52 margin on
capital and reserves that banks were allowed to lend to exporters was
raised to  1OX.    The  margin  of  guarantees  for  credit  operations was
increased from 252 to 30Z, allowing exporters to get more financial
resources. The Government also extended the period of repatriation of
receipts from exports that must be sent to free-port warehouses abroad in
order to be marketed properly.
2.72     The export promotion  policy was  constantly  enhanced with other
devices such as realistic exchange rates and low tariff levels. An excep-
tion was the system of surcharges established to protect domestic industry
from unfair competition from abroad, which followed the definitions of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
2.73     There were several measures the  authorities had to take to ensure
the success and sustainability of the program, since one of the risks that
both the Chilean authorities and World Bank staff acknowledged was the
possible discontinuation of the program as a consequence of external
shocks. These measures were:



- 28 -
*    to maintain  an  exchange  rate  compatible with normineral
exports;
*    to develop the public-private forestry program;
*    to  expand  CODELCO's   capacity  consistently  with  other
investment prioritiest
*    to readjust cereal and sugar  support prices in accord with
the general tariff level and to define the sugar policy.
2.74     The Bank monitored the  ratification  of  the CSF in January 1986.
The public-private forestry program was approved in 1986. Bank monitoring
was also directed to follow noncopper export performance and to review the
price bands for support prices of sugar and cereals.
2.75     The CSF was to operate  on  an  experimental base during its first
year. The copper reference price was agreed in December 1985, and the fund
was put into effect the  next month.    The  CSF mechanism applied only to
CODELCO's exports, which amounted to 792 of total copper exports in 1985.
CSF funds were deposited in the Central Bank and incorporated in its inter-
national reserves.
2.76     The CSF would have a quarterly balance determined as follows:
*    a reference path for the price of copper was set by averag-
ing the price of each of the four quarters; this path was
considered in the budget and in the balance of payments;
?    the variation in the balance  of the CSF equaled the physi-
cal volume exported by CODELCO times the average difference
during that period between the market price (f.o.b.)
received by CODELCO and the reference price. The differ-
ence was adjusted  by  different weightst    zero within
tUS$0.50 per pound from the reference price, and 502 within
tUS$0.12 and tUS$0.05  per pound.   Outside the preceding
band, a factor of 1OOZ was applied;
*    The balance of the CSF in a year had to correspond with the
yearly average of prices and quantities;
*    The quarterly balance  of  the  CSF was reviewed every six
months in the context of the SAL program in order to avoid
destabilizing effects caused by the automatic operation of
the formula in a context of fluctuating noncopper prices,
import prices, and interest rates.
2.77     Public Finance.  The main issue  in the area of public finance was
the need to increase public savings. One of the effects of falling primary
export prices was the massive loss of fiscal revenues as a result of the



-29_
reduction in the value of exports.    To attain sustainability of the poli-
cies underlying the SAP, emphasis therefore had to be placed on strengthen-
ing the State's finances. This had to be accompanied by greater consisten-
cy between public sector management and investment. The increase of fiscal
savings had to be achieved with a parallel increase in private savings.
2.78     Public expenditures in 1985 had  to  be adjusted to reflect relief
and reconstruction requirements of the March earthquake and the need for
fiscal austerity. The fiscal program for the year included contingency
investments of 0.5Z of GDP to be activated if net private spending was
lower then foreseen or if emergency financing could be obtained to repair
the earthquake damage. A PIP was elaborated for 1986 and was ratified by
April 1986. Some projects in transportation infrastructure were reduced or
eliminated from the 1985-87 PIP.    Construction  of Line 3 of the Santiago
Metro was suspended indefinitely.    The  annual investment on the southern
highway was not increased in real terms. Other projects, such as new irri-
gation works, were also postponed. These cutbacks were made to give prior-
ity to investments of high return in agriculture and mining.
2.79     In the area  of public  administration  the programs of technical
assistance financed by the Bank were to produce studies for the design and
implementation of organization and information systems to improve the con-
trol and management  of public  enterprises.    In  EMPORCHI (Chilean Port
Enterprise), EMPREMAR (Chilean Maritime Enterprise), LAN (Chilean Airlines)
and the Rail Authority, for example, the technical assistance program
strengthened planning and management capabilities, study of which began in
April 1986.
2.80     In 1985 a series  of  studies  on  the  labor market was begun to
review the efficiency  of  the  Government's  EEPs.    The authorities took
actions aimed to promote the use of labor in production and to increase the
efficiency of public employment programs.
2.81     The overall nonfinancial  public  sector  deficit was reduced from
4.4: of GDP in 1984 to 2.2Z of GDP in 1986. Expanded exports and rising
copper prices meant larger revenues.   The increase of public savings (4.4Z
of GDP in 1986, up from 0.61 in 1984) was the consequence of spending
restraint.    Wages,  salaries,  and  transfer payments  for unemployment
declined in real terms.    So  the  decrease  in  the public sector deficit
reflected the net effect of current expenditure restraint and expanded
public investment. In 1986 the latter reached 7.72 of GDP, over 1 point
higher than in 1984. The increment of public savings and investment was
accompanied by increases in private savings and investment. Total invest-
ment rose from 1.6Z of GDP in 1984 to 14.62 in 1986.
2.82     Financial Rehabilitation Policy.   The government intended to con-
clude normalization of the financial sector in 1986. The measures taken
were to end Central Bank subsidies to borrowers.   It would not set up new
lines of concessional credit to refinance loans already outstanding. This
activity was left to the private financial institutions. The process of
normalization of the bank system was very expensive, and the Treasury and



- 30 -
international banks would have to  become  suppliers  of finance In case of
need. In 1985 the authorities launched a program for recapitalizing the
Banco de Chile and the Banco de Santiago. Before the start of the SAP, the
Central Bank was engaged in rescuing banks and firms seriously affected by
the crisis. This action implied subsidies and debt rescheduling. The
transfers of funds to the private sector associated with the rehabilitation
and recapitalization Was estimated to be about US$6 billion in 1983 and
1984. Part of these transfers were recovered from the private banks and
firms through compulsory repurchases of their portfolios from the Central
Bank.
2.83     In 1985 the financial system  began  to make profits.  In June of
that year the government announced the gradual phasing out, by the end of
1986. of the preferential exchange rate program for debtors owing more than
US$50,000, of dollar swaps, and of dollar deposit subsidies by the begin-
ning of 1987.
2.84     Finally the  authorities  complemented  the  policies to diversify
exports, promote growth, and rehabilitate firms and banks near collapse
with a restrained wage policy.  Wage indexation was ended.  In 1985 employ-
ment increased by 6.6?, the rate of open unemployment was 8.8Z, and the
rate of unemployment prevented by the EEPs was 5.1Z.
Implementation of SAL II
2.85     It was recognized from the  beginning  that most of the structural
problems could not be resolved in one year, and then it was realized that a
longer period for adjustment--say, three to five years--was necessary. In
February 1986 a Bank mission visited Chile to review progress on SAL I and
was asked to consider a second SAL. Disbursement of SAL 1I would be front-
loaded, with the first tranche (US$150 million) released upon effectiveness
November 1986 and the second one (US$100 million) after a performance
review to be held six months later (as it happened, in June 1987). The
project was first presented to the Bank's Board in February 1986. Negotia-
tions were completed by mid-August 1986, and the date for effectiveness was
December 1986.    SAL  II's  conditionalities  were *as  described earlier.
Despite SAL I, the adjustment process was not yet solid. Chile could pay
only 50? of the interest on its foreign debt by itself. Insufficiency of
savings and investment persisted, which made it doubtful that steady growth
of 52 per year would be maintained. The conditions emphasized the need for
consolidating the results of SAL I through the continuation of the policies
agreed in the first loan, with more concern for the social sectors. The
government complied with almost all requirements for the release of the
US$100 million of the second  tranche.   The good economic performance per-
mitted not only the disbursement of the loan but also the consideration of
a third SAL.
2.86     The goals of  economic  policy  stated  by  the government were as
follows. Once adjustment in the external accounts was achieved, a reacti-
vation of the economy was expected--but under a reduction in foreign bor-
rowing and hand in hand with efforts to bring down inflation. The govern-
ment expected a 31 GDP growth rate and an inflation rate of 202 a year.



- 31 -
Progress in the normalization, recapitalization and reprivatization of
firms and banks rescued by the Central Bank had a positive effect on the
reactivation. The improvement in savings and Investments attracted foreign
capital and this made feasible the resumption and completion of important
projects.   Almost all the  objectives  had been achieved within the frame-
work of SAL I, but inflation was higher than programmed and in 1987 prices
grew 21.52 instead of  the  expected  152.   The Government raised interest
rates between March and October 1987, and the rate of inflation slowed down
in the following months.
2.87     Export Promotion.  The fulfillment  of the BANK's export promotion
conditionalities was centered on the adjustment of exchange rates for non-
mineral exports. Under SAL II no large devaluations took place; the ex-
change rate moved with mini-devaluations.   The purpose was to maintain the
exchange rate stable in real terms, but in fact there was a depreciation of
the peso. In January 1987 the execution of a plan for forestry develop-
ment, including an investment program for 1988-90, was started. The study
on PROCHILE's efficiency continued under a Bank's TAL. The CSF was renewed
for another year in January  1987.    Export incentives were sufficient to
exceed the 62 targeted increase in real noncopper exports, which grew at
more than double that rate.
2.88     Public Finances.  Measures to achieve public savings equivalent to
4.7Z of projected GDP were put into effect in March 1987. The satisfactory
execution of the 1986 PIP was verified, and during the second half of 1986
a PIP for 1987-89 was prepared. There was also substantial progress in the
studies on the efficiency of public firm management. The fiscal program
assumed that current expenditures would decline slightly in real terms.
The increase in public investment from 7.12 of GDP in 1985 to 7.62 of GDP
in 1986 was concentrated in infrastructure: works already begun because of
the March 1985 earthquake; subsidized housing; construction of public
morks; and the  investment  projects  of  CODELCO,  ENDESA (Santiago Energy
Company),  CHILECTRA  (Chilean   Electric   Company),  CAP  (Pacific  Steel
Company), and other productive  public  enterprises.   The 1986 budget pro-
jected a deficit amounting to 2.22 of GDP, which would be financed mainly
by external credit. Public savings were 31 of GDP.
2.89     Financial Rehabilitation Policy.    The  process of recapitalizing
banks was continuing, and a substantial advance was verified at the end of
1986.   The  preferential  exchange  rate  program  for  debtors  with over
US$50,000 in obligations was phased out by the end of this year. In April
1987 the subsidy implicit in dollar deposit and swap schemes for the re-
structured foreign debts of the financial system were eliminated. The
government had capitalized the five major intervened banks, required share-
holders of other weakened institutions to subscribe to new capital,
achieved the sale of bad portfolios to the Central Bank, and completed
provisions for loan losses.    The  costs  incurred  by the Central Bank in
recapitalization were determined as were the absorption conditions accord-
ing to the 1987-90 monetary and financial program. The normalization of
intervened banks and firms was completed in 1987; it constituted a major
element of SAL II.   The  intervened banks were satisfactorily capitalized,



- 32 -
with leverage ratios from 9? to 14? (after adjustments for double counting
on balance sheets). The rescued institutions were prepared to make opera-
tional profits and then repurchase their nonperforming portfolios from the
Central Bazk. The World Bank saw the state divestments as having high
costs, since the shares of the enterprises were sold at very low prices.
It therefore seemed convenient to slow down the process of reprivatization.
In any case, the recapitalization supported by SAL IT was completed.
2.90     The new banking law 18,576 of November 1986 was designed to reduce
risk and speculation. Bank managers were made legally responsible for the
operation of their new portfolios.   A  supervision mechanism was set up by
the SBIF to ensure against any direct and indirect related-party loans. In
September 1986 law 18,519 put into effect a new system for bank deposit
insurance that conditioned such protection on specific increases in equity.
The governmeat established tests for risk classification of paper issues
and the recording of five-year earnings. Privatized state enterprises were
excepted.
2.91     A problem in connection with  channeling  private savings was the
restrictions on investment Imposed on AlPs. Pension funds represented over
20? of domestic savings. To avoid risks, AFPs could invest their pension
funds only in the most  highly  qualified  instruments.   Only 5? could be
invested in equities on the stock  market.   (By 1991 this percentage would
be increased to 30S). The companies where these funds could be invested
could have no single shareholder controlling any more than 20? of the
stocks. In addition, APPs could place no more than 20? of their funds in
any single investment. The excessive care to avoid risks represented not
only a limitation on broadening the investment channels for pension funds,
but also a constant threat of expanded consumption from public expenditures
financed by bond issues bought by the APPs.
2.92     Social Sectors.  The government  decided to improve the efficiency
of public and private health care systems, but there were no additional
resources to invest in this sector.    The policy was to maintain the level
of public expenditures but to modify the composition of speading in favor
of capital and against current  expenditures.   Priority was given to main-
tain existing facilities and then to replacing outmoded equipment. A com-
pulsory payroll deduction for health care was increased from 6S to 7Z.
2.93     In aidition, minor  adjustments  were made  in educational sector
reform with respect to student loan administration and school municipaliza-
tion.
2.94     The social security system was  modified to improve its efficiency
and coverage. Voluntary savings accounts, to be financed through payroll
deductions and managed by the AFPs, were introduced. The Bank mission had
reservations on the scheme because it could lead to open loans to pension
plan members and could raise the APPs' operational costs. The mission
agrsed that, so long as the voluntary accounts did not receive tax prefer-
ences relative to the banking system, they might be an acceptable instru-
ment for inducing smallholder savings.    In another area, the labor market
studies about the relative efficiencies of the EEPs continued as scheduled.

Implementation of SAL III
2.95     The Bank's financial assistance to support Chile's ongoing SAP was
extended by approval of a third SAL. SAL II successfully met its macroeco-
nomic targets, but there were some areas that still required consolidation,
such as mobilization of domestic savings and investment and more emphasis
on the social sectors.   SAL  III was  another  US$250 million loan, to be
disbursed in two equal tranches.    The  program was first presented to the
Bank's Board in May 1987.   The  negotiations  were completed at the end of
October 1987, and the date for effectiveness was December 1987. The loan,
similar to SALs I and II, was intended to finance imports, thus continuing
relief for Chile's balance of payments.  Conditionalities for SAL III were
described above. The application of SAL III was accompanied by monitoring
of economic performance by both the Bank and the InF. The economy went on
expanding at about 6.72 in 1988; unemployment declined to 8.8Z from 9.6 in
the previous year, and real wages increased by 5.32. The inflation rate
slackened to 12.3Z, down from 21.51  in  1987.   There have been periods in
which the money supply  expanded  significantly.   The authorities and Bank
officials were concerned about the impact on the improved situation already
achieved through the  SAP.    The  Government  imposed restrictive monetary
policies whenever credit expansion could jeopardize the adjustment process.
These attempts were successful, and monetary policy remained tight.
2.96     Exnort Promotion.   Export  promotion  policies  were kept in line
with those of the previous SALs.   The main  features in SAL III were the
strengthening of the CSF in 1988 by narrowing the price bands that activate
the fund (from US$0.05 - US$0.125 per pound to US$0.04 - US$0.10 per pound,
around the reference price of US$0.75 per pound) and by substituting quar-
terly for annual averaging.   There  had  been increases in the reserves of
the CSF during 1988.   The  Chilean  authorities expected that CS? reserves
could reach US$400 million by September 1988 and Bank officials thought
those reserves could exceed US$500 million by the end of 1988, provided
that international copper prices did not decline sharply. Such levels of
reserves were higher than those expected when the SAL III agreement was
signed. Copper prices were supposed to be US$0.75 per pound when the cur-
rent estimate in 1988 was US$1  per  pound.   On these grounds, the Chilean
Government requested Bank authorization to use US$200 million from the CSF
for debt repurchases. This request was accepted. An agreement on restruc-
turing debt was scheduled to take place between Chile and commercial banks
whereby Chile could use international reserves for debt buybacks. This use
of CSF funds was also consistent with the objectives of SAL III: the re-
duction of Chile's debt bought at a discount would increase public savings.
At the same time, Chile had improved its creditworthiness and its position
to re-enter international financial markets.
2.97     The maintenance of  the  exchange  rate  policy was implemented by
daily devaluations of the peso, made by taking into account the difference
between domestic and external Inflation. This systematic currency depreci-
ation was corrected in 1988.

2.98     The policy of export promotion was maintained.  To offset the 202
uniform nominal tariff and to stimulate export production, the administra-
tion permitted (through a revision of decrees 224 and 409) the automatic
duty-free importation of inputs destined for such production. Another
measure was to replace the existing rebate system by expanding the duty
suspension provisions of the drawback regime. Noncopper exports were 34.11
higher in 1988 than in the year before. The rise in copper prices contrib-
uted to an overall export increase of 31.82 in 1987. Imports grew at 20.41
(capital goods imports increased 25.21 in the first semester of 1988, com-
pared with the same period in  1987).    In 1988 the trade balance improved
further. The surplus reached US$2.075 million, 69Z higher than in 1987.
Exports rose by 31.81, with mineral exports accounting for only 28.8S of
the increase.   Industrial exports  advanced  39.42 in the first six months
of 1988, compared with the same period in 1987.
2.99     The implementation of statutory measures  was designed to improve
the drawback system for small-scale exporters, to include indirect ex-
porters under the system of customs tariff refunding on imported inputs and
capital goods, and to establish the legal framework for an export credit
insurance scheme. Additional legislation was to set up a partial guarantee
fund for small- and medium-scale exporters.
2.100    In the first six months  of  1988, the balance of payments surplus
was US$224 million. The surplus covered the loss in international reserves
that occurred in 1987. In the first seven months of 1988, the trade sur-
plus and debt conversion contributed to a net reduction of external debt by
US$984 million.
2.101    Public Finances.  Fiscal policy  continued to stress larger fiscal
savings and a high rate of public investment. Continuous improvements in
its finances led the Government to lower the VAT from 201 to 161. The aim
of reducing the State's role in the economy has prevailed, and the adminis-
tration has continued with its program of reprivatization. The rate of
public saving was expected to grow from 4.81 of GDP in 1987 to 52 of GDP in
1988. This target was pursued through a policy of current expenditure
restraint and of repricing public enterprises' services. The targets were
surpassed, since public savings amounted to 5.41 of GDP in 1987 and were
7.71 of GDP a year  later.    Public  investment was expected to remain at
about 7.51 of GDP. The contingency investments included in previous fiscal
budgets were activated in the amount of 0.11 of GDP when emergency loans
were obtained from the Bank and the  IDB.   The choice of projects was made
after rigorous evaluations.   The  program of public expenditures respected
the target that limited the overall deficit of the nonfinancial public
sector to less than 1.62  of  GDP  in  1988.    As it happened, the deficit
shrank to 0.41 of GDP in 1987 and became a surplus of 2.41 of GDP in 1988.
2.102    The policies  designed  to  increase  private  sector  savings and
investment remained as before, creating a macroeconomic framework consis-
tent with stable rules of the game and relative prices and with prudent
management of aggregate demand.  The  tax  system was supposed to cause the
smallest possible disincentives for private saving and investment, the
medium- and long-term aspects of which were stressed.



_ 35 -
2.103    Financial Rehabilitation.    The measures  to  be  applied to the
financial system were designed to devote special attention to the institu-
tional aspects of the capital market.    Specifically, it was intended that
provisions contained in the recent banking law reforms, particularly, in
connection with the SBXD and the regulations affecting the services pro-
vided by financial intermediaries, would be fully applied in order to
induce competition in the capital markets. The continuity of the financial
system's rehabilitation was ensured by the maintenance of loan collections
and the repurchase of substandard portfolios from the Central Bank.
2.104    Certain tax initiatives were designed to accelerate development of
the capital markets. For instance, the stamp duty on loans from 2.42 to
1.22 was reduced. Initiatives were taken to revise the income tax law in
order to achieve a more symmetrical treatment of capital gains and losses.
Margins for tax exceptions on income derived from capital gains were wid-
ened. Tax exemptions were introduced to include incomes derived from secu-
rities issued by open corporations. Other initiatives implied revisions in
the tax treatment of investments in mutual funds.
2.105    Measures designed to  improve  the  regulations governing institu-
tional investors were considered.   These studies included plans to promote
private systems for rating the risks associated with publicly offered secu-
rities and shares.   These  mechanisms  would  operate in parallel with the
existing AFP regulations concerning investments by insurance companies and
mutual funds. In the case of insurance, rules about reserve accounting
were to be revised. The application of new rules relating to AFPs' invest-
ments in shares, from recent changes in decree law 3,500, will also be
analyzed.
2.106    The measures taken in accord with  the SAP had a positive impact.
The financial system first made an overall profit in 1985. Its rentability
has continued to improve since then.   In the first five months of 1988 the
annualized rate of return on equity reached 32.8Z compared with yields of
19.4X and 13.52 In 1987 and 1986, respectively.
2.107    Social Policies.   Through  its  conditionalities,  SAL III placed
more explicit emphasis on the social aspects of adjustment. In 1987 social
outlays remained practically unchanged, with only marginal increases in
health, housing and regional development. For the SAP, health expenditures
and the publicly funded portion of the pension system were important: they
represented 302 of noninterest current Government expenditures in 1987.
The social security system was  modified.   The administration intended to
increase real nonpersonnel outlays for health, by 152 in 1988, to extend
preventive care and to invest in the rehabilitation of equipment over two
years.
2.108    For maternal and child health,  135 primary health care facilities
were transferred to municipalities in order to improve the quantity and
quality of services. For chronic diseases and adult health, the Government
made efforts to standardize norms for diagnosis and treatment by organizing
workshops and studies, some for training purposes. Infant mortality de-
clined from 65.82 of live births in 1973 to'19.4Z in 1986. Improvements in



- 36 -
preventive medicine and incroased provision of safe water and sewerage
services helped to raise the life expectancy at birth form 85.6 years in
1975-80 to 71 years in 1986.
2.109    Chile's housing program provided 120,000 homes to low-income fami-
lies during  1984-86.   According  to plans  submitted  for Bank support,
500,000 houses will be made available to people below the urban poverty
threshold in the next three years.
2.110    Government SEPs engaged 500,000 persons by 1983.  In the following
years economic recovery and low wages increased employment significantly.
In the period from October 1987 to January 1988, the official unemployment
rate averaged 7.72 of the labor force.   It was 9.6Z in the last quarter of
1986. The EEPs reduced their client rolls by over 100,000 persons in 1987,
leaving fever than 90,000 in  those  programs.    It vas a significant fall
from the 1983 peak.

2.111    On the basis of the SAP  and  the assumptions of a moderate annual
growth in the OECD economies, recovery in most of Chile's Latin American
trading partners, a 101 increase in copper prices by 1990, and a decline of
31 in real international interest rates, the balance of payments projection
shown in Table 2.7 was prepared.

2.112    The current account deficit vould be  reduced from 10.62 of GDP in
1984 to 2.52 of GDP in 1990, and the resource balance would change from a
negative US$204 million in 1984 to US$1.1 billion in 1990. The 1985-86
recovery would be supported qy the three-year DFl EFP, the Bank's SAL I of
US$250 million (plus a syndicated B-loan guarantee of US$150 million), a
comnercial bank package of US$1.1 billion, and reduced interest payments.
But an annual US$1.1 billion of additional new financing would be needed
during 1987-90. In volume terms, copper exports would grow 20S and non-
copper exports 6Z in 1985-90, and imports would increase 202 faster than
GDP. Among noncopper exports, agricultural products (fruits and wood)
would gain share.   Import  substitutions  were foreseen in food, textiles,
shoes, wheat, oilseeds, and energy.   GDP would  expand at 42 a year.  The
leading sectors would be agriculture (including fishing and forestry), with
a 4.6S annual growth in 1984-90; mining, with 32 a year; industry, at 42
annually (including a low in 1985). Progress would be faster in the 1990s.
2.113    To attain those  objectives.  the  investment ratio would increase
from 14Z in 1985 to 202 In 1990. Although terms of trade improvements were
expected to bring income relief of 22 of 1990 GDP, a dramatic increase in
national savings from 7Z to 182 of GDP and an even faster rise in domestic
savings would be required (public savings were to go from 4.52 of GDP in
1986 to 6.52 in 1990; household savings were to provide a similar amount by
1990). Interest payments abroad would drop from 102 to 62 of GDP by 1990,
and foreign savings would be only 2.5Z of GDP that year.
2.114.  Unemployment would be slowly  reduced  despite cuts in social pro-
grams and EEPs, and assets' property would be more widely distributed.
SAL It
2.115    Many of the assumptions  underlying  the  expected impact of SAL I
were kept to assess that of SAL II, but in the second SAL more emphasis was
placed on the need for moderate increases in consumption and unemployment
to make the SAP sustainable and on a reduction of the debt burden to make
it viable (Table 2.8).

2.116    Non-copper exports would grow 6 S yearly, thus reducing the copper
share in goods and nonfactor services (GUPS) exports to 40? and the
interest on the debtlexports ratio to 27S (from 422) by 1990. A moderate
increase in the terms of trade was expected as well as a strong savings
effort (a 342 marginal rate) in order to achieve 4.4? yearly growth and a
reduction of the unemployment rate to one digit. The investment rate would
have to go up to 19S in 1990.   National savings should reach 15  of GDP in
1990, but now domestic savings could grow less, due to declining interest
payments abroad. Public savings should reach 5.5? of GDP in 1990 (from
3.8S in 1985) and private savings 52 of GDP by the same year.
2.117    To finance the projected growth,  net borrowings of US$1.1 billion
would be needed in 1987 and in 1988, as well as commercial loan resched-
ulings, a 32 yearly increase in commercial banks' exposure, and new money
from official sources (Table 2.9).

SAL III
2.118    Although the appraisal of SAL III's impact retained the assumption
of moderate growth in the OECD countries, it foresaw an increase of nominal
international interest rates of 1.2? by 1989 (and stabilization thereafter)
and copper price increases of 3.3? yearly (after an upward bubble). On
these grounds, GDP was to grow at 4.9Z yearly through 1992, consumption at
32. The faster increase in national savings would fund debt service and
investment. Growth would be fueled by exports. Noncopper exports would
rise 62 annually until 1992, but copper exports would keep their share (due
to expanded capacity). This export expansion would lower the interest on
the debtlexports ratio to 18? by  1992.    It would also support imports at
the level of 29? of GDP until 1990 (with increases later, due to exhaustion
of domestic oil supplies).   But  slightly  improved terms of trade and the
lower debt burden would allow a fall of the current account deficit to 2.8?
of GDP by 1992 (from 6.5? in 1986; Table 2.10).

2.119    Investment would need to increase 9X yearly to reach 19Z of GDP by
1992, and it would be extended to infrastructure for export and import
substitution.  Financing would come  from  increased savings.  The national
savings rate should double by 1992 (from 8S in 1986), whereas domestic
savings should grow less, due to the decline in interests on foreign debt.
Public savings (after interest) should go up to 5.52 of GDP by 1990, where-
as private savings should surpass 10 of GDP by 1992. Meanwhile, foreign
savings would be required to fund the combined current account deficit of
US$1.9 billion in 1987-88; US$230 million from foreign investment; US$460
million from interest rescheduling; US$900 million from multilateral loans.
2.120    For 1989-92 the  annual  current  account  deficit would be US$750
million. Direct investment would fill US$120 million, but commercial banks
would reschedule only repayments  of  principal.   Suppliers' credits could
bring US$300 million (to fund large projects) and international institu-
tions US$140 million annually--which would leave a yearly gap of near
US$200 million to be covered by other sources (Table 2.11).

2.121    The SAP would pay  large  social  dividends  in increased wages,
employment, and soclal expenditures by the Government. A reduction of 8X
ln infant and 20S in national mortality was expected over five years; a
drop in school-age malnutrition of 121 to 8S was foreseen by 1990.
A#praisal of the Impact
2.122    The aims of the Chilean SAP  since 1985 were to produce the accel-
eration of exports and expand domestic savings in order to permit a recov-
ery of economic growth and employment while the country continued to
service its external debt. By improving the performance of the balance of
payments Chile would strengthen its creditworthiness and attract a continu-
ous flow of foreign capital. The expansLon of exports was supposed to take
place by applying sound incentives to noncopper exports, thus diversifying
exports in order to reduce the strong dependence Chile traditionally had on
copper and nitrates.   Another  important  objective was to increase public
savings and achieve more efficiency in investment programs. A third goal
was to improve the condition of banking and corporate finances by means of
recapitalization and reprivatization schemes.   A  fourth objective was to
improve the  pension  program,  health  care  system,  and  education.  The
approach in the social area has been to direct public spending to satisfy
needs of the sectors in which poverty is extreme.
2.123    To analyze the impact of institutional changes and other modifica-
tions produced by implementation of the SAP is very difflcult. Benefits
spread throughout the economy, accruing to diverse economic agents. More-
over, to evaluate certain effects in isolation, sophistLcated models should
be constructed to evaluate the empirical evidence (see, for example, the
Technical Appendix). Instead, a vlew of economic performance--in particu-
lar, of the specific areas in which the SAP applied--may provide a useful
assessment of fulfillment of objectives.
2.124    In short, the SAP produced positive  results.  In the years of its
application, starting from an extremely difficult situation, there was a
significant recovery in economic growth and in employment caused by an
important expansion of exports and an increase in domestlc savings. This
performance was compatible with the country's servicing its external debt
in a consistent way.
2.125    The macroeconomic  approach  used  implied  a  conservative fiscal
policy designed to improve public finances and consolidate the balance of
payments, even with the negative external shock of deterioration in the
terms of trade that  started  in  1985.    The debt management strategy was
complemented by one of the first (and most) innovative programs in the
regions to induce conversion of discounted foreign debt into equity and
domestic liabilities. Between mid-1985 and mid-1988 the amount of con-
verted debt was about US$4.6 billion.    The government has also managed to
recapitalize and reprivatize the corporate and financial sectors through
strong monitoring and pressure to make institutions repurchase their debts
in order to complete the program as soon as possible and to maintain withxin
limits the strong lossei from changes in ownership. The rate of inflation
was maintained roughly constant at annual leveis close to 202. The follow-
ing subsections give a more detailed account of economic performance.

Economic Growth
2.126    The macroeconmic Impact of the  SAP wae  very favorable.  At the
beginning, economic policy was designed mainly to deal with stability and
balance of payments disequilibrium in a short-term contest. Most of the
actions directed to that end suffered from frequent setbacks and from the
different views of changing economic authorities. The burden of the finan-
cial crisis aggravated the situation. In 1983 the Government was overopti-
mistic about economic recovery while servicing the external debt, and its
concern about recession produced the relaxation of adjustment measures in
1984 (Table 2.12).

2.127    In 1982-84 there were  wide  deviations  between the Government's
ex.*ected values for target variables and the actual figures. The 1982 fall
in GDP was underestimated; the prospects a year later ware 4Z growth, but
GDP continued to decline (although at a reduced rate of 0.72). In 1984
actual growth exceeded  the  programed  rate.    Results for the remaining

variables results were mixed.   In  1985 the situation changed with respect
to the design and implementation of economlc policy. The stabilization
effort was supplemented by a SAP with financial backing. Soon e"ogenous
factors moved favorably for Chile's economy.   An upward trend in the terms
of trade began in  1986,  mainly  influenced by export prices, particularly
for. copper, which in 1988 practically doubled its 1985-86 levels. Import
prices also went up, but  at  a  slower  pace.   The trade volume increased
significantly.  With the exception of  1986, import volume grew faster than
export volume. The measures adopted to free markets had positive effects
in expanding trade and in stabilizing Chile's balance of payments, which
also benefited from a decline in the international interest rates.
2.128    The administration elaborated its program  in 1985 by relying on a
set of assumptions about the future evolution of foreign trade prices and
quantities. They underestimated export prices and overestimated import
prices (Table 2.13).    The  authorities  also  overestimated the levels of
international  rates  of   interest   (Table   2.14).    These  assumptions
contributed to the design of policies stressing graduality and prudence.
In this conservative context, the results looked favorable.

rate was more erratic, but efforts were rewarded when it slowed to 12.31 in
1988, a remarkable success. The performance of these two key variables was
better than expected (Table 2.15).

2.130    The current account of the balance of payment reflected the behav-
ior of exports and imports in  value  terms.   The large expansion in trade
produced an important reduction of  the  deficitt   US$317 million in 1988,
772 lower than in 1985.   This  reduction vas taking place throughout the
course of the period, and the current account deficft was increasingly
within the target.  Similarly, the  overall  surplus In the balance of pay-
meats showed the impact of favorable external economic and financial condi-
tions and of success in reducing the foreign debt, particularly in 1987 and
1988 (Table 2.16).

2.131    The public saving ratio was  another  target variable that showed
the viability of the Government's economic policies carried out after 1985.
The current expenditure restraint, the more efficient allocation of invest-
ible resources, and the rehabilitation and reprivatization of state enter-
prises allowed considerable change in the fiscal situation. By 1988 the
public sector balance became positive and slightly exceeded the program
goals of 2.5S  of  GDP.    During  1985-88  there  were minor readjustments
required by activation of part of the contingency investment plans.
2.132    Thus, economic performance was  excellent.    But  how much of the
success can be attributed to the macroeconomic framework of stabilization
and trade liberalization, institutional changes promoting export diversifi-
cation, measures to rehabilitate corporate and financial institutions, and
other factors? It is difficult to separate the effects without recourse to
general equilibrium models, but a clear picture emerges from the figures.
In 1985-86 the stabilization policies and a consistent and sound SAP,
backed by an important financial package from abroad, played the leading



-45-
role,  The Goverament's  actions were  sensible  and  adequate, as was the
Bank's monitoring, particularly In fielding lntially adverse terms of
trade, n impoaing severe fiscal restraint, and Jn constraining the cost of
the financial crisis. While policies were kept on focus, from 1986 on much
of the economic expansion was due to positive, unforeseen external shocks,
through prices and interest rates (Table 2.17).

2.133    The external shock effect  was  actually  nil  in 1985t  the gains
from international interest rate reductions were offset by losses from the
terms of trade. In 1986 there was a net benefit produced by improvements
in the terms of trade and interest cuts, amounting to more than US$170
million. In 1987 both factors contributed to generate a gain of over
US$700 million. A year later, the gains increased by nearly 30?, to more
than US$900 million.   The most  important  factor was improvement in the
rerms of trade. By 1988 the cumulative effects of better terms of trade
and lower world interest rates had added up to 10.41 of GDP in four years.
More than 602 of the gains were attributable to the improved terms of
trade. Part of those gains were expected by the Government when it de-
signed the SAP. Actual  figures  surpassed  planned magnitudes.  The lower
part of Table 2.17 shows that the direct impact of positive external shocks
accounted for 40.7?  of  GDP  growth  in  1985-88s    better terms of trade
explain 28.11; and lower interest rates 40.72. It also points out that the
unexpected part of those shocks  (they were partly expected) explains 97.62
of the excess of effective over programmed GDP growth (terms of trade,
77.52; interest rates, 21.32).
Z.134    After the critical years  1982  and  1983, when GDP declined 14.2?
and 0.7? with respect to  previous  years,  the new trade and exchange rate
policies and financial measures put forward by the Government restored a
positive rate of growth in an atmosphere of increased competitiveness.  The
experience of the economic crisis  induced  the authorities to state that a
longer-term program was a  necessary precondition for attaining sustainable
economic growth. Early in 1984, a  three-year PIP was produced, and a year
later the SAP was started.
2.135    A short-lived GDP expansion in  1984 proved unsustainable.  A more
thorough and decisive attempt at stabilization with adjustment was launched
in early 1985. The expansion of economic activity slowed its pace to an
annual 2.4?, as a consequence of reductions in consumption and gross
domestic investment (Table  2.18).    The  following  years showed rates of
growth over 5X, higher but close  to  those expected by the three SALs (4S;
4.4?, and 4.9Z).

2.136    Recovery from the 1982-83 crisis was taking place with a signifi-
cant role played by mining, although this sector would gradually lose its
pre-eminence. An important comeback was also happening in agriculture.
manufacturing, and construction.   If  one  compares the perfor-nance of the
Chilean economy with aggregate perforrance of developing countries in simi-
lar periods, it imediately becomes apparent that the economic growth
attained in Chile can be attributed to the country's efforts to implement
structural adjustments within a  consistent framework of macroeconomic pol-
icy. During 1980-87 the economic growth of developing countries averaged
2.32 a year, far lower than the 5.62 the group achieved during 1970-79. In
Chile, GDP expanded at the rate of 22 annually in the 19709 and at 2.62 a
year in the 1980s.   But  the  evolution  of  Chilean GDP since 1975 can be
separated into an initial expansion. (1975-81), at 4.12 annual growth; a
crisis period (1982-85), with -1.92 yearly decline; and a second recovery,
at 5.12 increase per year--all while Chile was carrying a heavy foreign
debt burden.
2.137    Sr. figures in Table  2.18  show  that  the SAP, launched in 1985,
produced drsmatic effects on both the demand and supply sides. On the
demand side, exports in real terms acceierated to a 72 annual growth, from
4.72 in 1982-85. Consumption reverted from -3.52 annual change during the
crisis to a quite moderate 2.22 rise after 1985. The turnaround was most
pronounced in domestic investment, which since 1985 moved from a -17.42
yearly fall to a sustained 102 growth rate. On the supply side, GDP, which
declined 1.52 yearly in 1982-85, recovered to a growth rate of over 52,
with moderate acceleration. The drastic drop in imports (in real terms)
durlhg the crisis years was followed by 72 yearly increases, roughly in
line with exports. Both expanded faster than GDP, reflecting the opening
of the economy. The dramatic turnaround of domestic investment was over-
shadowed by an even more spectacular change in the behavior of both na-
tional and domestic savings, which since 1985 grew 17.42 and 35.52 yearly,
respectively.
The Forei_n Sector
2.138    In the first  half  of  1985,  the  Government reduced its uniform
import tariff from 352 to 202, as a consequence of bad price prospects for
primary exports and the increasing need to expand noncopper exports. In
addition, the exchange rate was devalued 251, bringing the peso to its
lowest value with respect to the dollar in ten years. The devaluation was
destined to provide incentives to exporters and was maintained with fre-
quent periodic adjustments  to  the  exchange  rate.    In fact, additional
devaluations were observed in 1985-87 (Table 2.19). The reduction in the
import tariff was done in steps:    first  it was lowered from 352 to 302;
four months later it attained the level of 202. In 1988 the uniform import
tariff was further reduced to  152.    The authorities considered that free
trade and a low uniform import tariff would be sufficient incentives to
expand noncopper exports. They also imposed antidumping surcharges on milk
and sugar imports, to avoid unfair trade practices.

2.139    In this way a positive  environment  for new export activities was
created (Table 2.20). Koncopper exports grew in real terms at 12.6t year-
ly, more than double the target of 6Z estImated wben contracting the SALs.
The dollar value of these exports doubled between 1985 and 1988, an impor-
tant factor In the sustainability of the economic recovery. Export perfor-
mance was also helped by the significant comeback In the price of copper,
which rebounded from a low of US$0.623  a pound in 1986 to US$1.082 a pound
In 1988.

2.140    Export incentives were also  strengthened  by  the creation of the
CSF, designed to avoid future overvaluations of the currency because of
international copper prices.    The  CSF  ensured  that revenues of CODELCO
derived from higher prices would be sterilized in a reserve fund. Estab-
lished in 1985, by September 1988 these reserves had reached US$300 million
after withdrawal of US$200 million for foreign debt buybacks (Table 2.20).
2.141    The increase of  noncopper  exports  was  accompanied by efficient
import substitution. Private investment was channeled into activities that
replaced imports without creating antiexport  bias.   The share of consumer
and intermediate goods in imports declined. In contrast, import of capital
goods continued at a faster pace. This p1lies that future growth will not
be hampered by capacity obstacles.
2.142    To strengthen confidence in the private sector and attract foreign
capital, legislative changes were made to promote exports from small and
medium-size producers and to facilitate joint ventures in the energy sector
involving private firms and the SNAP.   Specific measures were taken by the
authorities to offset some effects of the uniform tariff through improved
drawback facilities. They revised decree law 1226 to allow for a 15? fis-
cal credit for domestic purchases of capital goods on equal conditions with
foreign suppliers, since these goods can be imported duty free when used in
export production.   Indirect  exporters  have  access  to the benefits for
capital goods purchases  under  decree  law  1226.   Exporters were granted
rebates for an amount equal to tariffs paid on imported inputs used for
export production, regardless of who actually imported the product. As far
as these measures designed to construct a consistent system of incentives
without interfering with the price signals go on, and provided no external
shocks occur in the following years, non traditional exports should be able
to grow faster than 10X a year in real terms. In due time this will con-
solidate the diversification of exports (Table 2.21).

2.143    The current account deficit fell by two-thirds between 1984 and 1987,
from US$2 billion to US$1.1  billion.    In 1986 Chile's reserves increased by
US$227 million. The current account deficit was 10.7? of GDP in 1984, was
reduced to 6.52 in 1986, and vent still lower to 52 in 1987. This strong
trade performance showed that  the  Government  succeeded in Implementing this
aspect of the SAP. The objectives of accelerating exports through diversifi-
cation were fulfilled, but great emphasis should be put in the future regard-
ing the sustainability of the export growth policy.
2.144    The successive negotiations of  the  external  debt helped to release
pressures on the balance  of  payments.    This  impact was complemented by an
increase in primary export values as a consequence of rising copper prices
and, particularly,  the  decline  in  international  interest  rates.   During
1983-85 the administration was forced to guarantee previously unguaranteed
external  obligations  of  private  banks   in  order  to  get  a  significant
rescheduling of payments due and US$3.2 billion in new medium-term loans.
Thus the share of public debt in total foreign debt was 39Z in 1982, 712 in
1985, and 762 in 1987.
2.145    By guaranteeing external private debt, the government linked its fate
to that of private borrowers.    The  state  guarantee on most of the external
debt eliminated the possibility of write-downs in individual cases and set a
new constraint on public finance, affecting the prospects of economic growth
because of reduced public investments.    Investment suffered as a consequence
of the shrinkage in national savings and of limited access to external sav-
ings. Therefore, the economic authorities attempted to defer the burden of
some private external interest payments by converting certain foreign bank
loans into equity (Table 2.22).

2.146    Chile's debt negotiations was  allowed  the conversion of external
into domestic obligations--by residents and nonresidents--and the purchase
of external debt by foreign investors for conversion into direct investment
in Chile.   This  mechanism  permitted  taking  advantage of the difference
between the market value of the external obligations in secondary markets
and their face value. Chile's debt was priced at 652-702 of face value in
those markets. By 1986 major foreign investors were using this conversion
scheme, and the arrangement was very useful in moderating the increase of
external debt.
2.147    Management of external debt  proved  difficult, but the efforts of
the authorities to increase creditworthiness allowed them to introduce
mechanisms that could moderate the growth of debt over through time. Their
prudence shaped performance in the capital account of the balance of
payments. The annual growth rate of external debt was 4.62 in 1982-85 and*
-0.8S in 1985-88. The external debtlGDP ratio had been going up steadily
since 1980. In 1985 it reached a maximum of 1192 and later reversed its
trend. The ratio was 832 in 1988. Analogous performance was achieved by
interest on the debtlexport  ratio:    its  peak was  482  in 1984, and it
declined to 23Z in 1988.
2.148    SAL I, the IMP's  ElF,  and  the  partial World Bank guarantee of
US$300 million in B-loan cofinancing eased conditions for a favorable
agreement with commercial banks on the 1985-86 package. The Bank guaran-
teed US$150 million of the restructuring of US$5.7 billion in maturities
due in 1985-87; the banks then provided fresh money in the amount of US$1.1
billion for 1985-86.   Some  creditor  countries rescheduled another US$145
million, representing 652 of principal payments due from July 1, 1985 to
December 31, 1986.
2.149    The authorities  agreed with  the  banks" advisory  committee in
February 1987 on the financial program for 1987-88, effective in June 1987.
For 1988, maturities amounting to US$12.4 billion were rescheduled, leaving
a financial gap of  US$650 million  for  1987-88.   Interest payments were
consolidated by this agreement into one annual payment, which deferred the
July 1988 commitment of US$450 million to January 1989. Current spreads on
past fresh money loans were reduced to 1-1182 over the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR); on those credits based on restructured maturities
(1988-91), spreads were trimmed to 12.   In April 1987 creditor governments
rescheduled 852 of maturities falling due between July 1987 and December
1988.
2.150    In April 1988 the  Government  agreed with its commercial creditor
banks' advisory coumittee to reduce the spread of their outstanding debt.
They accepted LIBOR plus 13/16ths of a point for old debt and 7/8ths of a
point for fresh money. They also agreed to use reserves accumulated in the
CSF for debt buybacks.  Debt conversions continued, and in seven months of
1988 they amounted to US$1.290  billion.   The cumulative amount since 1985
was US$4.60 billion. Conversions exceeded the additional borrowing, so the
external debt decreased to below US$20 billion.

The Public Sector
2.151    Implementation of the  SAP was preceded  by financial assistance
obtained from the IMF.  During  1983  Chile  abided by a two-year Stand-by
agreement.  It managed to  overcome  some earlier difficulties and complied
with the program's goals. The IMP continued fmnancing Chile, with an SDR
#750 EFF.  The goals of the programs to stabilize the economy under the DNF
agreement were highly coincident with those of the World Bank. This situa-
tion facilitated coordinated work between the government, the IMP, and the
Bank to harmonize the requirements of stability and structural adjustment.
The WFF stressed the significance of phasing out the preferential excwange
rate and currency swap operations of the Central Sank, import tariff reduc-
tion, a lower public deficit, and a cut In the country's demand for new
commercial funds.
2.152    Both the nfM and  the  Bank  shared  the  goal of a more efficient
public sector with better budgetary and institutional controls. The poli-
cies to reduce fiscal deficits became the basis of both stabilization and
adjustment programs. In the first case they contributed to controlling
inflation, and in the second they released funds required to susta,.n
measures for the medium-term reallocation of resources. This coordination
is always one of the difficult tasks a country faces when it engages in
stabilization and development policies, because it requires reducing the
budget deficit while at the same time raising private savings.
2.153    Chile's performance in this area proved successful.  In 1984 a tax
reform was initiated that provided fiscal incentives for reinvestment of
corporate profits. It also induced individuals to increase contributions
to the private pension fund system. That reform took place in January 1984
and was designed to stimulate the reinvestment of benefits by the gradual
elimination of a 401 surtax on corporate profits to 151 by 1986, with the
aim of cancelling  the  surtax  completely  in  1987.   Savings stimuli for
households consisted of deductions of 202 of funds invested in approved
shares, bank deposits, and other financial securities. Households could
also subtract--up to a 202 of their income--contributions to the private
pension funds in excess the minimum required by law. The yearly fiscal
costs from lost revenues were 0.61 of GDP for the period 1985-86. The
scheduled corporate surtax reduction was implemented, double taxation was
eliminated, and the applicability of the tax surcharge to public enter-
prises was confirmed. The fall In international prices, notably in 1986,
affected the revenues of ENAP (the National Petroleum Company) and CODELCO.
The adverse effect was in part counteracted by an improvement in collection
methods, (particularly in the VAT), by a postponement of personal tax re-
ductions, and by a new tax on the domestic consumption of gasoline. Be-
cause copper prices continued to climb and fiscal revenues expanded, the
government decided to release the tax pressure on the economy. Taxes on
credits and fuels were reduced, as well as those on corporate profits. The
VAT rate was lowered from 201 to 162 in 1988. These measures implied an
annual sacrifice of fiscal revenues equivalent to 31 of GDP from 1988 on-
wards (Table 2.23).

2.154    The government wanted to  Increase  public savings through current
expenditure restraint rather than through tax increases in order to avoid
hampering private savings. In addltion, measures introduced to ralse funds
could not create  an  anti-export blas.    The authorities reduced current

2.155    Public investment (Table 2.25) averaged 4.7S of GDP in 1982-83; it
rose steadily to 7.5Z in 1986 and was 7.31 in 1987. Investment was mainly
concentrated in productive sectors and infrastructure. In 1985-87, 291 was
oriented to mining  activities.  22S  to  electricity  and water,  202 to
transport, and 19X  to  housing.    CODELCO's  investment program of US$300
million was devoted to upgrading processing facilities for maintaining ore
grades in the Chuquicamata and El Teniente mines. In the energy sector, a
US$120 million investment initiated works in the Pehuenche and finalized
works in Camitillar, Alfalfar, and Colbun-Nachicura power plants. These
investments belong to a program destined to satisfy domestic energy demand
in the 1990s. Another US$100 million exploration and production investment
program may permit ENAP  to  counteract  the  decline  in oil production in
offshore facilities. Road, port, railroad, and agricultural infrastructure
investments are planned with financial assistance from the Bank and IDB.
To increase output in agriculture, the Government deferred large and low-
return irrigation projects and favored those projects that were small and
efficient. The SAP foresees that the PIP will amount to 7.51 of GDP up to
1992, thus helping to sustain expected annual GDP growth rates of between
4.5? and 5.

2.156    In January 1983 the  Government substantially increased its influ-
ence on Chile's productive resources.   It had to take over the administra-
tion of the largest private firms and banks to prevent their collapse.
Over a two-year period it returned them to private ownership and started to
divest itself of many state enterprises. Thus a program of reprivatization
was designed to increase the equity base of intervened debt-ridden institu-
tions and to distribute these equities among the largest possible number of
shareholders (Table 2.26). After legal settlement of the affairs of inter-
vened groups, which took place by the end of 1985, the sale of productive
firms proceeded at a rapid pace. By December 1986, over 902 of the produc-
tive assets of intervened groups had been sold to private investors. For-
eign investors started negotiations to purchase the largest brewery, as
well as INFORSA and COPEC, holding companies with interests in forestry and
energy.

2.157    By October 1986 privatization  of public enterprises meant collec-
tion of at least US$113.9 million estimated from 21,979 million (current)
pesos and an average exchange rate of 193.02 pesos per dollars 352 of the
total value of shares had been bought by the APPs, 141 by companies' em-
ployees, 282 by stock exchange investors, and 23? by users and others.
2.158    The reprivatization of Intervened  and  public enterprises has met
the Government's goals and had a good influence on the capital market. The
reallocation of resources from the public to the private sector was



- 57 -
directed to improve the management of these firms and to set new and trans-
parent rules of the game that would enhance competitiveness and help to
develop capital markets.
Financial Rehabilitation
2.159    The main features of the  financial sector were the Central Bank's
supporting credit lines, which were  designed  to reduce the debt burden of
the private sector and to improve the liquidity of the financial institu-
tions. Before the start of the SAP, the Central Bank moved to prevent the
collapse of  private  firm   and  banks  through  general  subsidized debt-
rescheduling programs, rates of exchange, and other measures to dissuade
the flight of domestic dollar deposits.    In June 1985 the Government com-
mitted itself to the phasing out, in six months, of the subsidized exchange
rate for debtors owing more than US$50,000.   In 1987 the remaining subsi-
dies--applied to dollar swaps and deposits and credit lines for reschedul-
ing purposes--would end. These measures were taken to reduce the Central
Bank's operational losses and to increase monetary flexibility. Both the
IMF and the Bank concurred on ending subsidies in order to consolidate the
stabilization policy.
2.160    In mid-1985 a program for reprivatization of two major banks under
state management was started. All these measures had a positive impact on
the economy. Financial profits reappeared, and lending was channeled to
viable firms. thus consolidating a healthy interaction between financial
and productive resources.    Nevertheless,  the  problem of absorbing heavy
financial losses produced by the recapitalization and reprivatization still
remains. These losses were reflected in the Central Bank's results and
could affect future growth by acting as a strong restraint on public ex-
penditure and expansion of consumption (Table 2.27).

2.161    The process of reprivatization  of  intervened banks was rapid and
is still in progress. By the end of 1986 the capital of the Banco de Chile
and the Banco de Santiago was sold to 25,000 shareholders. The Banco
Continental was returned to its  former  owners.   The Banco Concepcion and
the B8nco Internacional were sold to domestic investors after the state
absorbed these banks' losses. There were also mergers of institutions that
gradually passed on to private  hands.    The divestment scheme is still on
target. Intervened APPs are also being reprivatized. In some cases the
majority of capital was sold to multinational companies; in others only the
minority was transferred to foreign banks and insurance companies, and the
majority of shares remain widely dispersed.
2.162    The emergency loans to banks were capitalized, and the shares were
sold to the public, under a *popular capitalisml program involving heavy
losses and limits to the share of control that any one person could hold.
To improve their solvency, the banks were allowed to sell their nonperform-
ing portfolios to the Central Bank.    By August 1986, private ownership of
nearly 602 was achieved for the Banco de Chile and the Banco de Santiago.
2.163    Nevertheless, the  costs  of  financial  rehabilitation  have been
high. The efforts have been consistent with economic growth and controlled
inflation, but the banking system remains vulnerable to external shocks. A
fall in international prices for the main traded goods implies a sharp
reduction in public revenues. The CSF could initially dampen such effects,
but only for a limited time and to limited extent. This is a serious con-
straint for sustaining the pace of growth and necessarily affects consump-
tion and living standards.
2.164    To continue the  financial  reconstruction, the Government refused
demands for new rescheduling, and restricted paying dividends to pre-crisis
owners who had not fully repurchased obligations sold to the Central Bank.
As long as the Central Bank exerts a monitoring role on the purchase of
debt and continues its policy in the direction already mentioned, greater
efficiency will permit banks to accelerate their absorption of debts.
2.165    As the program reaches completion the administration will be freer
to pay more attention to medium-term financial issues, of which the most
pressing will be the channeling of private savings. Largely mobilized in
private pension funds, private savings are now almost solely dependent on
the indexed securities of  the  Government and  commercial banks.  In this
sense, private savings portfolios are undiversified.
2.166    The Government also strengthened  its corporate and banking legis-
lation by reinforcing institutions that pursue legal action against compa-
nies, administrators, or shareholders or that function legally against
third parties.
Sectoral Performance
2.167    Even with unfavorable terms of  trade and persistent high interest
rates, the Chilean economy recovered in 1984. After a consistent SAP begun
in 1985, the pace of growth was quickened to 52 in 1986-87 and rose to over



- 59 -
62 in 1988. Per capita consumption grew slightly, and investment grew at
nearly 202 annually in 1986-87.    Unemployment was reduced to below 92 in
1988.
2.168    Minns.  Chile is one  of  the  lowest-cost producers of copper in
the world. On the average, mining activity represents nearly 9X of GDP.
Total Chilean exports of goods amount to US$6.9 billion per year; nearly
half of these correspond to mining, and 43X of that to copper (Table 2.28).
Over 902 of copper exports are carried out by. CODELCO and ENAMI (National
Mining Company); more than 902 of Chile's coal is produced by ENACAR
(National Coal Company); 100X of nitrates and iodine are produced by
SOQUIMICH; and 1002 of Chilean iron originates from CAP. All these are
public enterprises. In 1986, the Treasury received US$0.7 billion in taxes
and dividends from public mining companies.   Except for ENAGAR, these com-
panies are profitable, enjoy a good financial condition, and have a low
level of indebtedness.

2.169    In 1970 the State took  over  the Schwager coal mines, operated by
ENACAR, to prevent their closure. Other smller mines were integrated into
ENACAR. The ENACAR group is now recovering from prolonged financial prob-
lems, and partial privatization is envisaged. Nitrate production was stag-
nant during the period, and the mines owned by the State worked at a loss.
Efficiency and price improvements reversed SOQUIMICH performance, and the

2.170    Chile's strategy in  copper  production  is deterained by CODELCO.
In 1984 CODELCO planned an investment program averaging just over US$400
million a year during 1986-90.    Fiscal constraints forced the corporation
to cut back its investment plan by Imposing an annual upper limit of US$300
million. The Ministry of Finance suggested that CODELCO to sell off some
of its assets to Increase its capital expenditures above the yearly limit.
Something similar may bappen with the expansion plans of RAMI . Investment
restraint may prevent the company's cost decreases and the achievement of
more production efficiency in small- and medium-scale mines.
2.171    Agriculture.  To stimulate  production,  the financial measures of
1983-84 permitted renegotiation of the debts of almost half of all agricul-
tural borrowers.   In  1984,  the  authorities  provided a one-year special
credit line to finance working capital with future crops as the only col-
lateral. This financial assistance--with exchange rate adjustments and a
support price--generated investment In the sector and more efficient import
substitution in 1984-86. The impact of .rade and exchange rate policies
was to induce increased production of export-oriented crops. Production of
principal crops grew annually as follows: cereals, 7.32; legumes and pota-
toes, -3.22; Industrial crops, 14.32.   As more investment was channeled to
the sector, the area under cultivation increased. Production also showed a

2.172    The Government established a  reference  price mechanism for wheat
and oils and supported sugar producers through a variable import tariff
system. A price band was established that was based on the experience of
the previous five years and eliminated extremely high or low prices. When
international prices exceed the maximum limit of the band, the import
tariff decreases proportionately until prices reach the international
level. This reference method was applied to only two coonodities, so the
market vas kept quasi-free.
2.173    IANSA (the National  Sugar  Industry,  Inc.)  was considered to be
efficient. Nevertheless, external obligations and subsidized international
prices forced the Government to impose a tariff surcharge on sugar imports,
imposed since 1984. The resulting price was supposed to reflect estimated
long-run international  costs,  based  on  ten-year  Caribbean  prices.  At
present, however, the sugar reference prices are below current long-run
Caribbean costs and prices. This discrepancy could threaten the allocation
of resources in sugar production and lead to inefficient utilization of
land in the future.
2.174    During the recovery  period,  farmers'  incomes were significantly
increased. The improved agricultural environment favored traditional crops
such as cereals, vegetables, and industrial crops. and cultivated area
increased (Table 2.30).

2.175    The experience of  1982-86  shows  that  farmers  reacted to price
signals. In the future, care must be exercised to prevent special purchas-
ing agencies from causing price distortions that cause inefficient alloca-
tion of resources.    Certain  buying  schemes may not reflect opportunity
costs and may distort resource allocation. Policies favoring traditional
activities may also impede diversification and the expansion of activities
with higher profits.    The  Government  initiated  a program for promoting
exports, and the role of PROCHILE in this regard is very important. Export



- 62 _
promotion can be supported by the creation of marketing companies able to
penetrate markets in the Pacific basin, North America, and Europe.
2.176    Export diversification was le  by  agricultural goods, foods, and
forestry products, and it reacted positively to exchange rate conditions
and drawback schemes. This process requires great attention so that diver-
sification consolidates in the long run. In this sense, long-term programs
are vulnerable to deterioration in the terms of trade and world interest
rates.
2.177    Forestry.   Forestry  plantations  have  expanded  at  the pace of
70,000 hectares a year since 1974. The Government created a private/public
forestry commission in 1985 to coordinate investment in the sector. Sus-
tained growth of radiata  pine  plantations  requires industrial and infra-
structure  investments.    Technological  improvements  are  already taking
place, and the larger companies  have  begun using heavy thinning and high
pruning as a normal practice.    The  commission projected an annual growth
rate of forestry output of 8.91  for  the period 1985-1990.  Growth in sawn
logs was expected to be 4.9Z a year, and pulpwood 162. Market studies have
shown that the quality of Chile's wood is low, and therefore price pros-
pects are not  optimistic.    The  country must  improve lumber quality by
establishing better processing facilities. Private investments toward this
goal have already started, initiated by domestic and foreign firms. The
infrastructure requirements imply modernization of road, rail, and port
facilities in order to handle the output volumes expected after 1990.
2.178    Manufacturing.  The  industrial  sector,  adapted  to sharp tariff
reductions in 1975-79, suffered from the overvaluation of the peso in
1979-82, and output  levels  declined  significantly.   The economic growth
that took place after 1983, with export-oriented features and the import
substitution accompanying that expansion meant that by the end of 1986
manufacturing output had reached levels achieved during the peak years
before 1983. The reduction of the uniform import tariff and the favorable
and stable exchange rate had a healthy effect on production. The only
problem that may restrict future growth is the condition under which new
investments are financed.
2.179    The impact of manufacturing incentives  has been to foster produc-
tion, and this has been achieved by increased utilization of idle capacity.
The conditions for obtaining finance for plant expansion require the future
stability of the economic program.  As  long as demand expands as a conse-
quence of the overall growth of  the economy, profit prospects will make it
easier to face market interest rates and to invest in medium-term projects.
This applies also to foreign capital that could be attracted by an expand-
ing domestic market.  Nevertheless,  when  general growth is interrupted by
an external shock affecting the economy, idle capacity reappears, and the
objective of consistent and efficient outward orientation may be blocked.
2.180    Social Sectors.  The impact  of  the  economic crisis was that the
government spent relatively more on social security reform and on UEPs.
Wages dropped significantly, and other social programs suffered cuts and



- 63 -
postponements. By 1987, real expenditures in health, education, and hous-
ing had not yet regained  1981  levels.    These trends began to reverse in
1988.
2.181    The Government's  main  achievements  in  the  social sectors also
included the followingt
*    The  government  decided  to  increase  the  efficiency  of
equipment rather than to raise personnel outlays in the
health area.
*    Emphasis was  placed  on  preventive  health  care.  Infant
mortality rates continued to declines in 1973 the rate was
652 of live births, and in 1986 it fell to 19.4Z. In
addition,  provisions  of  clean   water  and  of  sewerage
services  contributed  to  improving   the  health  of  the
population.
*    In the area of housing  there was important progress.  The
authorities provided 120,000 houses to low-income families
in 1984-86 and the program was continued and expanded with
the Bank's support.
III. EVALUATION OF THE SAP
3.01     This chapter supplements the appraisal  of Chile's SAP with a more
comprehensive evaluation than that given In Chapter II. A country's eco-
nomic performance under a SAP can be assessed from different anglles:
*    by comparison with  economic  behavior  during the previous
period;
*    by comparison with  the  economic  behavior  of other coun-
tries;
*    by comparison with the programmed behavior of the economy.
Although these comparisons would  enrich  one's  vision of economic perfor-
mance under the Chilean SAP, it cannot be ignored that they are essentially
counterfactual historical ezercises:    in  one  case  the standard is past
history; in another it is a different economy; in the third it is an imagi-
nary scenario.. The last approach, however, offers the advantage of repli-
crting the decision-making process and is amenable to a disaggregation of
t.e causes of differences between program and reality (see the Technical
Appendix). After an overview of Chilean economic policy and an analysis of
the policy components of the Bank's SALs, the evaluation utilizes elements
of all three approaches.
3.02     The SALs initiated in 1985 in support of the Government's SAP were
directed to modify severe balance of payments disequilibria and to create a
spontaneous reallocation of resources induced by a new process of market



- 64 -
liberalization ia order to help reverse the economic crisis of 1982-83.
The program almed to diversify exports away from the traditional dependence
on coppert to achieve sustained growth in output, domestic savings; and
investment; and, finally, to rehabilitate the financial system which was
seriously affected by the crash.    The  loans were used to finance imports
and to release pressure on the balance of payments, thus enabling implemen-
tation of the adjustment program.
3.03     The SAP differed from  the  libe:alization policies carried out in
1973-81, which followed the idea that distortions in the economy could be
eliminated by  first  removing  controls  on  capital  markets.   Financial
liberalization thus became the most important component of domestic policy.
Increases in real interest rates were expected to stimulate demand for
money and other financial assets, so that output could expand and--provided
money demand increased more than money supply--inflationary expectations
would gradually disappear. That view relied particularly on the ease of
capital flows and took for granted that productive structure would respond
quickly and efficiently to  financial  movements.   The permissive rules of
the game allowed firms to relate  among  themselves and to control banks in
order to collect funds  for  their  own  investment outlets.  High interest
rates, both charged to borrowers and paid to depositors stimulated external
borrowing. This context facilitated the channeling of funds to high-risk
investment ventures.   That  period  coincided with  growth in output, and
exports also responded positively.   In  the meantime, the vulnerability of
the economy was increasing and the peso appreciated; falling copper prices,
and higher costs of importing petroleum precipitated the crisis in 1982.
3.04     The consequences of the crisis  implied  going back on the process
of liberalization.   Controls  and  subsidies  reappeareds   in 1983 impost
tariffs went from 101 to 20X; in March 235 import items were subjected to a
152 surtaz; in September 1984 the peso was devalued (232), and import
tariffs were carried to a uniform 35? rate. The Government was in need of
fiscal revenues, but it was compelled to rescue firms and banks that had
been considerably weakened. In 1982 GDP declined by 142, and a year later
it fell by 0.72.
3.05     The impact on employment was tremendous.    By the end of 1982 un-
employment reached 24Z of the labor force. Difficulties derived from the
crisis required Stand-by loans agreements with the rMF and forced the pro-
vision of subsidies to avoid widespread collapse of enterprises and banks
and capital flight.   At  this  point  it was clear that the stabilization
program by itself could not resolve the major problems. A new approach to
adjustment was required. Its search evolved finally into the SAP.
3.06     The SAP included  a  set  of measures, particularly institutional,
the most important of which affected export promotion and the public and
financial sectors. Before analyzing its content, it can be said that in
general the SAP was directed to restore liberalization but in a more grad-
ual and thorough-going way, in a context of an outward-oriented policy.
The treatment of the financial  sector,  in particular, was to complete its
rehabilitation and to provide new rules of the game that would avoid the
troubles experienced during the previous experience.

A. ComDonents of Chilean Economic Policy
3.07     The economic programs lmplemented by the Chilean authorities since
1973 has experienced several modifications in shape and content. The ex-
perience can be characterized as a search for medium-term policies, at
least in certain time intervals, in order to achieve growth and eliminate
several structural constraints.
3.08     In evaluating the economic policies  included in the programs car.
ried out, one can  visualize  three main  components.   The first and most
important is the Government's role, in policy desipn and implementation.
The administration defines its program and provides the main framework of
measures. Within the framework, objectives are related to a set of instru-
mental variables on which the authorities rely to implement economic poli-
cy. According to the Government role and the type of programs implemented,
ezperience can be classified into three periods:
*    first liberalization, 1973-81;
*    economic crisis and transition, 1982-84;
*    the SAP, 1985-88.
A detailed analysis of the features of each general framewcrk and its
results is presented later In the section.
3.09     The second component of the programs is the role of the  INf.  The
need to stabilize the economy by improving the current account deficit and
reducing inflationary pressures was present during the whole period. The
I_N's financial assistance  implied  agreement with  the authorities with
respect to basic stabilization objectives and the means to achieve them.
The financial requirements necessitated definition of fiscal and monetary
policies consistent with the aims  adopted,  which could be monitored regu-
larly to determine the results of the programmed actions. in this sense
many of the structural objectives present in the Government's approach to
economic pclicy were shared by the IMF and monitoring was restricted to
ensuring that the policy instruments activated were the right ones. Here
the DIMF's conceptual framework of economic policy was important. Goals
were usually the reduction of the current account deficit and the infla-
tionary rhythm.    Policy  instruments,  however,  were  the exchange rate,
reduction in import protection, and the control of total domestic credit,
(particularly to the public .sector).  Monitoring was centered mainly on net
domestic assets of the financial system and on the size of public expendi-
ture.
3.10     The third  component  of  Chilean  economic  policy was the World
Bank's financial assistance and policy advice, notably in the adjustment
program since 1985 onward, once the SAP was recognized by the Government as
a pressing need. The general scheme of economic policy required to obtain
financial assistance from the Bank considered as goals the growth of GDP
and improvement in the balance  of payments.  Usually, the policy instru-
ments were fiscal' revenues and current Government expenditure, through



- 66 -
which public savings and the incremental access to foreign loans, both
public and private, could  be  manipulated.    This  approach cares for the
investment process and the achievement of sustained growth by combining
improvements in domestic savings and defining the role of foreign finance.
In the case of Chile, the Bank's contribution was to complement IMF support
once the administration had decided to implement a consistent SAP.
3.11     The new liberalization program  implied  a different strategy from
that applied after the catastrophic consequences of the 1982-83 crisis and
a return to the 1975_79 approach.   The growth supported by the Bank should
be based on the diversification of exports and on expansion of domestic
capacity to save and invest, and should be complemented by measures to
rehabilitate and reprivatize the financial  system.   The Bank's loans were
given to finance imports, thus to release pressures on the balance of pay-
ments, and this created sufficient flexibility to implement the SAP and
successfully manage the external  debt.    In  short,  the usual growth and
balance of payments goals considered by the Bank were maintained, but
emphasis put on the creation of conditions to ensure favorable evolution of
the economy in the medium term.
3.12     The three periods mentioned  before  showed  different uses of the
three policy components.  In  1973-81,  the main component in determining
economic policy was the Government's strategy of liberalization, strongly
complemented by foreign resources rather than by assistance from the IMF or
the Bank. The economic crisis and transition of 1982-84 brought redefini-
tions of economic policy on the part of the administration and an increas-
ing IMF role. The efforts of the authorities were not strong enough to
produce a consistent medium-term program during this period. Monetary
adjustments made to restore short-term improvements in the balance of pay-
ments and to reduce the inflation rate were clashed with attempts to follow
expansionary actions and with the reintroduction of protective fiscal
measures. The period 1985-88 showed a better balance among the three pol-
icy components, and this meant that the adjustment program could Include
different sets of goals and instruments in a consistent way. Perhaps
adjustment policies can or must be readapted in the future to ensure the
sustainability of stabilization and adjustment, but it is clear that the
policy package of 1985-88 was a good medium-term program that could harmo-
nize the stabilization and macroeconomic policies with structural modifica-
tions in the institutional and economic context.
First Liberalization, 1973-81
3.13     The economic situation of Chile  in  September 1973 was critical.
Output and employment were  falling while  the  annual  rate of inflation
soared to 1,000X. The Government and public sector enterprises were gener-
ating huge deficits. International reserves were negative and the country
was unable to service its external debt. The exchange rate was overvalued
and was supported by prevailing high levels of protection, both tariff and
nontariff. Ceilings in the monetary sector produced negative real interest
rates. There were many price controls, particularly on food and urban wage
goods. Wage adjustments were legislated, and a high level of social bene-
fits was financed by monetary expansion and foreign loans. Fiscal revenues



- 67 -
were weakened by many tax exemptions, tariffs, quantitative restrictions.
direct subsidies, and the acceleration of inflation.
3.14     The policies carried out since September 1973 were directed toward
producing rapid liberalization of the economy. The measures put the stress
on private initiatives and free market forces. The authorities emphasized
the subsidiary role of Government in the economic process. State interven-
tion was resitricted to cases in which divergences between social and pri-
vate benefits and  costs  prevailed.    Those  policies  aimed to eliminate
quickly distortions in price mechanisms.    The  economy was expected to be
opened to foreign trade, thus reducing to anti-export bias and tending to
improve resource allocation. A reform was conceived to establish a compet-
itive financial system in which the allocation of resources would be deter-
mined by forces of demand and supply and in which interest rates would
reflect this interaction.    The program  implemented  since 1973 also had
short-term stabilization objectives: to reduce inflation, to limit public
expenditures, and to achieve a rapid increase in international reserves.
3.15     The measures utilized to meet  the objectives were to free prices,
complemented by the massive adjustments of public enterprise prices and
fares and of other controlled prices.   The peso was devalued, the exchange
rate regime was simplified, and a crawling-peg system was adopted. Import
tariffs were sharply reduced. Interventions and requisitions of firms were
annulled, and the return of socialized enterprises to private owners was
implemented. The attack on public finances was based on substantial tax
Increases and long-term actions to reduce the size of expenditures and to
transfer responsibility for most resource allocation to private hands.
White- and blue-collar minimum wages and family allowances were unified.
Measures to mitigate heavy unemployment were taken; minimum employment
programs consisted of public works, wage subsidies to stimulate capacity
utilization, reforms of unemployment insurance, and manpower and training
programs.
3.16     A cornerstone of the  liberalization policy was the reconstruction
of the financial  system.    The  existing  legal  ceiling  on  the rate of
interest was progressively raised and ultimately eliminated. Monetary
correction clauses for financial obligations were legalized and exempted
from income  tax.    Central Bank  authority  over  all financial entities
receiving deposits from the public was strengthened. The Central Bank was
allowed to lend only to the  Government, commercial banks, and other finan-
cial institutions. The Superintendency of Banks coverage was extended to
supervise all financial entities (to become the Superintendency of Banks
and Financial Institutions, SlIP).    Development of multipurpose financial
institutions was encouraged through the relaxation of operating restric-
tions previously granted only  to  specialized  agents.   This measure gave
tremendous flexibility to the behavior of the financial system, the under-
lying idea being to increase competition and to take advantage of economies
of scale. Banking shares previously acquired by the State were sold back
to the private sector.   The  freeing  of financial activity was ensured by
the elimination of quantitative credit limits on commercial bank's lending
operations. Special credit lines from the Central Bank were progressively
eliminated.



- 68 -
3.17     Short-term instruments were  consistent with an austerity program
relying on orthodox monetary and fiscal policies and on depreciation of the
currency. Public expenditures were cut back, taxes were increased, and
credit was tightened.
3.18     The liberalization program can be viewed  as a move toward struc-
tural economic  change.    Policy modifications were  tremendous in their
effects, reflected in the Chilean authorities' inability to project the
future of the economy in  any  precise  terms.   The policy parameters that
gave shape to main behavioral relationships had changed drastically. The
liberalization efforic was strong and had impact on import elasticities,
capital output ratios, Input-output coefficients, tax collection percent-
ages, and so on.
3.19     A distinctive feature of  the  economlc  policy  of those days was
financial liberalization, which would facilitate the elimination of distor-
tions in the economy. Free interest rates were to result in positive real
rates and to stimulate savings.    Demand  for money was also regulated by
real interest movements, and so other financial assets would follow suit.
An increased and flexible set of financial assets permitted economic agents
to reverse the negative effects of the long-run excess demand for credit
produced by previous negative real rates of interest.
3.20     The effects of  the  program were  positive,  particularly in the
short term. Output and noncopper exports expanded, and the whole economy
seemed to move toward the goals pursued.   There was a growth process, con-
stantly linked to a short-run austerity policy, that caused the alternation
of recessionary situations. This was also the result of deep changes in
resource allocation. Restrictions to entry into financial activities were
eliminated in the hope of creating more competition for deposits from the
public. These measures, however, led to a situation in which money was
channelled not only according to healthy banking principles, but also to
the requirements of firms that controlled the banks. The mechanism pro-
vided many enterprises with means of obtaining finance for their own in-
vestment outlets. This permissiveness created availability of funds that
could be invested  in very  risky  projects.    A  main  deviation of this
approach was that the difference between the cost of credits in the domes-
tic market and abroad created a strong bias in favor of external borrowing.
There was an important leverage effect in obtaining external finance from
abroad. The rapid expansion of the domestic financial sector also inter-
acted with the increase in borrowing from external markets. The official
expectation that domestic Inflation had to converge to the pace of foreign
inflation--to the extent that demand for money kept rates of interest high
and that the exchange rate pressed Internal prices to slow their growth-
-resulted in an appreciation of the peso.
3.21     Thus, the Chilean economy was  slipping  into  a higher degree of
vulnerability. Quite apart from the traditional volatility of the external
sector--due to its dependence on international copper prices--there were
evolving two additional types of vulnerability.   One, domestic in nature,
derived from the Increased weakness of the financial sector. Credits were



-'69 -
allocated In a way that eroded banks' solvency. Economlc fluctuations made
their impacts felt through the expanded net of borrowing. It became clear
that many resources had been misallocated because of a sense of adventure,
overoptimistic  expectations,  and--mainly--rules  of  the  Same  that were
excessively permlssive.   This potential  vulnerability became actual vith
the devastating effects of the 1982 crisis. The second vulnerability was
the accumulation of external debt, whose service set an important con-
straint on the balance of payments and on growth. The liberalization pro-
gram clearly had positive effects in several areas, but it also had strong
social costs. The Government tried to reduce unemployment directly, in an
attempt to release some of the pressures on those sectors without abandon-
ing orthodox demand restraints to reduce inflation. However, the vulner-
abilities depicted above were so Important as to jeopardize the sustain-
ability of growth.
Economic Crisis and Transition, 1982-84
3.22     The appreciation of the  peso,  the  fall of copper prices, higher
costs of imported oil--these were important factors that contributed to
precipitation of the crisis in  1982.    The fixed exchange rate with tight
domestic credit did not produce the expected convergence of prices to
external inflation. Moreover, wage and cost indexations were applied in
the same belief. In June 1982 wage indexation was abolished, the peso was
devalued, and the depreciation schedule for the following 12 months was
announced. The devaluation provoked important capital losses because of
the existing indebtedness. Banks were weakened and the authorities had to
liquidate some and intervene others.  Unemployment rebounded to 24Z of the
labor force by the end of 1982. The foreign debt of the private sector was
US$1.6 billion in 1978 and USS8.1 billion in 1982. A fixed exchange rate,
combined with free capital movements and high domestic interest rates gene-
rated a systematic appreciation of the peso. Although copper prices were
falling, interest payments on the external debt amounted to nearly 40Z of
exports. This situation affected Chill's creditworthiness, and finally its
access to foreign resources wat closed.
3.23     The consequences of the crisis  were  a  retreat in the process of
liberalization. That process was interrupted more because of circumstances
than because of a modified mentality in the Government's approach to eco-
nomic policy. The economic and financial crisis forced the authorities to
intervene to avoid a general collapse of firms and financial institutions.
At the same time the country was experiencing serious disequilibria in the
balance of payments.  That is why  in this period there Was some confusion
in the economic approach as far as the Government was concerned, and the
IDF played an important role both in supplying financial assistance and in
helping to clarify the main lines of current economic policy. The two-year
US$500 million Stand-by agreement with the IMF at the beginning of 1983
opened a new stage in which stabilization measures had to continue and
played an important role in the evolution toward the Chilean SAP. The
IMF's net credit to the country rose from US$6 million in 1982 to US$600
million in 1983. In the transition period there were external debt negoti-
ations between the Government and international banks. Amortization pay-
ments for 1983-84 were rescheduled over eight years, with four years'



- 70-
grace, and new loans were obtained. The main problems then were the conse-
quences of a major economic crisis expressed, among other ways, by disequi-
librium in the balance of payments. The IMF'o fimancial assistance, guided
by its mandate to provide finance to eliminate such short-term disequilib-
ria, implied a definite stance of economic policy to restore payments equi-
librium and stop the general rise in prices.
3.24     The policy model implicit  in  the  DMF approach works on domestic
monetary equilibrium and its connections with the foreign sector of the
economy. It takes as its goals an increase in international reserve,
(usually produced by improvements in current account deficits), the slowing
down of the inflation rate, and the expansion of domestic credit to the
private sector. These goals are conceptually linked to policy instruments
that the responsible authority has to manage in order to achieve the pro-
posed-objectives. Usually these are the ceiling to domestic credit, the
subceiling determined by domestic credit from the Central Bank to the pub-
lic sector, and the exchange rate.    In certain cases, the IMF sets floors
to the amount of foreign exchange reserves that the Central Bank can hold
and limits to the short-term external borrowing of the public sector.
These limits are supposed to function in the following way. First, the
exchange rate is manipulated to provide stimuli to exports and disincen-
tives to imports in a context of liberalization. The IMF is more concerned
with the exchange rate than with import tariffs and export tax reductions
for budgetary reasons. The control of domestic credit affects conditions
in the money market. As internal credit hits the ceiling, increases in
international reserves derived from current account corrections will have
to meet the increased demand for money. If increased money demand does not
keep pace with the expected rise in money supply, then domestic credit
should decline in order to permit equilibrium in the money market without
fueling inflationary pressures.
3.25     In the case of Chile, the situation can be depicted in the follow-
ing terms. The current account deficit as a proportion of GDP was 14.51 in
1981 and 9.52 in 1982. For 1983, the policy goals were 7.22 for 1983 and
4.72 a year later.   These  percentages  implied a negative current account
balance of US$1,602 million in 1983 and no precise figure (a range between
negative US$1,088 million and negative US$1098 million) for 1984. Pro-
grammed net international reserves of the Central Bank were negative US$485
million in 1983 and zero in 1984.   The targeted rate of inflation for 1983
was 25S and was to be less than that in 1984. The ceiling to internal
credit was fixed at an increase of 332--measured as net domestic assets of
the Central Bank--for 1983. The limits on domestic credit to the Govern-
ment were expected to bring the overall deficit of the nonfinancial public
sector down to 1.7Z of GDP in 1983 and to eliminate it the following year.
This fiscal policy was centered on achieving improvements mainly through
cuts in current expenditures and increases in the operating surpluses of
public enterprises. The devaluation of the peso was ongoing since mid-
1982, and this meant moving from a crawling peg to a floating exchange rate
and then going back to a crawling peg.



- 71-
3.26     The framework of  economic  policy was restricted to implementing
measures aimed to achieve short-tetm goals.    There was a lack of definite
medium-term objectives, and complications from the financial crisis that
detonated in early 1983 confused even more the consistency of actions in
pursuit of stabilization.    The  economic  program  did not anticipate the
financial crisis of 1983. Therefore the adoption of comprehensive measures
was delayed. Later, different views within the Government about how to
cope with the problems confused matters  further.   The crisis made it more
difficult to maintain a policy of  demand  restraint.   The handling of the
exchange rate did not prove adequate and ended in further appreciation of
the pesos more forceful adjustment of that variable could have aggravated
the financial crisis. The process of liberalization was set back. Con-
trols and subsidies reappeareds in 1983 Import tariffs went up from 102 to
202; in March, 235 import items were subjected to a 152 surtax; in
September the peso was devalued, and import tariffs were again raised, this
time to a uniform level of 35?. The government was in need of revenues but
was compelled to rescue firms and banks on the verge of collapse. In 1984
the current account deficit increased because of negative external shocks
and slippage in fiscal and exchange rate policies. Fiscal policy became
expansionary in mid-1983 and continued so a year later. The fiscal deficit
as a proportion of GDP rose to almost double the targeted value for 1983,
and in 1984 it  reached  4.4S.    As  mentioned elsewhere, the quasi-fiscal
deficit exceeded the fiscal deficit in those years. GDP fell 0.7Z in 1983
and rose 6.3? in 1984.   Inflation was  slower than programmed in 1983 and
maintained its pace in 1984.
3.27     The general outcome of the  economic  program  can be summed up as
follows.
-   Success in growth and  in  the  current bal;i .e of payments
adjustment, particularly in 1983 (5.4? of GDP versus a
target of 7.22) was attributable to the residual effects of
structural reform policies pursued in the 1970s.
*   The main  result  of  the  1982-84  experience was official
recognition of the main features of the adjustment problems
and the need for a medium-term strategy: at this point it
was clear that the stabilization program alone could not
resolve major economic problems.
*   The stabilization program was  flawed  in design and imple-
mentation. The monitoring function was incomplete. Limits
were not set for private short-term debt and for the opera-
ting deficit of the Central Bank (Table 3.1).

The lack of conditionality and monitoring permitted the inflow of short-
term foreign capital, which was attracted by the fixed exchange rate and
tight financial policies. This type of capital also financed the rising
current account deficit in 1984.   In  addition, the Central Bank directly
attracted short-term capital through subsidies on forward and swap opera-
tions and through a premium on foreign exchange deposits.
The SAP, 1985-88
3.26     The SAP was initiated in 1985. The G6kernment decided to confront
the medium-term problems and implemented a program that included both IMP
and World Bank lending. The three components of economic policy performed
their complementary role with regard to the stabilization and structural
changes required. The IM provided a US$750 million EBY, later extended by
US$75 million; the Bank granted three successive SALs, for a total of
another US$750 million. The  13W-type stabilization policy alone presented
as its goals an improvement in the current account deficit, a decline in
the inflation rate, and a given level of domestic credit for the private
sector; its instrumental variables were total domestic credit (as a ceil-
ing), credit directed to the public sector, and an exchange rate adjust-
ment. The Bank's polLcy, in contrast, stressed medium-teml changes to
consolidate sustained growth.   Bank policy  presented  as  its goals GDP
growth and improvement in international reserves, derived from a better
current account situation.  These  goals were  to  be attained though the
following instrument variabless current expenditures of the public sector,
fiscal revenues, and foreign savings (which were intended to fill the gap
produced by insufficient domestic savings). Given behavioral relationships
such as the savings rate, the marginal propensity to import, and incremen-
tal capital-output ratios, the Bank's financial assistance would generate
the required additional investment and raise the level of economic activ-
ity. This is an extremely simplified version of the basic variables taken
into account under economic policy guidelines of the multilateral agencies.
3.29    Nevertheless, the combination of these two approaches to economic
policy does not produce a simple sum of both recommendations. In fact,



- 73 -
they interact with each other and generate a third approach in which sta-
bilization and structural measures are intertwined. In theoretical terms,
that given economic models produce Independently certain numbers for target
and lnstrumental variables In the IMF  and  in the Bank approaches does not
imply that these numbers persist when both economic programs are merged.
It may happen that the number of instrument variables exceeds the number of
targets, thus allowing more flexibility in the choice of strategies. For
Instance, targets include a reduction In inflation and an Increase in
international reserves, on the one hand, but GDP growth was also incorpo-
rated. To put into operation such a policy, which now regards objectives
of the kind In the Bank's approach, implies the use of instrumental vari-
ables such as fiscal revenues, current public expenditures, total domestic
credit and its distribution between public and private sectors, and ex-
change rate manipulation.    The  economic  policy  problem  usually has a
limited number of targets aad a larger number of instruments. To avoid
indeterminacy and incompatibilities in the implementation of policies, the
authorities treat a number of instruments as targets. The number of re-
maining instruments equals the number of previous targets and new targeted
instruments, and therefore it is possible to approach consistently the
solution of the economic policy problem.
3.30     This design closely resembles that  of Chile's economic policy for
1985-88. The SAP had as goals (see Table 3.2) real GDP growth (32 in the
first three years and 3.52 in 1988) and a declining expected rate of infla-
tion (starting with 25Z in 1985 and reaching 122 in 1988). The current
account deficit as a percentage of GDP was expected to change from 7.12 in
1985 to 1.8 in 1988. The exposition of main targets in Table 3.2 explains
only part of the interconnection between the DMP and the Bank approaches.

3.31     The role of the Bank was to facilitate and support the application
of structural adjustment measures.    In most  cases these objectives were
flexible, since they could not be targeted precisely in advance. The new
adjustment program was directed to modify severe disequilibria and to
creace spontaneous reallocations of resources by a new process of market
liberalization that could modify, in the medium-term factors causing pay-
ments imbalances. The program aimed to diversify exports to break the
dependence on copper. GDP growth had to be founded on increased domestic
.savings and investment and on the rehabilitation of firms and banks and new
rules of the game. This approach was more cautious then the one carried
out between 1973 and 1981. It was more gradual and much more careful about
consistency. The Bank's SALs provided finance to facilitate imports and to
release pressures on the balance of payments.
3.32     The authorities showed a  strong  commitment  to  the SAP and they
utilized the instruments of economic policy in a consistent way. Wage
increases were moderated, and the exchange rate was managed flexibly.
Tariff reductions and other export incentives contributed to creating an
atmosphere of growth. In the public sector. investment increased both in
quantity and quality, and confidence in management was restored. The pol-
icy of reducing fiscal deficits continued in the form of restraint in
current public expenditures and a more appropriate pricing policy for state
enterprises. Care was also given to preventing sudden falls in demand, in
the form of PIPs that could be activated if needed. Monetary policy was
consistent with reducing inflation and with balance of payments objectives.
The I)F continued to monitor net domestic assets of the Central Bank and,
quarterly, official international  reserves.    Among the medium-term meas-
ures, the Central Bank curtailed quasi-fiscal subsidies, and this contrib-
uted to reducing its operational deficit.   In what follows, the main areas
of the program are analyzed.
B.  Policy Components of the SALs
3.33     This section evaluates  policies  and progress  in the three main
areas of the SAP supported by the Bank's SALs: export promotion, public
sector savings and investment management, and rehabilitation of the finan-
cial sector.
Export Promotion Policies
3.34     These policies were  designed  to  create incentives for exporters
and to eliminate controls and subsidies connected with the exchange rate so
as to induce and sustain a medium-term supply response. The main stimulus
was bringing the exchange rate to a realistic level and periodically ad-
justing it in correspondence with domestic and external inflation. Tariff
reduction was brought about in steps.   This time the movement intended not
to affect suddenly important sources of fiscal revenues and not to have an
impact in a context of restrictive macroeconomic policy.
3.35     There were collateral incentives to promote noncopper exports, and
improvements in taxation schemes, such as regulations and procedures to



- 75 -
return to exporters the VAT, were also made to favor exporters. Reductions
in the relative inconvenience of using imported inputs subject to tariffs
became operational when drawbacks of  import tariff payments were permitted
to exporters. The revision of decree law 1,226 and 409 expanded the tariff
rebate regime to include indirect exports in the drawback system. Another
type of collateral action to promote nontraditional exports was focused on
the financial sector. A legal framework for export credit insurance and
partial guarantees for small exporters was established.
3.36     A measure agreed with  the  Bank  was  the  creation of the Cooper
Stabilization Fund (CSF) to stabilize exchange rate movements and dampen
the monetary effects of fluctuations in international copper prices. In
1988 reserves for that purpose accumulated, and part of them were used for
foreign debt buybacks. In other areas of production, there were policies
to restrict the use of support prices to a minimum number of products
(sugar, cereals). New legislation gave flexibility to the export promotion
agency, PROCHILE, in assisting exporters in their efforts to identify and
consolidate foreign markets.
3.37     Export promotion  policies  were  implemented  consistently.   The
measures in most cases were complementary, making for exemplary experience.
The economy underwent a period of steady growth, and the expansion of non-
copper exports was  considerably  higher  than  expected.  When evaluating
results, however, one must take into account the fact that the previous
liberalization program (1973-81) also produced growth in nontraditional
exports and in import substitution. The present issue is to know how much
of the economic expansion depended on still important primary exporting
activity and on foreign capital inflows.    Put in other words, how vulner-
able is a steady-growth economy such as Chile's if world copper prices fall
and the balance of payments  situation  worsens?    The SAP has to create a
basis for reducing this vulnerability, and when this occurs the conditions
for sustainable economic growth will  be  ensured.    It is obvious that it
takes time and concerted activity in terms of economic policy to reach
market size and permanency, implying long-term modifications of comparative
advantages. This qualification opens the debate to further considerations
of medium-term economic policy that would create safeguards against vulner-
ability. The scope should include future resource allocations to produce
permanent alterations in the  productive  structure.   This means much more
than using idle capacity. It is concerned with the expansion of new, addi-
tional, diversified, and more efficient capacity.
3.38     At this point it is  important  to consider the role of incentives
and tariff protection in the long-run allocation of resources. Exports
develop together with some import-substituting  activities.   As far as the
latter do not generate an antiexport bias, they can be considered effi-
cient. However, those activities compete with other production in the use
of scarce resources and then influence prices and quantities. It follows
that, in order not to create distortions in production for local and for-
eign markets, under competitive conditions export subsidies must equal
import tariffs. This excludes cases in which an export activity faces a
less than infinitely elastic demand for its commodities and there is an



- 76 -
optimal tariff determination. Under competitive conditions, in which Indi-
vidual producere have no power to Influence prices, the treatment of export
subsidies and tariffs  is  Important  in  detenrmaing  future allocation of
resources in production and consumption.    The neutrality of subsidies and
tariffs ensures efficient allocation; it equates at the margin the cost of
export promotion with the cost of import substitution In order to create
additional external revenues.
3.39     So far the incentives introduced  to  release the market from pre-
existing controls have had a positive effect on export growth. But to
maintain consistency in the medium-term there must be a defined program of
incentives and tariff adjustments that is consistent with efficient
resource allocation in production and with consolidation of new comparative
advantage.   Reducing  the  relative weight  of  primary comodity exports
requires a tremendous effort in expanding nontraditional exports. Other-
wise diversification may suffer in the face of contingent negative external
shocks.  Chile has  done well with    removing quantitative restraints to
trade and with the imposition of a uniform tariff that tends to distribute
effective protection evenly. A movement toward free trade can be seen here
and in the introduction  of  export  subsidies.   This movement corresponds
with a depreciation of the exchange rate in order to reach equilibrium in
the balance of payments.   Subsidies  can be represented by credit and tax
preferences. The issue is that, in order to maintain a consistent set of
policies in the medium-term, greater attention should be given to the way
in which the exchange rate is adjusted and its interrelation with the
existing protective structure.   Future import-substitution activities will
emerge, and these should not develop antiexport biases. A long-run problem
is  to  determine  hoc  to  modify  incentives  and  introduce  additional
institutional changes consistent with a rapid but smooth reallocation of
resources that will alter comparative advantage in the "right' way. The
SAP as it affects export promotion should be maintained in order to create
defenses against external shocks to the balance of payments. A policy
strategy should be designed because the interconnection between this
economic area and public finance is substantial.
Public Sector Management
3.40     During the 1985-88 SAP  the main  objectives of fiscal management
were two-fold: to achieve public savings equivalent to 4.8? of GDP and to
sustain public investment at a level of 7.5? of GDP. The policy of mone-
tary stabilization required increasing the operational surpluses of public
enterprises and improving revenues; the main line of attack has been cur-
rent expenditure restraint.   The  stabilization measures implied agreement
with the DMF on views that the Bank also shared completely. In this case
parsimony meant to apply adjustments to salaries and pensions that were
lower than cost of living   and smaller transfer payments for unemployment.
Public investment rose, however, and since 1986 has surpassed 72 of GDP.
investment was concentrated on productive sectors and infrastructure; low-
return projects were postponed, and emphasis was placed on high-return
outlets. The National Planning Office, ODEPLAN, participated actively in
the evaluation and approval of profitable projects.



- 77 -
3.41     Although not an IMF or World Bank conditioaality, reprivatization
of state enterprises was another important item in the set of measures
taken by the goverament to put its finances in order. The reallocation of
resources from public to private sectors was expected to improve the man-
agement of those firms.
3.42     Another line of policy in public sector administration was changes
in th. tax system. The Government's aim was to step up public savings by
expenditure restraint rather than by hardening the tax burden. There were
improvements in VAT  collection.    The  additional fiscal revenues derived
from the expanded value of copper exports permitted relieving the tax
pressure. Import tariffs could be lowered successfully, and this was done
for taxes on  credits  and  fuels.    Tax  reductions  applied to corporate
profits and the VAT rate diminished from 202 to 162. The fiscal cost of
tax reform was at last 32 of GDP.
3.43     The positive effects of  these modifications on economic activity
contributed to reinforcing growth and stability, since inflation declined.
However, these results were also facilitated by the positive impact that
international prices had on the balance of payments and public finance.
since the main exporter of primary goods is CODELCO, a state enterprise.
Other lines of action were the initiation of studies to improve management
of state enterprises.   In  practice,  a  consistent policy of state firms'
pricing and improved management permitted higher operational profits from
these companies. The administration of public finance in the context of
the SAP was successful. Kost of the measures followed from requirements of
stabilization policies necessary to comply with INP conditionalities. In
this respect, short-term policies were directed to contain the public defi-
cit. The tools for influencing the general rise in prices and the current
account deficit were to increase revenues and decrease expenditures. This
action was directed toward the primary deficit, (that is, the noninterest
deficit).
3.44     According to definitions of deficits used by international insti-
tutions, the primary deficit plus real interest payments (real domestic and
nominal foreign) equal the operational deficit; the operational deficit
plus inflation correction equal public nonfinancial sector borrowing; and
public sector borrowing requirements equal expenditure less revenue. The
primary deficit measures how current actions affect public net indebted-
ness. To evaluate the sustainability of deficit reductions, it is impor-
tant to evaluate the behavior of the deficit. Chile's measures were mainly
directed to raise revenues by increasing the operational surpluses of state
enterprises and to expand tax collection by improving efficiency in the
process. Current expenditure restraint was the most important factor, and
this did not prevent the expansion of public investment. The Government's
policy was concentrated on avoiding financing the total deficit by money
creation; it was done by increased public and foreign savings. Since 1983
the quasi-fiscal deficit was 6Z of GDP.   In 1985 it climbed to 13Z, and in
1986 it declined to 10. The efforts at rehabilitation and reprivatization
generated severe disequilibria that had to be financed with external funds.
The foreign debt includes expenses that only could be repaid in the future



- 78 -
and the Government will have to make available the necessary revenue. From
a short-temn point of view, the evolution of the primary deficit is impor-
tant to foresee the trend in closing the gap, but it is not itself suffi-
cient to predict the sustainability of the program in connection with the
required relation between future revenues and expenditures.
3.45     The Bank concurred with the IMP in the observance of stabilization
measures. The SAP was directed to remove obstacles to medium- and long-
term growth, such as distortions in productive incentives, overvalued
currency, price ceilings and controlled interest rates and credit, import
tariffs, and subsidies. In this sense the Bank expected the program to
open a new liberalization period.    The positive impact of external shocks
allowed improvement in the public imbalance between expenditure and revenue
without increasing the tax burden  on  the  economy.  There was a harmonic
connection between structural adjustment and stabilization objectives in
the sense that many of the trade-offs between policy instruments did not
pose serious  problems.    Sometimes  over-reliance  on  domestic borrowing
implies high rates of interest with reductions of private investment,
whereas excessive dependence on foreign finance leads to currency apprecia-
tion, which worsens the current account deficits. Chile was able to avoid
money creation, and thus it could reduce the inflation rate. Good external
conditions--both in foreign trade and lower interest rates--released pres-
sures on public sector management, permitting the fulfillment of objectives
in that area by making less operative the obvious trade-offs between fis-
cal, monetary, and exchange rate policies.
3.46     However, the SAP still  lacks  a  structural  view of the deficit-
handling aspects that will persist in the long run unless additional cor-
rective measures are  taken.    Such  a  structural  view, should take into
account--through conservative estimates--the dependence of fiscal revenues
on copper exports that still exists.   A long-run policy should contemplate
reforms that would consolidate a permanent revenue and expenditure struc-
ture consistent with reduction of the structural deficit in the future. So
far the SAP has succeeded in the implementation of measures directed to
liberalize the economy and facilitate  growth.    This was done by means of
institutional changes that put the growth process in motion. It was evi-
dent to the Bank that sustainability had to be ensured. That task has to
be carried out by programming future revenues and expenditures and taking
due account of external shocks and their likely effects on public sector
management and on external debt. Laying the ground work for sustainability
involves more than considering primary fiscal deficit trends. It implies
the normalization of revenues and expenditures by relaxing the tension in
the trade-off between budgetary requirements and trade policies. On the
revenue side, it means moving gradually to a structure closer to the one
existing in industrial countries where income taxes play a more important
role. The economy must be prepared to meet and curb future difficulties
arising from eventual external  shocks.    The burden of rehabilitation and
reprivatization has to be explicitly managed through time, and its impact
adequately programmed. The Bank's strategy was based on the idea that
resumption of economic growth is a prerequisite to creditworthiness.
Financial support has been given in the form of fast disbursement and flex-
ible utilization of funds.

3.47     There were also social components  of the SAP that were emphasized
more in the later course of  implementation.   The Bank also catalyzed fur-
ther finance from commercial banks.    Perhaps  a  cost of introducing few
conditionalities has been to maintain the SAP within the boundaries of its
medium-term application. The Bank was, rightly, interested primarily in
putting the process in motion, action that in itself has enhanced long-term
sustainability. However, much of the work for sustainability will still
have to be performed by the Government, outside the period of the SALs.
Financial Sector Policies
3.48     The main financial policy  objective  in  the framework of the SAP
was to complete the rehabilitation of the corporate and banking system and
to provide sound rules of the game that could give transparency and normal-
ize financial activity in  free market  conditions.    The weakness of the
previous liberalization process, started in 1973, was the permissive condi-
tions prevailing in the financial system. Great efforts were required from
the Government to bring order back to that seriously affected market.
These included the return to subsidies which finally hampered the correct
functioning of capital markets.    The  SAP was  conceived to complete the
rehabilitation process and to remove the subsidy structure supported by the
Central Bank, in  its  preferential  exchange  rates  for  dollar swaps and
deposits.  The action was  to  stop  all  preferences and to accelerate the
recovery of losses by private banks' repurchases of their portfolios.
3.49     A second policy line was to increase the surveillance and monitor-
ing of financial institutions to ensure their healthy functioning. New
legislation was introduced to ensure transparent control by stockholders
and to limit the participation  of  related  firms.   In the past financial
crisis, the cross-participation of firms through channeling bank funds to
their own investment projects weakened financial stability by increasing
risks of insolvency. Therefore, the Superintendency of Banks was strength-
ened and its functions expanded to control the financial sector.
3.50     Third, a set of legal reforms was put in operation to consolidate
the rehabilitated financial  system.    The  banking  law  introduced a new
deposit guarantee scheme relating the responsibilities of the Central Bank,
bank shareholders, and depositors.   Decree  law. 3,500 was also amended to
permit enhanced participation of pension funds in equity markets. Insur-
ance company and mutual fund regulations were reinforced with prudential
portfolio guidelines about diversification and limits to related-party
investments.
3.51.   The measures taken in  the financial sector, mainly institutional,
were directed to achieve a normalization of the activity in the long run.
The efforts of rehabilitation and reprivatization have been successful,
since financial sector activity  has  been  normalized.    The costs of the
success have seriously affected the level of public indebtedness and are
financed with external savings. No detailed information is available about
these costs and their financing over the future.



- 80 -
3.52     chile's management of foreign debt has also been remarkable.  The
SAP was designed with the definite aim of controlling the growth of debt
and debt service. After a  period  of rescheduling and repricing, the Gov-
ernment succeeded in repurchasing part of its obligations. Chile, which is
considered as one of the highly indebted Latin American countries, managed
to bring its debt down to around the size of GDP and then to further reduce
it. The consisteany of the SAP and the handling of external debt permitted
the country to improve its creditworthiness significantly.
3.53     In the area of  short-term policy, the administration was careful
to increase the money supply only vhen growth in money demand required it.
Thus there was no room for stimulating inflation. Control was also exerted
on additional domestic credit to private and public sectors. Besides, I10
monitoring was centered on the management of net domestic assets of the
Central Bank and the supervision of quarterly targets for official interna-
tional reserves. The rehabilitation program ended in 1987, and it was at
various times complemented by a tight monetary policy in order not to lose
ground in pursuing of  stabilization  objectives.   Because the authorities
did not claim resources by issuing currency, inflation was controlleds it
came down from 26.41 in 1985 to 12.31 in 1988, with a short upward movement
in 1986.
C. Historical Comparisons
3.54     This section presents a  comparison of economic performance during
the last three periods of Chilean economic policys the first liberaliza-
tion, 1973-81;, economic crisis and transition, 1982-84; and the SAP,
1985-88.
First Liberalization, 1973-81
3.55     The liberalization period 1973-81 was characterized by three dif-
ferent phases of the evolution of economic activity: recession, recovery,
and boom (Table 3.3). The recessive situation prevailing in 1973 remained
until 1975. GDP attalned a depressed level in 1973; experienced a slight
increase (to 1.02) in 1974; and declined again (to 12.9Z) a year later. In
those years, private consumption and gross domestic investment decreased
significantly. This can be seen particularly in fixed investment, since
the increase in gross domestic investment in 1974 was affected by accumula-
tion of inventories. Exports went on expanding while the reduction in the
level of economic activity produced an important decline in imports. The
behavior of the trade balance prevented a larger fall in GDP. The liberal-
ization program intended to trim the role of the State, to lower inflation,
and to liberalize trade And financial activities. The start of liberaliza-
tion Implied keeping recessive conditions by demand restraint. However,
in 1976 the situation reversed and the fruits of economic policy showed in
a rebound of economic activity.

Lo At market primc.
3.56     The economic recovery took place between 1976 and 1979.  Financial
liberalization started in 1975, and since then credit was allocated as a
result of demand and supply. In 1975 the exchange rate was unified; first
a crawling peg was adopted, followed by a preannounced minidevaluation
system. Import tariffs were gradually cut down, to a uniform 102 rate in
1979. Copper prices were low, and restrictions restrained the growth of
trade. However, cheaper imported inputs and credits with low rates of
interest allowed the expansion of noncopper exports, so Import subntitution
and nontraditional exports took place in a significant way. Liberalization
stimulated exports of forestry, fishmeal, and fruits. Agricultural activi-
ties shlfted from traditional products such as cereals, oilseeds and sugar-
beet toward export-oriented crops such as fruits, timber, and vegetables.
Manufacturing shrunk relatively In the beginning of the program but later
regained its share, with a shift toward wood products, fishmeal. and non-
ferrous metals and away from textiles, chemical items, and nonmetal goods,
which suffered from competition with Imports. Improved efficiency in pro-
duction stimulated the recovery of 1976-79. Competition with foreign firms
induced domestic companies to modernize their old equipment through small
investments and adoption of modern management techniques.  The increase in
productivity fostered output. Fixed investment began to grow in 1977, and
in 1978 its level surpassed the amount attained In 1974. The utilization
of idle capacity and its slow expansion was taking place through higber
productivity. Thus, despite the recovery, the rate of unemployment re-
mained above previous historical standards for Chile. The rationalization
of labor costs implied that private and public sectors were laying workers
off. The rate of unemployment was above 10X. Real interest rates were
kept high, and this stimulated external borrowing. The Government's labor
policy went into effect In 1977, with automatic ex post indexation of
wages. The Chilean peso appreciated; Imports were stimulated; and the
competitiveness of exports was eroded.



- 82 -
3.57     The years 1980 and 1981 showed a  boom. The rate of growth of GDP
declined as the expansion was  reaching  its  end.   The pegging of the ex-
change rate with the opening of capital movements brought about important
trade deficits (Table 3.4). For example, the resource balance in 1979 was
-US$597 million; in 1980 it was US$1,056 million, and a year later it Was
-US$3,367 million.   In  addition,  interest  payments  abroad jumped from
US$583 million in 1979 to US$919 million in 1980 to US$1,423 million the
next year. Public savings declined in 1981, foreign resources financed
nearly half of gross domestic investment. In 1977-79 the latter was 141 of
GDP, while foreign savings  amounted  to  2.71  of  GDP.   In 1980-81 gross
domestic investment was 13.81 of GDP, and foreign savings climbed to 7Z of
GDP. The end of the boom showed the decline in the availability of foreign
resources to finance investment, particularly private investment. There-
fore, private savings were insufficient to finance investment and to sus-
tain growth. In the meantime, serious veaknesses were developing in the
financial system with the liberalization of the operations of financial
intermediaries since 1979-80.

Economic Crisis and Transition. 1982-84
3.58     This period corresponds with the economic crisis that followed the
previous period and a year of economic transition toward a new adjustment
program (Table 3.5). In 1984 there were several setbacks in economic pol-
icy design and implementation. The 1982-83 crisis was one of Chile's worst
economic disasters. GDP declined to -14.11 in 1982 and -0.71 in 1983.
Unemployment climbed to a fourth of the labor force. A large part (nearly
half) of the productive sector was insolvent, and the same fate befell the
biggest commercial banks. Total external debt rose from US$17.2 billion in
1982 to US$19.7 billion in 1984.   In 1982-83 total investment was entirely
financed by domestic savings.      External savings turned negative because
foreign banks were reluctant  to  lend more.  Economic depression created
public deficits as  revenues  decreased.    Current  expenditures could not
contract accordingly because of the high level of existing unemployment and
the  Government's  social  security  obligations.    Consequently, domestic
credit to the public sector had to Increase. The 1982-83 devaluations in
the midst of the recession had devastating effects on the corporate sector,



- 83 -
sitch was highly  Indebted  in  foreign  currency.    Bankruptcies spread
throughout the country.   Imports  declined  and contributed to improve the
resource balance, but the current account deficit was around US$2 billion.
Inflation showed down in 1982 because of the impact of the crisis: in 1982
consumer prices rose nearly lOXI in 1983 they grew 272, and in 1984 202.

3.59     The economic crisis was  the  result  of  external shocks, such as
declining copper prices, and of the application of incorrect economic poli-
cies both at the time and in the previous period. Economic growth was
expected to  arise  spontaneously  from  the  earlier  liberalization.   in
December 1982, Chile developed a short-term stabilization program, sup-
ported by the IMF, that was intended to reduce current account deficits,
increase international reserves, and slow down inflation. Nevertheless,
outbreak of the financial crisis at the beginning of 1983 forced the Gov-
ernment to take control of the largest financial banks in distress. The
recovery was weak because of the financial crash. The major problems con-
fronting the economy were unemployment, lack of foreign exchange, and the
need to increase savings and investment.    Tariffs were doubled in 1983 in
order to raise fiscal revenues.   There were also pressures to use tariffs
for the protection of domestic producers; therefore an anti-export bias was
generated.
The SAP. 1985-88
3.60     The need for  structural  adjustment  developed  In the transition
period, and it finally began in. 1985 with the program agreed with the InM
and the World Bank. It was a new liberalization attempt that would take
account of past policy mistakes. Graduality was introduced, and monitoring
and supervision were reinforced, notably in the financial sector. The
fragile recovery initiated in 1984 was sustained in the following years.
Some of the effects of external shocks were gradually reversed. In 1985
the GDP growth rate was 2.42.   The following two years it surpassed 52 and
it was above 62  in  1988.   Unemployment declined considerably, to levels
similar to those during the liberalization  period.   If these rates of GDP



- 84 -
growth are compared with those prevailing In the recovery stage of the
liberalization period 1973-81, they  look  a  little  lower.  owever, they
reflect a more solid SAP.
3.61     The main feature of this program continues to be the articulation
between stabilisation and structural adjustment,  as can be seen In efforts
to re-establish an export-oriented economy, a genuie expansion In public
and private savings, and the strengthening of a rehabilltated fif.Lncial
sector (Table 3.6).

3.62     The inflation rate vas  notably  reduced  to  122 and the current
balance of payments deficit contracted to little more than 12 of GDP.
Official gross reserves increased by more than one third with respect to
1981. These results speak well for the stabilization efforts carried out
by the the Government with the IHP's financial support and provided a good
basis for the SAP supported by the Bank. the medium-term goals were also
successfully attained. Gross domestic investment represented 16.92 of GDP



- 65 -
in 1987-88, and the ratio of gross national savings to GDP rose from 5.42
in 1985 to 15.42 in 1988.    The  ratio  of external debt to GDP grew until
1985 and then began to decline, to 832 in 1988. Exports kept growing, at
rates similar to general economic (GDP) growth, and continued their trend.
Imports, however, accelerated according to- the economic expansion. The
terms of trade evolved favorably for Chile from 1986 onwards. The rise in
the price of copper played an Important role in surpassing the program
targets.
3.63     As far as  the  stabilization  program  was  concerned, when minor
slippages in policy lmplementation occurred, corrective measures were taken
quickly, and this permitted the program to continue vith little deviations
from the targets. The structural actions were evaluated more by the meas-
ures taken than by  the  actual  results.    In --his sense, the results of
structural reforms were mixed with those coming from the stabilization
program. That is why stabilization sad structural policies merge in a
general and consistent program that has been successful in the medium-term,
but that can still be extended to consolidate new long-run targets for
resource,allocation and to make economic policy less dependent on copper
exports.
D. Resional and Country Comparisons
3.64     This section offers  comparisons  of  Chile's economic performance
with that of other Latin American countries during the SAP period. The
comparisons, although suggestive, must be interpreted with caution because
of data limitations with respect to varying quality and methodological
derivation. Nevertheless, the recovery of the Chilean economy that took
place after the 1982-83 crisis was remarkable, particularly after 1985, in
large part because the implementation of the SAP's medium-term goals was
accomplished and the process of liberalization was reset on more solid
grounds. Chilean expansion of economic activity looks interesting in the
Latin American context, since there are several regional similarities in
international trade and external  debt.    In  these comparisons the period
chosen will be restricted to the 1980s.
3.65     In terms of  average  annual  rates,  Chile  grew  at 2.22 between
1981-88, when the Latin American average for the period (including Chile)
was 1.62 (Table 3.7). Chile's expansion was above the average. Most of
Latin American countries experienced recessions in 1982 and 1983. Only
Colombia, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic showed increases of GDP in both
years. The decline of GDP in 1982-83 was larger in Chile (14Z) than in the
region as a whole  (4X).    The  tremendous  impact of the Chilean economic
crisis brought down  the  average  rate  of  growth.    If one compares the
expansion that took place in 1984 and in following years, the deviation of
Chile from the rest rises considerably.    Chile  grew at an annual rate of
5.12, while the region as a whole experienced 2.9Z growth in 1983-88.

3.66     Within Latin American,  economic  performance  in 1983-88 differed
according to whether a country was an oil exporter. Chile is not. During
the period, annual GDP growth for the region as a whole (excluding Cuba)
was 2.91. For oil-exporting countries it was 1.31, and for non-oil-export-
ing countries it was 3.92 Chile'. annual GDP growth during the period was
5.1?. In general, oil exporters grew less because of the depressive impact
of the years 1982-83.    However,  if  1982  and 1983 are excluded, non-oil
exporters are still above, and oil exporters, below the average. The
latter experienced slower progress because of falling petroleum prices.
Chile's performance was  excellent  in  this  context. *       hen compared with
other countries in the region, it had the most rapid annual GDP growth
(5.11) during 1983-88, followed by Brazil (5), Colombia (4.61), and Costa
Rica (4.21). Product per capita (Table 3.8) also increased more in Chile
than in the rest of the region.    For 1981-88, it grew 0.31 yearly--a slow
rate, but one that was exceeded only by Barbados (0.61). Most Latin
American countries suffered importment declines in GDP per capita. The
average variation for the whole group was -11 a year.

3.67     Chile experienced a significant growth  in the purchasing power of
its exports of goods  in  1983-88s    10.7?  annually on the average (Table
3.9). For the region as a whole, it was 2.5; oil-exporting countries lost
(-4.12 per year), and non-oil exporters Increased (7.9? per year), purchas-
ing power of their exports. Although magnitudes differ, the pattern of the
comparison persists in the evolution of the terms of trade. The region saw
its aggregate terms of trade deteriorate at -2.1? a year. Oil exporters
suffered a more severe loss, at an annual rate of -7.8?. On the contrary,
non-oil exporters experienced an improvement of 2.1Z per year. Chile's
terms of trade rose 3.7? yearly between 1983 and 1988. This performance
was particularly affected by the recovery in the price of copper, which
took place in 1986 and which was significantly accentuated in following
years.  The improvement  in  Chile's  terms  of  trade exceeded the average
performance of the region and  other major  countrier within it.  This was
one of the basic factors explaining the quick recent growth of the Chilean
economy.

3.68     Another favorable  characteristic  of  Chile with  respect to the
region as a whole is that Chile's inflation was kept well below the average
(Table 3.10). This situation became more evident from 1985 on, when infla-
tion in Latin America  increased  significantly.    In Chile the adjustment
program with its stabilization component succeeded in reducing the rise in
local prices.  In fact, Chile  has  controlled  its inflttion at a level of
2QZ for quite some time.

3.69     Another item for comparison is the external debt (Table 3.11).  In
1983-88 Latin America added 2.62 yearly to its foreign obligations. Oil-
exporting countries experienced a slight annual rise in their external
debt, less than 1Z.    Non-oil  exporters, however, experienced increase in
their debt at the anual rate of  3.92.  Chile's debt Increased at 1.21 per
year. In 1988 Chile was able to reduce Its outstanding debt. There were
other countries that managed to cancel part of their external capital com-
mitments--such as Brazil and Sl Salvador within the non-oil-exporting
group, and Mexico and Bolivia within the oil exporters. Chile has also
rescheduled comitments already due. For instance, in 1984-8S, it resched-
uMd US$5.7 billion In 1986-87 and US$12.5 billion in 1987-88.  The Chilean
experience led to an Iprovement In its creditworthiness.

3.70     To sum up, the Chilean  experience  in the years of implementation
of its SAP has  been  outstanding.    In  the  comparisons with other Latin
American countries, however, not all the characteristics of the Chilean
evolution during the period considered have been favorable. For example,
Chile was one of the countries with a permanently high level of unemploy-
ment, sharing that distinction with Colombia, Jam_ica, and Panama (Table
3.12).  Even when the  SAP  started  in  1985, allowing Chile to reduce its
unemployment, figures were still  high.   The most significant improvements
In this regard have taken place since 1986, but CEPAL's figures use data
from different sources and methodologies that make cross-country compari-
sons and the reconciliation with official national estimates extremely
difficult. Data on employment and real wages show that in Chile a great
part of the burden of adjustment was borne by laborers. The feature of the
economic policies implemented was that, in order to sustain employment,
wages were allowed to decline in real terms. This trade-off did not occur
ex post, since wages remained low and unemployment was controlled at a high
level. The policy actions were directed toward the emergency employment
programs, or EEPs, which prevented the unemployment rate from soaring.
When the economic expansion gained force, the EEPs could be ended. Around
1988 the evolution of wages and salaries changed, and important real
increases took place.

E. Reality versus Programs
3.71     This section confronts the ex ante programs with the ex post real-
ity during the SAP period and also in the immediately preceding years. The
three periods show different experience. First, the liberalization program
was expected to bring the economy back to equilibrium both in production
and external accounts, based on deregulation and the search of more effi-
cient allocation of resources.   Some structural problems developed and the
boom of 1980-81 ended in the worst economic crisis in Chile in the past 50
years. Since then, economic policy looked for measures and programs to
stabilize and rehabilitate the seriously damaged economy and then to con-
solidate the achievements in the medium-term. It took the 1982-1983 crisis
and the 1984 transition to clear the way for an adjustment program that
could confront structural problems.   In the meantime, the policies carried
out in 1982-84 were mainly directed to price stabilization and balance of
payments corrections. At the beginning these results were not as close to
the programmed goals as expected, but the experience led the authorities,
first, to diagnose structural problems and, second, to devise a consistent
program.
3.72     The period of economic  crisis  and transition also showed greater
deviations between realization and programming. To illustrate this aspect,
main deviations between actual and programed variables can be averaged for
the complete period (Table 3.13).

The four targeted variables have been compared year by year with actual
values. The averages have been calculated for the period. In 1982-84 the
average deviations were negative for all individual targets. This means
that for variables programed values  exceeded  actual values.  In 1985-88,
the four variables chosen showed  a  different picture.  Actual values sur-
passed programmed values  for  economic  growth  and  inflation.   That is,
results were better than expected. The opposite happened for the current
account and fiscal deficits; both these variables showed overoptimistic
prograuming. However, the magnitudes of the deviations can be compared
with the same items in 1982-84; even when results were not as good as
expected, the average deviations in the more recent period were smaller
than earlier. The last two rows of Table 3.13 show that the average total
deviation (for the four targets) was positive in 1985-88. In other words,
although there were positive and negative deviations, the dominant value
was lower than zero, and this points to the idea that the bias was to
underestimate the evolution of the variables. Perhaps this funding is also
the result of a more consistent set of policy measures in a definite direc-
tion. Soae of these virtues derived from the SAP were absent in the eco-
nomic policy of 1982-84. The smaller variance in the SAP experience gives
the idea of greater uniformity.
3.73     These figures by themselves  are  insufficient to prove the point,
but they are helpful in synthesizing a set of conclusion derived from a
more detailed and deep evaluation of the program. The superiority of the
SAP's performance with respect to that of 1982-84 is obvious, but it is
also superior to that of the period of liberalization policy that preceded
stabilization policies in 1982-84. The new program has stressed graduality
and has taken much more care that certain supervisory roles of the public
institutions were strengthened. There are two characteristics that led to
the SAP's success and deserve mention.   The first was when the administra-
tion changed the implementation of economic policy after recognizing past
mistakes, and tried not to repeat earlier errors. This was important in
ensuring consistency in the new  program.   The second was that not every-
thing was wrong with the earlier liberalization program; moreover, that
many of its achievements induced long-run effects, (for example, the elas-
ticity of response of nontraditional exports and of import substitution).
The search for more efficient and less costly ways of production and the
like produced external economies that benefited the SAP when it started in



- 93 -
1985. This is important because it shows that both experiences--that of
1973-81 and of 1985-88--were closely linked.
3.74     Another reason  for  the  SAP's  overshooting  its  goals was that
strong positive external shocks helped the economy to grow faster and the
Government to get a better  grip  on  public finance.  This external effect
must not be underrated.   Nearly  402  of the cumulative GDP growth between
1984 and 1988 was attributable to better terms of trade (281) and lower
international interest rates (121).    When  the policies were designed the
future evolution of these variables was not foreseen exactly. That is why
results were much better than  expected.   The windfall from improved terms
of trade and more favorable interest rates explains almost totally the
unexpected success in GDP.
3.75     Although the IM  monitored  the  program  according to its tradi-
tional approach--with stress on a given number of economic variables-- the
Bank =o'tored a few additional variables but, in general, placed its em-
phasis on the implementation of structural measures rather than on their
results. This was so because in many cases the effect could not be direct-
ly associated with the policy instrument. It is clear both for the Govern-
ment and the two international financial institutions, that the program
requires careful attention to ensure sustainability, which at present im-
plies the need to consolidate the achievements in the long run. The long-
term goals necessarily include reinforcement of export diversification and
promotion of nontraditional exports to reach a significant share of total
exports. A second long-run objective should be to make fiscal revenues
more independent of the current account of the balance of payments.  Third,
efforts should be intensified to distribute the fruits of development to a
larger proportion of the population.    If benefits reach larger quantities
of people, there will be more public support for continuing the structural
adjustment efforts.
F. Final Remarks
3.76     The Chilean SAP,  with  its  significant  SAL  component, has been
successful in the sense that its application is associated with rapid
growth, diversification of exports, and strong reduction in unemployment to
less than 101 of the labor force, in a context of better resource alloca-
tion. In other words, the SAP has intended to improve efficiency in both
the private  and  public  sectors.    The  program  constitutes a different
approach to a free market economy that the previous one (begun in 1973),
which started with permissive liberalization of financial markets. The SAP
has been more gradual and prudently directed, toward an outward-oriented
economy with diversified exports.
3.77     The main virtue  of  the  program  since  1985 is its consistency.
Most of the measures correspond to a unified strategy and interact coher-
ently. The short-run policies, both fiscal and monetary, have been applied
in accordance with the SAP.    This feature becomes significant because the
proceeds of the SALs were used to finance imports (excluding those for
luxury and military consumption).  To  the  extent that the funds have not
been tied to particular projects, the risk of incompatible applications
arises. However, Chile's Goverument managed to maintain consistency in its



- 94 -
policy measures: they took into account both stabilizption and adjustment
requirements. There was a strong commitment of the administration to reha-
bilitate the economy in a context of liberalization, and the international
financing institutions concurred. Proof of that determination has been the
continuity in policy design and instrumentation since 1973. This created
sufficient credibility in the Government's aims and permitted the Bank to
disburse the three SALs with relatively few conditionalities.
3.78     The quick response of  the  economy  both  to the previous and the
present policies of liberalization has been accompanied lately by favorable
export performance and rates of interest abroad. When external pressures
on the balance of payments are released, the macroeconomic framework
becomes favorable to the implementation of stabilization policies. This
fact may obscure the degree of vulnerability that still persists in the
program. Future external shocks may not only alter the depth of the meas-
ures but also the articulation of the different policy instruments,
affecting the heretofore beneficial consistency of the program. The artic-
ulation of trade policy, public budgetary policy, and external debt manage-
meut i8 complex and crucial for medium-term success. Such articulation
will affect the allocation of resources for production and consumption.
3.79     The components of the SAP  are  not symmetric in this respect. The
financial policy looks more solid in the long run. Trade policy requires
attention in terms of long-term effects on the exporting and import-substi-
tuting sectors for future years, on the one hand, and in terms of budget
constraints, on the  other.    Conversely,  public sector management should
become more independent of primary exports and build a future structure of
revenues on structural grounds, and future export and import-substituting
activities  must  develop  in   correspondence with  the  reallocation  of
resources that is taking place in the economy.
3.80     Another point to bear in mind  is  survival of the program in the
medium-term in the face of conflicting pressures from different sectors.
Some measures carried out by the authorities particularly affect in the
social sectors.  The  long  consumption restraint required by stabilization
and adjustment policies should be given some pressure release provided that
economic performance allows  it.    The  internal opposition that different
sectors have toward  certain  measures  may  create  inconsistencies in the
programs.
3.81     Trade policies should specify  the. roles  of export subsidies and
import tariffs and their interaction in the process of resource allocation.
Public finances require a long-run program for revenues and expenditures to
make public investment compatible with noninflationary resources. Another
important issue is future. foreign  debt management.    The three areas of
economic policy are interlinked in the present case, and provisions must be
made to curb adverse effects derived from eventual external shocks. So
far, the SALs have been a good instrument to initiate the SAP--but it is
evident that adjustment cannot stop after disbursement of these three
loans. The objective of achieving a permanent modification in economic
structure requires sustained efforts in the same direction. Further insti-
tutional changes will have to be brought about, and that conception of
long-run policy may consolidate the process initiated by the SALs.

IV. ISSUES AND LESSONS
4.01     This chapter is divided Into  three sections.  The first discusses
subjects on which there are doubts or opposing views  the timing of the
World Bank's structural lending in Chile, the public cost of financial
rehabilitation, some social issues, and whether there are prospects for
sustainable adjustment. The second section draws lessons from the Chilean
SAP and its principal SAL components: export promotion, public savings and
investment administration, financial rehabilitation, and measures affecting
social and other  sectors.    The  final  section  derives from the Chilean
experience some notes on the Bank's structural lending activity; specifi-
cally, on preparation, conditionality, monitoring, phasing out, relations
with member country authorities, efficiency and costs, and evaluation of
SALS.
4.02     Many of the lessons seemingly add no  new knowledge or by now may
seem truisms. That old ideas tend to block new ones biases evaluations in
this direction; natural curiosity and the allure of potential new discov-
eries work in another. From the point of view of future Bank performance,
however, the evidence of a case, is equally important for proposing change
and for lending support to established operations.
A. Issues
4.03     The first question to  pose  about  the  Bank's active presence in
Chile is: Was it timely?    Answering  the question has prompted debate on
the basis of both Chile's and the Bank's circumstances and operations.
The Bank's Timing in Chile
4.04     In Chile the foreign exchange  crisis  detonated in June 1982.  It
came as an almost total surprise. With some lags it carried major business
groups and banks into insolvency, which was only partially realized at the
time, and the situation became unsustainable by early 1983. There was no
clear diagnosis, only confusion. Within about a year, there was succession
of four finance ministers. Economic statistics for 1982 indicate the mag-
nitude of the crisis. On the demand side, while exports recovered 10.9g,
consumption declined 13.52 and investment plummeted 65.42. On the supply
side, GDP fell 14.31, and imports contracted 32.91. Savings also went down
sharply, by 34.72. Although the current balance of payments deficit shrank
from US$4.6 billion to US$2.4 billion, international reserves still dropped
by US$1.3 billion because of the draining of direct private investment and
medium- and long-term loans and because of capital flight. The public
sector, which had posted overall fiscal surpluses in previous years, showed
in 1982 a deficit of 3.42 of GDP because of increased expenditure, caused
in large part by the transformation of the social security system.
4.05     In early 1983 a new finance minister, Caceres, took charge of the
economy. At that time, still in the opening months of the Latin American
debt crisis, the foreign debt situation was the most pressing issue. The



- 96 -
Minister went straight into a fast shadow' program, which became effective
on agreement with the IMF, and yielded to the creditor banks' demand that
the state guarantee the foreign debts of the private sector. It is worth
remembering that the IMP's practice was then to vait for agreement with the
creditors banks before making effective its own agreement. Figures for
1983 cover a large part of  Caceres's  tenure.   On the demand side exports
nearly  stagnated  (+1.4X),   consumption   declined  slowly  (-5.8X),  but
investment sharply (+15.39).   On  the  supply side, GDP remained depressed
(-0.81) while Imports experienced  another,  smaller drop (-9.4Z).  Savings
almost levelled off  (-1.7I) in  its  fall.    The  deficit in the current
account  of  the  balance   of   payments   was   cut  to  US$1.1  billion.
International reserves decreased by only US$541 million because, although
direct private investment and medium- and long-term loans diminished, other
capital movements became  slightly  positive.    The overall fiscal deficit
declined to 0.61 of GDP, mainly  because of expenditure restraint under the
unfavorable conditions. Whereas the external sector and investmentIsavings
performance improved and showed promise, the prolonged recession and the
social situation (20? open unemployment plus 152 of the population in
emergency employment programs or EEPs) weakened the political stability of
the  Government.    There were  disagreements  between  the  political and
economic authorities, and the President changed the finace minister in
March 1984.
4.06     The new finance minister,  Escobar Cerda, followed an expansionary
line and moved to assist insolvent firms and banks, but the 6.32 GDP growth
(with an explosion of investment) 1984 proved unsustainable because of
pressures on the balance of payments, the deteriorating fiscal situation,
and the acceleration  of  inflation.    Despite  closer  contacts with (and
missions by) the Bank, under the prevailing conditions an agreement with
the IMP was impossible, and this precluded any Bank SAL. The finance
minister tried to invoke protectionism, both for fiscal and terms of trade
reasons, but faced stern resistance.    He was finally replaced in February
1985 by BUchi, whose tenure lasted throughout the period of SALs 1-111.
4.07     The new finance minister had firm  political support.  By then the
need for a medium-term economic strategy was widely recognized. BUchi
addressed the economic agenda decisively and got early support from the IMP
and the Bank. The latter had renewed its knowledge and contacts with Chile
and moved swiftly, providing important services in the design and early
implementation of the SAP.
4.08     Thus, a more  precise  rephrasing  of  the  question  is:  Would a
Bank's SAL in 1983--by supporting Caceres' effort and reducing some of the
costs of his policies--have extended his program, and thus avoided the more
expensive adjustment later? Or would such a SAL have been insufficient to
sustain politically the program, making more difficult the Bank's later
reappearance on the scene?
4.09     During the 1970s and early  1980s  Chile showed little interest in
the Bank's assistance or in formulating structural reforms; it's foreign
funding came in the form of  commercial banks' loans to the private sector,



-97-
which then were abundantly available.    Until early 1983 the Chilean eco-
nomic team was so convinced that its own program was flawless, that it
could not be motivated to  enter  into  a meaningful policy discussion with
the Bank. The Bank submitted important memoranda to the authorities show-
ing that their present policies were untenable, but such presentations were
either ignored or rejected. The result was loss of contacts at Bank Head-
quarters, little Bank activLty in the country, an emptied loan pipeline,
and reduced staff time devoted to Chile by the Banks from 1981 to 1983
only one loan officerteconomist was in charge of monitoring economic
developments in the country. In any case, with four finance ministers in
little over a year, it would have been most difficult to enter into a SAL
in those years. Chile was not seen as creditworthy; nevertheless, while
the IMF was active, the Bank was passive--and this not by its own choice-
-with  regard  to  Chile  at  the  time.   AMother  aspect  of  the pollcy
environment then was the overall handling of the Latin American debt
crisis. The initial stage WaS "muddling through," led by the UV1 but with
the creditor  banks' agenda  at  the  forefront.    Although  SALs were in
existence and operating elsewhere, the IHF's standard coupling of financial
assistance with stabilization in debt-ridden countries was not really
launched until 1985. Finally, Chile's political climate did not make the
country a favorite within the Bank's Executive Board. Even as late as 1988
there was resistance to any lending to Chile on the part of some Board
members.
4.10     Nonetheless, the Bank assisted Chile  routinely and at low lending
levels in the early 19809s a US$32.4 million water supply loan in 1980, a
US$36 million agricultural credit, and a US$42 million highway reconstruc-
tion loan in 1981, another US$128 million highway loan, and a US$56 million
agricultural loan, and a US$80 million housing loan in 1983. In 1982 the
Bank also warned about, and made an early estimate of, the losses that
would ensue from the financial crisis and rehabilitation. The only time
when conditions may have been amenable for the Bank's adjustment lending to
Chile was in 1983, under  the  Caceres tenure, after the country's Stand-by
agreement with the IMF.   One  subject  blockilg the advance, besides those
mentioned, was the lack of knowledge  about the situation of the financial
sector. Another was the time required to start a SAL from scratch without
any international political support for the country's Government.
4.11     The turnaround in the Bank's attitude toward Chile occurred during
1984, and the Bank reinforced its staff charged with following the Chilean
economy. By mid-1984 collaboration with the IMP began. Although there was
no updated country report, the need for a medium-term joint effort was
accepted. The key element was the submission to, and the recognition by, a
World Bank Senior Vice-President of reasons supporting renewal of the
Bank's involvement in Chile.    Conditions  for  that involvement were met:
monetary and fiscal efforts supplemented by a drive to promote saving,
exports and other objectives.   That Senior Vice-President remembers that a
memorandum from the Bank Regional Vice-President brought up the subject,
and that the consistency of Chilean efforts over time, th.e principle of not
letting politics cloud technical judgments, and the prospect of intriguing
and innovative policy actions gained his personal commitment to the
proposal, which has generally been regarded as crucial. le authorized



- 98 -
bypassing some usual steps, such as the preparation of a country program
paper. The time for the SAL came when Btchi became finance minister and
took decisive action In early 1985, although the loan was not signed until
in October 1985.   There were  several  causes  for the delay--among them,
establishment of the CSF and negotiations with creditor banks--but from the
beginning it was agreed in the Bank to act *as if* the package was going
ahead. The Bank also moved forward in guaranteeing a syndicated B-loan in
co-financing, with full support from the US government (a few months later,
the Baker plan was launched) and under pressure from creditor banks.
4.12     Thus, a further refinement of  the  timing question iss  Would the
Bank have given Chile a SAL in 1983 if preparations at the technical level
had been ready? Or would it have waited until 1985 in any case, since the
international financlal climate and the political sensibilities were not
yet unfavorable? There il no consensus on an answer. There were technical
and operational aspects to surmount that made it difficult for the Bank to
come up wlth a SAL for  the  program.    Some  of  them might be due to the
diminished presence of the Bank in Chile in the previous years, some to the
lack of initiative on Chile's side.
4.13     Nevertheless, a majority--not all--of  observers feel that had the
Bank come forward with a SAL in 1983, the economic and the political envi-
ronments vere such that the SAL would not have had good chances of turning
the tide. The delay served to demonstrate the need for financial assis-
tance and the dangers of reversing the liberalization policies. Thus this
delay--despite its high social costs--may have been a necessary condition
for gathering solid support behind a new stabilization-plus-adjustment
effort.   By  the  same  token,  it  is not  clear  that the international
financial community or the Bank's Board were ready in 1983 to approach
renewed relations with Chile--with its political climate, its debt-ridden
economy, and the lack of a clear diagnosis of its economic situation-
-decisively and with a medium-term view.    That view started to evolve in
late 1983 but  gained  full  acceptance  only  during  1984.   Against this
background of doubtful counterfactual histories, there is the conclusive
evidence of the successful SAL operation begun in 1985, when the situation
was ripe for action and both Chile and the Bank seized the opportunity.
The Impact of the SAP on Public Finance
4.14     The most significant costs of  the  SAP to the public sector, came
from State intervention to avoid generalized bankruptcies of banks and
enterprises during the crisis of 1982-83. Intervention included transform-
ing private into public foreign debts, privatizing state enterprises (not
related to the Bank's SALs), and converting foreign debt into domestic
debts or claims on domestic assets (equity), which produced benefits whose
magnitude is contested.   The whole  question has important distributional
implications.
4.15     Since the  problem  originated  long  before  the  1985 SAP, (with
effects that continued through it and will continue to be felt in the
future), it is necessary to trace its origins and significance. The same



_ 99 _
is necessary for some of the mechanisms used to solve the problem. There
is no quantitative basis to support an appraisal of these questions--only
sparse data exist, thus far  impossible  to  consolidate.   The aim at this
point is to illustrate the magnitudes involved and to bring out some of the
implications. This is a far cry from drawing lessons from the Bank's SAL
experience, which covered only the years 1985-88 and did not have a bearing
on all aspects of the problem.
Evolution of Public Sector Finance
4.16      From the beginning the SAP had to cope with the burden left by the
1981-83 economic and financial crisis.   The efforts at financial rehabili-
tation, reprivatization, and management of external debt had generated
heavy losses to the public sector, that had to be distributed over a long
period, implying strong constraints on the budget. This burden of losses
underlay the evolution of operational and quasifiscal deficits and the
grovth of public external indebtedness (Table 4.1).

4.17     The public sector deteriorated after  1981. and the deficit became
important in  1982.    Capital  accounts  looked more  stable than current
accounts, but the intervention to rehabilitate corporate and financial
institutions produced changes in the capital accounts. The same happened
with the process of reprivatisation.   After 1981 current revenues showed a
declining trend produced by a reduction in direct taz collection, a short-
run fall in external trade taxes, and a sharp reduction in revenues derived
from the pension system. The evolution of public sector finances was con-
nected with efforts to stabilize the financial market and the privatized
public enterprises. The former operations implied lmportant commitments of
funds by the Government and implicit or explicit subsidies to the private
sector. On the one hand these created a rapid and spontaneous response
from economic agents--thus, also growth and revenues--and on the other they
added new constraints to the public budget in the future, through lower net
revenues from enterprises.
Financial Rehabilitation
CiS8    Another aspect of public cost  of the economic policy is connected
with the burden of quasi-fiscal operations of the Central Bank. There are
some actions performed by the monetary authority that are fiscal rather
than monetary.  In fact, all  actions Involving transfers of resources from
the Central Bank to other economic agents, such as various subsidies, are
quasi-fiscal operations.
4.19     The efforts to rehabilitate  financial institutions started before
the SAP was designed. The outbreak of the financial crisis in 1981, fol-
lowed by the 1982-83 economic crisis, required rapid intervention by the
Government to prevent a generalized collapse of enterprises and financial
institutions. The costs of rescue operations exerted a growing pressure on
the public sector in those years.   By 1987 the rescue operations were com-
pleted. The SAP played a significant role in this completion by limLting
the quasi-fiscal costs of subsidies given to the private sector--not only
to reduce the fiscal deficit but also to improve the incentive mechanisms
by increasing competition. The Central Bank supported the private sector
by purchasing nonperforming portfolios from the weakened banks; reschedul-
ing domestic debt from productive sectors, and real State-warranted loans;
making subsidies through interest rate differentials and preferential
exchange rates. The purchase of nonperforming portfolios from the private
financial sector was equivalent to 281 of the Central Bank's total place-
ments of funds and to 182 of GDP in 1985. The SAP started with a strong
determination to end these subsidies.
4.20     It is not e%sy to have  precise data on the impact of quasi-fiscal
operations and the losses in public finance derived from the process of
rehabilitation.   Available  information  is  insufficient  to evaluate the
costs. Some studies, however, have elaborated on current data and have
provided some  estimates  from  different angles, which  at  least give a
picture of the public costs of the rehabilitation process. Table 4.2 shows
an estimation of the amount of subsidies incurred by the Central lank to
support the private sector.  Alternatively, there are also figures showing
the amount of financial sector losses.

4.21     From the comparison of public outflows in subsidies granted to the
private sector and losses of the financial public sector in Table 4.2, it
follows that subsidies were nearly three-fourths of financial public sector
losses in 1982-85. Later on, the still remaining quasi-fiscal subsidies
equaled total losses. The average annual losses in 1986-87 declined In 74Z
with respect to 1982-85.   The  estimates  have  been elaborated under the
limitation that subsidized credits to the private sector underestimate real
subsidies, since credits do not include punishment for risky operations and
capital losses derived from changes in the repurchasing price of the pro-
missory notes through which these credits were given.
4.22     Table 4.3 shows that the  largest  subsidies to the private sector
took place before 1985s nearly 852 of total subsidies in 1982-87 took place
in the  pre-SAP  period.    Similarly,  financial  public  sector losses in
1982- 85 represented 89Z of the US$6,257 million registered in 1982-87.
Implicit arnual subsidies in the acquisition of portfolios were estimated
as 22 of the total amount purchased outstanding. The breakdown of subsi-
dies shows that most of the amount was in the form of preferential dollars
given to debtors in foreign currency. The subsidies on rescheduling opera-
tions were approximtely 52 of the amount involved. Since 1983 the domes-
tic public debt (Table 4.4) was expanded by Treasury funds given to the



- 102
Central Bank to finance deficits, in the amount of about US$6 billion.
This figure can be considered as the total amount of losses derived from
the operations  previously  mentioned.    Those  funds were  registered as
extraordinary revenues by the Central Bank and permitted coverage of the
losses. The losses incurred by the State must be reflected in its net
worth, whereas the lack of liquid funds can be met by increase in domestic
public debt. Assume that the State buys portfolios for 100 and pays for
them with cash. The public sector balance sheet then showss

The changes in external debt show that public debt increased more than
private debt, reflecting transformation of the second into the first, by
the widening of public guarantees on existing and new operations. The 1985
SAP succeeded in limiting quasi-fiscal costs and the burden of about US$6
billion on public finance derived mainly from previous operations. The
burden was an inescapable consequence of the economic and financial crisis
of 1982-83. Whether it could have been lighter is another, open question.
But at least the SALs supported a move away from these subsidies and inter-
ventions.
Poreian Private Debt Transfers and Guarantees
4.23     The public cost of  debt management has  been substantial in the
substitution of public or publicly guaranteed debt for nonguaranteed pri-
vate external liabilities.   This  process  began  after 1982 and was rein-
forced by the fact that the State remained the accepted borrower from
creditors abroad, and these creditors required further public guarantees on
their existing credits. The state takeover of private liabilities implied
an important transfer of resources to the private sector, in the form of
preforential exchange rates (preferential dollars) or direct assumption of
responsibility whenever private debtors could not pay. Data om the public
costs of these operations are not available here, but the evolution of
public and private debt gives a rough idea of the size of transfers of
private debt to the Government that had to be refinanced along with the
total external debt. In 1985 the latter amounted to 1.26 times annual GDP,
the financial services represented nearly .10 of GDP, and net transfers to
coammercial creditor banks amounted to 51 of GDP (Table 4.5).

In that year it represented a 58Z of the total, and in 1988 the proportion
had grown to 842. Conversely, private debt not guaranteed by the State
evolved from 422 to 162 in those years. Before 1983 the guaranteed private

4.25     Between 1983 and 1986  the private  unguaranteed debt declined by
US$6,868 million vhile guaranteed private debt increased by US$3,346
million. Public debt grew by US$7,044 million, vhereas the total external
debt increased US$3,522 million.   It  is  clear  that net private debt de-
clined US$3,522 million as well. Therefore, half of the increase in public
debt was to replace private debt. On the average, this replacement vent on
at a rate of US$880 million a year during 1983-86, nearly a SZ of annual
GDP. The proportion of publicly guaranteed private debt in total debt
undet State responsibility was 1S on the average in the period 1975-82. In
the four years between 1983 and 1986, that proportion rose to 17.32. In
1987 and 1988 the trend was altered by conversions of debt into equity and
by a larger reimbursement of public external debt. Financial rehabilita-
tion permitted firm and banks to comply with their foreign obligations,
thus relieving the State of its contingent liabilities. The Government
benefited from part of the discount obtained in debt-equity swaps.
Debt Conversion
4.26     In the course of application  of the SAP the authorities attempted
to accelerate the reduction of external debt by means of its conversion
into claims  on  domestic  assets  (Table  4.7).    Foreign  investors were
attracted to purchase Chilean dollar notes in the secondary markets and
convert them into claims on domestic assets at a discount, and this pro-
duced, particularly in 1988, Important reductions of the outstanding debt.
Given the existing discount on Chilean debt notes In International capital
markets, the  debt-equity  swaps and  other  operations  meant an implicit
profit to foreign investors in terms of an exchange rate of up to 442 in
1987. This Incentive privileged debt-equity swaps over investments of
fresh money.

4.27     In the  SAP  years  the  total  of  Ch4lean  dollar  notes swapped
amounted to one-third of the total outstanding external debt. Conversion
In that period was US$6.2 billion.   However, the external debt was reduced
by US$1.1 billion because of a rapid increase in credit from the IDB, the
IHY and the World  Bank,  among  others.    The capitalized debt made under
Chapter XIX of the compendium of rules for international exchange In Chile
and Decree Law 600 on foreign investment amounted to US$2.1 billion in the
period considered.
4.28     The figures in Table 4.8 reflect that, over the course of the SAP,
the discount was growing and on average represented 359 of the face value
of swaps corresponding to Chapter  XIX  operations.   Chilean debtors got a
12? discount. That Chilean debtors captured ouly a part of the discount in
the secondary markets its reasonable, since creditors were not payed cash
in dollar8 but instead got damestic Chilean paper. This can be measured as
a benefit of converting old into new debt.

4.29     The inducement for foreign investors  to buy debt notes at between
552 and 702 of face value in international markets and obtain in Chile 882
of that face value generated a preference for investment financed by debt
notes, and debt-financed investment in part substituted for other forms of
direct investment. The substitution of interest payments for profit remit-
tances released pressure on the balance of payments in the short run, since
dividends could be remitted abroad after the fourth year of the operation
and capital revaluations could be performed only after the tenth year.
4.30     Part of debt-equity conversions  were associated with the privati-
zation of public enterprises or firms under the transitory intervention of
the Government after the  1982-83  economic  crisis.   Besides, part of the
debt conversions were performed with Chilean dollar notes that originated
in the refinancing of private debts transferred to the Government. But it
would be improper to deduct the gains from debt conversions from the losses
in reprivatizating firms or from the losses in guaranteeing foreign private
debts. Those gains are benefits from a different, new operation and are
not assignable by origin or destination.

4.31     An open issue is whether Chile extracted all the benefits it could
have from debt conversion schemes--for instance, If public bids would have
been used In all cases. At the same time, it can be argued that, Insofar
as the only criteria to decide between offers is the discount offered, the
effect on investment tends to diminish (Dagnino Pastore, 1988).
Privatization of Public Enterprises
4.32     This program, an important part of the SAP, was neither negotiated
with the lank nor a part of  the  Bank's  SALs In Chile. It is, however, an
important issue for public sector finance. It is difficult to evaluate the
public cost of subsidies granted in the program of reprivatization during
1985-88. But there is at least one estimate of the transfers from the
public to private sectors (Marcel, 1989).
4.33     The process of privatization evolved through four different stages
after 1973. The first period covers 1974-75, when 241 public enterprises
intervened by the Allende Government were returned to the private sector.
In 1975-79 the process entered a new stage in which 110 firms with State
majority ownership were  privatized.    The  amount  privatized was US$664
million. The third period covers 1985-86 and involved the privatization of
previously intervened firms  as  a  consequence  of  the economic crisis of
1982-83. These enterprises were transferred to the private sector through
'popular capitalism.' The fourth round started in 1986 and is concerned
with the reprivatization of assets owned by or transferred through CORPO,
the Chilean Development Corporation (Table 4.9). The revenue expected from
the program was officially estimated at US$1,500 million (Table 4.10).

4.34i    The process  of  privatization  for  the  public  sector meant the
availability of proceeds of the sale of assets but the future loss of divi-
dends generated by those  enterprises..   The  estimations of the Impact of
privatization of public firms on the medium-term fiscal cash flow were made
on the assumption that future profitability and reinvestment of profits
would be similar. had  the  firms  remained  public.    On  the basis of the
expected behavior of firms  and  the  privatization program, three alterna-
tives of future fiscal cash flow were computed. Each alternative was based
on different assumptions about the cycle of reinvestment of profits and
distribution of dividends.
4.35     Between 1986 and 1989, assets were  sold to the private sector in
an amount of US$1,100 million. The cash impact (Table 4.11) was positive
until 1989.i Later on, the  loss  of  dividends would create a reduction' of
about US$360 million with respect to the previous year. Thus, the public
sector would lose annual revenues in the form of dividends in an amount



-110-
varying between US$100 million and US$165 million t(1987 dollars) between
1990 and 1997. Therefore, the positive flow of the first two years follow-
ing the asset sales would be exceeded by the dividend stream foregone. It
was also estimated that the loss of future dividends plus the deficit aris-
ing from the pension system reform of 1980 and tax reductions implemented
beginning 1984 would create a reinforced negative impact on the public
budget of more than US$1,000 million in the first years, reaching US$2,500
million in 1991. This represents over a 10Z of GDP if GDP were to keep
expanding annually at a steady SZ.

4.36     To evaluate the subsidies given  in  the purchase of public assets
(Table 4.12), the economic value of public enterprises was calculated as
their present value given Marcel's own prediction of future profits.
However, this approach--which relies on subjective judgments--may tend to
overestimate the fiscal losses, by assuming that the firms would have been
just as profitable had they remained part of the public sector, as they
were after  divestiture.    The  firms  being privatized  included  in the
estimatiot represented 802 of the total assets involved in the program and
the totality of sales in 1986-87.

NOTEs The present value of the firms was compared with the actual price at

based on book or stock market values.
4.37     The estimates in Table 4.12 show  that in 1986 and 1987 the subsi-
dies in the sales of shares were 502 and 352 of the privatized values in
the respective years. If rescue of CAP shares in 1986 and capitalization
of debts of ENDESA are taken into account, the total transfers to the pri-
vate sector as a percentage of traded values was 582 in 1986 and 552 in
1987. In 1986-87 the total transfer amounted to US$600 million. Reduction
In the subsidy margins showed improvements in the implementation of priva-
tization. If the rate of subsidy prevailing in 1987 were assumed to remain
in 1988, the state would have experienced a fiscal loss of US$350 million.
The cost of privatization is relatively higher whenever the functioning of
public enterprises was efficient and not led by politicized elites. In
that case, the motivations for widening privatization were mainly ideologi-
cal. In general, companies after privatization distributed most of their
profits in order to attract new stock purchasers (Table 4.13). Investment
was mainly covered by borrowing.

4.38     From a macroeconomic point of view,  the privatisation of public
enterprises is a simple transfer of physical assets from the State to the
private sector. Prom the angle of the public budget, the sale of assets
produces the availability of funds at the moment of collection, which
Increases the cash balance of the public sector.41 This effect will be com-
pensated in the future by the profits stream forgone by the State. Pro-
vided that the  enterprise  sold was originally efficient, public finance
will experience a negative impact in the course of time. This is a vay to
consider the public cost of the transfer of assets. Those costs affect
only the public budget.   In  general,  profits  lost by the State will be
earned by the private agents.   These costs correspond to the privatization
of efficient firms that made profits when they were owned by the public
sector.
4.39     In addition, the  public  sector  incurs  the  cost  of subsidies
granted to the private sector -that sometimes were directed to induce pur_
chase of assets. However, there is no proof that in the absence of subsi-
dies the privatization schem   would not work, or vice versa.  Subsidies
derived from low sales prices and covered between one-third and one-half of
privatized values. The assets sold into private hands between 1986 and
1989 are estimated at US$1.1  billion.    So  subsidies varied from US$330
mllion to US$550 million.   The  incidence  on  the annual budget was very
important. Nevertheless, the public cost of the privatization should be,
like the success of the program, considered in the medium and long term.
The final outcome of these operations can only be checked against the
41 Revenues derived from privatizations should be accounted for under the
line, as part of the finance of the public sector. A reduction in
assets is analogous to an increase in liabilities.

actual evolution of the privatized enterprises in the future, taking
account of profitability, the operational performance of the enterprises,
and the conditions of the products they supply to the market. This will be
the most important element in evaluating the costs--that is, the social
costs--for the Chilean economy of privatization of public enterprises.
4.40     Therefore, the outcome of  the  program  should be analyzed in the
context of resource allocation.   If more competitive behavior is achieved,
the means to economic efficiency will be justified; so, initial costs will
be matched by important benefits later.   Conversely, if competition is not
improved and efficiency results are not spread through the market mechanism
or imperfections remain or increase the costs to the economy, the success
of the program will be threatened. The idea of the State's role as subsid-
iary goes together with the expectation that privatization will improve
resource allocation. It is still very early to pronounce a verdict. So
far, it is true the privatization efforts have imposed new constraints on
the public budget. In the short and medium term, privatization may reduce
the availability of resources in the public sector, but these effects by
themselves do not impose strong conditions on public expenditure in the
future.
Some Social Issues
4.41     The evolution of the social  situation  over the course of the SAP
is one of the most hotly debated aspects of the administration's policy.
It is impossible to understand it without looking into the whole period of
the previous Government. It must be noted, however, that the SAP covered
only the last four years of that Government, when some programs and the
situation changed. The lessons drawn from these four years are stated in
Section B, below.   The  Government's  policies  in the social sectors were
mainly restricted by austerity in public expenditure. The Government's
observation of the rules of economic stabilization and structural adjust-
ment imposed a severe burden on wage earners, particularly on the lower-
income segments of the population.   Whereas other Government measures were
instituted to alleviate extreme poverty, it appears that the lower middle-
income groups felt more fully the impact of adjustment.
4.42     A study (Rodriguez Grossi,  1985)  concluded  that in Chile 402 of
the higher-income households captured over 50? of social subsidies. Many
of the State activities were directed toward social security, which repre-
sented over 40X of social expenditure and generated transfers accruing to
higher-income groups. The study argued that many programs did not have
redistributive criteria and were not particularly progressive. While the
author noted that the magnitude of social expenditure--about 201 of GDP-
-was considerable, it was not directed progressively to the more needy
sectors of the population. There were also serious problems of demand and
supply with respect to health, education, housing and basic services, which
made more difficult  the  access  from  the  poor  strata.   In housing, he
further noted that the programs requiring savings from the beneficiaries
were not directed at the poorest.   An important number of workers were not
affiliated to a social security system--nearly 502 of the labor force.
Moreover, he found that the hospital infrastructure rendered better
attention to urban than to rural sectors.

4.43     Another study. made in 1987  and published a year later (Arellano,
1988), found that the average standard of living iA Chile--as in many other
countries--had deteriorated between  1981  and  1987.    GDP per capita had
fallen (Table 4.14).

4.44     The Impact of adjustment  on unemployment was strong, particularly
after the economic crisis of 1982-83.   In the course of the period 1984-87
the unemployment rate, including persons employed in EPs, fluctuated at
around 16Z of the labor force. The economic recovery brought a significant
reduction in the amount of open unemployment. This was gradually compen-
sated by a reduction In the emergency programs. The Government considered
it a successful move toward absorbing unemployed and underemployed factors
into productive activity. However, critics of the program contended that
the increase in employment took place predominantly in activities of low
productivity and with Incomes much  lower  than those during the preceding

five years. Wages declined on average more than GDP per capita. The sub-
sidies given to workers involved in EEPs were also affected. The question
li whether there was a sustainable alternative to the absorption of labor
at lower wages. As far as pensions were concerned, until 1984 they showed
important increases in real terms. In 1985-86 they diminished nearly a 102
because of the temporary suspension of the adjustment for inflation. How-
ever, in the period 1982-86, pension receivers were the group least
affected by income declines.

4.46     The evolution of public  expenditure  directed  to fulfill social
policies is a matter of  controversy.   Cabezas (1988) explains the distor-
tions introduced by considering fiscal expenditure as an indicator of total
social expenditure. The former does not include flows financed with funds
of decentralized public entities, and there are problem in the accounting
of financial flows between central and decentralised sectors. In fact, he
argues, fiscal social expenditures represented only about balf of public
social expenditure.



- 117 _
4.47     According to recent  government  information on social expenditure
(net of social security contributions) In Chile in 1980-87, some conclu-
sions can be obtained regarding the composition and destination of subsi-
dies. Direct social expenditure consists mainly of subsidies granted by
the Government, sometimes in monetary form, to education, health, housing,
etc. Total direct social expenditure as a proportion of GDP was 8.8? in
1985; 7.671 in 1986, and 6.552 In  1987.    In this last year the ratio was
slightly below that corresponding to 1980.   In the three years of the SAP,
on the average 462 of direct social expenditure corresponded to subsidies
to education, 30X was in monetary subsidies (employment programs, dismiss-
als, assistance pension, maternal subsidies, etc. (132 was directed to
health, 9? to housing subsidies, and the remaining 2? covered other subsi-
dies. The rest of outlays, called *other social expenditure, corresponded
to General Pensions, Employment Programs (inputs for those programs and
intensive employment projects), and other social programs. Other social
expenditure amounted to 6.352 of GDP in 1985, 6.741 in 1986, and 6.6? in
1987. Both broad categories (direct and *other') carry the total fiscal
expenditure to 15.15? of GDP In 1985, 14.41? in 1986, and 13.05? in 1987.
4.48     The destination of direct social expenditure was mainly the lower-
income deciles of the population.   This was not uniform, however, and some
types of subsidies benefited middle-income groups. Generally speaking, 502
of the poorest population received 64? of subsidies granted in 1987. The
most progressive subsidies were those for health, (72X) and monetary subsi-
dies (71?), which were distributed in the give lower deciles. A different
picture was evident for housing, where 5O0 of the poorer population got
only 59? of the subsidies for that end; in education they received 57Z of
the funds granted.
4.49     The main conclusion is that, though aggregate fiscal social spend-
ing in 1988 was higher in absolute amount than that of 1970, overall fiscal
social spending has been concentrated heavily over the 19809 in two major
areas, social security and  *social welfare.'   Social security outlays in
1988 were fourfold higher in real (1988 dollar) term than that of 1970
(i.e., US$1,902 million versus US$512.6 million), while their relative
share of total fiscal social spending had almost doubled, i.e., 49.1 per-
cent compared to 26.9 percent.    The large increase in fiscal expenditures
on social security is the product of extensive reforms to the system which
include not only expansion of coverage to heretofore ineligible workers
but, most importantly, modification of its financing mode from pay-as-you-
go to individualized,  vested  accounts.    The  principal objective of the
latter reform was to strengthen the longer-term capacity of the system to
meet the pension requirements of a rapidly aging population. Its most
immediate effect, however, has been to strain significantly the public
budget.   Moreover,  though  government  outlays  for  social  security are
expected to diminish consistently year-to-year, until all obligations to
the beneficiaries covered ur' er the previous pension system are met, the
medium-term transition costi of the social security reforms will continue
to be substantial.    Further,  any  decision  to  increase social security



- 118 _
benefits prior to the Government's fulfilling all its obligations under the
old pension system obviously would increase the fiscal cost commensurately.51
4.50     In general, social  expenditure  has  indeed been directed to the
more needy sectors of the  population.   For example, special programs were
launched to alleviate the effects of unemployment (SEP subsidies--see Table
4.17). Whereas the impact of this type of expenditure was to alleviate the
hardships of some groups in extreme poverty, the next group up the income
ladder was made worse off.

4.51     In 1981 the functioning  of  the ISAPREs (Institutes of Preventive
Health) was established by  law.    Individuals  were allowed to choose the
institutions that would administer their contributions. Two options were
left to salaried workers, for payment of their 71 mandatory payroll
deductions to join either an ISAPRE or FONASA (the National Health Fund).
5I These are the findings of a forthcoming major Bank sector review of the
social  sectors  in Chile,   Social   Development  Progress  in Chile:
Achievements and ChallenRes, Report No. 8550-CH, forthcoming (para.

ISAPREs are primarily financial intermediaries acting between the user and
the supplier of the service. At present, ISAPREs are highly selective, and
the size of ISAPREs was nearly 112 of the total health system in mid-1988
(Aninat, Mendez y Asociados, 1989).    The  amount of the mandatory payroll
deduction has increased from 4Z of salaries in 1981 to 62 in 1983 and to 7X
commencing in 1985. The ISAPREs do not constitute a safety net. Notable
holes are the limited coverage for chronic diseases, and the plight of
those who lose their jobs and must stop their contributions.
4.52     Fiscal health spending in 1988 was  markedly below that of 1970 in
real absolute amount, as a share of GDP and in per capita.terms. At the
peak of fiscal health spending in 1973, outlays were US$554 million equiva-
lent (in 1988 dollars), or 22Z of Central Government social expenditures.
By 1981 the health sector's share in fiscal social spending had declined to
one-half (112), and by 1988 to just one-third (72) its 1973 level, albeit
in actual amount public health outlays increased slightly in 1988 dollars
between 1987 and 1988  (Table  4.18).    Moreover, per capita fiscal health
expenditures declined from US$56 in 1973 to US$21 in 1988 (both in 1988
dollars). Total fiscal health expenditures in 1987 of C$93.1 billion (in
1988 pesos) represented just 1.8 percent of GDP--a level far below that of
other countries at a similar level of economic development.6/ Further,
according to Ministry of Finance reporting to the International Monetary
Fund, more than 90Z of fiscal health recurrent budget allocations over the
past decade have been to hospitals despite emphasis on primary care. More-
over, the health investment budget has been negligible over much of the
1980s, contributing to deterioration of plant and equipment, particularly
in the hospital sector.7/

America Regional Indicators, 1989.

Has Chile Really Succeeded?
4.53     The  Bank's  structural  adjustment  lending  covered  four  years
1985-88;  the  first   year  was   devoted   to  discussion  and  advanced
implementation). Since then, the foreign finance component of the SALs has
been replaced by disbursements of World Bank loans totaling US$230 million
in 1989 and by similar amounts into the 1990., and by new sources, such as
the Bank of Japan.   The  question  is whether the three-year financial and
policy package of 1985 pulled together by Chile, the DMF, and the Bank has
effectively placed the country on the path of sustained growth while
keeping unemployment at acceptable rates and managing to service the
foreign debt.
4.54     Progress since the crisis  has been  eloquent.   GDP rose 7.4Z in
1988--the third consecutive year above 5.5Z--and in per capita terms has
reached the peak level of 1981.    Open urban unemployment was reduced from
202 in 1982 to 11.2Z In 1988 (excluding people in the Government's EEPs).
Although consumption is still 16.3Z below its 1982 peak, investment recov-
ered significantly, from 9.82 of GDP (probably less than the depreciation
of the capital stock) to 16.82 in 1988, supported by an explosive surge in
domestic savings, from 9.42 of GDP In 1982 to 242 now. Inflation was
brought down from over 202 during several years to 122 in 1988 (a threat of
the revival of high inflation is being handled currently). The trade bal-
ance moved from a deficit of US$2.7 billion In 1981 to a surplus of US$2.2
billion in 1988, with growth in noncopper exports outperforming growth in



- 121 -
copper exports every year, even after the sharp recovery of the copper
price In 1987. The terms of trade  are  5  off their decade peak of 100 in
1980 (the trough was at 76  in  1986).   The current account deficit of the
balance of payments was  still  US$200  million  in  1988, down from US$4.7
billion In 1981 and US$2.1  billion  in  1984.   The external debt declined
from a maximm of US$20.7  billion  in  1986  to  US$19.0 billion in 1988.

The worst fiscal year was 1982, with a current deficit of 4.4Z of GDP; in
1988 it was a 7.61 surplus, mostly because of a decline In expenditures
from 30.71 to 24.51 of GDP.   The  overall  deficit of 4.41 of GDP became a
0.52 surplus. The Central Bank deficit has also lost significance lately.
Thus, at a first glance a picture of the Chilean economy today suggests
that It is well on the path to self-sustained growth--although in the long
run not as fast as at present--and able to remain in compliance with its
foreign obligations, although this will be difficult.
4.55     A closer look at figures and likely trends, however, tends to con-
dition such definite statements and to raise a few doubts. The qualifica-
tions stem from the facts that a significant part (412) of GDP expansion In
the past two years is attributable to the windfall from improved interna-
tional copper prices, that the excess of domestic savings over Investment
is still not enough to cover fully interest payments on the foreign debt
(particularly in the public sector) and, thus, that additional foreign
finance and renegotiations will be needed, as well as continued efforts to
mobilize domestic savings.   Other  questions  come from envisioning future
trends and developments. The Chilean economy remains vulnerable to nega-
tive external shocks--a recession in industrial countries, swings in copper
prices, higher international interest rates--and to the accumulation of
pressures in the political, social and economic fields. There are uncer-
tainties surrounding the political transition and its effects on economic
policies (for example, the new administration's policy toward labor unions)
and public expectations (for example, the level of investment). There are
social needs in health and education whose satisfaction has been long
delayed. Finally, there are lnvestments In economic infrastructure and
production--which will increase both because of past delays and because the
economy is moving from recovery to previous peaks and into expansion
beyond--that will require additional productive capacity. In particular,
and despite a very good performance in the management of Its foreign debt,
Chile still has one of the largest per capita debts (US$1,638), and recent
projections show external gaps of 82 (US$380 million) in 1990, 1,578



- 122 -
(US$1,963 million) In 1991, and 1,181 (US$1,652 million) in 1992,81 after
considering (so far) net Bank disbursements of US$159,91 US$80 million, and
US$35 million, respectively. While the challenge to fill the gaps is less,
both in size and in difficulty, than that during the early SAP years, the
outcome still depends on continuous good economic performance--in turn
affected by external events.   Besides,  part  of the stabilization and ad-
justment effort was financed by postponement of public investment and
social outlays. While there are no exactly defined time limits to these
delays, several estimates place the necessary transfers of resources to
those ends in the order of 52 of GDP and 'coming due' in the near 19909.
Against this assessment of the current situation, as it resulted from a
medium-term evolution, the first  question  ist   What are the foreseeable
future changes -- external and internal--that will significantly affect
Chile's economic development?
The External Front
4.56     At a more specific level  than  the  future  rate of growth of the
world economy and the prospective behavior of international interest rates,
the price of copper has passed its peak and many experts predict another
decline, maybe to historical  levels.    This  would mean  a  loss of the
windfall terms of trade improvement that catapulted Chile's CDP growth from
the 5.52 per year that was programed to the rate of over 72 experienced in
1988--still a fast, but normal growth, with less slack in the external and
fiscal sectors. Tnitially, the fiscal impact of lower copper prices would
be cushioned by resorting to the Bank-supported CSF, which has accumulated
US$800 million (after deducting withdrawals for debt buybacks). This
course of events would not allow for further buybacks from this source of
funds. in any case, the boom is finishing for the leading fruit exports,
although it still goes on  for  some  specialties and new products (such as
salmon and berries, which are becoming hot export prospects). As an oil
importer, Chile is sensitive  to  International  fuel prices, but there has
been an expansion in Chile's productive capacity in copper and gold, as
well as in forestry, roads, and efficient import-substituting activities-
-an outcome of the SALs export policies.  To the earlier co ments about the
need to refinance the foreign debt when amortizations begin in 1991, it
must be added that some limitations on dividend remittances will be over at
roughly the same time.
4.57     Several Chilean observers point out that the country's good behav-
ior in servicing the foreign debt will be penalized by its exclusion from
the Brady plan. Excluded or not, some spillovers from the plan--if imple-
mented--will favor Chile's debt renegotiations.   Although the net flow of
funds with the IMP is already negative for the country, the World Bank will
be sustaining a positive net flow at a lower but still significant level in
1990, and there are already some signs of increasing commercial and project
lending and new foreign investment.
81 The figures reflects high (low) copper price hypotheses.

- 123 _
The Internal Front
4.58     The dominant issue is the  impact  of the recent change of Govern-
ment on economic policy and public  expectations.  The relevant question is
how economic policy would change.   Opinions are divided on this point, but
the mainstream view  is  that  the  practical  continuity of liberalization
policies since the 19708 and their success in more recent years (faster
growth, much lower unemployment, lower inflation) have given them wide-
spread support and created an anti-inflationary conscience. The reasons
are:
*    Positive perception  of  the  policies  by  the population,
despite some shortcomings (notably, in the social sector);
*    Job generation through  increased  export activities, which
gives the export-promoting policies political strength;
*    The  existence  of  powerful   interest  groups  that  have
developed (and live) by rules of the current economic
policies;
*    Competition from abroad  in  the  opened economy which sets
limits to the monopoli$tic pressures of business and labor.
4.59     So, many observers  expect  that  the  economic  policy of the new
Government will change  little  in  its main  lines.    It will be more a
question of different emphasis.
4.60     Other issues on the domestic front are as follows:
*    With political opening  and more  employment, labor unions
will become stronger and push for more power or cause re-
ductions in productivity in very sensitive areas: in the
ports, for instance, the key to the export success. As
seen by experts, there are countervailing forces to the
union's increased power.
*    Some relatively  easy  productivity gains--from corrections
of inefficiencies, more intensive capacity utilization, and
the use of comparative advantage may have been exhausted.
*    In general the foregoing points to slower growth or stepped
up investment, but capacity bottlenecks may be specific,
not   general--often   ICORs   (incremental  capital-output
ratios) are volatile and misleading indicators- (for ex-
ample, in ports and in some, but not all, of the highway
network), and the liberalization of the economy may permit
easy spotting of new *niches, for comparative advantage and
enhanced productivity.   In particular. Chilean businessmen
have mastered export skills, which are transferable with
relative ease from one trade to another.



- 124 -
*    There may be pressures  to  raise the investment ratio from
172 to 232. which vill  require  domestic savings of about
282 of GDP--not a very  realistic prospect.  An alternative
solution is more  investment  or  financing from abroad, or
some sacrifices in the rate of growth of investment or in
the recovery of social expenditures.
*    The situation of the public  sector may not be as solid as
it seems. Central Bank statements do not portray the full
extent  of  contingent  liabilities.    The  burden  of the
revised social security system on the budget already is
diminlshing, but will remain significant into the 1990s.
There will be stronger demands for social expenditure--for
health, education, housing, and investment in infrastruc-
ture. And the reduction in the VAT by 202 has narrowed the
room for maneuver.    Yet  the  privatization of previously
public firms and services in several fields, requiring
large investment in the medium-term, has released the
Government from those conmitments in the future, and the
authorities are consequently free to choose a different tax
package.
4.61     Even for many stable, efficient, growing economies, sustainability
is a daily battle. For Chile, it will be tested by the political economy
of a change in Government, by pressures to shift the emphasis to the social
sectors, by the move from recovery to expansion, and by the likely end of
the terms of trade windfall of the last two years. With all the uncertain-
ties about how the political economy will evolve, the continuity and recent
success of the adjustment policies has created a consensus around their
main tenets and strong interest in preserving them. How much the domestic
power structure--for instance, the role of labor unions--will change is not
yet clear. If the new political economy does not break with the main path
of the adjustment, in 1990 Chile will face its current problems--lesser in
magnitude than those of the 1980s--from a stronger internal position and
with favorable momentum. Although the external sector windfall of the last
years is likely to  end  and  some pressures  &re  likely to heighten, the
country is better equipped to handle them now than it was before. Many
observers think that Chile is more likely to return to a slower--but still
healthy--rate of  growth  (say  42  per  year)  than  to  retreat  from the
adjustment process.
B. Lessons from the Chilean SAP and the Bank's SAL Comonent
The Overall SAP
4.62     To draw lessons  from  experience  is a different--more demanding,
yet complementary--exercise from that of evaluating performance. To apply
such lessons in other places and moments requires considerations of repli-
cability. Lessons from experience are also learned experientially, and,
with all the richness of life, that mode of learning defies easy schemes
and classifications. The transfer of experience, in turn, requires sound
judgment and careful adaptation.



125 -
Backsround
4.63     What are the lessons  that  the  Chilean  SAP  can teach about the
background and rationale for such programs? Chile had followed liberaliza-
tion policies since the mid-1970s with fair success until the end of the
decade, and then they came to an abrupt and very painful end in early 1982.
4.64     There are several lessons  from  this  experience, which have been
reviewed at length elsewhere.101 Among the main ones are: the appreciation
of the exchange rate, permitted by the faster reaction of funds than goods
movements to the opening of the economy, and fueled by the recycling of
petrodollars; the persistence of unemployment, in part explained by wage
indexation; and very high real rates of interest, reflecting insufficient
fiscal policies, losing battles against exchange rate expectations, or
both. An important misconception at the time--accepted by the IMF, among
others--was that private foreign debt  did not  count.   It did count, and
Chile was hit hard when credits were not renewed and the exchange transfers
became a macroeconomic problem that detonated the exchange crisis. Another
mistake was to assume that firms would adapt rapidly to high real interest
rates--the rates were above the average return on assets--by selling and
reducing assets and cancelling debt. In fact, many of them were not able,
under heavy import competition, to generate funds. When interest rates are
that high, it is difficult to sell assets--impossible at normal prices--and
to cut down receivables. A specific, very costly error was the confusion
between market freedom and lack of prudential rules in the financial
sector, where funds of other people  are  managed.   This led to collusion
between banks and enterprises and facilitated their later collapse. But
despite its dramatic end, the first liberalization period left some posi-
tive effects in the economy:   relatively well-ordered fiscal management, a
productive structure more prepared for the opening of the economy, and
respect for price stability. It is widely recognized that the liberaliza-
tion policy of the 1970. had a significant influence In the positive supply
response to the SAP in the mid-1980s. It also led the productive sector to
reject a neoprotectionist assault in late 1984.
4.65     The 1982-84 crisis--with all  its suffering and confusion--and the
transition from it--unsustainable relief and a failed attempt to revive
protectionism--forced a sounder analysis of the situation. The lessons
were the need for a medium-term view to avoid the successive failures of
short-term approaches and the need to sustain confidence. The tough deci-
sions of setting and keeping a high exchange rate, in order to raise public
savings significantly and swiftly and to let real wages fall, both allowed
and were sustained by foreign finance (the concept of a "policy and finan-
cial package*).  The medium-ternm horizon  implied working with multiyear
projections that helped to trace the consequences of alternative courses of
action--for instance, the Mexican and Brazilian models of adjustment were
considered unsuitable.
101 See, for example, Ardito Barletta, Blejer, and Landau (1984).



- 126 -
DesiRn
4.66     What are the lessons  taught by  the  Chilean  SAP as regards the
design of such programs?    The  crucial concepts  of  the SAP were that a
medium-term approach was a necessary condition for short-term stabiliza-
tion, and that the policy and financial elements of the package, by mutual
reinforcement, provided the consistency and continuity of the program. In
the SAP, the BUchi economic team blended the approach of the 1970s--a free,
open, privately operated economy with fiscal equilibrium -- with a realis-
tic handling of specific problems    reasonable price bands for traditional
crops; some protection; freedom with SJIP-enforced prudential rules for
banking; moderate, stable export stmuli; wage restrictions to avoid unem-
ployment; debt conversion  schemes.    The moral  of  the story commends a
sound, simple conceptual framework and its adaptation to particular aspects
of reality.
4.67     Chile "owned" the programs    the  design was Chilean. The INF,
active since the early 1980s, provided support and policy advice. The
World Bank helped in warning about, estimating the size of, and discussing
the financial crisis with the SBIP as early as the second part of 1982. By
mid-1984 the Bank was active and preparing for future action in Chile.
'hen the program was conceived Chile had the worst ratio of foreign debt to
GDP in Latin America, with a current balance of payments deficit of US$2.1
billion. The open urban unemployment rate was 18.5t. Investment was 13.6Z
of GDP and domestic savings 12.6Z--not enough to finance investment; less
adequate to service the foreign debt. The overall fiscal deficit was, at a
maximum, 4.4Z of GDP--mostly because of near-peak expenditures of 30.71 of
GDP. The current fiscal surplus was far from being able to finance public
investments of 6.41 of GDP. The program design was clears
*   A high and stable  exchange  rate, to stimulate exports and
improve the trade balance;
*   A fiscal shock--initially on both supply and demand sides,
later with emphasis on expenditure restraint--to raise
public savings;
*   Au effort to  rehabilitate  the  financial  sector, thus to
increase private savings.
Macroeconomic projections made use of the Central Bank's econometric model.
This macro framework was directed at tackling the key vulnerabilities of
the Chilean economys   to  generate  the  external  and internal transfers
necessary to avoid the 'snowballing' of the foreign debt in the medium run
and to generate confidence in foreign and domestic lenders and investors so
as to fill the external gap and return the economy to the growth path.
This *core' was supplemented with mesures to develop noncopper exports-
-among them, the CSF--and efficient imrort substitution; later with volun-
tary debt reduction mechanisms; with other measures to reorder public
current expenditures and investment (later, to privatize public enterprise
activities); and with institutional changes in the financial markets.



-.127 -
Again, the SAP vas Chile's; if it incorporated ideas or suggestions from
the IMP or the Bank, in major respects this was done through coincidence or
persuasion and not by imposition.
4.68     MAother corollary is  a  clear  separation  of the essential--non-
negotiable--elements of the program, just  described, from other aspects or
effects. The latter (for example, some social effects) were either ignored
or palliated. Another element was that the SAP adopted fairly conservative
estimates of exogenous factors (for example, of copper prices--although in
this case conservatism may have not been purposeful). When it produced its
SAP, the Government projected the price of copper, which differed from
estimates made by the Bank (Table 4.19). Bank estimates were readjusted,
as the table shows. This prudent approach made the SAP look initially too
restrictive, but it worked well and left some leeway to respond to require-
ments later on.

... Not available.
4.69     The SAP could not have  been  the same without the Bank's support.
It lent it consistency (through its participation at the design stage) and
continuity (since its financial engagement had catalytic effects) helped
build favorable medium-term expectations in the economic operators and
reinforced the position of the  economic  team.   In other words, the Bank
helped to "sell' the SAP abroad and bought time to see the program's first
results. Key Bank contributions to the SAP design were the CSF, discussed
elsewhere--which afterward proved useful in discouraging expenditure temp-
tations--an end to the continuous drain of public funds, rehabilitation of
the financial system, and careful screening of investment projects. Priva-
tization of state enterprises--except intervened banks--was never a Bank
condition for its SALs. The economic team, however, was keen on the sub-
ject, and in recent years launched the *popular capitalism" initiative to
advance it.



- 128 -
4.70     On a conventional checklist  of  SAP  design elements, Chile would
show an almost perfect score.    It has improved efficiency through export
expansion, import liberalization, free prices (except in some traditional
crops), and better public expenditure and management of state enterprises.
It has also raised public and private savings significantly. The success
that has been achieved adds one more example to the global case record
confirming the correct orientation of this adjustment approach.
Implementation
4.71     What are the lessons  taught  by  the  Chilean  SAP as regards the
implementation of such programs? Implementation of the SAP in Chile admits
division into two stagess the crucial year 1985, during which the finan-
cial package and some aspects of the policy package were not yet final (SAL
I was signed on October 10, 1985), and the three following years, under
successive, uninterrupted Bank SALs. The genesis of the SAP can be traced
to 1984s3, when it was evident that the foreign debt situation and capital
flight would doom the economic approach and team. In late 1984 and early
1985 the guiding concepts and main lines of a new policy design became
clear to informed opinion in Chile, the IMF, and the Bank, which had rein-
forced its Chilean staff.    Chile  had  effective  negotiators and a tacit
agreement was reached with the Bank by March 1985, permitting the authori-
ties to behave "as if' the financial and policy package had been signed.
The difficult points in the deal with the Bank, which delayed signing, were
the CSF, the extent of financial rehabilitation, and relations with credi-
tor banks. The Bank's guarantee for co-financing a B highway loan suffered
a two-month delay, and initially the IMF and the Bank advised Chile against
providing State guarantees for private debts to foreign banks. The delays
in the agreement with the Bank increased some dangers: the agreement with
commercial banks was postponed until August 1985, the terms of trade
deteriorated, and  the  external  debt  situation  became  unsustainable in
April-May 1985. But while these delays weakened Chile's external position,
they also gave the creditor banks cause for reflection about the conse-
quences of not coming forward in support of the package. In any case, the
Chilean authorities gave up and agreed to guarantee private debts to
foreign banks (there were precedents in 1983). The subsequent position of
the IMF and the Bank  on  this  subject  seems  to have been one of "hands
off"--maybe reflecting the ambiguous position of some important board
members of its Executive Board.    In  the  second  part of 1985, while the
government decisively addressed its economic agenda, the Bank was active in
gathering funds for the financial side of the package. After signature of
SAL I, Bank staff accompanied Chilean officials on a tour of several
countries to close the financing of the 1985-87 needs from private sources.
4.72     A reading of the  experience  underlines  the importance of strong
political support and cohesion behind a SAP--that the program be 'owned' by
the country and clearly defined--and of the quality of the economic team
and technocracy.  This poses  the  question  of  the replicability of the
Chilean experiences Would it have been possible under a different polit-
ical economy? There can be as many counterfactual histories as ideological
angles. History provides examples of successes and failures under both
democratic and authoritarian regimes.

4.73     Another reading is the  Important  catalytic  effect of the Bank's
intervention, not only because of its financial comitment but also because
of the concurrence it showed with regard to the program's success. This
tends to indicate that it is wise for the hank to bide its time so as to
intervene only when the Government has shown its determination--while
accowpanying the Government's efforts during the process of design and
early implementation.
4.74     The program's implementation  after  the  first  SAL agreement was
excellent--helped especially since 1987, by positive external shocks (a
fall in oil prices, a rise in copper prices, lower interest rates and
dollar  prices,  world  economic  recovery).   The  administration  showed
restraint at several junctures, stopping an inflationary revival in 1987
and restraining a 1988  boom.   Also  important  in 1986-88 was the supply
response of the private sector, probably rooted in the liberalization
experience of the 1970s--not only with respect to entrepreneurial atti-
tudes, but also to the institutional setup. For instance, the efficiency
of Chilean ports, essential for the export drive, was in large measure the
result of previous policy decisions with regard to the workers' union. The
main lessons here are the importance of abiding by the right priorities and
keeping an eye on not failing because of early successes.
4.75     On a standard  checklist  of  implementation elements, the Chilean
performance would score very  hight    there were no serious difficulties;
lnstitutional reforms were smooth and, after sound studies, rapidly per-
formed by an efficient technocracy.    The Government commitment was excep-
tional, the external environment favorable and economic policies correct,
with some questions about nonprice policies. The Bank provided good advice
on the whole, although there was  some  dispute about the extent of social
and financial measures and  about  proper  disbursements.   Here again, the
evident success validates the usual criteria for the implementation of
SAPs.
Impact
4.76     What are the lessons taught by the Chilean eAP about the impact of
such programs? In Table 4.20 the performance of Chile under the SAP in
terms of the usual goals is compared with previous periods, with Latin
American countries as a whole, and with the program's goals. The SAP pro-
voked sharp, favorable trend reversals in all major objectives, with marked
improvements within the  period.    Chile  also outperformed Latin American
countries as a whole in the majority of variables and complied with practi-
cally all program goals--many of  them  In  excess.   The more specific SAL
actions were mainly qualitatives   directed toward export promotion, flnan-
cial rehabilitation, and the increase of savings and investment. The tar-
geted variables, in contrast, corresponded to the Government program and
IMF participation.

4.77     Almost all of the  overshooting  of the  GDP  growth goal can be
attributed to the direct effects of unanticipated positive external shocks:
mainly, favorable terms of trade and  lover  interest rates. To the extent
that these shocks had indirect effects, it can be argued that performance
without them--in the last 2 years of the SAP--would have fallen short of
th6 goals. But this reasoning ignores the policy reactions of the Govern-
ment and poses conditions different from those that happened. In any case,
a reading of the experience is that the model underlying the projections
portrays adequately the principal interactions of the Chilean economy.
4.78     The evolution of the social situation  under the SAP is a disputed
matter, as already discussed. The lesson to draw here is that the line of
not trading-off the main thrust of the SAP against short-run social
improvements paid off in  terms  of economic  growth and adjustment. Non-
essential concessions to palliate extreme or focused problems enhanced the
political sustainability with little  economic  cost.   An exercise in the
social costs of slower growth and vulnerability might sustain this reading.
4.79     On a conventional checklist of SAP  impact, Chile achieved an
almost perfect score. The trade-off between the resource balance and GDP
growth improved dramatically:
Latin                  Actual
Units      Chile   America   Program     Performance

The supply response to the SAP was fast, strong, and sustained. The fore-
cast of the external environment was conservative, since there were unex-
pected positive external shocks.  So, a  clear  lesson is that a SAP with
good design and implementation  produced very  good  results.   It is also
apparent that the windfall success  from external shocks changed little, if
any, of the Government's detenrmnation to pursue adjustment policies.

Sustainability
4.80     lhat lessons can the Chilean  SAP  teach with respect to the sus-
tainability of such programs? Clearly, there is not yet sufficient histor-
ical perspective to be sure about them. Chile is still undergoing profound
political transition and digesting the phasing out of intensive quick-
disbursing financial backing from international institutions. Besides,
there is always the question of the extent to which particular experiences
are replicable in reference to sustainability, a subject so much Imbedded
in the political economy of the individual country and in the external
environment. With all these caveats, some observations may be ventured.
One is that structural adjustment, as a form of social change, initially
faces resistance--the fear of costs to some is more perceptible than the
incentive of benefits to others--but as it proceeds, if convenient, gains
adepts and loses opponents.   In  this  sense, continuity of the program in
itself enhances  sustainability.    Chile  benefited  from  a long previous
liberalization period, which  is  not  a  replicable  experience.   But the
importance of continuity advocates, for the Bank, the practice of providing
successive SAL support during three- to five-year spans.
4.81     A second lesson  regarding  sustainability  is  the convenience of
creating, during economic upswings, reserves for downswings. That was the
experience with the CSF. But this same example provides another interest-
ing insight. Since it accumulated more funds, it was decided to spare some
of the CSF for foreign debt  buybacks.    That is, part of the reserves for
downswings was devoted to help solving longer-term problems. It can be
argued that this action tends to drive the adjustment policies in the
medium run.
4.82     Another observation is  that  features  of  the adjustment program
that involved the population directly--such as private pension funds and
"popular capitalisma--created broad support, thus increasing the chances of
survival of the respective policy elements.
4.83     One more perception is that,  although  at the time of launching a
SAP profound policy  changes  (decisive  Government  actions) and financial
support (the Bank's) play the leading roles, in terms of future sustain-
ability the function of institutional reforms  (more sticky and not so easy
to reverse) acquire  importance.    In  Chile  the  CSF, export credits and
insurance  systems,  and  the  organization   of ports  (this  reform  was
undertaken before the 1985 SAP) are established institutional changes that
supported the export  drive  and  diversification.    The  same is valid in
reference to savings mobilization.
4.84     On a standard checklist of elements favoring the sustainability of
SAPs, Chile scores high.    The  adjustment  policy  did not fall victim to
sociopolitical overoptimism and followed closely its original design, with
some adequate changes in emphasis and few concessions. There were signifi-
cant reforms and a widely recognized ability in economic management.

The SAL Component
4.85     This section presents the lessons taught by the Chilean experience
in reference to the main aspects of the SAP supported by the Bank's SALs.
Export Promotion
4.86     Chile's opening of  its  economy  included  the  promotion of non-
copper exports, the expansion of copper output cspacity, and efficient
import substitution. The erphasis was on the first--to expand and divers-
ify exports and reduce vulnerability to external shocks. Main lessons from
this effort were the overall importance of a reallstic and stable exchange
rate, whose credibility is a prerequisite for economic agents to invest in
an intrinsically risky activity, such as exporting. In fact, if weighted
by trade, the exchange rate kept depreciating until 1988, because of the
fall of the US dollar against other currencies.
4.87     Another observation is the importance  of having exports achieve a
critical mass that confers on interest groups--business, labor, etc.--suf-
ficient political power to avoid advocating economic policies that penalize
exports to the point of interrupting their normal flow. A good example was
the healthy reaction against a call in 1984 to reinstitute protectionism.
4.88     The role of  the  institutional  infrastructure  is also relevant.
Chile is a country distant from major world markets. However, it was able
to modify the operation of its ports so that, with very little investment,
they now count among the most efficient in the world, with their lower
operating costs compensating a large portion of Chile's higher freights
bill. But other institutional developments--in export insurance, credit and
promotion--were also of significant help.
4.89     Another angle is to look at export promotion "as a whole' - as the
program indeed did.    In  this  context,  the  focusing  of the PIP toward
exports as a first priority seems to have been very effectives high short-
term "new agriculture' programs, export-serving roads, fishing developments
received funds (instead of, for instance, long-maturity, capital-intensive,
massive transportation projects).
4.90     The Chilean experience,  however,  may not  be easily replicable,
because of country-specific factors favoring Chilet
* The supply response was facilitated by the existence of a
fluid market for agricultural land--a late result of the
agrarian reform of-the 1960s--and by the previous adjust-
ment of industry to Chile's exit from the Andean Pact and
trade liberalization in the 1970s.
* The high level of education that Chile vas able to main-
tain, a significant element in export development.
* The favorable development of the markets for Chilean
fruits, part of which were planted in the late 1960s and
early 1970s.



- 133 -
4.91     on a  conventional  checklist  of export  promotion elements, the
Chilean experience ranks wells   the  opening  of export markets kept pace
with the rate of export growth; the sequencing was correct, although non-
tariff restrictions had been removed almost totally before the SAP; and the
assistance given to the adjustment of foreign trade was approached as a
whole, with support for institutional, labor, infrastructural, and exten-
sion aspects. Initially there were high interest rates, and the fiscal
shock had to absorb same revenue losses from reduced import tariff rates.
As trade grew, revenue effects reversed, and then came the copper boom.
The notable improvement in the copper price, however, opened the gate to
expansionary pressures which the Government was able to resist. In the
end, the terms of trade windfall permitted the Government to have more
reserves and less debt. Significant import substitution projects are still
under way, and this area is likely to draw increasing attention in the
long-term consolidation of the structural adjustment.
The CSF
4.92     A very important Bank initiative  incorporated  in the SAP was the
CSF. It had to be negotiated with the Chilean authorities, who felt that
to single out one product for such treatment could lead to distortions in
price signals and resource allocation. But copper represented over half of
the country's exports, and the example of 'Dutch disease' was as clear as
any.  In fact, there are  two problems  here.   The first is that, leaving
aside the wide fluctuations characteristic of copper prices, such speciali-
zation has as its counterpart the backwardnesi of other export activities
and a very high vulnerability to external shocks or technological changes.
The second is that violent cycles in world copper prices also cause violent
expansions and recessions of domestic activity and prices, which in turn
not only trigger social tensions and economic losses, but also blur price
signals for long-term resource allocation.
4.93     In Chile, as seen above, the  first  problem was tackled by a pro-
gram to promote noncopper exports and the second through the CSP. A fea-
ture that is not always present in countries with similar problems is that
801 of Chile's copper exports were in the hands of a state enterprise. If
the variable taxisubsidy implied by the CSF has been applied to private
firms, there would have been incentives to underinvoice sales abroad in
order to reap fiscal benefits.  There are alternative instruments to steri-
lize cycles in export earnings--such  as  the placement of Government bonds
denominated in foreign currency, which of course puts the burden of stabil-
ization on the entire economic commuilty instead of the industry in ques-
tion--but these work not through the goods' price mechanism but through
asset prices. The key lesson is not to let foreseeable sources of fluctua-
tion interfere with stabilization and adjustment goals. The CSF success-
fully complied with this rule and is a commendable mechanism for similar
cases.



_ 134 -
Public Sector Management
4.94     A feature of the Chilean  fiscal situation not replicated in other
large debtor countries is that it had surpluses in the years immediately
before the 1982 crisis, and the public debt was accordingly low. Even at
its worst, in 1984, the fiscal deficit did not reach 5Z of GDP, and it
already included the cost of transforming the social security system (which
will peak in the mid-1990s and then will gradually fade away). At the
start of the SAP, the main problems In public finances were, in addition to
the social security change, the costs of the E8Ps and the guarantees of
private foreign debts. The public cost of the financial rehabilitation is
not reflected so much in the fiscal account, as in Central Bank statements.
The main actions were current expenditure restraint (at the beginning,
lower real wages and no readjustment of old pensions) and better tax
collection (initially, of the VAT and, later, due to expanded activity).
Additional sources of relief were the sales of State enterprises which--in
contrast to the experience of other countries--were profitable. Thus, the
effects on the public cash flow were positive initially but negative after-
ward, when the surpluses of those companies stopped feeding the Treasury.
Thus, the improvement of public savings in recent years may underestimate
the effort expended. In the longer run, the sales of those enterprises
also transfer to the private sector the financing of the capacity expan-
sions required. About half of the proceeds from the sales were devoted to
reduce the fiscal deficit. Another, later relief to public sector finance
came from the rise in copper prices.
4.95     The main lessons from Chile's public sector management are differ-
ent expressions of centuries-old  sound  criteria:   austerity and sensible
administration. Additional sources of revenues have been reviewed, but the
backbone of the success was tough decisions on the expenditure side, some
firmly proposed and backed by  the  Bank.    The administration was able to
institute cuts in wages and pensionss to contain EEPs and health expendi-
tures, under severe pressure, by formulating creative and focused programs;
to streamline the PIP by increasing the return and quality of investments-
-for example, in agriculture and water supply; and, finally, to resist
demands of expenditure expansion during the copper bonanza.
4.96     As in other components of the SAL, Chile performed well when meas-
ured against a conventional checklist of public administration elements.
Decentralization was  organized,  though  not  synchronized.    The fiscal
effects of high interest rates and devaluations were compensated by those
of trade liberalization improvement of the tax system. Solutions to fiscal
problems did not suffer from delays. A debated aspect, already treated, is
whether social expenditure could have been kept at a higher level. But at
what alternative cost?  Here a recurrent theme again appears:  How replica-
ble is the experience of resisting pressures especially on the social bud-
get--in such a difficult time, under different political conditions? This
subject has already been addressed.

Financial Rehabilitation
4.97     To draw lessons from  the financial rehabilitation policies within
Chile' SAP requires a  conceptual  framework.    An  approach is to build a
typology of crises affecting business activities as a whole in developing
countriest
Balance of Payments Crisis           Domestic Financial Crisis
No          Yes
No                           Type I     Type III
Yes                           Type II     Type IV
4.98     Situation I is normal:  no  crisis  of any kind.  In situation II
there is no across-the-board crisis  internally.   Once the Government has
run out of credit and reserves, it can either establish exchange controls
or let the exchange rate explode.    In the first case, when their foreign
debts become due, enterprises will pay--or consign in deposit--to the
Central Bank the value of the debt in local currency at the official
exchange rate and thus transfer to the State the obligation with the for-
eign creditor. The State takes the exchange risk. In the second case,
the value of the debt in local currency will explode accordingly, and-
-given the basic assumption--there will also be a domestic financial
crisis. The situation moves to Type IV.
4.99     In situation III  there  is  an across-the-board internal crisis,
but the balance of payments is in good shape. Enterprises are unable to
comply either with their local or with their foreign debts. Since there
is a generalized crisis, the Government will bail out the firm with pub-
lic funds, trying to spread the monetary effects over time. This means
refinancing or reducing business debts, or any combination of both. The
problem for the authorities is how to make foreign creditors share (pro-
portionally) in the cost of  the  bail  out.   The bargaining situation is
that of a creditors' club without formal rules of the game. Since the
foreign creditors know that the State has a large stake in the game, they
will refuse to pay any cost--as is generally done by small creditors. So
it is up to the Government to pose a credible threat--that it is not dis-
posed to pay all the tab itself--so as to get some contributions from
foreign creditors. The situation is much more complicated because there
are thousands of firms, there is a race against time, and the State cannot
act discretionally.
4.100    In situation IV the two  crisis occur simultaneously.  Firms will
probably try to pay foreign rather than local debts, not only because they
are more difficult to reschedule, but because they will prefer to get rid
of the exchange risk.   But  if  the  crisis  is deep enough they will pay
neither--in which case the situation resembles that of type III. The
corollary is that widespread foreign debts of private firms do not commit
the Government as long as the economy is in a normal situation (type I).



- 136 -
If there is a balance of payments crisis, the Government bears the
exchange risk. If there is a domestic financial crisis, the State bears
the brunt of the cost, and it is unlikely that it will succeed in trans-
ferring to foreign creditors  their  proportional  share.    It is in this
light that the Chilean experience can be probed for future guidance.
4.101    The lesson here is not  to  confuse market freedomlll (which says
that banks will compete in rates to gather funds but will also be prudent
in their loans so as to attract depositors with low-risk portfolios) with
lack of prudential regulations  (which  sets  limits to risk concentration
and self-credits).  Setting  aside delinquent behavior, many entrepreneurs
and bankers will feel  tempted  to  pay  high interest rates in supposedly
high-yield ventures, thus  incurring  risk concentration and self-credits,
which are very vulnerable to  crisis.    The high rates lure depositors to
them, thus channeling a  larger  share  of  savings to risky destinations.
Furthermore, in the initial stage of the crisis, the banks with such port-
folios pay ever higher rates of interest in order to keep pumping money
into those uncreditworthy firms in order to avoid their bankruptcy which
would uncover their own  insolvency.    The prudential rules and financial
surveillance established in Chile under the SAP, with the Bank's assis-
tance, are now considered a model for other countries in similar difficul-
ties.
4.102    What are the benefits  and  costs  of Government intervention and
subsidies in that situation? The benefits are to avoid the collapse from
macroeconomic mismanagement, an ensuing financial crisis of companies and
banks otherwise economically viable in the long term, and the adomino
effect' of their bankruptcies.   Government measures in this regard should
not include bailing out businesses and financial institutions that are
insolvent because of their own poor management or long-run unviability.
The benefits cannot be completely separated from the particular rehabili-
tation mechanisms employed and their  costs.   Insofar as there are inter-
dependencies, the application of the methodology of cost effectiveness to
select the course of action is impaired.
4.103    The costs to the country  of  preventing  the collapse are of two
kinds. The first is that foreign creditors are likely to share less of
the burden in the case of rehabilitation than in the case of bankruptcies-
-but under the circumstances the total burden should be larger for bank-
ruptcies. The second relates to the consequences of how the costs of
rehabilitation incurred by the public sector are imposed on the community
as a whole and how they are financed. That the rehabilitation is largely
an internal transfer should not obscure the fact that it is costly in
terms of resources for those who pay, and it is reflected either in less
investment or consumption (or both), directly or through higher interest
rates or inflation (or both).   All these are difficult concepts to define
111 A costly curiosityt the 1002 deposit insurance survived through the
liberalization  period,  eliminating  for   the  depositors  the  risk
differentials between banks--thus favoring those which paid high
rates--and held the State liable in the case of banks' default.



-137-
and measure. Nevertheless, the cost of State guarantees for private for-
eign debts furnish a first indication of costs of the first kind, and the
amount of public subsidies to firms and banks give an idea of costs of the
second kind.
4.104    The moral here is  to  adopt  rehabilitation measures directed at
achieving the benefits as defined above, and thus to limit the costs.
This often calls for making the "stock' losses explicit rather than
extending *flow' losses, and then designing how these losses would be
supported and financed, trying to avoid their inflationary impact; to
strike a balance between present and future burden distribution; and to
distort price signals and resource allocation as little as possible.
Awareness of the effects of the balance of payments crisis on the domestic
financial situation began in 1982--with the Bank's help--as did some meas-
ures of relief. But the full extent of the effects became manifest only
in 1983 when, over bickering with the finance minister, international
banks discontinued their credits to Chile, and the main business groups
and local banks were intervened  by  the  Government.   The Bank played no
role beyond providing technical assistance at this stage.
4.105    Initially the salvage was expensive  and inefficient, since 1985
less so, and later on, the costs diminished under Bank pressure. Many
Chilean authorities tend still to underplay the consequences of the bail
out, just because they were able to avoid its inflationary impact by fis-
cal improvements and indebtedness.   In  this  sense, they charge that the
Bank did not fully understand the financial side of the rescue, it proba-
bly misjudged the size of the problem, and so it was unduly worried.
Chilean officials are also very keen at underscoring the public cost of
the bail out--not always with solid reasons--maybe as a reaction to criti-
cism. So the Government involvement had two faces. The first is that the
public cost was very high--some estimates place it at 502 of a year's GDP
(cumulative total until it disappears); others in a lower range. The
second is that the burden was allocated and financed with relatively
little macroeconomic--especially  monetary--disturbances,   partly  as  a
result of good overall economic policy (that is, strong Inducements for
saving).
4.106    The costs of rehabilitation  and  reconstruction of the financial
sector included the losses for liquidation of financial entities; the
difference between the disbursements to capitalize banks and the reim-
bursements from the sales of those stocks, in present value terms; and the
assistance to debtors (portfolio purchase and sale-back swap agreements,
subsidies on dollar deposits, preferential exchange rates, and so on).
The exchange rate losses from the transfer of private foreign debt were
sizable--albeit an internal, not external cost.   The purchase by the pub-
lic of intervened financial entities was heavily subsidized--at prices
discounted up to 30Z, with interest-free (but indexed) financing by CORFO,
and with tax incentives.   The  AFPs took shares, but recapitalization had
multiple objectivess to do it without estatization", a usual temptation,
to make old stockholders bear a cost (though not full), and to avoid con-
centration of ownership. Portfolio swaps amounted to 3.5 times the equity



- 138 -
of the financial institutions and the subsidy was about 2Z a year. Some
entities have not been able to reduce this portfolio at an acceptable
rate, and the situation may snowball.
4.107    The Bank accompanied  the  process  by  shifting  the emphasis in
successive SAL*t In SAL I it was to stabilize the financial sector; SAL
II aimed to stop the Government's involvement in the sector; and SAL III
sought to capitalize financial entities (their 1987188 profits were satis-
factory) and to develop capital  markets.    The Bsank played an especially
useful role in providing guidance and support in Chile's developing an
exemplary system of prudential rules and surveillance--with the help of
outside consultants--penalizing nonproductive risks and trying to improve
the management of State banks, even though these were the most affected by
the crisis.
4.108    Each financial crisis  is  a unique,  at least partly unexpected
experience (otherwise it would not have occurred). Thus, the replicabil-
ity of the lessons is  limited.    Observations  from the Chilean case are
that the initial panic and disorder tend to induce inefficient and costly
salvage measures, and that it is best--as soon as the situation is stabi-
lized--to make the stock losses and stop the bail-out as fast as possible.
The benefits of a rapid recapitalization, without statization, of the
system in terms of confidence, fluidity, and saving-investment behavior
will justify incorporating a subsidy component in the stock sales to the
public.
Social and Other Sectors
4.109    Assessing the social costs of the 1985 Chilean SAP is a different
exercise than appraising such costs of liberalization-stabilization-
adjustment for the whole period of the previous Government, starting in
1973. Assessment of the social costs of the 1985 SAP can resort to com-
parisons with either counterfactual histories (which could be successful
or unsuccessful policy approaches tried in other Latin American countries)
or with the situation in 1984, with cases of failure In the design, lmple-
mentation, or management of economic adjustment programs.
4.110    In comparative terms, Chile  has traditionally shown higher rela-
tive social expenditure thas the rest of Latin America.  This may reflect,
at least partially, that Chile is not a federal nation; consequently, the
budget also includes claims that in federal countries would pertain to the
states. It is difficult to draw conclusions from intercountry compari-
sons, since the public coverage of social services varies from one to
another. During the early years of the SAL period, the behavior of public
social expenditure was as shown in Table 4.15. Some social services were
increasingly provided by the private sector (for example, the growth of
ISAPREs). As for unemployment, the policy was to reduce the expenditure
in EEPs, keeping pace with the evolution of economic recovery and employ-
ment while streamlining the EEPs to gain efficiency. The most controver-
sial of the social sectors has been health.

4.111    The key charge of  the  critics  is that health expenditures were
too low; that this led to a marked deterioration of social services and
the population's well-being; that special programs to palliate these
effects did not change the overall trend in the sector, were devoted to
easy and superficial goals, and created many situations of inequitytl2t
and that reductions in the VAT and progressive taxes could have been
replaced by more social  expenditures.   Past Government officials argued,
in contrast, that the containment of current expenditures was compensated
by  better  management  and   by   programs   focused  on  acute  problems
(malnutrition  and maternal-child  health),  and  that  social indicators
showed consistent progress in 1985-87.   Greater social expenditures would
certainly  have  modified  the main  thrust  of  economic  policy.    One
observation is that a large share of containment in social expenditures
came from a fall in real wages of civil servants, including doctors and
teachers. Another is that focused efforts to alleviate narrowly defined-
-often  pressing--problems  are  no   substitute  for  long-term  sectoral
solutions and in some cases create imbalances that increase tensions
later.13/ In both cases, the corollary is that the effort extracted from
and the palliatives given to, the social sectors, although congruent with
the economic policy approach, are short-term measures that will need to be
re-examined. Future projections should therefore take into account the
need  for  some   further   adjustments--for  example,  include  selective
corrections of real wages and increased attention to heretofore neglected
current expenditures such  as maintenance.    Several estimates place the
public cost of these adjustments in the range of 32 to 4Z of GDP. Another
corollary is that the adjustment years should be used to design and begin
structural changes in the social sectors, too, and that the phasing out of
multilateral structural adjustment assistance may contemplate some loans
for the social sectors from the Bank or other official sources.
4.112    On a conventional checklist  of  social  components of a SAP, the
Chilean program added only temporary--in its last year if any--strains.
The poverty impact of the economic crisis had reached its peak in 1982.
Calorie intake, however, behaved as shown in Table 4.21. The most impor-
tant special programs, the EEPs, were launched before the SAP, and un-
employment had already passed 'ts  peak.   Targeted programs shoved varied
success, with nutrition programs ranking among the highest. On the whole,
such efforts were oriented toward the poor.
12/ For instance, financing housing for better-off groups.
13/ For example, lower-middle-class residents, who do not qualify for some
social programs, are worse off than poor people who do qualify.

C. Lessons from the Bank's Structural Lending Activity
4.113    This section presents the  lessons  offered by the Chilean experi-
ence with reference to the Bank's related SAL activity.
Preparation
4.114    What are the lessons  from  the  Chilean  case with respect to the
Bank's preparation for a  sequence  of  SALs?    In  the late 1970s and the
beginning of the 1980s developing countries found--through their public and
private sectors--abundant and easy financing from international commercial
banks that imposed no ties and conditions on their loans (as the IMP and
the Bank do). So Chile, like some other countries, showed little interest
in the Bank loans. At the sae time, some members of the Bank's Executive
Board showed concern  about political  conditions  in  Chile.   The Bank's
activity in the country dwindled, and the Bank reduced the number of its
staff assigned to Chile. During the 1982-83 crisis the IMP was active in
Chile while the Bank was passive--with a few exceptions. An important one
was the Bank's assistance in assessing the magnitude of the financial
crisis. It was only by mid-1984 that a change in attitude on the part of
the Chilean authorities, a Bank Vice-President's go-ahead, and-new Bank
staff in charge of Bank activities In Chile returned the Bank to active
involvement in the country. In the meantime, for three years Chile muddled
through one of its worst economic crises, and a possible way out--in 1983,
under Finance Minister Caceres--lapsed.
4.115    A consequence of this  lapse  is  that, when  the Bank did become
active again, the main lines of the Government's economlc policy had
already been devised. The Bank made important additional advisory contri-
butions, but the basic design of measures to ameliorate the crisis already
existed. The point is of little practical importance, since there were
fundamental overlaps of agreement, but it could be significant elsewhere.
The lesson here is the convenience that can be gained by the Bank's keeping
a more permanent, ongoing dialogue--if no physical presence--with a country
even in periods of relatively little lank activity.141 Of course there are
141 For cost reasons, this may not be possible for very small countries.



- 141 -
cost considerations, but it is a question of quality rather than quantity
of Bsank staff involvement.   Coordination  and division of labor with other
international financial institutions could reduce sone of the costs to the
Bank, but there are limits  to  this.    Not only do the specific, mandated
functions of the international institutions dlffer, but some courterpoint
in following the evolution of a country's economy is beneficials it pro-
vides more than one point of view (for example, the IMP was overoptimistic
about its monetary approach in Chile in the late 19709), it avoids feedback
effects of small groups, and it fosters more realistic discussion of the
issues. Perhaps the most important lesson is that loss of contact with
developments In a country during periods of low Bank activity there places
the Bank in a passive position, devoid of empirically-rooted initiative.
4.116    Once the Bank became  active  again  in  Chile, preparation of the
SALs complied with practically all the major yardsticks. With the excep-
tion of some aspects of SAL II, discussed later, there was economic and
sector work and policy dialogue for all three main components of the SALs.
There was a fairly explicit, comprehensive macroeconomic frame.  Stabiliza-
tion and adjustment policies were integrated. There was no excessive opti-
mism. either about external conditions or burden sharing by the interna-
tional commercial banks. The SAP bet initially on intensity; as it turned
out, it was a well-calculated political risk because the program proved to
be realistic and flexible.  Host  important,  the country 'owned' the pro-
gram. Not only did Chile have the initiative, it also had implemented a
large (key) part of the adjustment program by the time SAL I was signed.
Meanwhile, Chile was supported by the IMF's SF? and the Bank encouraged the
authorities to proceed 'as if' the SAL and the financial package were
forthcoming. This arrangement was mutually reinforcing and worked success-
fully, and here there is a second lesson to draw.
Conditionality
4.117    Before the current SAP,  Chile underwent a decade-long liberaliza-
tion period, interrupted by the  1982  crisis.   When the Bank approved its
SAL I in 1985, the IMP had already approved an EEF for Chile. These two
facts explain why the macroeconomic conditions for Bank assistance to Chile
were less strong than for  other  countries.   Changes in emphasis from one
SAL to another were reflected in these conditions.
4.118    In general, SAL I  is  considered  as  the  one with the strongest
design. Well-focused on the larger SAP, its emphasis was on two key varia-
bles, savings and exports, in the transition to a more open economy with
better resource mobilization and allocation.    SAL TI placed the accent on
financial rehabilitation. On this point there are different perceptions.
Several observers think that the Bank's worries over the public cost of
financial rehabilitation were  exaggerated.    Most  others, however, think
that the Banks insistence on stopping Government subsidies to the finan-
cial sector was right and timely--and anticipated reconstruction of the
system, even if it caused some penuries in the short term. SAL III was



- 142 -
different. The targets were more dispersed and less focused on supporting
the core objectives of the SAP.  At the suggestion of the Bank's Executive
Board and some staff members--probably out of caution for the social
unsustainability of the SAP--various social programs were incorporated.
They were designed hurriedly by the Chileans when the Bank could not be
dissuaded from its insistence, some on the basis of hurried missions.
Although some of these programs were successful, they were not integrated
in long-term sectoral strategies.   They also quantitatively increased, but
qualitatively reduced, conditionality.    More  important, they lowered the
institutional level of administration and involved different jurisdictions,
making control of program execution very complex.
4.119    This turn in the last  SAL  is the subject of widespread criticism
in Chile. The high-level economic authorities would have preferred mainte-
nance of SAL I's emphases--the groundwork had been laid--rather than pro-
liferation of  new  targets  and  some  diffusion  of  original objectives.
Lower-level officials in the social sectors concerned, while conceding some
benefits, resented interventions and ad hoc activities outside their
general strategies.  Government critics point  out the number of targets as
an example  of politically motivated  foreign  interference  in internal,
microeconomic affairs and emphasize the inequities resulting from isolated,
single-sector efforts.
4.120    A first observation  here  is  the  convenience  of having a small
number of policy  conditions--four  to  six  as  a  rule of thumb--that are
related to the core objectives  of  the  SAP and whose compliance should be
strictly controlled.   Other  less  essential  aspects  could be subject to
program monitoring unrelated to  tranche  releases.    Even if unrelated to
tranche releases, it is advisable to limit to a minimum the number of con-
ditions imposed on subjects that do not strictly pertain to the key adjust-
ments. A corollary is to select, as far as possible, results rather than
actions as subjects of control. This has to do with the first observation,
since it is more common to find a target requiring several actions than an
action achieving several targets.    The  corollary, however, should not be
absolute because there are considerations (for example, sustainability)
that call more for institutional developments than for observable results,
and results can be the effects of causes other than the actions undertaken.
Another lesson that seems obvious--to make 'adequate' modifications in the
policy conditions of successive SALs--ls not so obvious if posed in slight-
ly different form. That is, to give equal weight to the following two
rules: revise the policy conditions if they are 'wrong," and not to revise
the conditions if they are right." Es post analysis of behavior is likely
to show that the first rule weighs more heavily than the second.15/ Last
but not least, another lesson is the importance of careful preparatory
151 Clearly this is a far cry from the suggestion that SALs should be given
for longer terms with more tranching, which makes the targets rigid and
the cost of noncompliance higher for the country through its effect on
expectations.



- 143 -
economic and sector work, in close contact between the country and the
Bank, as a basis for the determination of reasonable conditionality, vhich
then becomes the shared objectives.
Monitorins
4.121    Chile's compliance with policy conditions  was so good and evident
that it left little role for monitoring. On the one hand, there were a few
cases of near compliance: adjustment slower than expected in 1985 (SAL I
was signed in October); fiscal results-worse than expected, by 0.12 of GDP,
in 1986 and--as public savings--0.32 in 1987; an inflation slippage of 6.5S
in 1987--more a concern of the IMP--corrected to 0.3X in 1988. On the
other hand, there were notable overcompliances, as in growth of the exter-
nal gap and in the current account of the balance of payments. Thus, the
monitoring function was more one of the Bank's alerting the Chilean author-
ities about some developments and speeding up the relevant actions. But
the Bank's monitoring performed another important function: the mid-term
missions, on whose reports tranche releases were decided, also set the
basic elements for the design of the next SAL.
4.122    A message is, then, that six-month  tranching leads to a timing of
missions that enables monitoring to perform both the function of control
and of setting the basic elements of the next SAL.16/ A corollary is that
monitoring should not be too narrowly focused on compliance, but also
should consider relating the SAL to the overall progress of the larger SAP.
Phasing Out
4.123    The Tables 4.22 and 4.23  present a recent (April 1989) projection
of the capital account of the Chilean balance of payments and also portray
the phasing out of adjustment assistance from international financial
institutions. The figures in the tables show the usual pattern of rapid
disengagement by the IMP and slower decline of net flows from the Bank,
which keeps up the level of gross disbursements while amortizations
increase. These disbursements will come from the financial market and from
second Bank housing, road sector, and industrial finance loans, which are
sectorally focused continuations of SAL aspects. The Chilean authorities
would have prepared a fourth SAL, but the Bank regarded this gradual phase-
out as reasonable. The first observation is the convenience of setting a
time limit--three to five years at most as a rule of thumb--for successive
SALs and a prospective phase-out program from the outset (lest the support
become a substitute for domestic effort and prolong the debt situation, and
also to avoid the accumulation of  amortizations).   A second lesson is the
need for a fairly gradual phase-out scheme in countries whose export earn-
ings are volatile and dependent on external factors.
16S SAL III had twelve-month tranching, but no further SAL was foreseen.

4.124    A final matter related with  the  phasing  out, is the feeling of
some Chilean observers that the country's good behavior may not have been
worth the effort and pain, since other countries that did not undertake as
stringent an adjustment effort are currently able to repurchase their debts
on terms cheaper than those esacted from Chile and may be bailed out by the
Brady plan. This line of thought requires careful consideration, because
first, early adjustment sacrifices were supported financially by interna-
tional institutions, and these institutions have received compensation from
the sustained progress since 1986; second, the market--although belatedly-
-will reward that behavior in the future;17/ and third, because the Brad;
plan will have positive spillovers in Chile too. Still, a corollary is to
171 This point  should  not  be  overemphasized.    Resumption of voluntary
lending has been slow to corn. Future lending decisions depend on past
debtor behavior but on other factors as well.



- 145 _
avoid, as far as possible, the introductiou of perverse incentives--those
which encourage countries not to adjust--in the design of solutions to the
debt problem, a well known principle,
The Bank's Relations with Country Authorities
4.125    In the whole process of  a  SAL sequence, the Bank's relations are
with the debtor country, with other international institutions (especially
the IMF) and with other lenders.    The relations with Chile were not close
until the 1982 crisis and became active only in the second part of 1984.
The reason for this may lie in, among other causes, a misunderstanding
originating in the Bank's draft economic report of 1981, which apparently
sounded a warning of impending difficulties.  Another Bank document of that
tine, in contrast, predicted  sustained  prosperity.    It seems clear that
there was a mutual lack of strong interest on both sides; perhaps due to
other priorities and, perhaps,  political  aspects.   This state of affairs
was reflected in weak--or no--Chilean informational efforts in the Bank and
in little Bank staff effort devoted to Chile. There is no indication of a
strong interaction between Bank staff and Chllean authorities until a small
revival of activity in late 1982 and then the turning point in 1984.
Although there are explanations for this discontinuity, it did not go
unnoticed in Chile that during the worst of the crisis the IMF was present
and active and the Bank was not.18/
4.126    Since then, Bank relations with  Chile  have been close and excel-
lent, and the level and performance of both the Chilean authorities and
negotiators and Bank's staff have been very good. In addition, there is in
Chile a widespread appreciation of the open attitude of Bank staff, (shown
by their contacts with different groups) in and outside the Government. It
has been mentioned by several Chilean officials, however, that the (high)
rate of job rotation of Bank personnel, which implies rebuilding contacts
anew,  and  (frequent)  organizational   changes,  requiring  learning  new
procedures, take their toll  on  smooth  relations.   In a few nonessential
areas, it was also considered by the Chilean authorities that some Bank
missions were not always necessary or well-prepared.
4.127    Relations  between  Chile  and  other  international  institutions
-especially the IMP--were cordial and close, allowing collaboration, cross-
fertilization, and coordination of respective functions and, avoiding con-
flicts and, to a large extent, duplication of efforts. This was evident in
the homogenization of conditionality.    In  some cases, upon Bank evidence
the IMF modified the values of some targets. Finally, relations with cred-
itors was neither close nor distant.   The Bank could not persuade the com-
mercial banks in 1985 to waive their requirement of a state guarantee of
foreign private debt, and negotiation of the B-loan cofinancing was diffi-
cult but successful. Later that year, the Bank played a significant role
181 Of  course  there was  some  assistance  and  some  lending,  but not
involvement in an essential sense.



- 146 -
in helping the Chilean authorities--through a demanding tour- to secure
from commercial banks the additional funding needed to complete the finan-
cial package. It also regularly provided supportive statements for finan-
cial packages involving debt renegotiations.
4.128    There are few lessons  to  draw here.  Some of the possibilities
involve choosing a locus in the trade-off between closeness of relations
and cost, a subject addressed under the next heading, below. Relations
with the IVW are defined with reference to overall objectives and the
charter of that institution. A final reflection is that resolution of the
developing country debt problem--to which solution the SALs contributed--is
likely to require that some  institution play a leading role--including the
shepherding of coamercial banks.    But  in  that case, such an institution
would need enhanced resources, capabilities, and political support to carry
out its mandate.
Questions of Cost and Efficiency
4.129    In drawing lessons from the Chilean SAP and the Bank's SALs, ques-
tions arise about efficiency and cost aspects of the Bank's operations.
Some of these are specific to the SALs, and others are more general.
4.130    The first centers around SAL  III,  which In contrast to the other
SALe--in which there was a coincidence of views--a compromise had to be
reached to include several studies and programs in the social and other
sectors. The perception in Chile is that, at the Bank's insistence, SAL
III delved too deeply into sectoral microeconomics, with a resultant sharp
deterioration of cost efficiency.    At  first the sectoral authorities re-
sisted the intervention, which they felt abrogated sectoral strategies in
favor of disconnected, alien  programs.    Complexities were encountered in
dealing with and coordinating different jurisdictions and multiple agencies
of lower hierarchy. All these factors cause delays, poor organization, and
difficulties in control. The conclusion is that as far as possible, SALs
should stay macroeconomic and general and should avoid becoming enmeshed in
minute administrative details. Such concentrated microeconomic involvement
is not in their essence. Nor is it the essence (or expertise) of the job
of the Government officials charged with complying with such conditions.
Sector loans are a better vehicle to achieve this type of objective.
4.131    The more general questions refer  to the losses in cost efficiency
from organizational changes and personnel rotation in the Bank, to the
adequacy of the Bank's institutional memory and to the supposedly excessive
frequency or (superficiality) of the Bank's missions.191 Clearly, these
subjects exceed the scope of this audit evaluation and must be consigned to
the Bank's review of  its  overall  organizational  policy.   Perhaps it is
useful simply to observe that, in many cases, the increase in efficiency
justifies the cost of adequately briefing Bank mission members.
19/ These last comments refer particularly to missions related to the
peripheral components of the SALs.



- 147 -
Evaluation
4.132    It is in the nature  of  evaluations  to  try to encompass all the
richness of reality with an open mind, without preconceived and rigid for-
mats and beyond mere registration of compliance with targets. But it helps
an evaluator to know, as explicitly as possible, the simplified 'model' of
reality that underlay the program and targets pursued. The Chilean SAP
made use of the econometric model of the Central Bank of Chile, and some
exercises were also done using the RMSM of the World Bank.
4.133.  Another important element is institutional memory.  It is not only
the question of the  availability  of  records--and for the matter persons-
-but also of the easy and speed of its retrieval--or interviews--and of
their selectivity and classification.   In  the  case of Chile, this exper-
ience has been satisfactory, given the logistical support of OED. All key
documents were made accessibles   initiating memos, back-to-office reports,
decision meeting minutes, President's reports, letters of development
policy, Board discussions, loan agreements, progress reports, country
program and strategy reports, and files on the whole SAL process. A large
majority of the Bank staff who participated in SAL decision making were
also made available. The briefing in Washington before the audit mission
to Chile was extremely useful.
4.134.   A final element is the methodology of evaluation, whether there is
a blueprint or an index of topics for the exercise. Although evaluation
does not lend itself easily to typologies, the Bank has developed useful
guidelines. As a contribution to this end, for those parts of the exercise
amenable to rigorous analytical treatment, 'A Methodology for Quantitative
Ex Post Evaluations' is included as a Technical Appendix to this report.
Programs and evaluations, however, can rely only partially on rigorous
modeling exercises of this kind--and in any case, it is difficult to choose
the 'best' among such models, if  this  exists.   To have available the few
computer runs that were taken into account in designing a program or set-
ting its targets, however, would be useful for understanding the rationale
applied and the options faced in the design stages to grasp the 'black
box' of interrelations mong variables, as well as among objectives and
policies.
4.135    Considerations of efficiency and cost--also a term of reference in
evaluations--point in the same  direction.   Institutional memory is satis-
factory and certainly quite good in comparative terms. The cost of obtain-
ing additional improvements are probably prohibitively high in terms of
scarce institutional resources--staff time.   The marginal benefits seem to
be modest, given the limits of the absorptive capacity of both the Bank's
staff and outside evaluators. A practice of the utmost importance is con-
tact with a large and varied sample of persons in the recipient country.
These individuals bring points of view, empirical data, and variety of
perceptions and value judgments impossible to grasp or imagine from outside
the country context. It is this vivid experience that adds content and
conviction to the evaluation, an exercise always in danger of remaining
formal or superficial.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX
METHODOLOGY FOR QUANTITATIVE EX POST EVALUATIONS
Since their inception in the late 19609 and early 1970s ex post
evaluations of macroeconomic programs and projects, especially by
international institutions, have become widespread.11 Yet, I have seen no
satisfactory comprehensive methodology for such appraisals.21 Maybe this is
due to the importance of qualitative assessments in these exercises.
This paper is an attempt to provide a formal comprehensive
methodology for ex post evaluations amenable to treatment in quantitative
terms. Since the aim of this practice is more to learn lessons for the
future than to judge past performance, it becomes even more important, when
comparing targets with results, to assign the deviations to different
causes. The typology of causes should not only permit such allocation but
also be designed so as to facilitate the feedback of learned lessons to
future actions.
A natural classification of sources of deviations (results versus
goals) is between those due to design and those due to implementation.31 In
turn, inadequate design can originate in the inaccurate assessment and
projections of external events, in the setting of inappropriate or
unrealistic goals, or in poor understanding of the way the relevant system
works. Poor implementation, the failure to achieve targets, may be due to
insufficient performance at different levels of the chain of conmand (see
footnote 2).
At this stage, it becomes clear that the Tinbergen approach to
economic policy,4J with its classification of variables, provides a good
starting point for constructing a methodology for ex post evaluations
--since projects and programs are policies in action.
1/ For reviews of methods, organization, and experience, see: Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD (1972 and 1976).
21 I do not claim, however, an exhaustive knowledge of the literature on
the subject. The efforts I have seen focus on the chain of ends and
means and, try to evaluate performance at different implementation
levels. See, for example: Practical Concepts, Inc. (1980).
31 A third source of deviations would be the control of projects and
programs, which can be appraised in terms of speed and success of
reactions to deviations from targets.
41 See Tinbergen (1952 and 1956).

A. The Tinbergen Model of Economy Policy
In this model economic variables are classified in four groups
according to data, objectives, instruments and irrelevants. The data
variables (vi) are those exogenous to the model. The objective variables
(y1) are those considered by the authority as the best to improve general
welfare. The instrument variables (zi) are those whose values can be
determined by management. The irrelevant variables (xi) are all other
economic variables.
Economic models consist of structural relations which include
variables of the various types mentioned. These relations are classified
in demand, supply, technical, and definitional equations. Their number
depends on the disaggregation level of the model. Under certain
conditions, relations can be treated as linear.
The Complete Form
The general form of a set of relations ist
J         K         L          M
[1]   E aijxj + E bikyk + E cilzl + E dis vm - 
jul       k-l       1-1        m-l
wheres
iul,...,r - number of structural relations,
J3I,...,J - number of irrelevant variables,
k-l,...,R - number of objective variables,
- number of instrument variables,
mml,...,M (MrJ) - nuiAber of data variables,
aij - coefficients of irrelevant variables,
bik - coefficients of objective variables,
cil = coefficients of instrument variables and,
dim - coefficients of data variables.
In matrix form:
(2]    A    x  +       y     C    a  +  D    v  - O,
(IxJ)(Jzl) (IxK)(Kxl) (IxL)(Lxl) (Ix)(Hxl) (Ixl)
where A, B, C, and D are the matrices of coefficients of irrelevant,
objective, instrument, and data variables, respectively, and x, y, a and v
are vectors representing irrelevant, objective, instrument, and data
variables, respectively. 0 is a zero vector.
For the model to be determined exactly, the number of equations
should be equal to the number of variables that are unknowns in the problem
posed; that is, irrelevant and objective variabless
[31 I-J+IR



_ 163 -
For the authority, the "economic policy problem' is to set the
obiectives it pursues and to manage the instruments, as indicated by the
model. to achieve those obiectives. Since the authority sets the values
(goals) of the objective variables, they become known by definition --
exogenous (together with the data); and since it has to find the values
(targets) of the instruments variables that comply with the former, they
become unknown by definition -- eadogenous (together with the irrelevant).
Again, for the problem to have a uniaue solution, the number of
equations should be equal to the number of unknowns; in this case, to equal
the number of irrelevant and instrument variables:
141 I-J+L.
Then, fron (31 and (41,
(5 KuL.
The number of instruments must be ecual to the number of
obiectives. If there are more objectives than instruments (K>L), there are
more equations than unknowns; the model is overdeterminated; and there is
no solution to the problem except by chance. If there are more instruments
than objectives (L>K), there are more unknowns than equations; the model is
undetermined, there are infinite solutions to the problem.
With the unknowns defined as the irrelevant and instrument
variables, the model becomes:
[63 Ax  + C a - - D v - I y.
To solve this linear system directly, vectors x and z could be
united in a new vector,
of order [(J+L)xlJ - (Ixl). Then,
I s I

and where:
[81  1s ] -- P1 (D v + B 7), |P| t 0.
The management of this matrix could be very complex if its order is high.
The Reduced Form
To avoid such complexity, it is possible to arrive at a reduced form, in
which the irrelevant variables are eliminated, by use of the matriz
partition method. Matrix A of order (IWJ) is partitioned into two
submatricest Ahi of order (JxJ), square, and h2 of order (LxJ). The rest
of matrices 3, C, and D, as well as vector v, are also partitioned in J
rows to obtain:

[93  12 [         1 2 ]         C2 [     + t D3 D4 ] [v2- 0,
where the orders are:

Solving (1Oal for x, since JAil t 0, and replacing it in (lOb) allows the

where I(JxJ) is the identity matrix to obtain the values of the irrelevant
variables.
B. An Estimation of an Ex Post Tinberten Model
The equation system z represents a consistent projection of the
economy, which provides ex ante values for each of the variables, including
the paramters (matriz coefficients). Ex post, once the period of the
projection has ended, other values of the variables, excluding the
parameters, are 'observed,' but the new set of matrix coefficients is not
observed. In fact, there are many sets of matrix coefficients which,
together with the observed values of the variables, conform to an equation
system representirg a consistent 'realisation' -- as opposed to projection
-- of the economys
t14]  A' x  + B y0 + C'Os0 e  DO vO,
where Ak, B', CO, and DI are mattices of coefficient' of irrelevant,
objective, instrument and data variables that satisfy equation (14] --
unknown -- and x0, 70, s0 and v0 are the 'observe4' vataes of vectors
representing irrelevant, objective, instrument, and data variables,
respectively.
The equation system [141 has I equation and I(2L + J + M) unknowns
-- the elements of matrices Al, 3', C' and D'. For it to be exactly
determined, I(2L + J + M-1), additional restrictions are required. The
question is whether there is a set of additional restrictions that makes
'economic sense.' I think there is. The rationale is the following. The
mere fact that the model includes not only identities but also behavioral
equations implies 0me faith in the explanatory (or forecasting) value of
the latter and consequently, in the stability (or predictability) of their
parameters.51
5/ For instance, the model y E x + z, *here y = unknown, s,z O exogenous,
is replaced by the model y p x + z, x - a z, where a is a parameter and
if the value of s is determined better as a function of a than
exogenously. This implies some confidence in the stability or
predictability of parameter a. In fact, making these decisions is what
model building is about.



- 166 -
So, a 'reasonable' assumption -- in the absence of any other
information -- is that the elements of the new (parameter) matrices A', I',
C', and D' should differ as little as possible from the elements of the old
(parameter) matrices A, 3, C and D, respectively. Thus, a set of addi-
tional restrictions is needed that selects among the [I(2L+J+M -1)*(1/4)]
matrices of parameters that satisfy the equation system t14], the set of
four matrices that minimize some weighted (increasing) function of the
elements of dA, dl, dC, and dD.
Such a function should at least comply with the following
conditions:
(a)   to be invariant to the selection of units in which the variables
-- and parameters -- are measured;
(b)   to penalize larger rather than smaller relative changes in the
value of each of the parameters; and
(c)   to be neutral as to the Importance of the changes in the values of
each parameter.
The first condition is met by using relative changes, (that is daijlais).
Condition (b) is usually taken care of by working with the square of tie
relative changes (dai /aij)2. Finally, condition (c) is that the sum to be
minimized should weig equally all of its elements, Ej Ei wij (daij/aij)2;
Iw   (i-l,,..,I  jl,.*J)
The problem, then, is to minimize the functions
[15] Z - Ej Ei (daij)2/1aij)2 + Ek Ei (dbik)2/Ibik)2 +
+ l1 Ei (dcil) /(cil)2 + Em Ei (ddim) /(dim)
subject to:
(16]  A' zO + DI yO + C   O + DIw  =O.
Consequently, the Lagrangian function is:
[l1] Lu 1 EJ3E (13j -. ej)2  .1    E8  - bik - bik)2
2         (1J)2      2            (b;k)2

2         (cl)      2 
- U(A' :0, S, yC' CO * *' IO),
and the set of conditions for the values of the variables to be stationary:
El$3  ii   a - t *Ii   +@ X30 a o, which ar IxJ,;

EL 
a   I's *  0 * blik yk + etl I   *1 + d'i; V = 0, which are xl.
As seen above, EI(2L+J+M-l)) additional restrictions were
required.  The new conditions imposed by the minimization were  I(2L +3J+A)l,
but it also Introduced I new variables (the rs). Thus, the system is
exactly determined.6/
nt In economic models some of the coefficients of the variables are defined
to be zero (when there is no relation between the variables) or unity
(in accounting identities). In such cases, the function to minimize
becomes:
a a xi El        tor a11 *oij    e and  j # 1, ....
subject to j E1 a'ij xj   0, and to the additional conditions:
a'ij - aij for all aij - 0 and aij  - 1.
--The number of these additional conditions is equal to the number of
abandoned conditions for stationary values of the Lagrangian function:
."0 , forall 0rij    n rij a 1.
Thus, the model remains exactly determined. It is also possible to
introduce additional restrictions to parameter values; that is, to bound
s' between 0 and unity. These restrictions rule out solutions that
include outliers.

C. The Differences Between the Ex Post and Ex Ante Estimations
The Complete Form
The differences between the ex ante and the ex Post estimations of
a complete form Tinbergen model are obtained by deducting (2) from (14]:
[211    A'l z  - A x I B' y - B y + C' z - C a I D' v - D v - 0.
The differences between the goals set for the objective variables
and their ex post values, yo - y, are the deviations from the program or
project objectives. The aim of this paper is to explain their origins;
that is, to assign them to different causes. In order to do so, it is
necessary to solve equation system [211 for yo - y. It is possible to
arrive at the following expressions
[221    3' dy - - [A' m + B y + c' z + D' vO + dB y],
but dy - y - y can only be solved if B-3 exists. For it to exist, B has
to be squared, or I-K. But then, from [31 or t41, we know that J-0. That
is, there should be no irrelevant variables, and this happens only In the
reduced form. The irrelevant variables are irrelevant indeed!9/
The Reduced Form
The reduced-form Tinbergen model, equation system [11], can be
solved for the objective variabless
[231    y-F1 g - Fp  s z IFI # O0/

Then, the deviations of the values of the objectives variables from program
of project goals can be expressed as follows:
(25]    et - dy - RI 1v    - R vl + S' v2 - S v2 + T' z - T z,
wheres
et - *total deviations' of observed from programmed values of the
objective variables.
a*, 8', and T' are the ex post matrices of coefficients of
objective instrument and data variables in the reduced form, and YO, zo
v1, and v20 are the *observed' values of the vectors representing
objective, instrument, and data variables, respectively.
D. Causes of Deviations from Program Goals: Classification and Estimation
of Effects
The right-hand side of equation [25] can be decomposed into
different *causes, of the left-hand side *total deviations' from program
goals as followsllI
(26]    et - (' v1 -    vl) + (S' v2 - S v2) + (T ' - T x)3
- R (v1 - vl) + (R' - R) vl + (R' - U) (wI0 - vl) +
+ S (v20 - v2) + (S' - S) v2 + (S' - S) (v20 - v2) +
+ T (zO - z) + (T' - T) a + (T' - T) (  -

126bJ ell I   S (v20 - v2), deviations due to errors (type II) of

[26c) eIII - T (z0 - a), deviations due to errors (type III) of prediction
(or estimation) of instruments variables a;
(26d4  eIV   = (R' - R) vl, deviations due to errors (type IV) of prediction
(or estimation) of the parameters (effects) of data variables
vi;
llJ While system 1221 cannot be solved for dY, a decomposition of its
right-hand side can give insights as to the effects of deviations in
the values of the original parameters (coefficient matrices A, B, C,
and D).



-171-
(26ee  eV     ( (S' - S) v2, deviations due to errors (type V) of prediction
(or estlmation) of the parameters (effects) of data variables

126f) eVI   - (T' - T) a, deviations due to errors (type VI) of prediction
(or estimation) of the parameters (effects) of instrument

(26g) eVII  - (t' - O)(v10 - vl), deviations due to the interaction of
errors of type I and IV (type VII);
[26hl eVnl - (S' - S)(v20 - v2), deviations due to the interaction of
errors of type II and V (type VIII); and
[261i  eIX   - (T' - T)(zO - a), deviations due to the interaction of errors
type III and VI (type IX).
Thus, the deviations of observed values from programmed values of
the objectives can originate In nine different types of error. The values
of the deviations caused by each type of error are known, since V10, v2
and zu are observed, and since I', S' and T  are functions of Al, Bs, C',
and D' determined in [20] from variables whose values are known or
observed.
S. Apvlication of the Methodolo&y to the DIF-Bank Approach
Kahn and othersl2l have modeled an integration of the World Bank
and the IHF's analytical approaches to adjustment and growth -- which are
policy oriented. Thus, their Fund-Bank model is both relevant and suitable
for the application of the methodology for quantitative ex post evaluations
just explained. I have introduced only minor adjustments, to make it
exactly determined instead of undetermined.
The changes are the followings Kahn's equation 1221 was changed
to [22a]; this export equation was totally modified, to make exports
endogenous: and a public savings equation was introduced. Finally, some
excess irrelevants were transformed into objectives (denoted by an
asterisk).
The Comglete Form
The resulting complete model has 14 equations and 36 variables
(including 13 parameters), of which 17 are data (including 13 parameters)
and five are objectives; the remaining unknowns are 14 (nine irrelevants,
five instruments), the same as the number of equations:131

values of the 13 parameters ex post, minimizing the sum of the squares of
the relative changes with respect to the values of the parameters ex ante.
The parameters ares P'-1, r', dP'p, dF'5, B', P'S, f'; c', v', Pal, b',

F. Application of the Methodology to the Chilean SAP, 1985-87
The Chilean SAP is a good case for application of the Fund-Bank
model and the methodology proposed for quantitative ex post evaluations.
The application has only demonstrative purposes; due to limited time,
resources, and data availability, it was necessary to adopt assumptions
such that an Interpretation of the results for the purposes of drawing
policy or performance conclusions is not warranted.
The Model
Some changes have been introduced in the model according to the
particular behavior of the parameters in the Chilean economy. The

The Data
The values of the parameters and data used are shown in Table
TA.1. Parameters r, a, v, dFP, dFR9 a, b, c, and f were estimated from
data for years 1979 through 1085, while Py and P. were taken from the
documents presented by Chile's Government to the Bank when negotiating SAL
I in 1985. For 1986 and 1987, r and a were assumed to be constant.
In Table TA.2 the objectives set for the period under analysis can
be observed. With this information and that of Table TA.1, the results of
the model ore obtained, as seen in Table TA.3.
Table TA.4 has the observed values of irrelevant, data, objective,
and instrument variables. On these basis, the values of the parameters in
Table TA.5 are estimated, which satisfy the observed values of the
variables as shown in Table TA.4.



- 189 -
Then, Table TA.6 presents a disaggregation of the deviations that
occurred in the objectives.  Given the model design, there are only four
data types; consequently, there are no errors of types II, V, and VIII.
For each objective there are 27 different explanations of the deviation
between the observed value and the programed value (goal). The deviations
due to each of these causes can have different signs and large values, and
the total deviation a smaller value. The total deviation in an objeftive
due to a given type of error is assigned to different data, or instruments.
The Results
In 1986, in dY* -- see elII in Table TA.6 -- lower-than-expected
fiscal consumption, Cg, and credits to the private sector dD., not totally
compensated by higher-than-programmed public investment, explain why the
program stopped short of its goal. Instead, errors in instrument
parameters underestimated real GDP growth, thus leading to a lesser total
overestimteLon of dY*.
Public savings, A,*, exceeded its goal, mostly due to a larger
than expected public invesiment, dKg. Positive outweighed negative partial
errors in the case of change in domestic prices, 4PD*, the principal cause
being the smaller than expected credit to the private sector, dDp. With
respect to net international reserves, dR*. its observed value was also
larger than the predetermined, and again the credit to the private sector,
dDp, explains the largest share of the total deviation. But in this case
the influence of errors in data parameters was also important, notably that
of the lagged exchange rate, e_.11, which tended to underestimate the level.
Finally, in the case of X*, implementation errors hindered export
performance (again dDO), while errors in instrument parameters
underestimated X*. The net effect of the two factors was small
overcompliance.
In sumary, in 1986 observed values were above projected values,
with great influence from a dDp smaller than expected.  For 1987, the
observed dY* was larger than projected, due to implementation errors,
compensated by Type-VI errors. Here the largest influence is from d4%. In
Ag*. errors in data parameters -- notably in that of e-1 -- underestimated
the value and outweighed implementation -- especially in dDs -- errors in
the opposite direction. The observed dPD* value exceeded expectations,
mainly due to implementation errors (dD).
The parameter dR* fell below its planned value. The total
deviation is distributed, with the largest influence due to data parameter
and implementation errors. Among them, the most important are e-1; dDp,
and dDg, respectively; also, in the parameter of de, error of type VI was
important.  There is a great difference in Xv (the observed value far
superior), mainly due to implementation errors (the largest weight is of
dDp) and to errors of type VI. In 1987, errors were more significant than
in 1986 -- in accordance with expectations, since projections were based in
1985 figures. Again there is an important weight of implementation errors
and also of data parameters. The most influential variables were dDp and
e-2, respectively.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     There were three consecutive Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs) to
Chile, each the equivalent of US$250 million. SALs I and III were dis-
bursed in two equal tranches; SAL II was disbursed in tranches of $150.0
million and $100.0 million. respectively. The first SAL (Loan 2625-CH) was
sipned on October 25, 1985, SAL II (Loan 2767-CH) on November 21, 1986, and
SAL III (Loan 2892-CH) on December 16, 1987. The second tranche of SAL
III, which is the last disbursement in this cycle of SALs, was largely
disbursed on December 22, 1988.
1.02     The three SALs supported the Government's structural ad4ustment
program that began in 1985. The SAL program concentrated on four areas of
economic policy: export incentives and management of the balance of pay-
ments; savings generation and investment; rehabilitation and development of
the financial system; and improvement of the pension program and health
care system.
Ii.  BMZGINCE OF STRUCTURAL PRO1SMS
1.03     The stage for Chile's economic crisis was set in the late seven-
ties and early eighties, before the country experienced major terms of
trade and international interest rate shocks. A combination of domestic
economic policies and external shocks interrupted the structural adjustment
process and economic growth that were initiated in the mid-seventies.
1.04     These strmctural adjustments of the mid-seventies aimed at
increasing economic efficiency, and included the improved international
integration of the economy, the promotion of private initiative as the
State played a diminishing role in the economy, and the use of market
forces for the allocation of resources. The above efforts resulted in the
growth of exports and the economy, the reduction of the public sector
external debt, and the improvement in public finances. However, these
accomplishments were accompanied by a high rate of unemployment. Further-
more, policies implemented particularly during the 1979-81 period resulted
in the creation of a macroeconomic disequilibrium.
1.05     Chile's opening of its capital account, which started gradually in
1978, was completed by April 1980. This, in conjunction with the fixing of
the exchange rate in June 1979 and the full indexation of wages to past
inflation, led to massive inflows of unguaranteed long-term credit. These
capital flows financed an unsustainable expansion of private consumption
and investment in 1980 and early 1981. The Chilean boom of that period was
fundamentally financed with foreign credit. As a consequence, external
debt rose from US$6.7 billion at end-1978, to US$17.2 billion by end-1982,
or the equivalent of 69 percent of GDP. More than 100 percent of the
increase in debt during this period was contracted by the private sector,
since government net foreign liabilities declined continuously from 1975 to
1981.
1.06     At the same time, the competitiveness of the country's tradeable
sector was being eroded by the fixed exchange rate that was instituted in
June 1979. Furthermore, the corporate sector was generally weakened by
excessive real domestic interest rates, whicl; exceeded 30 percent per year



- 194 -
at their peak in the late seventies. Finally, the financial sector was
affected by the deterioration in the quality of their loans. This was due
to two main causess the general problems of the corporate sector, and the
granting of credits to companies the ownership of which was related to that
of the lending institutions. This generalized practice undermined the
stability and the public confidence in the financial system.
III.  SEX CRISIS AND TE FIRST ADJUSTulT BFVORTSs  1982-05
1.07     At the end of 1981 the Chilean economy was burdened by high
foreign debt, a weak corporate sector, and a crippled financial system.
Domestic imbalances, which led to the slowdown of the economy in early
1981, were aggravated by the deteriorating external environment. Steep oil
price increases followed by falling copper prices, surging real interest
rates and subsequent deep international recession battered the economy.
Between 1979 and 1983, Chile's terms of trade fell 26.5 percent, among the
severest losses for any Latin American economy.
1.08     The sharp curtailment of capital flows in early 1982, which tran-
spired even before the generalized debt crisis, amplified the problem and
led the economy to the depression of 1982-83. In 1982 alone, real CDP
declined by 14.1 percent, and open unemployment rose to over 23 percent.
The collapse in domestic demand led to the decline in Imports from US$6.5
billion to US$3.6 billion, while the current account deficit contracted by
US$2.4 billion, or over 10 percent of the GDP.
1.09     Substantial uncertainty prevailed in the country from mid-1982 to
the first quarter of 1983. Various exchange rate regimes were tried in
that short period of time (fixed, free float, crawling peg), and several
finance ministers held that position in rapid succession.
1.10     During the rest of 1983, the Government continued with its austere
policies, reflecting the 'Stand-by' program agreed with the IF, without
however adopting adjustment policies of a structural nature. In 1983,
Chile's trade surplus reached US$l billion, with imports continuing their
decline to less than half their 1981 levels. In that year, after providing
state guarantees to the private financial sector's external debt, Chile was
able to restructure its debts and secure additional resources from
international banks. Despite the deterioration in the international
environment, Chile was in full compliance with its IMF 'Stand-by' program.
1.11     On the domestic front, the most pressing issues during 1983 and
1984 were the need to reduce high and rising rates of unemployment and
strengthen the private financial and corporate sectors, which confronted a
severe financial crisis. Toward the first of these goals, the Government
devoted significant resources to the development of special employment
programs and increased public investment in infrastructure and housing.
Towards the second. a major part of the financial sector was intervened in
January 1983: all major banks and two corporate groups. In order to
strengthen the recovery of the financial system, the Government established
a preferential exchange rate to serve dollar debts, and rescheduled debts
in 1983 and 1984 for viable companies and financial institutions at con-
cessionary terms. In addition, in 1984, the Central Bank, in order to
strengthen the banking system, purchased bad loan portfolios from banks
which agreed to repurchase them with future profits.



- 195 -
1.12     Public finances deteriorated markedly after 1981, owing to a num-
ber of factors. Quantitatively, the most important was the social security
reform of mid-1981. The transfer of many workers from the State pay-as-
you-go system to the private capitalization scheme implied a big fiscal
burden to the Government. On the other hand, public revenues were badly
hurt by the 1982-83 depression and, in 1984, by expansionist fiscal pol-
icies. The consolidated nonfinancial public sector deficit in 1984 reached
4.3 percent of GDP, as compared to the yearly surpluses generated between
1976 and 1981.
1.13     Between April and September 1984, a new finance minister attempted
to reactivate the economy by stimulating aggregate demand. As a con-
sequence, the economy grew that year by 6.3 percent, but the current
account deficit almost doubled. It became increasingly clear through that
year that the expansion was unsustainable and that the economy lacked a
coherent long-term economic plan. It also became clear that in order to
generate the resources for a satisfactory economic growth, the Chilean
economy required a profound structural adjustment.  Thus, in February 1985,
with a new finance minister at the helm, and with the assistance of the
World Bank, the Government proceeded to prepare a structuril adjustment
program for the three year period of 1985-87. The program attempted to
strengthen the structural adjustment strategy that was initiated in the
mid-seventies.
IV. SAL I
A. The AdJustment Pro8rm
1.14     The structural adjustment program of 1985 had as an objective the
recovery of economic activity and employment, while gradually reducing the
external debt burden. This program attempted to achieve these objectives
through the implementation of policies directed at resolving three priority
structural problems facing the economy: insufficient growth and excessive
concentration of exports; low levels of savings and investment; and the
precarious situation of the financial system.
1.15     More specifically, the adjustment program attempted to expand
nontraditional exports through the uniform reduction of tariffs, the estab-
lishment of a stable and realistic exchange rate policy, the creation of a
mnchanism to smooth the fluctuations of copper prices (the Copper Stabil-
ization Fund), the more expeditious refund of the value-added tax (VAT) to
exporters, the refund of indirect taxes to small exporters, the study of
forest industries towards the promotion of this sector, and the strengthen-
ing of PROCRILE, a public institution commissioned to assist exporters, by
providing more direct support to small and medium exporters (the latter
received funding from a Technical Assistance Loan (2504-CH) signed in April
1985).
1.16     On savings and investment, since the private financial and non-
financial sectors faced serious financial difficulties, it was understood
that the major source of an increase in savings, at that stage, should be
the public sector. Therefore, the adjustment program called for austerity
in current fiscal expeaditures, emphasizing the increase in employment over



- 196 -
wages, and the pricing of public services that would reflect the opportun-
ity cost of resources devoted to them. Furthermore, the public sector
sought to improve the return on its investments, with resources scheduled
to flow principally to copper and energy, and undertook additional infra-
structure investments to reduce bottlenecks affecting private investment.
1.17     As far as the rescue of the financial system was concerned, the
substantial transfer of public resources already required by the various
rescue operations prompted the Government to halt additional subsidies to
the banking system, and reduce, to the extent possible, existing subsidy
programs. Furthermore, they halted further subsidized reschedulings of
debt, strengthened financial and corporate legislation regarding market
concentration and quality of assets, and created legislation allowing the
State to assist in the recapitalization of intervened banks.
S. IuPlemeutation and Results
1.18     The Chilean Government complied satisfactorily with the content
and timing of the prescribed policy actions, which are described in detail
in Annex 2.
1.19     Regarding the balance of payments, during 1985, the Government
reduced its uniform import tariff from 35 percent to 20 percent, and depre-
ciated the peso versus the US dollar by 25 percent, to its lowest level in
ten years. In 1986, the depreciation of the US dollar against other cur-
rencies led to a further 7 percent real depreciation of the peso. In addi-
tion to the peso's depreciation, the Government implemented a series of
tax, banking, administrative and fiscal measures as export incentives.
1.20     To ensure that future upward movements of volatile copper prices
would not result in a real appreciation of the peso, a pilot Copper Stabil-
ization Fund was created on January 1, 1986.  It acted as a mechaniem to
ensure, through budget adjustments, that part of CODELCO's copper revenues
from higher than budgeted copper prices would be sterilized in a reserve
fund.  The funds deposited would, in turn, be utilized partly to smooth out
copper revenue shortfalls if the copper price were lower than budgeted.
Because of low international copper prices, no deposits were made in the
Copper Stabilization Fund during SAL 1.
1.21     The above adjustments created a favorable environment for private
investment in new export activities and efficient import substitution lead-
ing to a moderate growth-with-adjustment result, with 1985 GDP growing by
2.4 percent. Noncopper exports grew at a real rate of 9 percent; imports
declined by 12 percent, although imports of capital goods rose by 10.6 per-
cent. Chile's trade surplus increased sharply to US$790 million. a sub-
stantial rise from the US$290 million of 1984. For the 1985-86 period,
despite a 10 percent deterioration in Chile's terms of trade, the trade
surplus almost quadrupled, rising to US$1.1 billion. Lower-than-expected
international interest rates and the repricing obtained through external
debt negotiations complemented Chile's trade effort. The current account
deficit was reduced from USS2 billion in 1984 to US$1.1 billion in 1986 as
programmed.



- 197 -
1.22     Prudent management of Chile's external debt shaped the performance
of its capital account. The first SAL, the IMF's EFF, and the partial IBRD
guarantee of a US$300 million B-Loan opened the way for a favorable agree-
ment with the commercial banks on the 1985-86 financial package. Chile and
its creditors agreed to restructure US$5.7 billion of maturities due in
1985-87, and the banks provided US$1.1 billion of new money for 1985-86.
This debt management strategy was complemented by one of the region's first
and most innovative debt conversion programs, exchanging discounted foreign
debt for equity and domestic liabilities.
1.23     Gross domestic savings increased by nearly one-half in the adjust-
ment period--from 12.6 percent of GDP in 1984 to 18.4 percent in 1986.
National savings rose to #.7 percent of GDP in 1986, up from 2.6 percent in
1984. As anticipated, public savings led this effort. Private savings
continued to hover around 3 percent, dipping to 1.3 percent in 1985, but
rebounding to 3.3 percent in 1986.
1.24     A conservative fiscal policy markedly improved public finances.
The Government increased collections by 1.2 percent of GDP between 1984 and
1986, through improvements in administration of the value-added tax. It
made a sustained effort to restrain expenditures by holding increases in
salaries and pensions at or below the rate of inflation; the fall in open
unemployment permitted lower transfer payments for emergency employment
programs; the Government also cut other subsidies, mainly affecting the
middle class. Operational surpluses of the public enterprises also con-
tributed to the increase in public savings; they were three percentage
points higher as a share of GDP in 1986 than in 1984. Finally, lower
foreign and domestic interest rates helped keep expenditures down. Public
savings increased from 0.5 percent of GDP in 1984 to 4.4 percent in 1986.
1.25     Total investment as a share of GDP continued to hover around
14 percent in 1984-86 after strong recovery from the depression nadir of
9.8 percent in 1983. Public sector investment rose to 7.6 percent of GDP
in 1986, up from 6.4 percent in 1984. A Bank evaluation in December 1986
found public investment to be generally consistent with the adjustment
program. Private fixed investment grew by more than 10 percent annually in
1985 and 1986. However, overall rates of investment still lagged those
recorded in the mid-seventies; gross private domestic investment as a share
of GDP averaged about 8.3 percent of GDP in 1975-79, compared to about
7 percent in 1985-86.
1.26     Regarding the corporate and financial sector program, to reduce
the losses that the Central Bank incurred in the 1983-84 rescue operations
(para. 11), and return credibility to the banking system, the Central Bank
gradually phased out by end-1986 the preferential exchange rate for all-
but-small debtors, and the dollar swap and deposit subsidies by early 1987.
These policies reduced the operational deficit of the Central Bank to
3.2 percent of GDP in 1986.
1.27     In mid-1985, the Government began a recapitalization program for
the two major intervened banks, the Banco de Chile and Banco de Santiago.
Additionally, all domestic banks were permitted to restructure the liabil-
ities of heavily indebted domestic productive companies, and, in some
cases, to capitalize debts. By end-1986, the restructuring program was



- 198 -
terminated. These efforts helped improve the loan portfolio of the finan-
cial system. By end-1986, 82 percent of the financial system's portfolio
held the two highest classification ratings, compared to 63 percent two
years before, largely as a consequence of the Central Bank's purchase of
bad loans. Recapitalization and reprogramming measures allowed the finan-
cial system to make an overall profit in 1985 for the first time since 1982
and to renew lending to viable firms. Net profits of the financial system
rose slightly in 1986.
V. SAL UI
1.28     During 1985, the Chilean economy started building the foundations
for sustained growth, on the basis of higher, more diversified exports,
improved internal savings, and reduced dependence on external financiog.
In view of the initial success of the adjustment program and the need to
strengthen such foundations, early in 1986, the Chilean Government
requested from the World Bank a second SAL.
1.29     At that stage, the Country was still not able to cover even half
of its interest payments with domestically generated resources.  Savings
levels were still lower than necessary to finance a strong investment
effort, and investment was insufficient to support a targeted long-term GDP
growth rate of about 5 percent per year. Real wages and per capita incomes
were well below their 1981 peaks and the social costs of the crisis were
significant. In view of the above, the World Bank agreed to continue sup-
porting the adjustment program with an additional loan.
A. The Adjustment Program
1.30     On November 21, 1986, the World Bank signed SAL II with Chile.
Once again, the value of the loan was for US$250 million, to be disbursed
in two tranches. In this second phase, the priorities of the program were
to accelerate the reprivatization and recapitalization of the banking and
corporate sectors, increase the rate of public savings to 4.4 percent of
GDP, promote an austere and efficient public sector investment program, and
strengthen the economy's export incentives and social programs.
1.31     More specifically, the adjustment program aimed inter alia at
improving the efficiency and safety of the financial markets. Measures
taken in that direction includedt the recapitalization of the private
nonfinancial sector through the case-by-case renegotiation of debts that
had a chance of being repaid; the recapitalization of the banking system;
and the reprivatization of intervened banks. Furthermore, the adjttstment
program introduced a new Banking Law that aimed to strengthen the super-
visory and legal framework required for the sound functioning of Chile's
banking system.
1.32     As for attaining the target for public sector savings, the program
envisaged the continuation of the austere current expenditure program that
was initiated in 1985, in vhich employment growth took priority over wage
increases. Furthermore, the program sought improvements in the efficiency
of public sector investments, both by following through with large scale
projects in copper and energy, and medium-sized infrastructure projects
that aided in the development of export and import substituting regions.



- 199 -
1.33     In order to strengthen export incentives, the program sought to:
maintain a stable and realistic exchange rate policy; continue with the
Copper Stabilization Fund; amplify bank credit margins to exporters; study
more specifically the investment requirements of the forestry sector; and
continue to enhance the support PROCHILE provided to medium and small non-
traditional exporters.
1.34     Finally, in view of the need to target more efficiently social
expenditures, the adjustment program included the decentralization of
administration of the main social programs. Furthermore, it sought to
increase the financial resources for the national public health system by
increasing the compulsory health contribution. This action was comple-
mented by financial and administrative changes to improve the use of cur-
rent health facilities.
X. luplementation and Results
1.35     The Chilean Government complied satisfactorily with the content
and timing of the prescribed policy actions, which are described in detail
in Annex 3.
1.36     Regarding the balance of payments, during 1986 and 1987, the Gov-
ernment kept its uniform tariff rate at 20 percent. The peso continued to
depreciate progressively, by the difference between domestic and inter-
national inflation. However, the depreciation of the US dollar against
other currencies led to the real effective depreciation of the peso by
15.5 percent in 1986, and an additional 7.4 percent in 1987.
1.37     The stable trade regime created a favorable environment for
private investment in new export activities and efficient import substitu-
tion. Noncopper exports were 22.4 percent higher in 1987 than the year
before which, together with higher copper prices, resulted in an increase
in overall export revenues in 1987 of 24.4 percent. In view of the better-
than-anticipated noncopper export performance both in 1986 and 1987, it was
agreed not to modify the export incentive framework. Imports increased by
29 percent as imports of capital goods, indicating a growth in investment,
expanded by 35 percent. Despite the substantial growth in imports, Chile's
trade surplus increased to US$1,229 million in 1987, a substantial rise
from the US$302 million in 1984.
1.38     The Government maintained its Stabilization Fund for copper
revenues.  However, as was the case in SAL I, during SAL II international
copper prices remained below those activating the Fund and, consequently,
no deposits were made in it.
1.39     Lower international interest rates complemented Chile's trade
efforts. The current account deficit was reduced from US$2 billion in 1984
to US$809 million in 1987. However, with no new disbursements from its
commercial creditors, Chile's net international reserves at end-1987 stood
at US$1.9 billion, indicating a loss of US$124 million over the year.
Nevertheless, international reserves covered 5.5 months of imports.



- 200-
1.40     The continuous involvement of multilateral organizations in Chile
facilitated the February 1987 agreement between the Government and its
commercial creditors on vays to fund the 1987-88 financial gap. The agree-
ment became effective in June 1987. It consolidated interest payments into
an annual payment, which deferred the July 1988 payment of about US$450
million to January 1989. In addition, maturities in 1988-91 were resched-
uled on a serial basis. Also current spreads on past new money facilities
(1983, 1984, 1985 and the cofinancing agreement) were reduced to 1-118
percent over LIBOR, while those on restructured maturities (1983-91) were
reduced to 1 percent, producing savings of US$65 million in 1987-88.
Together with the reschedulings agreed with creditor governments, these
measures were expected to close the 1987-88 financial gap.
1.41     Improvement in public finances made an important contribution to
the balance of payments and recovery. The overall fiscal deficit declined
from 4.4 percent of GDP in 1984 to 0.6 percent in 1987. Revenues benefited
from the increase in copper prices and higher tax collections (particularly
international trade). Public savings in 1987 increased to 5.3 percents
improvement came largely as a consequence of restraint in current expendi-
tures, which grew at a real 1.1 percent, reflecting low cost-of-living
adjustments for salaries and pensions, lower transfer payments for unem-
ployment and related subsidies, and the lower level of international
interest rates.
1.42     The decrease of the public sector deficit was consistent with the
further growth in public sector investment which rose to 7.3 percent of GDP
in 1987, up from 6.4 percent in 1984. The concurrent increase in private
investment, contributed to the growth of overall investment from 13.7 per-
cent of GDP in 1985, to 14.6 percent in 1986, and 16.9 percent in 1987.
1.43     The Government's public sector investment program for 1986 was
reviewed with the Bank during an economic mission to Chile in December
1986, and the mission concurred with the project priorities of the Govern-
ment. Public sector investment that year amounted to 7.5 percent of GDP,
in close accord with the Government's original forecast.
1.44     The program to recapitalize the banking system was initiated in
1984 and consisted of the following main measuress ti) recapitalizing of
the five intervened banks; (ii) requiring shareholders of other weakened
banks to subscribe new capital; (iii) permitting the sale of bad portfolio
to the Central Bank up to a limit of 3.5 times the subscription of new
capital as required by the Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institu-
tions; (iv) eliminating deficiencies in provisions; and (v) provisioning
adequately for loan losses, investments, and real repossessed collateral.
Items (i), (ii) and (iii) were completed by December 1986. Provision defi-
ciencies were eliminated by the end of 1986, except for provisions against
losses from earlier periods which were not made up fully by the Banco de
Chile until the end of March 1987. Thus, by early 1987, the recapitaliza-
tion of the banking system was essentially complete.
1.45     Another fundamental target of the program was the elimination of
the various public subsidies to private debtors. This target was nearly
totally met by December 1986, with the phasing out of the preferential
exchange rate for debtors of over US$50,000. Dollar swap and deposit sub-



- 201 -
sidies were phased out in early 1987. Generalized reprogramings at sub-
sidized rates had ended a year earlier, as were the generous credit lines
to the banking sector.
1.46     Sy late 1986. short-term solvency had been mostly secured in the
financial and corporate sectors. The financial sector, for example, showed
an overall profit in 1985 (for the first time since 1982) and improved its
performance in 1986. Recapitalization of the corporate sector also pro-
ceeded at a rapid pace, in the face of incentives for case-by-case finan-
cial workouts between private debtors and their commercial creditors.
During 1986, operationally viable firms generated sufficient profits to
service their financial payments; by December 1986, most of them had
reached satisfactory financial workout arrangements that had strengthened
their overall debt-equity ratio.
1.47     During SAL II, attention focused on the recapitalization of the
banking and corporate sectors to assure their long-term solvency, the re-
privatization of several intervened banks and nonfinancial companies, and
the provision of a better regulatory and legal framework for the banking
system. Those actions marked a clear shift from short-term crisis manage-
ment to addressing economic issues relevant to the long-tetm growth of the
economy.
1.48     In the first stage of the program, supported by SAL I, social
programs centered on the generation of jobs and the provision of emergency
employment programs for the needy. Principally as a result of the economic
recovery, workers in the emergency employment programs were reduced from
500,000 in 1983 to less than 200,000 in August 1986. Nevertheless,
declines in public spending on health and education deteriorated the infra-
structure, equipment and wages in these sectors. For example, public
sector health expenditures declined 18 percent in real terms between 1981
and 1986.
1.49     During SAL II, an effort was made to reduce these shortcomings.
The compulsory health contribution from salaries was increased from 6 to
7 percent, an effort was made to improve the productivity and efficiency of
current health facilities and the emergency employment programs. In order
to improve the targeting of expenditures and decentralize the administra-
tion of major social programs, the Government proceeded with the munici-
palization of schools. While at the time of the second tranche release of
SAL II, it was too early to evaluate the effectiveness of school municipal-
ization, it became clear that the increase of the health tax on salaries
was not sufficient to finance the needed improvements in infrastructure and
equipment expenditures in the health sector.
1.50     There were some difficulties with the execution of studies agreed
upon under SAL 1I. The Government was to have undertaken four studies.
Two studies, on employment and health, were satisfactorily completed, albe-
it with some delay. The Government did not undertake the studies of the
impact on domestic savings of pension funds, and public enterprise effici-
ency. On the study of the impact on domestic savings, after some consider-
ation, the Government decided, in consultation with the Bank, that other
issues were of greater concern, namely the restrictions on interme. ion
of the pension funds in long-term markets. Therefore, the latter study was
comissioned under SAL III.



- 202 -
3.51     The study of public enterprise efficiency, financed under a Tech-
nical Assistance Loan (IBRD Loan No. 2504-CH), was also slow to get under-
way as the Government concentrated its efforts on privatization. Although
a consulting firm was selected in May 1986, contract negotiations were
significantly delayed as the Chilean agencies involved realized that the
rapid progress on privatization had changed the issues highlighted in the
original terms of reference. The selected firm eventually withdrew. This
led to a major change in the terms of reference for the study based on new
proposals advanced by the Ministry of the Economy, charged with administer-
ing the TAL.  However, the Ministry of Finance did not approve the
study--which would have focused on a management information system report-
ing to the Economy Ministry--on grounds that it would not be cost-
effective, since an information system reporting to CORI0 was already well-
established. Given this apparent stalemate, the Bank felt it improvident
to press the issue for purposes of the structural adjustment program.
VI. SAL II
1.52     During 1986, the Chilean economy continued its progress. on the
basis of sustained growth in production and employment, the improvement of
external accounts, and the relative decline in external indebtedness. With
the successful completion of the second SAL, at the beginning of 1987, the
Chilean Government requested from the World Bank a third SAL, in order to
consolidate the advances made, and strengthen the adjustment process in
other areas, like the social sectors.
A. The Adjustment Prosram
1.53     On December 16, 1987, the World Bank signed SAL III with Chile.
The value of this loan, as was the case with the previous two, was for
US$250 million, to be disbursed in two tranches. However, while in the
previous two SALs the second tranche release was scheduled seven months
after the first tranche, in SAL III, the second tranche release was sched-
uled for twelve months later to provide time for the Government to enact
the needed reforms, especially in the social security and health sectors.
1.54     The program focused again on the promotion of exports, investment,
and savings, and the completion of the financial sector's rehabilitation.
Additionally, it placed particular emphasis on the social sectors, to
ensure that efforts toward structural adjustment would continue to be
accompanied by constant improvements in living conditions, particularly for
the poorest segments of society.
1.55     As far as exports are concerned, the adjustment program continued
emphasizing the need to retain a favorable macroeconomic environment and
continue with the reduction of disincentives imbedded in the tariff
structure. More specifically, the program endorsed the maintenance of
uniform and low tariffs, the continuation and strengthening of the Copper
Stabilization Fund, and the adoption of tariff offsets to encourage
exports, particularly those from medium- and small-sized firms.



- 203 -
1.56     On public expenditures and investment, the program incorporated
the increase in the contribution of the public sector to domestic savings
from 4.8 to 5 percent of GDP, sought improved social returns to public
investment (limiting expenditures on oil refining, new highway construction
in the south, railroad subsidies and middle-class housing, while increasing
resources for health), and the maintenance of overall public sector per-
formance consistent with sustainable growth.
1.57     Jointly with the increase in public savings and investment, the
adjustment program sought to enhance private savings and investment.
Towards that goal, the program sought the creation of a stable macro-
economic environment, and a tax system with the least possible disincen-
tives. Furthermore, and for the same reason, the program sought to
strengthen the capital markets and ensure a sound, competitive banking
sector. Measures for that purpose included plans to create a private and
more flexible system of risk classification, the encouragement of firms to
develop into open corporations, the regulation of institutional investment,
the monitoring of banks' collection procedures of the portfolio sold to the
Central Bank, and the preparation of studies that sought means to strength-
en both sectors.
1.58     As far as the pension system was concerned. the adjustment program
sought to enhance the security and diversification of investment by private
pension funds, enhance their members' sense of idenitity with the institu-
tions, increase the long-term coverage of the system, reduce costs and
increase the competitiveness of pension funds.
1.59     Finally, on the health sector, the program sought to consolidate
the gains of past health investments in maternal and infant care and to
improve the cost-effective prevention strategy to early detection of
specific chronic and debilitating diseases. The program also sought to
improve efficiency in the use of human and financial resources allocated to
health services, of the private health care delivery system, and of health
investment by the public sector.
S. Implementation and Results
1.60     The Chilean Government complied satisfactorily with the content
and timing of the prescribed policy actions, which are described in detail
in Annex 4.
1.61     Regarding the balance of Da1ments, the Government maintaitned the
structure of export incentives, the value of the real effective exchange
rate, and a uniform tariff policy. In January 1988. the Government lowered
ad valorem tariffs from 20 percent to 15 percent. The real effective
exchange rate in September 1988 was unchanged from the rate prevailing in
November 1987, when SAL III negotiations took place. Thus, between
November 1987 and September 1988 the real effective exchange rate preserved
the 40 percent depreciation that materialized between 1980 and 1987.
1.62     During 1988, the above measures contributed to the increase in
export volume by 6.1 percent over 1987. Noncopper export volume increased
by 11.7 percent. Compounded by the strong improvement in the terms of
trade, the overall growth in exports contributed to the increase of the



- 204 -
merchandise trade surplus from US$1,229 million in 1987, to US$2,219
million in 1988, i.e., an increase of 80 percent. The strong trade per-
formance negated any need to alter the existing incentive framework for
exports, although a few distortions against indirect exporters were cor-
rected.
1.63     The strong trade performance contributed to the increase in gross
international reserves from US$1.9 billion in December 1987, to US$2.5
billion in December 1988. These reserves included those in the Copper
Stabilization Fund, which was maintained and strengthened during 1988,
reaching US$354 million. These efforts were complemented by the Govern-
ment's debt conversion program, which during 1988 reduced Chile's external
debt by US$2.9 billion, bringing the cumulative reduction in debt over a
four year period to US$6.2 billion.
1.64     The good trade performance in 1988 contributed to meeting Chile's
external financing requirements for that year. Likewise, available finan-
cing from vultilateral organizations and coomercial banks were assessed to
adequately cover Chile*s external financing requirements for 1989 and 1990.
1.65     The adjustment program was also successful in increasing savings
and investment. Nonfinancial public sector savings in 1988 reached
5.2 percent of GDP, despite the decrease in June of the value-added tax
from 20 percent to 16 percent, and in January of import tariffs from 20
percent to 15 percent. Furthermore, public savings do not reflect those
generated by the public enterprises that were privatized during the year,
nor the deposits in the Copper Stabilization Fund. The latter alone
accounted in 1988 for 2.5 percent of the GDP. Public sector savings,
jointly with the transfer of public sector savings to the private sector,
contributed significantly in the increase in national savings to 15.4 per-
cent of the GDP, from 12.6 percent in 1987. Fixed capital formation in
1988 increased by a real 10.7 percent, raising its share to GDP from 16
percent in 1987, to 16.3 percent in 1988.
1.66     The banking sector has undergone significant restructuring, fol-
lowing the financial crisis of 1982-83. In 1988, the acceleration of eco-
nomic growth facilitated the increase in savings, investment, and financial
intermediation. Thus, evidence points to the continuous recovery of the
banking sector. Banks' operational surplus continued to increase in 1988,
accelerating the repurchase of their bad loan portfolios sold to the
Central Bank. The improved operational performance took place despite
increased competition from financial companies and institutional investors
in a number of financial markets which banks have traditionally dominated.
At the same time, banks have been attempting to enter into new financial
markets. In spite of the improved situation of the banking sector. it will
take a number of years for various banks, including the largest two (Chile
and Santiago), to repurchase their bad loans from the Central Bank.
1.67     In contrast to the experience of the 1976-81 growth period, the
current economic recovery has been accompanied by a significant increase in
bonds and stock transactions. The development of the capital markets has
been facilitated by the reform of the social security system, which created
a significant body of institutional investors, the privatization of state
enterprises via the capital markets, and the supply of a large stock of
Central Bank and Treasury bonds, issued in 1983-86. The increasing import-



- 205 -
ance of pension funds and life insurance companies as institutional invest-
ors is the main characteristic of Chile's financial system. Further expan-
sion of the capital markets depends on the incentives for private companies
to issue new bonds and stocks.
1.68     The emphasis on social sectors was, once more, enhanced in the
conditionality of SAL III. Health, housing and social security were the
fundamental concerns in this stage. Reversing a declining trend since
1904, the proportion of active contributors over registered insured in the
pension system increased from 70.4 percent in 1986, to 72.4 percent in
1987.  This improvement was mostly the result of better overall economic
conditions and control measures. Likewise, the decline in open unemploy-
ment contributed to the increase in the percentage of the labor force
covered by the pension system in June 1988 to 79.2 percent. Another devel-
opment was the greater flexibility of pension firms to invest in financial
instruments issued by private nonfinancial corporations, resulting in the
decline of the share of pension funds invested in government paper from
44.9 percent in 1987 to 40.1 percent in June 1988. Furthermore, pension
funds conducted an educational campaign to increase the knowledge of the
insured about the system and its benefits, and statements to the insured
became more transparent: However, there were delays in simplifying and
unifying the collection of social security contributions. Nevertheless,
the Bank, upon evaluating progress made, appreciated the complexities
involved in this process and concluded that delays in the implementation of
this component were justified.
1.69     A review of activities during the past year in the area of chronic
diseases and adult health showed that efforts were made to standardize
norms for diagnosis and treatment, appoint program coordinators, organize
workshops for communication, training or study purposes, and develop pro-
grams that were intended to reduce the disease and death burden caused by
chronic and debilitating diseases. On maternal and child care, during
1988, 135 primary health care facilities were transferred to municipal-
ities. This municipalization program, which is now completed, is intended
to improve the quantity and quality of primary health care, both through
the availability of additional resources to such facilities and easier
access to them. The Government's actual investment expenditures during
1988 for repair and replacement of biomedical equipment and the rehabilita-
tion and replacement of deteriorating medical buildings was double the
amount budgeted. Emergency employment programs were essentially phased out
as the reviving economy generated adequate employment on its own.
1.70     At the time of supervision of the second tranche release, the
Government, despite the presentation of a draft law to the Legislature. was
unable to secure passage of a law taxing cigarette advertising. On
November 1988, the Government committed itself to reintroduce such a law,
which is expected to be presented as part of the omnibus Budget Law, in
October or November of 1989.
1.71     There were various studies commissioned under SAL III.  Three
studies on the financial sector system were completed satisfactorily, on
time.   The Government also completed a study relating to the social secur-
ity system. However, during supervision of the second tranche release, the
Government agreed to expand the existing study on the efficacy of including
the self-employed in the pension system, in order to incorporate the



- 206 -
results of a survey among the self-employed centering on the causes of
their lack of participation in the pension system. Completion of this
study was delayed, and the new completion date is for June 1989. The
Government also agreed to complete a study that will evaluate the effect of
voluntary supplementary savings accounts at the private pension fund com-
panies, on overall savings, the costs to these companies, and the enhance-
ment of their members' sense of indentity. This study was also delayed for
completion, and the new date is for June 1989. Another study that was
delayed, until June l9e9, was on the social costs of cigarette smoking.
VIZ. THE RELEVANCE OF TIM STRUCTURAL ADJUSIEUT LOANS FOR TE
CHILEA  SwCOOm
1.72     The three SALs supported a coherent and long-term adjustment pro-
gram that the Government initiated in early 1985. Although the program had
already been launched at the time of the first loan agreement, the SAL
conditionality helped strengthen policy measures in key areas. There was a
substantial coincidence of economic objectives between the World Bank and
the Chilean Government, and fundamental agreement in the three main objec-
tives of the program: the promotion of noncopper exports;'the enhancement
of domestic savings; and the strengthening of the corporate and financial
sectors. Beyond those objectives, SALs II and III influenced the Govern-
ment's focus on social programs, and the policies designed to mobilize the
private savings of the pension funds for productive investment.
1.73     Regarding the promotion of noncopper exports, the World Bank
influenced the implementation of the Copper Stabilization Fund. This is an
important tool with which to stabilize aggregate demand and the real
exchange rate.
1.74     The Bank also played an important role in the definition of the
public investment program. After a careful review of this program, several
projects were affected. In addition to indefinite postponement of the
expansion of Con-Con's oil refinery and scaling down of the southern high-
way and the northern railroads, the construction of the third line of
Santiago's metro and a port in Easter Island were eliminated in an earlier
period, and investments in the copper sector were increased. In general,
SALs encouraged a more careful evaluation of public investment programs.
1.75     While the Bank shared the goal of strengthening the corporate and
financial sectors, it also conveyed its concerns on the costs of various
support programs, and played an important role in phasing out the preferen-
tial exchange rate program, and in terminating generalized subsidies in
debt reprogrammings. The Bank also had an input in the strengthening of
the legal and regulatory framework of the financial sector and, in particu-
lar, the provision of a partial deposit insurance.
1.76     On the social sectors, the Bank influenced health policies,
including increased expenditures in this sector, contributed to the con-
tinued improvement in targeting of housing subsidies, and the recovery of
the Government's mortgage portfolio. Policy adjustments in the social
security system to promote efficiency, protect the security of the funds,
increase its coverage and improve its fairness also received an important
input from the Bank.



- 207 -
1.77     The above impact of SALs on various economic sectors was amplified
by their impact on the overall economy, either through direct financing or
by facilitating other forms of external financing. For an economy carrying
the heavy external debt burden that Chile does, financing 6 percent to
8 percent of the Country's annual import bill, as the SALs did in 1986 and
1987, had significant consequences for the well-being of the entire
economy. Additionally. the SALs and the IMF's Extended Fund Facility (EFF)
to Chile served as catalysts for other sources of financing.
1.78     Jointly, the World Bank and the IMF programs were decisive in
facilitating new loans from commercial bank creditors. The World Bank and
the IMF worked closely with the Chilean Government in the 1985 debt renego-
tiations with foreign banks, joining Government officials in major inter-
national financial centers to express support for Chile's financial
package. Chile restructured US$5.7 billion of principal payments to com-
mercial banks falling due during 1985-87, and obtained US$1.1 billion in
new money for 1985-86. In that package, the Bank partially guaranteed a
US$300 million B-loan to Chile. In July 1985, eight creditor governments
also agreed to reschedule US$145 million, representing 65 percent of prin-
cipal payments due during July 1. 1985-December 31, 1986 on Chilean public
or publicly-guaranteed debt with an original maturity of more than one
year.
1.79     In February 1987, the Government reached another agreement with
its commercial creditors. This agreement consolidated interest payments
into an annual payment, which deferred the July 1988 payment of US$450
million to January 1989. In addition, maturities in 1988-91 were re-
scheduled, and spreads on past new money facilities were .reduced to 1-118
percent over LIBOR, while those on restructured maturities were reduced to
1 percent. This agreement, which aimed at closing Chile's 1987-88
financing gap, was facilitated by the Bank's agreement to reduce the
guarantee fee for the US$300 B-Loan of which the Bank guaranteed
US$150,000.
1.80     In April 1988, Chile and its Commercial Bank Advisory Committee
reached an agreement further to reduce the spread of their outstanding
loans. The banks agreed to accept a price of LIBOR plus 13/16ths for old
debt and 7/8ths for the new money facilities. They also agreed that up to
US$2 billion in debt of Chilean entities may be exchanged for debt held by
any creditor, and that the Government may use the lesser of US$500 million
or the reserves accumulated in the Copper Stabilization Fund as collateral
for the above exchanges or debt buybacks, that Chile can grant liens on its
assets of uip to US$500 million as collateral for future new borrowings, and
that Chile can pledge up to US$150 million as collateral security for hedg-
ing transactions. Again, to facilitate this agreement, the Bank accepted
the use of the Copper Stabilization Fund deposits for the purposes
described above, and reduced once more its guarantee fee for its B-Loan to
Chile.
1.81     The release of the second tranche for SAL III also paved the way
for a US$200 million equivalent cofinancing loan from the Export-Import
Bank of Japan (EXIM Bank). The cofinancing loan was signed on December 14,
1988 and was disbursed jointly with the second tranche of SAL III. The
Bank played a crucial role in this cofinancing operation having twice in



- 208 -
1988 accompanied EXIM Bank missions to Chile to assist them in their
appraisal of economic conditions in the country. Furthermore, the EXIM
Bank relied on the Bank's assessment of conditionality for disbursing its
loan to Chile. It was made clear that the Chilean Government would not
have accepted additional conditionality from another government and, con-
sequently, the role played by the Bank in facilitating this loan was essen-
tial in obtaining the Japanese cofinancing.
1.82     The above contributions of the SAL program helped create an
environment of macroeconomic stability which was crucial to the recovery of
private investment from the lows reached in the 1982-83 debacle. Without
the SALs and the IMF's EFF program, Chile would have been faced with a
tough choice. The absence of such programs would not only have deprived
Chile of a very significant source of financing, but would have made
unlikely any additional money and concessions originating from comiercial
banks. Under such circumstances, Chile might have been forced to suspend
foreign interest payments andlor reduce its economic growth. In either
case, already depressed living conditions would have suffered further.
Instead, the Bank's program contributed to a successful case of macro-
economic adjustment in Latin America, where a heavily indebted nation has
been able not only to service its external debt, but resume a satisfactory
pace of economic expansion.
VIII. THE ROLS OF TUB IF
1.83     In January 1983, in the midst of Chile's economic crisis, the IMP
entered into a two year Stand-by arrangement with Chile, for SDR 500 mil-
lion. That program basically focused on the reduction of public sector
expenditures, in the absence of any structural changes in the economy.
Subsequently, in August 15, 1985, the IMF provided support to the Govern-
ment's structural adjustment program with a three year (1985-87) Extended
Fund Facility (EFF) providing SDR 750 million. The principal objective of
the EFF was to reduce by half, and in the period of three-years, the 1984
current account deficit, within the context of moderate economic growth and
decreasing inflation. Towards that goal, the EFF established quantitative
limits on the expansion of net domestic assets of the Central Bank, inter-
national reserves and the fiscal deficit as a share to GDP.
1.84     At the beginning of 1986, after Chile had met all EFF targets
established in 1983, the IMF decided to continue its support of the Govern-
ment's adjustment program. The principal objective at this stage was to
reduce subsidies to the banking sector and the consolidated deficit of the
public sector. This was in'addition to ongoing reduction of the current
account deficit and the pursuit. of low inflation and moderate economic
growth. To that effect, the EFF established new quantitative targets for
1986.
1.85     A similar process was developed in 1987, following Chile's compli-
ance with all EFF targets for 1986. The last disbursement from the three-
year EFF took place in August 1988. At mid-year 1988, the Chilean Govern-
ment requested continued Fund support for their economic program through a
one-year lengthening of the current EFF arrangement. The IM assessed that
the macroeconomic and structural policies followed by the Government would
contribute to the attainment of the objectives of their program and decided



- 209 -
to support the Government's request. The fourth year extension of the EFF
(to August 1989), provided an additional SDR75 million to Chile. New per-
formance criteria were set, along the lines of previous conditions.
1.86     The Bank and the IMF established an excellent working relationship
in the SALIEFF-supported adjustment program, with frequent consultation
between institutions in each critical phase of these respective operations.
U.  PROCIRD3?T AND DISBURSEKHIT
1.87     The proceeds of each of the three loans were disbursed in two
tranchess US$125 million upon effectiveness (US$150 million for SAL II)
and the remaining US$125 million (US$100 million for SAL II) after satis-
factory reviews of progress on the overall program of structural adjustment
and the criteria for second tranche disbursement were met. Full disburse-
nent of SAL I and SAL II took place in a period of less than nine months
after approval; the second tranche release for SAL III was completed within
a year of approval.
1.88     Disbursements for these operations were authorizes on the basis of
import documentation presented through statement of expenditures (SOgs).
The imports permitted were governed by a negative list cited in Schedule 1
of the loan agreements. The Central Bank was responsible for preparation
of the withdrawal applications and for collection and retention of evidence
in support of these applications. The applications, which were based on
import documentation developed by commercial banks, were prepared in a
skilled and orderly fashion. The only problems, related to misunderstand-
ings about dates of imports that could qualify for second tranche with-
drawals, were minor and adequately clarified. Supervision missions by
regional and loan department staff verified that the required documentation
was retained and in easily accessible and good order.
1.89     Procurement for all three operations proceeded well.  Interna-
tional competitive bidding (ICB) was not used because all purchases were
for goods costing less than $5 million each, or for petroleum products,
which, as specified in the Loan Agreements, do not require ICB. There is
no information on the breakdown of public and private procurement. How-
ever, the Central Bank has indicated that, in its view, the majority of
contracts were awarded through the private sector, utilizing commercial
practices. Although documentation is not available, given the open market
policy pursued in Chile, it is assumed that most of these importers used
the normal commercial practice of obtaining competitive quotations.
1.90    The lank reviewed the documentation provided by the Central Bank
supporting the SOEs as part of supervision. These field reviews, performed
in relation to tranche releases for SAL I and SAL 1I, confirmed that proper
procurement procedures were adhered to and that imports were not from the
negative list. Based on the performance of SAL I and SAL II, the Bank
relied on the audit reports to monitor procurement performance for SAL III.
(As detailed in the following paragraph, these audit reports concluded that
the goods imported under SAL III complied with the restrictions provided in
the loan agreement.) In addition, a sample of SOS documentation used for
tranche release for SAL III will be reviewed ex post by a Bank mission
scheduled for late June 1989.



- 210 -
1.91     The audit reports were prepared in a timely fashion by a reputable
private firm (Langton Clarke) and were considered satisfactory when
reviewed by LAC audit specialists. (In fact, in the opinion of one LAC
audit specialist, the reports provide a good reference for future audits of
structural adjustment operations in other countries.) The reports, which
detail all import documentation reviewed on site at commercial banks in
Chile, with specific information on suppliers, commodity and amount of
contract, concluded that:
(a) goods imported comply with the restrictions of t4e loan agree-
ments:
(b) SOEs prepared by the Central Bank are in compliance and fairly
present the import disbursements for goods provided in the
loan agreement; and
(c) Central Bank documentation showed no difference with that
reported to the Bank.

CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE
Santiaao                                           SAL I
FIRST STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN: BACKGROUND TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM
I.        Period Preceding the Program
1.        The sudden change in the external economic climate at the beginning
of the 1980s gave rise to a crisis that dealt a severe blow to the economies
in this region. For the Chilean economy in particular, it brought to an
abrupt although temporary halt the structural adjustment and growth process
initiated in the mid-70s to increase the efficiency of the economy through
greater integration into the international trading system, the development or
private initiative, a subsidiary role for the state in the economy, and
preferential use of the market for the allocation of resources. Despite
efforts to foster exports, reduce external indebtedness in the public sector
and put public finances on a sounder footing, the heavy debt commitments of
the private sector, coupled with a drastic deterioration of the terms if trade
and a sharp rise in international interest rates in 1981, caused cons;_erable
macroeconomic imbalances. which began to worsen in 1982 as a result of the
dramatic drop in private financing flows to the region.
2.        In response to these pressures, an energetic program was instituted
to adjust domestic expenditure and bring it into line with the real
possibilities of financing then available. This made an increase in the real
exchange rate inevitable, which, since it affected loan recoverability
seriously, led to government intervention in the management of a sizeable
group of financial institutions. As a consequence of the program, there was a
sharp drop in aggregate expenditure, reflected in a smaller current account
deficit, which fell from US$4.733 billion in 1981 to US$1.117 billion in
1983. In combination with the weakened capital position of the banking
system, however, this caused a drastic reduction in levels of activity,
employment and real wages.
3.        Throughout 1983 and 1984, Chile pursued its macroeconomic policy
against the background of a stand-by arrangement with the IWF designed
basically to promote the required adjustment in expenditure in the absence of
a structural change. Concurrently, after the Government had agreed to
guarantee the private financial sector's external credits, the outstanding
debt was renegotiated and a commitment obtained from the tnbernational banking
system to provide additional resources so that the costs of the adjustment
process could be spread over time. The goals embodied in this program were
accomplished in full, despite the subsequent unexpected deterioration in
external conditions. Its results were positive, much of the improvement
observed in the country's external accounts being explained by a successful
combination of exchange, monetary and fiscal policy.

4.        On the domestic front, the major concerns in 1983 and 1984 were to
reduce the high and Prowing unemployment rates observed from mid-1982 onward
and to strengthen the financial and nonfinancial segments of the private
sector, which.Xere confronted with a grave liquidity erisis. The
authorities therefore allocated a considerable volume of resources at this
stage to funding special temporary employment programs and substantially
increased government spending on housing and infrastructure. In addition,
in the process of returning the financial system to a healthier footing,
debtors with foreign-currency commitments were allowed a preferential
exchange rate and in both 1983 and 1984 the obligations of viable debtors in
this group were rescheduled so as to cushion the impact of the crisis on
Chile's industries and financial institutions. Furthermore, in order to
solve the financial problem created by the nonrecoverability of a proportion
of the loans made by those institutions, a mechanism was set up in 1984
through which their outstanding portfolios were purchased, with arrangements
for repurchase subsequently.
5.        In mid-1984, on the basis of assumptions regarding future external
conditions that proved ultimately to have been optimistic, projections were
made of the external savings requirements needed to finance a program of
sustained growth over the three years from 1984 to 1986. Following the
realization that they would be considerable, a conviction arose that
far-reaching adjustment of the structural type was becoming unavoidable. An
additional and unexpected deterioration in the terms of trade and an
increase in international interest rates - reversals that at least
partially explained the substantial current account deficit in 1984 -- made
the urgency of the need for such a change all the more apparent.
Accordingly, in February 1985, with World Bank assistance, an adjustment
program for the three-year period 1985-87 was drawn up in an attempt to
reinforce the basic structural transformation strategy initiated in the
mid-70s.
II.       Scope of the Proaram
Government obiectives
6.        The structural adjustment program set up in early 1985 was
designed essentially to reconcile a recovery in activity and employment
levels with a gradual reduction in the external debt burden. A realistic
exchange rate policy, consistent with what the Chilean economy could afford
to expend over the medium term, was adopted as a means of stimulating
increased growth in nontraditional exports while simultaneously fostering
the development of those secte's engaged in efficient import substitution.
In the absence of margins that lould make higher domestic savings possible
by reducing consumption, the program aimed not only at paving the way for
increased savings in the public sector through a policy of austerity in
current expenditure, but also at stimulating private savings through
progressive normalization and revitalization of the capital market against a
background of positive real interest rates. Tn brief, then, the central
objective of this adjustment program was export-based growth, coupled with a
more intensive domestic savings effort that would reduce the dependence on
external financing.



ANNEX 5

Priorities
?.        In the initial stages, given the overall objective just described,
the adjustment-program was used as the vehicle for implementing a package of
measures intended to solve three priority structural problems confronting the
economy: insufficient growth and excessive concentration in exports, an
imbalance between savings and investment, and the precarious situation of the
financial system. There was also equal concern to increase the capacity of
the economy to generate productive employment, although the authorities
recognized that substantial improvements in this area would occur only
gradually.
8.        In particular, the adjustment program attempted to expand
nontraditional exports, mainly by: setting a timetable for uniform tariff
reductions, so as to bring down the cost of imported inputs used in the
manufacture of export goods; instituting a realistic and stable exchange
policy, so as to increase the competitiveness of Chilean exports; creating a
mechanism to neutralize fluctuations in copper prices (the Copper
Stabilization Fund), so as to eliminate one cause of exchange instability;
making reimbursement of the value-added tax payable by exporters on their
imported inputs quicker and more flexible; creating a simplified system for
the refund of indirect taxes on minor exports; conducting preliminary studies
for and drawing up a forestry program, so as to facilitate adequate planning
of the public and private investment requirements that would guarantee rapid
growth in this sector; and, finally, restructuring PROCHILE to provide more
direct support for small and medium exporters of nontraditional goods - for
example, by organizing new markets and by identifying potential export
products.
9.        Since the financial and nonfinancial segments of the private sector
were facing serious liquidity problems, the major savings effort, at least at
this initial stage of the program, needed to come from the public sector.
Accordingly, the adjustment program attempted to raise the public-sector
savings rate not only by following a policy of accountability and austerity on
currer- expenditure, under which the creation of more job opportunities would
take precedence over wage increases that were not sustainable over the
medium-term, but also by introducing a policy of fixing rate scales for public
services to reflect changes in their opportunity costs and at the same time
help at least partially to finance the related necessary capital spending.
10.       The adjustment program also aimed at raising the returns on
government capital spending by: executing projects in the copper and energy
sectors, to promote exports directly; developing infrastructure, to eliminate
the bottlenecks affecting the growth of private investment in the
agricultural, forestry and industrial export sectors; and, finally,
re-examining projects already approved and pending, with a view to
reallocating the resources earmarked for those not in line with development
strategy priorities.
11.       Finally, considering the substantial transfers of public funds
needed to finance previous - and future - recovery operations, and given the
importance of achieving less dependence on external financing, the adjustment
program, at least during this first stage, attempted to help solve the
liquidity crisis by: instituting a monetary policy that would preclude



ANNEX 5

- 223 -
additional subsidies for the banking system and phase out existing subsidies
as far as possible; putting a stop to further general debt reschedulings;
strengthening financial and corporate legislation governing the concentration
and quality of-assets; and, finally, enacting legislation that would enable
the state to assist in recapitalizing the banking institutions in whose
management it had intervened.
Role of the IMF. the World Bank and other sources of financing
12.       The IMF supported Chile's structural adjustment program with an
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of SDR 750 million for the period 1985-87. Its
key objective was to bring down the current account deficit recorded in 1984
by half over the three-year period, in a climate of moderate economic growth
and declining inflation. To that end, the EFF program began with the
introduction of specific quantitative limits for 1985 on growth in the net
domestic assets of the Central Bank, international reserves and the fiscal
deficit as a proportion of GDP.
13.       Paralleling this, the World Bank in October 1985 officially approved
a US$250 million structural adjustment loan (SAL I) for 1985-86. Intended to
support the measures to be implemented in 1985 and the first half of 1986, it
was disbursed in two equal tranches, the first being payable on signature of
the loan itself (December 1985) and the second subject to compliance with
certain pre-established conditions (June 1986).
14.       According to official projections, after allowing for IMF credits of
US$508 million, additional external financing requirements to cover the
1985-86 balance of payments deficit would amount to US$1.995 billion. The
support Chile received from the World Bank and the IMF in its 1985-86 external
debt negotiations with the international banking community was crucial not
only in obtaining that financing but also in rescheduling the commitments that
matured during the 1985-86 period. These funds came principally from the
World Sank, in the form of disbursements amounting to US$400 million under SAL
programs, and from the international financial community, in the form of fresh
funds amounting to US$1.085 billion (a figure that included US$300 million in
cofinancing arrangements between the World Bank and the international banking
system).
III.      Program Achievements
Policy implementation
15.       During the first half of 1985, as proof of their determination to
promote the required structural adjustment from the outset, the Chilean
authorities instituted the key measures designed to provide the necessary
incentives for development of the export sector and efficient import
substitution. In addition, an early start was also made with important
actions aimed at bringing about both an increase in public savings rates and
recapitalization and normalization of the fjnancial system.
16.       In view of the restriction on financing confronting the Chilean
economy, and since the achievement of significant and lasting results in this
area meant that the country must persevere with these policies through the
medium term, evidence of fulfillment of the requirements of the initial



ANNEX S
Page 5 of 36
- 224 -
program agreed on with the World Bank was of vital importance. This was the
case because integral implementation of the specific measures agreed to as
conditions for disbursement of the second tranche of SAL I - as detailed in
the accompanying Table I - would alone give access to the additional similar
financial support arrangements needed to fund continuation of the 1985-87
adjustment program.
Results achieved
17.       In 1985, as a result of implementation of the policies described,
the key objectives of the adjustment program were satisfactorily
accomplished. In addition to a drastic cutback in the level if domestic
expenditure, there was moderate but sustained growth in export-based activity,
coupled with a greater domestic savings effort. As proof of the substantial
contraction in aggregate expenditure over the period, the current account
deficit fell by 351 with respect to the 1984 figure, a result ascribable to
fewer imports and - although to a lesser degree - increased exports (refer
to Table 2). With regard to the latter, it should be noted that without the
significant decline (13.9S) in the prices of noncopper exports, the surprising
increase (14.62) in the volume of those exports would have meant a drop of
over 401 in the current account deficit (refer to Table 3).
18.       In addition, the extent of Chile's dependence on external financing
was also reduced significantly in 1985: with virtually identical investment
rates, gross national savings rose from 32 of GDP in 1984 to 5.42 of GDP in
1985. As demonstrated by the change in the public-sector savings rate over
the same period, namely an increase from 0.6% of GDP to 3.812of GDP, the major
effort in this arena - at least in the initial stage of the program - took
place in the government sector. A decisive element here was the real
improvement achieved in the deficit of the nonfinancial public sector, which
was brought down from 4.41 of GDP in 1984 to 2.61 of GDP in 1985 (refer to
Table 4).
19.       There was also substantial improvement in the equity situation of
banks and debtors in 1985, a basic prerequisite if private-sector savings
levels were to increase over the medium term. The introduction in mid-1985 of
novel mechanisms of external debt conversion undoubtedly favored this
improvement, since they changed the liability structure and capitalization of
banks and corporations. Some of these mechanisms also helped raise levels of
investment (funded with external resources) and employment from late 1985
onward.  Consolidation of the advances achieved in connection with both
external and domestic accounts began in 1986.
Projected and actual performance
20.       In 1985, macroeconomic indicators behaved largely in accordance with
the official projections made at mid-year. 1/ The balance of payments current
account deficit, for instance, was slightly below the projected level, the
result of an overestimate of payments for financial and nonfinancial services
which more than offset an overestimate of the trade account surplus (refer to
Table 2). As far as the elements which go to make up the latter are
1/ These projections, contained in the June 1985 document "Republic of Chile
Financial Package," were more optimistic in general than those put out by
the World Bank in October 1985 in its Report No. P-4131-CE.



ANNEX S

concerned, there was an overestimate of noncopper exports, but examination of
the key assumptions set out in Table 3 indicates the explanation, namely a
sharp and unexpected fall in the prices of the major nontraditional exports,
itself at least partially neutralized by a doubling of the projected rate of
growth in this class of export merchandise. The accuracy of the projections
of copper price and volume of copper exports were similarly affected by the
same kind of trend, except that here the overestimate of price was amply
offset by the underestimate of volume increase. The end result was that
copper exports were slightly higher than projected.
21.       Although level of activity increased significantly, it was
approximately one-third less than projected, mainly as a consequence of the
unforeseen real decline in aggregate consumption over the period (refer to
Table 4). As far as 1986 is concerned, although the level of investment grew
at slightly less than the projected rate, the behavior of aggregate
consumption led to higher than expected growth in activity (5S, according to
Table 4). Despite fully offsetting overestimates of noncopper exports and
imports in the same period, the balance of payments current account deficit
was clearly more positive than predicted (refer to Table 2). This was
fundamentally a result of the substantial and unexpected decline in
international interest rates that began in late 1985 (and totaled between 2
and 3 percentage points by the end of 1986), an improvement that would have
meant a lower current account deficit had the price of copper during the
period not been so significantly overestimated (by approximately 10%,
according to Table 3).

CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE
Santiago                                                      SAL It
sECoND STRUC=URAL ADJUSMENT -WAN: BACKGROUND TO INPLDMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM
I.        8coPe of the Protram
tntroduction
1.        In 1985, as may be seen from the Project Completion Report on
Structural Adjustment Loan No. I, the Chilean economy began to lay a firm
foundation from which to promote export-based growth and a higher domestic
savings rate, and thereby reduce its dependence on external financing. Thus,
the initial stage of the country's structural adjustment program can be
described as successful. In early 1986. in view of its need to make that
foundation firmer still, Chile applied to the World Bank for funding support
in the form of a second structural adjustment leanding operation that would
guarantee the financial viability of the new adjustment phase then beginning.
Priorities
2.        In order to ensure that this second phase would consolidate the
country's ultimate objective, the priorities of the new adjustment program
were:  to progress with the reprivatization and recapitalixation of the
banking and corporate sectors; to raise the public savings rate to 4.4X of
GDP; to promote an efficient austerity-based program of government spending;
and, finally, to strengthen both export incentives and social programs.
3.        In particular, this adjustment program was intended to foster the
development of a safe and efficient capital market by instituting measures
that would facilitate: recapitalization of the nonfinancial private sector,
through case-by-case renegotiation with viable debtors who were experiencing
problems; recapitalization of the banking system; and, finally,
reprivatisation of the banks in whose management the authorities had
intervened. In addition, it was proposed to introduce new banking legislation
that would ensure greater transparency in the management of these institutions
and facilitate the process of supervising them.
4.        The adjustment program ws also designed to enable Chile to reach
its set goal of an increase in public sector savings by reinforcing its policy
of accountability and austerity in current expenditure, initiated in 1985, a
policy more intent on incre. sing employment opportunities than on wage
improvements impossible to be sustained into the medium term. A further
program aim was to continue adding to the efficiency of government capital
spending through large-scale projects in the copper and energy sectors and
medium-scale infrastructure projects that would pave the way for direct
development of export activities and efficient import substitution.
5.        in addition, the program included provisions for strengthening
export incentives by: maintaining a stable and realistic exchange policy;
continuing with the Copper Stabilization Fund program; increasing individual

exporters' bank credit margins; completion and issue of a study on medium- and
long-term investment requirements in the forestry sector; and, finally,
improving the support made available through PROCHILE to small and medium
exporters of nontraditional products.
6.        Finally, given the need to focus social expenditure more
efficiently, the adjustment program called for implementation of a plan to
decentralize administration of the country's key social programs. It also
sought to solve the shortage of financial and infrastructure resources evident
in the health sector by raising wage-earners' obligatory social security
contributions and developing a plan of action for utilizing available hospital
facilities more rationally in the future.
Role of the IMF. the World Dank and other sources of financing
7.        At the beginning of 1986, since the specific quantitative goals set
for 198S under the EFF program had been reached, the IMP decided to contisue
with it so as to support the new phase of structural adjustment that was
beginning. The key EFF'objective for this stage, besides further advances in
reducing the current account deficit against a background of moderate economic
growth and declining inflation, was to implement a monetary policy of avoiding
new subsidies to the banking system and phasing out current ones and to follow
a fiscal policy that would lead to an additional reduction in the consolidated
public-sector deficit. To these ends, as in 1985, the EFF program delineated
a set of specific quantitative limits for 1986.
S.        The World Bank officially approved a further US$250 mdllion
structural adjustment loan (SAL II) for the period 1986-87 in November 1986.
These funds, intended to support the measures introduced in 1986 and the first
half of 1987, were to be disbursed in two tranches - the first, for US$150
million, to be payable immediately on signature of the loan agreement
(November 1986) -  with the second, for US$100 million, to be subject to the
fulfillment of certain pre-established conditions (June 1987). At the same
time. the external debt negotiations referred to in the Project Completion
Report on SAL I made provision for rescheduling commitments that matured in
1987 and repricing the outstanding debt as of January 1, 1987. In addition,
although the arrangements to finance the 1987 balance of payments shortfall
did not include seeking fresh money from the international financial
community, they did include negotiations for a retiming of interest payments,
by changing their frequency from a six-monthly to a twelve-monthly basis, as
of January 1, 1987. Ul

Policy imoletentation
9.        Beginning in mid-1986, on completion of an evaluation period on the
most efficient strategy for ensuring development of a competitive and stable
capital market over the medium term, key measures for a real strengthening in
I/ Because of the delays which affected these negotiations, the retiming
came into effect only as of January 1, ;988, which meant that the Chilean
authorities found it necessary to raise a US$225 million bridge loan with
the Bank for International Settlement in 1987.

the equity position of the banking system were implemented. At the same time,
in order to extend the advances made in 1985 in improving equilibrium in both
external and domestic accounts, the policies focused on raising the public
savings rate ad preserving the competitiveness of sectors producing tradable
goods were reinforced. Proof of the success of these moves is to be seen in
the fact that the program agreed on with the World Bank for this second phase
was implemented in its entirety. As an examination of the accompanying
Table I will show, the conditions agreed on for disbursement of the second
tranche of SAL 1I were complied with fully by April 1987.
Macroeconomic results
10.       As a consequence of implementation of the policies described, the
progress that had been achieved over the course of 1985 with the country's
external and domestic accounts began to take an obviously firm hold in 1986.
Not only was there a further - and, again, significant - adjustment In the
level of domestic expenditure, but economic activity continued to show
moc irate but sustained growth based on exports, with an additional domestic
savings effort. Specifically, the current account deficit was 182 lower than
in 1985, which meant that the goal of bringing aggregate expenditure to
approximately US$1 billion was successfully achieved (refer to Table 2).
11.       In addition, Chile's dependence on external financing continued
falling significantly in 1986: with moderately higher investment rates,
national gross savings rose from 5.4S of GDP to 7.7S. As indicated by the
change in the rate of government savings, which rose from 3.82 of GDP to 4.42
over the same period, the public sector continued to be responsible for a
major part of this additional effort. This contributed decisively once again
to the real improvement observed in the deficit of the nonfinancial public
sector, which fe-1 from 2.6% of GDP in 1985 to 22 in 1986 (refer to Table 4).
Projected and actual performance
12.       In 1986, macroeconomic indicators behaved very much in accordance
with officiil mid-year projections, 2/ repeating the pattern of the preceding
period. The deficit in the balance of payments current account was almost
exactly at the level predicted, despite slight but exactly offsetting
underestimates of payments for financial services and the trade account
surplus (refer to Table 2). As to the elements that determine the latter, it
is to be noted that noncopper export volume was less than predicted, but
examination of the key assumptions listed in Table 3 shows this to have been
due mainly to significant und .estimaticon of the volume growth rates of the
major nontraditional export products. Projections for the other key
assumptions regarding the external sector were fairly accurate.
13.       The growth rate in activity level was underestimated by a L.ittle
over one percentage point, mainly because of unexpected increases in both
investment and exports. Aggregate consumption, however, was projected
accurately. Regarding 1987, while the activity level showed a slightly higher
2/   These projections are to be found in an unpublished document completed by
the Research Department of the Central Bank of Chile on August 6, 1986.
They reflect the base scenario (i.e. "zero") which this document presents.

than estimated growth rate as a result of unrerestimation of consumption
levels, the deficit in the balance of payments current account was clearly
more positive than predicted, a result traceable essentially not only to the
unexpected inqLaee, noted from early 1987 onward, in the price of copper
(which rose by nearly 1002 from December 1986 to December 1987) but also to
underestimation of the rate of growth in the volumes of copper exported; these
improvements would have translated into a considerably reduced current account
deficit bad there not been a significant (approxitmtely 202) underestimate of
Imports during the period, explained mainly by an increase in imports of
capital goods.

Central Bank of Chile
Santiago                                           SAL III
THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN: BACKGROUND TO INPLEMENTATZON
I.        Scope of the Proaram
Backtround
1.        As shown by the report on SAL II, in 1986 Chile's economy continued
to lay the bases for sustained growth in production and employmeat, along with
a gradual improveent in external accounts and a reduction in the relative
weight of the external debt. As such, that second phase of the structural
adjustment program can also be considered successful.
In early 1987, owing to the need to consolidate those bases, the
World Bank was approached for addltional credit in the form of a third SAL
operation to provide a large share of the necessary financing.
Priorities
2.        As indicated, SAL III essentially continued to build on the progress
since 1985 regarding structural adjustment in production and expenditure. The
program also included the introduction of specific policies aimed at
fine-tuning and strengthening the incentives in each of the main areas on
which the previous programs focused - exports, investment and savings.
Lastly, the program placed special emphasis on the social sectors, to ensure
that the adjustment efforts would continue to go hand in hand with a gradual
improvement in the standard of living of the poorest segment of the population.
3.        Thus, for exports, the adjustment program continued to stress the
need to maintain e favorable macroeconomic picture by developing the sectors
with export potential. In tandem, new tax and other measures were promoted to
help neutralize the disincentives arising from customs duties and other
distortions. In brief, the specific policies and measures were: maintenance
of a stable and realistic exchange policy; maintenance of a customs policy
with low and uniform rates; maintenance and Improvement of the Copper
Stabllization Fund; and, lastly, promulgation and/or implementation of various
legal initiatives seeking to improve the drawback system for minor exports,
incorporate "indirect exporters" into the custom rebate system for imported
capital goods and inputs, and establish a partial guarantee fund for small and
medium exporters.
4.        In fiscal policy, the program continued to seek both an increase in
public savings and maintenance of a high rate of investment. Efforts were
made to raise the public savings rate from 4.82 to 52 of GDP before the
pertinent accounting corrections were made when the public enterprises were
privatized and the temporary status of government workers regulated. The
program sought to maintain public investment at 7.51 of GDP, and care was
taken to ensure that it was based on rigorous socioeconomic analysis of
projects.



- 243 -                        Page2 ofx 
5.        Under SAL III, there vas also a need for a set of incentives to
stimulate savings and private investment. Basic tools in this were the
maintenance of a climate of macroeconomic stability and a tax system with the
fewest disinceatives possible for savings and investment. In addition, owing
to its clear Impact on the volume and quality of investment, the program paid
special attention to the institutionality of the capital market. In
particular, SAL III included the full implementation of the provisions of the
recently revised Banking Law with a view to spurring competition in the
capital market; introduction of tax initiatives to aid the development of the
capital market; and, lastly, carrying out of studies and measures oimed at
improving the regulations governing institutional investors such as pension
fund administrators (AFPs, insurance companies and mutual funds.
6.        In forecasting, the adjustment program sought to carry forward a
number of actions centered on improving the new pension system. It also
sought to keep the public better informed about the features of the system nd
examined ways of lowering its operating costs.
7.        Lastly, the adjustment program sought to make bealth expenditurea
more productive by building on progress in maternal and child health;
Improving the strategy for the forecasting and prompt diagnosis of certain
chronic illnesses; making better use of the funds allocated to the national
health system; improving the new private health system (ISAPRRS)9 ad, lastly,
increasing the productivity of certain public investments in the sector,
particularly regarding the maintenance and rehabilitation of equipumnt.
Role of the IMF, World Bank and other sources of financing
8.        In early 1987, following the full achievement of the specific
quantitative targets set for 1986 by the EFF program, the International
Monetary Fund decided to proceed with its disbursements as scheduled, thereby
producing firm support for the new consolidation phase described above. 1I to
that end, as in the preceding two-year period, the program continued to set
limits for 1987 regarding the increase in the net domestic assets of the
Central Bank, international reserves and nonfinancial public sector deficit as
a proportion of GD!.
9.        In addition, financing of the 1987-88 program included funds secured
in the 1987 negotiations with the creditor banks and multilateral and
government lending agencies. Thus, the international banks participated
through retiming of interest payments from a six-monthly base to an annual one
as of January 1, 1988; the repricing of the interest rate as of January 1,
1987, eliminating the prime base determining the rate for "new money" borrowed
by the Central Bank and lowering the LIBOR margins for both now money and
original debt; the refinancing of loans amounting to US$12.486 billion, whicb
meant that all bank credits current in 1983 and new money contracted since
that time would not fall due until 1991; and, lastly, the effectiveness of the
availability of short-term co mercial credit was extended until the end of
1989 for a minimum of US$1.700 billion.
1/   The last EFF disbursement for SDR 750 million which was negotiated for
1985-87 was made in August 1988, when it was increased by SDR 7S million.

10.       The 1987-88 financial package was supplemented with the refinancing
of the commitmenta of the public sector with official agencies (Paris Club)
and the involvement of the World Bank by means of a third structural
adjustment losa pproved in December 1987 for 1987-1988. Its disbursements of
US$250 million were to support the measures implemented between mid-1987 and
the end of 1988 and made in equal installments, the first immediately after
signature (December 1987) and the last subject to fulfillment of certain
pre-established conditions (December 1988). 21
Scope of the Program
Implementation of Policies
11.       During the second half of 1987, as a test of the resolve to promote
the consolidation of the recent progress in structural adjustment, a set of
initiatives aimed at strengthening the export sector, increasing the quality
and quantity of investment and increasing domestic savings was implemented.
At the same time, to continue the progress made in recent years in the social
arena. policies seeking to raise the efficiency of both the new pension and
private health systems as well as health sector funding were strengthened.
Testimony to the foregoing is the full implementation of the program agreed
with the World Bank for this third phase. As can be seen from Table I below,
the specific measures agreed for the disbursement of the second tranche under
the SAL ITI loan were fully implemented by October 1988.
2/   In December 1988 only US$ll2.4 million was disbursed, and the balance of
the original tranche (i.e. US$12.6 million) was disbursed in early 1989.

Macroeconomic results
12.       In 1987. as a result of the policies described, the progress that
had been made .ince 1985 in external and national accounts was consolidated in
large measure, thereby satisfying the main objectives of the third phase of
the adjustment program. In point of fact, together with an additional
adjustment in the level of domestic expenditure, there continued to be a
moderate - but sustained - increase based on exports end a simultaneous rise
in domestic savings. The current account deficit in the balance of payments
was 261 lower than in 1986, following a marked improvement in the trade
balance and lover payments for financial services than originally projected
(see Table 2).
13.       Reliance on external financing continued to decline in 1987. The
rate of investment increased and gross domestic savings rose from 7. 7  to
12.61 of GDP (see Table 4). The rise in public savings in the same period
from 5.51 to 5.81 of GDP meant that a nonnegligable share of the increase was
attributable to the public sector. That increase had a major impact on the
deficit of the nonfinancial public sector, which decreased from 1.71 of GDP in
1986 to 0.25S of GDP in 1987.
14.       Preliminary figures show that in 1988 significant progress was made
in external and national accounts. In particular, while activity expanded by
6.81, a rate of growth that had not been achieved since the beginning of the
decade, the current account deficit was nearly one third of the billion
dollars that had been set as a target in mid-1987. Moreover, these results
were accompanied by an additional reduction in reliance on external financing
since, with a rate of investment equal to that in 1987, gross dpnestic savings
rose from 12.6X to 15S of GDP. That progreFs clearly had a favorable impact
on the prices for the major exports, especially copper. As a result of the
structural adjustment programs previously agreed with the World Bank, a
significant share of the additional income derived from higher copper prices
was accumulated in the Stabilization Fund established for that purpose.
Proiected and actual performance
15.       In 1987 macroeconomic accounts were sounder than officially
projected mid-year. Thus, the current account deficit in the balance of
payments was lower than projected, owing primarily to better performance of
the trade balance than originally expected (Table 2). Regarding the
determinants of the latter, there was a significant underestimating of both
copper and noncopper exports, which far exceeded that for imports. In this
connection, the performance of the key assumptions in Table 3 shows that the
behavior of exports was due to a sharp and unexpected increase in prices for
the major exports, as indicated above, which in turn was supported by a
doubling of the rate of growth projected for noncopper products. Specifically
for copper exports, the underestimating of prices mentioned above reached a
significant 26X, whereas projections on volume were very accurate.
16.       Moreover, in 1987, growth in the level of activity was
underestimated by somewhat more than one-half of a percentage point,
essentially due to an unforeseen -- and significant -- increase in the rate of
investment. The projection regarding aggregate consumption in that year was
very accurate. For 1988, while the level of activity grew significantly



-252                            ANNEX 5
Page 33 of 36
faster than estimated because the increase in consumption was underestimated
(6.1 percentage points), the actual current account deficit was only one third
of the projected level (see Table 2). This was due to a significant
underestimatin$.of exports that more than offset that, albeit also high, for
imports. Regarding the estimates of prices and exportable volumes, these
behaved in essentially the same manner as in 1987, although this time the
underestimating of copper prices was of a much higher magnitude, i.e. 73%.
