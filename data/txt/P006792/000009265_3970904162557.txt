FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                Empresa de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Bogota
Guarantor:               Republic of Colombia
Amount:                  US$129.0  million equivalent
Terms:                   17 years, including five years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate
Project                  The proposed project would continue with the Bank's
Description:           past efforts to provide essential water supply and
sewerage infrastructure for Bogota. It would con-
sist of (a) construction of a major water trans-
mission tunnel and main; (b) primary water distri-
bution system reinforcements; (c) water distribu-
tion system rehabilitation; (d) additions to water,
sewage and drainage networks for low-income neigh-
borhoods; (e) a reservoir for raw water storage;
(f)  metered  house  connections;  (g)  technical
assistance for the institutional improvement of
EAAB; and (h) implementation planning for a project
to control flooding and pollution of the Bogota
River.
The project would enable EAAB to utilize existing
water production capacity which was constructed un-
der previous Bank projects.   It is expected that
approximately 2.1 million persons would benefit
from the project by 1992, of which about 54% would
be the urban poor.
Risks:                   To finance the proposed project, however, EAAB will
have to secure export credits, to contain its costs
(especially personnel), and to raise its tariffs by
15% in real terms by the end of 1989. Because the
availability of export credits cannot be assured in
advance of bidding the equipment to be financed,
there is some risk of delay in the implementation
of the project.  Delays in taking actions to con-
trol the costs and to raise the tariffs may ad-
versely affect EAAB's financial wosition and the
project financing. However, EAAB is an experienced
borrower, having successfully implemented a larger
and more complicated project than the present one
under Loan 741-CO and contingent Bank financing for
high priority pipes has also been provided for in
the event that appropriate cofinancing cannot be
obtained for this item.

I. WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAG.E SECTOR
The Setting
1.01       Colombia's population (28 million in 1983) is currently growing at
an annual rate of 2.1%, down from 3.0% in 1964, due primarily to a rapid fer-
tility decline since 1964.  The spatial distribution of the population has
also changed considerably in recent years. As a result of high rural-urban
migration, the sbare of the urban population has more than doubled, increas-
ing from 31% in 1938 to over 662 currently. The four largest cities (Bogota,
Call, Medellin and Barranquilla), each with more than a million residents,
now account for about half of the total urban population. 1/
1.02      About 80% of Colombia's urban population has access to piped water
through bouse connections, and about 65X is served by a waterborne sewerage
system. In rural areas about 18% of the population has access to piped water
througb house connections and about 10% to a waterhorne sewerage system. Al-
though, with these service levels, Colombia would compare favorably with most
middle-income countries in the Region, the quality of the service remains de-
ficient, particularly in poor urban neighborboods and rural areas where water
and sanitation-related diseases rank among the principal causes of illness
and death. Water pollution is rapidly becoming a major prohlem in most large
cities which discharge their sewage without treatment. In 1982, infant mor-
tality, which can be partially attributed to poor water quality and sanita-
tion conditions, was 55 in 1,000 live births in Colombia, as compared with 27
In Chile, 39 in Venezuela, 44 in Argentina and 53 in Mexico. 2/
Sector Organization
1.03      The water supply and sewerage sector in Colombia is under the re-
sponsibility of the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) which, in coordination
with DNP,  formulates national sectoral policies.   Two institutions,  the
National Institute of Urban Development (INSFOPAL) and the National Institute
of Realth (INAS), are responsible for implementing these policies in urban
and rural areas,  respectively.   Both of these institutions have central
planning and supervisory functions and act as financial intermediaries for
sectoral investments.   The Urban Development Fund  (FFDU) of the Central
Mortgage Bank also provides financing for investments in the urban sector.
On the local level, different types of institutions have responsibilities for
constructing, maintaining and operating water supply and sewerage service
facilities.   In 28 principal cities, where about 75% of Colombia's urban
population is concentrated, Municipal Public Works Companies (EPM) are in
charge of water and sewerage services, and in many instances, also provide
other public services.  In most smaller towns, water supply and sanitation
services are provided hy Sanitation iorks Companies (EMPOS) over wbich
INSFOPAL exerts considerable influence. In rural areas, water and sanitation
facilities are built, operated and maintained by departmental offices of INAS
in coordination with the beneficiary communities.

-2-
Sector Performance
1.04       The performances of most sector institutions on botb the national
and local levels in Colombia leave mucb room for improvement. Weak admini-
stracion and management and poor financial performance are the main reasons
precluding a more efficient functioning of many operating entities. The comr
bined effect of low tariff levels and poor commercial practices, contrasted
with fast-rising operating costs (including personnel costs), has been almost
a perennial  financial problem  for many  companies.    Frequent  and  often
politically-motivated changes in top- and middle-management positions and
shortages of funds have been hindering financial and investment planning.
These shortcomings, together with a general lack of sufficiently trained work
force, manifest themselves, also, in poor upkeep and operation of many water
supply and sewerage systems and are reflected in generally high levels of
unaccounted-for water.
1.05           In part  these  shortcomings  are  related  to the  less-than-
satisfactory performance of INSFOPAL in the sector. INSFOPAL's weak manage-
ment has militated against the technical and financial le2dership role it was
meant to play in the sector and has allowed deficiencies in performance of
most local institutions to proliferate, e.g. inadequate and frequently-
changing managements, untrained staff, inefficient administrative and opera-
tional procedures, lack of clearly defined financial and lending policies,
and heavy dependence on the Covernment treasury for operating and investment
funds.  Secondly, the fact that the Government which, through its National
Tariff Board (JNT), controls the utilities' tariff policies, was in the past
reluctant to allow operating entities to increase their tariffs had been a
major impediment to a suitable financial development of the sector. Thirdly,
strong regional jealousies  make  it difficult  for INSFOPAL  to implement
changes on the local level.   Combined, these shortcomings have precluded any
realistic sector investment planning in the past and are responsible for
INSFOPAL's  poor  record  in  relating  its  project  selection  and  finance
functions to the objectives of promotion and enforcement of sound financial
and technical policies by operating entities.
1.06        Under the circumstances, the Bank and Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) expressed their concerns to the Government in late 1983 regarding
the status  of  their  respective  projects  in execution.   The Covernment
appointed a new manager at INSFOPAL, under whom INSFOPAL's administration has
improved considerably, and following the Government's authorization of a
major increase in the tariffs, the execution of an ongoing Bank-financed
project (Loan 1726-CO) has gained momentum.   However,  there still remain
serious shortcomings in sectoral policy (extending over the areas of
investment planning, resource mobilization, portfolio management, sector
organization, financial and institutional development) which are at the root
of the present difficulties to bring ahout lasting improvement in the
sector. Changes in INSFOPAL's financial and credit policies are required for
the company to function as an effective intermediary for future external
loans for mediumrsize and small cities and towns.



Sector Policies and Finances
1.07      The Covernment, under its plan for "development with equity," alms
at providing adequate water and sanitation services to all its citizens.  For
1990, it has projected serv'ce levels of 90% for water supply and 80% for
sewerage for urban areas, and service levels of 40% for water supply and 35%
for sewerage for rural areas.   This would mean reaching an additional 5.5
million people in urhan areas and ahout 2.0 million in rural areas.  The to-
tal cost would he about US$1,700 million (1983 prices) and would call for an-
nual investments of about US$300 million, not including operation and main-
tenance costs and investments needed to rehabilitate and repair existing fa-
cilities. To achieve the 1990 goals, historic annual average sector invest-
ment levels would have to he tripled, which is difficult considering the cur-
rent weaknesses of the sector :nstltutions and prevailing budgetary con-
straints. The G,overnment is aware of these constraints and is seeking in-
creased financing from external lending institutions, as well as advice on
the efficient use of available resources.
Bank Role and Sector Lending Strategy
1.08      Since 1968, the Bank has made 10 loans, totalling US$251.9 million,
for water supply and sewerage development in Colombia. The Bank funds ac-
counted for ahout 70% of the external loan amounts made available to the sec-
tor.  Seven loans, US$184.8 million in total, were made to EPMs in Bogota,
Cali, Palmira and Cucuta.  By far the largest horrower has heen the Bogota
Water and Sewerage Company (EAAB) to which the Bank has lent US$132 million
in three lending operations to finance in part total investments of about
US$450 million.   Three Bank loans, for a total amount of US$67.1 million,
were made to INSFOPAL for relending to local companies in support of 16
subprojects in medium-size and small cities and towns (para. 1.05).   In
addition, INSFOPAL was the channel used to finance water supply components of
the Bank financed urban development projects.   Several small rural water
supply  projects  were  supported  through  INAS  as  part  of  integrated
agricultural development projects and nutrition improvement projecte and a
recent power loan to Medellin financed a multipurpose project which Included
water supply benefits.
1.09       Of the Bank-financed projects, the projects in Bogota have fared
better than others in the sector. While EAAB has developed into a relatively
efficient institution, the performances of the other companies receiving Bank
financing (Cali, Palmira and subhorrowers under INSFOPAL loans) have not been
fully satisfactory.  Although most of the projects Involved were physically
completed after lengthy delays, institutional development goals were only
partially achieved and the compa.ies financial performances in most cases
have not improvod to a degree originally envisaged (para. 1.04).  Project
completion reports have been prepared for two projects, and two others have
undergone performance audits. 3/ The audit reports have been critical of the

overestimates of demand for water; delays in project execution which, in an
inflationary environment, resulted in cost overruns for most of the projects;
and the borrowers' failure to raise water rates and limit the growth of oper-
ating costs sufficiently to comply with financial performance targets.
1.10      Lessons learned from the implementatton of earlier Bank projects in
Colombia have been taken into account in preparation of subsequent projects.
Demand projections are now prepared with greater care, using more conserva-
tive estimates of population growth and consumption as the basis for finan-
cial projections. Adequate subsurface investigations are being required for
tunnels and major structures to minimize delays and cost overruns after con-
struction is in progress.   More realistic implementation schedules are being
adopted, and projects are presented to the Board only when the physical works
are ready for bidding.  More detailed and specific plans of action are also
part of projects that have been considered lately.   Most importantly, the
Bank has concluded that multi-city lending is no longer feasible until either
INSFOPAL can Improve its performance considerably or alternative intermediary
arrangements are in place.
1.11         The Bank's current strategy calls for continued lending on a
selective basis to the larger municipal companies which have demonstrated the
will to improve their standards of performance.  The loan which the Bank made
to Cucuta (Loan No. 2470-CO) in 1984 was conceived as a part of this
strategy, and the proposed loan to Bogota would fall in the same category.
Barranquilla and Cartagena, where project preparation work is now in
progress, also will benefit from direct Bank lending. The IDB Is involved in
lending to two of Colombia's major cities (Medellin and Bucaramanga) and may
consider lending to Call.  Direct lending to suitable municipal companies in
major cities enables the Ba.tk to assist the Government in its efforts to
extend improved water supply and sewerage services to large segments of the
population (including the urban poor) at minimum unit cost and will have to
continue.
1.12       The Bank's resumption of lending for medium-size and simall cities
and towns will depend on progress in the implementation of Improved sector
policies and the availability of a suitable intermediary for multi-citv lend-
ing which would also implement national programs for sectoral improvements
(in areas such as leak detection, training, Institutional development, and
metering).   In spite of recent improvements in INSFOPAL's performance, it
still does not have the mandate nor capacity to take on these intermediarv
functions. Ongoing sector work is addressing these issues and specific Bank
recommendations on these and related matters are expected to be discussed
with the Government in the near future.
1.13       A rural water supplv component (total cost USSI6 million), which
forms part of the recently appraised health project, will provtde the Bank
with the opportunitv to support a modest investment program for rural water
supply systems and strengthen INAS, the specialized agencv for rural areas,
through a technical assistance program and the preparation of a National
Rural Water Supply Plan. This plan is expected to define more accurately the
needs and priorities in the rural subsector and develop an Investment
strategy, which together with the experience acquired in working with INAS,
could help in paving the wav for increased Investment in rural water supplv
to be supported by the Bank and other lenders in the future.

II. THE BORROWER AND IMPLEMENTING. AGENCY
General
2.01      The Borrower and implementing agency would he Empresa de Acueduc-
to y Alcantarillado de Bogota (EAAB), an autonomous municipal agency re-
sponsihle for providing water, sewerage, and drainage services to the Spec-
lal District of Bogota (includes the city of Bogota and several small
neighhoring towns). Since the Bank's first loan in 1968 (para. 2.11), EAAB
has not only become financially viahle, hut also has Increased service cov-
erage, improved its management efficiency and strengtben Its project
implementation capahilities.  However, to cope with the complex issues it
will face in the future, EAAB needs to further improve its efficiency and
increase its productivity.  An assessment of EAAB's present institutional
capabilities is summarized below and descrihed in detail in Annex 1.
Institutional Arrangement and Management
2.02      EAAB is governed hy a seven-member Board of Directors wbich in-
cludes two representatives from the District Council, four from financial
Institutions   (including  Banco  de  la  Republica  and  Banco  Central
Hipotecario, Government hanks), and the Mayor of Bogota, who chairs the
Board.  EAAB's annual hudget and contracting of debt, which are approved by
the Board, are subject to review by the Bogota District Council.   The
Mayor, who is appointed by the President of Colombia, appoints the General
Manager.   The rGeneral Manager appoints all EAAB's  employees.   EAAB's
organizational structure is generally adequate to carry out the project and
expand services during project execution (the present organization chart is
presented in Annex 1).
2.01      Althougb political considerations have influenced the appointment
of EAAB's top management, the resulting teams on balance have been good.
The present General Manager is a competent administrator. The second level
managers are qualified for their positions also and are running their units
efficiently.  Professional staff, mostly in their jobs for several years,
have provided continuity to EAAB's operations.
Personnel
2.04       EAAB's staff is generally qualified at all levels.  They could
benefit, however, from better directed training to overcome minor shortcomr
ings in some areas and achieve state of the art proficiency.  EAAB has a
very competitive compensation package, and has had no problem in retaining
and hiring qualified staff. The present staff to water connection ratio of
4.9 per tbousand is one of the lowest in Latin America and comparable with
ratios deemed adequate in industrialized countries. Productivity as deter-
mined by this ratio, however, could he further improved by introducing new
technology to simplify operating procedures and improve information han-
dling.   Increased productivity of EAAB's personnel would he an important
goal of the proposed project since personnel costs currently are 70% of
EAAB's total operating cost.



-6-
Project Planning and Implementation
2.05       EAAB prepares and implements projects satisfactorily.  Its staff
is responsible for planning, designing and supervising the construction of
small projects of a routine nature. To design and supervise the construc-
tion of complex works, EAAB retains consultants wbo work under the supervi-
sion of EAAB's staff.
Commercial Administration
2.06        EAAB has a good collection record; however, billings could be
speeded up, new connection procedures simplified, and the efficiency of all
its commercial operations improved.  Also, unaccounted-for water (40% in
1983) remains a problem.  Underregistration of meters is suspected as a
major cause of unaccounted-for water.  Reduction of unaccounted-for water
and improved efficiency of EAAB's commercial operations are objectives of
the proposed project.
Information and Control Systems and Insurance
2.07       Wbile adequate to account for EAAB's investments and operations,
EAAB's information systems could he further modernized to enhance manage-
ment decision making and control. EAAB's management could significantly
benefit from an improved management reporting system, improved financial
modeling, and enhanced compatibility among all of EAAB's information sys-
temrs. Also, cost accounting should he further developed to allow EAAB to
better control costs. differentiate between water and sewerage costs and
design a tariff structure which reflects the true division of costs.
2.08      EAAB's overall internal control, audit and i-surance arrangements
are satisfactory. The Bogota District Controller's Office carries out an
ongoing review of EAAB's operations, which includes the clearance of some
transactions (prior control). EAAB carries fire and casualty insurance on
buildings, stocks and equipment subject to these risks and tbird party
liability for selected exposures. EAAB relies for otber risks in security
measures to minimize their occurrence.
Plan of Action for the Institutional Strengtbening of EAAB
2.09      To further improve EAAB's efficiency and increase its productiv-
ity, during negotiations, EAAB agreed to the Plan of Action described in
Annex 5. The Plan of Action is designed to bring about improvements in the
following areas: (a) control of personnel costs; (b) reduction of
unaccounted-for water; (c) commercial procedures; (d) training; and (e)
management  information  and  control  systems.         EAAB's  progress  in
implementing the Plan of Action would be closely monitored by the Bank.
Monitoring  indicators  would  include:    (a)  employees  per  1,000 water
connections; (b) percentage of unaccounted-for water; (c) percentage of
working meters; (d) personnel costs per ml of water sold; (e) accounts
receivable;   and (f) water sold per account.   Technical assistance to
support the Plan of Action is described in para. 3.17 and Annex 4.

EAAB's Performance Under Past Loans
2.10       The Bank has already made three loans to EAAB.  The first (Loan
536-CO made in 1968) financed expansion of the Tibito water supply and
transmission system. This project was successfully completed in 1976. The
second (Loan 741-CO made in 1971) financed construction of the Chingaza di-
version (a dam, reservoir, 38 km of tunnel and 6 km of pipe), the Wiesner
water treatment plant, the Santa Ana treated water storage reservoir, a 20
km treated water transmission main and 100 km of primary distribution
mains.   EAAB faced many difficult problems during the implementation of
this project.   The contractor originally responsible for construction of
the Chingaza diversion was unable to comply with the requirements of his
contract and had to be replaced.  The second contractor encountered high
concentrations of methane gas during excavation of the tunnel.   The gas
created unsafe construction conditions which led to a two year suspension
of the work while a solution to the problem was researched and implemented.
This problem and the resulting delays increased the cost of the Chingaza
diversion from US$85 million at appraisal to a final cost of US$300 mil-
lion. At the same time, EAAB's water sales and revenues turred out to be
substantially less than the appraisal estimates as a result of an unexpect-
ed decline in the growth rate of Bogota's population. To cope with the new
situation created by its reduced revenues and the large cost overruns of
the Chingaza diversion (in excess of US$200 million), EAAB first delayed
implementation and later eliminated the 20 km treated water transmission
main and half the length of primary distribution mains included in the pro-
ject.   A 1975 study undertaken by EAAB indicated that these components
could safely be delayed until 1985. The modified project was completed in
1983.
2.11      The third Bank Loan to EAAB (Loan 1697-CO made in 1979) financed
primary water distribution mains, secondary water, sewerage and drainage
networks, drainage canals and sewerage interceptors. In 1981, water short-
ages began occurring in the southwest area of Bogota, four years earlier
than indicated in the 1975 study. These unexpected shortages confirmed the
need for a major transmission main similar to the one eliminated from the
second project. EAAB and the Bank agreed that a new master plan was needed
before the transmission main was constructed. Accordingly, the project was
modified to make funds available for preparation of such a master plan. It
was also decided to delete from the project construction of 25 km of pri-
mary distribution mains and concentrate instead on the construction of sec-
ondary water and sewerage networks. The execution of the third project as
modified is now proceeding well.  As of February 18, 1984, the loan was
fully committed and 90% of it was disbursed. Project completion is cur-
rently scheduled for June 30, 1985.
2.12       EAAB has substantially complied, and complies at present, with
financial covenants under Loan 1697-CO.  In 1984 the expected rate of re-
turn of 4% would be short of the covenanted (6%). EAAB in 1984, neverthe-
less, would cover all its cash needs and achieve an adequate financial per-
formance to undertake the project (para. 4.03).



-8-
2.13      EAAB has been late in presenting audit reports (its 1983 report
was five months late); however, its 1984 report is expected to be submitted
on time.  Under the project, as in previous Bank-assisted projects, EAAB
would be required to annually continue submitting its financial statements
audited by external independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank.   The
auditors' reports would be sent to the Bank no later than four months after
the close of each fiscal year.

III. THE PROJECT
General
3.01       The proposed project would complement earlier Bank-assisted EAAB
projects (paras. 2.10 and 2.11) which helped EAAB develop sufficient water
production capacity for Bogota until 2005 but left expansion of the distribu-
tion system and construction of emergency storage for later. Of significant
importance is the provision for technical assistance for institutional im-
provement and for addressing the land development, economic, financial and
institutional issues associated with plans to reduce flooding and pollution
of the Bogota River (the technical solutions were developed with assistance
provided under Loans 741-CO and 1697-CO). The project will be implemented by
EAAB. The Bogota District Planning Department and the Regional Bogota Plains
Autonomous Corporation (CAR) would participate in the Bogota River studies.
Project Origin
3.02      In 1981, areas in the southwest of Bogota began experiencing water
shortages due to restrictions in the distribution system.  In response to
these shortages, EAAB requested that the Bank reallocate funds from Loan
1697-CO to finance a master plan distribution study aimed at identifying the
least cost solution for distributing water to meet existing and future re-
quirements.  The first stage of the plan became the basis for the project.
Raw water storage for the Wiesner water treatment plant was added to the
project after a blockage of the Chingaza tunnel in January 1984 confirmed
that it should no longer be delayed (para. 3.05). Technical assistance for
addressing the development and implementation issues associated with the
proposed Bogota River pollution and flood control projects and technical
assistance for the institutional strengthening of EAAB were added to the
project as a result of discussions with EAAB during project preparation.
Project Location
3.03      The proposed project is located in Bogota, the capital of Colombia,
and also its principal, financial, administrative, commercial, industrial,
cultural and educational center. In 1983, the Special District of Bogota had
a population of 4.3 million.4/ As center of the national administrative de-
cision making process, Bogota has attracted considerable industry. Foremost
of these are automotive assembly, printing and publishing, tire and rubber
products manufacturing, electrical appliance manufacturing and plastic resin
production. Over 30 banks have their main branches in Bogota, including the
Central Bank. A stock exchange was established in 1928.
Existing Services
3.04      Bogota has high service levels (95Z water and 90% sewage) and ade-
quate sources of supply. The existing facilities are described in detail in
Annex 2. To ensure the continuation of good water sewerage and drainage ser-
vices in the future, additional investments are required to reinforce and ex-

58,000, which is servlced on a retail basis by EAAB.



-1i-
tend the water distribution and sewage collection networks. Water shortages
and low system pressures occur in low-income areas in the southwest area of
the city due to distribution system restrictions.  These restrictions also
limit the use of Chingaza water (Loan 741-CO) to 55% of available capacity.
Because Chingaza water does not require pumping and is low in turbidity, it
has a much lower unit production cost than EAAB's other major sources.  To
take advantage of the low-cost Chingaza water, to eliminate low pressures and
water shortages and to provide for anticipated growth, reinforcement of the
distribution system and construction of a major transmission main linking the
Chingaza supply source to the southwest areas of the city are needed.
3.05      Initially placed in operation in August 1983, the Chingaza supply
system had to be shutdown in January 1984 due to rockfalls in one of the tun-
nel sections.  The failure took sixteen months to repair and confirmed the
need for a raw water storage reservoir near the Wiesner water treatment plant
which the system supplies.   Storage would allow periodic shutdowns of the
tunnel for inspection and maintenance which are needed to prevent future
failures. Raw water storage has always been a part of the Chingaza master
plan, but until recently, scheduled for implementation in a later stage. It
will become more important in the future as the water demand increases and
Bogota's dependence on the Chingaza supply system becomes greater.
3.06       In 1983, EAAB experienced over 9,000 water main breaks, an exces-
sive number for a system its size. Most of the breaks have occurred in mains
constructed with asbestos cement pipe which was not properly protected to
withstand the acidic soil prevalent in the Bogota area. A small percentage
of the breaks is due to deficient construction techniques.  EAAB has taken
appropriate measures with new installations but is faced with the need to re-
place a significant amount of existing pipe. Not all breaks have been limit-
ed to small mains. During the past four years, the 78-in. Tibito transmis-
sion main, the largest and most important main in the distribution system,
has experienced five breaks. Prestressed concrete pipe was used in the con-
struction of this main, and the breaks have resulted from corrosion of the
prestressing wire used in the fabrication of the pipe.  It is unlikely that
the corrosion can be prevented and further breaks are expected in the
future.
3.07      Bogota faces serious water pollution and drainage problems.  Flood-
ing exists in some areas of the city due to lack of adequate drainage works;
however, most flooding occurs when the Bogota River overflows its banks.
Also, there is severe pollution in the Bogota River because of lack of
treatment. Pollution from Bogota has already reached the Magdalena River, a
source of water for many cities.   Technical solutions to the Bogota River
flood and pollution control problems have been defined by other studies
financed in part with Loans 741-CO and 1697-CO; however, the economic
justification and investment priority of the project is not clear and the
institutional, land development, financial and cost recovery aspects of
implementing the technical solutions still need to be addressed.  EAAB has
the responsibility for flood and pollution control but lacks the authority to
implement the solutions.   Additional planning is required to clarify the
economic issues, propose legislative changes, and develop an action plan for
the orderly and efficient implementation of this program.



-11-
Water Demand
3.08      EAAB's annual water sales are projected to increase by 48X from 241
Mm3 (7.6 m3/sec) in 1983 to 367 Hm3 (11.3 m3/sec) in 1992, the final year of
project implementation. Annual production requirements will increase by 20Z
from 401 Mm3 (12.7 m3/sec) to 495 Mm3 (15.7 m3/sec) during the same period.
These projections are based on a 1992 population of 5.6 million served by
740,000 accounts; water sales per account of 40 m3 per month; and conserva-
tive estimates of bulk water sales (3% of total). By 2005, annual production
requirements are projected to reach 770 M13 (24.4 m3/sec), the capacity of
existing production facilities, allowing for maximum day requirements. De-
tailed population and demand projections are included in Annex 3.
Project Objectives and the Bank's Role
3.09      The main objective of the proposed project would be to provide the
water supply and sewerage infrastructure essential for the uninterrupted
growth of Bogota. The project would accomplish this objective by:
(a) removing EAAB's water distribution system constraints which now
prevent the most efficient use of the existing production
capacity and cause water shortages in the southwest (mostly
low-income) areas of Bogota;
(b) increasing the reliability of water supply to Bogota through
the construction of a raw water storage reservoir; and
(c) improving EAAB's productivity and increasing its operational
efficiency through technical assistance.
3.10       The project would be in line with the Bank's general approach re-
lated to infrastructure lending in Colombia, which emphasizes quick yielding
investments and a more intensive use of existing facilities before addition
of new capacity. These objectives would be achieved by making use of EAAB's
heavy infrastructure investments made in the past, especially under the
Bank's second project with EAAB (Loan 741-CO).  The project would also help
the poorer segments of the population. In addition, through its involvement
with the project, the Bank would provide continued institutional support to
EAAB.  It would support sound financial policies by EAAB, including mainten-
ance of adequate tariffs.   The Bank would also help the Bogota District,
through EAAB, to effectively address a major urban environmental issue by un-
dertaking studies on the financial, economic, legal, institutional and land
reclamation aspects of the Bogota River flood and pollution control plan.
Until these problems are solved, the plan cannot be implemented.   Finally,
the Bank would assist EAAB in securing supplementary external financing for
the proposed project.

-13-
Part  E:  Implementation Planning for the Bogota River Pollution and Flood
Control Projects
1.        A study of the economic, financial, institutional, and land devel-
opment issues related to the control of flooding and pollutior in
the Bogota River.6/
2.        Preparation of final designs for the first stage construction of
the Bogota River water pollution control plant.
Part F:   Institutional Strengthening of EAAB
1.        The provision of technical assistance to EAAB in the fields of man-
agement information and control, financial planning, commercial op-
erations, training, and unaccounted-for water reduction.6/
2.        Acquisition and utilization of operation and maintenance equipment,
data processing equipment, communications equipment, instrumenta-
tion,  training  equipment  and  materials  and  leak  detection
instruments .7/
3.12           The  transmission  and  primary  water  distribution  additions
included in Part A of the project are sufficient to meet the year 2005
maximum day demand in the present EAAB service area and are consistent with
future additions included in the master plan. A large part of the capacity
provided by these additions should have been provided by similar additions
included in the project descriptions of Loans 741-CO and 1697-CO but not
constructed (paras. 2.10 and 2.11).  The estiwated construction cost of the
uncompleted additions in January 1985 prices is US$61 million (30Z of the
estimated  base  cost  of  the  proposed  project  less  engineering  and
administration). The conditions which necessitated these distribution system
additions being eliminated from the earlier projects were beyond the
Government's and EAMB's control and could not be foreseen by them (e.g.
difficult geological formations and poor performance by the contractor). In
addition, their elimination was justified by the fact that the projected
demand did not materialize.   In compliance with its commitments under the
Bank Loans (741-CO and 1697-CO), EAMB controlled the increase in its costs
and raised its tariffs about 50Z in real terms to be able to finance around
35% of its 1971-84 investment program through internal cash generation.
Unfortunately, the costs of the transmission and distribution components of
these earlier projects were beyond the limits which EAAB could raise from its
own resources, or from external sources, given the lack of receptivity in
the international capital markets.   EAAB's decision at that time to drop
these components was, therefore, fully justified under the circumstances, and
was taken in consultation with the Bank.
3.13       The rehabilitation component, Part B of the project, would provide
funds for the repair of water distribution system leaks discovered as part of
the unaccounted-for water control program (Part F of the project) and assist
EAAB with its pipe replacement program.  A program to locate and reinforce
weakened sections of the 78-in. Tibito transmission main would be included in
this part of the project.
6/ Terms of reference available in the project file.
71 Includes goods financed with export credits.



-14-
3.14      Most of the secondary networks required to supply new customers are
expected to be provided by private developers.   The secondary networks and
connections included in Part C of the project would be a continuation of
EAAB's program begun under Loan 741-CO to construct and finance networks for
the poor in illegally constructed subdivisions and squatter areas without
services.  In 1983, 50 km of secondary networks were constructed under this
program.
3.15      The raw water storage in Part D of the project would be provided by
the San Rafael reservoir.   The reservoir would consist of 50 million m3
off-stream storage in a natural depression located near the Wiesner water
treatment plant on land already owned by EAAB. Excess water from the Chuza
reservoir, the main raw water source for Bogota, and the unregulated flows
from the Blanco and Teusaca Rivers would be diverted to the reservoir and
stored for use during periods when the Chingaza tunnel is shut down for
inspection and maintenance.  A pumping station would be constructed to pump
water from the reservoir to the plant.  The San Rafael reservoir would also
provide an additional 2.0 m3/sec production capacity (needed in 2006) and 15
GWh each year in additional power from existing hydro plants by regulation of
the Teusaca and Blanco Rivers.  The additional production capacity will make
it possible to delay by three years EAAB's next major investment in
production capacity.  The reservoir would also have recreation benefits due
to its close proximity to Bogota.
3.16          Part E of the project would complete preparations  for the
implementation of the Bogota River flood and pollution control projects.
Consultants would be hired to study the issues, propose solutions, complete
final design and develop a plan of action for project implementation (para.
3.07).  During negotiations, EAAB agreed with the draft terms of reference
for the study and plan preparation (available in the project file).
3.17       Under Part F of the project, consultants would be hired to assist
EAAB in carrying out the Plan of Action to improve its efficiency and
increase its productivity (para. 2.09 and Annex 5). A management consultant
would be hired to provide technical assistance for improving EAAB's
commercial operations and its management information and control systems. An
engineering firm would be engaged to assist with the unaccounted-for water
control program, and training consultants would be hired to assist EAAB to
implement a training plan prepared during appraisal.   During negotiations,
EAAB agreed with draft terms of reference for the institutional technical
assistance, the draft unaccounted-for water reduction program and the draft
training plan (available in the project file).  Part F of the project also
provides for the purchase of equipment and scholarships to support the Plan
of Action and the purchase of equipment to improve EAAB's maintenance
capabilities.
Project Cost
3.18          The project cost, excluding interest during construction  is
estimated at US$316 million. EAAB is exempt from import duties but must pay
a sales tax on imported goods, a value added tax on locally manufactured
goods and a special tax on foreign consultant fees. Taxes totalling US$10.8
million  are  reflected  in the  local  cost  component  of the  taxed items.
Consulting services are estimated to cost US$5.6 million for technical

assistance, studies and designs and US$15.3 million for construction
supervision.        Man-month  requirements  for  total  consulting  services  are
estimated  at  2,023  of  which  275  would  be  for  foreign  consultants.    A
breakdown of consultant man-month requirements and cost estimates are
available  in  the project  file.   Physical  contingencies  add  US$17.1  million
(about 8% of base cost) and price contingencies another US$70.7 million
(about 31% of base cost). Capitalized interest and fees during construction
bring the total financing required  to US$354 million.   The foreign exchange
cost of the project, including project investment, capitalized interest and
fees amount to US$216 million (61% of total financing required). The project
cost  estimate  is  summarized  in  Table  3.1.    Detailed  cost  estimates  and

Project Financing Plan
3.19       The Bank Loan would finance US$129 million of the project's US$216
million foreign exchange requirements. The Bank Loan would be repaid over a
period of 17 years, which includes five years of grace. The remaining US$87
million in foreign exchange would be financed with US$42 million in export
credits, US$8 million in foreign commercial bank loans and US$37 million
(capitalized interest and fees) from EAAB's internal cash generation.   The
commercial bank loans would finance the down payments required for goods
purchased with export credits.   Both the export credits and complementary
Bank loans are expected to be obtained at a total financial cost of about 12X
a year and to be payable in eight years after completion of the components
for which goods are acquired.  EAAB would finance US$117 million of local
cost out of its internal cash generation and contributions from developers
and customers.   EEEB is expected to contribute US$20 million towards the
local cost of the San Rafael Reservoir in return for power benefits it would
derive from it. To assure the Bank of EEEB's participation and the financial
feasibility of the San Rafael reservoir, during negotiations, EAAB agreed not
to request disbursements for this component until it signed a cost-sharing
agreement with EEEB satisfactory to the Bank. The project financing plan is
summarized in Table 3.2 (EAAB's overall financial plan is presented in para.
4.12).

3.20       Export credits and complementary commercial bank loans would be
used to finance pipe, valves and fittings and pumping equipment, under
Parts A.2, A.3, D.1 and D.2 and a part of the operation and maintenance
equipment under Part F.2 of the project as shown in Table 3.3.  For the
financing of these goods, the Bank on behalf of EAAB has already contacted
the US, German, Japanese, Canadian, Austrian and French export credit
agencies and all have indicated an interest in providing financial
assistance. The availability of export credits and commercial bank loans,
nevertheless, cannot be assured until after bids for the goods to be
financed are received.   Most of the goods to be financed with export
credits are not scheduled for bidding until after Board presentation.
Thus, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from EAAB that, failing
to secure the necessary export credits and complementary commercial bank
loans, they would secure alternative financing for the project satisfactory
to the Bank.  As the pipe for Part A.2 of the project is of the highest
priority for overcoming existing water shortages,    during negotiations,
the Bank agreed to allow EAAB to use Bank loan funds for this item In
preference to other items scheduled for procurement later in the project,
but only in the event that it were unsuccessful in obtaining cofinancing
for the pipe.

3.21        The overall risk of the financing plan is considered moderate.
With Government support, EAAB could cover any shortfall in export credit fi-
nancing through a combination of some financing from local official banks and
foreign banks, slight realignment of investment priorities and moderately
higher tariffs.
Execution of the Project
3.22      EAAB will be responsible for Implementing the project.  An engineer
in EAAB's Planning Department has been selected as overall project manager
and will have the responsibility of coordinating the project and responding
to Bank requests.   Personnel from the various EAAB Departments will manage
specific components.
3.23      Final designs for the major construction components (tunnel, prima-
ry distribution mains, pumping stations, distribution reservoirs and San
Rafael reservoir) have been or are being prepared by consultants satisfactory
to the Bank. Final designs for secondary networks and specifications for the
purchase of equipment would be prepared by EMAB's own staff.   Consultants
would be used to supervise the construction of the major works such as the
tunnel, the larger primary distribution mains, the pumping stations and the
San Rafael reservoir.   During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
EAAB that consultants satisfactory to the Bank would be hired to supervise
construction  of  the  tunnel.    Construction  supervislon  of  the secondary
networks and some of the smaller primary distribution mains would be by
EAAB's own staff.   EAAB inspectors would be used on all project works and
those assigned to the larger works would report to the consultants.
Technical assistance for the Plan of Action would be provided by both local
and  foreign  consultants.    These  consultants  would  be  supervised  by
individuals from the departments affected with overall coordination being
provided by the project manager.
3.24      The Bogota River implementation study would be carried out by EMAB
in cooperation with the Regional Bogota Plains Autonomous Corporation (CAR),
a regional planning agency, and the Bogota District Planning Department.  A
coordinating committee of representatives from these agencies, established to
carry out the technical studies financed under the Bank's third project with
EAAB (Loan 1697-CO), would also carry out the new study. EMAR would continue
as the lead agency. In this capacity, EAAB would hire all consultants, pay
their fees, supervise the financial, institutional and economic aspects of
the study and supervise the final designs of the water pollution control
plant. The Bogota District Planning Department would supervise the land de-
velopment aspects of the study.  CAR would act in an advisory capacity as a
member of the coordinating committee. During negotiations, EAAR agreed that
they would coordinate the carrying out of the studv with CAR and the District
Planning Department.
3.25       All steps necessary to permit immediate initiation of the project
execution once the loan is signed and declared effective have been taken.
Land required for the San Rafael reservoir, pumping stations and distribution
reservoirs is already owned by EMSB. Right-of-way for some of the water dis-
tribution mains are still required; however, no acquisition problems are an-
ticipated.  Final designs for 70X of the works to be constructed have been
completed.   A project schedule is included in Annex 8.  Annex 9 includes a
list of key dates for the bidding and award of major contracts, including
those financed with export credits. All works would be completed by December
31, 1992.



3.26       The San Rafael reservoir would include the construction of dikes
which exceed the Bank's minimum requirements for the appointment of a design
review board and inspections during operation.   During negotiations, EAAB
agreed to the appointment of a board satisfactory to the Bank and to
inspections by a qualified engineer during operation of the reservoir.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.27       By increasing the water supply to the Bogota District, the project
will increase sewage flows discharged into the River which is already heavily
polluted.   Although no immediate improvement in the quality of the Bogota
River water will result from the project, the ultimate implementation of
works designed to reduce pollution and improve the water quality of the River
in the future will be brought closer to realization as a result of implemen-
tation studies  included  in the project.   With the project, however, low
pressures in the distribution system and intermittent water supply that
create unsafe conditions for the distribution of water for domestic use will
be overcome.   In addition,  the provision of sewerage networks under the
project, by removing sewage from densely populated areas, would improve
health conditions.

-20-
3.29      Civil works contracts larger than US$1,000,000 and goods contracts
larger than US$200,000 financed in part with Bank loan funds would be procur-
ed through international competitive bidding (ICB). Local competitive bid-
ding (LCB) would apply for procurement below these limits except for the in-
stallation of secondary networks and repair work which would be contracted
directly by work order to prequalified contractors at unit prices set by
EAAB.   A similar procedure was used successfully under Bank Loan 1697-CO.
The maximum value of a work order would not exceed US$40,000.  Bidding for
pumping equipment and heavy construction equipment financed with export
credits and complementary commercial bank loans would be limited to suppliers
who could provide financing. Bid evaluation would take into account financ-
ing offered as well as price of the equipment and materials bid. Pipes for
Part A.2 of the project (para. 3.20) would be bid following Bank ICB
guidelines with requests for optional submission of financing offers. Once
bids are received for the pipes, if it is determined by EAAB in consultation
with the Bank that there are no suitable financing offers, the Bank would
release loan funds to cover the procurement awarded to the lowest cash
evaluated bid. All consulting contracts would be procured in accordance with
Bank guidelines.   The limits for prior review of bidding documents by the
Bank (US$500,000 for equipment contracts and US$2,000,000 for civil works
contracts) would result in a coverage of about 90% of the total estimated
value of the goods contracts and 80% of civil works contracts.
3.30       Contracts for the supply of pipe, meters, equipment and materials
with an aggregate estimated value of US$93 million are expected to go to for-
eign manufacturers. This amount includes equipment, pipes and materials to
be financed with suppliers credits. Small diameter pipes with an aggregate
estimated value of US$12 million would probably be won by local manufactur-
ers. Qualifying local manufacturers would receive a preference in bid eval-
uation of 15% of the CIF price or the prevailing import duty, whichever is
less.   The tunnel contract with an estimated value of US$41 million would
probably be won by a foreign contractor. The remaining civil works contracts
with an aggregate estimated value of US$125 million will probably go to local
contractors. Most of the consulting contracts are expected to go to local
firms who would then either joint venture with foreign firms or subcontract
expertise which is not available locally. A list of major contracts expected
to be awarded and the value of each is included in Annex 9. EAAB agreed to
the -above  procurement  arrangements  during  negotiations.    In  separate
negotiations, the Government has provided assurances that import licenses for
Bank-financed and export credit financed goods under all Bank projects would
be granted promptly by the Institute of External Commerce (INCOMEX).
Dlisbursements
3.31      The Bank would disburse as follows:



-21-
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures and 70% of local expenditures for
materials and equipment;
(b)  65% for civil works for the  tunnel under  Part  A.1  of  the
project and 32% for all other civil works;
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures and 50X of local expenditures for
consultants' services; and
(d)  100% of expenditures for scholarships and training.
3.32       Disbursements for all foreign currency expenditures would be sup-
ported by standard documentation.  Reimbursements through statement of ex-
penditure (SOE) would be allowed for all local expenditure disbursements
Extensive use of the SOE procedure is justified on the Bank's past good ex-
perience  with  EAAB  in  adhering  to  Bank  procedures  and  guidelines.
Retroactive financing of up to US$3.0 million equivalent for expenditures
incurred after July 1, 1984 would be permitted. The proposed allocation of
loan proceeds is shown in Annex 10. The loan closing date would be June 30,
1993, six months following project completion. The disbursement period would
be eight years, the average disbursement period for all loans to Colombia.
The schedule of expected disbursements by quarter is presented in Annex 11.
3.33         In order to reduce the interval during which EAAB would finance
with its own funds the Bank's share of the project, a Special Account would
be opened at the Bank of the Republic, Colombia's Central Bank, and a initial
deposit of US$8.0 million would be made into it through one or more withdraw-
als from the Loan Account. EAAB would be entitled to make withdrawals from
the Special Account upon application to the Bank of the Republic. At the
same time, EAAB would forward disbursement applications covering the amount
of its withdrawals to the Bank which would replenish the Special Account.
During negotiations, EAAB agreed that the Special Account would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF EAAB
General
4.01       EAAB bas been able to overcome a cash shortage caused by cost
overruns in its sizeable 1971-83 investment program.  An a result of appro-
priate financial measures, EAAB is now in an adequate position to undertake
additioaal large investments to meet the water supply and sewerage needs of
Bogota.   Througb  careful control of costs and a moderate and gradual
increase in the level of tariffs in real terms, EAAB is expected to
satisfactorily finance the project and other priority investments during
1985-93.
EAAB's Past and Current Financial Performance
4.02       EAAB carried out substantial investments and covered all of its
cash requirements in 1980 and 1981. In 1982 and 1983, bowever, cost over-
runs ia the Cbingaza project taxed EAAB's financial capabilities to the
limit. Because of these overruns, increased expenditures, delayed tariff
action and lack of mediumr-term financing, EAAB was severely short of work-
ing capital in 1982 and 1983. Summary income and cash flow data, extracted
from EAAB's financial statements for 1980-19848/ are sbown in Table 4.1
4.03      Through a combination of appropriate financial measures, EAAB has
achieved a satisfactory financial performance in 1984. EAAB increased tar-
iffs by about 27% in real terms in mid-1983 and has received Government ap-
proval to continue for an indefinite period 1.5Z montbly tariff increases
(whicb are about in line with inflation), for whicb previous autbority ex-
pired by mid-1984.   In April 1984, it obtained through the Government a
US$20 million mediumr-term foreign bank loan to finance completion of the
Chingaza project. In addition, EAAB stopped hiring new staff and restrict-
ed investments to those already committed or urgent   as a result, EAAB is
expected to cover all of its 1984 cash requirements and meet the 1.5 debt-
service coverage ratio covenanted for Loan 1697-CO. However, its 1984 rate
of return will only be 4Z versus 6% covenanted for Loan 1697-CO.
4.04      A 6% rate of return on revalued fixed assets is no longer consid-
ered necessary for EAAB's short-term cash needs or to finance its long-term
investments, including tbe proposed project.  The 6% rate of return under
Loan 1697-CO was based on investment needs of a 1984 population of 5.3 mil-
lion, growing at an annual rate of 5.62.  In sbarp contrast, Bogota's 1983
population was 4.3 million and the current annual growth rate is only 3.6%.
Water sales per account are also lower than projected under Loan 1697-CO
(40 m3/month actual versus 49 m.31month projected). Because of these fac-
tors, water sales are now about 23% lower than Loan 1697-CO appraisal pro-
jections and EAAB's production capacity including the Chingaza project
(Loan 741-CO) is now sufficient until 2005. Consistent with these develop-
ments, EAAB prudently deferred not only investments in water production ca-
pacity, but also in water distribution and drainage canal construction.
8/ Financial statements of 1982 and 1984 are presented in Annex 12; those
for 1980 and 1981 are available in the project file.

4.05       To compensate in part for lower sales, EAAB has raised its tar-
iffs 50% in real terms since 1980. As a result, the current average tarift
is now 10% higher than the long-run marginal cost of water. By further
raising tariffs 15% in real terms during implementation of the proposed
project, EAAB would achieve 3.5Z to 4.5% rates of return and generate
enough cash to finance about 54Z of total investments during the same per-
iod.   Rates of return in this range are recommended for EAAB's existing
loans and the proposed loan (paras. 4.15 and 4.18).
EAAB's Financial Structure
4.06      EAAB's main revenues are income derived from the provision of wa-
ter and sewerage services and charges for new water and sewerage connec-
tions.   EAAB also derives some income from non-operational activities
(about 3% of operating revenues).   Capital contributions in the form of
secondary  water,   sewerage  and  drainage  networks  from  developers,
contribution to the cost of secondary networks from customers and
betterment levies (about 52 of gross income) complement EAAB's income as a
source of funds.
4.07       Under the present tariff structure (Annex 13), EAAB's customers
are divided into four categories: official, commercial, industrial and res-
idential.  Residential customers in turn are divided into six categories
based on the location and quality of dwelling. EAAB's tariff structure is
progressive in that the cost per ml increases both with incremental co.an-
sumption and with the customers capacity to pay.  Since all customers are
metered, the present structure encourages an efficient use of water. Cus-
tomers with sewerage service pay a 45-55% surcharge over the water bill,
which is consistent with the estimated costs of these services.  EAAB's
tariff structure includes a minimum water allowance of 10 M3 per month at a
cost which makes basic services affordable to the poor (para. 5.08).
4.08      Connection charges account for about 11% of EAAB's operating rev-
enues. They include assessments of around 3% of property values and fees
for the right of service for new water and sewerage connections. The aver-
age charge for water/sewerage connection is Col$35,000  (US$350).   Except
for those customers in the lowest residential tariff category, wbo have fi-
nancing available of up to five years, customers pay connection charges be-
fore the connections are made.
4.09       EAAB's personnel costs account for about 70Z of total operating
costs. Its competitive compensation package has permitted EAAB to attract
and retain qualified staff, and tbus consistently improve productivity.
Salaries in real terms, nevertheless, outgrew productivity substantially
during 1980-84 due to political pressure from EAAB's unions. During this
period, personnel costs increased at an average annual rate of 6% in real
terms, causing personnel costs per ml of water sold in 1984 prices to
increase from US$0.124 in 1980 to US$0.157 in 1984.  EAAB's goal in the
future is to keep salary increases in real terms in line with increases in
productivity. To protect EAABTs financing plan, maintenance of personnel
costs per .3 in real terms at 1984 levels is included in the Plan of Action



-25-
(Annex 5) and EAAB agreed during negotiations to review its financial
projections following any action, including a new wage and benefit
agreement with its labor unions, which would result in an increase in its
operating costs in excess of the increase in the consumer price Index for
the corresponding period (para. 4.17).
4.10      Mainly because of loans obtained to finance cost overruns and the
accelerated devaluation of the Colombian peso, EAAB's debt service obliga-
tions including the proposed loan would have caused EAAB to exceed by about
40% a 0.2 maximum debt-service/revenue ratio established by the Bogota Dis-
trict Council for all its semi-autonomous companies. This limit would have
unduly restricted EAAB beyond what its financial security requires and
would have impaired its ability to meet the demand for services. EAAB has
obtained a waiver from the Bogota District Planning Department in
accordance with the Council's act.   During negotiations, EAAB confirmed
the existence of the waiver. EAAB, nevertheless, needs to limit new debts
and nonpriority investments to protect the financing plan for the project
and other identified investment priorities.  A limitation on new debt and
investments other than the project would he covenanted (para. 4.16).
4.11       One aspect of EAAB's finances resolved since appraisal was the
sbaring of costs for the Chingaza project with EEEB.9/ The signing of a
cost sharing agreement between the two agencies has been a concern of the
Bank since 1978.   Although no major variations are expected from the
estimated long-terr receivable for EAAB as a result of the settlement
(about Col$7,000 million), the settlement would further ensure the
stability of EAAB's financing plan during project execution.
EAAB's Overall Financial Plan and Investment Program
4.12       During project execution (1985-92), EAAB plans total investments
equivalent to about US$587 million in current prices of which US$354 mil-
lion, including capitalized interest, are for the Bank-financed project
(para. 3.18).  The remaining US$233 million to he invested during project
execution are for:
(a)  the provision of water, sewerage and drainage services for
the Cuidad Bolivar Urban Development Project and neighboring
areas (assisted by the IDB);
(b)  some water and sewerage secondary networks and minor main-
tenance investments; and
(c)  canal and interceptor construction which would he carried
out mainly after 1990.
91  EEEB uses water from the Chingaza project to generate power.  EEEB
agreed to participate in the cost of the Cbingaza project before
construction began and made a one-time contribution based on the
original cost estimate whicb was substantially less than the final
cost. EEEB has agreed to increase its contribution to the project
based on a joint EAAB-EEEB study of the costs and benefits wbich was
completed in 1982.



-26-
External financing under the proposed project would provide 30% of total
requirements (para. 3.19). The Bank would also provide about US$2 million
under Loan 1697-CO.  IDB would provide an additional 3% (US$18 million).
Contributions from developers, customer and other entities (US$71 million)
are estimated to cover 12% of requirements during the period. EAAB would
provide the remaining US$317 million (54% of total requirements) from its
internal cash generation. A detailed financing plan is presented in Annex
12.
Financial Projections
4.13       Financial projections for EAAB for the years 1985-93, indicate
EAAB will need inter alia to:
(a) gradually increase tariffs in real terms by 15% between
1985-89;
(b) reduce unaccounted-for water from 40% to 26% by 1990;
(c) reduce the staff/1000 connection ratio from 4.9 to 4.5 by
1990; and
(d) control operating costs, especially those for personnel.
Selected data from EAAB's projected income and cash flow statements and key
financial  indicators  are  shown  in  Table  4.2.        Detailed  financial
statements, as well as the assumptions on which they are based, are
presented in Annex 12.
4.14      EAAB's financial performance is projected to improve substantial-
ly during project execution.  To enable EAAB to finance the proposed in-
vestment program, its rates of return would grow from 3.5% in 1985 and
1986, to 4.0% in 1987, 4.5% in 1988 and remain at this level thereafter.
The debt-service coverage ratio would vary between 1.5 and 2.6 between
1985-1993.  During this period, the current ratio would be above 3.  The
debt/debt plus equity ratio would reach a maximum of 25 in 1985 and drop to
about 11 in 1993.
Financial Covenants
4.15       Consistent with the financial requirements of EAAB's investment
needs, assurances were obtained from EAAB during negotiations that it would
achieve a rate of return on revalued fixed assets not lower than 3.5X in
1985 and 1986, 4% in 1987 and 4.5% in 1988 and thereafter and that it would
annually adjust its level of revalued fixed assets according to the
consumer price index (indice al consumidor obrero) published by the
Government.
4.16       So that the Bank can comment on its proposed investments other
than the project and monitor its financial performance, assurances were
obtained from EAAB during negotiations that it would send to the Bank
before October 31 each year a five year investment plan and financial

projection, including the current fiscal year,for the Bank's review and
comment. To protect EAAB's financing plan, assurances were obtained from
EAAB during negotiations that it would not without the Bank's consent: (a)
incur any long-term debt that would cause its forecasted debt service
during any fiscal year to fall below 1.5 times its forecasted net revenues;
and (b) undertake nor commit itself to undertake investments (other than
those included in the project) which are not economically and financially
justified, not part of its investment program (other than investments of
less  than US$3.0 million equivalent) and not supported by appropriate
financir.g.
4.17      Using the latest financial projection agreed upon with the Bank,
EAAB would be expected to review its compliance with the rate of return
covenant by October 31 each year and whenever there is an expected increase
in its operating costs in the coming 12 months in excess of the expected
increase in the consumer price index for the corresponding period.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that EAAB would undertake
these reviews and based on the results, take measures necessary, including
the adjustments of its tariffs to maintain its compliance with the
covenanted rates of return.
4.18        The agreements of the three pre':ious loans to EAAB would be
amended by the proposed loan so that the financial covenants of all the
Bank's outstanding loans to EAAB are consistent.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.19       During negotiations EAAB confirmed that the proposed monitoring
indicators (Annex 14) reflect the expected improvements in EAAB's
operations, while the construction and disbursement schedules represent
forecasts of implementation  progress.   EAAB would submit to the Bank
semi-annual reports (due February 28 and August 31) on the progress of
project implementation and its operating and financial performance during
the preceding semester ending December 31 and June 30.  The reports would
measure performance against the monitoring indicators and construction and
disbursement schedules.

V. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
General
5.01       The proposed project is fully justified in economic terms as it
represents the expanded use of existing capacity, yields relatively high re-
turns and improves efficiency through the rehabilitation of infrastructure.
The project also has a high social impact in that 54% of the beneficiaries
would be urban poor who would be provided a dependable water supply at af-
fordable rates. The results of the economic and social analysis of the pro-
ject are described below. The calculations are presented in Annex 15.
Least-Cost Solution
5.02         The project components  represent the least-cost  solution  for
achieving the desired benefits (Annex 4).  Most of the components represent
extensions and/or rehabilitation of existing systems and will be constructed
according to existing and proven design standards.
Rates of Return, Long-Run Marginal Costs and Tariffs
5.03         Economic rates of return (ERRs) have been calculated for the
various project components and for the total project both with and without
sunk costs.  Assumptions and details of the analyses are described in Annex
15. The estimated ERR for the water supply component (86% of project cost)
is 12%, and for the sewerage and drainage component (6% of project cost)
23%10/, yielding a weighted rate of return of 13% for 92% of the project
cost.    When  sunk  costs  related  to  the  Chingaza  production  facilities
constructed under Loan 741-CO are taken into consideration, the ERR of the
project lowers from 13% to 8% because of the very high cost of these
facilities (para. 2.10).  Despite this low ERR, the Chingaza project still
represents the least-cost solution for meeting Bogota's water supply needs.
The San Rafael reservoir by itself (18% of project cost) has a ERR of 10%.
Its main purpose is to allow routine inspection and maintenance of the
Chingaza tunnel, thus decreasing the risk of a tunnel failure which would
result in a major disruption in the supply of water to the city.   This
benefit has not been quantified.  ERRs were not computed for the technical
assistance, studies, and the purchase of maintenance equipment because the
benefits of these components can not be quantified reliably.   The cost of
these items is, however, small, equalling only 8% of total project cost. All
costs  are  expressed  in  January  1985  prices  and  include  engineering,
administration and physical contingencies and are cxclusive of taxes and
custom duties.
5.04      The ERRs were calculated using revenues from consumer charges as a
proxy for the economic benefits of the project. As in all water supply and
sewerage projects, the full economic impact cannot be evaluated since many
benefits such as improvement of public health and hygiene and enhanced pro-
perty values cannot be quantified reliably and therefore are excluded from
the ERR calculations. The consumer surplus is excluded from the calculations
also. As a result, the ERRs are understated. Revenues were calculated using
covenanted tariffs held constant in January 1985 prices. The calculated ERRs
indicate that the project is fully justified in economic terms.
10/ The sewerage and drainage components are considered together because they
largely serve the same areas and complement each other in terms of
effects.



-30-
5.05      Long-run marginal costs for water and sewerage were calculated sep-
arately using the Average Incremental Cost (AIC) method (Annex 15) with an
11% discount rate. All costs are expressed in January 1985 prices. In both
cases, non-tariff revenues (connection and right of service fees) were de-
ducted from total costs, so that the resulting AICs are comparable to tariffs
in evaluating pricing and resource  allocation.   The AIC for water was
estimated to be Col$22.4/m3 ll/ which is lower than the projected average
1989 tariff levels expressed En January 1985prices of about Col$24.5/m3. The
highest two residential consumption blocks are presently levied tariffs of
Col$37.4 and 53.4/m3, respectively, for consumption of 20 m3 and an average
of Col$32.0 and 34.0/m3 for consumption in excess of 20 m3.  The AIC for
sewerage is Col$7.8/m3 which is substantially lower than the projected
average tariff for 1989 in real terms of about Cal$12.2/m3.   Details and
assumptions for the calculation of these AICs are in Annex 15. The fact that
the financial rates of return during the project implementation period seem
low even though tariffs are high (3.5% to4.5%) is due to the large sunk costs
in water production capacity included in EAAB's asset base. EAAB's current
production  capacity  is sufficient  until  the year  2005.    To  serve  new
customers, EAAB need only invest in distribution.
Beneficiaries and Impact on the Urban Poor
5.06       Direct benefits of the water supply component of the project would
accrue to about 2.1 million people by the end of 1992.  Beneficiaries would
include about 1.0 million people, who would receive water services and about
1.1 million existing consumers whose services would be upgraded in quantity
a-nd quality through elimination of supply interruptions. By the end of 1992,
the project would serve about 0.8 million more people with sewerage and
drainage than at present.   The impact of the project will continue to in-
crease as complementary works are completed.
5.07       The direct impact of the project on the poverty group, defined as
families earning a monetary income of less than Col$24,000 in September 1984
prices, 12/ was estimated by calculating the proportion of urban poor in the
total incremental population served by each project component. About 54% of
water supply beneficiaries would be the urban poor. The number of urban poor
with water connections will rise from 1.1 million in 1985 to 1.6 million in
1992, with the share connected rising from 79Z to 93%. All of the benefici-
aries of the sewerage and drainage works would be the urban poor. As a re-
sult of the project, the number of poor with sewerage will rise from 0.9 mil-
lion to 1.1 million, with the share connected rising from 63% to 66% during
1985-92.   An estimated 60% of  the project  cost will benefit  the poor.
Affordability of Project Services
5.08       An evaluation of the affordability of water supply and sewerage
services was made based on 1984 tariffs under the current tariff structure
(Annex 15).  The low income consumers are subsidized by high volume, commer-
cial and industrial consumers.   In 1984, an extremely poor family with a
monthly income of half the poverty threshold (ColS12,000) would have paid
11/ The AIC for water calculated without deducting non-tariff revenues was
Col$28.0/m3 (Annex 15).
12/ On an annual basis, this corresponds to approximately one-third of the
national per capita income.



-31-
about 3.1% of its income for minimum water and sewerage service provided un-
der the project (10 m3/month/account). This percentage includes repayment of
a connection fee and network construction costs with EAAB financing.  When
all one-time charges are repaid in 10 years, a poor family would pay only
0.4% of its income for minimum service.  Assuming that family income increas-
es in line with inflation, only a minor increase in the portion of family in-
come spent on water and sewerage services would result during the rest of the
1980s as tariffs are projected to increase at a rate only slightly higher
than inflation.
Project Sensitivity and Risks
5.09       There is a high degree of certainty that the project will provide
the desired benefits and that it will be implemented properly. The effect of
variations in costs, benefits and implementation delays on the project's
rates of returns has been analyzed (Annex 15).   The analysis demonstrates
that the ERRs are moderately sensitive to changes in costs and benefits.
Revenues are not expected to deviate significantly from those projected since
EAAB has been granted a firm 1.5% monthly tariff increase and the composition
of consumption is expected to result at least as projected.   In addition,
revenue estimates are conservative considering that:  (a) sales per connec-
tion are assumed not to Increase; (b) new connections are based on the lowest
of the forecasted population growth rates; and tc) sales are not dependent on
reductions in unaccounted-for water forecasts.
5.10      Most of the project works are of conventional design and well with-
in the capability of local civil works contractors to construct.  Lessons
learned from problems experienced during the construction of the Chingaza
tunnel (para. 2.10) have been taken into account in the preparations for con-
structing the tunnel included in the proposed project.   Due to its shorter
length, proximity to Bogota and more favorable geological conditions of the
route, the proposed tunnel will be a much simpler undertaking than the Chin-
gaza tunnel. The project tunnel cost estimate, which is based on a detailed
geological investigation of the tunnel route, includes adequate contingen-
cies. The risk that problems similar to those experienced with the Chingaza
tunnel will be repeated is, therefore, minimal.
5.11       The financing plan has minor risks.  There is a risk that EAAB's
internal cash resources might fall short of needs to meet the cost of the
project if efforts to contain operating cost increases are not successful.
Also, there is a slight risk of a shortfall in the export credit financing.
However, if this should occur, it could be minimized by a combinat40n of
alternatives including higher tariffs, government loans, increased commercial
bank financing and a realignment of investment priorities. The worst result
would be a delay in project implementation while new financing is arranged.
To prevent the possibility of a delay in implementation of the high priority
water distribution component (Part A of the project) Bank luan funds would be
made available on a contingent basis for the financing of the pipes in tne
event that appropriate cofinancing is not obtained for this item.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from EAMB that it
would:
(a) carry out the Plan of Action in Annex 5 for institutional
strengthening (paras. 2.09 and 3.17);
(b) take all actions necessary to secure additional financing on
terms satisfactory to the Bank to ensure the timely procure-
ment of the goods and services required for the project
(para. 3.20);
(c) hire consultants satisfactory to the Bank to supervise the
construction of the tunnel in Part A of the project (para.
3.23);
(d)  coordinate the carrying out of the Bogota River implementa-
tion planning study with CAR and the District Planning De-
partment (para. 3.24);
{e) appoint a panel of experts satisfactory to the Bank to review

and arrange for periodic inspections by a qualified engineer
during its operation (para. 3.26);
(f)  earn rates of return on revalued fixed assets of 3.5% in
1985-86; 4.0% in 1987 and 4.5% in 1988 and thereafter (para.
4.15);
(g) not incur any long-term debt that would cause its forecasted
debt service to be coverer; less than 1.5 times by its net
revenues (para. 4.16);
(h) not undertake nor commit itself to undertake investments
(other than those included in the project) which are not
economically and financially justified, not port of its in-
vestment program (other than investments of less than US$3.0
million equivalent) and not supported by appropriate financ-
ing (para. 4.16);
(i) send to the Bank before October 31 in each year for review
and coment an investment plan and financial projections for
the current year and the following four years (para. 4.16);
and



-33-
(k)  review its financial projections on or before October 31 each
year and whenever there is an expected increase in operating
costs in the coming 12 month period in excess of the expected
increase in the consumer price index for the corresponding
period, and based on the results of any such review, take
measures necessary to comply with the covenanted rates of
return (para. 4.17).
6.02     During negotiations, EAAB confirmed that:
(a) a waiver of its debt limit has been obtained from the Bogota
District Planning Department (para. 4.10); and
(b)   it has signed with EEEB a cost sharing agreement for the
Chingaza project defining investment costs, terms of payment
and responsibility for operating costs (para. 4.11).
6.03      In separate negotiations, the Government has provided assurances
that import licenses would be granted by INCOMEX in a timely fashion
(para. 3.30).
6.04      There are no special conditions for effectiveness.
6.05      The proposed Bank loan would include retroactive financing of an
amount not to exceed US$3.0 million equivalent for expeditures incurred
after July 1, 1984.
6.06      With the above assurances, agreements and conditions, the prcpos-
ed project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$129 million to be repaid
over a period of 17 years, which includes five years of grace.

COLOMBIA
FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Institutional Assessment of EAAB
General
1.        EAAB is an autonomous municipal agency responsible for providing
water, sewerage and drainage services to the Special District of Bogota
and Soacha. EAAB's institutional capabilities, although adequate to carry
out the project and expand services, could be further improved to control
costs and better serve its customers. Assessments and recommendations by
management area are provided below.
Institutional Arrangement and Maiagement
2.        Board of Directors and Appointment of Employees.  EAAB, according
to its statute agreed upon between the Special District of Bogota and cred-
itor banks for the period 1955-2001, is governed by a seven-member Board of
Directors, which includes: the Mayor of Bogota (who chairs the Board and
is appointed by the President of Colombia); two representatives of the Bo-
gota District Council; three representatives of creditor banks (one of them
Banco Central Hipotecario, a Government agency); and Banco de la Republica
(Colombia's Central Bank). The Board approves EAAB's organization, annual
budgets, the contracting of debt, investment projects, contract awards and
tariffs.   The contracting of debt (the service of which unless waived
should not exceed 20% of operating revenues according to District resolu-
tion) and investment projects are subject to review by the Bogota Dis-
trict.  Tariffs are subject to approval by the Junta Nacional de Tarifas.
The Mayor alone, according to national legislation, appoints EAAB's General
Manager. The General Manager appoints all EAAB's employees. EAAB's organ-
ization and autonomy, which is similar to that of other large water compan-
ies in Colombian cities, has in general led to satisfactory results.
3.         Managtment.  The present General Manager is a competent adminis-
trator who has the support of the Mayor of Bogota and the Bogota District
Council. The present second level managers are qualified professionals and
familiar with EAAB's operations.
4.          Organization.  Although management has been considering some
changes, EAAB's current organizational structure (Attachment 1) is suitable
for activities during project execution. Present major organizational di-
visions, the heads of which report to the General Manager, are:  Opera-
tions, Technical (engineering and project supervision), Financial, Plann-
ing, Secretariat (includes Legal) and Administrative. The commercial unit



- 35 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2
is an Administrative Division responsibility which includes meter reading
and customer relations. Other commercial related functions are carried out
by the Financial and Operations Divisions.  Management has explored the
possible integration of all commercial activities under an indelandent comr-
mercial division without conclusive results. This would be considered with
the assistance of consultants under the project, in connection with studies
to further improve EAAB's staff efficiency and information and control sys-
tems.
Personnel
5.          Staffing.  EAAB's staff is generally qualified at all levels.
Total staff at appraisal numbered 2,613, of which 170 were professionals,
960 office employees and technicians and 1,483 field laborers.  With 4.9
employees per 1,000 water connections, EAAB compares favorably with water
utilities in developing as well as in industrial countries. EAAB expects,
nevertheless, to reduce this ratio, a measure of water company productiv-
ity, to 4.5 or less during project execution.   This goal is considered
realistic because: production facilities are already fully staffed and new
production facilities will not be required until 2005; engineering and pro-
ject supervision personnel, because of the completion of the Chingaza
project, are already in excess of the numbers required for the proposed
project; telemetering and other technology could further improve the
productivity of personnel working in operations; and better document flows
could further improve the productivity of personnel working in financial,
commercial and other management areas.   Technical assistance would be
provided under the project to assist EAAB in further improving staff
productivity.
6.        Personnel Management.  Adequate.  Employee moral is high.  Up to
the third management level, there is a good opportunity for career growth
and job security, and EAAB pays its employees a competitive compensation
package. Thus, it is able to retain and hire staff of good quality.
7.            Training.  Needis improvement.  EAAB has no formal training
program, although there are opportunities available to take courses at
local universities in the evenings and some Departments provide informal
training on their own.  Training that does exist is considered deficient
for the following reasons: (a)  it doesn't have any impact on efficiency
and productivity; (b) the substance of the courses is obsolete and does not
always correspond to the specific needs of the institution; and (c) not
enough emphasis is given to the professional and technical staff. A major
reason for the weakness of the programs is that training is a collateral
responsibility of the training officer who lacks the authority and means to
execute a training program in accordance with the demand and needs of the
operational and technical units.
Project Planning and Execution, and Operations
8.          Investment Planning.  Adequate.  EAAB prepares its long-range
investment plans with its own staff assisted by consultants.  It chooses
its priorities well,  takiig into account project economic benefits and
prepares good feasibility studies.



-36-
ANNEX 1
Page 3
9.         Financial Planning.  Needs improvement.  Financial planning is
the responsibility of the Financial Manager and coordination with the Plan-
ning Department is poor.   Investment programs included in the financial
projections do not always agree with programs proposed by the Planning Man-
ager. Also, financiaL modeling techniques need improvement. The present
models/methods do not adequately take into account working capital require-
ments, which leads to a time consuming consultation process to obtain reli-
able cash flow projections.   Also, the models are not compatible with
EAAB's accounting and budgeting systems. A financial modelling system cor-
patible with the budget would be introduced under the project through tech-
nical assistance complemented by staff training.
10.       Project Preparation.  Good.  Feasibility studies are the respons-
ibility of the Planning Unit.   Consultants are used for large projects
(distribution system master plan, San Rafael reservoir, etc.). The Techni-
cal Unit is responsible for preparing final designs, contracting of works
and supervisic, of construction. This unit employs consultants to design
large projects but uses its own staff to design works of a routine nature
such as secondary networks. When consultants are used, they are selected
fairly and efficiently and are supervised effectively.
11.        Project Execution.  Good.  Contractors carry out all construct-
ion.  EAAB hires consultants under EAAB's staff supervision to supervise
large construction projects but supervises directly most routine works with
its own staff. In the past it has hired consultants to manage its own per-
sonnel for the supervision and inspection of construction.  The proposed
project is within EAAB's project management capabilities.
Operation and Maintenance
12.       Adequate in most areas.  EAAB's operation and maintenance is well
organized and effective in most areas. Preventive maintenance programs are
in place, reported leaks and pipe breaks are repaired quic'Kly and record
keeping is good.  Only meter maintenance (para. 14) and control of unac-
counted-for water (40% in 1983) remains a problem.  It is suspected that
most of the unaccounted-for water is lost through pipe breaks and under-
registration of meters. The frequency of pipe breaks is abnormally high in
Bogota because of the acidity of the soil which affects asbestos cement
pipes which were installed without proper protection and make up most of
the secondary networks.  Many of the meters in service are over 20 years
old and while EAAB's meter testing and repair facilities are sufficient,
there is no routine meter testing program ln place. Production meters are
few and and these are tested routinely. EAAB recognizes that it has prob-
lems with its customer metering and is now reorganizing its mecer mainten-
ance effort. In view of the overall complexity of the unaccounted-for wa-
ter problem. technical assistance would be provided under the project to
improve EAAB's unaccounted-for water reduction program.
Commercial
13.       Customer File.  Needs improvement.  Illegal connections are esti-
mated at about 3% of legal connections, a low percentage compared to



~ 37 -                    ANNEX 1
Page 4
other large Colombian and Latin American cities. However, procedures for
obtaining a service connection are complicated and time consuming. Simpli-
fication of the new connection application procedure and reduction of the
time between the receipt of a request and the installation of a new con-
nection would help to eliminate one cause of illegal connections. EAAB
keeps the customer file of its legal connections current, and the inform-
ation provided by this file is sufficient for customer service and bill
collection.
14.         Metering.   Needs improvement.   Coverage is adequate, however,
meter maintenancerequires improvement. A recent survey indicated that 15%
of all installed meters were not functioning.  Also, there is no routine
testing program in place to insure meter accuracy. Under registration of
meters could be responsible for a significant percentage of the
unaccounted-for water.
15.         Billing.  Needs improvement.  EAAB's computer center prepares
bimonthly billings with an average reading-billing lag of one month, which
could be improved. Procedures could be simplified and made more efficient
with new data processing equipment.
16.         Collections.   Good.  Customers pay in EAAB's offices, and in
Banks within ten days after bills are issued. EAAB charges a 2Z monthly
interest on accounts one month overdue, and disconnects the service on ac-
counts 45 days overdue.   Outstanding bills are kept below two months of
billings. Procedures could be simplified.
Management Information and Control Systems
17.        Management Reporting.  Needs improvement.  EAAB prepares finan-
cial statements, budget compliance repo ts, some technical indicators
monthly and a detailed statistical repor._ annually.   These reports and
diverse records some units keep provide substantial information. However,
this information is not presented in a meaningful way for management to
monitor operating and investment performance and take timely corrective
actions. Consultants under the project would assist EAAB in implementing
an improved management information and reporting system.
18.         Accounting System.  Needs improvement.  EAAB could streamline
procedures and integrate financial accounting systems to reduce the
workload.    It  could  also  introduce  a  simple  cost  accounting  system
(compatible with financial accounting and the reporting/budgeting systems)
to monitor controllable costs and identify separately water and sewerage
costs.   Consultants under the project would assist EAAB in introducing
these improvements.
19.        Fixed Asset Accounting and Control.  Adequate.  Work in progress
is incorporated promptly, when completed, to the asset base. EAAB has in-
dividual records of fixed assets.  It revalues the total balances of fixed
assets annually following a satisfactory methodology. EAAB does not carry
the revaluation on its books but prepares financial statements on a reval-
ued basis.



- 38 -
ANNEX 1
Page 5
20.       Budgeting System.  Needs improvement.  While the budgeting system
works well to monitor compliance with Board of Directors authorization and
Bogota District regulations, it provides information of limited use for
management  control.    Taking  into  account  compliance  with  District
regulations, consultants under the project would devise a budget system
which would be more useful as a management and planning tool and compatible
with the accounting system.
21.       Electronic Data Processing.  Needs improvement.  EAAB's billings,
payroll, fixed assets, inventories, accounts payable and general accounting
are computerized.   EAAB has its own staff of analysts, programners and
operators but shares a computer facility with EEEB.   Improvements in the
areas of financial and cost accounting, budgeting, and integration among
systems will require additional systems and programming work. EAAB's staff
is prepared to undertake most of these tasks with some assistance from
consultants.   Considering the expansion of EAAB's operations,  the loan
would include funds to purchase a computer.
22.           Internal Auditing.   Adequate.   As is standard practice in
Colombia for municipally owned agencies, the office of the District
Controller performs this function. The District auditors assigned to EAAB
(76 auditors on EAAB's payroll - 3% of EAAB's staff) concentrate in the
detailed review of transactions (prior control) while they are in process,
rather than in ensuring that EAAB's internal controls work.   While the
prior control is costly, it ensures that transactions are properly
authorized and recorded. It is not realistic to expect that the District
audit would be streamlined and refocused in the near future.
Insurance
23.       Adequate.  EAAB carries fire and casualty insurance on buildings,
stocks and equipment subject to those risks, and third party liability for
selected risk exposures. Because of the cost of coverage, EAAB relies for
other risks (dam failure, pipe bursts) on security measures to control
their occurrence.

COLOMBIA
FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Bogota's Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Systems
General
1.         Bogota has a modern water supply system which serves 95% of the
population with metered connections.  The remainder of the population is
served by public standpipes connected to the distribution system, trucked
water, systems which store rainwater, shallow wells and small streams.
There are four water supply systems with full treatment which account for
99% of the total supply capacity. The Bogota River and its tributaries are
the source of supply for three of the systems. A tunnel diversion from the
Chingaza area is the source of supply for the fourth and newest system.
The remaining supply capacity (less than 1%) consists of small intakes
located in the hills to the east of the city.  Water from these sources
receive chlorination only.
2.        The city has both sanitary and storm water drainage systems with-
in the boundaries of an established sanitary district.  The systems are
separate except in the area of the old city where they are combined. Sew-
age is discharged without treatment into the Bogota River and its tributar-
ies.
Water Supply System
3.         The principal water supply systems and their capacities are as
follows:
Production
Capacity
System                           (m3/sec)
Tibito                               12.0
Chingaza                             14.0
Tunjelo/San Cristobal                 1.5
La Laguna                             0.3
San Francisco                         0.1
Other (chlorination only)          negligible
TOTAL                            27.9



-41-
ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.         The Tibito system obtains a major part of its water from an in-
take on the Bogota River, 35 km north of the city and upstream of the sec-
tion where industrial and domestic wastes pollute the River. The River at
the intake is partially regulated by three reservoirs in the upper river
basin with storage totalling 900 million m3. These reservoirs belong to and
are operated by EEEB and CAR, but a joint commission of EAAB, EEEB and CAR
coordinates the releases according to the needs of the three entities. Wa-
ter is also diverted from the Teusaca River to the treatment plant at
Tibito. Water from the Chingaza system can reach the Tibito plant through
releases to the Teusaca River upstream of the plant.   The combined safe
yield of the Bogota River sources is 10 m3/sec. The use of water from the
Teusaca River and Chingaza is limited by the 5 m3/sec capacity of a pumping
station used to lift water from the Teusaca River to the intake of the
plant.
5.        The Tibito water treatment plant provides flocculation, sedimen-
tation and filtration. The plant was originally designed for 4.0 m3/sec.
Between 1972-76 the capacity was increased to 12 m3/sec by adding only new
flocculation and sedimentation capacity, replacing the sand in the existing
filter basins with dual filter media (anthracite and sand) and introducing
more efficient operating procedures.
6.         Two raw water pumping stations pump water from the Bogota River
to the plant and a third raw water pumping station (maximum capacity of 5
m;3sec) pumps water from the Teusaca River. The treated water can either
flow by gravity from the filter well through parallel 60 and 78-in. pipe-
lines to the city or it can be pumped to a treated water reservoir at
Tibito and then flow to the city through the same pipelines.   The 60-in.
pipeline terminates at the Usaquen pumping station in the city. The 78-in.
line transmits its water to the southwest end of the city and terminates at
the Casa Blanca storage tank. The combined capacity of both pipelines with
water released from the treated water reservoir is 15.0 m3lsec.
7.         The Tunjuelo supply system is an all-gravity system which draws
water from the Regadera reservoir on the Tunjuelo River, 25 km south of the
city.   Water from the reservoir Is treated at two separate treatment
plants: one at Vitelma with a capacity of 1.2 m3/sec and at a plant called
La Laguna located near Usme with a capacity of 0.35 m3/sec.  Both treatment
plants are directly connected to the distribution system and serve the high
lying areas along the eastern city limits.
8.         The San Cristobal, San Francisco and other minor intakes on the
hills east of the city are of little significance compared to the Tibito,
Chingaza and Tunjuelo systems.   The San Cristobal supply is connected by
gravity to the Vitelma treatment plant; however, when turbidities are low,
the water is fed directly to the system with chlorination only.  The San
Francisco system has its own small treatment plant located at San Diego.
The other systems which serve isolated high lying sections of the city are
provided with chlorination as the only means of treatment.



-42-
ANNEX 2
Page 3
9.         The Chingaza system has a capacity of 14 m3/sec.  Its main fea-
ture is the diversion of water from the Chingaza water shed 40 km east of
Bogota through a series of tunnels and conduits.  The system also diverts
an average of 1 m3/sec of uncontrolled flow from the Blanco River.  The
principal components of the Chingaza system are: (a) a dam and 200 million
m3 reservoir on the Chuza River above its confluence with the Guatiquia
River; (b) a 45 km conveyance system between the Chuza Reservoir and Bogota
consisting primarily of tunnels with an average diameter of 3.7 m; (c) the
Weisner water treatment plant at El Sapo with a capacity of 14 M3/sec
expandable to 22 m3/sec in the future; (d) 100 km of access roads; (e) a
run of the river diversion from the Guatiquia River which consists of a
3.5 km tunnel from the Guatiquia River to the Chuza Reservoir and related
intake works; and (f) a run of the river diversion from the Blanco River
which enters the main diversion tunnel through three vertical drop shafts.
Treated water from the Wiesner plant flows by gravity through a short tun-
nel and pipe system to the Santa Ana storage tank at Usaquen and from the
storage tank to the distribution system through a 2 km 60-in. main.
Water Distribution
10.       The city is divided into three distribution pressure zones (low,
intermediate, and high). The low zone supplied by the Tibito and Wiesner
treatment plants is by far the largest, serving about 70X of the city's
area.   The intermediate zone forms a narrow band between the two other
zones and supplies approximately 10% of the city area. It is connected to
the Parque Nacional tank which receives its water from the Tibito and Wies-
ner water treatment plants by a booster pumping station at Usuaquen. The
high zone, representing about 20% of the city area, is supplied by the
Vitelma, San Diego and Laguna treatment plants.
11.       The total length of distribution system pipe is 4,500 km, includ-
ing the two transmission lines from the Tibito treatment plant.   Pipes
range in size from 3 to 78-in. The majority of the pipes (94%) are 14-in.
and smaller. Commonly used pipe materials are galvanized iron for diame-
ters 3-in. and smaller, asbestos cement for diameter 4 to 12-in. and pre-
stressed concrete for pipes 24-in. and larger. Recently, PVC pipe has been
used in sizes below 12-in. and ductile iron pipe has been used in place of
asbestos cement pipe for diameters of 12 to 42-in.
12.        Distribution storage capacity totals 334,000 m3.  The major part
of this capacity is located in the low pressure zone. The largest tank in
the system is the Casa Blanca storage tank with a capacity of 140,000 m3.

Sewerage and Drainage Systems
13.       About 30% of the area of Bogota, the older part of the city,has a
combined sewerage and storm water drainage system.   The rest of city is
served by separate systems. These systems, including the combined systems
serving the older part of the city, are divided into four main sectors.
Each sector corresponds  to the drainage basin of the following small
streams which are tributaries to the Bogota River:  Torca, Salitre, Fucha
and Tunjueio. The sewerage and drainage master plan provides for the cana-
lization of these streams and the construction of parallel sanitary inter-
ceptors to collect all sewage discharges. At the present time, there is 50
km of completed canals with 70 km of tributary remaining to be lined. At
present, there is no sewage treatment.

FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Population, Po ulation Served and Water Demand in the Project Area
Population
1.        Bogota's average 1983 population is estimated to be 4.3 million,
accounting for about 15% of the total population of Colombia and 24% of the
urban population.   The basis for the current estimates is a statistical
anaylsis prepared by the National Statistical Agency (DANE) in 1978. The
last complete census was carried out in 1973.   Between 1973 and 1978,
Bogota's population grew at an annual rate of 5.8% primarily reflecting
heavy immigration from the rural areas.   The current growth  rate is
estimated at 3.6% per annum.  Projections of future population growth have
been prepared by a number of agencies in recent years.  These projections
include the official government estimate prepared by the National
Department of Planning (DIP) in 1978, the CCRP/EAAB study estimates
prepared in 1980 and a Department of Transportation estimate prepared in
1979.  The year 2000 population projected by these studies varies from a
low of 6.9 million to a high of 7.5 million.
2.         The above estimates apply only to the Special District of Bogo-
ta. At the present time, BAkB provides retail water service to an estimat-
ed population of 58,000 in Soacha, a rapidly growing area to the southwest
of Bogota and bulk water to an estimated population of 30,000 in nearby
communities of Chia and Cajica.  Although there are no plans at present,
EAAB has the potential to serve other nearby towns with a combined
population of 200,000.
3.          Separate projections have been made for retail and bulk custo-
mers.   The service area for retail customers was assumed to include the
Special District of Bogota and Soacha. Projections of the potential popu-
lation for bulk water sales by EAAB includes the communities it presently
serves and communities which could be extended service at relatively minor
cost. Bulk and retail area population projections are given in Attachment
1.  The retail service area population projections are based on the low



-45-                  ANNEX 3
Page 2
CCRP/EAAB estimates for the Special District of Bogota. Population projec-
tions for Soacha are based on a DNP sponsored planning study prepared in
1982. Population projections for the communities receiving bulk water ser-
vice now and potentially in the future are the official projections of the
Population Division of DNP.
Population Served and Service Standards
4.         At the end of 1983, EAAB serviced 518,000 water accounts through
540,000 water connections.   The population served by direct connections
based on 8 persons per account was 4,144,000 or 95W of the estimated total
population. Another 5,000 persons are estimated to be served through 50
standpipes. The population receiving bulk water from EAAB is estimated at
30,000. Those individuals within the District's sanitary perimeter, butnot
legally connected to the EAAB system or served by standpipe, obtain water
from private wells or illegal connections.   The sanitary perimeter is a
legal boundary established by the Bogota District Council.
5.         From about 1976-82, EAAB's supply fully met the demands of con-
nected customers and provided a highly reliable 24 hour-a-day service. Be-
ginning in 1982, restrictions in the distribution network have resulted in
water shortages in the southwest area of the city which affects approxima-
tely 200,000 persons at present.
6.         About 88% of Bogota's population is served by direct connections
to EAAB's sewerage system. The remainder of the population, located mainly
outside the sanitary district perimeter, is served by septic tanks, private
or community storm drains or latrines. At the end of 1983, EAAB serviced
479,000 sewage accounts through 499,000 sewage connections.
Composition of Sales
7.          About 66% of EAAB's water sales are to residential customers,
27% to comnercial and industrial customers and 7% to government.   Unac-
counted-for water use, the difference between production and water sales,
was 402 of production in 1983. During the past 10 years, unaccounted-for
water has ranged from a low of 20% in 1978 to a high of 40% in 1983. The
division of sales between residential, commercial and industrial and gov-
ernment has remained about the same over this period.
Past Water Sales and Production Per Account
8.        In 1983, monthly water sales per account was 39 m3 and production
per account was 66 m3.   Water sales do not include water distributed
through standpipes which are unmetered.  During the past 10 years, water
sales per account has declined from a high in 1975 of 52 m3/per/month.



-46-                   ANNEX 3
Page 3
This decline is explained by a decrease in the number of persons per
household, the incorporation of low income consumers, by substantial tariff
increases in real terms (about 35% during 1977-84) and more recently by
restrictions in the distribution system.    Production per account has
declined from a high 72 m3/per/month to 66 m3/per/month over the same
period. The year by year values based on data from EAAB's records are as
follows:

a/ Based on retail sales only.
b/ Includes bulk water sales.
Water Sales and Production Prolections
9.        Separate projections have been prepared for retail and bulk water
sales. Projected retail water sales have been derived from expected popu-
lation growth, EAAB's capacity to install new service connections, an as-
sessment of the market for new connections and assumptions regarding water
sales per account. The market assessment gave consideration to projects in
the planning and implementing stages which will provide the primary dis-
tribution necessary for the development in new areas. Per capita consump-
tion was not used since the population served and the number of persons
served per account are at best only estimates, and therefore do not lend
themselves to precise monitoring. Projections for increases in bulk water
sales have been based on a potential population that could be served within
a close proximity to Bogota, consideration of the availability of local
supplies, a per capita requirement of 100 lpd for the population served and
a steady increase in the percent served until the year 2000 when a 95% ser-
vice level is assumed to be reached. The bulk water sales projection rep-
resents more of an allowance than a projection based on historical data.
Whether or not the communities close to Bogota are extended service by EAAB
is influenced  primarily by political decisions at both the national and



-47-
ANNEX 3
Page 4
local level.   As a result, projections are subject to a high degree of
speculation.   However, this is not a serious problem since in the year
2006, when the projections indicate the need for additional production
capacity, bulk water sales represent only 9% of total sales (3X in 1992).
10.         Production requirements are based and water sales projections
plus an allowance for unaccounted-for water. Beginning in 1990, the allow-
ance is 26Z. Reductions in unaccounted-for water are assumed to reduce wa-
ter production and have no effect on water sales.
11.        Past projections of water sales and production requirements in
Bogota have consistently been overstated. The reasons are as follows:
(a) projection of high population growth rates which have not
materialized;
(b) assumption that per capita or per connection consumption
would continue to increase; and
(c) assumption that reductions in unaccounted-for water would be
translated into increased sales rather than reductions in
production requirements (reason for water sales being over-
stated).
The projections for this project are based on conservative assumptions with
regard to population, unit consumption and the results of efforts to reduce
unaccounted-for water.
12.       Historical and projected water sales and production requirements,
including significant indicators used in the projections are included in
Attachment 2.
Adequacy of Existing Production Capacity
13.        Projected productlon requirements and available supply are pre-
sented graphically in Attachment 3. Available production capacity should
be compared to the maximum day requirements which based on past experience
is equal to about 15% of the average production requirement in Bogota.
Based on these projections, EAAB supply capacity of 25.6 m3/sec will be
sufficient to meet the projected maximum daily demand until the year 2005.
Sewage Service Level Projections
14.        Sewerage service levels in the district are only 88X as opposed
to 95% population served with water. Sewerage service levels are expected
to increase in the future so that by the end of the project, 91% of the
population  will  have  sewerage  service.    This  increase  is  considered
reasonable in light of the fact that in the last five years EAAB has
installed 50% more sewerage connections than water connections and its
current backlog of requests for new sewerage services is twice that of the
requests  for  water.        Historical  and  projected  sewerage  service
requirements, including all relative indicators,are listed in Attachment
4.   Data for 1983 and earlier are actual data based on EAAB's records.

FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Project Description
General
1.        The proposed project includes the high priority construction com-
ponents in EAAB's 1985-92 investment program. Also included is technical
assistance for the institutional improvement of EAAB and technical assist-
ance to advance the preparation of the Bogota River Flood and Water
Pollution Control Project, including final design of a water pollution
control plant.
Water Transmission and Distribution Improvements (Part A)
2.        At present, low pressures are being experienced by about 200,000
persons living in the southwest area of Bogota. In addition, the available
capacity of the Chingaza project (Loan 741-CO) cannot be fully utilized be-
cause of restricted transmission capacity from the Santa Ana distribution
reservoir at Usaquen which stores treated Chingaza project water.    Low
pressures are also being experienced by persons living on the fringes of
the city and there is pressure on EAAB to extend services beyond these
areas to accommodate new development.   This part of the project would
address these problems by constructing transmission and distribution mains
adequate to meet projected demands for 1995. The most needed improvement
is a major conveyance from the Santa Ana reservoir across the city to the
existing Casa Blanca reservoir located in the southwest. This conveyance
would consist of 8.5 km of rock tunnel from a point just upstream from the
Santa Ana reservoir to the vicinity of an existing distribution storage
tank in the Parque Nacional.   From this point,  15 km of 48-in. high
pressure express main would take water directly to the Casa Blanca tank. A
60-in. branch main at Parque Nacional would supply water to the existing
San Diego reservoir and eliminate the need for an existing pumping station
which now supplies this reservoir. The tunnel/pipe combination costs the
same as an all pipe alternative but was selected on the basis that its
construction would be less disruptive to the flow of traffic and would give
EAAB greater flexibility in operating the system.



-53-
ANNEX 4
Page 2
3.        The other primary distribution system improvements include system
reinforcements, mostly on the fringes of the system where the greatest
growth of the city is taking place. Also included are six pumping stations
and five storage tanks necessary to increase the supply of water to the
high zone located in the southeast area of the city, another high growth
area. All of the tanks and four of the pumping stations would be additions
to existing facilities.
4.          The proposed distribution mains, pumping stations and storage
tanks included in Part A of the project are listed in Atta.bment 1.  The
locations are shown on the project map.  The basis for the improvements iR
the master plan prepared in 1984 by a consortium of Estudios Tecuicos
Ltda., of Bogota, CosRorcio Nacional de Engenheiros Consultores, S.A. of
Sao Paulo, Brazil and Salgado, Melendes & Asociados of Bogota.
Distribution System Rehabilitation (Part B)
5.        In 1983, EAAB experienced 9,300 main breaks.  A comparable sized
water system in the US would experience about 1,000 main breaks in the same
period.  Most of EAAB's main breaks occur in asbestos cement (AC) pipe.
About 30Z of the breaks are circular (around the circumference of the pipe)
and 70% are blowouts or holes in the pipe.  The circular breaks indicate
beam action taking place and the possible lack of a uniform bedding under
the pipe, a condition resulting from poor construction practices.   The
blowouts are the result of pipe deterioration. The soil in the Bogota area
is reportedly very acid (pH of 5.5 or less) and is the suspected cause of
the AC pipe deterioration. Similar deterioration has been noted with cast
iron valves and small diameter galvanized iron pipe in the system.  EAAB
has taken appropriate measures to prevent further deterioration in the
future but will coutinue to have the problem of repairing a large number of
breaks an replacing pipe beyond repair for the next several years. Under
this part of the project, the Bank would finance the cost of materials and
part of the replacement and repair work performed by private contractors.
6.        EAAB also repairs about 100 leaks each year detected by its pito-
meter section.   Under Part E of the project, the leak detection effort
would be greatly increased and the number of repairs required along with
it. Bank loan funds would be used to purchase repair materials and finance
in part the hiring of contractors to meet the increased repair needs of
EAAB.
7.        During the past three years, EAAB has experienced five breaks in
the 78-in. Tibito-Casa Blanca transmission main constructed under Loan 536-
CO.  This pipeline was constructed with prestressed concrete pipe.   The
failures have resulted from corrosion of the prestressing wires used in the



-54-
ANNEX 4
Page 3
manufacture of this type of pipe. EAAB is hopeful that with an investiga-
tive procedure reconmended by a panel of experts who met in Bogota in Feb-
ruary 1984 to study the problem, the locations of the pipe subject to de-
terioration can be located and repaired. Eventually, the whole main would
have to be replaced if this procedure is not successful. Included in this
part of the projett are funds to be used towards the rehabilitation of this
main based on the results of the survey now in progress.
Secondary Water Networks and Service Connections in Low Income Neigh-
borhoods (Part C)
8.        There are a number of areas inside the sanitary district boundary
of Bogota which developed without the construction of a water, sewerage and
drainage system. EAAB has in place a program whereby communities can apply
to EAAB for financing and installation of the required systems. A com-
munity desiring a system makes application to EAAB committing the persons
to be served to a 15% down payment on the cost of the system. Once the
agreement is signed, EAAB prepares a design and makes a cost estimate.The
construction starts as soon as a community makes the 15% down payment. Pay-
ment of the remaining 85% begins as soon as the system is complete and is
billed to each individual property owner benefitting from the system.
Repayment terms are ten years at 12% interest.
9.        The project includes 140 km of water main, 280 km of sewage col-
lectors and 420 km of storm water drain.   Also included is the cost of
installing about 100,000 water and sewerage services under the same
program. The lengths of pipe to be installed under the project are based
on EAAB's experience with the program over the last several years since
networks are built in response to applications by communities. Communities
requiring systems are usually identified about a year in advance of a
construction start. Therefore, the project includes no specific locations
for the construction of these networks.
10.       Secondary networks constructed under this program represent about
20% of the networks constructed each year. The remaining 80% are built by
private developers and donated to EAAB after their completion.
11.         The project also includes the installation and replacement of
about 260,000 water meters, in addition to 40,000 new meters installed on
new water connections in low-income areas.    Acquisition of tubing and
fittings for new connections is also included in the project.
Raw Water Storage (Part D)
12.       This part of the project includes the construction of the San Ra-
fael reservoir which would provide raw water storage for the new Wiesner
water treatment plant when the Chingaza tunnel, the plant's only source of
supply, is out of service for inspection and maintenance.   The reservoir
would consist of 50 million m3 of water storage in a natural depression
located near the Wiesner plant on land already owned by EAAB. It would be
filled with excess water from the Chuza reservoir and unregulated flows



-55-
ANNEX 4
Page 4
from the Blanco and Teusaca Rivers.   Unregulated flows from the Blanco
River are already being diverted to the Wiesner plant through the Chingaza
tunnel.    Diversion of flows from the Teusaca River will require the
construction of new facilities. A pumping station would be constructed to
pump the water from the reservoir to the plant.  The proposed reservoir
design and location is the least-cost solution for providing the needed
storage.
13.        The San Rafael reservoir had been considered in the late fifties
for its water supply potential, and during the appraisal of the Loan
741-CO, it was included in the master plan for the Chingaza project as the
fifth and final stage. A decision to advance the construction of the San
Rafael reservoir to an earlier stage was made shortly after the start of
construction of  the  Chingaza project.    The  original  Chingaza design
included a concrete lined tunnel. Later, a proposal by consultants to use
a much less expensive but weaker gunite lining and construct immediately
the San Rafael reservoir to provide a standby source of supply from storage
was accepted. The gunite lining with raw water storage was determined to
be the least-cost solution when compared to a concrete lined tunnel without
raw water storage. A tunnel failure which caused a shutdown for fifteen
months after only five months of operation resulted from the continuec
operation  of  the  tunnel  after  the  first  sign  of  a  problem.    The
availability of the San Rafael reservoir would have permitted an immediate
shutdown and the implementation of corrective measures while the problem
was still small and manageable.
14.         The quantifiable benefits of the San Rafael reservoir are (i)
sustanined water revenues during shutdowns of the Chingaza tunnel for
routine maintenance and inspection (once every five years following a more
frequent interval in the early years); (ii) power generation of 15 GWh per
year in existing hydro power plants; (iii) water supply of 2.0 m3/sec
beginning in 2006 when existing supply sources reach capacity; (iv) a three
year delay in the construction of Bogota's next major supply needed in 2006
without the reservoir; and (v) recreation. These benefits have an IRR of
10t.
15.       The other benefits of the San Rafael reservoir which have not
been quantified are: (i) reduction of the risk of a major tunnel failure
occurring by allowing preventive maintenance (A tunnel failure in January
1984 resulted in an estimated loss of US$30 million in power and water
revenues); and (ii) improved day-to-day operation of the Wiesner water
treatment plant through flow regulation.
Implementation Study and Design for the Bogota River Pollution and Flood
Control Plant (Part E)
16.        The discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastes into
the tributaries of the Bogota River has caused a serious pollution problem
downstream of the city.  This pollution poses a threat to the health of
persons living in communities which use the river for drinking water
and irrigation, and is even affecting the use of the Magdalena River for
water supply, fishing and recreation, which the Bogota River joins 120 km



-56-
ANNEX 4
Page 5
southwest of the city. Also, the Bogota River periodically overflows its
banks causing damage to existing urban development and preventing further
development of the river flood plain.
17.        Loan 741-CO financed a study completed in 1974 by Camp Dresser
and McKee of the Bogota River flood and pollution problems.   This study
recommended the construction of an interceptor paralleling the Bogota River
and terminating at a water pollution control plant where the River leaves
the  Bogota  plain  as  a  means  of  abating  pollution.    Deepening  and
straightening of the Bogota River was recommended as a solution to the
flooding problem. Both recommendations were confirmed with some modifica-
tions by a study undertaken by Black and Veatch and financed with funds
from Loan 1697-CO. Black and Veatch also prepared final designs for flood
control works and preliminary designs for the water pollution control
plant.  As a result of these two studies, the technical solutions are mow
well defined. However, the economic justification and investment priority
of the project is not  clear.   Before the technical solutions can be
implemented, the institutional, land development, financial and cost
recovery aspects of implementing the technical solutions need to be
addressed.   As part of the new project, further studies in cooperation
with the Bogota District Planning Department and CAR would be undertaken
with the following objectives:
(a)  to identify and propose solutions to all remaining con-
straints to project implementation;
(b)  to determine project justification on economic, social and
ecological grounds;
(c) to establish the projects national and local priority once
justification is established;
(d) to ensure the appropriate and orderly development and use of
the reclaimed land;
(e) to prepare an implementation and financing plan, including
institutional responsibilities;
(f) to identify sources of financing and develop a cost recovery
plan;
(g) to complete final designs for the first stage water pollu-
tion control plant and connecting interceptor; and
(h)  to identify the need for and propose legislation to allow
for uhe equitable cost recovery and efficient operation of
the proposed works.

The Institutional Strengthening of EAAB (Part F)
18.         EAAB agreed at negotiations on a Plan of Action (Annex 5) to
improve its operations in the following areas:
(a) management information and control systems;
(b) reduction of unaccounted-for water control;
(c) commercial procedures;
(d) training; and
(e) control of personnel costs.
Technical assistance under this part of the project would support EAAB in
carrying out the action program in the first four areas.   The technical
assistance would be supplemented with scholarships for training of EAAB's
staff. Funds for the purchase of special equipment would also be provided.
19.        The technical assistance would be entrusted to three consulting
firms (or joint ventures), a management and accounting firm with sector ex-
perience for the management aspects, a training specialist and an
engineering firm for the unaccounted-for water control.  The consultants
would build on an improved existing systems, introduce modern technology,
help implement improvements and provide on the job training for EAAB's
staff. Outside training would complement on the job training.
20.       The consulting assignments would be carried out in three separate
phases with the decision to proceed from one phase to the other made only
after each phase is complete.  The three phases would be:  (1) evaluation;
(2) planning/design; and (3) implementation. The work to be performed un-
der each phase would be as follows:
(a) Evaluation Phase. Existing systems and procedures would be
assessed, deficiencies identified and improvements proposed.
The recommendations for changes would include an assessment
of the impact these changes may have on the organization as
a whole.
(b)  Planning/Design Phase.  In this phase the proposed changes
would be designed and procedures for their implementation
developed.
(c) Implementation Phase. The improvements and systems develop-
ed in the planning phase would be implemented in this phase
through the coordinated effort of EAAB's staff and the con-
sultants. Personnel training and the purchase of equipment
as required would take place in this phase.

ANNEX 4
Page 7
21.            Outline terms of reference for the management  technical
assistance are included in the project file. The objectives and scope of
this technical assistance would be as follows:
(a) Review EAAB's planning, project design and supervision, op-
erating, commercial, support and information handling activ-
ities, assess the number and quality of staff EAAB would re-
quire through 1995, and propose a plan to use the staff more
efficiently and a training program to increase its product-
ivity.
(b) Review EAAB's organizational structure, paying special at-
tention to the commercial unit and commercial related activ-
ities being carried out by other units and propose changes;
(c) review EAAB's commercial records and billings, collection
and customer service procedures, and recommend improvements;
(d) propose a management reporting system which should include
technical, project control, comnercial, cost control, and
financial information;
(e) propose improvements to EAAB's financial accounting system
and a simple cost system, which should be compatible with
EAAB's reporting system;
(f) propose improvements to EAAB's budgeting system, which
should include a methodology to prepare both the reports re-
quired by regulatory authorities and those required by man-
agement;
(g) propose a plan to integrate EAAB's information systems which
should include stages of implementation and a timetable;
(h) carry out an operational audit of EAAB's electronic data
processing function and propose recommendations for improve-
ments, and identify any equipment needs;
(i) assist EAAB in developing a financial planning model compat-
ible with its overall information/control system;
(j)  assist EAAB in implementing the proposed systems and imr
provements until they are working regularly, and train
EAAB's staff in maintaining them; and
(k) assist EAAB in preparing a permanent training plan and a
training program to be carried out during project execution.

22.          The unaccounted-for water program is included in the project
file.  The objectives and scope of the technical assistance to implement
the program would be as follows:
(a) quantify the problem, identifying the extent of illegally
consumed water, water lost through leakage and under-regis-
tered by meters, etc.;
(b) assess EAAB's organization and programs for the reduction of
the unaccounted-for water, the adequacy of present equip-
ment, methods and staff, and propose the required improve-
ments; and
(c) assist EAAB in implementing the improvements required.
23.         A proposed training plan for EAAB is included in the project
file.  The objectives and scope of technical assistance to implement the
plan would be as follows:
(a) define training needs;
(b) establish policy and training objectives;
Cc) develop a five-year plan for each training category;
(d) define the organization and duties of a training unit;
Ce) describe the physical and human resources required to carry
out an effective training program; and
(f) estimate training costs.
24.        A number of equipment items required for the efficient operation
and maintenance of EAAB's facilities are not available locally. Therefore,
funds would be provided under this part of the project to allow EAAB to
purchase equipment as the need should arise during project implementation.
The types of equipment that EAAB is expected to purchase includes leak de-
tection instruments, flow measurement instruments, data processing equip-
ment, personal computers, communication equipment, telemetering equipment,
training equipment, and heavy construction equipment.   Heavy construction
equipment purchased under this part of the project would be financed with
export credits and commercial bank loans to the maximum extent possible.

Project Engineering and Administration (All Parts)
25.            About 200 persons  currently assigned to the Engineering
Department  would  be  utilized  to  supervise  the  secondary  network
construction, the rehabilitation work and some of the medium-diameter water
main  installations.      Consultants  would  be  hired  to  supervise  the
construction  of  the  tunnel,  the  larger  primary  distribution  main
installation, the pumping station and distribution reservoir construction
and  the  San  Rafael  reservoir.         Fupervision  responsibilities  for
construction of a project would also include coordination of the
procurement of the materials and equipment. Technlcal personnel from EAAB,

consultant-supervised projects under the direction of the consultants.
26.        A panel of experts will be required to review the dam design and
monitor its construction. EAAB would retain internationally recognized ex-
perts for this panel.

FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Project Cost Estimates
1.        A detailed cost estimate of the project in US dollars is included
as Attachment 1. Consulting man-month projections and cost estimates in US
dollars are included in the project file. All base cost estimates reflect
projected price levels for January 1985. Local costs have been converted
to US dollars at an exchange rate of Col$113.6 to-l.
2.         Base cost estimates for the construction components of the pro-
ject were prepared by consultants using quantity estimates from preliminary
design drawings. Pipe equipment and material cost estimates are based on
supplier quotations. Unit prices for civil works are based on recent bids
for civil works performed in Colombia.  Cost estimates for the water dis-
tribution components were prepared in mid-1984 and were updated to January
1985 prices based on an evaluation of construction cost trends in Colombia
in the recent past. Cost estimates for the San Rafael Reservoir were pre-
pared by EAAB in late 1984. The foreign cost of the construction compo-
nents includes the cost of imported materials and an estimate of the depre-
ciation cost of heavy equipment mist likely to be used in the project.
3.         The cost of consultants for studies, construction supervision,
technical assistance and leak detection are based on man-month estimates
for various tasks and prevailing rates charged by foL-ign and local
consultants in Colombia. Foreign consultant fees are subject to an 80% tax
which has been included in estimating the cost of wo=k to be carried out by
foreign consultants. The cost of equipment and meters to be purchased by
EAAB is an allowance based on the availabilitv of loan funds. EAAB's needs
for the purchase of additional equipment and meters is about twice the
amount of funds available for this purpose. The amount budgeted will make
available foreign exchange for the purchase of the most essential items.

ANNEX 6

4.        The estimated cost of rehabilitation and repair and the construc-
tion for secondary water, sewerage and drainage networks is an allowance
based on an estimate of EAAB's capacity to undertake this type of work.
Budgeting the amount of expenditures for this type of work more than a year
in advance is not possible since each project depends on an application
from the communities involved and where repairs are needed cannot be antic-
ipated.
5.        Taxes on materials and equipment are reflected in the local cost
component of each item.  Local materials and equipment are subject to a
value added tax which amounts to about 4% of the purchase price. Imported
goods are subject to a sales tax on the CIF value of 10%.
6.         Physical contingencies vary from 0 for allowance type cost esti-
mates to 15% for the tunnel and consultants. Price contingencies of 37% of
adjusted foreign base cost and 20% of adjusted local base cost have been
allowed.  Price contingency indices and the inflation and exchange rates
used  in their calculation are  shown below.   The indices assume all
exnenditures occur at mid year.

FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Notes to EAAB's Financial Statements
General
EAAB's Financial  Statements  of  1982 are audited.   Those of  1983 are
unaudited. The financial statements of 1984 have been projected mainly on
the basis of the 1984 budget and its execution through May 31, 1984. In
addition to the assumptions specified in page 5, (water demand, inflation,
exchange rates, tariff level, etc.), the projected financial statements of
1985-1993 are based on the assumptions specified below.
Revenues
1.        Water and Sewerage Revenues.  Projected by increasing tariffs
monthly beyond inflation in 1985-1988 and in line with inflation there-
after.
2.        Connection Charges.  Mainly right of service fees payable before
a water and sewerage connection is made. They are projected in line with
the number of new water and sewerage connections per year, assuming that
average charges per connection remain constant in real terms.
3.        Non-operating Income (Net).  Includes income from disposition of
assets, interest accrued on excess cash and miscellaneous revenues less as-
sociated costs. They are projected to increase in line with operating rev-
enues.
Operating Costs
4.        Personnel.  Projected to increase in line with water and sewerage
connections plus a 2% annual increase in real wages (to distribute the ben-
efits of economic growth), adjusted for reduction in the staff/1,000 con-
nections ratio.
5.        Chemicals.  Projected according to the use of the least-cost mix
of available water sources, and assuming that the m3 cost for each source
remains constant in real terms.



-80-
ANNEX 12
Page 7
6.         Power.  Kilowatt-hours consumed in water production is according
to the least-cost mix of available water sources. Kilowatt-hours consumed
to pump sewage is according to projected pumping requirements. Electricity
tariffs are assumed to increase 2.3% monthly in 1985 and in line with
inflation thereafter.
7.        Operation and Maintenance and Administrative Costs.  Projected to
increase in line with inflation and the growth in water connections.
8.        Depreciation (expense based on revalued fixed assets) and Related
Accounts.   Annual charges based on a 2.5% depreciation rate (down from
2.8% in 1982 and 2.6% in 1983) applied to fixed assets which include those
donated by developers and customers although they are not included in the
rate base.   Gross fixed assets, accumulated depreciation, and work in
progress before its incorporation, are revalued in line with inflation.
The lower than historic projected depreciation rate reflects the
incorporation in 1984 of substantial assets with useful lives in the 40-75
year range.
Working Capital and Other Assets/Liabilities
9.        Accounts Receivable for Services.  Projected to be equal to two
months of billings plus one month equivalent of water consumed but not yet
billed.
10.        Inventory.  Projected to be equivalent to 9 months of chemicals
and operating expenses plus 15 days of investments.
11.        Other Current Assets.  Includes prepaid expenses and miscella-
neous. They are projected to increase in line with total operating costs.
12.       Accounts Payable.  Includes payments due suppliers and contrac-
tors projected to be equivalent to two months of operating costs (other
than personnel) plus one month of investments.
13.       Other Current Liabilities.  Mainly personnel benefits payable.
They are projected to increase in line with personnel costs.
14.        Due from EEEB.  Estimated long term receivable (not discounted)
which results from settlement of the costs of the Chingaza project with Em-
presa de Energia de Bogota (EEEB) which is compensated by deleting invest-
ment assumed by EEEB of EAAB's rate base. EAAB is expected to coJlect this
account by withholding payment from EEEB for the electricity it will use.

FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Economic and Social Analysis
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Marginal Cost Calculations
1.        Economic rates of return (ERRs) have been calculated for water
supply (86% of total project cost), sewerage and drainage (6Z of total
project cost), water supply, sewerage and drainage components consolidated
(92% of total project cost). The Chingaza diversion scheme (Loan 1697-CO)
produces the water to be distributed by the project and has been treated as
a sunk cost in the ERR calculations; however, for purposes of comparison, a
consolidated ERR of the project including the Chingaza diversion scheme has
been made. Also, a separate ERR has been calculated for the San Rafael
reservoir.   Marginal costs were calculated using the long-run Average
Incremental Cost (AIC) method with an 11% discount rate. All costs are
expressed in January 1985 prices and include engineering, administration
and physical contingencies, and are exclusive of taxes and custom duties.
ERRs were not computed for the technical assistance, studies and the
purchase of maintenance equipment because the resulting benefits cannot be
quantified reliably. In AIC calculations, nontariff revenues (from
"derechos de suministro y matricula' and repayments for secondary networks
financed and constructed by EAAB) were deducted from total costs, so that
the resulting AICs are compa--qle to tariffs in evaluating pricing and
resource allocation. Revenues ezr,cted to be generated from covenanted
tariffs expressed in January 1985 prices have been used as a proxy for
economic benefits in the analyses. ERR and AIC calculations are included
in Attachments 1 through 5. A summary of assumptions is included in
Attachment 6. Detailed data are available in the project file.

Economic Rate of Return Including Consumer Surplus
3.        The ERRs, even at covenanted tariffs, measure only a part of a
project's benefits. The ERR can get closer to the full economic return if
the consumer surplus is included. The consumer surplus can be estimated if
the price elasticity is known. Two points on the demand curve are known:
the average charges (yl) and consumption (xl), and the price paid by urban
poor (for reasons of lack of service or frequently interrupted service) to
water vendors (yo) for small amounts of water (xo). An exponential func-
tion of the form y.Ce-bX can be fitted between these points. The ratio (k)
between the social and economic benefits perceived by the users and the ERR
will be the area below this function divided by the benefits estimated by
the traditional ERR (xl, multiplied by yl)- The integration of y-Ce-bx
between xo and xl provides the Area A-(xo-xl) (yo-yI)/ln(yl/y.). The
project benefits, including consumer surplus, are then K times higher than
those measured by the ERR.
K-(yI-yo)/y1ln(y1/yO) - (1-yO/yl)/ln(yI/yo)
4.        When the urban poor purchase small amounts of water (20 lcd or
about 2-3 m3 per family per month), they do so at prices about 4 times the
average price for piped water. For a ratio of yo to Yl of 4, K-2.20, and
the conslmer surplus can be estimated as the ERR at a tariff equal to 2.2
times the average tariff. The ERR for water supply, if the estimated
consumer surplus were included with investment and operating costs
increased by 10% and volume sold reduced by 10%, is 27.7Z.
Unaccounted-for Water Program Analysis
5.        A separate analysis wa.s made to determine the economic and
financial consequences of EAAB being unable to achieve the projected



-88-
ANNEX 15
Page 4
reductions in unaccounted-for water.   Failure to achieve the forecasted
reductions would have the following effects:   (a) operating costs would
increase in the short term due to higher power and chemical costs; (b)
investment in production capacity would be required five years earlier; and
(c) long term revenues attributable to the proposed project would be
reduced.     Because  the  projections  of  water  production  and  sales
requirements assume that unaccounted-for water is all leakage, short term
revenues would be unaffected. The ERR of the water supply component with
unaccounted-for water remaining at 36% indefinitely would be 9.5% versus
12.4Z with the projected reductions.   The effect of no reductions in
unaccounted-for water on the financial plan for the proposed project would
be negligible since power and chemical costs represent only 20% of EAAB's
operating budget.
Beneficiaries and Urban Poverty Impact
6.        The project largely consists of investments in water distribution
networks rehabilitation and storage.   Water service coverage would be
expanded  in established neighborhoods  that had relatively low service
levels and water would be supplied to others where population has been
growing rapidly. These neighborhoods are principally in the southern half
of the city where there is a comparatively larger proportion of the poor.
In addition, the project would improve water service in many parts of the
city, thereby benefitting a wide cross-section of the population.
7.        The water supply component of the project has a relatLvely higher
beneficial impact on the urban poor than on other income groups.   The
levels of urban poverty, defined as families earning a monthly monetary
income of Col$24,000 or less in September 1984 prices, were es:imated using
existing household surveys anl the latest National Statistics Department
(DANE) data (see stratification maps in project files). About 98% of the
population above the urban poverty threshold was already connected to
public water supply systems in mid-1984 (regardless of service quality).
Most areas into which new water networks and connections will be extended
are heavily populated by families below the poverty threshold. Even in new
areas of settlement to which -rater supply would be extended, a substantial
proportion of the population will be poor families that have recently
migrated to the city.
8.         It is estimated that in 1984 the urban poor made up roughly 30%
of Bogota's population and this share has been assumed to remain constant
throigh 1992.  The number of urban poor with water connections will rise
from 1.1 million in 1985 to 1.6 million in 1992, with the share connected
rising from 79% to 93%.   The modes:  investments  to be undertaken  in
sewerage under the project will still bene'it substantially the poor.
Under the project, the number of poor with sewerage will rise from 0.9
million to 1.1 - illton, with the share connected rising from 63% to 66%

Page 5
during  1985-92.    The areas  to be affected by drainage works have a
higher-than-average share of their population below the poverty threshold.
Thus, substantial numbers of the poor will benefit from better sanitary
conditions and higher values for their land.
9.         An evaluation of the affordability of water supply and sewerage
services was made based on 1984 tariffs. In 1984, an extremely poor family
(estrato Bajo-Bajo) with a monthly income of half the poverty threshold
(Col$12,000) would pay 0.42 of its income for qinimum acceptable
consumption of water (10 m3) and sewerage services, while those at the
threshold income level would pay the same percentage. Even with projected
increases in tariffs, services are expected to remain affordable to the
poor.
10.             EAAB  applies  simplified procedures  to enable  low-income
inhabitants to connect to the systems.  As some low-income "barrios" have
been established as squatter areas, EAAB has been forced to waive or be lax
on a number of prerequisites, such as legal title, construction permits and
registration in the cadastral register, which applicants for water supply
services normally have to comply with.
11.        EAAB's policy is to recuperate the cost of its water production
and primary distribution facilities through separate charges in addition to
water consumption charges.  As stated earlier, two connection charges are
levied.   One, 'derecho de matricula", is equal to 2-5X of the cadastral
value, and the "derecho de suminstro" is charged at a unitary value of
ColS69/m2 of new construction.   Regarding the  matricula', houses with a
value of Col$934,000 in 1983 were exempted from the levy; 682 of the new
subscribers (including all of those classified as poor) in 1983 fell in
this category. EAAB expects this trend to continue. Detailed figures are
in the project file.  Regarding the "suministro", the average constructed
area of new subscribers was about 83 m2 in 1983 yielding Col$5,727.   In
1985 onwards, this is projected to average ColS6,488.  Assuming the very
poor fall in this average category, the connection fee would therefore be
about 4.52 of the yearly family income.  This should not prove to be an
undue burden as low income consumers are granted long repayment terms and
preferential interest rates (five years at 102 p.a.).  On these terms, the
repayments and financing charges would average only about 0.8Z of family
income during the five year repayment period.   Past experience has shown
consumers had little difficulty paying off the connection charges.
12.           In addition to the regular tariff and the connection or
"suministru" fee, low income consumers may also be repaying EAAB for a
water,  sewerage  and  drainage  network.    Most  secondary  networks  are
constructed and financed by developers with the cost being recovered in the
price of the l,?r.   Although it is against the law, much land in  -he
District has been subdivided and sold without utilities primarily to the
poor who cannot afford to purchase improved lots.  Also, tihere are a nurmber
of permanently established squatter areas which lack utilities.   In the



-90-
ANNEX 15
Page 6
early 1970s, the District began legalizing many illegal developments and
autborized EAAB to provide water, sewerage and drainage networks in these
areas at cost. EAAB responded witb a program which constructs networks at
a barrio's request, allocates the cost among the beneficiaries and provides
financing. Payments are collected througb the regular hi-monthly billing
process. Financing terms are 10 years at 12X interest. The average cost
per family for a water and sewerage network provided througb this system is
Col$25,000.  Repayment at EAAB's terms would average 2Z of family income
for a poor family during the first five years.
13.       A family provided service under the project would be faced with a
cost for water and sewerage service that varied over time.   The highest
charges would occur during the first five years wbile the connection fee
and network charges were being repaid. By the eleventh year, the family
would be paying only for water consumed and for the hasic sewerage
service. An estimate of a low income customer's montbly payments over
time are as follows:

FOURTH BOGOTA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Assumptions for Economic Analysis
Water Supply
1.        Incremental population served includes all additional people con-
nected to the system beginning in mid-1985 and extending through the year
2005.  Excludes population already connected whose service would be im-
proved.
2.          Incremental number of connections and consumption are obtained
from incremental population assuming an average of just over 6 persons per
account and a consumption of about 38 m3/connection/month.
3.         Incremental production is obtained by adjusting incremental con-
sumption for unaccounted-for water (Annex 3, Attachment 2).
4.         Revenues stem from tariffs, connection charges and recuperation
of investment costs in secondary networks built by EAAB. Tariff levels are
based on tariff forecasts (Annex 12) expressed in January 1985 prices.
Water connection fees and right of service charges are applied to all
incremental connections between 1985 and 2005 ("Derechos de matricula'=
Col$12061 and -summistro"=Col$6488 on average per eligible connection--see
para.  10 of "Economic and Social Analysis").   Recuperation of network
investments is assumed over a 10 year period at zero interest. The actual
interest charged is 12X which is assumed to compensate for inflation.
5.           Investment costs include all water related expenditures for
primary distribution, distribution rehabilitation, secondary networks,
storage, metering and connections.   They are based on costs developed in
the master plan for water supply. All investment costs include engineering
and physical contingencies and make allowance for replacement of equipment.

6.         Operating Costs include costs for operating personnel, adminis-
tration, chemicals, energy and materials. Operating personnel and materi-
als cost are based on the present cost per connection. Incremental adminis-
tration costs are assumed to be roughly 30% of operating personnel cost.
Chemical costs are projected at a level of Col$0.72/m3 of water produced.
Energy costs are based on a cost of Col$1.23/m3 of water produced. Incre-
mental 0 & M costs can also be calculated using unit costs of Col$9.9/m3 of
water produced. These are derived from operating costs for 1984 under as-
sumptions that:  15% of the total cost of 0 & M are fixed costs which will
not increase due to the project and 70% of the remainder is due to water
supply operation and 30% for sewerage and drainage (Col$6.9 for water and
Col$3.0 for sewerage).
7.         Shadow Prices.  Efficiency prices are applied only for the un-
skilled labor portion of investment and operating costs.  It is estimated
at 15% of total cost. Foreign exchange is not shadow-priced since the Gov-
ernment's policy is aimed at reaching a real exchange equilibrium level in
relation to the US dollar.   The efficiency wage rate is derived on the
assumption that without the project, an average of about 90% of the
available unskilled labor force in Bogota is engaged in productive activi-
ties. The market wage rate is assumed to represent the marginal productiv-
ity of labor and the efficiency wage rate (EWR) is estimated as:
EWR = R x P = 0.93 x 0.9 = 0.84
where R is the consumption conversion factor used to convert the opportuni-
ty cost of labor into border prices and P is the probability of hiring a
previously employed worker.
Sewerage
8.        Incremental population served includes 64% of all additional
people connected to the sewerage system and benefitting from drainage iw-
provements beginning in 1985 and extending through 1991, the final year of
sewerage investment under the project.
9.        Incremental connections  are obtained from incremental population
as per shown in para. 2.
10.       Incremental sewage flow is assumed to be 38 m3/connection/month.
11.       Revenues  stem from sewerage tariffs (50% of water tariff) and
were calculated along the lines of para. 4. Also included is the recipera-
tion of the investment cost over a 10 year period from the consumers who
must pay 15% down in order for a sewerage collection system and drainage
system to be installed in their community.  The normal interest rate is
12%.  Since this is about equal to inflation, repayment at zero interest
has been assumed.

12.       Investment costs include all sewerage and drainage related expen-
ditures  for  secondary  networks  (pipes,  fittings  and  installation,
engineering and administration) during the project period.
13.        Operating costs  include costs for operating personnel, adminis-
tration and materials based on costs per connection (see para. 6 above).
14.       Shadow prices - same procedure as para. 7.
