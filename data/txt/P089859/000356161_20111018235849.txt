2.      The development objective of the LJIIS Project is to “contribute to improving
judicial efficiency and effectiveness and the business climate in FYR Macedonia by: (i)
enhancing ministerial and judicial capacity to systemically implement the Government’s
Judicial Reform Strategy and key laws; and (ii) improving judicial infrastructure.?

3.     The Project is on track. The current ISR rates the progress towards achievement
of the Project Development Objective as satisfactory and the overall implementation
progress as moderately satisfactory. Significant progress has been made in rehabilitating
a number of courts – all eleven courthouse renovations have been completed and
equipped with new furniture. The only remaining construction activity, the new Criminal
Court building in Skopje, is ongoing and will be completed before the Project closing
date. LJIIS Project support for enhancing IT systems in the courts is also near
completion, with the Automated Court Case Management and Information System
(ACCMIS) installed and functioning in all courts in the country. Progress has been made
in raising the quality of bankruptcy trustees and implementation of the revised
Bankruptcy Law, with all trustees licensed and a complaints procedure in place.
Technical assistance to the State Administrative Inspectorate was completed ahead of
schedule. Capacity development activities with the Judicial Council have lagged in
implementation of its program for the evaluation, promotion and disciplining of judges,
but a program to be completed by the closing date of the Project has been agreed,
including study tours to Judicial Councils in neighboring countries.

4.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to finance:

(i) IT equipment for the new High Administrative Court in Skopje. The court is fully
equipped with office furniture and with the ACCMIS funded by the LJIIS Project, but
still requires suitable IT equipment (computers, printers, a server, a rack, an operating
system and licenses for the server and computers, virus protection and a workstation for
the server management) to become fully functional.

(ii) (a) hardware for the State Administrative Inspectorate and Ministry of Justice, (b) a
survey on judicial efficiency, including an indicator measuring the impact of the LJIIS
Project, and (c) other expenditures related to the 8-month closing date extension period
(operating costs and consulting services in the PIU, project audit).
