TECElNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Republic of Sierra Leone
Amount:                   US$2.5 million
Terms:                    Standard
Project Description:      The project aims at strengthening the Government's
capability in development planning, the preparation
of development projects, the training of local staff,
and the monitoring and evaluation of public invest-
ment programs. It includes: (a) 10 man-years of
advisers (five advisers for two years each); (b) 75
nmn-months of consultants; (c) training in develop-
ment planning and project preparation; and (d)
project preparation and pre-feasibility studies.
The benefits expected to be derived from the project
iniclude the formulation of sounder and more realistic
public investment policies and programs; the prepara-
tion and implementation of priority development
projects; and strengthening of the Government's
project evaluation and monitoring system. Some risk
cannot be avoided in a project of this kind where
successful implementation is contingent upon the
availability of suitable expatriate personnel and
where the benefits of the project depend upon the
ability of Government to follow through with imple-
mentation of the results of the planning effort.
However, given the relatively short-term contract
(maximum of two years) involved, it should prove
possible to secure'suitable personnel; also, the
Government has expressed its firm commitment to this
project.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Sierra Leone for the equivalent of
US$2.5 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a technical assistance
project for planning and project preparation.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         A basic economic report, "Sierra Leone - Current Economic Position
and Prospects" (No. 494a-SL dated November 27, 1974), was distributed to
the Executive Directors. Subsequently, two updating Economic Memoranda (No.
1106-SL dated June 25, 1976) and (No. 2153-SL dated June 26, 1979) have also
been distributed to the Executive Directors. Country data sheets are con-
tained in Annex I.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The economy of 'Sierra Leone is dualistic in character, a relatively
small modern sector co-exi'sting alongside a large traditional agricultural
sector. For its source of income and growth, Sierra Leone relies heavily
on agriculture and mining, although in recent years depletion of the country's
richest mineral deposits has led to a decline in their relative contribution
to the economy. Diamonds, the largest export earner, accounted for nearly 63
percent of exports in 1978.  The country's over dependency on a single com-
modity for foreign exchange renders the economy highly vulnerable to external
market disturbances.
4.        The agricultura:L sector, still largely outside the monetized econ-
omy, provides livelihood for nearly 75 percent of the population. Its con-
tribution to GDP, however, is around 35 percent implying a low level of
agricultural productivity and food output per capita on the average. Rice is
the staple food and is grown by over 80 percent of the farmers, primarily for
subsistence, although the country still faces rice shortages, especially in
the rural areas.  Coffee, cocoa and palm products are the major export crops
and also the principal souarces of cash income for the rural population.
5.         Sierra Leone has a poorly developed social and economic infrastruc-
ture. Although the extent of the road transport network is generally
adequate for its present needs there is urgent need for improved maintenance
and the development of feeder roads. The country has rich water resources,
although the hydro power potential is still untapped. Only about 12 percent
of the population has access to a safe drinking water supply, mostly



- 2 -
LL teie urban areas.  Health facilities are inadequate and infant and childhood
mortality rates are among the highest in Africa. Although the Government has
in recent years invested quite heavily in education, primary and secondary
school enrollment ratios are low (37 percent and 11 percent, respectively)
and the country's illiteracy rate remains high, around 85 percent.
b.         The dualistic economic structure is reflected in income disparities
between the modern and traditional sectors. With a population of about 3.2
million, average per capita GNP in 1978 was estimated at about US$210.
The average per capita rural income is around US$90 while it averages about
US$500 in the urban centers. About 21 percent of the population live in urban
areas. The urban migration rate (4.9 percent) is relatively low compared with
neighboring countries; however, approximately 25 percent of the urban popula-
tion have an income level below the urban relative poverty threshold estimated
at around US$80.
Depletion of Mineral Resources
7.        Until 1972 the main stimulus to economic growth in Sierra Leone
was the production and export of diamonds. Output of diamonds began to
decline significantly after 1972 as a result of the depletion of alluvial
deposits. Illicit diamond mining and smuggling (both difficult to control)
have been important factors shortening the life of the deposits and limiting
the contribution of diamonds to official export earnings. Furthermore, the
early 1970's was marked by sharp increases in oil prices and the continued
upsurge in the prices of imported manufactured products. In 1975 the country
lost its second largest source of export earnings when the only iron ore mine
closed due to rising production costs and a declining iron ore grade. These
several developments further aggravated the domestic resource squeeze and put
added pressure on the balance of payments and the country's foreign exchange
resources. In 1978, Sierra Leone's diamond production was less than one-third
of its 1970 level and mineral production as a whole had declined by about 70
percent over the same period. Largely as a consequence, the growth of GDP
became erratic and during the period between 1972 and 1979 hardly exceeded one
percent per annum on the average. With population growing at about 2.5
percent per annum, this resulted in a sharp fall in already low per capita
real incomes.
The Financial Disequilibrium
8.        During its first decade of independence between 1962 and 1972, the
domestic and external finances of Sierra Leone did not come under undue
pressure primarily as a result of buoyancy in real domestic resources.
Throughout this period, a nearly 5 percent growth in GDP per annum provided
substantial foreign exchange earnings and also contributed to a satisfactory
growth in public revenues. From 1973, however, the slowdown in economic
growth and the erosion of the export-base were accompanied by a marked deteri-
oration in fiscal performance characterized by stagnating public revenues and
expanding public expenditure policies. While public revenues increased by
only 0.8 percent per year between 1973 and 1975, public expenditures grew
about 13.5 percent and the overall budget deficit widened from Le 22 million



-3 -
to Le 52 million. With no compensating changes in the structure of the
economy, fiscal and monetary expansion, financed largely by domestic and
short-term external borrowing, led to ever widening budget deficits, a further
deterioration in the balance of payments and a substantial increase in the
country's external debt burden. Despite substantial deficit financing,
however, the overall inflation rate in the economy has remained relatively
moderate (around 11 percent per annum since 1976) as the demand created by
monetary expansion was met by increased imports.
Public Finances
9.        During 1974/75, there was a sharp decline in economic performance.
Revenue growth was severely affected by weakening of export prices. Tax
and dividend receipts from the National Diamond Company fell by 50 percent.
Also, revenues from corporate income taxes reflected the sluggishness of
private sector activity. Meanwhile, total public expenditures rose by
more than 30 percent. The weak fiscal performance continued in 1975/76.
In 1977, however, despite continued stagnation in GDP, public revenues improved
as a result of significant terms of trade gains. Expressed as a proportion of
GDP, public revenues rose to a peak of 22 percent in 1977/78 from about 16
percent in 1975/76. Yet, during this relatively favorable period, the budge-
tary situation deteriorated as external debt service obligations began to
claim more than one-third of government revenues while current and capital
spendings grew rapidly. During the last two years, the increase in expendi-
tures was largely attributable to civil service salary adjustments, expansion
of the internal security forces and to extra budgetary spending related to the
OAU Conference to be held in Freetown in mid-1980. As a result of these
developments, the overalL deficit of the central government increased from Le
52 million in 1975/76 to almost Le 106 million in 1977/78 and to Le 119
million in 1978/79.
Balance of Payments
10.       The impact of stagnant production on the balance of payments was
masked in the early 1970's by favorable export prices for Sierra Leone's major
exports. Consequently, the country's foreign exchange reserves remained at
satisfactory levels until the end of 1973. Difficulties began to emerge in
1974 when import prices rose sharply as a result of the oil crisis and inter-
national inflation, while export performance remained modest. Until 1974, the
current account deficits were more than offset by net capital inflows and the
overall balance of payments surplus averaged around US$7 million. In 1974 and
onwards, the balance of payments began to deteriorate and showed increasing
overall deficits. As petroleum consumption is relatively high in Sierra Leone
(mining, transport, power), the balance of payments position has been particu-
larly affected by oil price increases. The cost of petroleum imports jumped
from US$8 million in 1971 to about US$40 million in 1978. In late 1978, there
was an unprecedented increase of over 100 percent in world diamond prices;
however, because of the depletion of alluvial deposits mining output neverthe-
less declined over 10 percent in real terms. Moreover, the world price boom



- 4 -
in 1977 for agricultural export crops dampened in 1978. As a result, export
earnings grew moderately. Import demand, on the other hand, rose sharply with
expansionary policies and accelerated capital expenditures of the public
sector. The balance of payments deficit rose to $48 million in 1978 from
about $7 million in 1977. Sierra Leone's net foreign exchange reserves stood
at around $34 million at the end of 1974. They declined steadily until 1977;
after a short-lived recovery in 1977, due to import controls and more favor-
able world prices, there was further deterioration and net foreign reserves
became negative ($15 million) by the end of 1978. Gross reserves (equivalent
to 6 weeks imports) stood at $34 million.
Economic Stabilization
11.       A Standby Arrangement in the first credit tranche was concluded
between Government and the IMF in mid-1977 based on an economic stabilization
program providing for increased government revenues, restraint in public
expenditures and improved external debt management. More recently, in
August 1979, the IMF reached another agreement with the Government on a
further stabilization program which forms the basis for a Standby Arrangement
in the second and third credit tranches for about SDR 17.0 million and a Trust
Fund Loan of about SDR 9.0 million. The program includes revenue raising
measures (which have already been implemented), a limit on expenditures
(including expenditures on the OAU Conference), severe restrictions on new
external debt, tighter monetary policy and adjustments in producer prices.
Government is making more strenuous efforts than hitherto to strengthen its
control over expenditures. Former "self-accounting" ministries have been
brought under the control of the Ministry of Finance; quarterly ceilings have
been placed on Ministries' expenditures, supplementary appropriations have
been prohibited and hiring of new personnel has been frozen for one year.
Nevertheless, the current fiscal year is bound to be a difficult one for
Sierra Leone as a result of the fiscal pressures associated with expenditures
due to the forthcoming OAU Conference.
Development Plan and Objectives
12.       The country's first National Development Plan (1974/75-1978/79)
was prepared with the assistance of UNDP and the UN Department of Technical
Cooperation for Development. The development strategy and objectives stated
in the plan and many of its basic elements were well conceived and articu-
lated. Priority was to be given to the expansion of the productive capacity
of the economy and to a more equitable distribution of wealth and incomes.
Unfortunately the period of the plan coincided with the rapid erosion of the
country's principal source of foreign exchange earnings and a deterioration in
the government's fiscal performance. This combination of factors undermined
the economic and financial resource assumptions underlying the Plan. Govern-
ment's policies concentrated increasingly on short-term financial problems and
neglected the requirements of longer-term structural adjustment. More
recently government has begun to focus again on medium-term policies and has
formulated a three year public investment program (1976/79-1980/81) as an



- 5 -
interim measure and has initiated the preparation of a second National Devel-
opment Plan. The public investment program attempts to shift resources to
increased commodity production, particularly in agriculture, while recognizing
fiscal constraints. The second plan is expected to address the questions
of structural adjustment and give emphasis to the productive sectors together
with income distribution objectives.
13.       Over the past four years between 1974/75 and 1977/78 capital
spending by the public sector amounted to about Le 206 million (nearly
30 percent of total public expenditures). Out of this total about 55 percent
was spent on economic services, (including nearly 25 percent on agriculture),
15 percent on social services and infrastructure and about 30 percent on
general services, including internal security. Of these expenditures 17
percent was financed by budgetary savings while the remaining 83 percent came
from external and internal borrowings.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
14.       At the end of 1978, Sierra Leone's external public debt outstanding,
including arrears of principal, amounted to $330 million of which $299.6
million was disbursed. Arrears, including interest, were estimated at
$11.2 million, the bulk of which were due for suppliers' credits. The
total debt outstanding and disbursed consisted roughly of 38 percent in
suppliers' credits, 31 percent bilateral government-to-government loans
and 22 percent loans and credits from international organizations and about 9
percent from financial institutions. Concessionary capital assistance from
bilateral government sources came mostly from the Federal Republic of Germany,
the United Kingdom and the Peoples Republic of China. As of December 31,
1978, the Bank Group holds about 12 percent of Sierra Leone's external debt
outstanding and disbursed.
15.       Since 1976 Sierra Leone's public external debt outstanding and
disbursed has increased by about $130 million, mainly in the form of short-
term suppliers' credits. As a result, the country's external debt profile has
deteriorated. Although not in itself large (about 30 percent of GDP), the
maturity structure of the debt places an unbearable burden on the balance of
payments and the budget over the next few years. Based on external debt
commitments made until the end of 1978, it is estimated that scheduled exter-
nal debt service payments for 1979 stand at around $53 million. If the
accumulated debt service arrears are carried over to 1979, Government's
external debt service obligation would total about $64.5 million, equivalent
to 31 percent of expected export earnings and over 40 percent of expected
government revenues. Debt service on Bank Group loans and credits represents
about 2.5 percent of Sierra Leone's total debt service liability in 1979.
16.       Sierra Leone has almost entirely paid off its debt servicing
obligations to the members of Paris Club under the one year (July 1977-
June 1978) rescheduling agreement negotiated in November 1977. However, since
then the country's ability to service its external debt has again become
seriously impaired. The recent Standby Arrangement with DIF (para. 11), will
enable the Government to seek further debt relief through the Paris Club.



-6-
17 ~    In the short-term, further external debt rescheduling will be
crucial for improving the country's ability to service its external debt.
In the medium and longer-term, it is foreseeable that Sierra Leone can
both restore and sustain its creditworthiness provided Government formulates
po icies and investment programs aimed at the structural transformation
of the economy.  The future outlook of the mining sector in Sierra Leone
is difficult to assess in view of the limited knowledge of the extent of
mineral deposits. There are prospects for kimberlite underground diamond
mining; large iron ore reserves have been discovered, but these are of
low ore grade; mining of rutile has just recommenced and there are plans
to expand bauxite production in concert with Alusuisse. The proposed Bumbuna
hydro power project could provide lower cost energy to support these activi-
ties. A further intensification of the present efforts in the agricultural
sector will result in a diversification of the country's economic base,
increased export earnings from cocoa, coffee and palm oil, and raise the
standard of living and incomes for the vast majority of the country's people.
The implementation of programs designed to achieve structural transformation
will take time to implement and will require substantial flows of external
assistance on concessionary terms. Although the present balance of payments
situation and the country's debt profile would not justify lending on normal
IBRD terms, the country's low per capita income and its recent efforts to
improve economic performance would justify extending IDA assistance.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SIERRA LEONE
Bank Group Operations
18.       Bank Group lending operations in Sierra Leone to date have totalled
US$50.0 million. There have been four loans amounting to US$18.7 million
and six credits totalling US$31.3 million. Three loans and four credits are
fully disbursed. Bank Group lending has supported agriculture (28.7 percent),
education (20.5 percent), power (31.8 percent) and roads (19 percent). Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of August 31,
1979 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. In general, the execu-
tion of the ongoing agricultural and education projects has been satis-
factory and in spite of fiscal constraints, Government has for the most part
provided counterpart funds promptly; the implementation of the institutional
aspects of the third power project has encountered some problems mostly due to
weak management.
Lending Strategy
19.       The principal objectives of Bank Group assistance to Sierra Leone
are to help the Government to:



-7-
(a) diversify the economy and reduce dependence on mining by increasing
agricultural and manufacturing production;
(b) improve the country's essential infrastructure, particularly power
and roads, the inadequacy of which presently constitutes a con-
straint upon the country's economic growth;
(c)  broaden access to education and help relate the educational system
more closely to the manpower needs of the economy;
(d) raise the income levels of the poorest section of the population,
especially in rural areas; and
(e)  improve its planling and project preparation capability.
At the same time, the Bank Group aims through its projects to encourage
the adoption of appropriate sector pricing and tariff policies and to
strengthen the management and operations of the relevant government depart-
ments and corporations.
20.       With the halt in the production of iron ore since 1975 and the
decline in the production of diamonds, it has become increasingly important to
develop the agricultural and manufacturing potential of the economy. The
first and second Bank Group-financed agricultural development projects will
provide improved extension services, feeder roads and farm inputs to small-
holders affected by the project. The projects will help achieve and maintain
self-sufficiency in the production of staple food crops, such as rice, and
increase export earnings from cocoa and oil palm. A third agricultural
project is under preparation as an extension to the Eastern Province first
agricultural project which has been successfully completed and a fourth
agricultural project is a]Lso being prepared for expansion of smallholder
activities in the Northern Province.  Both these projects are designed to
improve the standard of living and incomes of low-income smallholders and at
the same time diversify the country's export base. These ongoing and prospec-
tive operations will complement other smallholder agricultural projects under
way in other provinces in Sierra Leone with the assistance of the Interna-
tional Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the European Economic
Community (EEC). The Bank Group is also discussing with Government a project
to rationalize and strengthen the operations of the Ministry of Agriculture
including credit facilities and improve research activities. A possible
DFC project may be prepared to assist the National Development Bank (NDB) in
financing small and medium scale enterprise development in agro-industries,
manufacturing and services.
21.       In infrastructure, the Bank Group's First Highway Project assisted
in the construction of the country's main trunk roacd system, in implementing
a maintenance program, and in preparing studies for further improvement of
the road system. A Secornd Highway Project for mainl:aining primary, secon-
dary and feeder roads will be presented to the Executive Directors shortly.
A third project in the power sector, approved in 1977, is helping finance
urgently needed extension of electric power generation and distribution
facilities in Freetown and several provincial centers, thereby restoring
a measure of reliability in the supply of power required for sustaining



- 8 -
the Sierra Leonean economy. The project is also helping strengthen the
finances and management of the Sierra Leone Electricity Corporation (SLEC).
At the same time, the project includes assistance for the preparation of
the Bumbuna hydroelectric scheme which is intended to reduce the country's
dependence on petroleum-based power.
22.       in the social sectors, two education projects approved by the
Bank Group have been directed towards improving and diversifying education at
the secondary level, including teacher training, modernizing curricula, as
well as creating a closer linkage between education and employment, encourag-
ing rural and non-formal training and strengthening educational planning
and management. Preparation will shortly begin on a third education
project which inter alia is expected to support the Government efforts to
increase access to primary education in the rural areas.
23.       To achieve its medium and longer-term developmental objectives,
the Government needs to improve its economic planning and project preparation
capability. The Bank Group has already provided technical advice to Government
in the formulation of its current three-year public investment program
(1978/9-1980/1) (para. 12 above). In responses to a request from Government,
the Bank Group has formulated the proposed technical assistance project which,
in cooperation with UNDP/TCD, is designed to assist Government in the formula-
tion of a second National Economic Development Plan and the preparation
of well-conceived development projects in a number of priority sectors.
24.       The proposed technical assistance project is the first new Bank
Group lending operation in Sierra Leone after a hiatus of over two years.
Continued improvement in the Government's management of the economy,
especially its external debt, will be important in determining the level of
future Bank Group lending to the country.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
25.       The First National Development Plan for Sierra Leone (1974/75-
1978/79) was prepared with the assistance of a team of expatriates under a
UNDP-financed, Department of Technical Cooperation for Development (TCD)
executed project. However, adverse economic trends and a deterioration in the
Government's management of the economy, discussed in Part I of this Report,
undermined the basis of the first plan.
26.       A second National Development Plan is scheduled for preparation
to cover the period 1981/82-1986/87, and the interim period, 1978/79-1980/81
is covered by the existing Public Investment Program. The Public Investment
Program emphasizes the need for developing a strong sector planning and
project preparation capability, particularly in the agricultural sector and
for infrastructure investments. It is this recognition by the Government of
the need to develop its planning capabilities, with particular regard to the
preparation and implementation of the Second National Development Plan, that
forms the basis of its request for technical assistance at both the sectoral
and central levels.

Technical Assistance to the Sectoral Ministries
27.       Sierra Leone has exhibited a very weak capability in development
planning and project preparation and implementation and it is believed that,
in addition to the UNDP/TCD team working with the Ministry of Development and
Economic Planning (MDEP) (described below), further technical assistance to
key sectoral ministries to help them develop their planning capabilities is
essential to achieve the desired structural transformation in the economy.
Sierra Leone needs to start work now on developing medium-term policies and
investment programs designed to provide the basis for an expanded development
effort when the current financial and debt problems are eased. The proposed
technical assistance project, which has been prepared in response to govern-
ment request, is intended to assist the Government by providing advisory
services to develop such planning capabilities with emphasis on the sectoral
ministries. Such assistance is to be provided in coordination with technical
assistance made available to Sierra Leone by other external agencies,
especially the UNDP. The ministries selected for assistance are those which
account for significant central government expenditures and which will be
important over the coming years in implementing Government's efforts to
stimulate production and at the same time improve social services.
Technical Assistance to the Ministry of Development and Economic Planning
28.       The Government is being assisted at the central level with the
formulation of the Second National Development Plan by a team of experts
financed by the UNDP and fielded by TCD. Working with the Ministry of Devel-
opment and Economic Planning's Central Planning Unit, the UNDP-financed
project will provide a project manager, development economist, financial
planner, rural development planner, and project appraisal adviser. This UNDP
project is scheduled to begin in January 1980 for a duration of three years.
Other Technical Assistance
29.       The Government and UNDP have requested the Bank to act as executing
agency for a one-man project providing an infrastructure adviser to the MDEP.
Additional UNDP assistance is being afforded to MDEP in the form of a TCD-
executed project providing a data processing analyst and an adviser on
management of computer systems to the Central StatistLcal Office. Other
expatriate planning advisory services being provided (Government include
a planning adviser to the Evaluation Section of the PLanning, Evaluation,
Monitoring and Services Uni't (PEMSU) of the Ministry of Agriculture financed
by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of UKC. Also, Government and
UNDP have requested the Baik to be executing agency for a one-man economic
adviser project in the Mini'stry of Finance.  The economic adviser who would
take up an assignment for two years in early 1980 would assist the Ministry of
Finance in strengthening its economic and fiscal analysis capabilities.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The project was prepared with the assistance of the Bank Group
and was appraised in August 1979. Negotiations were held in Freetown on
November 19-21, 1979. The representatives of the Government of Sierra Leone
were led by Mr. S. G. Banqura, Acting Development Secretary.
Project Objectives
31.       The objectives of the proposed project would be:
(a) to strengthen the Government's capability in development planning
with emphasis on the formulation of public sector investment pro-
grams, the establishment of development priorities and policy
instruments, and identification of resource availability and con-
straints;
(b) to assist Government in the preparation of priority development
projects aimed at diversifying and expanding the productive base of
the economy, improving the country's economic and social infra-
structure and promoting a broader distribution of the national
income;
(c) to train local staff in development planning and project preparation
and implementation;
(d) to establish a system for the monitoring and evaluation of public
investment programs.
These objectives should be seen within the framework of a long-term policy
aimed at gradual improvement in development planning and project preparation
in the central and sectoral ministries.
Project Description
32.       The proposed project will comprise four major elements:  (a)
advisers; (b) consultants; (c) training (principally in-country seminars); and
(d) financing for project preparation. It is proposed that there be five
planning advisers (whose responsibilities are described in more detail below),
each under two-year contract; 75 man-months consultancy services; funds for
two project planning and preparation courses and an allocation for project
preparation/pre-feasibility studies. The summary terms of reference for the
advisers, which were agreed during negotiations are set out in Annex IV. The
proposed project would begin early in 1980 and would last two years.



- 11 -
Advisers
33.       Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF):  The Project Evaluation
and Services Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture was established in the
then Ministry of Agriculture iand Natural Resources in 1976 with financing
assistance from the Bank Group's second agricultural project. PESU was
designed to oversee and assist Ministry of Agriculture Project Management
Units to:
-    ensure effective financial control and flow of funds to projects;
-    assist in maintaining adequate accounts;
-    formulate credit and farm input supply systems;
-    evaluate ongoing projects; and
-    provide these services to the two Bank Group-iinanced
projects and other future agricultural projects.
In January of this year, the functions of the planning unit of the Ministry
of Agriculture were merged wiith those of PESU and the unit now comprises the
combined services under the f-ull title Planning, Evaluaition, Monitoring and
Services Unit (PEMSU).
34.       The proposed techn:Lcal assistance project would include financing
for the advisory services of a senior economic planner and a project planner
to work within PEMSU. The senior economic planner would be responsible
for advising and assisting tlne administrative head of PEMSU on the development
of agricultural sector policies and programs, for assistance with the prepara-
tion of an agriculture sector investment program, for advising on the alloca-
tion of duties and delegation of responsibilities to the staff of the planning
section in PEMSU, and for liaison with other PEMSU section heads, with divi-
sional heads within MAF and with the Central Planning Unit of the MDEP. He
will also be expected to coordinate with other staff members of PEMSU in the
formulation of policy alternatives and advise on the ranking of projects.
The project planner's duties will include assistance irL the identification,
preparation, and appraisal of agricultural investment projects. He will
be charged with examining the various aspects of credit, marketing, farm
management, mechanization, land development, extension services, storage,
processing, etc., with a view to coordinating projects and avoiding duplica-
tion of efforts.
35.       Ministry of Works:  At present there is no planning unit within
the Ministry of Works, and the forward planning activities are carried out
by the respective section heads. There is some measures of coordination by
the Deputy Professional Head. However the heavy work load of the various
section heads due to the shortage of professionals in the Ministry of
Works, coupled with ineffeclive information and communication links, leads



- 12 -
to inadequate attention being given to proper planning. This is particularly
true in the Highways Sector. Therefore under the proposed project an
adviser would be assigned to the Highways Sector to develop a Highway
Maintenance and Construction Planning Unit. The highway engineer would be
charged with advising and assisting in the review and analysis of existing
and proposed plans concerning the Highways Sector, as well as assisting in
the preparation of future highways sector projects. He will be expected
to advise on the establishment of priorities both between and within
the activities of routine road maintenance, periodic maintenance, road
rehabilitation, reconstruction of roads and the construction of new roads.
Furthermore he will help the Professional Head and his Deputy in selecting
highway equipment, organizing road maintenance works, advising on the
reorganization of the Ministry, the soil laboratory and the maintenance and
construction areas, and improving administrative and financial procedures.
36.       Ministry of Health:  At present there is no planning unit within
the Ministry of Health and all planning responsibilities are carried out by
a staff member from MDEP on secondment to the Ministry. The Health Planning
Adviser will be charged, therefore, primarily with advising and assisting
the Permanent Secretary for Health with developing the planning unit to
assist the Ministry in the formulation and evaluation of health programs to
be implemented during the Second National Development Plan period (1981/82-
85/86). He will be expected to advise the Ministry in a variety of
activities including the design of appropriate data systems, improvements
in health services delivery, family planning services and health education
and the establishment of effective logistics and supply systems for drugs
and equipment.
37.       Ministry of Education:  Under the ongoing Education Project (IDA 573
SL) provision has been made for building and equipping a Planning Unit in the
Ministry of Education, but there are insufficient trained Sierra Leonean staff
to run the unit effectively. An Education Planning Adviser is required,
therefore, to assist in the preparation of long-range integral plans for
educational development within the policy guidelines and financial limits
prescribed by the Minister. The adviser will also be expected to advise on
and assist the Permanent Secretary for Education in a variety of activities
including, principally, the preparation of annual and short-term educational
development programs and proposals for the educational and training system,
establishing methodologies for the evaluation of both the implementation and
effectiveness of development plans and programs, and the analysis of educa-
tional problems requiring priority action and recommendation of approaches to
solve those problems.
Training Responsibilities of Advisers
38.       Past experience has indicated that the system of training through
the use of counterparts on a one-to-one basis has not always been completely



- 13 -
effective. Under the proposed. credit therefore the terms of reference
of the advisers will not only include the responsibility of working with
and training the assigned counterparts but also of training through task
forces.  Those ministries receiving advisory assistance under the proposed
credit would identify local staff who would participate iin major tasks with
each adviser as members of specific task forces. Training can thus be provided
for a greater number of local. staff along functional as well as managerial
lines and provide a greater degree of flexibility for the advisers to assist
with the national staff's professional development.
Consultancy Services
39.       The proposed project: includes about 75 man-months of consultancy
services. A significant proportion of this time will be allocated to the
Ministry of Agriculture. One major task will be to advise MAF on the estab-
lishment of a rural banking and agricultural credit system, taking into
consideration the role of the Farmer Finance Companies established under the
first and second Bank Group-supported agricultural projects. Other consul-
tants' time will be provided to various sections of MAF, including administra-
tion, forestry extension, etc.
40.       The Ministry of Works has identified a need for at least six
months of consultants' services by a mechanical engineer to advise and
assist on the new central equipment maintenance workshop, requirements for
spares, re-establishing preventive maintenance schedules, establishing
fleet controls, and writing specifications for new equipment and tools.
The Ministry of Health has also requested six to nine months' consultancy
services to reinforce the work of their planning unit, particularly with
respect to the identification and preparation of health projects. The
Ministry of Education has identified a need for a consultant to assist
in the design and construction of school buildings and a school map-
ping expert to prepare and maintain a school map showing the existing
and planned distribution of schools and school places at all levels in
relation to population and demand. The Ministry of Mines requires consul-
tants' services to assist Government in formulating plans for the development
of the mineral sector, in particular bauxite, and to advise on the conduct of
a number of contemplated mineral surveys. At least six to twelve months'
consultants' time will be needed by the Ministry of Development and Economic
planning to establish a central monitoring and evaluation system, and to
provide consultancy services to its Central Statistical Office.
41.       The balance of the consultancy funds will be allocated on an ad hoc
basis.
Training
42.       The proposed project will include funds for consultants and equip-
ment necessary to prepare at. least two in-country seminars dealing with sector
and central planning, project preparation, implementat-ion, monitoring and



- 14 -
evaluation. Such seminars would be designed in consultation and coordination
with the UNDP/TCD central planning project staff. The Government will make
available for such seminars the facilities of the new Institute of Public
Administration and Management, established under the Bank Group Education
Project.
Project Preparation
43.       Sierra Leone needs to build up its pipeline of development projects.
About US$650,000 of the Credit has therefore been allocated for the initiation
of project identification and preparation.
Implementation of the Proposed Project
44.       The project is expected to be implemented over a two-year period
(FY80-82). Each ministry concerned will be responsible for the implementation
of its component of the proposed project, and will provide counterpart staff
to the international advisers (Credit Agreement, Section 3.02). Coordination
between sectoral and central activities will be the responsibility of the
Ministry of Development and Economic Planning.  Contracts for advisers and
consultants will be subject to the approval of the Association (Credit Agree-
ment, Section 3.02). The Association will assist the Government in the
recruitment process.
Coordination of Overall Planning Activities
45.       To ensure the effective overall coordination of planning activities
between the central and sectoral ministries, appropriate institutional
arrangements are required. In this connection, the Government established in
1972 two principal planning bodies: (i) The National Planning Council headed
by the President, and including the Vice Presidents, Cabinet Ministers, and
the Governor of the Bank of Sierra Leone; and (ii) The Interministerial
Committee of Permanent Secretaries headed by the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Development. These two committees have not met regularly in
recent years. Provision was also made for the establishment as necessary
of interministerial technical working level committees.   The two policy
level committees will be reactivated and it has been agreed with Government
that, as a condition of credit effectiveness, a technical level working
committee will be established which will meet at least quarterly to discuss
activities and progress and monitor coordination of the Government's planning
exercises. The technical committee will comprise the representatives of the
planning units and appropriate professional staff of sectoral and central
ministries (Credit Agreement, Section 3.07).
Project Cost and Financing
46.       The total cost of the proposed project has been estimated at
US$2.8 million net of taxes and duties, of which US$2.5 million, or 89 percent



- 15 -
is to be covered by the proposed credit. The balance would be paid by the
Government from the proceeds of the sale of US food aid (PL 480). Project
costs are as follows:
US$ Million
Local    Foreign    Total
Advisory Services                                   0.245       0.8 40       1.085
Consultancy Services                                0.022       0.750        0.722

Project Preparation Studies                         0.020       0.650        0.670
Vehicles and Equipment                              0.008       0.075        0.083
Unallocated for Contingencies                         -         0.135        0.135
Total                                    0.300       2.500        2.800
The cost of one-advisor-year, excluding housing, has been estimated at about
US$84,000, corresponding to US$7,000 per month. The cost of one man-month
consultancy has been estimated at US$10,000. The above costs will include
some local expenditures such as advisers' local currency post adjustment
allowances and consultants' subsistence expenses. The project also provides
for the purchase of a limited number of vehicles and office equipment and
supplies to support the activities of the advisers. The Government will
provide office accommodation, secretarial assistance, counterpart salaries and
advisers' housing (Credit Agreement, Section 3.01).
Procurement and Disbursement:
47.       The selection of consultants will be in accordance with the Associa-
tion's normal procedures. P?rocurement of equipment and vehicles will be in
accordance with the borrower's normal procedures, which include soliciting
competitive bids from local suppliers, considered satisfactory to the Associa-
tion. The Association will disburse 100 percent of the salaries and emolu-
ments of advisers, consultancy services, training and project preparation
studies. The Association will also disburse 100 percent of foreign expendi-
tures for equipment and vehicles imported directly and 85 percent of local
expenditures for items procured locally. US$135,000 would remain unallocated
for contingencies. Disbursements will be fully documented.
Benefits and Risks
48.       The technical expertise, both in the form of long-term advisers
and short-term consultants, that would be provided under the proposed project
will help strengthen the Government's planning machinery and develop effective
planning units at the sectoral level. It will also assist the key sectoral
ministries to more effectively formulate and prepare specific investment
projects. Through its traiLning activities, the project will assist in



-16-
developing the self-reliance of government staff in managing the sectoral
planning units when the expatriate advisers leave. The project is also
designed to encourage smoother and greater cooperation between different
ministries. The primary risk involved is in the level of Government's commit-
ment to its own development goals as evidenced by the management of its
economy. The Government is now devoting increased attention to improving
its fiscal and external debt management. It will be important that Sierra
Leone should be in a position to move forward with a sound development
plan, with well-conceived sectoral policies and programs once the immediate
fiscal constraints are eased. There is also some element of risk in the
fact that the successful implementation of the project is contingent upon
the availability of suitable expatriate personnel. The involvement of the
Association should reduce this risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Sierra Leone and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
50.        In addition to the features of the Credit Agreement which are
referred to in the text and listed in Section III of Annex III a special
condition of effectiveness would be the establishment of a technical level
working committee (para. 45).
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 568-SL   Second Agricultural Project:  US$5 million
Credit of July 2, 1975 and US$5 million Loan
Loan No. 1138-SL    of July 2, 1975; Effective Date:  January 29,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
The project is designed to expand the IDA-financed first agricul-
tural project in the Eastern Province (under Credit No. 323-SL) and to ini-
tiate a new agricultural development project in the Northern Province of
Sierra Leone, increasing farm incomes through expanded production of swamp and
upland rice, cocoa, oil palm, establishment of permanent farm support ser-
vices, and provision of agricultural credit and infrastructural facilities.
The loan/credit was declared effective on January 29, 1976, waiving the
outstanding conditions of effectiveness with respect to recruitment of key
staff for the Northern Area Project and the Project Evaluation and Services
Unit. There were initial delays in the recruitment of senior project manage-
ment and technical staff dlue to difficulty in finding suitable candidates; as
a result, project implementation was slowed down. However, an experienced
project manager was appointed and has been in post since June 1977. A civil
engineer was also appointed and has been on the job since December 1977. Both
the Eastern and the Northern Area Project Management Units are adequately
staffed and continue to function well. Overall, the implementation of these
projects has progressed satisfactorily.
Credit No. 573-SL   Second Education Project:  US$7.25 million
Credit of July 29, 1975; Effective Date:
September 8, 1975; Closing Date: September 30,
1980.
The main compon,ents of the project are: construction of facilities
and provision of furniture, equipment and materials for secondary schools,
a secondary teacher college, trade schools, and for institutions for educa-
tional management and training; provision of technical assistance and fellow-
ships for further development of the sector. Contracts representing 90
percent of the civil works have been awarded. Bids for the remaining con-
struction work are expected to be invited shortly. Bids for civil works have
generally been within the appraisal estimates. The education components of
the project are progress:ing satisfactorily. Training courses for technical
teachers and for communilty development workers have started at the new facili-
ties, and curriculum development work and educational research work are well
under way. Project management continues to be efficient.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 734-SL   Third Power Project:  US$8.2 million
Credit of September 29, 1977; Effective
Date: March 29, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
The extension of the King Tom power plant (financed by IDA) has
already been completed and is in operation. Progress is being made towards
the implementation of the 33 KV grid (financed by BADEA) and the new generat-
ing units (financed by BADEA) for the provincial centers. The financial
management consultants have completed their studies and have submitted their
recommendations to SLEC's management. The consultants for the feasibility
studies of the Bumbuna hydroelectric scheme have completed the geological site
investigation and are now examining the technical and economic aspects of the
proposed hydropower scheme. It is expected that the feasibility studies will
be completed by spring 1980. Although some improvement has been achieved in
the technical operations of the corporation, there is no noticeable improve-
ment in its management. SLEC has not been able to fully address its fundamen-
tal weaknesses related to financial management and lack of qualified staff.
The required financial rate of return has not been achieved, but a proposal
for tariff increase has been submitted to Government.  SLEC will be in a
better financial position with improved staffing, as well as Government
approval of the proposed tariff increase and the timely settlement of Govern-
ment's electricity bills.
