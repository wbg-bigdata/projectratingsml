A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The development objective of the Social Risk Mitigation Project/Loan (SRMP), is to
mitigate the impact of the recent (February 2001) economic crisis on poor households (social risk
mitigation) and to improve their capacity to cope with similar risks in the future (social risk
management). The SRMP will achieve these objectives through: (i) an adjustment portion,
providing immediate support to the poorest affected by the crisis (social risk mitigation); and (ii)
an investmentportion, which consists of three components (a) building up the capacity of state
institutions providing basic social services and social assistance to the poor (social risk
management); (b) implementing a social assistance system (Conditional Cash Transfers - CCT)
targeted to the poorest 6 percent of the population conditional on improved use of basic health
and education services (social risk mitigation and prevention); and (c) increasing the income
generating and employment opportunities of the poor (social risk prevention).
The Government of Turkey is thus requesting the support of the World Bank in the form
of a hybrid loan of US $500 million for the SRMP to assist in the implementation of these
measures.  A key goal of the SRMP is to strengthen the social assistance system so that it
becomes cost-effective in Turkey and is better targeted to the poorest, and which will provide not
only a safety-net for the poor, but also a trampoline to help the poor escape poverty - a system
which not only mitigates social risk, but also helps to prevent and manage it. The SRMP will
also undergird the Government's overall economic reform program through mitigating social costs
for the poorest.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)

*  Number of income-generating sub-projects by poor beneficiary population.
*  Number of illiterate adults becoming functionally literate.
*  Number of unemployed youth trained.
*  Number of person-days of temporary community employment created.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: R2001-0113;IFC/R2001-0134         Date of latest CAS discussion: July 12,
2001
The updated CAS for Turkey is based on a three-pronged approach: (i) structural policies
aimed at correcting the weaknesses underlying the crisis and establishing a sounder basis for
disinflation and growth over the medium term; (ii) strong social policies including enhanced social
dialogue to achieve price and wage policies consistent with macroeconomic stability, and
increased emphasis on the protection of the most vulnerable groups of society; and (iii) fiscal and
monetary policies geared towards restoring financial stability and resuming the disinflation
process. Maintaining social cohesion is especially important given the political volatility and
social stresses of the country. The key elements supported by the SRMP are to:
*  reduce poverty in Turkey and strengthen the institutional environment for monitoring
poverty and taking appropriate policy actions; and
*  strengthen social protection for vulnerable groups through new social assistance
initiatives, including introducing new targeted social assistance programs for groups
affected by the crisis.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Macroeconomic Framework
Introduction
The Government reached agreement with the IMF in May on a new macro-economic
framework and policy package, including a detailed program of structural reforms worked out in
collaboration with the Bank, in response to the crisis set off by the failure of the exchange rate
peg in February 2001. To support the program, the IMF and World Bank are prepared to provide
up to US$ 10.0 billion in additional exceptional external financing in 2001. The 6th and 7th
- 3 -



reviews of the Stand-by arrangement were completed on May 15, 2001, resulting in the
disbursement of SDR 3 billion (US$ 3.9 billion) from the Fund. An augmentation of the Standby
amount by SDR 6.36 billion was also approved, bringing total IMF commitments for the program
since the Stand-by was approved in December 1999 to SDR 15.0 billion (over US$ 19.0 billion),
including the SDR 5.8 billion (US$ 7.5 billion) Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF) approved in
December 2000. The 8th program review was approved on July 12, 2001, resulting in the
disbursement of a further SDR 1.20 billion (US$ 1.5 billon). On the same day, the Bank's Board
discussed the CAS Progress Report which increases potential support for the program to US$ 6.2
billion, including US$ 1.2 billion on Special Structural Adjustment Loan (SSAL) terms. The
Board also approved the US$ 1.1 billion Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment
Loan (PFPSAL) and the US $600.0 million Agriculture Reform Implementation Project (ARIP).
The 9th IMF program review was completed on August 3, 2001 and the Fund has disbursed an
additional SDR 1.20 billion (US$ 1.5 billion). The Bank has begun preparation of a second
Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) which could go to the
Board in December 2001.
Economic Developments Leading up to the New Program
Original Disinflation Program.  The Government launched its original disinflation
program under near crisis conditions in mid-1999. The program aimed to bring inflation to single
digits and set the economy on a stable path of high growth. There were three core pillars: (i)
strong fiscal adjustment, including large privatization revenues, designed to put public finances on
a sustainable path; (ii) a crawling peg exchange rate anchor designed to lower inflationary
expectations and bring down interest rates; and (iii) deep structural reforms aimed at sustaining
fiscal adjustment and promoting productivity and growth. Structural reforms were focused on
measures to: (a) support privatization, particularly in the telecommunications and energy sectors;
(b) address fumdamental fiscal weaknesses, notably through pension reform, modernization of
agriculture support policies, and reform of public expenditure management including measures to
contain the rapid growth of contingent liabilities; and (c) strengthen the financial sector. The
initial results were encouraging, however, signs of problems soon appeared which pointed to the
underlying macro risks. The current account deficit began to widen rapidly. Throughout the
year, inflation outpaced the rate of crawl under the peg. Although CPI inflation fell to a 15-year
low of 39 percent by the end of 2000, this exceeded the 25 percent target, leading to real
exchange rate appreciation of about 14 percent. The Government did not respond quickly to the
widening macro imbalances and clear signs that the economy was overheating. Under the
quasi-currency board rules, the Central Bank (MB) refrained from sterilizing the capital inflows
which were driving down interest rates to exceptionally low levels below the targeted path. There
was little political support for additional fiscal measures when the primary surplus was exceeding
the program target. Structural reform implementation slowed perceptibly after mid year. The
Government was particularly slow in resolving problem private banks and restructuring the state
banks. The structural problems in the banking sector, highlighted in the Country Economic
Memorandum circulated to the Board in September 2000, were to play a central role in the
coming financial turmoil.

From Turmoil to Crisis. Turkey was hit by a first round of financial turmoil in
November 2000 brought on by the withdrawal of credit lines to Demir Bank, a key primary dealer
of government securities. The November crisis demonstrated the vulnerability of the Turkish
banking sector to exchange and interest rate risks, as well as the mismatch between the maturity
of assets and liabilities which had built up as a result of past macroeconomic distortions and
inadequate banking supervision and enforcement. It also highlighted the importance of growing
macroeconomic risks as a relatively isolated incident quickly escalated to a systemic problem. As
confidence fell, foreign portfolio investors withdrew funds, banking sector liquidity tightened, and
short-term interest rates shot up to over 1,000 percent. Large liquidity injections from the MB
did not calm the markets and resulted in a loss of about US$6.5 billion in reserves. This situation
put the banking sector under severe stress particularly the state banks which faced steep increases
in the costs of financing their chronic liquidity needs. Overall, the balance of risk shifted abruptly
from overheating and external imbalance to recession and financial sector crisis. The Government
responded with an effort to strengthen its reform program, but this effort fell short and, in late
February 2001, Turkey was hit by a full-fledged economic crisis. The fresh turmoil was ignited by
the public airing of political tensions. This set off a new wave of turbulence in the financial sector
as investors liquidated TL positions and fled to dollars in expectation of a government crisis. By
February 21, overnight rates were over 2,000 percent with minimal transaction volumes. The
next day, the Government announced the flotation of the Lira, effectively abandoning the original
disinflation program.
New Macroframework
Key Macroeconomic Targets. The principal macroeconomic objectives of the new program
are: first, to contain the impact of the collapse of the crawling peg and subsequent devaluation;
and second, to resume a path of progressively lower inflation and increasingly sustainable growth.
The macroeconomic targets for 2001 have been revised further in the context of the 9th Standby
review to take account of the outcome for the first half of the year. Table 1 compares the revised
baseline with the initial program projections announced in May. The main elements of the
macro-framework are summarized below and discussed in more detail in the following
paragraphs:
*  Based in part on higher-than-expected devaluation of the Lira (about 48 percent to date),
the projection for average CPI inflation (Dec-Dec) for the year has been revised upward to
58 percent, compared to the 52.5 percent initially projected; however, inflation is still
targeted to fall to about 2 percent per month (seasonally adjusted) by the end of 2001;
*  Nominal interest rates on government securities, now in the 90 percent range, are
projected to average to 91 percent for the year, resulting in average real rates of some 42
percent, substantially above the initial program projection of about 36 percent;
*  The contraction in GNP for 2001 has been revised downward to minus 5.5 percent,
compared to the fall of 3.0 percent initially projected, on the basis of the sharp (4.2
percent) fall in output during the first quarter and the higher-than-expected interest rates;
the economy is still expected to recover during the second half of the year on the basis of
strong export performance and tourism revenues;
- 5 -



*   Fiscal performance has been positive, despite the slowdown in the economy; the
consolidated public sector, including State Economic Enterprises, remains on track to
achieve the targeted primary surplus of 5.5 percent of GNP;
*   The end-year projection for the public debt to GNP ratio (net of MB net assets) has been
revised upward to 87 percent of GNP, compared to 79 percent in the initial program
baseline; this is the result of the higher domestic interest rates, higher devaluation and
lower growth realized during the first semester; the debt to GNP ratio is still projected to
fall rapidly in 2002-03;
*   The correction in the current account has been sharper than expected on the basis of a
very steep decline in imports (19 percent decline in US$ terms for the Jan-May period
compared to the same period in 2000) and a solid recovery in exports (9 percent increase
in US$ for the Jan-May period); as a result, a current account surplus of about US$ 5
billion is now projected for 2001 compared to the rough balance foreseen under the initial
program; however, the target for gross international reserves remains broadly unchanged
reflecting continued capital outflows;
*    Inflation  is still projected  to  fall sharply  in  2002-03  and  the  economy  is projected  to
recover as strongly as in the initial program baseline; however, the actual pace and extent
of recovery will depend sensitively on a sustained reduction in interest rates.

Interest Rates. The program has not restored confidence to the market as quickly or as
effectively as expected.  After falling to below  80 percent in late May, interest rates on
government bonds increased again in June and July, reaching a peak of 109 percent on the
benchmark March 2002 bond on July 12, before subsiding somewhat to the 90 percent range at
present (Figure 1). Spreads on Turkish eurobonds have also eased from the highs reached in
mid-July. However, current rates on domestic government securities are still well above the
initially programmed path. A major source of the problem has been continuing concerns about
the Government's commitment to the program. While the Government has implemented an
impressive array of reform measures, both macroeconomic and structural, internal debates within
the Cabinet have spilled over into public quarrels. Moreover, the Governmnent was late in meeting
certain commitmnents for the 8th program review and the PFPSAL, including appointment of a
new professional Board and management team for Turk Telekom and intervention in
undercapitalized private banks unable to present credible recapitalization plans. Although the
Government eventually met all of its commnitments, the perception of internal disagreements and
indecision dissipated the expected boost in market confidence. Macroeconomic factors, including
market confusion about the Government's policy on intervention in the foreign exchange market
and contagion effects from other emerging markets in difficulty, have also played a role in the
persistence of high interest rates.
Inflation and Growth. The program target of 2 percent monthly inflation (seasonally
adjusted) by the end of 2001 remains within reach due to a combination of the sharp slowdown in
the economy and the tight demand management policies under the program. While inflation
exceeded program targets during the first semester, in part due to somewhat larger than expected
devaluation, the outcome for June (3.1 percent for the CPI) was in line with program projections
and monthly inflation subsided further in July (2.4 percent for the CPI). For the year as a whole
-- 7-



(December to December), the projection for CPI inflation has been increased to 58 percent.
However, the objective for the coming 12 months (June 2001 to June 2002) is in the 30-35
percent range.  Reaching this goal will depend on the effectiveness of the program's
macroeconomic policies in lowering inflationary expectations. On the real side, the Bank has
carried out a corporate sector assessment to evaluate the impact of the crisis on the business
community. Virtually all indicators point to a steep decline in economic activity since the onset of
the crisis. Real GNP declined by 4.2 percent in the first quarter; private sector capacity utilization
was a low 66 percent in June 2001, compared to 78 percent a year earlier, and the index of
industrial production is similarly depressed. Surveys cite lower domestic demand as the biggest
factor and indicate that the majority of firms reduced their workforce in the first quarter,
contributing to the sharp increase in the officially recorded unemployment rate to 8.5 percent.
Official projections for GNP growth rates for 2001 as a whole have been revised downward to
minus 5.5 percent. However, this still assumes a strong recovery during the second semester
(with seasonally adjusted quarterly growth rates in the 2-2.5 percent range) which in turn will
depend on the behavior of interest rates and continued strong export performance. Similarly, the
strong recovery projected under the program in 2002-03 will depend on sustained improvement in
the financial markets and in the corporate sector.
Fiscal Performance. Fiscal performance is on track to generate the targeted 5.5 percent
of GNP primary surplus of the consolidated public sector. Certain expenditures, e.g. wages and
salaries, will increase as a result of the higher inflation. Moreover, spending on social assistance
by the Social Solidarity Fund will be increased by some TL 125 trillion (about US$ 100 million),
relative to the TL 425 trillion envelope agreed under the PFPSAL, as a result of the
quick-disbursing component of the SRMP. The increased expenditure will be compensated by a
projected modest over-performance on the revenue side due in part to higher than expected
revenues from withholding taxes on interest income. It is important to note, however, that
revenue on interest income can be expected to decline over time if interest rates fall as projected.
Achieving the 6.5 percent of GNP primary surplus targets for 2002-03 will be a serious challenge
of the Government's political will and the fiscal outcome will depend critically on the extent and
speed of the projected economic recovery.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy. The Government is undertaking additional
measures to clarify and strengthen monetary and exchange rate policies under the program. The
authorities intend to introduce inflation targeting as a new nominal anchor for the program in the
fourth quarter of 2001. In the interim, base money will remain the main instrument for disinflation
and revised targets for base money have been established as part of the 9th program review. The
shift to inflation targeting is not without risks and will require careful management. Turkey's
attempt to do so in a high inflation environment is largely unprecedented. Pressures emanating
from the going fiscal adjustment process and the bank restructuring program will pose furither
challenges for inflation targeting. With regard to exchange rate policy, the MB will continue to
sell foreign exchange to sterilize the inflows from IFIs to the budget. The MB will place all such
external support in a special account and the portion used for domestic payments will be sold in
pre-announced auctions. The MB may also continue to intervene from time to time to smooth
temporary exchange rate fluctuations. However, such intervention will be infrequent and in both
directions, consistent with the floating exchange rate regime. These steps aim to reduce market
- 8 -



uncertainty about the authorities' exchange rate policy, thereby helping to ease pressure on
interest rates, but their effectiveness will depend on credible implementation.
External Balances. The correction in the current account has been more rapid and more
extensive than initially projected under the program, in large part due to the impact of the
recession on demand and the larger-than-expected drop in the Lira. Through May, the current
account ran a small surplus of just over US$ 300.0 million, compared to the US$ 4.0 billion
deficit registered in 2000. Imports (fob) have fallen sharply and are now projected to reach US$
42.0 billion for the year, US$ 12.0 billion less than in 2000. The fall in imports is an indicator of
the extent of the falloff in domestic demand since the onset of the crisis and the depth of the
recession. On the other hand, export performnance has been encouraging. For the year, exports
(fob) are now projected to exceed US$ 35.0 billion, almost US$ 4.0 billion above the 2000 level.
Tourism receipts are projected to reach US$ 8.5 billion for the year, about US$ 1.0 billion higher
than in 2000 and a record for Turkey. The current account is projected to return to rough balance
in 2002-03 in line with the initial program projections.

The gross reserve targets for the program remain broadly unchanged, despite the
improved current account balance, reflecting a higher level of capital outflows. The details of the
updated external financing plan are given in Table 2. With regard to the initial external financing
plan in May (as presented in Annex B 11 of the Turkey CAS Progress Report-Report No.
R2001-0113;IFC/R2001-0134), the major changes are for 2001, with private capital inflows in
2002-03 projected to recover to levels adequate to repay the IMF and rebuild reserves as per the
initial program. The major revisions for 2001 relative to the initial external financing plan are as
follows:
* US$ 6.0 billion reduction in gross financing requirements, due essentially to the improved
outlook for the current account;
- 10 -



*  US$ 2.5 billion increase in net FDI inflows as a result of investment in the 3rd mobile
phone network (Is-Tim) and recently announced mergers and purchases of domestic banks
by foreign banks;
*  US$ 1.5 billion increase in net portfolio investment outflows reflecting primarily a
reduction in expected new borrowing by the public sector;
*  US$ 4.0 billion increase in net short-term debt outflows, mainly due to reduced rollover of
foreign bank credits to domestic banks; and
*  US$ 3.0 billion increase in unrecorded outflows, a potential signal of significant capital
flight.
Program Risks and Mitigating Measures
As discussed in the June 2001 CAS Progress Report, the economic program is subject to
significant risks which must be mitigated. Among the most important risk factors are sustained
political support for the program and macroeconomic vulnerabilities, notably those linked to
public debt sustainability and exteinal vulnerability. Political risks are heightened by the social
pressures arising from the crisis. These pressures contributed to internal debates in June within
the Cabinet on the implementation of certain reform measures including the level of wheat support
prices, a new wage agreement for public sector workers and legislation reforming the tobacco
sector. These debates continued in July over the appointment of the new Board and management
for Turk Telekom. Following the resignation of several ministers, the leaders of the coalition
parties have renewed their commitment to the program and there is a perception of renewed
cohesiveness. Going forward, increased emphasis on the social dimensions will be essential to
sustaining political support for what is in the end a painful stabilization and adjustment program.
The Bank is playing an important role in helping Turkey mitigate the social risks. The
Government's commitment to protect social expenditure under the PFPSAL is a cornerstone of
this effort and it will be important for the Government to extend this commitment into 2002-03.
The strengthening of the social safety net envisaged under the SRMP is another core element of
the Government's strategy for mitigating the social impact of the program. Other elements of the
strengthened social policy include the direct income support to farmers under the ARIP and
support for workers displaced by privatization under the Privatization Social Support Project
(PSSP).
Macroeconomic Risks. The macroeconomic framework and targets are ambitious given
the extent of the current crisis. Interest rates will need to fall rapidly to ensure market willingness
to rollover the public debt in the near term, and the decline in rates will have to be maintained in
order to ensure the sustainability of the public debt over the medium term. The actual path of real
interest rates will depend critically on the effectiveness of macro-economic policies and the
Government's domestic borrowing requirements. A critical factor in achieving the projected
levels of nominal and real interest rates is control over inflationary expectations. This must be
achieved through a combination of: (i) overall credibility of the program and its political
leadership, including sustained commitment to structural reform; (ii) a well coordinated incomes
policy to limit inflationary wage adjustments; (iii) tight monetary policy, (iv) strong fiscal
adjustment to contain the public deficit; and (v) the large package of exceptional financing from
the IFIs to help finance the costs of the bank crisis and limit public sector borrowing in the
- 11 -



domestic bond market. Actual growth performance will depend sensitively on how successfully
this policy package is implemented. Limiting the contraction in GNP for 2001 to the revised
projection of minus 5.5 percent hinges on a sharp turnaround in economic activity in the second
semester. The actual extent of recovery in 2002-03 will play an important role in the public debt
dynamics as will the fiscal outcome. Although difficult, the Government has implemented
belt-tightening measures to reach the 5.5 percent of GNP primary surplus target for 2001.
Tightening further to 6.5 percent of GNP in 2002-03 will require fundamental structural changes
in the public sector.
Debt Sustainability. Table 3 presents the evolution of the public debt under the program
macro-framework as revised for the 9th Standby review. Under this baseline scenario, all of the
key public debt indicators-debt to GNP ratio, interest payments as a share of GNP, domestic
debt amortization, and the PSBR--fall rapidly after 2001. As shown in the top right side of the
table, this trajectory is a result of the sharp fall in interest rates and strong recovery projected
under the program. Another key variable is the average maturity of new Treasury borrowing in
the domestic market-which has been steadily shrinking over the past year and is currently in the
six month range. In the baseline, the maturity of new borrowing is projected to increase rapidly in
concert with the fall in  interest rates.   If the program  objectives of increased  market
confidence-with the attendant improvements in interest rates and maturity of new
borrowing-and restored growth do not materialize, then the debt dynamics will be substantially
more difficult.

The Government is taking a number of new measures in the context of the 9th review
which it hopes will promote rollover of the public debt in the coming months. However,
continued implementation of the core structural reform agenda remains key to building the market
confidence needed to ensure that the public debt can be rolled over on a sustained basis. The new
measures, announced in late July, include:
*   Payment of up to two-thirds (TL 5 quadrillion) of interest coming due to the state banks
until the end of 2001 in new securities bearing market interest rates; the remaining
one-third (TL 2.5 quadrillion) will be paid in cash as initially planned;
*   Restructuring of some TL  14 quadrillion in short-term  securities bearing quarterly
coupons, purchased by the MB from the state and SDIF banks, into longer-term (2-6 year)
- 12 -



debt with annual interest payments;
*  Increase in withholding taxes on repos, short-term deposits, and FX deposits, combined
with reductions in the rates on longer-term TL deposits;
*  Reduction in the levy on foreign credits from 6 percent to 3 percent;
*  Introduction of remuneration for required bank reserves by the MB;
*  Increase in the threshold for income tax declarations for income from government
securities (corrected for inflation) from TL 5 billion to TL 50 billion.
The conversion of short-term government securities purchased by the MB from the state
and SDIF banks into long-term debt and the reintroduction, albeit temporarily, of non-cash
interest payments to the state banks are significant changes from the initial program strategy
agreed in May. These measures may in practice help improve market sentiment by reducing the
near-term rollover burden for the Treasury, but they may also complicate the transition to inflation
targeting and slow the pace of bank restructuring. The Government is well aware of the latter
risk and has adopted contingencies to ensure that state bank liquidity needs are not compromised.
More critical to building confidence in the program, the Government is moving ahead with
structural reforms including the financial and public sector reforms agreed under the PFPSAL
program and the actions to improve the climate for the private sector under the Economic Reform
Loan (ERL). Key structural benchmarks for the coming months include the submission to the
Parliament of a new public procurement law, resolution of the intervened banks under the SDIF
and progress in restructuring of the state banks with the view towards their early privatization,
appointment of the new regulatory Board for the energy sector, and adoption of a corporatization
plan by the new Turk Telekom Board designed to improve the company's operational
performance and prepare it for successful privatization.
External Vulnerability. Turkey's extemal vulnerability is exemplified by the large gross
financing requirements of some US$ 18-21 billion projected over 2002-03 (Table 2) which now
represent a greater proportion of GNP after the devaluation. The external debt stock at the end
of 2000 is estimated to be US$ 114 billion (57 percent of GNP) of which about US$ 29 billion
was short-term. With the increase in capital outflows, the stock of external debt is now projected
to fall slightly to US$ 113 billion in 2001 (with the short-term debt stock falling sharply to US$
18 billion). However, as a result of the greater-than-expected devaluation, this will equal 72
percent of GNP, cornpared to 66 percent in the initial program projections. Strong export
performance is projected to keep the debt service ratio to about 45 percent in 2001, in line with
the initial program. While improving thereafter, the debt service ratio is projected to remain close
to 40 percent through 2003. The increased level of capital outflows projected for 2001 indicates
that the program's efforts to encourage private sector involvement (PSI), i.e., "bail in" by private
creditors, have had little impact so far. Looking ahead, the extent to which Turkish banks and
enterprises will be able to rollover their external obligations will remain an important determinant
for the program. Slowing the capital outflow, and then reversing this trend in 2002-03, will be
instrumental in relieving pressure on the exchange rate and creating the conditions for a sustained
decline in domestic interest rates to sustainable levels. The exceptional financing from the IFIs in
2001 is providing Turkey with needed support at this critical juncture, but a return of investor
confidence will be essential to ultimate success of the program. Were the capital account to
recover more slowly than expected, Turkey does have the option of requesting the IMF to extend
- 13 -



the maturity of the maturing SRF resources for an additional year.
The large capital outflows in 2001--coming on top of the large inflows under the original
disinflation program in 2000--underscore the extent of Turkey's exposure to sudden shifts in the
confidence of intemational financial markets. At the same time, the country is faced with an
important opportunity. Most of the projected capital outflow is in the form of short-term debt
and portfolio investment. The coverage of short-term debt by official reserves-an important
indicator of external vulnerability--actually improves under the revised baseline compared to the
initial program projections, although it remains well below desirable levels (Table 1). To the
extent that Turkey is able to replace a significant share of the "hot money" outflow with longer
term inflows--especially FDI--over the medium term, the country's external vulnerability will be
permanently reduced.  In this regard, the recently announced investments by foreign banks in
Turkey's financial sector is an encouraging sign.
Poverty and Social Impact of the Crisis
The social impact of the crisis is already being felt as lay-offs, rising prices, and negative
economic growth reduce household incomes, and increase the risk of poverty on the poor. The
landless poor in rural areas have been affected by a decline in construction and other informal job
opportunities, a problem that has also severely affected the urban poor also. Meanwhile the poor
with land are beset by increased input costs due to inflation.
A full social assessment for the SRMP has been completed (see Annex 14). The main
findings are:
*  Qualitative evidence on withdrawal of children from school. Field visits were undertaken
to Eastern Anatolia, Southern Anatolia, Central Anatolia, Istanbul slums, Ankara slums and
the Black Sea region. When asked in the absence of officials (and sometimes even in the
presence of officials although it is illegal in Turkey to keep a child from school), the poor have
replied that because of the crisis they are not going to be able to send their children to school
in September, illegal or not. So there is an imminent danger of the destruction of human
capital.  Additionally, Ministry of Health (SB) staff in Ankara and the field report
underutilization of preventative care by poor families.
* Out-of-pocket school expenditures are larger than anticipated. In Turkey, compulsory
education through grade 8 is free of charge. However, at least in Istanbul, some public
schools asked for donations during registration in school year 2000-2001 of about TL 20
million per child (nearly US$ 30 at the December 2000 exchange rate). Rural families
repeatedly stressed the cost of appropriate clothing for children, particularly shoes and winter
coats.
* Child labor as a coping device among the poorest families. The poorest families are forced
to mobilize all possible members as income earners to contribute to family income, even if
they are children. In the Duragan area of Sinop province, families send boys as young as 9 to
work for low wages in agriculture. In the major cities, children work in the informal sector,
- 14 -



and certain cities (including Istanbul, Gaziantep, Diyarbikar) have significant groups of street
children.
*  Changed consumption patterns of food. As a coping strategy to the crisis, many poor
families reported drastic changes in their consumption pattem of food, cutting back sharply on
meat, fresh fruits, vegetables, and tea. The worse cases reported that they were subsiding
almost exclusively on bread.
*  Profile of extreme poverty. Poor families with many children, are at especial risk of extreme
poverty, particularly in rural areas and in poor families where the main breadwinner (the
husband) is disabled, dead, or absent for military service. Other groups at risk are single
elderly living alone with no social insurance and recent migrants to urban slum areas.
Fieldwork undertaken in May 2001 for the Corporate Sector Assessment indicates that:
* The initial perception is that the crisis is unprecedented in its severity and impact on
industry in comparison to previous crisis due, in part, to the spillover effects of the
problems caused by the Russian crisis in 1998-1999, the Marmara earthquake in 1999 and
the November 2000 crisis;
* Small and medium enterprises(some 65 percent of SMEs surveyed) are laying off
workers, while larger firms are using accelerated vacation schedules, shortened
work-weeks and other methods to avoid formalized layoffs; and
v Both banks and business owners confirm that credit is generally not available, except to
the best customers and even then for 90 days or less. Interest rates are very high, in US
dollar terms at 15-18 percent.
In March 2001, a simulation of the impact of the crisis on the welfare distribution was
undertaken, using household data from 1994, to identify the characteristics of the most vulnerable
households. This simulation suggested five patterns of likely increased poverty as a result of the
February 2001 financial crisis: (i) families with many children (widows with many children are
particularly vulnerable and extended families with many children, as well as single-parent families,
seem to be the most affected in terms of high rates and high increases in food poverty; (ii) an
increase in unemployment disproportionately affect families with many children; (iii) those with
moderate levels of education seem more likely to become vulnerable-but still above the food
poverty line-while the least educated are those most likely to become food poor; and (iv) the
urban population seems more at risk (vulnerable) of slipping into food poverty as they have no
access to small food plots to complement meagre cash incomes; and (v) families with reduced
income have responded to the crisis by reducing consumption, shifting to lower cost and quality
food, postponing purchases of durables, and more worryingly, proposing to keep their children
back from school due to the out-of-pocket expenses such as uniform, shoes, books and stationery.
- 15 -



The Government is responding to this situation with a package structural reforms designed
to help pull the economy out of recession and restore growth as soon as possible, which is the key
to minimizing job loss, and the social and poverty impact of the crisis. Restored confidence in the
financial sector will help reverse the on-going credit crunch and generate new resources for
economic recovery and job creation. The public sector reforms will help ensure the quality of the
fiscal adjustment and improve overall efficiency of social service delivery.  Better public
expenditure management will increase the availability of resources for social expenditures.
Actions to upgrade the operational performance of line ministries and agencies, including
increased emphasis on policy formulation and a progressive shift to performance budgeting, will
help ensure that these additional resources are used effectively to fight poverty and vulnerability.
Action under the program to improve public governance and tackle corruption are likely to
benefit the poor disproportionately as shown in numerous international studies. Structural reform
of the financial and public sectors is also crucial to avoid future crisis which would likely be
devastating for the poor.
Protecting Social Expenditures
The Government is strengthening Turkey's social protection programs (including through
the support of the SRMP) and is committed to protecting social spending under the PFPSAL
program. Protecting expenditure on health, education and social protection from the impact of
the crises is a key social objective. Otherwise, Turkey's human capital will suffer and the burden
of adjustment will fall on vulnerable groups. A supplementary budget for 2001 was approved by
Parliament in June which is consistent with the Government's macroeconomic objectives and also
ensures adequate expenditure envelopes for health, education and social protection. The budget
maintains aggregate spending on education slightly above the average levels of 1998-2000 (as a
share of GNP) and programs a significant increase in expenditure on social protection relative to
2000, resulting in part from the launch of the Direct Income Support (DIS) program for farmers.
The preliminary outcome for spending on health, education and social protection under the 2001
budget will be monitored in October. Benchmarks for public spending on health, education and
social protection have been set at a level above the averages for the 1998-2000 period, reflecting
the Government's policy decision to ensure adequate expenditure on social priorities.

Strengthening the social safety-net.
Social Insurance. The Government is working to improve the social safety-net, and
especially to reform the social security system. The reforms are necessary because the system is
insolvent and the level of benefits is not sustainable. The first phase of social security reform
consists of modifications to the public pay-as-you-go pension system to stem operating losses,
including raising the retirement age for new entrants. The second phase of the social security
reform strategy, planned for 2001, focuses on strengthening the organizational underpinnings of
the system, extending its coverage, separating the pension system from associated health
insurance and unemployment schemes, and eliminating accumulated arrears. The third phase is to
introduce a framework for supplementary individual pension schemes. These reforms will bring
forward a more targeted and sustainable social security system for old-age, but will only insure
against one kind of risk - that of inadequate savings in old-age.
The existing severance payment system which covers both public and private enterprises
continues to operate and is being strengthened by the Bank-financed PSSP. The unemployment
insurance program, introduced as part of the reform of the public pension system in August 1999,
will begin to make payments to the enrolled unemployed in early 2002 and thus is not addressed
by the SRMP. The Government is moving quickly to expand targeted social assistance to those
- 17 -



groups most affected by the crisis. This support will include programs to protect vulnerable
families (such as assistance with food, medicine and social services) supported directly by the
SRMP.
Limitations of Social Insurance. Social insurance (pensions and disability) are tied to an
individual having a job in the formal sector. With the exception of the Bag-Kur social insurance
plan for the self-employed, the whole social security system is linked to holding a formal job
(including the newly-introduced unemployment insurance). Such a system runs the distinct risk of
excluding those without a connection to the formal labor market. In the 1994 Living Standards
Assessment, it was demonstrated that households headed by seasonal or casual workers (workers
without a labor contract) were at high risk of poverty and economic vulnerability, and that
approximately one out of four workers in Turkey are casual employees. Turkey's social
protection system lacks a benefit that would be targeted to these vulnerable groups.
A comprehensive social safety-net helps to insure against the risks of unemployment and
poverty. Unfortunately, there are several large gaps in the social safety-net in Turkey. Turkey
has only recently adopted unemployment benefits, but due to the period of required contributions,
people will not be able to draw unemployment benefits until 2002. So, those who become jobless
as a result of the economic crisis or reforms will not have unemployment insurance to support
them while they search for other jobs. Social assistance is not comprehensive in Turkey but rather
ad hoc, patchy, limited and underfunded.
Turkey's existing Social Assistance is quite limited. Turkey does not have a poverty
benefit--a cash transfer that is targeted to the vulnerable--which could be used to help those
negatively affected by the reform. Social assistance in Turkey is limited to ad hoc assistance in
kind channeled through the 931 SYDVs, and limited programs for the elderly and disabled under
Law 2022, as well as institutional care for children and the elderly administered by SHCEK.
Turkey has no other cash transfers that could help the vulnerable, unlike many neighboring
countries of Western and Eastern Europe, which have universal child allowances. The 1994
Living Standards Assessment for Turkey found that the presence of children in a household does
increase the risk of poverty substantially. Children under 10 years old have the highest poverty
risk among all age groups. CCT would fill this gap by providing an incentive to poor parents to
keep their children in school and for pre-school children to be regularly taken to health clinics, as
well as providing limited income support to the poorest households.
Using the Social Safety-net to Protect Human Capital
Turkey's social indicators do not compare favorably with other middle income countries
(see Selected Social Indicators - Country Comparison below). In particular, infant and maternal
mortality in Turkey is quite high for a middle-income country and female literacy is noticeably
lower than the comparator countries (except for Tunisia). Life expectancy at birth is equal to
Tunisia and lower than the other countries. These facts point out the importance of interventions
in health and education, especially education of women. The Bank has been working in
partnership with Turkey on the supply side of these interventions, with several projects in
education (including basic education) and health. However, to date, there have been limited
- 18 -



efforts on the demand side, mostly in the form of public information campaigns, which have not
had much effect on these social indicators. The SRMP will help to fill this gap on the demand
side by creating an incentive for poor households to keep their children in school and monitored
by the health system--the conditional cash transfers. CCT are an important tool in the country's
arsenal for improving these social indicators, since better education (particularly female
education) has been linked to improved health indicators for mothers and children and higher
household income.

Government Actions
The Government of Turkey has undertaken several key actions to strengthen the institutional basis
for the SRMP and to prepare to implement the SRMP. These actions have been completed in
advance of the Board presentation of the SRMP, in accordance with the negotiated commitment
of the Govermment as follows:
*   Transfer of TL40 million by Treasury to SYDTF for the procurement of school attendance
packages
*   Letter of Sector Policy (LSP) signed.
*   Project Operational Manual (POM) approved by Government.
*   Draft legislation  submitted  to  Parliament strengthening  the SYDTF  and organizational
structure and SYDV reporting practices, and enabling the SYDTF and SYDVs to work more
effectively with NGOs.
*   SYDTF issued circular (on the SRMP) to the SYDVs and signed a Participating Agency
Agreement for the investment portion with SHCEK and DIE.
*   Implementation Agreement for the adjustment portion signed by the Treasury and CBT.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Poverty Reduction. The SRMP seeks to alleviate poverty in two ways--combatting the
transient deterioration of living standards resulting from the crisis for the most vulnerable groups
(the "safety-net") and expanding opportunities for the poor to escape from poverty (the
"trampoline"). The World Bank's Living Standards Assessment (2000 - based upon 1994 data)
found that absolute food poverty in Turkey was relatively low at less than 6 percent of the
population.  The absolute poor are the target group for the quick-disbursing and CCT
components of the SRMP. However, the Living Standards Assessment found that about 36
percent of the population were economically vulnerable. This is the target group for the local
initiatives component, which seeks to lift people out of poverty through income-generating
activities,adult literacy, and youth employment.
Poverty Monitoring. Turkey lacks reliable household data on the impact of the February
financial crisis. The DIE cancelled the 2001 household income and expenditure survey for
methodological reasons and the previous survey was conducted in 1994. To fill this critical gap in
knowledge, the World Bank is co-financing a household survey partly from its operational budget,
with the remainder of the support from the Government of Japan (PHRD Grant). This household
survey is being conducted by local consultants drawing on the Middle East Technical University
(ODTU) with technical assistance from the World Bank. The household survey will provide the
data necessary for these key indicators: (i) poverty levels and household consumption; (ii) profile
of poverty; (iii) access to health and educational services by the poor and non-poor; (iv) poverty
correlates which will be combined into a scoring formula that will be used in SRMP components;
(v) extensive information on health indicators; and (vi) limited inforrnation on labor and
unemployment (DIE has a regular program of labor force surveys).
Additionally, the institutional strengthening component of the SRMP provides for
financing of two additional household surveys over the next four years with interviews and data
en,try conducted by consultants to the State Institute of Statistics (DIE). Finally, a rigorous
impact evaluation of the conditional cash transfers (CCT) component of the SRMP will be
conducted, including a baseline and follow-up survey. Targeting criteria for the CCT and Local
Initiatives component will be updated to take into account these new sources of statistical
information and to ensure that as the poverty profile changes, the targeting criteria will be
adjusted.
Social Policies. Stronger social policies are a linchpin of the program to help deal with
social hardships.  It is important for social cohesion that the Government moves towards
addressing the impact of the February financial crisis on the most vulnerable. The SRMP provides
a multi-faceted vehicle for the Government to address the crisis both quickly, through the Rapid
Response component, and more lastingly, by building strong social assistance institutions and by
expanding the range of available interventions to encompass CCT and increased local initiatives
including income-generating activities and adult literacy through the other components of the
SRMP.
Social Services. In 2001, spending on imnrmunization/vaccination programs will be
increased in real terms within the overall budget ceiling. The Governrment intends to protect
- 20 -



public expenditure on education, as well as increase the public health budget while reducing waste
within the overall health budget. Moving beyond 2001, the Government sees the need to develop
social services for vulnerable and at-risk population groups including abandoned children/orphans,
unemployed youth, illiterate adults, disabled, abused woman, and the elderly. SHCEK will take
the lead role in these areas. The SRMP will strengthen such social services through the Local
Initiatives component, and also increasing the poor's utilization of basic health and education on
services through the CCT.
Danger of Disinvestment in Human Capital.  Preliminary indications from  the
forthcoming Social Assessment and task team field visits confirm that there is a looming danger of
disinvestment in the human capital of children in poor households as a result of the financial crisis.
CCT are an important tool to combat this danger, by giving parents an incentive to keep their
children in school and attended regularly at health clinics by covering part of the out-of-pocket
costs incurred.
Strategic Choices
a. Unified operation or separate operations. The SRMP is designed as an integrated
operation, combining four strongly inter-related components instead of having four separate
operations, namely focusing on: (i) adjustment (Rapid Response); (ii) technical assistance (TA)
(Institutional Development component); (iii) CCT operation; and (iv) a social fund (Local
Initiatives component). There were two major considerations for making the SRMP into an
integrated operation. One concern was timing and logistics. The Government wants to move as
rapidly as possible to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis and to take the opportunity at the
same time to strengthen the social safety-net. Trying to prepare four separate operations
simultaneously would have overtaxed both the Government and the Bank task teams. A second
most important issue was the concern that the Rapid Response component (including its
conditionality) not be divorced from the overall strengthening of the social safety-net which is
necessary so that Turkey will be better able to cope with possible economic downturns in the
future.
b. Use of an existing institution or building a new institution. When designing the
SRMP, various alternatives for the institutional placement of the SRMP were considered. The
basic choice was between working with an existing institution, the SYDTF, or creating an entirely
new institution such as a extra-governmental social fund. There are strong arguments against
creating a completely new institution: time, ownership, and past track record. It takes significant
time and effort to build a new government agency, and the SRMP was prepared in a very tight
time frame. Next, ownership is best created by working with existing agencies. Third, the
SYDTF has a strong track record both in micro-projects and social assistance provision across the
country, and with cash payments in the Marmara earthquake region.
c. Supply-side interventions. Given the need to maintain the poor's access to health and
education services in the aftermath of the February financial crisis, supply-side interventions such
as increasing places in school or staffing at health clinics were considered. However, Turkey has
several Bank-financed projects in both health and education that are working on reducing
- 21 -



supply-side constraints.  Expanding these supply-side efforts would probably not increase
utilization by the poor enough, since the poor face constraints on their income which affects their
demand for and ability to use social services. What Turkey lacks is an incentive to the poor so
that they will use the available services. This demand-side incentive is provided in the SRMP's
CCT component.
d. Workfare (temporary community employment). Given that Turkey lacks a poverty
or welfare benefit, a basic choice was between protecting the human capital of the poor by
conditional cash transfers or creating a large-scale workfare program, whereby able-bodied adults
are employed in temporary public works at low wages. The SRMP does provide scope for
workfare/temporary community employment initiatives under the Local Initiatives component and
the Turkish government appreciates this window for increasing local temporary community
employment efforts. However, a full-scale workfare program instead of the SRMP was not
viewed as practical or as responding as directly to the impact of the crisis on children. The rural
areas are also highly vulnerable to the effects of the crisis, but it would be quite difficult to run
public works programs outside of the urban areas. Additionally, the Turkish experience with local
public works programs through the SYDVs suggest that it would be quite difficult to scale up
programs significantly. It would be difficult to target workfare well in terms of keeping the wage
offered low enough, since Turkish law mandates the payment of the minimum wage and social
taxes but actually, wages in the informal sector are much lower than the minimum wage. It would
require legislative action to offer a workfare wage lower than the minimum wage which might be
quite difficult to achieve from a political economy perspective. Existing temporary community
employment programs (as in the earthquake zone) have built up the expectations of beneficiaries
who have been extremely frustrated when the temporary employment has ended, and have
demanded ongoing employment creating a political economy problem. Finally, workfare does not
reach the poorest of the poor, who are not able-bodied or work-able. For these reasons, it was
considered best to keep workfare (temporary community employment) as an option in the SRMP
through the Local Initiatives component, but not to press forward for a large-scale workfare
program at the present time.
e. Targeting. The SRMP uses two different kinds of targeting for delivering its two
major assistance components--the existing community-based targeting mechanism of the SYDV
for the adjustment portion (Rapid Response) and a new targeting mechanism, a proxy-means test
scoring formula for CCT and Local Initiatives. For the adjustment portion, it was not possible to
use geographical targeting because the affected population is distributed across the country, and is
not exclusively rural (such as in Mexico where geographical targeting to rural areas is used). In
Turkey, even the best-off areas such as Istanbul have large pockets of poverty in urban slum
communities (gecekondu). For the CCT and Local Initiatives, a proxy-means test scoring fornula
was adopted that would give adequate weight to location as part of the score. However, for the
CCT, both Government and SRMP loan resources are limited, and it would not be possible to
provide CCT to all the rural population. Some way to discriminate between the extreme poor and
not-so-extremely poor is required such as afforded by a scoring formula. The team was able to
work with the 1994 data to develop a scoring formula, and as part of this operation, a household
survey of 4,000 households is being fielded to generate the data necessary to assess poverty in
Turkey and to devise a more current scoring formula. The same scoring formula with a different
- 22 -



eligibility level will be used as part of the selection criteria for individuals applying for Local
Initiatives micro-grants.
C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The SRMP as a hybrid loan has an adjustment portion (Rapid Response) and an
investment portion, with three strongly complementary components:
*  Adjustment Portion - Rapid Response (US$ 100.0 million, of which the Bank Loan
is equal to US$100.0 million): The adjustment portion of the SRMP will provide
quick-disbursing budget support against the Bank's standard negative list. The TL
equivalent funds will be used to support key programs of the SYDTF targeted to the
poorest households in a single disbursement, inter alia: (i) school attendance packs
(uniforms, shoes, stationery, textbooks ); (ii) pharmaceuticals and medical supplies the
poor people who are not able to pay for health expenses; and (iii) expansion of existing
social assistance programs (including family food and heating support) to meet the
increased real needs generated by the crisis. The Government has signed a Letter of
Sector Policy (LSP - Annex 11) on August 15, 2001 on social risk mitigation, social
assistance and poverty reduction. Conditions for the Tranche Release of the
adjustment portion of the Loan would be: (i) satisfactory macroeconomic
framework, as measured on the basis of indicators agreed between the Bank and the
Government of Turkey; and (ii) satisfactory progress in the carrying out of the
program as defined in the LSP. Treasury has already transferred an amount of TL
40 million to the SYDTF for the procurement of school attendance packages for poor
children which need to be distributed by the beginning of the school year on
September 11, 2001.
*  Institutional Development (US$ 36.61 million, of which Bank US$ 30.48 million):
The SRMP would strengthen the institutional capacity of key government agencies to
improve the coverage and targeting of the social safety-net for the poor. Key
elements include strengthening: (i) policy research, monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
capacities; (ii) MIS & Information Technology (IT) development; (iii) staff
development and training; and (iv) public information campaigns for both SHCEK and
the SYDTF/SYDVs. The capacity of DIE to monitor poverty through more frequent
HIES will be developed and to undertake poverty mapping based upon the Census.
This component will also support the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within the
SYDTF, which will oversee the implementation of the SRMP, including the financing
of all the Financial Management System (FMS), per-audit, documentary reviews and
operational reviews, M&E studies, and beneficiary assessments. This would include
the provision of TA, training, computer and other equipment for the MIS to the
SYDTF, SYDVs, SHCEK and the DIE.

* Conditional Cash Transfers - CCT ( US$ 360.00 million, of which Bank US$ 260.0
million): The SRMP would finance the introduction through the SYDTF/SYDVs of
an expanded social safety-net targeted to the poorest 6 percent of families linked to
certain positive behavioral changes such as keeping children in school and ensuring
children receive adequate immunization coverage in a timely manner, basic health care
and nutrition (including resolving micro-nutrient deficiencies). This would require the
introduction of an improved and systematic targeting system using "points" for
household characteristics linked to poverty. The loan would finance education grants
(paid twice in a school term or four times during the 9 month academic year) and
health/nutrition grants (paid quarterly) to the mothers (or other eligible recipients) of
children who are eligible in accordance with criteria set forth in the Project Operations
Manual (POM). Government presentation to the Bank of a POM, satisfactory to
the Bank has been completed. All subsequent changes to the POM must be agreed
with the Bank, and all procedures and conditions set forth in the POM must be
followed during project implementation. The CCT is a highly targeted social
assistance transfer to families with children, requiring positive family behavioral
change with respect to health and education.
=  Local Initiatives (US$ 133.85 million, of which Bank US$ 104.53 million): The
SRMP would strengthen and finance key programs of the SYDTF/SYDVs as
proposed by provinces, districts, and local community demand, designed to provide
enhanced sustainable employment opportunities for the poor, thereby reducing
poverty. Such programs are: (i) income-generating sub-projects (which will receive
improved technical assessment and M&E under the SRMP); (ii) employability training
(including adult literacy - especially for women-through mass media such as TV, local
radio and local newspapers), technical and life skills training for unemployed youth -
including how to get a job, start a small business); (iii) temporary community
employment which will support workfare activities linked to the rehabilitation of local
infrastructure and community assets; and (iv) expansion of cost-effective social
services for children, youth, disabled and the elderly (including through SHCEK and
NGOs).

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
A number of key policy reforms are being sought:
(i) Establishment of an affordable safety-net which reinforces positive health and
education behaviors.
CCT are transfers which are conditioned on recipient behavior for continued receipt. The
behaviors required are school attendance for school-age children and well baby/health clinic visits
for children below school age. The idea behind CCT is that the poor are often forced to pull their
children out of school to work or look after younger siblings when the household is faced with an
economic crisis. This is clearly a looming danger for Turkey, based on the team's findings from
fieldwork and the Social Assessment. Withdrawing children from school often leads to a
permanent reduction in the human capital of the children who do not typically return to school
after the crisis, and a perpetuation of the cycle of poverty across generations.
CCT will provide an incentive to the poor to: (i) keep their children in school and work on
the demand side of education by covering the out-of-pocket expenses (school books, uniforms,
stationary and textbooks) that often preclude the poor from sending their children to school; and
(ii) obtain adequate pre-natal care, basic health and nutrition services (including immunization,
growth monitoring and resolving micro-nutrient deficiencies). CCT will be targeted to the poor
by proxy means tests. In Turkey, a large informal sector means that income-testing would be too
expensive and difficult, so a scoring formula based on a proxy means test will be used.
- 25 -



CCT are an important mechanism to protecting and developing the human capital of the
vulnerable. CCT are an important tool in the battle against the inter-generational transfer of
poverty, since children who fail to complete basic education today become the poor of tomorrow.
The CCT would need to be carefully monitored and evaluated to determine whether it is achieving
its objectives and determine the duration of the program. A full review of the CCT would be
undertaken with the Bank on December 31, 2003, as part of the mid-term review of the
SRMP, and follow-up actions agreed with the Bank. The operation of the CCT will also be
reviewed as part of the Annual Program review discussed below.
The level of the benefits for the Rapid Response component will be deternined by the
SYDTF and SYDVs, based on their standard parameters for this type of in-kind social assistance
already in place. For the CCT component, there is a difference between the benefit for education
and that for health. Health benefits will be US $6 per child, paid quarterly, for a total of US$ 72
per year. For education, a sliding scale will be used for each subsequent child, beginning at US $8
per child and decreasing monotonically with each subsequent child. Education benefits will be
paid twice per term or 4 times during the 9 month academic year, totalling US$ 72 per child for
the first child in each family. These amounts are comparable to the benefits paid in CCT
programs in Latin America, and also corresponds to a significant share (but less than 100 percent)
of out-of-pocket expenditures.
(ii) Improved targeting of social assistance to increase efficiency of public resources
use.
Virtually all of the SYDV in Turkey identify the needy and select them for assistance by
the deliberations of a local committee, which is headed by the Kaymakam at the District level and
by the Governor or Vice-Governor at the Provincial level. While local officials may have access
to local knowledge about the applicants, they lack training in social work and social assessment,
and their decisions are vulnerable to accusations of favoritism, even if none occurred.
Many countries have found the use of a scoring formula to lead to outcomes that are more
equitable and efficient than the decisions of local committees. Turkey has experience with scoring
formulas--in Van province, the SYDV uses a scoring formula developed by the local SHCEK
Directors, and the SYDTF uses a scoring formula for the allocation of scholarships. Turkey will
use reliable household data from a socio-econo.nic survey to develop a national scoring formula.
A major advantage of a scoring formula is that it can be used to rank households according to
their level of poverty, and different social assistance programs can use different cut-off points for
eligibility. This would make it possible to target CCT and other food and social assistance to the
most needy, while targeting other programs such as income generation and training to those
vulnerable, but not as destitute. In this way, scarce public sector resources for social assistance
will make the maximum impact on poverty reduction.
- 26 -



(iii) Strengthening the institutional framework for social risk mitigation,
management and prevention.
The existing SYDTF, SYDVs, and SHCEK will be strengthened under the SRMP to
perform their increased and modemized role to strengthen the social safety-net linked to the
development of the market economy--including enhanced technical staff skills, improved financial
management & auditing, MIS, M&E and linkages with civic society. This is predicated upon an
improved organizational framework law for the SYDTF and SYDVs. The Government has
submitted to Parliament legislation, satisfactory to the Bank, strengthening the SYDTF and
SYDV structures to perform their long-term social risk mitigation, management and
prevention role and enabling them to work with and contract NGOs more easily. Enactment
of this law is a condition of disbursement for the CCT and Local Initiatives components. The
institutional strengthening of the SYDTF and SYDVs will include the implementation of the key
agreed recommendations of the operational review undertaken by consultants in the context of the
Emergency Earthquake Recovery Loan (EERL), inter alia, requiring formal financial reporting
arrangements of the SYDVs to the STDTF, and the development and implementation of an
integrated MIS. The SRMP will finance the high priority investment needs of these institutions
through the Institutional Development component. The Government and the Bank will review
annually, by November 30 each year, commencing 2001, progress in social protection policy
and reforms and the adequacy of the budgetary allocations for such purposes (Annual
Program), making recommendations to further enhance the SRMP program to strengthen
social risk mitigation, management and prevention, based upon a report to be received by the
Bank from the Government by October 30 each year during project implementation.
Following such review, the Government will formally adopt the agreed Annual Program by
January 31.
(iv) Promotion of employability of the poor.
It would be both inappropriate and unaffordable to rely on a passive social assistance
system. The CCT system must be supplemented by an active program aimed at helping to
improve the employability of the poor (basic skills related to market demands, literacy, numeracy,
interviewing and job-search skills, coping-with-life-skills). The very limited temporary community
employment activities undertaken by the SYDVs will be expanded to provide an employment
safety-net to the able-bodied poor in areas where this can be organized. Additional support for
starting small-businesses and other income generating activities for the poor will be provided.
Local temporary community employment programs will be supported. All these activities need to
be relevant to the market demands and of high technical quality and thus the Government will
work ever more closely with the private sector, especially chambers of commerce and industry
and NGOs at the local level. These activities will be supported under the Local Initiatives
component of the SRMP.
- 27 -



(v) Adequate poverty monitoring and dissemination as the basis for policy
establishment.
Poverty policy design, M&E, has been handicapped by the lack of an adequate HIES (the
last having been undertaken in 1994, and that for 2001 having been cancelled in light of prevailed
macro economic circumstances and technical reasons). The Government will field two
household surveys during the SRMP, financed by the SRMP and the Government.
Turkey adopted the European Union Acquis in a legal declaration signed by the Council
of Ministers and the President of Turkey on March 19, 2001. The Official Gazette published
(March 24, 2001) the 500-page National Program for the Adoption of the Acquis, of which 49
pages pertain to the Acquis on statistical information.  The Government confirmed that this
Presidential action has the force of law in Turkey and establishes a clear and unequivocal basis for
future actions for statistics.  The EU Acquis on statistics provides for open data access. The
Governiment affirms that this Presidential Action is sufficient to establish the principles of open
data access in Turkey and thus has satisfied the Bank requirements under the SRMP. Support for
the continued quantitative monitoring and evaluation of poverty in Turkey through regular rapid
surveys will be provided through the Institutional Development component of the SRMP.
(vi) Civic society involvement and empowerment of the poor.
Increasingly, governments are realizing that the most effective approach to social policy
and economic reform is to build partnerships with civic society, including key stakeholders such as
NGOs, community-based organizations (CBOs), trade unions, and local officials. These actions
will over time give a stronger voice to the poor and thereby empower them more. There was an
outpouring of support for earthquake victims from NGOs, CBOs, civil society, and even private
individuals. NGOs are active in providing social assistance to the needy, and in child welfare
activities but often in a sporadic uncoordinated manner with the responsible state agency. The
Ciovernment is in the process of adopting draft legislation, which will then be submitted to
Parliament, to enable the SYDTF and SYDVs to work more effectively among themselves and
with the Government, and will encourage NGOs in their endeavors to grow and become more
professional. The Government has submitted to Parliament draft legislation, satisfactory to
the Bank, enabling the SYDTF and SYD V structures to work with and contract NGOs more
easily. Enactment of this law is a condition of disbursement for the CCT and Local Initiatives
components. Civic society will be actively involved in the Local Initiatives component of the
SRMP as service providers; as members cf the Executive Committee; and civic society
representatives will sit on the SRMP Advisory Committee.

3. Benefits and target population:
The SRMP has several different target groups for the differing components of the
operation. For the adjustment portion, the target group consists of the poorest of the poor who
have already been identified by local community committees of the SDYTV, following the logic
that the poorest of the poor are the most vulnerable to the effects of crisis. A second target group
are children in those households with expenditures under the absolute food poverty line--some six
to eight percent of the population. The CCT component will be focussed on this group and the
beneficiaries will be identified by a proxy-means test scoring formula developed from household
data. The third target group is the economically vulnerable--according to the Living Standards
Assessment, the consumption of approximately 36 percent of the Turkish population is low
enough such that this population is at significant risk to slide into absolute poverty. This group is
the target group for the Local Initiatives component, since the income-generating activities are
not suitable for the poorest of the poor (who may not have the basic skills to develop small
income-generating activities), but are highly relevant to those employed casually in the informal
sector, for enhancing their income-generating potential.
Groups will be identified by different mechanisms. In the case of the target group for the
adjustmnent portion, the targeting mechanism will be the existing SYDV local committees which
decide eligibility on a case-by-case basis. For the CCT and Local Initiatives components, the
target group will be identified by using the proxy-means test scoring formula, but the eligibility
cut-offs will be different for the different groups. More stringent criteria (a lower score) will be
used to differentiate the absolute poor (for the CCT component), while the economically
vulnerable will qualify under criteria which are still related to poverty, but not as stringent as the
absolute poor (for the Local Initiatives component).
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The SRMP would be managed by the SYDTF, which has created a small PCU with
satisfactory staff to perform the following functions: project management, procurement, financial
management & disbursement, MIS, monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Participating Agency
Agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, have been signed by the SYDTF, SHCEK and DIE
prior to Board outlining the commitments of all parties to implement the SRMP effectively.
For the adjustment portion, an Implementation Agreement between the Treasury and MB
has been signed. In the case of the SYDVs, their participation in the SRMP are governed
on the basis of circulars (accepted as satisfactory to the Bank) issued by the SYDTF which
are legally binding and obligate the SYDVs to implement the SRMP in accordance with the
POM and the Loan Agreement.
Advisory Committee: The Advisory Committee, chaired by the Minister of State
responsible for the SYDTF will include members who are representatives from the Participating
Agencies and related institutions, and civic society. The committee will be responsible for
providing the SYDTF guidance and recommendations regularly. The Advisory Committee shall be
responsible for periodically assessing the overall Project implementation and problems, based on
information provided by the PCU and other sources, and shall provide the SYDTF written
recommendations and advice regarding future Project activities.
- 29 -



The Executive Committee for the Local Initiatives project would be comprised of the
Project Coordinator for the SRMP, the Secretary General of the SYDTF, the M&E specialists, a
member of SHCEK, and members of at least three national NGOs. The Executive Committee
shall be responsible for evaluating proposals for Sub-projects and Performance Grants, and
making recommendations to the SYDTF, and for reviewing and reporting to the SYDTF the
status of Sub-projects and Performance Grants under implementation.
The PCU, physically located within the SYDTF, will be in charge of project management,
administration and concrete implementation, functioning as service-provider to the various
implementing agencies. The PCU will work as a specialized organizational unit of the SYDTF,
staffed with staff from the Fund (counterpart members) and local consultants for the activities
where the SYDTF lacks, at present, experience: both fiduciary (disbursement, procurement,
project accounting and reporting) and pertinent to SYDTF's core functions (for instance
targeting, M&E and public information). The SYDTF will furnish through the PCU!: (i)
Quarterly PMRs commencing on January 31, 2002; and (ii) will hold a mid-term project
review with Bank by December 31, 2003, based upon a report received by November 30, 2003
The implementation of the SRMP will be in accordance with the POM which is currently
being finalized. The POM hass been approved by the Government and submitted to the Bank
The POM can be modified only in agreement with the Bank
The PCU team will involve representatives from the SHCEK and the DIE (to ease
communication and facilitate coordination between the SYDTF and the two agencies) and will
comprise a procurement person, an accountant, a disbursement person, an information technology
expert, a monitoring and evaluation expert, a reporting and communication expert, and two
support staff. All PCU team members have already been appointed with TORs and CVs
acceptable to the Bank. Job descriptions for the local consultants (Procurement Specialist, FMS
Specialist, MIS Specialist, IT Advisor, and Communication Specialist), to be hired for the life of
the project and who will be preferably experienced in Bank-financed projects, were reviewed and
approved by the Bank. These consultants would be hired within the next two months. It is
expected that the SYDTF will improve its capacity by the support of these qualified professional
individual consultants and that a financial management system satisfactory to the Bank will be
maintained and strengthened by the Fund throughout project implementation.
All fiduciary functions (disbursement, procurement, accounting and reporting) will be
centralized at the PCU level. To that extent, the PCU must be provided appropriate resources
and appropriate training in project management and administration for the PCU members. The
S YDTF has managed efficiently and effectively the emergency response to the August 1999
earthquake, proving itself as the most suitable vehicle to administer assistance transfers in a fast
and sufficiently controlled way. However, it has not performed project management and
administration functions for which, at present, there is no capacity in place. The SYDTF written
policies and procedures will be reinforced through the circulars, satisfactory to the Bank, which
will govem SRMP implementation.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Various lending instruments were considered to support the Government program and
objectives before the hybrid option was finally adopted
*  SIL: Although a SIL would provide the necessary investment resources, it would not
be able to respond to the crisis needs in a timely manner.
*  TA Loan: TA needs only form a small part of the overall financing requirements and
thus such an approach was not found to be relevant.
*  Adjustment Loan: An adjustment loan would be appropriate for both the quick
response and legal framework improvement requirements.  However, such an
approach would not address the key institution-building and investment requirements
of the SRMP. Having separate adjustment and investment loans would be an option,
but the risk of the two elements losing coherence was considered high. An integrated
approach of a combined adjustment component as a rapid response to the crisis
combined with the longer-term institution-building and investment components was
thus adopted. A hybrid loan was chosen, despite the increased complexity in loan
processing.
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed,
ongoing and planned).

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The SRMP draws extensively upon the experience obtained through the implementation of
the Bank's Turkish portfolio (Turkey). The design has been based upon the lessons learnt and
experience gained from and other projects in Turkey, as well as social protection projects more
widely (global). It is totally consistent with the ECA and Bank-wide Social Protection Strategy
(strategy). The main lessons leamt (with source in parentheses) incorporated into the SRMP are
summarized below:
- 32 -



*  Comprehensive social mitigation approach: There are great synergies to be obtained by
linking social protection with the health and education sectors as part of an overall social
mitigation strategy (strategy). The SRMP explicitly links social assistance provision with
health and education under the CCT, thereby developing important synergies and
strengthening demand for basic health and education services by the poor.
*  Policy implementation is as important as design: Even the best policy design can be
undone by poor implementation (Turkey, global). The SRMP combines TA for policy design,
together with the strengthening of M&E and resources for program implementation in a
coherent and integrated manner.
*  Strong national ownership: Projects will only be implemented effectively if there is strong
national ownership (Turkey, global). The project components build exactly on the strengths
of the SYDTF, SYDVs, SHCEK and DIE, and have their strongest endorsement. Provincial
and District administrations and NGOs are also highly supportive.
*  Involve stakeholders: Stakeholders views and inputs must be incorporated constantly into
the project design if it is to respond to the real needs of the proposed beneficiaries (global,
Turkey). The project includes a number of beneficiary assessment to monitor stakeholders
interests and perceptions. Communities will be able to make sub-project proposals under the
Local Initiatives component. All stakeholders are represented on the SRMP Advisory
Committee.
*  Centrality of M&E: M&E of social protection programs and projects has been inadequate
(global, strategy) in many lending operations within social protection globally and in Turkey.
Institutionalizing M&E across the entire range of the activities of the SYDTF, SYDVs and
SHCEK is central to, and one of the areas of real value-added, of the SRMP for Turkey.
*  Coordinated informatics: Informatics systems must be able to communicate with one
another with a user-friendly interface and should only be introduced after existing manual
informations systems and processes have been streamlined (global, Turkey). Special attention
is being given to ensure that the informatics systems of the SYDTF, SYDVs and SHCEK will
all inter-connect effectively, and will have a user-friendly interface.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The borrower has a very high level of ownership of the SRMP as evidenced by: (i)
undertakings made in the LSP, including strengthening the legislative basis for the SYDTF; (ii)
increased allocation of budgetary funds for 2001 to the SYDTF to mitigate the impact of the
February 2001 crisis on the poor (including the already completed transfer of TL 40 trillion to the
SYDTF for the purchase of back-to-school packs for the poorest 1.05 million children; (iii)
establishment of the PCU for the SRMP including staffing, office space, furniture and equipment;
(iv) high level of counterpart funding agreed; and (v) willingness to engage all stakeholders in
project governance through the SRMP Advisory Committee. The LSP commits the Government
to working towards the passage of key pieces of legislation to strengthen Turkey's social
safety-net.
- 33 -



5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The February 2001 crisis has made the Government more aware both of the need to
mitigate the immediate negative impacts on the poor, and also to address long-term issues of
poverty and social exclusion. The Bank is able to contribute to both of these needs in a major
way. In terms of the rapid response to the crisis, the Bank is able to provide additional financial
resources and guidance on the key programs which would help mitigate the negative impacts of
the crisis on the poor (support to poor families in basic education, health, heating and food
consumption as well as strengthening the legal framework for the social safety-net). Over the
longer-term, the Bank is: (i) providing guidance on improvements in government structures to
help the poor (SYDTF, SYDVs, SHCEK and DIE) including a stronger voice for the poor
themselves; (ii) building up the institutional capacity of these same institutions, including the
introduction of regular HIES to monitor poverty; (iii) supporting the introduction of an
affordable, highly targeted social safety-net (the CCT) which will lead to improved health and
education outcomes for the poor, through both policy advice and finance; and (iv) improving the
quality of income generating and employability training activities under the Local Initiatives
component by bringing in best practice from social funds globally, improving procedures and
criteria, including the essential elements of the Government's economic reform program. The
Most recent poverty profile in Turkey is presented.  A  summary of the employment,
unemployment and under-employment is provided. and increasing their financial resources
available for such sub-projects thereby increasing their impact on the poor.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
(D Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
O Cost effectiveness
E Other (specify)
Annex 4 presents detailed analysis of: (i) the poverty profile in Turkey; and (iii) recent
trends in employment, unemployment and under-employment. An assessment of the allocation
formula for the distribution of funds from the SYDTF to the 931 SYDVs was undertaken. The
formula is appropriate, fair, simple and transparent as it distributes funds based on population
weighted by a poverty index developed by the DIE with a further uplift factor of 50 percent for
the Eastern and South-Eastern Anatolian regions.
2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)
The key financial issues being addressed are: (i) the sustainable revenue base for the
SYDTF, including the need to avoid the accumulation of arrears in the transfer of revenues from
the Treasury and maintaining a stable withholding rate by the Treasury on the earmarked
revenues; and (ii) the FMS for the SYDTF and SYDV to ensure an open, transparent and
accountable management of funds.  The first issue is being addressed through the LSP (see
Annex 11) with commitments from the Treasury to ensure domestic financing to the SYDTF of
TL 550 trillion in 2001.  The second issue is being addressed through the Institutional
- 34 -



Development component which includes developing the FMS and computerized MIS for the
SYDTF, SYDVs and SHCEK. A cash-flow statement of the SYDTF for 1999-2001 is included
in Annex 5. The SYDTF has managed to balance expenditures and revenues fairly closely in
recent years.
Fiscal Impact:
The fiscal impact of the Turkish Government's counterpart contributions to the SRMP is
minimal. For the US$ 100 million adjustment portion, there is no net fiscal impact since the Bank
is financing this component at 100 percent. For the CCT, while counterpart funding is expected
to be forthcoming from the Turkish Government, the amount of net increase in fiscal expenditures
is quite low--only US$ 100 million over the life of the project, or less than 0.12 percent of GDP.
Overall, the total net increment to Turkish fiscal expenditure over the first 3 years of the project
only amounts to less than 0.15 percent of GDP. If the Government decides to continue the CCT
at the level proposed under the SRMP, this would amount to public expenditures of some 0.17
percent of GDP annually from 2005 onwards, but could be increased or reduced according to the
priority given to the CCT.
3. Technical:
A number of key technical issues are being addressed:
  Policy development, M&E - through TA and training under the Institutional
Development component.
*  Staff skills - through in-service training under the Institutional Development
component.
*  Public information - through the design and implementation of improved public
information campaigns using appropriate messages, media and languages for the
targeted population groups under the Institutional Development component.
*  CCT - through the creation of a highly targeted social safety-net leading to improved
human capital behavior by the targeted population groups (i.e. the extreme poor)
under the CCT component.
* Income generating sub-projects for the poor - through TA leading to improved
evaluation, supervision and technical inputs under the Local Initiatives component.
* Employability training for the poor - through improved design and implementation,
making the training more relevant for the needs of the market economy with the
enhanced involvement of the private sector and NGOs under the Local Initiatives
component.
* Temporary community employment - expending the capacity of SYDVs to manage
such programs in a measured and effective manner.
4. Institutional:
The SRMP requires the active participation of a variety of central govermment agencies
(SYDTF, SHCEK, DIE, MEB, and SB) together with the 931 SYDVs and the respective district
administrations headed by the Kaymakam. NGOs and the private sector will play an increasingly
important role in the Local Initiatives component. They will participate as members of the
- 35 -



Advisory Committee of the SRMP and as members of the Executive Committee of the Local
Initiatives Component. This would ensure the effective implementation of the SRMP, through
meaningful representation of all key stakeholders and participants. Detailed institutional analysis
of the key agencies (SYDTF, the SYDVs and SHCEK) is provided in Annex 13.
The SYDTF is an extra-budgetary fund established by Law No. 3294 dated May 29, 1986.
The SYDTF is administered by a Committee comprising Under-secretary of the Prime Ministry,
Under-secretary of Ministry of Interior, Undersecretary of SB, the General Directorate of
Foundations and the General Director of the SHCEK, under the chairmanship of a State Minister
appointed by the Prime Minister. All of the decisions made at the Committee meetings enter into
effect after approval and ratification by the Prime Minister. The SYDTF does not have its own
administrative capacity and most of its staff members are seconded and paid from ministries or
other agencies. This is being changed
4.1 Executing agencies:
The SYDTF is responsible for the overall implementation of the SRMP and has
established an adequately locally staffed PCU. The SYDTF will transfer funds to the 931
SYDVs, which will manage and disburse funds under the adjustment portion, CCT and Local
Initiatives components, under the guidance and direct supervision of the SYDTF. The SYDTF,
DIE and SHCEK will each implement their respective sub-components of the Institutional
Development component, with technical support from the PCU.
The SYDVs are legal entities established at the provincial/sub-provincial level, managed
by their own local Committee, enjoying some delegated decision-making in carrying out their
activities. For effective coordination and monitoring by the SYDTF on the activities carried out
by the SYDVs under the umbrella of the SRMP, the SYDTF will send the SYDVs circulars
(satisfactory to the Bank), spelling out respective roles and responsibilities and empowering the
SYDTF with authority to implement specific actions in case of less than satisfactory participation
or performance by the SYDVs. The introduction of standardized procedures and reporting
formats will be needed, which will be one of the outcomes of the establishment of a common,
unified financial and management information system (financed under the Institutional
I)evelopment component of the project). What proved to be an extremely successful response
and spontaneous mobilization under the earthquake emergency needs, under the SRMP will be
systematized and documented, in order to become an efficient, sustainable and transparent social
safety-net and an effective system of social services and assistance.
Given the accelerated project preparation, it is estimated that it would take until the latter
part of 2001 to establish a satisfactory FMS, adequate to support project implementation, will
take (including human resources, software, hardware, policies and procedures). This will be
documented in the Financial Management Manual (which which be incorporated in the POM)
which together with a positive certification by a Bank FMS staff of these arrangements, will
be conditions of disbursement for the CCT and Local Initiatives components.
- 36 -



4.2 Project management:
The PCU will coordinate the SRMP. Office space has already been made available and
equipment and furniture is in the process of being procured (using SYDTF own resources). A
PCU comprising 10 existing staff of the SYDTF (financed as a Government counterpart) will
form the core of the PCU. All these 10 key staff have been appointed with TORs and
qualifications satisfactory to the Bank.  These staff will be complemented by short-term
specialized consultants on procurement, FMS, MIS and M&E financed under the SRMP. In
addition, liaison officers will be appointed by both the DIE and SHCEK to ensure coordination of
their respective sub-components with the SYDTF PCU.
4.3 Procurement issues:
The SYDTF has experience in managing cash payments funded from a Bank loan
(the EERL), but has had no experience in traditional Bank procurement. Training, funded under
the loan, will be provided to the PCU procurement staff, complemented by frequent advice and
support from the Bank's procurement specialists in the Ankara office. The procurement review
has been completed and the agreed procurement upgrading action-plan is included in Annex 6.
4.4 Financial management issues:
The PCU has an accountant who will be assisted through hiring a local consultant
with adequate qualifications. The FMS for the SYDTF will be completely upgraded under the
Institutional Development component to enable clear tracking of funds and improved accounting.
The FMS review has been completed and is summarized in Annex 6.
The SYDTF is subject to government regulations on accounting (Uniform Code of
Accounts) and record-keeping; however, the Fund is not required to produce financial statements,
given its nature of extra-budgetary fund and tax-exemption status. The SYDTF is subject to
annual audits by the Prime Ministry Supreme Audit Board.
The SYDTF's existing accounting unit is not prepared and adequately staffed to cope with
the increased workload originated by the project. The existing FMS is inadequate to support
project accounting/reporting functions (following government accounting classifications and
conventions). It is not supported by the needed intemal controls; hence the need (among other
fiduciary areas, where adequate resources and skills are lacking) for the establishment of a PCU
through which specialized information systems and adequate professional expertise will be made
available to the SYDTF.
Given the lack of financial management capacity at the PCU, establishment of basic
financial management arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank is a Condition of Loan
Effectiveness. Disbursement of each investment component of the loan will be subject to an
FMS certification of the financial management systems for that particular component and an
action plan for the certification has been prepared and included in Annex 6.
The risks in this operation are considered substantial both from the financial control
perspective and reputational risk perspective. Therefore, beside the standard audit requirements to
- 37 -



be applied in respect of both the adjustment and the investment parts of the project, a number of
measures have been agreed to minimize the risks identified in the various activities. These
activities are: (a) documentary reviews in respect of the adjustment portion by a governmental
audit body; (b) pre-audits of payments under CCT carried out by a governmental audit body on
a systematic basis; and (c) an operational review for the whole SRMP carried out at the end of
the first year of implementation by the Treasury Controller,s with the assistance of an
independent, private sector accounting/consulting firm. The further strengthening of a satisfactory
FMS, and its maintenance over the life of the SRMP, will be monitored by the Bank during
supervision and throughout project implementation which will be ensured by the availability of a
FMS staff in the Bank's Ankara Office.
5. Environmental:               Environmnental Category: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.
There are no significant environmental issues. The project is rated as an Fl and therefore,
an Environmental Management Plan is not required for the SRMP. However, the social
assessments will include an area assessment for each community/locality eligible for under the
Local Initiatives component. The assessments would include mapping of the district from a social
and environmental perspective. Each sub-project identified by communities as a priority need will
be evaluated and assessed for its environmental impact by consultants recruited by the PCU for
this purpose. The Ministry of Environment has limited regional capacity to monitor compliance
with regulations and therefore the PCU will need to recruit consultants to be able to carry out this
task. TORs are being developed and included in the POM for this purpose. The approach for the
TORs and for the monitoring will be used against the criteria described in the operations manual
on a case-by-case basis for each sub-project. The SYDVs and the PCU will be responsible for
evaluating each subproject proposal for its viability against several different criteria, including an
environmental viability of the sub-project.  This capacity for identifying and supporting
environmentally sound sub-projects will be strengthened in all of the participating SYDVs and
through training and technical assistance.
The POM details the mechanisms and institutional arrangements for: environmental
screening at the time of grant application, environmental evaluation at the time of sub-project
appraisal, and monitoring compliance during sub-project implementation. The POM defines the
cases in which no environmental review is needed, and those in which either an environmental
review, a limited impact assessment or a full impact assessment (financed by the loan) is needed.
It would also provide guidance on how to prepare an Environmental Management Plan when
mitigation measures are needed, and identify possible monitoring indicators to be used by the
project implementing unit for M&E. However, subprojects financed under the Local Initiatives
component are expected to be very small interventions in infrastructure repair with no harmfuil
affects to the environment.

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
A Social Assessment was undertaken. This included both stakeholders analysis and
beneficiary assessment. The objectives were to: (i) understand the impact of the fiscal crisis on
different social groups, mainly the poor and those vulnerable to poverty as a result of the crisis;
(ii) evaluate the institutions in charge of service delivery to the poor and their programs; and (iii)
provide information on strengthening and improving the services targeted to the poor.
There are a number of key social issues which are specifically of the concem of the social
assessment. They include: (i) gender, (ii) regional disparities, (iii) youth, and (iv) access and
exclusion. The social assessment which includes both beneficiary and stakeholders assessment
explore these social issues in-depth. For example, with respect to gender, the main issues are the
access of young poor girls to education and the barriers to their equal participation; with respect
to regional disparities are the cultural and communication differences which may effect access and
result in exclusion.
6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?
The involvement of key stakeholders at all levels is essential for the success of the SRMP.
The development of a responsive social assistance system, one of the main objectives of the
SRMP, means understanding the diverse needs of the beneficiaries which is central to the
long-term success of the SRMP. To this end, stakeholders at all levels were consulted including:
(i) Government institutions in charge of social service delivery SYDTF, SYDV, SHCEK, DIE,
MEB, and SB; and (ii) NGOs working with the poor; and (iii) members of poor conmmunities
themselves. The views of all these stakeholders were taken into account for the preparation of the
SRMP.
6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?
In order to achieve its objectives, the SRMP requires enhanced participation of civic
society (NGOs, trade unions and the private sector) as well as the involved Government agencies
(Treasury, SYDTF, SHCEK, DIE, SOP, MEB, and SB) to ensure improved relevance and quality
of the activities financed. The Advisory Committee for the SRMP chaired by the Minister
responsible for the SYDTF includes several NGOs. In relation to NGOs and civic society, the
- 39 -



responsible for the SYDTF includes several NGOs. In relation to NGOs and civic society, the
SYDTF is developing a simple accreditation process as encapsulated in the new SYDTF law
enabling the SYDTF and SYDVs to contract NGOs as service providers.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
A program of Beneficiary assessment is included in the SRMP to undertake M&E on the
social development outcomes of the project. The results will be disseminated and discussed in the
Advisory Conmmittee, and corrective actions if required taken.
6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development outcomes?
M&E arrangements will monitor SRMP outcomes on both the institutions involved as well
as the impact it has on the beneficiaries (see Annex 1). To enable a systematic M&E during the
life of the project a number of studies are completed or are underway. A household survey has
been commissioned to understand the poverty level among the beneficiaries of the project in order
to best reach them. In addition, a Social Assessment has been piloted in poor urban areas (
gecekondus in Istanbul) and poor rural areas (Van) using Bank budget funds. This will be
followed by a more comprehensive social assessment covering the country financed under the
SRMP. These two studies will be used as part of the baseline analysis for further M&E.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
This hybrid operation consists of two portions: adjustment portion (Rapid Response)
which is by definition not intended to be sustainable, and the other portion (investment element)
which by definition needs to be sustainable. The investment portion includes three components,
all of which are sustainable in the medium-term: Institutional Development, CCT, and Local
Initiatives.
For the Rapid Response (adjustment portion), the intention is to assist the Government
with its immediate efforts to relieve the effects of the financial crisis on the most
vulnerable--notably families with children, who were found to be the most vulnerable to the
negative impact of the crisis. A special focus of the rapid response component is to assist children
in poor families to partially offset the expenses associated with the return to school in September
2001. Other groups that would be assisted in this component are the poor holding health Green
Cards, other eligible poor people including disabled to purchase pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies, and those worst-affected by the crisis with assistance in kind and in cash. As a crisis
intervention, these activities are by their nature one-off and do not require being sustained over
the medium-term.
Institutional Development by its nature is sustainable, since the goal of it is to create
capacity in Turkish institutions to facilitate reforms of the social safety-net and to become more
efficient and effective in so doing. By investing now in MIS technology, improving policy
establishment, M&E, and setting up a targeting mechanism and scoring formula, the institutional
strengthening efforts will lead to improved efficiency and lower operating costs, thus enhancing
sustainability. One of the objectives of public information campaigns is to solicit more voluntary
financing of SYDTF/SYDV and SHCEK programs from the general public and the business
community.
On the CCT, the Bank will provide the majority of financing of these transfers under the
CCT component of the investment portion of the SRMP for its first three years. However, the
Government will also contribute counterpart funding to these transfers, on an increasing basis,
rising to full payment beyond 2004 if the Govermment decides to continue the CCT. Initially, the
CCT will be tightly targeted to the bottom 8 percent of the population by using a scoring formula,
so overall costs will be contained at around 0.17 percent of GDP. Sustainability of expenditures
on CCT will be greatly facilitated by the use of the scoring formula, which would enable the
Government to contract or expand CCT as economic conditions and budgetary resources permit.
As part of the institutional strengthening component, M&E capacity will be developed in the
SYDTF and other institutions so that a comprehensive evaluation of CCT can be undertaken
during the SRMP. If CCT are as successful in Turkey as they have proved to be in Mexico and
Colombia, it is possible that the Government could continue CCT beyond the life on the SRMP as
an important contributor to the social safety net in Turkey. Owing to the flexible nature of the
targeting mechanism, the Government could rapidly scale the CCT up or down, depending on
need and availability of budgetary resources. In the event that the Government decides not to
sustain CCT beyond the life of the SRMP, the exit strategy would be for the Government to rely
- 41 -



on other SYDTF activities such as workfare/temporary community employment (included under
the Local Initiatives component) or other social assistance in kind, relying on the institutional
strengthening of the SYDTF/SYDVs created under the SRMP.
The Local Initiatives component is an expansion of the existing SYDTF progams,
including income-generating and micro-grant programs, which cover their own costs and so are
sustainable, and over time will contribute to general tax revenues. Other local initiative activities
include investments in human capital, such as literacy, which have an economic pay-off and
positive externalities for Turkey. Stringent criteria are being applied to the community social
services sub-projects to ensure that they are cost-effective and that recurrent cost financing is
available.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Macroeconomic situation: Turkey is experiencing significant volatility in its domestic
markets, with particularly sharp increases in interest (up to 96 percent) rates and a depreciation in
the exchange rate (to TL 1,500,000 per US$) experienced on July 17, 2001. The IMF has
undertaken the ninth program review. However, some correction in these rates has already
occurred and the recent financial review and tranche release by the IMF and the PFPSAL from
the World Bank have prompted some short-term stability. The short term outlook continues to
be extremely uncertain and unsettled. In addition, there is concern that this situation compromises
Turkey's ability to go into the international bond market; domestic debt is increasing sharply at a
rate of some 3 percent of GNP per month right now. The external environment continues to
worsen with non-oil commodity prices declining, debt increasing rapidly. However, it is
precisely, in a crisis such as this is, when the macroeconomic situation is most difficult, that social
protection is most needed and the risk to the poorest warrants mitigating.
Choice of a Hybrid Operation: The Bank has had mixed experience with hybrid
operations. However, the hybrid nature of the SRMP operation is as an important way to link
short-term interventions with a medium-term policy reform, and the current crisis was seen as
opening a window for both immediate response to the crisis and medium-term establishment of
important interventions previously lacking in social protection in Turkey. Given the importance
of mitigating the social risks of the project, the provision of school supplies to poor children
supported under the quick-disbursing component constitutes an important confidence-building
measure for the Government and should be supported by the Bank. The SRMP is innovative, in
that it combines elements both of the safety net (CCT) and the trampoline (Local Initiatives
component).
The SRMP seeks to fill in significant gaps in Turkey's social safety-net, and is part of a
concerted Bank effort on mitigating the social impacts of the crisis, including the PSSP (severance
pay for laid-off workers) and the ARIP (income support to farmers) as well as health, education
and social security operations. The SRMP was envisioned as part of the CAS - update high case
program, with only US$ 100 million in a the adjustment portion (thus a low leakage risk) and US$
400 million in investment activities. If the macroeconomic situation changed sharply so that
Turkey was no longer in the CAS high case, the investment portion would still go forward. The
macroeconomic situation in Turkey would continue to be monitored closely, especially in the
context of the next IMF review in September. In addition, the World Bank would prepare a
contingency plan before the end of September 2001.

Design & Implementation Issues: Implementation of a complex operation such as the
SRMP is difficult and close supervision and monitoring are critical to success and issues of
sustainability. The SRMP faces high risks and adequate fiduciary controls must be put into place
to mitigate them.  Special attention would be given to ensuring adequate Bank resources for
supervision.
Targeting: There are three possible controversial aspects of the targeting design under the
SRMP: (i) reaction of the non-poor; (ii) regional disparities; and (iii) female education.
*  Reaction of the Non-poor:  Since the CCT component of the SRMP will include
payments in cash to poor families who keep their children in school and visit health clinics,
there is the possibility of some backlash among the non-poor. The non-poor may resent
the provision of cash to the poor, and there could be some hostile reactions to the
program. In particular, the fieldwork and forthcoming Social Assessment noted that the
distribution of income in the remote villages tends to be only a few relatively well-off
villagers and very many poor villagers. The few relatively-well off villagers may feel
entitled to the CCT as well under the idea that "here in our village we are all poor."
*  Regional Disparities: Since the SRMP will make a special effort to better target the
poorest, there is the chance that the emerging patterns of beneficiaries under the SRMP
will include large numbers of people from specific regions of the country. This may raise
questions of disproportionate representation of certain regions, as being a majority of
SRMP beneficiaries.
*  Female Education: A major focus of the CCT is towards keeping children in school. In
the Eastern Anatolian and many other rural regions and gecekondus in Turkey, there is a
diversity of cultural/traditional attitudes towards the education of girls. In such families,
there may be a conflict between the CCT incentive towards sending girls to school and the
countervailing traditional attitudes.
Choice of Implementing Agency:  The Bank has prior experience with SYDTF as an
implementing agency under the EERL. Its performance was positively evaluated. SYDTF's
ability to manage financial and procurement aspects and its ability to adequately target,
monitor and evaluate are all issues addressed under the SRMP project design under the
Institutional Development component. In addition, the SYDTF will benefit institutionally
from the new legislation on its reorganization and improved collaboration with NGOs.

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
TURKEY: Social Risk Mitigation Project/Loan
By Component:
Project Component I - US$100.00 million
Adjustment Portion: Rapid Response (Bank loan financing of US$100.0 million):
The aim of the adjustment portion is to bring immediate relief to vulnerable groups
through existing channels, since it is not possible within a short time to prepare new delivery
mechanisms (which will be developed subsequently under the investment component of the loan).
This component would finance Turkey's public and private sector import requirements of the
balance of payments (BOP) against a negative list. The Government will use the TL counterpart
of the loan funds to finance priority actions for immediate relief to vulnerable groups suffering
from the impact of the February 2001 economic crisis.
The TL counterpart spending consists of three SYDTF program expenditures targeted to
the poorest families through existing mechanisms of the SYDTF and its affiliated 931 SYDVs:
* School attendance package (shoes, uniforrns, books, stationery for the poorest 1.05
million children);
*  Pharnaceuticals & medical supplies for poor Green Card holders (eligibility criteria
and further details on the Green Card program in Annex 13) and other eligible poor
people, including the disabled; and
* Local social assistance in cash and kind (including family food and heating support) to
those worst affected by the crisis.
It is critical that an additional budgetary allocation be made for increasing the SYDTF's
budget for 2001 by the US$ 100 million equivalent to cover the cost of the increased spending on
these rapid response measures for school attendance, pharmaceuticals, and local social assistance.
Treasury has already transferred TL 40 trillion to the SYDTF for the procurement of the school
attendance packages for the poorest 1.05 million children to the SYDTF as an advance against the
disbursement of the adjustment portion due to the urgency to procure the packages by early
September for distribution prior to the commencement of the school year on September 11. 2001.
In order to finance adequately the key programs of the SYDTF to the poorest for the rest of the
year 2001, Treasury will ensure that the SYDTF receives sufficient domestic financing to
cover cumulative agreed expenditures of TL 550 trillion (including the counterpart funding
from the adjustment portion of the SRMP) by December 31, 2001. These expenditures would
be tracked through the arrangements outlined in Annex 6 and would be subject to an ex post
operational review.
The projected expenditures of the SYDTF for the second half of 2001 are projected at TL
381 trillion (including an estirnated TL 125 trillion from the adjustment portion of the SRMP).
This is a substantial increase over the first half-year's expenditures of TL 169 trillion expenditure.
Projections of SYDTF expenditures for the last 6 months of 2001, as approved by the Bank, are
shown below by program:

Project Component 2 - US$36.61 million
Investment Portion - Component I: Institutional Development (Bank loan financing of US$
30.48 million):
The institutional development components will build up the capacity of the main institutions
which protect the poor, provide social assistance and services and poverty information in Turkey:
(a) the SYDTF and the affiliated 931 SYDVs; (b) SHCEK; and (c) DIE.
(i) SYDTF/SYDVs. This sub-component will strengthen four main functions of the
SYDTF/SYDVs: (a) MIS & IT; (b) Policy, Research, M&E; (c) Staff Development & Training;
and (d) Public Information.
(a) MIS & IT. The SYDTF and SYDVs are responsible for implementing the US$ 360
million CCT Program (see CCT Component below), which would serve more than a million
poor beneficiaries. The type of transaction to be processed within the program would include:
(i) beneficiary registration and application of the formula-based targeting mechanism; (ii)
tracking of compliance with behavioral conditions, e.g. school attendance, health clinic visits
by the beneficiaries; (iii) compilation of the compliance data, and calculation of the amount of
payment to be made to each household; (iv) issuance of payment authorization; (v) transfer of
- 53 -



funds from SYDTF to SYDVs, and then to the financial institution or entity responsible for
making payments to the beneficiaries; and (v) verification of payments. In addition, financial
records must be organized and presented in accordance with the requirements of the
Government and the Bank's FMS to ensure accountability.
Obviously the CCT's success will depend on, among others, high capacity and high speed
information processing systems. The SYDTF very successfully made and tracked payments to
the SYDV for earthquake benefits financed by the Emergency Earthquake Recovery Loan
(EERL). However, the computational power of SYDTF and SYDVs require further
comprehensive upgrading to handle the CCT program. Currently, approximately 70 percent
of the 931 SYDVs are equipped with at least one PC. About 150 SYDVs are running a
stand-alone database application software called "Datasoft"', which keeps data on beneficiary
profiles and records of benefit provisions.  There is no system to share information
electronically across among the SYDTF and SYDVs.  Beneficiary level information
(beneficiary profile, benefit provision records) are kept at the SYDV level, and not transmitted
to the SYDTF. Communications between SYDTF and SYDV are in the form of physical
documents, rather than electronic communications.  SYDTF currently runs 4 independent
networks for each of: (i) Scholarship Program (Windows 2000 network running a database
application based on Visual FoxPro), (ii) Health Program (software written in COBOL
running on CTOS/OPS), (iii) Project-based Assistance Program (Windows98 Peer-to-Peer
network consisting of 5 PC with no client-server application or special database applications
to the program) and (iv) Social Assistance Program (same configurations as Project-based
Assistance Program).
The SRMP will finance the development of an integrated MIS for both the SYDTF central
office and the SYDVs, including hardware, network infrastructure, software development and
staff training. A study of SYDTF's hardware and infrastructure requirements was recently
completed by a consulting firm. The study does not, however, take into account the CCT
because it was contracted before the Government of Turkey and the Bank started the
discussions about the SRMP. The SRMP will require additional studies, system design,
development, installation and staff training.  In addition, the system  will include a
Bank-compliant financial management system (FMS) and an upgraded module for managing
SYDTF's financing for the activities of the SYDVs according to a well developed formula,
which uses population, inverse of GNP per capita and an uplift factor of 50 percent for
Eastern and South-Eastern Anatolia. Furthermore, the system will be designed to allow
transparent information integration with the systems of other social programs, most
importantly those under SHCEK, in order to reduce duplication of efforts and increase the
impact of social programs as a whole.
(b) Policy, Research, M&E: Currently the SYDTF does not have a policy unit. Research,
M&E functions are also undeveloped. Additional staff with adequate qualifications will be
hired for this purpose, together with some intemal staff re-assignments. This sub-component
will provide the SYDTF with TA, training, a program of studies (including beneficiary
assessments) and office equipment to develop these functions.
- 54 -



The costs of the PCU for the SRMP including project management, procurement, financial
management & disbursement, MIS, and M&E functions are included in this sub-component.
The Bank loan will finance the costs of TA, operational reviews for the SRMP, furniture and
equipment, as well as the incremental operating costs for the PCU.

(c)  Staff Development &  Training. The  SYDTF  does not have an adequate human
resources policy. Currently there are some 67 SYDTF staff, of which and falitare seconded
from other government agencies. The secondment period can be quite long-one staff
member had been seconded for 10 years. There are no written procedures or clear definition
of roles and responsibilities for the SYDTF staff. A comprehensive human resources policy
including salary review, performance appraisal, staff training, and a career development
component will be developed under the SRMP. The SYDTF has drafted a new organizational
law which strengthen the structure, linkages with the SYDVs and facilitatee greater
collaboration with NGOs. There are several areas where the skills mix of the SYDTF and
SYDV could be improved. The SYDTF does not have staff with expertise in agricultural and
income-generating sub-projects, which makes it difficult for the SYDTF to properly evaluate
the proposals of the SYDV for funding of sub-projects in their districts. The SYDTF also
does not have trained social workers to help assess the role that SYDTF plays in the provision
of social assistance. This lack of trained social workers is especially acute in the SYDVs,
which are currently responsible for facilitating the allocation of social assistance to applicants.
Provision is made to hire up to 200 social workers per year on short-term contracts, with
generic contracts and TORs satisfactory to the Bank, to strengthen the SYDVs in project
implementation and management of programs such as the CCT. A training program for
existing SYDV staff is urgently needed to supplement their skills, and additionally, would be
required in any case for the CCT - hence the focus of the SRMP on in-service training in
-55 -



project management, management skills, social work and employment/income generation
issues. The SRMP will finance the costs of trainers, training venues and materials for this
purpose.
(d) Public Information. Public information activities are highly undeveloped within the
SYDTF. The SRMP will finance public opinion research as the basis for designing sound well
targeted public information campaigns to various client groups and stakeholders. Public
information campaign costs will be financed by both the Bank and the Government (from
SYDTF own resources) with implementation over 4 years, with a special focus on the CCT
and Local Initiatives.
(ii) SHCEK. This sub-component will stregthen four main functions of SHCEK: (a) MIS
& IT; (b) Policy, Research, M&E; (c) Staff Development & Training; and (d) Public Information.
(a) MIS & IT. Only four years ago, SHCEK was equipped with only one 486 PC. Today, a
major IT improvement project is underway in SHCEK funded from the Government budget
amounting to US$ 1.8 million which provides for the development of the MIS software,
electrical cabling and computers for the SHCEK central and provincial offices. SHCEK also
recently launched a WEB site (http://www.shcek.gov.tr), and installed a powerful
Oracle-based database management system running on UNIX-based workstations in its
headquarter office in Ankara. The IT/MIS department is staffed with 8 professionals.
The SRMP will finance the extension of this system to the 516 service delivery centers of
SHCEK including community centers, child-care institutions and homes for the elderly,
shelters for abused women and rehabilitation centers for the disabled. This will facilitate the
development of a completely integrated MIS by providing Local Area Networked-PCs for
administrative purposes, and beneficiary use as well as Internet connection. In addition, the
system will be designed to interface seamlessly with the systems of the SYDTF and SYDVs,
as well as other social programs.
(b) Policy, Research, M&E: The research, policy-making M&E functions of SHCEK will be
strengthened under the SRMP. Additional staff with adequate qualifications will be hired for
this purpose (funded by SHCEK). This sub-component will provide TA, training, a program
of studies (including beneficiary assessments) and office equipment to develop these functions.
(c) Staff Development & Training. Skills of SHCEK staff will be upgraded through a
program of in-service training on mangement, communication, social work, language skills,
targeting and other key issues. The SRMP will finance the costs of trainers, training venues
and materials for this    purpose.
(d) Public Information. Public information activities are highly undeveloped within SHCEK.
The SRMP will finance public opinion research as the basis for designing sound well targeted
public information campaigns to various client groups and stakeholders. Public information
campaign costs will be financed by both the Bank and the Government and implemented over
the 4 year period of the SRMP, targeted to various audiences including: (i) beneficiaries (to
- 56 -



make them more aware of their rights and responsibilities); (ii) the general public to make
them more aware of services available; and (iii) the international community, to make them
aware of Turkey's progress in these fields.
(iii) DIE. Previously, Turkey did not have a program of regular household surveys
capable of providing the basis for poverty monitoring, evaluation and policy-making. However,
Turkey has adopted the EU Acquis on Statistics in March 2001 that stipulates such a program and
also has convened an Advisory Council to work out the necessary methodology.  This
sub-component will finance the TA necessary to develop a program of household surveys in
Turkey, including the training of DIE staff in the new methodology, while the recurrent cost of
the two household surveys during the SRMP project perioed would be covered primarily by the
DIE budget with co-financing from the Bank. The Bank will finance non-salary requirements,
such as the printing, incremental field survey and transportation costs and the hiring of temporary
local consultants to conduct the interviews as well as incremental IT needs for at least two
household surveys. Under this component, the Bank would also finance the expertise needed on
the IT level for DIE to package its statistical data for distribution, and for enhancing the DIE
website so that users could download other DIE data directly, as well as dissemination through
printed materials. Finally, this component includes financing for incremental IT and technical
assistance needs for the DIE to analyze the 2000 population Census. The Census analysis is
important, because it will enable DIE to combine Census data with household data (with technical
assistance from the Bank) to produce a poverty map for Turkey.
Project Component 3 - US$ 360.00 million
Investment Portion - Component II: CCT (Bank loan financing of US$ 260.00 million):
CCT are transfers which are conditioned on recipient behavior for continued receipt. The
behaviors required are school attendance for school-age children and well baby/health clinic visits
for children below school age. The idea behind CCT is that the poor are often forced to pull their
children out of school to work or look after younger siblings when the household is faced with an
economic crisis. Withdrawing children from school often leads to a permanent reduction in the
human capital of the children who do not typically return to school after the crisis, and a
perpetuation of the cycle of poverty across generations.
CCT are an important mechanism to protecting and developing the human capital of the
vulnerable. CCT are an important tool in the battle against the inter-generational transfer of
poverty, since children who fail to complete basic education today become the poor of tomorrow.
Given that families with children are found to be at high risk for increased poverty and
vulnerability from the February financial crisis, CCT are a recommended policy intervention. CCT
are transfers which are conditioned on client behavior for continued receipt. The behaviors
usually required are school attendance for school-age children and well baby/health clinic visits for
children below school age. The idea behind CCT is that the poor are often forced to pull their
children out of school to work or look after younger siblings when the household is faced with an
economic crisis. This often leads to a permanent reduction in the human capital of the children
who do not typically return to school after the crisis, and a perpetuation of the cycle of poverty
across generations. The loan will finance education and health/nutrition grants to the mothers of
children who are eligible in accordance with criteria set forth in the POM. The Bank will finance
- 57 -



these grants on a declining basis through the end of 2004, whereupon the Government will take
over the full financing responsibility for CCT if it decides to continue the program. This decision
of the Government's will be informed by the results of a comprehensive review of CCT to be
conducted by end-2003 and a formal impact evaluation (also financed under this component).
CCT provide an incentive to the poor to: (i) keep their children in school and work on the
demand side of education by covering the out-of-pocket expenses (school books, uniforms, fees)
that often preclude the poor from sending their children to school; and (ii) obtain adequate
pre-natal care, basic health and nutrition services (including immunization, growth monitoring and
resolving micro-nutrient deficiencies). CCT are typically targeted to the poor by proxy means
tests or income tests. In Turkey, a large informal sector means that income-testing would be too
expensive and difficult, so a scoring formula based on a proxy means test is recommended. CCT
are an important mechanism to protecting the human capital of the vulnerable.
Mechanisms to Verify the Compliance with the Behavioral Requirements.
Compliance with behavioral requirements must be monitored, recorded and verified. In Turkey,
school attendance and health clinic visit records are well kept even in the poorest regions,
although computerization of record keeping is limited. Thus, it can be expected that existing
school systems and health care systems can assume the first-hand role to verify the compliance
with the behavioral requirements.
Reducing exclusion. Using a scoring formula would help bring more objectivity in the
criteria used to allocate social assistance and thus reduce the scope for possible discretion and
inclusion of the non-poor. To minimize exclusion of the poorest, the scoring formula will be
combined with policies which:
*  Help the poorest to formulate a demand for assistance. This will be done through (i) public
information campaigns, including local dialects, on the type of programs available, the
eligibility criteria, and the rights of the applicants to appeal, and the benefits of the
behavioral changes (e.g. on promoting immunization etc.); (ii) house visits by females
who speak local dialects; (iii) and adult literacy campaigns to help applicants to feel more
confident in approaching authorities for assistance. In this way both the Institutional
Development and Local Initiatives components will support the CCT through public
information campaigns and adult literacy programs respectively.
*  Bring human safeguards to the scoring formula. This can be done first by allowing the
applicant to have its case reexamined by a local Appeals Conmmittee in case of a
disagreement with the scoring formula. The committee could composed by the current
members of the SYDV Advisory Committee plus a social worker. Second, exclusion
could be minimized by having the same Appeals Committee systematically reviewing those
cases for which the scoring formula does not provide a clear cut-off. For instance, a range
for the scoring will be defined within which each application will be automatically
reexamined.
The System to Uniquely Identify Individuals and Households. Because a CCT
program transfers benefits to a household based on specific attributes and behaviors of the
- 58 -



household members, it is important that households and individuals can be uniquely identified and
cross-referenced. Futher development of implementation mechanisms, including a sound FMS
and MIS, will mean that the CCT will start in mid-2002.
The Government has made key decisions about the CCT:
*  the amount of Government co-financing for the grants over the period 2002-2004--US$
100 million;
* one national benefit rather than regionally differentiated benefits;
* the level of the benefit (which will be up to US$ 8 per child per 9 months of the school
year for the education grant and $6 per child per month for the health/nutrition grants);
*  the scale for the education grant for additional children in the same family;
* the method of payment (through the banking system); and
* the age limits for the grants (children under 6 for health/nutrition grants, children 6 and
above provided that they are enrolled in grades 1-11 for education grants).
Further details on the CCT and the experience in other countries are provided in Annex
12 of this PAD, while operational guidelines are laid out in the POM.
Project Component 4 - US$133.85 million
Investment Portion - Component III: Local Initiatives (Bank loan financing of US$ 104.52
million):
The SRMP will strengthen and finance key programs of the SYDTF/SYDVs as proposed
by Provinces, Districts and local commnunities designed to provide enhanced sustainable
employment opportunities for the poor, thereby reducing poverty. Such programs are: (i)
micro-grants for income-generating sub-projects (requiring improved technical assessment,
M&E); (ii) employability training (including adult literacy - especially for women) and
unemployed youth (technical and life skills - including how to get a job, start a small business);
(iii) temporary community employment; and (iv) expansion of cost-effective community social
services. This component will function in a social fund mode and would involve participation in
implementation of projects and technical assistance by possible service providers, including
NGOs, based on clearly defined terms of references; selection and performance criteria. Detailed
implementation arrangements are spelt out in the POM.
(i) Income-generating sub-projects: The Local Initiatives component will expand the
provision of micro-grants (Performance Grants) for income generating activities to communities,
villages and groups of beneficiaries (currently undertaken by the projects and investments units of
the SYDTF). The Local Initiatives sub-projects would differ from the current SYDTF practices
- 59 -



by introducing clearly set and periodically revised procedures and systems for identification,
appraisal, implementation and M&E of these grants.  In addition, the Local Initiatives would
expand the types of projects eligible for micro grants by emphasizing the selection criteria and
targeting of beneficiaries rather than pushing a set menu of project options as is currently
practiced by the SYDTF.       The SRMP would strengthen the ongoing program  of
income-generating sub-projects through:
*  improved sub-project analysis based on explicit criteria that take into account
economic, technical, financial and social aspects. SYDTF is developing such
criteria, as well as in-house capability to (i) apply them to sub-project proposals;
and (ii) improve implementation of sub-projects, with contracted TA from public
and private institutions.
*  enhanced monitoring capability to ensure that sub-project implementation
proceeds as planned and funds are spent as intended, monitoring and evaluation
would be built into each phase of sub project implementation and disbursements to
subprojects would be made upon receipt of satisfactory monitoring reports; and
*  expanded evaluation capability, to determine the impact of the project on
beneficiaries and to draw lessons that can feed back into the project analysis and
monitoring phases.
*  improved beneficiary targeting: In addition to applying the new scoring formuala
based on the household survey conducted by local consultants drawing on ODTU
expertise, the eligible beneficiaries would be those whose profiles match the
findings of Social Assessment: persons without access to family resources; or to
land or other property and assets; unemployed without social security benefits;
persons who are not employed in the formal sector; female headed households
(falling in any of the these categories); vulnerable children (orphans, street
children, disabled children); and persons do not have access to social assistance
from any government source. Special attention would be paid to designing
appropriate outreach mechanisms for reaching the poor whose cultural norms may
reduce their access to the project.
Sub-project analysis, preparation and monitoning functions will be performed at
Provincial/District levels (SYDV), which will report to the center (SYDTF). The center will
have sub-project approval and general monitoring functions. The sub-projects will be targeted to
the poor using the CCT scoring formula, but raising the eligibility level to cover the poorest 36
percent. Specific beneficiaries would then be selected according to their capacity to be successful
in an income-generation sub-project according to criteria being developed. The range of potential
sub-projects which could be supported by micro-grants under this component is quite large
including food-processing, fruit and flower production, weaving, metal-work, carpentry, small
green-houses, animal husbandry, transport and service development including minor retail
activities. The limit per beneficiary would be US$ 1,000; with beneficiaries encouraged to form
small producer's associations.

(b) Employability Training: The quality and quanitity of employability training including
adult literacy (especially for women) and for unemployed youth (technical and life skills--including
how to get a job, start a small business) will be expanded under the SRMP. The existing
programs of SHCEK and other agencies will be improved by involving the private sector
(including chambers of commerce and industry) and NGOs to enhance quality and relevance.
Proposals for such training programs including clearly spelt-out target groups, beneficiaries, costs
and quality controls (including involvement of the private sector and NGOs where relevant) will
be submitted by SYDVs to the SYDTF.  Average costs per sub-project are not expected to
exceed US$ 10,000 (with many significantly smaller), although a ceiling of US$ 25,000 has been
established. The Loan will finance the cost of trainers, materials, venues and equipment.
(c) Temporary Community Employment: The Local Initiatives component would
include in its menu, those activities which would create short term daily wage employment
through community works such as the cleaning and repair of existing channels for irrigation,
water supply to households, sewerage; garbage collection; cleaning and repair of parks, roads,
street lights; repair of existing sidewalks, and whitewashing/painting of schools, clinics, etc.
These would typically be proposed and executed by SYDVs with a ceiling per sub-project of US$
50,000.
(d) Community services: The SHCEK network of community centers and social
services will be expanded as they serve an important role in facilitating the integration of migrants
from rural areas into the urban environment.  Any expansion of community centers will be
commensurate with the SHCEK's capacity to adequately staff and finance the operations of such
services. A crucial element for support for community centers expansion is that they ensure the
insertion of beneficiaries as productive participants in the economy and deal with the direct needs
of vulnerable groups such as poor children, youth-at-risk, unemployed, and the elderly. Priority
will be given to sub-projects which: (a) generate models which can be replicated elsewhere; (b)
demonstrate more cost-effective ways of delivering social services;  and (c) enhance the
sustainability of service provision. Average costs per sub-project are not expected to exceed
US$50,000, although a ceiling of US$100,000 has been established.

Annex 4
TURKEY: Social Risk Mitigation Project/Loan
Economic Analysis Summary
Introduction: Key background economic information pertinent to the SRMP is
presented in this Annex in the following sections:
I. Poverty, Inequality & Social Assistance in Turkey;
II. Employment, Unemployment & Under-employment; and
III. SYDTF Allocation Formulae.
I.   Poverty, Inequality, and Social Assistance
Absolute poverty is low but economic vulnerability is widespread
Absolute poverty in Turkey is low based on an international standard. Hence,
internationally comparable "One-Dollar-a-Day" purchasing power parity (PPP) at 1985 prices
line, there is an extremely low incidence of poverty. Only 2.5 percent of the population have
monthly consumption below this level (Table 1). This puts Turkey in the range of countries with
small incidence of absolute deprivation.
Absolute poverty based on a country-specific minimum food basket is also low. Although
the minimum food allowances adopted in Turkey are relatively high by international standards,
only 5.7 percent of households and 7.2 percent of the population can be considered poor in an
absolute sense, i.e. have total monthly consumption below the cost of the minimum food basket.
The cost of the minimum food basket in 1994 was about US$ 36 per month per equivalent adult.
However, unlike absolute poverty, economic vulnerability is a widespread problem. A substantial
number of households (31 percent) and an important fraction of the population (36 percent) have
consumption below the economic vulnerability line (equal to the food line plus an allowance for
non-food items) - approximately equivalent to twice the level of the minimum food basket or
about US$ 190 per household per month.

The comparison of the 1987 and 1994 HIES results suggests that during this period there
was a reduction of about 2.3 percentage points in the overall incidence of economic vulnerability
(from 38.5 to 36.2 percent of the population). However, the relatively rapid growth of the
population meant that despite the drop in incidence, there was an actual increase in the number of
economically vulnerable persons, which grew by more than one million. Progress in reducing
absolute povertywas more pronounced and actually lead to a reduction in the total number of the
poor in Turkey. Although the direction of change is unmistakable, it is also important to note that
the magnitude of decline in poverty is not dramatic. Most households that left poverty between
1987 and 1994, would still be categorized as economically vulnerable in 1994. However, since
1994 was a crisis year, the comparison may underestimate the true decrease in poverty that has
occurred since 1987. Unfortunately, the 1994 HIES data are the latest available that document
household expenditures and incomes in detail.
The main factor contributing to the reduction in poverty was the large population shift
between urban and rural areas. As the population in the relatively less poor urban areas has
expanded with migration flows, poverty in rural areas has fallen dramatically and hence total
poverty has also declined. Demographic changes (lowering of fertility rates among the poor) also
contributed to reducing the number of poor in the country as a whole. Almost a quarter of the
overall reduction of poverty was due to these "structural" factors. The other big contributor to
the drop in poverty was the increase in literacy rates among heads of households-by itself, this
accountedfor almost one-half of the measured reduction in economic vulnerability and poverty
between 1987 and 1994.
Income inequality in Turkey is high
Turkey is a country with large and entrenched inequalities. Income differentials across
regions and social groups are wide and persistent. When measured by the Gini coefficient,
inequality in Turkey is close to the levels observed in some highly unequal countries such as Peru
or Russia (Table 2).
Chile (1994)              0.51        Peru (1994)                0.45

A significant share of total inequality in Turkey is explained by differences in endowments,
geography and opportunities faced in the labor market. Two critical variables, education and
- 64 -



employment status, each explain between a fifth and a quarter of all observed inequality.
Rural/urban differences explain more than 10 percent of the total inequality in the country.
Regional factors explain another 11 percent.
Social Assistance
Groups outside the defined benefit social insurance mechanisms in Turkey are served by
several programs, but the total amount of assistance is relatively small. The programs are
uncoordinated or, at best, loosely coordinated. The most important of them are the following:
*  The SYDTF allocates resources to 931 regional affiliate foundations in every district, and
provides assistance to needy people, chosen at the discretion of the foundations. Benefits
in-kind  include  food,  clothing,  heating,  medicine,  and  a  variety  of  small
business/self-employment activities. The share of cash assistance in total SYDTF program has
increased considerably in the late 1990s. Education grants and scholarship programs, and
disaster related social assistance have also gained importance -now the largest program of
social assistance in Turkey.
*  The Old Age and Disability Assistance Scheme is administered by the Pension Fund (ES)
and local authorities. This was established in 1977 under Law 2022, and provides benefits for
those over 65 and those more than 40 percent disabled. From 343,250 beneficiaries in 1977,
it had grown to have 908,619 beneficiaries by September 1998, with 81 percent of them
receiving old age support and the remaining 19 percent being compensated for their
disabilities.
*  Green Card scheme, begun in 1992-for health care to those with monthly income less than
one-third of the minimum wage. Possible beneficiaries include some in the rural population,
employees unregistered with any social security system or the urban unemployed. In 1998,
there were 7.8 million cardholders, has subsequently risen to some 12 million by 2001.
While the SYDTF is the largest supplier of social assistance, most of its support is
provided not as cash transfers but in kind support for health care and fuel consumption needs.
The only consolidated source of information for this is a 1996 study by the DIE, which reported
that only 20.3 percent of support was for periodic payments; 19.6 percent was for educational
assistance; 13.2 percent was for food and clothing; and 12.2 percent was for heating fuel.
Clearly, the best covered of the groups are the elderly and the disabled, while the worse
off are those of working age, and the unemployed. The elderly are covered either under the three
main social insurance schemes, or under the Law 2022, SHCEK and Green Card programs, with
other discretionary assistance also possible from the SYDTF and other foundations. The
unemployed, on the other hand, are not covered by any defined benefit schemes, and have to rely
on being identified and assisted by social workers who administer the discretionary schemes. This
situation is bound to improve once the newly-adopted unemployment insurance scheme becomes
active. However, the new scheme will apply only to workers within the SSK system, and will
thus not reach unemployed workers from the informal or agricultural sectors. The existing
categorization also excludes the "working poor", who are the least eligible for Government
- 65 -



transfers. These failings point to the need to introduce a more systematic, means tested social
assistance program aimed at the poor-independent of age, employment status, or disability
supported under the CCT
Fiscal costs of the social assistance programs. These social assistance schemes, while
providing relatively insignificant assistance to families, do have a budgetary impact, but one that is
much smaller than that of the social insurance system. The SYDTF is the largest program of
social assistance in Turkey, with disbursements of about 0.29 percent of GNP in 2000 - up
sharply from previous years. The Old Age and Disability Assistance program, administered by the
ES and local authorities, had disbursements of 0.06 percent of GNP in 1999, as did the Green
Card scheme. The SHCEK, which is funded by allocations from the State budget and a share of
revenues from municipalities, provincial administrations, etc.,disbursed some 0.05 percent of GNP
in 1999.

There are perceptible overlaps between the coverage of the various social assistance
schemes, thus making the set of social assistance schemes relatively inefficient at achieving its
goals at minimum cost. Since the disbursements are mostly discretionary, there is no centralized
coordination among the schemes, as a result of which some individuals may get disbursements
from all schemes, or from none. As an example, Table 4 examines the eligibility for social
assistance of five selected groups that are not covered by public social insurance. In the table,
"yes" denotes that a member of the group is covered by the corresponding social assistance
scheme, "no" that it is not. "Possible" denotes that it is feasible for a member of the group to
receive support, given the discretionary powers of the operators of the scheme. This, for
example, is particularly the case for the SYDTF, which has no strict regulations to dispense funds,
but depends on the judgement of the kaymakam. The kaymakam's office also determines who
benefits from the Green-Card health care scheme, under fairly loose eligibility criteria. Only
SHCEK has a defined group of beneficiaries (the elderly and poor children), and is staffed by
qualified social workers, who are required to be graduates of the School of Social Services of
Hacettepe University. Moreover, in the absence of a unique personal identifier system, it is
- 66 -



theoretically possible to receive benefits from one of the three public social security systems, and
also get one or more of the social assistance benefits.

Private and local government sources of social assistance are not adequate to fully
compensate for the gaps in the public program. There are additional schemes operated by
municipalities, who provide social assistance services including healthcare, kitchens for the poor,
subsidized bread and basic food, and operate residential centers for the elderly and the children.
Some of these services are also provided by special provincial administrations and village
administrations.

III.   SYDTF Allocation Formulae
The SYDTF uses robust formulae for the allocation of the general and heating social
assistance support to the 931 SYDVs and are heavily redistributive and progressive.
General Social Assistance: For each district the coefficient is the product of: population
(A) multiplied by the inverse of GDP per capita (B) multiplied by a regional coefficient (C).
Where:
(A) is the latest population census figure from DIE.
(B) is taken from DIE statistics, inverted and normalized to a factor of 1 (richest
districts) to 10 (poorest districts).
(C) is 1.5 for all Eastern and South-Eastern Anatolian districts and 1.0 for the rest of
the country.
The value of the products ABC is added up for the entire country and a coefficient to 8
decimal places obtained. Actual transfers to a particular SYDV are subject to a minimum of TL
1.5 billion per month.
Heating Support: A very similar formula is used for heating support except that the
regional coefficient is replaced by a heating coefficient determined by the Meteorological Office
(with higher values for colder regions). Heating support, of course is only provided in the Winter
season.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
TURKEY: Social Risk Mitigation Project/Loan
Procurement
General:   Bank-financed Goods contracts under the project will be procured in
accordance with the World Bank Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,
published January 1995, and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999 (henceforth referred to as Procurement Guidelines), Bank-financed contracts for
Consulting Services required for the Project will be awarded following the World Bank
Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated
January 1997, revised in September 1997 and January 1999 (henceforth referred to as
Consultant Guidelines). Project activities and procurement contracts not financed by the Bank
will be procured in accordance with the national regulations of the borrower and/or the
procurement regulations of the co-financing institutions. The project inputs, estimated costs and
procurement methods are summarized in Table A. The Procurement Plan is shown in Table Al.
Other procurement information, including prior review thresholds for Bank-financed procurement
contracts, and a summary assessment of the procurement capacity of the coordinating and
implementing agencies and the Bank's review processes are presented in Tables B 1 and B2. For
procurement under the Loan, the Borrower would use the Bank's latest Standard Bidding
Documents (SBD), Standard Form of Consulting Contracts and Requests for Proposals (RFP),
and Standard Bid Evaluation Report Forms.
Notification of Business Opportunities: A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be
published in the Development Business announcing works, goods and consultant services to be
procured, and inviting interested eligible suppliers, contractors and consultants to express interest
and to request any complementary information from the Borrower. The GPN will be updated
annually thereafter for all outstanding procurement under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) procedures, and consulting assignments by Shortlist. Specific Procurement Notices will be
published in accordance with the procurement plan. The local advertisement procedure would be
repeated for all bidding packages. The local advertisements would be in the English language and
at the option of the Borrower, also in the Turkish language. For consultant services contracts
above US$ 200,000, Requests for Expressions of Interest will be advertised in the Development
Business and in national newspaper (in the national and English languages).
Procurement Arrangements: Procurement under the SRMP includes the contracting of
goods, consultant services, training and local initiatives sub-projects during the 4.25 year
implementation period. The project (total cost US$ 635.46 million including taxes) is financed by
a Loan of US$ 500.00 million and the Turkish Government with a contribution of US$ 135.46
million. Procurement procedures are described in the succeeding paragraphs.
The procurement arrangements under the SRMP are primarily based on the Bank appraisal of
the existing procurement management capability of the SYDTF, including the PCU. A capacity
assessment of the implementing agency has been carried out as per separate report in the project
file. A Procurement Action Plan has been developed, which provides a menu of actions and
- 76 -



recommendations to build procurement capacity in the PCU. Government entities are not eligible
to participate in the World Bank financed contracts unless they meet the criteria under World
Bank Guidelines that they are legally, managerially and financially autonomous, and operate under
commercial Law. Procurement will be under the responsibility of the PCU, formed within the
SYDTF. The PCU will be responsible for project implementation including coordination,
procurement, disbursement, maintaining the project accounts and overall coordination of
implementation by other agencies such as SHCEK and DIE. However, the procurements under
Local Initiatives Component will be implemented by the communities, not by the PCU.
The Project Coordinator has been appointed full-time with TOR and qualifications
satisfactory to the Bank. Under her management, a team comprised of one procurement specialist,
two financial management specialists, one IT specialist, one M&E specialist and two support staff,
will be working for the implementation of the project. In addition to these staff of the full-time
individual consultants in various disciplines (i.e. one procurement specialist, one financial
management specialist, one IT specialist, one reporting/communication specialist) will be hired to
strengthen the PCU with TOR and qualifications satisfactory to the Bank.
Procurement Arrangements:The SRMP has two portions, Adjustment and Investment
(the latter with three components):
*  Adjustment Portion: Rapid Response. There is no procurement in accordance with the
Bank's procedures.  Disbursement will be made against imports, following negative list
procedures.
*  Investment Portion:
3  Component I: Institutional Development. The Bank's procurement policies and
procedures will apply.
i  Component Il: CCT.  There is no procurement in accordance with the Bank's
procedures, because these grants will be distributed according to detailed procedures and
conditions set forth in the POM.
* Component III: Local Initiatives. The Bank's simplified procurement policies and
procedures for community participation investments will apply. These policies and
procedures are set forth in the POM.
Bank-Financed Procurement:   Bank  financed  expenditure items under Institutional
Development Component will be procured as follows:
Goods
(a) International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Goods consisting of computer hardware and
software and related office equipment which are estimated to cost more than US$ 100,000
equivalent per package, will be procured using ICB procedures in accordance with the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines.
- 77 -



(b) International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for procurement of small
quantities of readily available off-the-shelf items, such as basic office equipment estimated to cost
less than US$ 100,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate value estimated at US$
400,000 equivalent.  International shopping procedures will be based on comparing price
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers from two different source countries, in
accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines.
(c) National Shopping (NS).  Miscellaneous small quantities of furniture, goods and
equipment for the dispersed project institutions, of readily available off-the shelf item which do
not exceed US$ 50,000 per contract, may be purchased on the basis of prudent NS. NS
procedures will be based on a comparison of written price quotations obtained from at least three
local suppliers, in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines. The aggregate value of NS
contracts is estimated at US$ 200,000 equivalent.
Consulting Services and Training
(a) Quality and Cost-based Selection (QCBS). QCBS procedures will be used for the
selection of institutions and/or consultant firms that will carry out public opinion research, M&E
and other research activities. The total aggregate value of contracts procured under QCBS is
estimated at about US$ 9.759 million equivalent.
(b) Quality-based Selection (QBS). QBS procedures will be used for the selection of
institutions and/or consultant firms that will carry out training programs under the project. The
total aggregate value of contracts procured under QBS is estimated at about US$ 2.82 million
equivalent.
(c) Consultant Qualifications (CQ) CQ procedures will be used for the selection of
institutions and/or consultant firms that will carry out dispersed/small training programs under the
project and for beneficiary assessments. The contracts will be less than US$ 100,000. The total
aggregate value of contracts procured under CQ is estimated at about US$ 2.31 million
equivalent.
(d) Individual Consultants (IC). Individual consultants would be recruited for specific skill
areas/expertise which would be needed for short periods of time at scattered intervals, and which
would be impractical to package with the assignments for consulting firms described above. The
required social workers for the SYDVs, specialized technical consultants for the Local Initiatives
component and specialists for the PCU will be hired under IC arrangements. The total aggregate
value of contracts procured under IC is estimated at about US$ 2.94 million equivalent.
(e) Least Cost Selection (LCS). The consultant services for the annual financial audit of the
project financial statements and accounts will be procured in accordance with the LCS procedures
in accordance with the Bank Consultant Guidelines.
- 78 -



(f) Procurement of Training Services: The PCU will prepare a detailed Annual Training
Program in consultation with the related organization under the SRMP implementation. The
Annual Training Program will contain time schedule for workshops, training, in-service training,
including detailed information on the content, itinerary, location, number of beneficiaries, cost
estimates for each activity etc. The proposed Annual Training Program will be submitted to the
Bank for review and clearance before starting implementation. After the Bank's clearance, the
program shall be implemented in accordance with the agreed procedures i.e. QCBS, QBS, CQ.
The status of Annual Training Program will be included as part of the Quarterly PMRs and will be
updated and/or modified as may be mutually agreed between the PCU and the Bank.
Procurement of Sub-projects under the Local Initiatives Component:
In accordance with paragraph 3.15 of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, the simplified
procurement procedures for community participation will be applied. The Procurement rules for
this component are set forth in details in the POM. In general procurement will be undertaken
using the Bank's simplified procurement methods for Community Participation in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
i  Income Generating Sub-projects; each sub-project for goods, works and services
estimated to cost less than or equal to US$ 10,000 will be procured competitively
from domestic sources.
*  Employability Training; each sub-project for goods and services estimated to cost
less than or equal to US$ 10,000 will be procured competitively from domestic
sources.
=  Temporary Community Employment; each sub-project for goods and works
estimated to cost less than or equal to US$ 50,000 will be procured through National
Shopping (NS) and/or Minor Works (MW) procedures as mentioned below.
*  Community Social Services; each sub-project for goods and works estimated to cost
less than or equal to US$ 100,000 will be procured through National Shopping (NS),
International Shopping (IS) and/or Minor Works (MW) procedures as mentioned
above.
Minor Works (MW). Small construction works of sub-projects under Local Initiatives
Component estimated to cost less than US$ 50,000 per contract will be procured through MW
based on at least three quotations obtained from qualified domestic contractors in response to
written requests.
As the sub-projects are developed by the communities, the need for contractors, suppliers and
consultants shall be advertised every 6 months in local (village or district level) and/or provincial
newspapers. If no such papers exist, the notice board of the community would be used for the
purpose of advertisement. The applicants shall be registered at the community level and, for
procurements under National Shopping, Minor Works, Consultants Qualifications, quotations
shall be asked from these applicants.

(c) Procurement review for Local Initiatives Component: Procurements under Local
Initiatives Component shall be subject to the Bank's post review and this review shall be carried
out together with the financial post audits.
Action Plan for strengthening the PCU Capacity to Implement Project Procurement
The following actions need to be taken in the order below;
*  The procurement file containing the up-to-date procurement documents such as guidelines,
templates of procurement notices, standard bidding documents for the procurement of goods
under ICB, IS and NS methods, standard request for proposal document for the consultants
services, standard consultants contracts for large and small assignments and for time based
and lump-sum payments, evaluation report formats have been prepared in hard copy and in
electronic version on diskettes and provided to the PCU staff before the Loan Negotiations.
The PCU shall translate into Turkish the related documents for NCB and MW which will be
handled in Turkish.
*  The PAS will organize a one-day procurement familiarization seminar for the PCU staff
including the individual consultants and any other staff who will be potentially involved in
different aspects such as technical, financial, legal aspects of the project. This seminar will
serve to both introduction of Bank's procurement procedures and updating their previous
knowledge. The seminar will be scheduled during the Project Launch Workshop to be held in
September 2001.
*  As mentioned above, SYDTF will hire an experienced procurement consultant for the life of
the project before the effectiveness of the Loan. The procurement consultant will have at least
5 years experience in Bank financed projects and shall work very closely with the procurement
staff of the PCU mainly for the preparation of bidding documents for the procurements to be
carried out in the first year of the new project. The TOR and the CV of the procurement
consultant shall be reviewed and approved by the Bank before signing the contract.

* Although the procurement person had a one week seminar on Bank procurement, he should
attend additional more intensive training especially in the procurement of goods and
consultants services. However, his main handicap is his lack of English language. Therefore,
the procurement team should be supported with some other staff who speaks English. The
procurement staff shall attend intensive procurement training offered by Bank or by ILO in
Tunrn during the early implementation of the SRMP.
*  Each Bank Supervision Mission shall include the PAS assigned to this project to assist the
PCU staff for updating the procurement plan and resolving pending procurement issues to
overcome delays.

Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
The proceeds of the Loan would be disbursed in accordance with the guidelines provided
in the Bank "Disbursement Handbook". The procurement and disbursement arrangements are
based on the Bank's appraisal of the procurement and financial management capability of the
implementing ministry and its institutions, as well as the experience and lessons leamed from
ongoing Bank operations in the HD sector in Turkey. Loan funds are expected to be fully
disbursed within nineteen (19) quarters after the expected effectiveness date of September 15,
2001. The Project Completion Date is December 31, 2005 with a Credit Closing Date of June 30,
2006. The disbursement categories and amounts and percentages to be financed under each
category are presented in Table C, as follows:

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for
contracts for the CCT, local institutions sub-projects, goods, consultant services, training,
accordance in with the table below. Supporting documents for expenditures financed on basis of
SOEs will be retained by PCU for at least one year after disbursement and made available for
review by Bank representatives and external auditors. Disbursement for the Rapid Response
- 87 -



component will be undertaken as a single disbursement to the CBT upon Loan Effectiveness.
All applications to withdraw from the loan will be made in accordance with guidelines set
out in the Bank's disbursement handbook. All applications to withdraw will be fully documented,
except those for training and contracts not subject to prior review, as shown above, for which
reimbursement may be made against certified statements of expenditures SOEs. Project accounts
will be subject to an independent audit for each fiscal year, in accordance with auditing standards
acceptable to the Bank.
SOE Thresholds:
*  Goods:                       contracts costing less than US$ 100,000 equivalent
*  Consulting services - firms:  contracts costing less than US$ 100,000
*  Consulting services - individuals: contracts costing less then US$ 50,000 equivalent
*  Training:                    all contracts
Administration of Disbursement:
The PCU will be responsible for the maintenance of a centrally managed financial
management system (FMS), including records and accounts, for the preparation of financial
statements in a format acceptable to the Bank, adequate to reflect the operations, resources and
expenditures of all withdrawal applications in accordance with Bank's guidelines.
Special account:
In order to facilitate Loan disbursement, the Government will establish a Special Account
in the CBT on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Banks share of
expenditures. The Authorized Allocation for the Special Account would be US$ 15,000,000.
However, during the initial stage of implementation, an amount limited to US$ 5,000,000 will be
deposited in the Special Account. When the aggregated amount of disbursement reaches USS
15,000,000, the amount deposited in the Special Account will be increased to the full authorized
allocation of US$ 15,000,000. The minimum amount of each application should be 20 percent of
the authorized allocation. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be
submitted monthly, or whenever one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs
earlier.
Traditional Disbursement Procedures. The disbursement under the loan will be made in
accordance with traditional disbursement procedures as explained in Disbursement Handbook.
Financial Management
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements: Fiduciary Considerations
The SYDTF is an extra-budgetary fund established by Law No. 3294 dated May 29, 1986.
The SYDTF is administered by a Committee comprising Undersecretary of Prime Ministry,
Undersecretary of Ministry of Interior, Undersecretary of SB, the General Directorate of SYDTF
and the General Director of the SHCEK, under the chairmanship of a State Minister appointed by
- 88 -



the Prime Minister. All of the decisions made at the Committee meetings enter into effect after
approval and ratification by the Prime Minister. The SYDTF does not have its own administrative
capacity and most of its staff members are seconded and paid from ministries or other agencies.
The SYDTF is subject to government regulations on accounting (Uniform Code of Accounts) and
record-keeping. However, the SYDTF is not required to produce financial statements, given its
nature of extra-budgetary fund and tax-exemption status. The SYDTF is subject to annual audits
by the Prime Ministry Supreme Audit Board.
The SYDTF's existing accounting unit is not prepared and adequately staffed to cope with
the increased workload resulting from the project and the existing financial management system is
inadequate to support project accounting/reporting functions (following Government accounting
classifications and conventions) and not supported by the needed internal controls; hence the need
(among other fiduciary areas, where adequate resources and skills are lacking) for the
establishment of a PCU through which specialized information systems and adequate professional
expertise will be made available to the SYDTF.
The PCU will be in charge of project management, administration and concrete
implementation, functioning as service-provider to the various implementing agencies. The PCU
will work as a specialized organizational unit of the SYDTF, with staff from the SYDTF
(counterpart members) and local consultants for the activities where the SYDTF lacks experience,
at present: both fiduciary (disbursement, procurement, project accounting and reporting) and core
finctions (targeting, M&E and public information).
The PCU consists of eight SYDTF staff (already appointed with TOR and CVs
satisfactory to the Bank) and local consultants, namely, a procurement specialist, an accountant, a
disbursement, IT expert, a M&E expert, a reporting and communication expert and two support
staff who will be financed under the SRMP. It will include a liason person each from the SHCEK
and the DIE to facilitate coordination with those institutions.  Job descriptions for the local
consultants, were reviewed and approved by the Bank and hiring is underway. Appointment of
the FMS consultant, along with a functioning FMS, is a Condition of Effectiveness. The SYDTF
will improve its capacity by the support of these qualified professional individual consultants. An
FMS satisfactory to the Bank will be maintained and strengthened by the SYDTF throughout
project implementation.
All fiduciary functions (disbursement, procurement, accounting and reporting) will be
centralized at the PCU level. Thus, the PCU must be not only appropriately resourced, but the
PCU members will need appropriate training in project management and administration. The
SYDTF managed efficiently and effectively the emergency response to the August 1999 Marmara
earthquake, proving itself as the most suitable vehicle to administer assistance transfers in a fast
controlled manner. However, it did not perforn project management and administration functions
for which, at present, there is no capacity in place. Furthermore, the SYDTF lacks written policies
and procedures governing its functions and regulating its relations with the SYDVs.
- 89 -



The SYDVs are separate autonomous legal entities established at the provincial/district
level, managed by their own local Committee, enjoying relative latitude in decision-making and
(given their legal status) exercising some independence in carrying out their activities. For
effective coordination and monitoring by the SYDTF of the SRMP activities carried out by the
SYDVs, the SYDTF will send out a legally binding circular (satisfactory to the Bank) to all 931
SYDVs biding them to the POM and the SRMP Loan Agreement prior to Board. This circular
will spell out respective roles and responsibilities and empowering the SYDTF with authority to
implement specific actions in case of less than satisfactory participation or performance by the
SYDVs. The introduction of standardized procedures and reporting formats will be needed,
which will be one of the outcomes of the establishment of a common, unified FMS (financed
under the Institutional Development component of the SRMP). The excellent performance of the
SYDTF/SYDV under Marmara earthquake emergency will be systematized and documented
under the SRMP, in order to become an efficient, sustainable and transparent social safety-net and
an effective system of social services and assistance catering to the poorest.
In consideration of the accelerated project preparation schedule, it will take an estimated
in two months from appraisal (July 2001) to establish a satisfactory FMS, - including human
resources, software, hardware, policies and procedures documented in the POM  - .  A
satisfactory certification by the Bank FMS of this system is a Condition of Disbursement for the
CCT and Local Initiatives components.
Adjustment Portion: Rapid Response
The adjustment portion of the SRMP will be disbursed in a single tranche based upon
completion of the tranche release conditions. For this portion, the PCU will have accounting and
reporting responsibilities, and the reporting will be in the form of a quarterly progress report.
Consistent with the nature of this operation, implementation arrangements for the
adjustment portion of the loan will be simplified (for instance in terms of financial reporting and
auditing requirements). However, to ensure transparency and sound governance, the
arrangements governing the transfer of funds among the implementing institutions and the
associated supporting documentation and reporting obligations would be spelled out in an
Implementation Agreement to be entered by Treasury and the MB.
Each of the 931 SYDVs will maintain a distinct bank account for the four different types
of assistance (school attendance support, pharmaceuticals, heating and food assistance). This is
needed since the SYDTF will have to prepare quarterly progress reports to the Bank based upon
monthly data. The availability of bank statements for the various SYDVs and type of assistance
would allow the SYDTF to do so, even in the absence of timely, regular and accurate reporting
from the SYDVs. A generalized lack of 'reporting culture' is observable in the SYDVs,
customarily used to receiving funds from the SYDTF but not reporting back on the basis of
standardized formats and/or at regular intervals. The PCU has prepared reporting templates
containing the minimum information to be provided by the SYDVs, which have been reviewed
and approved by the Bank. The PCU will consolidate those records and prepare a summarized
quarterly progress report with monthly data.
- 90 -



Applications will be screened and decided upon by the SYDVs based on the criteria
currently in use and forwarded to SYDTF on a monthly basis for disbursement. Assistance will
be provided to applicants either in cash or in kind. In the latter case, the SYDVs will have to
disclose, or quantify, the monetary equivalent of the benefits provided in their report to the
SYDTF.
Since records and supporting documentation for the transfers will be retained at the single
SYDV level (the SYDTF will only receive a summarized report with attached the list of
applicants/beneficiary and the bank statement), limited compliance audits (basically, documentary
reviews) will be conducted by a governmental audit body across the SYDVs to ascertain that: (i)
proper authorization and fund transfer mechanisms are in place; (ii) adequate filing procedures are
observed (allowing opportune audit trail); and (iii) meaningful budgets and complete summary
reporting, supporting the next-period disbursement request, are prepared by the SYDVs and sent
to the SYDTF.
The diagram presented below summarizes the flow of funds, relating supporting
documentation, reporting lines and documentary reviews for the adjustment portion of the SRMP.

Investment Portion
For the implementation of the investment components, the detailed, specific financial
management arrangements and flow of funds and applicable controls for each component are
described below.   The PCU will establish a financial management system meeting Bank
requirements. The system will entail adequate staffing (in terms of number and skills), will be
supported by a suitable accounting software and will be assisted by an adequate control
environment and a combination of ex-ante and ex-post external audit arrangements.
All the elements described will be documented in a Financial Management Manual, which
will be an integral part of the POM, which is a condition of disbursement for the CCT and Local
Initiatives components. The POM will document, inter alia: (i) organization and management
structure of project implementation; (ii) job description for PCU team members; and (iii)
operational procedures to be followed; and (v) project management reporting and external
reporting classifications, formats and frequency, PMRs, procurement reports, audit reports, etc.
The diagram presented above summarizes the flow of funds, relating supporting
documentation, reporting lines, ex-ante audits (for the CCT) and external auditing arrangements
for the investment components of the SRMP.
(I) Institutional Development Component
The SYDTF and SYDVs needs have been identified in the institutional assessment (see
Annex 13) and supported by the results of the operational review conducted by an international
accounting and consulting firm  (PriceWaterhouseCoopers, PWC) under the EERL.  The
institutional strengthening of the SYDTF and the SYDVs will involve the implementation of the
key agreed recommendations of the operational review conducted by the consultants in the
context of the EERL (which have been accepted by the SYDTF and the Government) requiring,
inter alia, the introduction of unified procedures, the development of formal financial reporting
arrangements between the SYDTF and the SYDVs and the establishment of an integrated MIS.
The SYDTF needs a complete overhaul of its information system, especially in respect of
tools for networking and interfacing with the SYDVs, primarily the creation of a unified data-base
and real-time data sharing. In this respect, detailed functional and technical specifications are
already available (prepared by PWC). These specifications, with small adaptations, will form the
basis for the (RFP) for the new MIS. The project accounting software and related equipment for
the PCU will be financed under this component, with the initial assistance of the PHRD. All
beneficiaries will be required to introduce a maintain a fixed asset register for the equipment
financed by Loan proceeds.
- 94 -



(II) CCT Component
The CCT will be implemented by relying on existing networking arrangements and
procedures envisaged under the Rapid Response component, thereby avoiding placing an
enormous administrative burden on the SYDTF. Thus the CCT would use a decentralized
approach, whereby the SYDTF would provide (monthly) periodic allocations to the SYDV. The
SYDV would then arrange payments, maintain records and prepare summary reports for the PCU,
administer the payments through a bank with which the SYDTF will enter into a contractual
arrangement.
To strengthen the accountability and transparency of the whole process, pre-audits of
CCT will be conducted by a governmental audit body under TOR already agreed with the Bank.
The pre-audits, although conducted in a systematic way, would be not generalized: in
consideration of the large number of micro-payments involved, the risk that this safeguard
measure slows down implementation of the CCT program must be avoided. The pre-audits
would rather represent a verification of the transparency and correctness of payments'
administration, conducted by an independent third party, covering a representative random sample
of transactions, and carried out on a rotational basis throughout all SYDVs. The purpose of the
pre-audits would, in fact, be to provide reassurance to all stakeholders that the whole process is
adequately controlled; in this respect, auditors would: (i) review the information prepared by the
SYDVs on the claims/payable benefits for the given period under examination; and (ii) would
cross-reference the compiled requests with the list of beneficiaries and the single payment advises
(for the beneficiary) and payment orders (for the bank), in order to ascertain the reliability of the
mechanisms supporting cash releases. The verification would also extend to the adequacy of the
accounting records maintained and supporting documentation filed in respect of the transactions
under examination. Based on the positive results of the pre-audit, the SYDV would make funds
available to the beneficiaries, sending payment instructions to the relevant commercial bank(s).
(III) Local Initiatives Component
The process entails SYDVs, municipalities, communities, NGOs etc. presenting their
sub-project proposals to the SYDTF for screening and approval. The sub-project cycle would
also involve the support of Service Providers (for instance Associations, NGOs, etc. already
experienced in the management of the relevant sub-project activities) that would support
sub-projects' execution, contribute to monitoring and evaluation on behalf of the SYDTF and also
function as an intermediate layer, between the SYDV and the beneficiaries, when this might be
useful.  The administration of sub-project financing entails disbursement in several installment
based on specific triggers linked to measurable physical progress.
An integrated MIS, financed under the Institutional Development component, will be
introduced within the SYDTF/SYDVs, which would strengthen the institutions' targeting and
M&E capabilities and facilitate scrutiny and oversight functions under the project. It is believed
that the elements of self-control generally embedded in the Local Initiatives (due to the collective
control exercised over sub-projects execution and the use of related resources by the investing
- 95 -



groups or community) is another element positively contributing to the establishment of an
adequate control environment for this component's activities.
Control Environment
Project accounting/reporting policies and procedures, as well as administrative routines
will be documented in the Financial Management Manual (which will include the accounting
software user's manual), representing an integral part of the POM. The PCU staffing should
ensure adequate division of labor, segregation of duties and clear reporting lines. The acceptance
by the Bank of the POM is a Board condition.
No project funds will be transferred directly to the beneficiaries or any other implementing
agency outside the project's documented framework.   All implementing agencies (SYDVs,
SHCEK and DIE) will enter into Participating Agency Agreements spelling out roles and
responsibilities of all parties to the agreement.
All payments for goods and services procured under the project, as well all Special
Account draw-downs for the Rapid Response component (for which the MB is in charge of
disbursement) as well as withdrawal applications for the non-adjustment components will have the
joint signature of the SYDTF General Secretary and the PCU Coordinator, or their delegated
representatives.
Budgetary control represents the primary financial control safeguard, by way of
preparation by the PCU of a consolidated work plan for the project, to be approved by the
Axdvisory Board, the Treasury and the Bank. However, in consideration of the demand-driven
nature of several programs financed under the project, the preparation of accurate estimates might
prove difficult and will require strict cooperation with SYDVs and other implementers and the
need, for the PCU, to refine its planning and forecasting, as well as its M&E capabilities. For this
reason, PMR-based disbursement is not recommended. Disbursement will be made in accordance
with traditional disbursement procedures throughout the life of the project.
Auditing Arrangements
Consolidated annual project financial statements for the investment components will be
audited by the Treasury Controllers in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA)
and under TOR already cleared by the Bank. An appropriate Government audit body will carry
out documentary reviews of the activities under the Rapid Response component and pre-audit of
payments - on a selective but systematic basis - under the CCT under TOR already cleared by the
Bank.
At the conclusion of the first year of project implementation (end of year 2002), an
operational review of the activities carried out under the project (financed by Loan proceeds) will
be conducted by the Treasury Controllers together with an independent, private sector
accounting/consulting firm under TOR already cleared by the Bank.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies
The risks in this operation are considered substantial both from the financial control
perspective and reputational risk perspective. Besides the standard audit requirements to be
applied in respect of both the adjustment and the investment portions of the SRMP, a number of
measures have been agreed to minimize the risks identified in the various activities, which are
summarized below:
*  Documentary reviews in respect of the adjustment component (Rapid Response) by a
Governmental audit body;
* Pre-audits of payments under the CCT, carried out by a Governmental audit body on a
selective, but systematic basis; and
*  Operational review for the whole project, carried out at the end of the first year of
implementation by the Treasury Controllers together with an independent, private sector
accounting/consulting firm.
Action Plan
The SRMP will be subject to a detailed review and re-assessment of its adequacy to
support project activities, to be conducted by the project FMS. The graduation of the system
from inadequate to satisfactory, as required by OP/BP 10.02 and the Financial Management
Initiative, is a condition of disbursement for the CCT and Local Initiatives components.
To achieve this, the Bank and the Borrower agreed upon the details of a time-bound
action plan specifying the steps necessary for the development of a financial management system
meeting Bank's minimum fiduciary requirements prior to the first disbursement under the
investment components. The further strengthening of the system and the maintenance of a
satisfactory FMS throughout the life of the SRMP will be monitored by the Bank during
supervision (this will be ensured by the availability of an FMS staff in the Bank's Ankara Office.

Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
1818 H Street NW
Washington, DC 20433
USA
Dear Mr- Wotfensohn,
Letter of Sector Pollcy on Social Risk Mitigation, Social Assistance and
Poverty Reduction
This Letter of Sector Policy (LSP) sets out the main features of Turkey's
proposed reforms for social risk mitigation, social assistanc and poverty
reduction policy, This proposed reform program is significant. and wfll lead
Turkey to a new phase in its social risk mitigation, social assistance and poverty
reduction policy - one that is more in line with Turkey's neighbors In the
European Union (EU) and best practice globally.
Social and Poverty lnpact of the Cris and Rfofrm Program. The
social impact of the recent economic crisis is already beirg felt as laoy-of, rising
prices, and negative growth reduce household incomes and place a growing risk
of poverty and vulnerability on people already at the lower end of the Income
scale. Industry's initial perception is that the cri6is is unprevodented In its
severity In comparison to previous crisis due, in part, to the spillover effects of the
problems caused by the Russian crisis in 1998-1999 and oarthquakes in 199
and the November 2000 crisis. Unemploymvent has riswn from 6.6 percent In
2000 and is projected to increase to around 8-5 percent as a result of the crftss.
This has provided a renewed impetus to the Government to strengthen our social
safety-net and improve our policies.
In March 2001, a simulation of tthe irnpact of the crisis on the wehare
distribution was done using household data from 1994, to identify the
characteristics of the most vulnerable households, This sirmlation suggested
five paterns of likely increased poverty as a result of the recent financial crisis:
(i) families with many children and extended families with many chidren, as well
as singleparent families, seem to be the most affected in terms of hih rate and
high increases in poverty- (ii) an ircrease in unemployment would
disproportionately affect families with many children; (iii) those with middle
education seem more lIkely to bcome vulnerable - but still above the povwty
- 107 -



line - while the least educated ame those mot likely to become poor; (lv) the three
regions of Anatoria have the highest rates of vulnerabgity and poverty but not
always the h-igest incrases in those ctaracteristics; and (v) the urban
population seerns more at risk for vulnerability but there is not much difference
between urban and rural households in terms of the risk of poverty.
Overall R.ftn  Program. The financial and public sector reforms that
would be supported by the Wofid Bank, IMF and the intemational community, will
have imporant social benefits and will support the Government's poverty
reduction effrts. These structurl refrms are designed to help pull the economy
out of rnession and restore growth as soon as possible which is the key to
minimizing job loss, and the social and poverty impact of the crisis. Restored
confidence in the financial sector will help reverse the on-going credit crunch and
generate new resources for nmnic recovery and ob creation. The public
sector reforms will help ensure the quality of the fiscal adjustment and improve
overall efficiency of social servie  delivery.  Better public expenditure
management will Increase tw availabiry of resources for social expenditures.
Actions to upgrade the operatkoa performance of line ministies and agencies,
including incresed  nphasila on policy fortulatn and a progressive shift to
performance budgeting, wil help ensure that these additonal resources are used
effectively to fight poverty and vulnerability. The program features institutional
and policy measures to improve the operational performance of line ministries
and agencies including those responsible for basic social services. Action under
the program to iemproe public governance and tackle oorruption are likely to
benefit the poor dlspropooately as shown in numemus intematonal studies.
Structural reform of the financ:ial and public sectors is also crucial to avoid future
crisis which would likely be devastating for the poor.
Thus the Govemment's overall reform program is based on a three-
pronged strtegy: (i) strctural policies aired at orrecbtng the weaknesses
undertying the crisis and establishing a sounder basis for disinflation and growth
over the medium term; (i) strong social polices Including enhanced social
diaogue to achieve pric, and wage policies consistent with macroeconomic
stabiity, and increased emphasis on the protection of the most vuinerable groups
of society; and (iil) fiscal and monetary polcies geared towards restoring financial
stabilty and resming the disinflation proess. It Is very well understood that a
productive and srtrong private sector is needed to be a strong and reputable state
in the 21st century. In the same way, in order to have a sound free market
economy, it is important to have a strong state providing social support to the
needy and undertaking egulatry supervision. A strong economy will be created
by a functioning prate sector, an effetive state, and a broad social solidarity.
This is our taoret what we are koging for, and indeed it is what Tukey deserves.
Maintaining social cohesion is especially important given the poitical volatiWi
and social stres of the oontry. Mreetng the fiscal cost of prgrnms to support
social cohesion and protec vulnerable groups within the overall fiscal adjustment
will be a chalenge.

Protcting Publc ixpendiure In the Social Setor  The Government i
Is strengthening Turkeys social protetion programs and is committd to
ptectng social spending. Protecting expenditr on health, education and
social protcton from the impact of the cwse  is a key social objectiv.
OtherMw. Tures human capil will suffer nd the burden of adjusmtent wil
fal on vulnerable groups. A supplementary budget for 2001 was approved by
ParlIant in June which is consistent with the Governments maceconomic
objectves and also ensures adequate expenditure enwelopes for heatth,
educatin and social protecion. The budget nWntins aggregat spending on
educaton slghtly above the average levels of 1992000 (as a share of GNP)
and prgmrms a signficat increase in exediture on social protection relativf
to 2000 rsulting In part from he launch of the Direct ncome Support (D1S)
program for farmers. Overall puic spending on heatth is also projected to
remain above the i98*-2000 avorage levol. Savings are expected to coe from
efflciency ans In heah expendItures for civil servants under the administrative
reform of the social securt  system, but part of these savings ar being
chanrad into increased expenditure on preventive an  ptimary care  Th3
prelimnary outcome for spending on health, education and soial protection
under the 2001 budget will be monitored in Ocoer  Benchmarks for public
spening on healfth, educatin and social protection as shares of GNP agreed
with the Bank have been estabUshed for the program  These benchmark hawe
been set at a level somewhat above the averages for the 1998-2000 period,
reflecting the Govenment's policy decision to enure adequate expenditure on
soci prioritis.   nificant deviations from  e program benchmarks will be
disussed with the Bank with the aim of determining appropriate corretive
action. The Government is commited to allocatng satisfactory experditure
envelopes fbr social programs in the 2002 budget
Sial Policies. Sroner social policies are a linchpin of the program to
help dea with social harshjps. There are four aspects to this,
(i)  Improved socal dialogue. In April, a law was adopted to formalize
the role of the Econmit and Social Council, Henceforth, the Council,
which btings togeher the Government, labor unions and employees under
t  chairnanship of the Prim* Minister, wvil hold regular and feuent
meetings. A cetral function of the Council is to enable an intensive
dIakgjue on wages and prices with employr and trade unions to take
plac*.
(ii)  Incomes poicy. While the purchasing power of civil servants wil
be prottd against erosion by inflation, real wages for public sector
workr ar expected to be reduced takng into account the ral Increases
acorded in 1992000. Agreement on an income packge was reached
between the Govemrmert and the labor unions in May 2001.
(ii) 5Socl protection. Effots to strengthen the social insurance
system will contnue. The existng severance payment system which
- 109 -



covers both public and private enteiprises continues to operate. The
unemployment ineurance program, introduced as part of the reform of tie
public pension system in August 1999, will begin to make patyments to the
enrolled unemployed in early 2002. Structural refom of the pension
system continues to progress with the adoption in April of egslatlon fhr
the third voluntary pension pillar (private pensions). The Governmfnt
intends to move quickly to expand targeted social assistance to those
groups most affected by the crisis. This support could include programs to
protect vulnerable fairrles (such as asstance with food. medioine and
social services). The DIS program to farmers, supported by the SanIs
Agricuttural Reforrn Implementation Prject (ARIP) will be iniiated in 2001,
as part of the agricultural reform. It will also help farmers -especially
smaWl farmer - deal with the crisis. The ongoing Privatization Social
Support Projet (PSSP) will provide enhanced social protecton to workers
laid off as a result of privatization and enterpise restructuring.
(iv) Social aervices. Spending on immunizfiontraccinabion programs
will be increased in real terms within the overall budget ceiling. The
Govermment intends to protect public expenditure on education, as well as
increase the public health budget while reducing waste within the overall
health budget. as noted in the table above.
However, the reform program also envisions an expansion of existing in-
lind transftrs as a way to cushion the social impact of the recent financial crisis.
The goal of the reform program is to improve social assistance system in Turkey
that is targeted to the poorest, and which wil provide not only a "safety*net for
the poor, but also a *trampoline" to help the poor escape poverty.
Social Risk Mitigation. A key lement of strengthening thes social
policies, complementing the support of the PSSP, ARIP and the Programmatic
Financial & Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) I, is developing stronger
social risk migation, management and prevention measurs,   picipal
measures are. (1) instutional strengthening - sengthening the institutional basis
and capacity of those agencies irwolved in socia risk mitigation in order to
improve social risk mitation, management and prevention polcies over the
medium to long-term; (ii) conditional cash transfers (CCO) - Introducing CCT. a
highly targetd social astistance transfer to families with children, requir'ing
positive family behavioral change with respect to health and educatioo, which
resonates with the EU policy of child allowances; and (iii) local initiatives -
expanding the active eenok t of Turkey's social safety-net through Increased
support to incomeenerating, youth employability, adult literacy and tempoirry
communitv employmen related social infrastructure network, as driven by local
community demand.
Turkey requests the support of the Worid Bank in the form of a hybrid loan
of; US $500 rmillion for the Social Risk Mitistion ProjecULoan (SRMP), to assist
In the implemetatio of these reforms including the development of the new
-110-



CCT socal sistance system In Turkey. The SRMP will consist of two portkon:
(i) an adjustment portion of US$ 100 million to prvide immediate social
assistance in kind to the rnost vuberable groups affected by the c* s - thereby
mitigating immediate socEl risks; and (i) an investment portio of US$ 4M0
million to povide for the protection of the hunan capil of poor cildren and to
convey techrical assistance and inseutfota  strngthning, icluding the
management infonaon system and reatd hardwar needs, covering three
components of th  SRMP -  inslituonal dvalopment, the CCT and local
initiatives.
1. Social Risk WHton-mmadiate Response to the Crisis
The aim of the adjusment porion is to bring inmmediate relief to vulnerable
groups through existin channes, since it is not possible within a short timne to
prepare now delery mechanism  (which will be devloped subsquerety under
the investment portion of te oan). This poftion wouid finanoo Turkeys pubfic
and private sector import requirenents of the balance of payments (BOP). The
Government will we the Turkih Ura (TL) counrtrpart of the loan funds to finance
priority actions for inMediate refief to vulnerable groups sfferiing from the impact
of the recent economic crsis. This porftion will firarne up-front balance of
payments support to bolster Turkey's internatlonal reserves, as well as budgetary
support to help fund spending priortes for vublerable groups.
It is proposed that the T counterpart spending ensist of three areas of
expenditures tWgeted to tVe poorest famriies through existing mechanisms of the
Social Solidarity Fund (SYDTF) and ts afiTated Social Solidarity Foundations
(SYDVs) which could be made rapidly:
* school attan4ans packapm - required before Septenber 11 - the start of
the school year,
a phrmsaceuticas & medical supplies far poor "green-cardw holders and
poor non'reencard holders including h disabled; and
* social assistnce in cash and kind to those wort affected by the crisis.
The SYDTF has indicatd that it could rapidly move the US$ 100 million
through its existing channels and existing selection mechanism (local
committes) for bgrwciarte, similar to ts very successful performance in
delering cash beneft undew the Emergency Earthquake Recovery Loan. The
SYDTF Identified these thre area as ones in whch it could rapidly scale up
eistitng programs and in which the need is greatest following the recent
economic cisis.  The SYDTF does hve some temporary community
mployment program  in a few SYEs. bWt these temporay community
enpl*yment progams aimited both in scope and number, and could not be
expanded quickly.
Although the resources for the adjustment porbon would be for budgetary
support and Blarnce of Payment (BOP) financine, it is critcal that an addifional
-111 -



budgetary allocation be made for increasing the SYDTF's budget by the US$ 100
million equivalent to cover the cost of the increased spending on the emergency
measures for back-to-school, medicine, and local socia assistance. To this end,
Treasury has already transferred sufficient funds for the procurement of the
school attendance packages for approxinately 1.05 million children to the
SYDTF (estimated at TL 40 triion). Morover, Trasuwy wit ensure that the
SYDTF receives sufficient domestic finawce to undertake agreed cumulative
expenditures of TL 550 tiilon (indluding the TL equivalent of the SRMP
adjustnent portion) by Decemrber 31. 2001, subct to. (a) disbusement of the
adjustment portion of the SRMP before December 31, 2001; and (b) any
justifiable fiscal revisions neessitated by Government's economic program or
economic and financial circumstances.
The projectd expenditures of the SYDTF for the second half of 2001 are
estimated at TL 381 triUlon (nckuding an estimated TL 125 trililon from the SRMP
financing) a substantal increase over the first half-year's expenditures of TL 169
trillion expenditures, making total expenditures for the year of TL 550 trillion.
The use of a tading mechanism to follow the flow-of-funds from the Bank
loan through countepart eqivalentldeposit account to the SYDVs would be
required. This is exactly the sarne existing mechanism already used successfully
in the Emergency EaMquae Reovery Loan (EERL).
if. Social Risk Miigation, Management & Prevention-Mediun & Long-term
Social Insurance: The Goverment of Turkey has been working to
improve its social safett, and especialty to refomn the social security system.
The reforms are necessary because the system was insolvent In the past and the
level of benefits was not sustainable. The first phase of social security reform
consists of modfications to ihe public pay-as-you-go pension system to stem
operating losses. induding raising the retirement age for now entants. The
secnd phase ofe social security reform strategy, planned for 2002, focuses
on strangtning t  organizational underpinnings of the systsm. extending its
ooverage, separating the pension system from associated health Insurance and
unemployment schemes, and eliminating accumulated arrears The third phase
is to introduce a frameowrk for supplenentary individual pension schemes.
These reforms will bring forward a more targeted and sustainable social security
system for old-age, but wi1l o1ty insure aganst one kind of risk - that of
insufficient savings in old-age.
A comprehensive socal safety-net helps to insure against the risks of
unemploynwnt and poverty. Unfortunately, there are several large gaps in bte
social safety-net in Turkey. Turkey has only reocently adopted unemployment
benefits, but due to the perod of rquired coributions, peopte will not be able to
draw unemployment benefit until 2002. So, those who becorne jobless as a
result of the recent financial crisis will not have unemploymnent insurance to
support thern while tthey search for other jobs.

Ned for Social Asshftnc: The Turkith social safety-not consists of
social insurance (pensions and disabity) which ar tied to an individual hving a
job in the formal sector. With the exception of the Bag-Ku social insurance plan
for the self-employed, the wtole socil security system io rnked to holding a
formal job (including the newly-Introduced unemployet Isurnce). Such a
system runs te distinct risk of exckuding those wihout a connection to the formal
labor market Households headed by seasonal or casual worker (workers
witout a labor contract) are at high risk of poverty and economic vulnerability.
TurkeyWs social protecn system lacks a bet that would be targeted to these
vulnerable groups.
Turkey** existing Social Asasetane Is quit limitd. Turkey does not
have a poverty benrefit-a cash ransfer that is target to the vulnerable-which
could be used to help those negatively affectd by the reform. Social assistance
in Turkey is limited to ad hoc assistancie In cash and in kind channeled through
the 931 SYDVs, and limited prgrmos for the elderly and disabled under Law
2022, as well as institutional care for children and the elderly administed by
SHCEK. Turkey has no otte cash tansfer that could help the vulneable,
unlike many neighboring countries of Western and Eastem Europe, which have
universal child alowances. CCT would help to address the inadequacy in
Turkey's social assistance system by providing an incentive to poor children to
stay in school and for pro-scool children to be regulary taken to health clinics.
This letter lays out a vision for social assistance in Turkey and the required
strategy of the evoliton and furer developmen of the social protection system
in Turkey. Key componen of this viion incudeu

the human capital of the children who do not typically return to school after the
crisis, and a perpetuation of the cycle of poverty across generations.
CCT provide an incentive to the poor to: (i) keep their children in school
and work on the demand side of education by covering the out-of-pocket
expenses that often preclude the poor from sending their children to school; and
(il) obtain adequate pro-natal care, basic health and nutrion servces (including
immunization, growth monitoring and resolving micro-nutrient deficiencies). CCT
are typically targeted to the poor by proxy means tests or income tests, In
Turkey, a large informal sector means that income-testing would be too
expensive and difficult, so a scoring formula based on a proxy means test is
recommended. CCT are an important mechanism to protecting the human
capital of the vulnerable.
CCT are an inportant tool in the battle against the inter-generational
transfer of poverty, since children who fail to complete basic education today
become the poor of tomorrow. Due to need for detailed preparation, the CCT
wvvould need to be carefully monitored and evaluated to determine whether it Is
achieving its objectives and deternmine the duration of the program. A full review
would be undertaken before December 31. 2003.
identificaotIn and selection of beneficiaries.
Virtually all of the SYDVs in Turkey identfy the needy and select them for
assistance by the deliberations of a local committee, which is headed by the
Kaymakam (District Govemor) at the district level and by the Governor or Vice-
Gzovernor at the provincial level. While local officials may have access to local
knowledge about the applicants, they lack training in social work and social
assessment.
Many countries have found the uso of a scoring formula to lead to
outcomes that are more equitable and efficient than the decisions of local
committees. Turkey has limited experience wth scoring formulas. Turkey wNll
need up-to-date household data from a soci-economic surey to develop a
national scoring formula. A major advantage of a scoring formula is that it can be
used to rank households according to their level of poverty, and different scial
assistance programs can use different cut-off points for eligibility. This would
make it possible to target COT and other food and social assistance to the most
needy, while targeting other programs such aS income generation and training to
those not as vulnerable.
Enhanced Legal Basis for SYDTF and SYlV:.
Legislation is expected to be enacted by December 31,2001 to strengthen
the SYDTF organizational structure and reporting practices and enabling the
SYDTF and $YC)Vs to work more effectively with NGOs. The Government will
submit this legislation to Parliament by the Board presentation of the SRMP.

Promotion of employabUlty and micro-busrinw.
A passive social assistance system is not suffiient and must be
supplented by an actve program  aimed at helping to improve the
employability of the poor (basic skills - elated to market demands, literacy,
numeracy, interviewng and job-search skills. coping-with-life-skills). Additional
support for starting micro-businesses and other income generating activities for
the poor will be provided. All these activities need to be relevant to the market
demands and of high technical quality and thus the Govemment proposes to
work ever more cdely wih the private sector. especially chwnbers of commerce

Annex 12
TURKEY: Social Risk Mitigation Project
CCT Issues and International Experience
Targeting Issues for the CCT. Most governments can not afford to provide universal
social benefits because of the very high cost of universal benefits. Most countries choose to
target their assistance to the poor or poorest, on grounds of equity and because of the fiscal
constraints. Several methods have been used internationally to target benefits to the poor.
Self-targeting. Self-targeting is when a government provides a benefit that is so low that
only the poor are interested in receiving the benefit. Positive examples include a food subsidy for
a low-quality food product that only the poor consume, or a public works program where the
wage is kept so low (lower than the minimum wage) that only the poor are willing to work for it.
Negative examples include the creation of difficult bureaucratic procedures that require so much
time and difficulties that only the desperate will try to obtain the benefit.
Geographic targeting. Combining population census with socio-economic survey data
allows the construction of a poverty map. The poverty map can be used to target poor localities.
For example, in the CCT program Progesa in Mexico, a poverty map is used to select the poorest
villages in rural areas and the individuals are selected based on a proxy means test. Every child in
the village then receives the CCT as long as the conditions are met.
Expert evaluation. In some countries, social workers or other informed local sources
such as teachers, decide who is poor enough to be eligible for social assistance. In Jamaica social
workers currently decide who benefits from the Poor Relief program, but Jamaica is seeking to
reform its safety net by adopting a scoring formula (see below) which will free social workers
from home inspection and allow them to provide social services and counseling to clients.
Income-testing. In the USA and several European countries, income-testing is used to
verify household income and eligibility for social assistance. Income-testing is cost-efficient only
when there is a culture of tax declarations for both individuals and companies and computer
systems which can verify and check the income declaration. For example, in the USA, social
assistance applicants must provide their most recent tax declaration and their social security
(identification) number. Computer checks are then run on the identification number to verify the
declared income. Income-testing does not work well in countries where there are large informal
or subsistence agricultural sectors, since it is very difficult to verify informal income. Sending an
inspector to the home of each applicant is extremely expensive administratively is normally only
done for a random sample of applicants or in special cases where there is evidence of fraud.
Scoring formula. Scoring formula (also called proxy means-testing or combined
indicator targeting) is a technique whereby the household's living standards are estimated based
on a series of indicators that are found to be correlated with poverty in that country. The
indicators are typically things like the number of children and elderly in the household, the housing
material and amenities (such as water and electricity), number of rooms, and often, consumer
- 117 -



durable goods (refrigerators, cars) and in agricultural areas, household holdings of livestock and
land.
Such scoring fornula have been widely used in Latin America (including Chile,
Colombia), a province of Russia and in other former Soviet Union countries, and are being
developed for Ghana and Jamaica, among other countries. Scoring formula are best derived from
quantitative household survey data, and can be differentiated by urban/rural or major
geo-economic zones of a country (such as East and West in Turkey). Turkey has experience with
scoring formula--in Van province, the SYDV uses a scoring fornula developed by the Director of
SHCEK, and the SYDTF uses a scoring formula for the allocation of scholarships.
The SRMP includes several sources of survey infornation that will be used to devise and
regularly update a scoring formula for targeting the CCT and Local Initiatives. First, the World
Bank is co-financing a household survey partly from its operational budget, with the remainder of
the support from the Government of Japan (PHRD Grant). This household survey is being
conducted by local consultants drawing on the Middle East Technical University (ODTU) with
technical assistance from the World Bank. The household survey will provide the data necessary
for these key indicators: (i) poverty levels and household consumption; (ii) profile of poverty; (iii)
access to health and educational services by the poor and non-poor; (iv) poverty correlates which
will be combined into a scoring fornula that will be used in SRMP components; (v) extensive
information on health indicators; and (vi) limited information on labor and unemployment (DIE
has a regular program of labor force surveys).
Additionally, the institutional strengthening component of the SRMP provides for
financing of two additional household surveys over the next four years with interviews and data
entry conducted by consultants to the State Institute of Statistics (DIE). Finally, a rigorous
impact evaluation of the conditional cash transfers (CCT) component of the SRMP will be
conducted, including a baseline and follow-up survey. Targeting criteria for the CCT and Local
Initiatives component will be updated to take into account these new sources of statistical
information and to ensure that as the poverty profile changes, the targeting criteria will be
adjusted.
SYDV Selection criteria and health. The lack of clear-cut selection criteria by the
SYDVs impedes their effectiveness. The SYDTF does provide social assistance quickly (soup
kitchens, health services for a limited number of cases lacking Green Cards (health benefits cards),
elderly; poor families in disaster situations or at special occasions). However, the targeting and
selection criteria for assistance are discretionary rather than according to pre-set, well defined
criteria and target groups such as would be provided by a scoring formula. Even for the Green
Card for health services, the targeting is not very clear since to some extent the selection criteria
for who has Green Cards can be arbitrary. The use of a scoring formula would be a way to move
away from arbitrary decisions and bring more objectivity in the selection process.
International Experience with CCT. There is significant experience with CCT in
several countries, particularly in Latin America.

Conditional Cash Transfers
Definitions and Experience
Cash payments given to poor households who fulfill a set of conditions - usually a standard
number of preventive care visits for children under five and enrollment and good attendance
for school-aged children. Large programs of this nature have been established and evaluated
in Mexico and Brasilia (school portion only) and new programs have been or are about to be
launched in Honduras, Nicaragua, other parts of Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Jamaica.
The programs are targeted to poor families, usually with a proxy means test, and sometimes
(Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua) restricted to poor districts identified with a poverty map.
Mexico's Progresa program increased primary enrollment rates by about one percentage
point (base of 90 percent for boys and 94 percent for girls) and secondary rates by 8 percent
for girls (base of 67 percent) and 5 percent for boys (base of 73 percent). Prenatal care in
the first tri-mester rose 8 percent, the incidence of disease among children under five was
reduced by 12 percent. Preliminary evidence shows that Brasilia's Bolsa Escola program
participants have lower dropout rates than non-participants (0.4 versus 5.6 percent), higher
promotion rates (80 versus 70 percent) are more likely to enter school at the right age and
have similar learning outcomes.
Pros and Cons
*Tie together short run assistance and long run human capital formation to help break the
intergenerational cycle of poverty.
*Ensure families are proactive in seeking their own welfare.
*Add a demand side tool to help obtain desired health and education sector outcomes.
*May address gender issues by giving greater incentives to girls and/or by making mothers the
recipients of the cash.Most poor children already get primary education and many get health
care and secondary education.
Usually exclude poor families without children in the right age range.
Require good physical access and quality of services to ensure human capital development.
Proxy Means Tests
Definitions and Experience
Proxy means test use a handful of easily observable characteristics about a household to
calculate a score that indicates how well off the household is. Entry into various programs
or the benefit levels are decided based on the household's score. The indicators and weights
in the scoring formula are the result of a sophisticated statistical analysis of national
household survey data. The indicators include location and quality of housing, ownership of
durable goods, features of household demographics, human capital and sometimes labor
force activity.
Pros and Cons
*Verifiable, may allay concerns over politicization or randomness of benefit assignment
(especially among program administrators).
*Single targeting system may be used for several programs, which maximizes return for fixed
overhead.
*Uses easy to observe variables strongly correlated with poverty in market economies.May
seem mysterious or arbitrary to some (especially among clients and critics).

Sophisticated system, requires moderate to high levels and quality of  information,

Not sensitive to quick changes in welfare, as experienced in a crisis or in some transition
countries.
Conditional Cash Transfers with Proxy Means Tests
Bottom Lines
*A new and increasingly popular element in safety nets programs.
*Best suited to settings where poverty is chronic and human capital outcomes low despite
efforts to provide extensive and good quality services.
*Require significant administrative capacity for targeting, for verifying that conditions are
met, to get transfers to individuals and to coordinate among the several agencies (ministries
of welfare, health, education, planning, local govenmment) and many local agents of each
(clinics, schools, municipalities, banks) .

Exclusion. A non-negligible share of the poorest population may actually be excluded
from any kind of social assistance due to a lack of demand for services. The reasons might be a
combination of factors:
3 The lack of information on the availability of social assistance programs among the
poorest both in rural and urban areas.
* The reluctance of low-educated male heads of households to apply for any outside
assistance.
* Within the household, the difficulty of women in traditional families to make their voices
heard to ask for assistance.
The reluctance of women to address their needs to officials sometimes sent to villages to
identify the needy.
The cumbersome procedures that the beneficiaries have to go through for an assistance
which is not large in scope and not continuous;
_ In some remote rural areas, the difficult access to a SYDV and the cost involved in travel
which can exceed the benefit.
* Language difficulty to communicate with officials.
* Informal transactions that are made to avoid paying taxes on the sales of durables are not
officially registered so that the poor who have sold informally some durables (cars, etc..)
may not be eligible because they cannot prove the transaction.
*   Another concem  for exclusion is the discretionary nature of assistance allocation,
especially with respect to projects and boarding school scholarships. Connections seem
to play a role in being included in the projects as well as in the allocation of boarding
school places.
*   Difficulty to obtain official documents for those who have migrated. For some of the
residents of the gecekondus in major cities who have migrated from other parts of the
country, the process to apply for Green Cards and other benefits is difficult and costly due
to the requirement that they have to prove that they do not own anything in their villages
of origin.
- 120-



Required Behaviors of Individuals. Detailed specifications behavioral requirements are
critical in the success of a CCT program. In Colombia, a student can be absent from school up to
4 days in any given month in order for the household to which s/he belongs to qualify for the
benefit payment for the month. No unexcused exceptions are permitted, but a doctor's note is
accepted for an excused absence, which is also the case proposed for Jamaica. Furthermore, in
Ecuador, it was proposed to revoke the child's eligibility permanently once the child has failed to
meet attendance requirements for 3 consecutive payment cycles.
Considerations Regarding  Supply-side  Constraints.   Sometimes certain  local
conditions do not allow beneficiaries to fulfill their behavioral requirements, which may be met
under different circumstances. If for example, a local health post or clinic is not adequately
equipped nor staffed, does it make sense to make benefit payments to the periodic visit to such a
health post? Requiring the beneficiaries to visit a better equipped and staffed but distant health
post, but such a requirement could increase the costs to the beneficiaries, and make them less
responsive to the CCT program.
Value of Benefits. DeterTnination of the value of benefits requires careful considerations,
including the following. First, a CCT program may require a built-in mechanism/procedure to
frequently adjust the value of benefits, taking into account the effect of inflation.
Second, the value of benefits needs to be attractive-enough for low-income households to
adopt and maintain positive behaviors, and at the same time, low enough for better-off
populations to refrain from making illicit solicitation of benefit payments.
Third, the benefit values may need to be differentiated depending on the attributes of
household members, the behaviors to be encouraged, and particular cultural as well as local
circumstances. For example, the out-of-pocket costs of attending schools would be higher for
older children. Therefore, "one-size fits all" benefit system may be over-kill for younger children
while being insufficient for older children. Likewise, where cultural biases exist against girls'
education, perhaps the program should provide a premium to those households that ensure girls'
school attendance. Where supply-side constraints exist, the program could also provide a
premium to compensate higher costs of accessing services. While differentiation of the value of
benefits may be desirable under certain circumstances, it also adds complexities to the program
management and could raise administrative overhead. Thus, upon consideration of a particular
scheme of differentiation, its advantages and disadvantages need to be carefully analyzed.
Fourth, the value of the benefit should have a strong relationship with the actual
out-of-pocket costs of schooling and health-care (including transportation, school books,
uniforms, etc.). Additionally, benefits should have some relevance to a poverty line, expressed as
a percentage of the local poverty line.
- 121 -



Taking into account these considerations as well as the available envelope of Government
and World Bank resources, the benefit levels have been set as follows:
* For education benefits, not to exceed $8 per child. Second and subsequent children will
recieve smaller benefits on a sliding scale. Payment will be made twice a term, or four times
during the 9 month academic year, totaling US $72 per year.
* For health benefits, $6 per child per month, payments to be made quarterly, totaling US $72
per year.
Form of Payment. A CCT program makes cash payments to its beneficiaries. One way
to do this is to wire money to the beneficiary's bank account. Concerns were raised with respect
to the accessibility of bank networks to rural households. Unfortunately, altemative forms of
payments--cash voucher, check, and food stamps--do not address the accessibility problem better
than wiring money through bank networks, and thus the Government of Turkey has decided that
CCT payments will be made through banks. Given that the members of rural households visit city
centers at least approximately once every month to go to markets, obtaining the cash at a bank
does not seem to be more burdensome than the alternatives.
At times, the question of whether to pay in cash is raised. However, vouchers or food
stamps do not keep recipients from misusing the benefit. Food stamps can be easily traded in the
secondary market, and would not deter the recipients from undesirable consumptions significantly
rnore effectively than cash.   Furthermore, these alternatives are more administratively
cumbersome and could be more costly, as they need to be printed and delivered. Consequently,
wire transfer appears to be the most preferable forrn of payment.
Cash as an Incentive. In many countries, the World Bank has asked the poor about their
preferences for assistance, and the overwhelming preference of the poor is to be helped with cash
payments, not food or other items in kind, because of the flexibility of cash. For CCT, it is
important that the benefit be paid in cash to serve as incentive to parents to send their children to
school. Sometimes, people are concerned about cash payments, since the recipients might spend
benefit payments for undesirable purposes like tobacco consumption.  It is important to
understand that if a poor recipient is going to spend on tobacco consumption, it is likely that such
a person will already have kept his child from school to save money for tobacco, and may even
have sent the child out to work in the informal sector.
Household Representative Authorized to Receive Benefit Payments. CCT programs
typically designate the mother as the person who is authorized to receive benefit payments on
behalf of the household. In many countries of Latin America and Africa, the payment is made to
the mother, not to the father, since research clearly shows that women are much more likely to
spend cash assistance on food or the needs of the children. While payment to the mother may be
difficult in some regions where the tradition is for the father to do the shopping in town and to
control finances, the principle of payment to mothers would also help to empower women there,
particularly the younger ones. Even if the mother simply handed the cash to her husband,
designating the mother as the household representatives would make meaningful impact on
household behaviors of, if not present generation, the next generation by officially recognizing the
- 122 -



important role of women. For such households without mothers, it is important to specify who
will receive the benefit payments on behalf of the household under what circumstances.
Payment Cycle. One of the design challenges of a CCT program is to define the payment
cycle, illustrated by the loop in the right side of Figure 1. Each of the steps represented by the
boxes, diamonds and arrows in the figure consists of a large number of sub-steps, each of which
needs to be defined very clearly.
In principle, the shorter the payment cycle is, the greater will be the CCT program's
impact on the behaviors of the beneficiaries. This is because the beneficiaries will see the linkage
between the cause (e.g. school attendance/non-attendance) and the effect (payment/non-payment)
more clearly.

Project Operational Manual.
The Bank requires the borrower to prepare a Project Operational Manual (POM) for the
project to be financed by a Bank investment loan. A POM is a major document, detailing, among
others: (i) management structure of project implementation; (ii) terms of reference of key
personnel; (iii) project implementation plan and time table (physical, financial and procurement);
(iv) operational procedures to be followed; (v) intemal and extemal reporting arrangements and
formats (including progress reports, financial reports, audit reports and procurement reports). It
is important to note that the Bank requires the borrower to follow Bank guidelines for
procurement and financial management. Any deviation from the guidelines need to be fully
described in the POM, and approved by the Bank's regional procurement advisor and the financial
management specialists before the loan becomes effective.

Additional
Annex 13
TURKEY: Social Risk Mitigation Project
Institutional Assessment
I. SYDTF
Background
The SYDTF was legally established in May 1986 under Law 3294. "The purpose of this
Act is to assist citizens in absolute poverty and need and (other)persons that have been admitted
to or have entered Turkey in any way, to ensure fair distribution of income by taking measures for
strengthening social justice, to promote private social assistance and solidarity" (Article 1,
amended 16 June, 1989).
The SYDTF is an extra budgetary fund, financed by earmarked taxes and administered by
a State Minister. It works in coordination with 931 regional SYDVs, which are responsible for
fulfilling all the requirements of the law in order to have funding resources to implement the
different services and activities benefiting the needy. The volume of funds transferred by SYDVs
is far greater than that under the Social Assistance for the Elderly and the Disabled (Law 2022).
Administrative Board
The SYDTF Board comprises a Prime Minister Undersecretary, an Interior Ministry
Undersecretary, a SB Undersecretary, General Director of SHCEK and the General Director of
SYDVs under the chairmanship of a State Minister appointed by the Prime Minister. All the
decisions made at Board meetings enter into effect after the ratification and approval by the Prime
Minister. The Board is the highest level to which applications for approval of Program Services
can be made; Investments, Scholarships, Social Assistance. Health Assistance to Green Card
holders does not require Board approval and is signed off by the Directors on behalf of the State
Minister.
Benefits in kind include: food, clothing, fuel, medicine and a variety of small productive
projects (greenhouses, fruit cultivation, bee-keeping, handicrafts, carpet weaving). The cash
benefits are grants and scholarship programs, and emergency related assistance.
The processes and procedures have been built up throughout the years in a non-systematic
way through short-term planning. The procedures for the appraisal of requests at the SYDTF are
essentially limited to checking the completeness of the required documents to present them to the
Board for revision and approval.
The decisions on project approval by the the Board are based on the assessment of
projects by staff whose expertise are in areas other than development or poverty alleviation. In
-125-



addition, there is insufficient technical criteria used for assessing projects, therefore the main
emphasis in proposal asssements is placed on the budget and availability of funding as the main
points of consideration. Therefore, there is a need for developing procedures and criteria for
proper assessments of proposals as well as extensive training of staff. Since the SYDTF does not
have its own budget for operational costs, it has very little opportunity for doing this.
In addition, since the SYDTF does not have its own budget for operational costs, if there
is a need for furniture, computers, etc. a request is presented by the Ankara SYDV to the SYDTF
Board for approval. Once the request is approved, the Ankara SYDV obtains the equipment and
then physically transfers it to the SYDTF central office.
SYDVs
The SYDVs have been established in provinces and districts as legal entities. The SYDV
Committee is chaired by the Governor of the provinces, and in the districts by the Kaymakam
(District Governor). The municipal mayor, the provincial head of finance, the provincial director of
social services, the health official and three private citizens make up the committee. Each SYDV is
independent and has freedom in the decision-making process for granting social assistance and for
income-generating sub-projects.
The process of granting an income-generating sub-project begins with the applicant's
filling out an application form and obtaining the necessary documentation. Next, the SYDV Board
considers the application and the members of the Board either approve or reject the requests at
their discretion. There is no unified systematic criteria to evaluate the requests for sub-projects by
the SYDVs. Afterwards the application forms are sent to the SYDTF where, according to the type
of requests, they are distributed among the different departments. The SYDTF departments
appraise the proposal based on the completeness of the documentation without any systematic
technical appraisal. The requests are then presented to the SYDV Board. Funds are transferred to
all the SYDVs on a monthly basis, at the start of the winter season for fuel, at the start of the
school year for education, and before the Ramadan holidays for foodstuffs and clothing.
Revenues of the SYDTF and SYDVs
According to Article 4 of Act no. 3294 the Fund's revenues consist of:
*  Amounts to be transferred from established funds or those to be established by laws and
decrees pursuant to a decree issued by the Council of Ministers provided that such
amounts shall not be higher than 10 percent of total funds thereof, less withholding of 40
percent by the Treasury (abolished).
*  An additional amount of 4 percent to be paid by taxpayers liable to pay income and
corporation income taxes, less withholding of 40 percent by the Treasury.
*  An amount corresponding to 5 percent of proceeds obtained from sale of forestry
properties (abolished).
*  50 percent of proceeds from traffic fines.
*  30 percent of proceeds obtained by the Turkish Radio and Television Organization (TRT)
- 126 -



from advertisements (abolished).
*  15 percent of proceeds obtained by the Radio Television High Council (RTUK) from
advertisements.
*  0.02 percent of proceeds from fuel oil consumption tax (abolished).
*  Funds to be allocated from the budget.
*  All kinds of donations.
*  Other revenues.
Allocation of Resources
The Board chaired by the State Minister meets on average 5 times a year, and all the
applications from the SYDVs, which have been sent to the SYDTF offices for revision and have
complete documentation, are considered for approval of funding. The process established under
Law 3294 gives total discretionary power first to the regional authorities and then to the Board.
Resources are allocated regionally at the beginning of each year on the basis of population and
socio-economic indicators. At the present moment there is no systematic methodology for
targeting and allocation of resources, to ensure that the most needy will be the final beneficiaries.
Two key problems are:
*  The absence of well established selection criteria and a centralized database, such as an
MIS, allow for an individual to receive duplicative support from the SYDTF; and
* The lack of a M&E system to measure impact and improve procedures.
Disbursements
The current budget is supported by an off-budget mechanism which gives the SYDTF
flexibility for the allocation of resources according to its components. The resources are
transferred on a monthly basis to the 931 regional SYDVs for their regular activities through the
state banking system according to the formula in Annex 6. The Resources Department is limited
to processing the disbursements to the SYDVs. It does not have authority to supervise and audit
the final payments to the beneficiaries.
All the requests presented in the official forms are supported by basic documentation,
(letters) which describe the problem that will be solved if the money is granted. In some cases
(productive projects), it is stated that the amount of money received should be paid back in cash,
but no monitoring is undertaken by the SYDTF to check if this money is ever repaid.
Targeting
The Law defines the targeted group of citizens as those who are poor and in need of help,
who are not connected to the Social Security System, and who can become productive if helped
with education and training. SYDVs apply individual criteria, not consistent with one another,
based on their knowledge of the inhabitants of the province or district. Exclusive reliance on local
knowledge leaves open the scope for criticism of favoritism. There is an obvious need to have a
systematized targeting methodology to limit the discretion that the current procedures have.

Staff
Law 3294 restricts the SYDTF's functions essentially to a funding mechanism. The
SYDTF can only fund state organizations i.e. the 931 affiliated SYDVs. The SYDTF does not
have its own administrative capacity and most of its 67 staff members are seconded and paid from
other organizations.  A number of staff including the Directors are from the Prime Minister's
office, while other staff members are from Zirat and Halk Banks; MEB; SB; Ministries of Justice
and Finance; State Railways, and Airport and Ports;   General Director of SHCEK  and
Undersecretary of the Prime Ministry.

Training
It is not current SYDTF policy to have staff trained in a systematic way, and there is no
budget for training. The only training that SYDTF staff receive internally comes from the
computer specialist who prepares basic training for staff who do not have any computer skills.
The development of a training plan for the PCU and the SYDTF should be part of the yearly
SYDTF plan of activities in order to:
* Disseminate best practices, frameworks, and new knowledge
* Practice skills and receive professional feedback
* Network, share, reflect and encourage
* Be driven by ongoing feedback that is received and analyzed.
Procedures
The SYDTF has developed procedures and processes that are followed by memory, or
they are transferred from one staff to the next. There are no written procedures, nor technical
guides or manuals for new staff to learn from or for managers to revise and improve procedures.
Improvements in SYDTF operations and operations are suggested in the following areas:
e  Focus on the process of identification of needs and the means for addressing beneficiary
needs.
i  Network and share a database system of potential beneficiaries, with other government
and non- government organizations.
C Cross-check assistance to beneficiaries, how much, by whom, what criteria.
i Systematically monitor and evaluate assistance and impact.
o  Build organizational capacity at the beneficiary level through the creation of cooperative
and associations: Creation of capacity at the beneficiary level to move out of poverty and
create sustainable income generating opportunities.
* Extend the organization's abilities for outreach beyond urban and peri-urban areas.
* Avoid duplication of services among the various public and private sector social assistance
organizations.
*  Avoid abuse of system through better selection criteria, cross-checking, and monitoring
and evaluation.
*  Provide assistance based on a clear definition of the poor and a selection criteria set down
in the operations manual, and not based on the discretion of administrative and political
authorities.
*  The role of municipalities in social assistance should be expanded. Currently municipalities
have their own resources to provide social assistance, and do not have resources from
State social assistance programs.
Discussions with Government and social assistance organizations indicate that there is a
need to rationalize this assistance through definition of poverty, selection criteria, targeting,
monitoring and evaluation, financial management, mechanisms, coordination with other
organizations, and an avoidance of overlapping of functions and overlapping of assistance to the
- 130-



same beneficiaries.
II. SHCEK
Background
SHCEK is a General Directorate with budget and public legal entity, established under the
Law 2828 promulgated in 1983. It is the only public agency providing services to vulnerable
groups such as poor children, the young, the disabled, the aged and families in need of protection,
care and assistance.
Turkey has a long tradition of providing assistance to those in need. During the Ottoman
era, social assistance organisations were founded to protect the rights of the widows and orphans
and to ensure the subsistence of other people in need of assistance. The most important among
such organisations were the foundations (Vakiflar). The Vakiflars had a significant social impact
during the Ottoman era and provided assistance to the economic and socially disadvantaged.
Such people in need were provided with food, shelter, clothing and education. Hospitals,
orphanages, soup houses, religious institutions and care houses were established by Vakfilars.
On June 15th, 1921, the social assistance commission of the Grand National Assembly
was founded. After the foundation of Republic the social services were generally performed by
public institutions and agencies. The Civil Law promulgated in 1926 set forth regulations
affecting the social services for children. At least 9 laws affecting the social services for children
have been promulgated since then;
*  In 1949, the first law on "Children in Need of Protection" was promulgated.
*  In 1957, the 1949 law was annulled and the second law on "Children in Need of
Protection" was promulgated.
e  In 1959, the law number 7355 on the "Establishment of Social Services Institute" was
adopted. That law was based on the need for the training of social services professionals in
social services schools.
*  In 1963 "Social Services General Directorate" was founded within the Ministry of Health
and Social Services pursuant to the Law number 225.
*  New constitution of Turkish Republic adopted in 1982 included detailed provisions on
social services, and resulted in the promulgation of the Social Services and Child
Protection Agency Law in 1983.
*  In 1988, the additional Law number 3413 was promulgated as an addition to the Social
Services and Child Protection Agency Law to provide employment opportunities for the
children having left training institutions after reaching 18 years of age, in public agencies
and institutions. The Prime Ministry instead of the Ministry of Health and Social Services
was designated as in charge of Social Services.
SHCEK is responsible for providing service to the aged, the disabled, the women and all
individuals of the society who need protection and support. SHCEK currently provides 24 hours
service to more than 30,000 infants, children, young people, the aged and the disabled; and more
- 131 -



than 75,000 citizens during daytime with its 364 social service facilite (97 Training Institutions, 77
Children's Homes, 50 Rest Homes for the Aged, 48 Care and Rehabilitation Centres, 36
Community Centres, 16 Nurseries and Daycare Centres, 6 Mutual Support Centres for the Aged,
7 Shelters for Women, 7 Youth Homes, 16 Children and Youth Centres and 1 Adult Counselling
Center).
Services For Children and Families
Children and Young People in Need of Protection: According to the SHCEK Law 2828,
the children in need of protection are defined as the children whose physical, spiritual or moral
development or personal security is in danger; who do not have a father or a mother or neither; or
whose parents are not known; or have been abandoned, neglected or abused by their parents; or
whose parents are in prison. SHCEK is designated as responsible for executing the services for
such children. However, SHCEK faces difficulties in providing such services especially during the
periods of crisis when national incomes deteriorate more. This problem becomes even more
severe due to the fact that approximately 35 percent of the population is not included in social
insurance programs, that there is high unemployment and the social services and social assistance
programs do not cover a sufficient number of people.
SHCEK generally provides care services only to the children in need of protection for
whom it is not possible to live with their own families or a foster family and who cannot be
adopted. Among the 18,000 children under the care of SHCEK, 5.5 percent are abandoned
children and another 7.2 percent are those whose parents died. The majority (87.3 percent)
however do have a living parent who is still in contact. SHCEK provided services to the children
in need of protection and families through aid in cash and in kind, children's homes, training
institutions, foster family and adoption service and children and youth centres for street children.
In 2001, 7 Children's Homes and 5 Training institutions are planned to be opened.
Since healthy development of the children under protection can be ensured in institutions
where one-to-one relations can be established and which are organised in a manner similar to the
family environment, the works concerning furnishing the existing children's homes in a manner
similar to family environment will be continued and the new institutions will be constructed and
furnished with lower capacities. The young people who are under protection in the SHCEK's
institutions and who are enrolled in the last year of high school or who have graduated from high
school are sent to University Entrance Examination Preparation Courses to prepare for the
university entrance test and to improve their performance.
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child: SCHEK is responsible for monitoring and
coordinating the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which became a
national legal instrument after being published in the Official Gazette in 1995.
Adoption Services Adoption services occupy an important place among the models of
services provided to the children in need of protection. A person must be a minimum of 35 years
of age and must have no children in order to be able to adopt a child. In accordance with article
21 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the child is allowed to benefit from adoption
- 132 -



services in accordance with the prime interests of the child. The children under the care and
protection of the SHCEK, who are suitable for adoption, are adopted by the parents whose
applications are accepted by the court verdict after the investigation carried out by the social
workers. Since the adoption requests involve mainly healthy children of 0-1 age group, about 450
children meeting these criteria are adopted every year.
Foster Family Services Foster family services are executed by the Provincial Social
Services Directorates. The best place for the care and protection of the children is a family
environment. In Westem societies, 75 percent of the children in need of protection are cared by
foster families. In Turkey, on the other hand, this rate has not reached even to 2 percent despite
all efforts. There have been various attempts to develop and improve the efficiency of foster
family services. The number of children cared by foster families is 395 as of the end of 1999,
while 93 more children were placed with foster families during the first nine months of 2000.
Currently 470 children are under care of foster families of which 110 of those children are cared
by volunteering families while 370 are cared for a fee. All of the applicants were contacted by
mail or by social work experts in three months' period. However, it has been understood that this
sensitivity was caused by the earthquake and the families wanted to adopt or care for children
who had experienced the earthquake, but not other children. The families applying to serve as
foster families are paid a monthly amount of TL 35 - 80 million, depending on the age and
education of the child. The sums paid for disabled children are increased by two times depending
on the disability and age of the child. In addition, education and medical expenses and allowances
of the children cared by foster families are paid by SHCEK.
Street Children/ Working Children: In recent years, the number of children living and
working in the streets has been observed to increase quickly. The causes which force children to
live and work in the streets are economic and social factors such as rapid and uneven urbanisation,
increasing squatter development, inequality in income distribution, migration form the rural areas
to the cities, etc. For this purpose, children and their families are provided with guidance,
counseling, training and rehabilitation services by the Children and Youth Directorates as an
attempt to solve the problems of children that live and work in the streets.
The identity details, educational conditions, working conditions of the children and their
reasons to live and work in the street are investigated through the "Street Studies" conducted by
the professionals working at the Children and Youth Centres and the children are encouraged to
visit the centres. The families who are contacted during the street studies are informed about the
dangers of the streets for the children and told that it is a crime to force the children to work.
The professionals working at the centers conduct personal studies concerning the
psychosocial, educational and family conditions of each child. The families who force their
children to work in the streets because of economic deprivation are examined social assistnace
food, clothing, stationary are provided to the families within the scope of social assistance, the
psycho-social development of the child and the necessity of play, education and social activities
are emphasized and the families are encouraged to send their children to these centres. Providing
therapy to the children with health problems and performing medical care against the risk of
contagious diseases posed by the streets are among other services supplied.

The efforts to contribute to the solution of the problem of children living/working in the
streets are continuing in Bursa, Batman, Van and Malatya. The Istanbul Ayvansaray Children and
Youth Centre provides day service to working children; 20 Children and Youth Centres are
planned to be in service by the end of 2001.  Centers with specialized staff and technical
equipment are planned to be established or children with problems such as drug addiction,
prostitution or children running away from home for the first time. The scope of the studies
oriented towards the problem group and their families are planned to be expanded and the studies
conducted together with the families are planned to be focused on. Job and professional
qualification programs are intended to support the families who force their children to work in the
street for economic reasons.
Nursery and Daycare Centre Services: A total of 1,252 children benefit from the services
of 16 Nursery and Daycare Centers were the children of working parents are cared. In 2000, 5
nurseries were closed because of working under-capacity for a long time.
Supporting the Youth in Society: Public agencies and institutions are obliged to allocate
one per thousand of the existing vacant posts every year to the children under the care and
protection of SHCEK. As of October 2000, the number of children placed at jobs was 1,826,
with 4,552 children are waiting to be placed in employment.
Women's Shelters: Women's Guesthouses have assumed significant functions in reaching
the target of preventing and gradually eliminating violence against women. In the Women's
Shelters, professional studies are conducted to examine the situations of women, their
disagreements with their families or spouses and solutions for their problems. Such efforts
include providing the psychological support, counselling, legal guidance, taking measures to help
them to be self-sufficient, prepare them have a job preventing the recurrence of violence, ensuring
healthy family relationships for their children to grow up in, and monitoring their conditions. A
total of 2,414 women and 2,083 children have benefited from the services of the Women's
Shelters from their first opening to September 2000, and 390 women have been placed in
employment. Work is ongoing to open a new women's Shelters in Istanbul. This would provide
services to additional 500 women and 300 children in 2001.
Protection and Preventive Services
Community Centers: The General Directorate, in addition to institutional services, since
1993 operates Community Centers which provide protective, preventive, therapeutic and
rehabilitative services. Community Centers are institutions aimed primarily for disadvantage
regions. As of October 2000, there were 24 Community Centres in gecekondus and 12 in South
and Eastern Anatolian cities, now there is atotal of 44. As of October 2000, 75.000 women,
young people and children have benefited from the services of the Community Centers. The
Community Centers aim to increase the rate of literacy, increasing the participation in education
process at every level, develop productive skills especially among women, provide opportunities
of employment to generate more income, increase the consciousness of the society to act in an
organised manner, reduce the domestic work load of the women, and rising the status of women
- 134 -



through programs to develop their knowledge and skills in various fields.
The Early Childhood Support Project, which was commenced in the 1990s and continued
in 2000, was implemented among the groups of 15 children in primary schools. During this
program which was implemented on half-day basis, food was distributed to the children every day
and aid in kind (clothing, educational stationery, etc.) were provided to the children and families.
The program was implemented in 13 provinces, namely in Istanbul and Izmir, Igdir, Diyarbakir,
Batman, Agri, Siirt, Sirnak, Bingol, Mus, Van, Hakkari and Mardin in Eastern and South-Eastern
Anatolia for 10,000 children.
Aid in Kind and in Cash Services: In recent years, the services of aid in kind and in
cash which are protective-preventive and supportive in nature have gained gradually more
importance among the service policies of the General Directorate of SHCEK. On the other hand,
the services of aid in kind and in cash by the SHCEK lead to more efficient service with fewer
resources, which enable the individuals to continue their lives within their own family union.
The following groups are given priority in benefiting from the services of aid in kind and in
cash: (a) children placed under protection and cared by the SHCEK, but who can be cared by
their own families if economic support is provided; (b) children who are chosen for protection and
to be placed at the SHCEK due to the economic poverty of their families; (c) disabled children
and young people under the care of their families due to the lack of sufficient institutional support;
and (d) children for whom a protection order is requested due to the economic poverty of their
families.
Services for the Disabled
SHCEK has started serious attempts to provide solutions to the problems of disabled
individuals, to ensure care and rehabilitation by developing and implementing modern models. The
aim is to and dispersing the rehabilitation services to ensure that the disabled can live productive
and independent lives in the society. Successful initiatives are continued to make the disabled
individuals under protection happy and productive through activities including toy workshops,
greenhouses, mushroom cultivation, ceramics, packaging industry, agricultural rehabilitation and
animal husbandry. SHCEK provides services to the disabled citizens including therapy, care and
rehabilitation, training for the families of the disabled individuals, guidance and counselling,
institutional counselling and social aid.
The SHCEK provides services to the disabled in 51 day and night rehabilitation centres.
The 3,318 disabled individuals benefited as of September 2000. An "Independent Living Home"
project was implemented for the disabled individuals, who have achieved basic living skills,
sufficiently equipped for independent life and gained professional qualifications through the
rehabilitation programs provided by the centers. Within the scope of "Independent Living Home"
project, an "Independent Living Unit" was established in 1999 for the disabled individuals under
care in the Saray Rehabilitation Centre (Ankara), who have developed self-care skills.

Services for the Aged
Approximately 7.1 percent of Turkey's population is over 60 years old. This group
expected to exceed 15 percent of the population by 2010. Since the importance of the services
to be provided to the aged increases. SHCEK provides the aged with nursing homes. The
number of nursing homes for the aged is 50 as of October 2000 and the total capacity is 5,397.
IV. The Health System in Turkey
Health services in the public sector in Turkey are mainly provided by the Ministry of
Health (SB), the social insurance institution, known as the Sosyal Sigortalar Kurumu (SSK), and
the University hospitals. Other ministries (like Defense, Education, and Transport), local
governments and some state economic enterprises also provide health services, but their capacity
is quite limited.
The SB is the sole provider ofpreventive services, provided in health centers, health posts,
mother and child health and family planning centers, tuberculosis dispensaries, malaria and cancer
control centers. In addition, the SB implements several special preventive health programs that
provide reproductive health services, family planning services, public health education,
immunization, control of diarrheal diseases, control of acute respiratory infections, etc. The SB is
the major provider of maternal health care services, provided through health posts, health
centers and hospitals. All preventive and first contact services provided by the SB are free of
charge to all users. The SB also provides laboratory based preventive services through the Refik
Saydam Hygiene Center.
The private sector consists mostly of public physicians who are allowed to work in their
private practices in the afternoons and provide a significant share of outpatient care. Though
exact data is not available, the private sector appears to be an important source of care in large
urban areas and in the Western part of the country.
Health Coverage
The population can be divided into two main groups: people who have some sort of health
coverage, comprising about 87 percent of the total population, and people who do not have any
sort of health coverage, comprising the remaining 13 percent (i.e. 7.5 million). Those who have
any sort of coverage can be categorized as: (i) White-collar worker (civil servants and their
dependents, members of Emekli Sandigi); (ii) Blue-collar workers (members of Social Security
Agency); (iii) Self-employed entrepreneurs and small artisans (members of Bag-Kur); and (iv)
those of the rural and urban poor covered by the Green Card scheme.
This leaves a big subgroup comprising over 13 percent of Turkey's population that is not
covered either by any health insurance program or by the Green Card program. There is a
provision under Code 3294: Law on Incentive to Social Aid and Solidarity Fund under which the
state can pay for health expenditures of those are not insured, are unable to get a green card and
- 136 -



cannot afford to pay for their health care, but the allocations and use of the SYDTF resources is
far from adequate to address the healthcare needs of this population. Enacted under Law 3816 of
1992, the Green Card Program provides free health care services to its beneficiaries. Managed by
the SB and financed via general taxes, the Green Card program is seen as a transitional solution
that would prevail until the General Health Insurance System is brought into application. To
qualify for the Green Card, an individual should be a Turkish citizen, not be covered by any social
security system, and have a monthly income of less than one-third of the minimum wage amount
(excluding taxes and social security premiums) as determined by Code 1475. Clearly, there is a
pressing need for some insurance system that will expand coverage and extend health care to 8.6
million people who are not eligible for obtaining Green Card.
Effect of the Crisis to Utilization of Health Services
It is a common belief that the current crisis did not affect utilization of health services and
that it remains low for poor and those that do not have health insurance. However, it is expected
that if crisis persists, long term effects will especially affect utilization of both preventive and
curative services by the poor.
Registration and Reliability of Health Data
Government continues to rely on the existing reported data for utilization of services as
well as for immunization coverage. In general, the reported data do not include children that are
not registered and therefore actual figures do not always correspond with reported figures. In
addition, there are no data on utilization of services and immunization coverage per different
socio-economic groups which would enable better targeting.  These issues are being covered
under the socio-economic survey in preparation for the SRMP and an immunization study under
the Bank-assisted Health II project.
According to some reports, there is a significant number of children under five whose
births are not registered with authorities. Opinions for magnitude of this problem are divided.
Issue of non registration might have effect on estimating number of beneficiaries, calculating
coverage rates, planning services and setting priorities.
Suggestions For Effective Implementation of CCT
To date, much effort has been made to strengthen supply side of provision of health
services. Health education and health promotion activities had important but also limited impact
to creating demand for preventive health services.  It is highly recommended by SB that
information campaign on the availability of CCT should be combined with health promotion and
health education programs. SB believes that in addition to incentives created by conditional cash
transfers, the awareness of benefit of preventive health services are more important in the long run
and would complement strengthening the demand.
Verification process for compliance with conditionalities has to be transparent and
auditable to prevent false certification and abuse of the system. Experience from other countries
- 137 -



shows that introduction of individual health cards was an effective way to preserve data on
immunization, growth monitoring and prenatal care.  The introduction and procedure of
distribution of individual health cards has to be defined in such way to avoid duplication and
potential abuse but also to be affordable and to be accessible for poor. In addition to introducing
individual health cards on auditable register of visits to health centers for each individual with
description of services provided should be established. Those changes and introduction of
individual health cards, and register would require additional training for health staff both in
administrative issues related to implementation of this program but also in explaining the set of
criteria that would be established as conditionalities.
Regardless of the fact that criteria for obtaining the green card appear to be fairly well
defined to target the poor, the process of registration, issue of land and property ownership and
lack of verification system, etc. seems to contribute to wide abuse of this system. Therefore,
eligibility for Green Card appears be inappropriate for targeting criteria for CCT.
