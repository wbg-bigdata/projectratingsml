APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN IRELAND
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Despite considerable improvements over the past ten years, the
Irish education system is ill suited to the development needs of the country,
both in qualitative and quantitative terms. An over-emphasis on academic
subjects has resulted in a lack of trained manpower in both agriculture and
industry, placing Ireland in an unfavorable competitive position in relation
to most of the rest of Western Europe.
ii.       Secondary level education is now undergoing a significant change
from a system of small, academically-oriented private boys' or girls' schools
(generally owned and operated by religious orders) to a system of comprehen-
sive, coeducational schools, incorporating pre-vocational training with
academic courses. While the government is the main source of funds for the
private religious schools, the Department of Education did not play a role
in the operation of these schools or in the formulation of their syllabi or
curricula. The new comprehensive schools, fully financed by the government,
are managed by boards consisting of representatives of the religious orders,
and local and state authorities. This permits government guidance and flex-
ibility in programming, and assures the inclusion of pre-vocational courses
in the curriculum. At present, there are four such comprehensive schools in
operation; the proposed project would add twenty-four more, replacing forty-
six inadequate private schools.
iii.      In line with the growth and reorientation of the economy, manpower
needs in Ireland are shifting from traditional farming to commercial agri-
culture and to industrialization. The possible entry of Ireland into the
European Economic Community presents new challenges as well as new opportun-
ities. This requires better-trained workers in all fields, especially in
technical and managerial occupations. To help meet the demand of techni-
cians and craftsmen, pre-vocational courses and the strengthening and
expansion of secondary and post-secondary technical education are needed.
Nine technical schools and colleges are either in operation or under con-
struction, and the proposed project would add three more to aid in filling
the growing manpower gap in this area. The output of the three project
technical institutions from 1977-1980 would fill about 50% of the estimated
shortage of skilled workers and middle level technicians in 1980 and about
15% of the shortage of higher technicians and business graduates. In an ef-
fort to keep farmers abreast of rapid changes in farming, county agricultur-
al extension services have been developed. Extension staff visit farms and
hold special training courses throughout the country. A network of twenty
agricultural education centers has already been set up; the project would
provide an additional thirty. The fifty centers would offer management
courses for practicing farmers and introductory courses to school leavers.
iv.       The project would thus consist of:  (a) twenty-four comprehensive
schools; (b) three technical institutions; (c) thirty agricultural educa-
tion centers; and (d) two man/years of technical assistance.



- ii -
v.        The construction of twenty-four comprehensive schools would permit
standardized schedules of accommodations. Technical assistance would be
provided to assist in the development of a systems approach to design and
building, and to introduce the use of industrialized building components.
Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment would be awarded on the
basis of the Bank's guidelines for international competitive bidding.
vi.       A Project Unit, within the Department of Education, is being es-
tablished to supervise the project's implementation, to coordinate activi-
ties within the government and with private bodies, and to provide liaison
with the Bank.
vii.      The total project cost is estimated at US$ 33.0 million and the
foreign exchange component at US$13.0 million. The project is suitable as
a basis for a Bank Loan to Ireland of US$13.0 million, for a term of 20
years including a grace period of 5 years. The Loan, which would finance
foreign exchange costs, would be equivalent to about 40% of the estimated
project cost.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Bank mission visited Ireland in March 1970, to identify educa-
tion projects suitable for Bank financing. The findings were discussed
with the government by a second Bank mission in May 1970, which also advised
the government on the preparation of the project. The government subse-
quently prepared the project and in August 1970 requested Bank assistance
for:
(i) reform and consolidation of general secondary
and vocational education;
(ii)  expansion of secondary level technical and
agricultural education; and
(iii) expansion of higher level technician and
commerce education.
The proposed project was appraised in November/December, 1970, by a mission
comprising Messrs. 0. Markgren (general educator), R. Byron (technical
educator), A. de Capitani (economist), G. Gayle (agricultural educator),
and R. Welter (architect-consultant). The mission was assisted in the field
by Messrs. O.H. Calika and K. Thint.
1.02      The proposed project was slightly modified during appraisal; 29
comprehensive schools were reduced to 24 of larger size. Technical assis-
tance also was added to: (i) introduce a systems approach to design and
building in order to reduce costs; and (ii) integrate use of prefabricated
or industrialized elements in the project schools.
1.03      The project, as modified, would consist of:
A.   Construction of and equipment for
- twenty-four comprehensive schools
- one regional technical college
- one secondary technical school
- one college of commerce
- thirty agricultural education centers
B.   Two man/years of technical assistance in the field of:
- educational facility planning
- construction systems development
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$33.0 million and the for-
eign exchange component at US$13.0 million.

II.  TEI  SETTING
Physical Environment and Population
2.01      Ireland extends over 27,136 square miles.  The center of the is-
land consists of an extensive fertile lowland, ringed almost completely by
coastal highlands, which provide difficult agricultural conditions. Com-
pared with most European countries, Ireland is poorly endowed with mineral
resources. Due to the Gulf stream, the climate is mild, but frequent and
irregular rains make the ripening of grain crops difficult. More than 50%
of total land area is under pasture.
2.02      The population of Ireland is estimated at 2.93 million.  It is now
growing at 0.4% p.a., still well below the rate of natural increase (1.0%
p.a.) due to a declining but still heavy rate of net emigration (0.6% p.a.).
This decline in the rate of emigration, which dates back to the beginning of
the 1960's, is expected to gain momentum during the 1970's. By 1980, the
population should reach 3.2 million, still only half as much as in 1841.
2.03      Because of the slow population growth and the concentration of
emigration in the age group 15-34, Ireland's age structure shows an unusual
combination of fairly high levels of both young and old dependency (42.4%
in 1966). Since 1961, the active population (1.7 million in 1970) has in-
creased at the same rate as total population. As a result, the ratio of
those in the active age group (15-64) to those in the dependent age group
has remained constant at 1:0.72 and is the most unfavorable in Europe.
2.04      The urban population represents 51.7% of the total and has been
growing at 1.5% p.a. It is mainly concentrated in Dublin (750,000 inhabi-
tants), Cork (125,000), and Limerick (60,000); no major town is located in
the northwestern quadrant of the country. The rural population is widely
scattered; the density being hiigher - despite heavy migration - where the
agricultural land is poor. As a result, since land ownership is widely
distributed, the agricultural holdings tend to be smaller in the least
fertile areas.
2.05      The high dependency rate and the dispersion of rural population,
historically, have had unfavorable welfare implications, making it diffi-
cult to provide adequate healtlh, educational and other social facilities
for the entire population. As a result, the general level of education,
despite considerable improvements over the past decade, is still rather
low by European standards. Out of 1.9 million adults (1966 census), about
1.2 million (63.2%) had only primary education, and only 73,189 (3.9%)
attended post-secondary institutions.  While the percentage of "functional
illiteracy" among the adult population is estimated at only about 10%, the
leveL of education in some major occupational groups is quite poor. In
agriculture, 86.9% of men and 77.3X of women have had no more than primary
schooling.



-3-
The Economy
2.06      The growth of GNP in real terms has averaged 4.1% p.a. from 1958
to 1969.  In 1969, the GNP per capita at factor cost was L 424 ($1,018).
The rapid growth of exports, the availability of relatively cheap manpower,
substantial foreign investments and a successful "mix" of fiscal and monetary
policies have provided the framework for the expansion. The process of
growth has not lessened and, in some cases, has tended to increase the income
differentials between agriculture and other sectors and among different regions
of the country.
2.07      The industrial sector (37.2% of GDP and 28.4% of employment in
1968) has been the most dynamic in recent years, growing at 7.0% p.a. since
the beginning of the 1960's and providing some 60,000 new jobs. It is
mainly concentrated in consumer goods production and light industries, and
depends heavily on imports of raw materials and capital goods. The limited
size of the domestic market, shortage of development funds, uneven quality
of management and increasing shortages of high level manpower (partially
due to the free entry of labor to the British market) are the major con-
straints. The distribution of new industries by regions shows a marked
concentration in a few "growth centers" (Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Limerick,
Galway).
2.08      Agriculture still produces about 22% of GDP, employs some
30% of the labor force (40% of men at work) and contributes about one-half
of exports. Four-fifths of the gross agricultural product consists of
livestock and livestock products, the balance being farm crops and peat.
The dominant pattern is one of small holdings, more than half of which are
below the minimum size (40 acres) that is considered profitable under Irish
conditions.
2.09      The service sector (41.2% of GDP and 42.2% of employment in 1968)
has been growing at 3.3% p.a. since 1958, providing some 70,000 new jobs
during the period. Tourism has led the expansion and now accounts for
about one-sixth of total foreign current earnings.
Economic Development Strategy
2.10      The objectives of the first two economic programs, (1959-1963, and
1964-1968), were to increase efficiency in agriculture and industry, to set
in motion an export-based industrial growth, to create new employment oppor-
tunities for labor leaving the land and to reduce unemployment and net emi-
gration.
2.11      A continued export-led industrial growth, further diversification
of the economy and more balanced regional development remain basic objec-
tives of the economic development strategy under the Third Program (1968-
1972). The main aim is to strengthen the social and economic structure of
the country in view of a possible future integration with the European
Economic Community (EEC).



- 4 -
2.12      Over the period 1970-1980, CDP is expected to grow at 4.1% p.a.,
on the basis of 6.5% increase in industry, 2.7% in services and 2.0% in
agriculture. Manpower will have to be provided with the skills and quali-
fications required in a growing economy and in a rapidly changing tech-
nological environment. In terms of educational strategy, this implies a
need for a more scientifically and practically oriented general education
and for a greater emphasis on vocational and technical training.
Manpower Requirements (Appendix III)
2.13      Total employment has been growing at 0.4% p.a. since 1965 and
is expected to increase at 0.6% p.a. from 1970 to 1980. High and middle-
level manpower requirements are expected to grow at 2.6% and 2.0%, respec-
tively. The following table shows, for some major occupational groups,
the level of employment in 1970 and the projected manpower requirements for
1980 (the projection is derived from a wider exercise carried out by the
Manpower Forecasting Unit in the Department of Labor; the methodology is
discussed in Appendix III).

2.14      A comparison of the corresponding educational requirements and the
projected educational outflows into the labor market (Appendix III) is as
follows:

Other 3rd Level                      30,000                  19,000
2.15      While the projected supply of university graduates is clearly
beyond the absorptive capacities of the labor market (as they appear now),
the general secondary school is expected to meet at least quantitatively
the increased demand, except at the senior secondary level. Shortages of
technicians and skilled workers have already emerged in several industries
and are expected to increase in the future; the likely deficit for 1980 is
estimated at 7,000. Even more acute is the expected shortage (11,000) of
business graduates and third-level technicians (engineering, electronics,
mechanics, construction); the possibilities of substitution are limited by
the low percentage of university students enrolled in technical fields.
2.16      In agriculture, the modernization and reorganization of production,
distribution and processing have already resulted in a decreasing need for
unskilled labor. The projected acceleration of the rate of rural migration
(about 65,000 workers during the decade 1970-1980) would reduce the level
of "disguised unemployment" and help increase the labor productivity in
that sector. However, given the growing requirements of technology and
management, an upgrading of the level of farmers education is a prere-
quisite for increasing farming efficiency and raising the standard of
living of the rural population.
The Education and Training System (Appendix I; Annexes 1 & 2; Charts 1-4)
2.17      Education is free and compulsory between the ages of 6-14.  The
education system consists of (i) a six-year primary course normally begin-
ning at the age of six, (ii) a secondary course comprising a three-year
junior and a two-year senior cycle, and (iii) third level courses of two
to seven years duration at universities and other institutions. Most prim-
ary schools have kindergarten classes for 1-2 years.
2.18      Primary school enrollment was 383,000 in 1968/69, with 95% in
government-aided schools.  The total enrollment as percent of the age group
6-11 years was 106.8% (Appendix I, para. 5). In addition, about 125,000
students were enrolled in voluntary kindergarten classes for the age group
4-5. The primary school system is educationally well developed; about 10%
of primary enrollments received remedial teaching for slow learners and
5,300 students were enrolled in special classes for retarded children.
Curriculum is currently undergoing reform. Of about 11,000 teachers in the
primary schools in 1968/69, 90% was qualified. Two-year teacher training



- 6 -
is offered in six colleges, but a proposal for extension to three-year
courses is under consideration.
2.19      Secondary school enrollments increased by 11% annually from 1965/
66, and reached 185,000 in 1968/69 or 69.6% of the age group 12-16. Enroll-
ments in non-aided schools accounted for 1.1% of total enrollments. Educa-
tion has been free since 1968, and bus services for aided schools are paid
for by the government. Some 17.5% of the age group 12-16 was enrolled in
vocational schools or continuation schools offering pre-vocational or tech-
nical education. During the last years seven regional colleges have been
added to the system offering courses in industrial, commercial and service
fields at both secondary and higher levels; they have a planned total ca-
pacity of 8,000 students. Agricultural education is offered in 13 colleges
with a total enrollment of 700.
2.20      The government has recognized the need for reform of general
secondary education. The curriculum is traditional and academically orien-
ted towards university entrance. The general secondary level is within the
domain of religious orders, which often use outmoded school buildings and
other inadequate facilities lacking equipment for teaching science and prac-
tical subjects. The average size of these schools is about 200 students,
separated into schools for boys and girls. A pilot program comprising four
coeducational, comprehensive schools, each with 500-600 students, was start-
ed in 1966 to reform and modernize general education and to coordinate edu-
cation efforts made by the government, local authorities and religious orders.
The schools have a broad diversified curriculum, including academic and
practical subjects, and offer counselling and guidance services. They have
proven to be successful.
2.21      About 80% of the total secondary staff of 10,800 teachers in
1968/69 was qualified. However, the teacher training programs, which need
reform, are under review (Appendix 1, para. 26).
2.22      Higher education is in great demand and, in 1968/69, third level
institutions enrolled 22,200 students representing 7.2% of the age group
17-23. Between 1965 and 1968, enrollments increased by 6.6% per year;
12% was enrolled in technical fields; one-third were girls.  Enrollments
for 1980 are projected to be 38,200 students, or an annual growth of about
5%. Aware of the need for a reorientation and coordination of efforts in
higher education, the government has appointed a Higher Education Author-
ity to advise the Minister of Education on the development of higher educa-
tion.
Education Development Strategy
2.23      The overall education strategy of Ireland is to promote greater
efficiency and productivity of the system and a better distribution of
educational opportunities through:



- 7 -
(i) meeting the needs of the individual to make him an effective
participant in the development of the country;
(ii)  coordination of all education efforts in the country;
(iii) efficient use of capital investments and recurrent
expenditures in education;
(iv)  adapting the school system to a changing society and to
provide the trained manpower required for possible future
participation in the EEC; and
(v) making education at all levels comparable with that of
other West European countries.
2.24      Implementation of the above strategy, under discussion in the
1960's, has started. Primary education efficiency is being increased by
the continuous concentration of schools, construction of larger institutions
and introduction of school bus services. The period of compulsory schooling
will be extended gradually from six to nine years, beginning in certain
counties in 1972, as more secondary schools become available.
2.25      The major objective of the general secondary education reform
fs to ma'-e stw ente  more nnri-A1'  to qiihqqiiPnt studies and to further
training and employment needs. The management of the comprehensive schools
is planned to include government, religious and local interests to achieve
a coordinated and common effort. A Development Branch in the Department of
Education has been established and has gained considerable experience from
the four pilot comprehensive schools built in 1966. The 24 comprehensive
schools forming part of the project would assist the country in its efforts
to reform and consolidate general secondary education. The School Building
Unit in the Department of Education is introducing more efficient school
sizes and construction methods, the use of designs suitable for modern
teaching methods and teacher time-saving equipment.
2.26      The policy for agricultural development is designed to modernize
the sector, reorganize the agricultural pattern and increase farming effi-
ciency. The goals are also to help to decrease emigration and the influx
to urban areas by improving income and the standard of living for farm fa-
milies and the 4,000 persons annually entering agriculture. As education
is essential to the attainment of these goals, the government is anxious
to increase the training facilities for agriculture at all levels. Propo-
sals, for ti) relocation of the Faculty of Agriculture with improved fa-
cilities and revised curricula; (ii) increasing the output of intermediate
level agricultural technicians, and (iii) expanding the teaching of agricul-
ture in secondary schools are being reviewed by the government. The proposed
Bank project would assist in meeting the immediate need for farmer education.



- 8 -
2.27       Expansion and reorientation of technical education is needed to
meet internal structural change and international competition. The present
system of alternative work and study (day and block release) programs for
basic training is gradually being replaced with a network of regional
secondary and post-secondary level technical colleges offering non-degree
programs. In addition, the government expects to retrain and upgrade the
labor force in special training centers operated by the Industrial Training
Authority. More participation by industry in curriculum design and adaptation
of education objectives to the needs of industry also is being introduced.
The three technical institutions included in the proposed Bank project would
help to develop a training system with objectives, standards of qualification
and capacity suited to the Irish economy.
Education Finances (Appendix II; Annexes 3, 4 and 5)
2.28       Financial responsibility for education rests primarily with the
central government, but local authorities contribute to the financing of
vocational education. Public expenditure on education increased from
I17.6 million in 1958/59 to 170.3 million in 1969/70, or by 13.4% per
year - much faster than the growth of total public expenditure and GNP.
In 1969/70 public expenditure on education accounted for 4.9% of GNP,
which is comparable to other European countries at the same stage of
development.
2.29       Capital expenditures on education increased from 11.4 million in
1958/59 to 112.6 million in 1969/70, or from 3.7% to 7.9% of total capital
expenditures. Because of a heavy concentration of education investments in
recent years (especially at the secondary level), the ratio of capital to
total expenditure has increased sharply, from 7.9% in 1958/59 to 17.9% in
1969/70.
2.30       Recurrent expenditures on education have grown at 12.2% p.a. since
1958, much faster than total enrollments. Price inflation, increases in
teachers' salaries and the shift in the composition of total student popu-
lation brought about by the faster growth of enrollments in the more expen-
sive secondary schools were major factors. Moreover, under the Free
Education Scheme (1967) and other recent legislation, both the number of
students who benefit from the program and the average amount of grants per
student have increased substantially. In 1969/70, recurrent expenditures on
education accounted for about 12% of current revenues, which is still a
relatively low percentage by comparable European standards.
2.31      Public expenditures on education are projected to grow at 8.4% p.a.
during the Third Program (1968-1972) and somewhat faster after the end of
that period. By 1980, they are expected to reach a level of about 1158
million (about 7% of GNP), which is a realistic target in relation to the develop-
ment requirements and the financial capabilities of the country. Total
capital expenditures on education during the period 1968-1980 are projected
at 1171 million. The growth of capital expenditures is expected to slow
down during the late 70's, after the completion of the current programs of



expansion and improvement. The projected allocation of capital funds by
educational levels and the expected distribution of recurrent expenditures
(Annex 5) reflect the emphasis on reform and consolidation of secondary
education and are consistent with the expected shift from arts to applied
sciences at the third level.
III. THE PROJECT
General
3.01      The proposed project would help to finance (i) construction of and
equipment for the new institutions listed below, and (ii) two man-years of
technical assistance:

Totals        57      12,145   9,765   21,910
Comprehensive Secondary Schools
3.02      The project would provide facilities and equipment for six new
state and 18 new community coeducational comprehensive schools; 14 of
which would be in rural areas. Five schools would be in new locations and
19 of them would replace 46 old and inefficiently small general secondary
institutions. These old schools would be discontinued as secondary institutions
as soon as the project schools are in operation. Some of the schools would
be used for primary education, others would be abandoned. The project schools
would provide about 16% of the expected increase of student capacity between
1970 and 1975.
3.03      The schools would be four different sizes - enrollments of 510;
810; 1,020; and 1,620. Each size of school would have standardized sche-
dules of accommodation to facilitate a systems approach to design and
building, and to introduce industrialized components.



- 10 -
3.04      In accordance witlh the government's education strategy and experi-
ence with the four pilot comprehensive schools started in 1966 (Appendix I,
paras. 10-13), the schools would have a broad curriculum including elective
academic and practical subjects.
Technical Education
3.05      The project Secondary Techniical School in Limerick and the Region-
al Technical College in Cork would add an output from 1977 to 1980 of about
3,500 skilled workers and middle-level technicians to that of existing in-
stitutions against a projected likely shortage of 7,000 in 1980; the output
of higher technicians and business graduates from the project schools would
add about 1,600 to that of existing institutions during the same period
against an estimated shortage of 11,000 (para. 2.15). These shortages would
be reduced further after 1980 by the cumulative output of the expanded tech-
nical education system including the project institutions. The three project
technical institutions, with a combined yearly enrollment of 13,300 (4,300
daytime; 9,000 evening) would contribute about 12% of the 1980 output of
Ireland's technical schools and colleges (Annex 10). The foregoing forecasts
take into account temporary or permanent outflow of skilled labor to the
United Kingdom which is at present virtually free of any restrictions. With
accelerated economic development and industrialization in Ireland, it is as-
sumed that the outflow will progressively slow down.
Regional Technical College, Cork
3.06      Existing technical education programs are housed in a collection
of seven old buildings in the approximate vicinity of the major institution,
the Crawford Municipal Technical Institute. The various schools, although
separate entities, are administered by the City of Cork Vocational Education
Committee under central government direction. The operation of this complex
is uneconomical; the facilities are ill adapted to modern technologies and
methods of instruction, and have no potential for expansion. Under the
proposed project, obsolete buildings of the existing institution would be
abandoned, and others would be used to expand enrollments at lower levels.
3.07      The proposed Regional Technical College would consolidate all of
the above activities within one institution, with the advantages of economies
of scale, central administration, integrated staffing and common services.
The larger institution also would serve not only the City of Cork, but
the nearby regions; an estinmated 25% of enrollments would come from County
Cork and from County Kerry. For some special programs such as hotel cater-
ing, marine engineering and rural science teaching, the College would be
the national training center.
3.08      The College's planned enrollment of 2,700 would increase the
present enrollment by 1,300 and would provide courses varying from one to
three years. An additional 4,000 students would be enrolled in evening



- 11 -
courses. The main programs would be apprenticeship and middle and higher
level technician courses in the fields of electrical, mechanical, civil,
chemical, marine, automotive and construction engineering, and in such
science-related fields as telecommunications, data processing, electronics,
and instrumentation. Full time pre-employment programs would be gradually
substituted for existing day and block release programs.
Senior Secondary Technical School, Limerick
3.09      The project school would provide modern buildings and equipment
to replace the present collection of temporary or rented quarters at var-
ious sites in this important industrial and commercial center. It would
provide 800 places (450 replacement) for technical programs at senior
secondary level, apprentice training, and junior technician programs which
are partly post-secondary.
3.10      Programs would include electrical, mechanical, automotive and
construction engineering fields at all levels, leading to both trades and
technician qualifications. As graduates would be eligible for higher educa-
tion, the curriculum would include sufficient instruction in academic sub-
jects such as Irish, English, mathematics, sciences and social studies;
the students would spend up to 40% of school time in technical subjects.
The school would provide the only advanced senior program (250 places) for
graduates of vocational or comprehensive schools in the attendance area,
and in addition a one-year advanced (applied science) program. Evening
programs would provide supervisory and management courses.
3.11      About 150 places would be provided for two and three-year junior
technician programs to be organized through conversion of existing block
release programs. About 1,000 apprentices would attend day and block
release programs.
3.12      Graduates of existing and proposed programs are readily employable
in the Limerick area which is experiencing marked industrial growth.
College of Commerce, Ballymun, Dublin
3.13      Dublin's technical education needs are served by three multi-
level institutions; the Kevin Street Institute of Technology, the Bolton
Street College of Technology and the Rathmines College of Commerce. Total
current enrollments in the three institutions exceed 4,800 full-time equiva-
lent day and evening students. Overcrowding has prevented the admission
of an additional 1,200 students qualified for existing courses, and has
prevented the establishment of new courses in response to developing man-
power needs.
3.14      The Dublin Vocational Education Committee, whicth is responsible
for the administration of technical education, has recognized the danger
of further unplanned expansion of multi-level institutions, and has pro-
posed the establishment of a new post-secondary College of Technology and



- 12 -
Commerce. The first phase of the development would be the College of
Commerce, for which Bank financing is requested, in order to replace
existing inadequate facilities, and to provide for urgently needed expan-
sion. Deferment of the technical-industrial phase will permit better
evaluation of the impact on tertiary education needs of the regional
technical colleges and the comprehensive secondary schools now under
development.
3.15      The curriculum would include full time programs of one to three
years' duration in business studies, secretarial, personnel management,
data processing and commercial art, and would enroll about 400 students.
Day and block release courses in the foregoing programs and in supervisory
and management programs, would enroll about 1,200 additional, equal to
about 400 full-time equivalent students. The phased development of the
college complex will permit speedy response to the identified shortage of
skilled and managerial levels in the commercial sector.
Agricultural Education Centers
3.16      The 30 non-residential centers, which also would serve as offices
for the extension staff, would each contain one multi-purpose hall, one
demonstration kitchen, and one farm workshop; ten of the centers would also
contain a home demonstration room.
3.17      Each center would offer a two-year course for junior secondary
school leavers (Grade 9) two days per week from September to March. During
the farming season (April to August) monthly lecture-demonstration sessions
and farm practice on private farms would be conducted under the guidance
of the staff. All students would receive a common course comprising crop
husbandry, farm buildings, farm machinery and equipment, horticulture,
forestry, cooperatives and records. An additional 50 hours of instruction
would be provided in specialized options.
3.18      In addition, farmers, aged 18 to 35 years, would attend the center
one day per week during the winter months to receive approximately 100
hours of instruction in the principles of farm management. The teaching
staff would follow the progress of trainees during the summer months with
periodic visits to provide guidance on-the-job.
3.19      The balance of the teaching programs would consist of four to
eight week courses for girls in home economics, horticulture and poultry,
and various short courses in agricultural extension techniques. The centers
are expected to be used intensively on an ad hoc basis for meetings, lec-
tures and seminars on matters of agricultural interest.
3.20      The agricultural extension staff - all university graduates -
would teach the farmer education courses. The 30 centers would have a
combined annual minimum output of 750 boys; 600 young adults, and 300 girls
from the formal classes.



- 13 -
Technical Assistance
3.21      Professional services are needed to:  (a) evaluate and establish
appropriate economic norms and educational specifications; (b) introduce
a systems approach to design and construction in order to reduce building
costs; (c) integrate use of prefabricated or industrialized elements in
the project schools; and (d) supervise and coordinate all aspects of imple-
mentation. A total of two man-years of technical assistance (US$100,000)
would be included in the project for specialists in (a) educational facil-
ity planning, and (b) construction systems development. These services
would be rendered through short-term assignments of specialists and brief
study missions abroad.
Cost of the Project
3.22      The estimated costs and foreign ekchange components of the various
parts of the project are summarized below (Annex 6):

- 14 -
Overall Costs
3.23      The distribution of costs by category of expenditure is given
in Annex 7. Academic and communal facilities account for 58% of the total
project cost; equipment and furniture 15.6%; technical assistance 0.3%;
professional fees 7.7% and site development 6.2%. The capital unit costs
per student place of $1,122 for the comprehensive schools, $1,525 for the
technical institutions and $770 for the agricultural education centers are
reasonable (Annex 8).
Contingencies
3.24      The project cost includes a contingency allowance for unforeseen
factors equal to 5% of estimated costs for buildings, site development and
professional fees; and 2.5% for furniture and equipment. The estimated
unit costs are expected to increase by about 5% p.a. and therefore the
project cost also includes an allowance for price escalation equal to 10%
for building, site development and professional fees and 5% for furniture
and equipment (Annex 9). No contingencies have been included for technical
assistance because of the small amount involved and since it will be pro-
vided at the beginning of the project. Thus, the contingency allowances
amount to 12% of the total project cost including contingencies (Annex 9).
3.25      Foreign exchange components:  The foreign component, US$13.0
million equivalent, representing about 40% of the total project cost, has
been calculated as follows: (i) site development 15%; (ii) buildings
38%; (iii) professional services 5%; (iv) furniture 20%; (v) equipment
90%; and (vi) technical assistance 80%.
3.26      Recurrent costs:  Annual recurrent costs of the project institu-
tions would be about I4.5 million (US$10.8 million). Ireland is able to
meet these expenditures and its share of the capital costs without compro-
mising other high priority educational or other government expenditures.
Justification
3.27      Despite considerable improvements over the past ten years, the
Irish education system is still ill-suited to the development needs of the
country, both in qualitative and in quantitative terms. Lack of capital
funds, institutional constraints, academic orientation and inability to
meet the growing demand for technical and managerial skills are the main
shortcomings. The educational reform, now at the beginning of implemen-
tation, aims at a greater efficiency and productivity of the system (para.
2.23). The emphasis on vocational and technical education, reform and
consolidation of general education is consistent with the social and eco-
nomic development strategy and with the projected pattern of growth. The
proposed project is expected to contribute to the reform of the system by:
(i) reforming and consolidating the general secondary school system
and replacing outmoded institutions;



- 15 -
(ii)  expanding the technical education system in order to meet man-
power requirements (paras. 2.14 and 2.15) and the need for
retraining of labor displaced by technological progress;
(iii)  improving the supply of qualified managers, executives and
kindred workers as required by the expected growth in the
industrial and service sectors; and
(iv)  upgrading the level of farmers' training as a prerequisite for
increasing farming efficiency, fully exploiting Ireland's agri-
cultural potential and keeping the rate of rural migration at
a level consistent with overall employment objectives.
Technical assistance is included in order to strengthen the Building Unit
within the Department of Education with specialists in educational facility
planning and construction systems development.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION
Administration
4.01      A Project Unit is being established within the Building Unit of
the Department of Education to supervise the project's implementation,
coordinate activities within the government and with private bodies, and
provide iiaison with the Bank. The officers of the Project Unit would
consist of: (i) the Principal Officer of the Building Unit who would
serve as Project Director on a part-time basis; (ii) a Liaison Officer
who would represent the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries part-time
and (iii) a Deputy Project Director, a Project Architect and a Project
Educator, appointed on a full-time basis. The Project Director, the Liai-
son Officer and the Deputy Project Director have already been appointed.
The establishment and operation of the Project Unit, provided with adequate
accounting and procurement services, supporting staff and facilities, would
be a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.
Procurement
4.02      Civil works, furniture and equipment supply contracts would be
awarded in accordance with Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank Loans.
Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preferential
margin of 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing imports or the existing rate
of duty, whichever is lower. Items would be grouped to the extent practicable
to form sizable bid packages and to permit bulk procurement. The Project
Unit would be responsible for preparing and issuing tenders, evaluating bids,
and awarding the contracts. Detailed master lists of furniture and instruc-
tional equipment would be submitted for Bank review prior to procurement.



- 16 -
It is expected that only a few foreign firms would submit bids, except for
equipment, since Ireland has well developed and competitive furniture man-
ufacturing and construction industries.
4.03      Total construction under the project would correspond to less
than 1% of the value of recent annual construction activity. An adequate
number of qualified building contractors are available for all project
locations and an appropriate pre-qualification system is in operation.
4.04      The project institutions would be designed by consultant archi-
tects agreeable to the Bank and commissioned on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. An ample supply of qualified architects (over
180 professional firms) is available in Ireland.
4.05      Suitable sites have been selected for all 24 comprehensive schools
and the three technical institutions, and no problems are foreseen regarding
thieir acquisition. The government has supplied the Bank with a satisfactory
schedule for acquisition of sites for the agricultural education centers.
The government has also provided assurances that the title to all sites will
be acquired as required to avoid delays in construction. As the College of
Commerce would be part of the future College of Commerce and Technology, the
government has given an assurance that it will provide the Bank with a com-
plete site development plan, acceptable to the Bank, within nine months of
the signing of the Loan Agreement.
Disbursements
4.06      The proposed loan would be disbursed (Annex 12) on the basis of
100% of the c.i.f. costs of imported furniture and equipment, and technical
assistance costs, and 32% of the costs of civil works contracts and locally
manufactured furniture and equipment. This percentage would be adjusted to
distribute disbursements over the project period. Undisbursed funds would
be available for cancellation.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations the government provided assurances about:
(i)  acquisition of titles to all school sites (para. 4.05);
and
(ii)  preparation of a site development plan for the College
of Commerce and Technology.



- 17 -
5.02      The establishment and operation of an adequately staffed Project
Unit, in satisfactory premises, would be a condition of effectiveness of
the Loan Agreement (para. 4.01).
5.03      The project is suitable as a basis for a Bank Loan of US$13.0 mil-
lion to Ireland for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.
The loan, which would finance foreign exchange costs, would be equivalent to
about 40% of the estimated project cost.






APPENDIX I

EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Administration  (Chart 1)
1.        The administration of education in Ireland at the primary and
secondary levels is highly decentralized. Primnary schools are organized
by religious denominations under local management. General secondary
schools are owned and operated by religious orders; teclhnical and voca-
tional schools by county vocational committees. The IMinister of Education
is responsible for formulation of policy, initiation of legislation,
approval of curricula and terminal examinations, and for the supervision
of primary and secondary education. hiowever, the management of the
schools retains the right to appoint staff but is expected to conform
witli governlment regulations on teachiers' qualifications, salary schedules,
class size and contact hours. A development section has been created in
the Department of Education to promote primary and secondary education
development in relation to Irish needs and international trends and to
serve the system with developmenit of curricula, teaching aids, and teach-
ing methods.
2.        A Higher Education Authority, consisting of representatives of
academic, educational, agricultural and industrial interests, advises the
Minister of Education on overall planning and coordination of higher edu-
cation. Post-secondary institutions operate under charter and are
autonomous except that they, like primary and secondary schools, are
largely dependent upon government grants to meet operating costs.
Structure of Education
3.         The school system  provides for a six-year compulsory course,
normally beginning at the age of six; a secondary level with a three-year
junior (lower) and a two-year senior (upper) cycle; a higher level of
technical and university courses (Chart 2).  Most primary schools provide
kindergarten (pre-primary) classes for 1-2 years.
4.         There is an undue emphasis on academic secondary education;
about 17% of senior 3econdary stu(lents are enrolled in vocational or
teclhnical courses. Thie secondary system is at present in the process of
transition.  Four pilot experimental compreihensive schools incorporating
both academic and practical education hiave been started and the govern-
ment plans to replace gradually the private academic secondary institu-
tions with comprehensive schools.

Primary Education (Annex 1)
5.        Primary education is free and compulsory for six years between
the ages of 6 and 14. Total enrollment in 1969 was 383,324 schools. About
5,300 students receive education in special classes and about 10% of the
total enrollment receive remedial teaching. Government aided schools
accounted for 95.2% of total enrollments. Kindergarden classes enrolled
about 125,000 pupils. Due to the presence of students below and above the
relevant age group (6-11), the total enrollment in primary education was
more than 100% (106.8%). However, the picture is changing - an increasing
number of students enter school at the minimum compulsory school age of
six - and by 1980, the primary school system is expected to have capacity
for about 100% of the age group 6-11 (Chart 4). The enrollment is equally
distributed between boys and girls in both rural and urban areas. The
primary school curriculum provides instruction in both acadeinic and
practical subjects. A rotating curriculum revision system is being
introduced.
6.        The number of teachers in government primary schools was about
11,000 in 1969, and of these 90% was qualified. The teacher:pupil
ratio was 1:33.  The government expects a primary enrollment of about
400,000 in 1980 and hopes to achieve a teacher:pupil ratio of 1:30.
Secondary Education (Annexes 1 & 2)
7.        The basic data for this level (12-16 age group) for 1968/69
is as follows:

S.        All junior and about 95% of senior secondary education is
government aided. There are 638 academic general secondary schools and
241 continuation secondary sclhools in the country witli an average size
of about 200 students.  Tlhe continuation scihools liave a mainly academic
program but offer pre--vocational suLbjects such as woodwork, metalwork
anZd typing.  Many of thie schools hiave ol]d and inadequate facilities wihich
need replacement.  The buildings are usually owned by religious orders.
The courses prepare mainly for university entrance (School Leaving
Certificate).  Some 95%O of tile primary sclhool leavers entered secondary
level in 1968.  Almost 100%) of tile studetnts finish the first two years
of tihe junior cycle and 72% finishi the three--year junior cycle.  About
65%io of the junior cycle leavers enter the senior cycle and the dropout
rate in the senior cycle is only about 4%.
9.        In 1969, about 80% of thie teachers were qualified. At present,
students may leave sclhool after tw,o years in tlle junior cycle, but after
1972, the compulsory schlool years will include six years of primary and
tlhree years of junior secondary.  The government estimates, therefore, a
junior secondary enrollnient of 1i5,000 and a senior secondary enrollment
of 75,000 in 1930 (Chart 4).
Comprelhensive Schools
10.       A pilot program aimed at:  (a) reform of the general secondary
education structure and curriculum; (b) development of space standards;
and (c) economy of sclhool construction was started in 1966 by the govern-
ment in cooperation withi reli-ious orders and county education authori-
ties. The pilot project consists of four schools (500-600 students in
eachl) located in both urban and rural areas.
11.       The schools are administratively of two types:  state compre-
hensives have Boards of Ilanageinent consisting of representatives from
the government, t'he religious orders and the county autlhorities; the
community comprehensives' Boards represent only religious orders and
county authorities. The five--year sclhools offer a three-year junior
cycle and a two-year senior cycle.  The curricula for both junior and
senior cycles include a comemon core of academic and practical subjects.
Ilective subjects are offered in the junior cycle in foreign languages,
science, arts and crafts, industrial arts, hiome economiics and commerce.
At the discretioni of the respective F3oard of M1anagement, subject groups
selected from  the follow,ing are offeredt in the scnior cycle:  languages,
social stutdies, science, busiLness, and appllied science. Applied science
groups include engineering, natural and physical science and agriculture.
12.       An essential feature of thec schlools is thie deferral of student
decision-making about career clhoice and specific education program.  The
new emplhasis is away from rote learning and in the direction of self-
motivated study and problem solving in a variety of related subject fields.



APPENDIX I
Page 4
Whkile the gracluates of practical courses are not re;arded as fully trained,
junior cycle programs provide a suitable basis for future vocational anid
apprentice training and students completing senior cycle receive the
School Leaving Certificate leading to employment or to furtlher post-secondary
education.
13.       The pilot scliools have successfully contributed to coordination
of education efforts by tlhe governmenit, religious orders and county autho-
rities.  The governmnent's long--term  policv is to develop the comprehensive
sclhool concept furtlher and to reform and1 consolidate the entire general
secondary school system  according to thiis pattern.
Technical Educationi
14.       In 1963, the government set in motion a study of the education
system  to identify those measures necessary to integrate general and
tectinical education, and to better relate technical and vocational edu-
cation to the manpower needs of the country.  Since 1966, the progress
hias been of suchI scope and deptli that tie old and reformed systems exist
concurrently and tihe usual reporting procedures snowing trends, demand
factors, inputs, outputs, shortages, and measures of the quality of out-
put are of little relevance. The refor,n programn, still very much in the
early stages of implementation, has not yet produced graduates for the
labor market.
15.       The coeducational vocational sc:hools, operated by the Department
of Education, offer two types of programs: (a) continuation education for
two years, and under the reformil program for tihree years, leading to the
Group Certificate and employi,ent; and (b) techlntical education of five
years' duration in a broader range of courses leading to employment or to
further education.  Thie old system may be clharacterized as uneconomical,
lacking opportunities for thie introduction of modern concepts and methods
of instruction, and for pupil guidance and programming in relation to
manpower needs.  As fast as vested interest can be influenced and resour-
ces will permit, these schools and programs will be replaced by compre-
henssive coeducational schools with exploratory pre--vocational programs
for iadustrial, commercial and service occupations.  In selected larger
comprelhcensive schools, a techlnical Leaving Certificate programn of a stan-
dard eqolivaleint to thLe academic Leaving; Certificate will be introduced.
Post--SecondarY Level
16.       To nmeet thle need for persons trained for techinician level pro-
duction and supervisorv jobs in industrial, commercial and service fields,
and to meet the miscellaneous traininlg needs of residents, seven regional
colleges have been developed withi a planned capacity of 8,000 students.



APPENDIX I
Page 5
Their most advanced offerings are two and three-year post-secondary pro-
grams leadings to qualifications recognized by various British examining
bodies and other professional bodies. In addition, the centers offer
apprenticeship training, part-time courses, and the technical Leaving
Certificate program. Notable gaps in the services of this type of insti-
tution exist in the major cities of Dublin and Cork (existing facilities
are scattered and often absolete), and in Limerick where there are no
facilities.
Apprentice Training
17.       Apprentice training is primarily the responsibility of ANCO,
the Industrial Training Authority established in 1967. It is a semi-
autonomous corporation financed by industrial levies and government
grants and operates apprenticeship, upgrading, updating, and re-training
programs. Three such training centers have been built and a fourth is
under construction; total capacity is 1,000 training places.
Agricultural Education and Training
18.       The Minister of Education is responsible for the agricultural
and related science courses offered by government-run secondary schools.
All other agricultural education, including farmer training, undertaken
by the agricultural extension services, comes under the Minister of
Agriculture and Fisheries.
19.       Agricultural training is offered by the agricultural extension
services in agricultural education centers or in rented space (vocational
schools and hotels) and in nine rural domestic economy schools which offer
one-year courses for girls over the age of 15.
20.       There are ten agricultural colleges; three public and seven
private; all state-aided. These are small institutions (35-110 enrollment)
for young men between the ages of 15 and 30. Each college offers a one-
year course leading to the National Certificate in Agriculture. There are
also special courses of 1-2 years duration in pig husbandry, dairy farming,
and other areas of special interest. In addition to these ten colleges, the
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries offers a two-year non-residential
course in horticulture for both men and women at the National Botanic
Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin. Two-year residential courses in horticulture
are offered at Warrenstown Agricultural College and at the Horticultural
College in Termonfeckin.
21.       The agricultural education centers are focal points for agri-
cultural activities within counties and increase the efficiency of the
extension service by: (a) providing training and education facilities
for young persons entering the agricultural sector; (b) offering up-
grading courses to farmers; and (c) providing high-level training for
extension workers. Two main courses are offered. The normal course is
designed for youngsters wio have completed junior secondary schooling.

Thc course met ts two days pc r week for fi vc hours eachl day fromL September
to :arcih.  During the sumnier  oulo1tlis tbe students are supervised in prac-
tical traiLing on farms.  This basic cour.;, involves 18 9 hours in crop
husb andry, ani;iial husbandlry, maintenan-ice of farm build ings and equipment,
liorticulture, forestry, and record keeping.  An acdditional .30 hours is
schleduled to meet local andl individual studeat needs.  The advanced farm
nmanageiiunt course for farmzers agu 16A--35 meets from September to March one
day per week five hours per day.
22.       AAbout 4,90Q1 young, men entler agricultural occupations yearly,
but facilities for only 600 are available in existing colleges.  The
20 existing agricultural education ceniters enroll about 500) of these
young men yearly as well as 30() farmners and 30l  young wonmen.  The addi-
tional 30 centers proposedl in the project would provicde traiaing for
about 1,650.  Tthe centers also provide off-farm  training for lhousewives
and farmers in ad--hoc courses, lectures, demonstrations, and farmers'
mleetings.  Lacih center offers programs gearedl to local agricultural needs
and ilnterests.
LliL;her Education
23.        In 1968/69, total enrollment in higher education was 22,252
compared withl 17,6U0  in 1965/66.  One--third of the students were girls.
The teacber:pupil ratio was as high as 1:22.  -iilger education is in
great demand.  The output from general secondary education was 14,529 in
1967/63; but the inta'e in higlher education was about 4,100.
24.        There are two universities and four recognized colleges with a
total enirollmeent of 16,618. Various sectors of professional and techni-
cal education - principally medicine, law, teclhnology and commerce - are
provided for in separate private or government institutions or form part
of education scHemes organized by country education committees.  The
majority of studetnts take courses in arts and social sciences; about 12%
arc enirolled in engineering andl related technical fields.
25.        'Most hiigler education is subsidizecd from public funds.  Only
9.1 1. of the studlenLts are enrolled in noi--aided institutions.  Tlle ilighier
Education Autlhority has projected total etnrollTrenits to reach about 30,000
by 1975 and 33,200 by 1930 anid plans to slightly reduce the teacher:pupil
ratio in aided institutions.
Teachier Training
26.        Because of ongoing education reform programs, the Minister of
Educationi in 1969, requested the Highier Education Authority to advise
him on requirements for teacher training.  The Authority published a
report in September 1970, including recommendations on policy and planning.



APPENDIX I
Page 7
The Authlority also recommended the creation of a special body responsible
for planning and coordination of all levels of teacher training. Thle
report has been circulated to institutions and agencies for review and
comments.
Prirary Teaclher Training
27.       Primary teacner training is offeredl in a two-year course fol-
lowing completed secondary education.  The enrollment in 1968/69, was
1,334 students and the outpult 573.  Training was given in six colleges
with an average size of about 220. Two--thir(ds of the students were girls.
28.       The quality of primary teacher training seems to be acceptable.
The Department of Education and private institutions also offer in-service
programs to help adapt the teachers to curriculum changes and to introduce
new teaching met'aods.  About 4,01)0 teachers received in-service training
in 1969.
29.       The present stock of qualified teachers in primary sclhools is
about 10,000.  With a teacher pupil ratio of 1:30 by 1980, the need for
teachers in primary schiools will be about 13,500. An additional 7,500
teachers need to be trained over the 10-year period to meet this need.
Expansion of the course to three years is under examination.  If this
goes into effect this will create a necd for additional teaching facili-
ties.  Additional teaclhers will also be needed for pre-primary students.
General Secondary Teacher Tr-ain     (Annex 2)
30.       Secondary school teachiers of academic subjects have a degree
course of at least three years and in addition a one-year part-time
course for the Hli-her Diploma in Education. Their training is offered
at eight institutions. The output of teachers was about 670 in 1963.
31.       The present stock of teaclhers in general subjects is about
7,000. The total need for teachers by 1975/76 will be about 10,400
assumning a teaclier:pupil ratio of 1:20. An addlitionial 5,500 teachers
need to be trained to meet thie need.  Teacher training needs to conform
with modern teaching metlhods and ongoing; curriculum reform.  Educational
goals and standards need to be coordinated between the different teacher
training Institutions.  The recommendation by thie Autlhority to make the
Di)ploma coursu full-t-ime seems to be fully justified.  Equally, the prac-
tical training of teachers needs to be more efficiently organized.
Teclnical Teacher Tralniti, (Annex 2)
32.       All secondary teachiers of industrial, business, and domestic
science subjects are required to hold technical qualifications appropri-
ate to the level of instruction and, ln addition, teaching qualifications.



APPENDIX I
Page 8
Industrial teaclhers are trained1 in tvo special purpose institutions for
post-primary, apprenticeship or adult eclucation courses.  In addition,
upgrading and updatin,; summer courses are regular fcatures.  Teaclhers of
senior industrial and applied science courscs are engineering graduates
withi emnployment experience as well as training in teachin- metiiods.
Similarly, business teaclhers complete a degree program, and after employ-
ment experience, obtain special certificates in tvping, shiorthand and
business education.  ilome econoiAics teachers follow  tlhree-year programs
in two special purpose colleges.
33.        The anaual output of technical teachers is in approximate
balance with projected demand.  The four pilot comprehensive s.chools have
had no difficulty in attracting better qualified teaclhers for ttleir pre-
vocational programs.
34.        The IHighier Education Autliority Report on Teachier Education
gives the following .stimatud output of special teachers in 1969/70:

EDUCATIOtN FINANCE
1.        Although the administrationi of education in Ireland is highly de-
centralized, financial responsibility for education rests primarily with
the central government. The Department of Education handles 90% of central
government expenditures; the Department of Agriculture the remaining 10%.
Recurrent expenditure for vocational education is shared by local authorities
(about one-third) through the Vocational Education Committees.
2.        The distinction in Ireland between "public" and "private" schools
requires definition. At the primary level, 95% of enrollments are in pub-
lic schlools and 5% in private schools. The private sclhools do not receive
state funds and they charge fees.  The public sclhools, altlhough almost en-
tirely financed by the government, are often managed by local clergymen;
the sites are provided by religious orders.  Public primary schools are
free; teachers' salaries, otlier recurrent costs, and most capital costs are
paid by the government.
3.        Prior to the pilot comprehensive sclhool experitnent (1966), all
secondary schools were private and both charged fees and received some gov-
ernment support.  Most of the private secondary schools are owned and op-
erated by religious orders yet they receive financial aid from the govern-
ment. Free transport in rural areas is provided from state funds. Since
1967, most (95% of day students in 1968) students no longer pay tuition fees;
instead, the government gives the schools direct suppletmiental grants (E25
per pupil). Needy parents receive textbook grants. A large part of teach-
ers' salaries and their pensions are paid by the state; capitation grants
(E13-El9 for junior secondarv: E15-E24 for senior secondary) are paid to
those schools meeting certain requirements set by the Department of Educa-
tion. Schools also receive equipment grants (Up to 70% of cost) for science
laboratories, geographv rooms, etc., and btuilding improvement loans to
schools are arranged at very favorable conditions by the Department of Edu-
cation.
4.         Current and capital costs are nmet entirely by the central govern-
mnent in the two pilot state comprehensive schools. This will be the case
in the project state comprehiensives. A local contribution was made to the
capital cost of the two pilot community comprehensive schools, and will be
negotiated individuallv for the project community comprehensives.  No
school fees are paid in any of the comprehensive schools.
5.        Vocational and teclnical eduication is provided free of charge in
most schools (only 5% of dav pupils pay fees).  About 70% of recurrent ex-
penditure is financed througlh government grants to the Vocational Education
Committees; the remainder is provided by local revenues (a surcharge not
exceeding 10% on the local rate). The greater part of capital expenditure
for vocational school building is financed by the government, either through
loans to Vocational Education Committees or through grants to Local Autlhor-
ities. Apprentice training is primarily the responsibility of the Indus-



APPENDIX II
Page 2
trial Training Authority (ANCO), a semi-autonomous corporation financed by
industrial levies and government grants.
6.        Fees are charged in universities and other post-secondary institu-
tions. A certain amount of scholarships are now provided (EO.3 million in
1968/69). The government contributes an increasing share of recurrent ex-
penditures (73.6% in 1968/69).  The tniversities are also heavily dependernt
on the government for their capital program.
7.        Since 1958, public expenditure on education has grown at 13.4%
p.a. in monetary terms and at about 6-6.5% p.a. at constant prices, i.e.,
much faster than total public expenditures and GNP (Annex 4). In 1969/70
recurrent expenditures on education represented about 12% of current
revenues and capital expenditures accounted for 7.9% of tk -capital budget.
As a percentage of GNP, public expenditures on education Japreased from
2.9% in 1958 to 4.9% in 1970.  Because of the lack of information on priv-
ate expenditures (especially for boarding), no reliable data of national
expenditure on education are available.
8.        The distribution of public capital expenditures on education by
levels over the nast three years was the following:
1967/68   1968/69   1969/70         Total
-(Irish E millions)-------
Primary              2.3        3.5       3.7       9.5 ( 30.9%)
Secondary            3.6        5.2       6.3      15.1 ( 49.0%)
Post-secondary       1.3        2.3       2.6       6.2 ( 20.1%)
Total           7.2      11.0       12.6      30.8 (100.0%)
9.        Since the beginning of the 1960's, recurrent expenditures on edu-
cation have grown much faster than total enrollments. Price inflation, in-
creases in teachers' salaries and the shift in the composition of total
student population brought about by the faster growth of enrollments in the
more expensive secondary schools were major factors. Moreover, under the
Free Education Scheme (1967) and other recent Acts there have been both a
"widening" of the scope of government intervention in education (more stu,t-
dents are affected by the nrogram) and a "deepening" of transfers (the
amount of grants per student has increased).  For this reason, the growth
of public recurrent expenditures per student reflects both the increase in
unit costs and the increase in the share of unit costs paid by the govern-
ment:

/2   All second level.
/3   Primary teachers and some vocational (woodwork, metalwork, domestic
science, motor maintenance).
10.        Public expenditures on education are expected to increase from
58.8 million (4.6%' of GNP) in 1968 to L150 million (about 7% of GNP) in
1980, i.e., at 8.6% p.a. in real terms. Thlis target is in line with current
or expected developments in most European countries, and is consistent with
the development requirements and the financial possibilities of the country.
By 1972/73 (final year of the Thlird Program), public expenditures on educa-
tion should account for 13.7% of total public expenditure, with recurrent
expenditures representing 14.2% of current revenues and capital expenditures
7.8%o of the total capital budget.
11.        The projection of capital expenditures on education for the next
decade is based on the (reasonable) assumption that only about E75 million
(43.8% of total) will be required for expansion, while the remaining 96
million will be allocated to improvements and replacements (see Chart 4 for
enrollment projections).  About one-half of total investments is expected to
go to secondary education, the balance being distributed evenly between
primary schools and post-secondary inslitutions.  The projected costs per
place (1969 prices) for primary, secondary and post-secondary schools are
E169, 400 and E1,500 respectively.  A gradual increase from the current
levels was assumed.  This would allow for quality improvements (primary
level), more space per pupil (secondary schools) and increased emphasis on
applied sciences (post-secondary institutions).
12.        Recurrent expenditures on education are expected to grow from
47.8 million in 1968 to about 141 million in 1980, i.e., at 9.4% p.a. in
real terms.  Tihe following table gives the projection of recurrent costs
per student.  Thle based assuml1ptions are:  (a) decrease in the number of pri-
mary schools anrd the pupil: teacher ratio: (b) reform and consolidation of
secondary edlucation (comprehensive schools and regional teclinical colleges);
(c) increase in the length of the training course for primary teachers (3
years); (d) gradual slhift froLmi arts to applied science at the third level;
more schiolarslhips; decrease in the student:teacher ratio.

of recurrent expenditures by education levels:
1968     1975      198O
Primary                            45.9      30.9     29.8

TOTAL                       100.0    100.0    100.0
The projected increase at the secondary level is consistent with the ex-
pected growth of unit costs and enrollments. The slow growth of population
and a better utilization of educational facilities and personnel explain
the declining percentage of recurrent expenditures at the primary level.
The projected rapid increase in unit cost and enrollments at the post-
secondary level is reflected in tile increasing slhare of public funds allo-
cated to that sector.

MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS
1.        A projection of Ireland's manpower requirements over the period
1966-1980 was carried out by the Manpower Forecasting Unit in the Department
of Labor. A multi-stage approach was adopted. The basic assumptions of
the exercise and some of the main results are discussed here.
2.        The macro-economic projections underlying the forecast can be
summarized as follows: 1/
AVERAGE RATES OF GROWTH PER ANNUM, 1969-1980
Agriculture    Industry    Services    Economy
Labor Productivity               6.0         3.4           1.4         3.5
Employment                   (-)4.0          3.0           1.3        0.6
Gross Domestic Product
(at factor cost)              2.0          6.5           2.7        4.1
On the whole, the projected pattern of growth is in line with the develop-
ment path envisaged in the Third Program. The slight acceleration of
technical progress compared with historical trends, is justified given
the stage of technological development and the perspective of a more
stimulating external environment. The projected increase in agricultural
productivity depends primarily on the acceleration of rural migration
(already observed) together with the subsequent reduction of "disguised
unemployment" in that sector.
3.        A complicated set of simultaneous inter-relationships link toge-
ther variables such as the rate and pattern of growth of the economy, the
level of emigration and the size, sex composition and age structure of the
population and labor force. The crucial variable in Ireland is the rate of
emigration2/. By using different assumptions on emigration, a range of
population projections was prepared by the Irish Central Statistical Office.
Alternative participation rates (by sex and by age groups) were then ap-
plied and the results were tested against the projections of sector output
and employment. The variant chosen for the manpower forecast seems to be
fairly reasonable on the basis of past experience. Population growth is
projected at 0.8% p.a. from 2.9 million in 1966 to 3.2 million in 1980;
the total amount of emigration during the period being estimated at
187,000 3/. The labor force is expected to increase from 1.1 million to
1.2 million, while total employment should grow by some 84,000 units to
1/   A set of alternative and somewhat more optimistic projections was
prepared by the Planning Commission in the Department of Finance.
However, a sensitivity analysis exercise showed that, under reasonable
assumptions on productivity growth, the differences in terms of
employment projections are marginal.
2/   Alternative assumptions about fertility will not affect the labor force
by 1980. Barring catastrophic developments (war, epidemics, etc.), the
long-term trend of mortality rates is reasonably predictable.
3/   The projected rates of emigration for the periods 1966-71, 1971-76 and
1967-80 are 90,000, 65,000, and 32,000 respectively.

about 1,150,000.  As a result, the unemploymlent rate (4.7% in 1966) is ex-
pected to decline to 3.7%.
4.         Employment projections were then disaggregated in line with tile
Tlhird Program.  No attempt was imiade to test the consistency of thle forecast
by using input-output models. Tihe results obtained can be summarized as

5.         In projecting the occupational structure by sectors of economic
activity tihree methods are currently used:  (a) extrapolation of past
trends, (b) international cornmparisons, and (c) inter-firms comparisons.
The basic assumption is that there is a functional relationship between the
stages of economic and technological developr,ment and the structure of em-



APPENDIX III
Page 3
ploymeent 1/.  The first two approaches were used by thie Ilanpower Forecasting
Unit. Occupational matrices were prepared from Census data for 1951, 1961
and 1966, and the occupational trends observed were projected to 1980 on a
linear basis. Alternatively, a set of occupational coefficients was de-
rived by adapting the U.S. occupational matrix, as projected to 1975 by the
U.S. Department of Labor.  Given the state of the art, the results obtained
(Table 1) may be considered reasonably close. A tentative explanation may
be the relatively advanced stage of economic developnment in Ireland (which
lessens the scope for technical discontinuities) and the open character of
the economy (which links the prevailing technology to western standards).
6.        By definition, the net manpower demand at any future date is
equal to the total manpower requirements at that date less the current
manpower stock surviving during the forecast period. Survival factors
(allowing for mortality and retirements) were applied to the Irish occupa-
tional structure for 1966. Because of lack of data, the retirement coef-
ficients used are not occupationally specific and no allowance was made for
inter-occupational mobility. For various reasons (para 8) emigration was
not taken into account at this stage.  The results are summarized in the
following table:
1/   Current econometric research suggests that the best explanatory vari-
ables are output per worker and product per capita.  Significant re-
gression coefficients were obtainied for manufacturing. In other eco-
nomic sectors the occupational structures appear to be much more
"flexible". Cfr. OECD, Occupational and Educational Structures of the
Labor Force and Levels of Economic Development (Paris, 1970).

The matrix is based on an analysis of tlhe "education question"  which was
included in the 1966 Census of Population, and was prepared by the Manpower
Forecastinig Unit following consultations with thle Department of Education,
the Industrial Training Authority and the National Science Council. To a
considerable extent, it reflects normative judgments ratlher than interna-
tional comparisons or past trends (wlhich would be difficult to identify, due
to lack of data).  The matrix reflects tlhe general education strategy of
the country.
8.         Estimates of educational outflows by levels during tile period
1966-1980 were prepared by the Department of Education.  Projections of
stocks were obtained by applying age-participntion rates and distribution
rates to the projected populationl, based on the assumption that no W4orld
Bank funds would be made available for edtucationi. Transition coefficients
were derived (witlh some adaptation for balancing purposes) from  1967/68 and
1968/69 data.  The results were then adjusted according to projected rates
of participation (by ages and sex) to the labor market. After making al-
lowance for emigration from the labor force (93,000 or about 50% of total
emnigration) 1/, the total educational supply 1966-1980 was estimated at
517,000 2/.  Compared with the projected demand (528,000), this leaves a
1/   Thiis may be considered a sufficiently conservative assumption, since
(a) emigration is traditionally concentratedl in thle age group 14-34;
(b) thie average age at marriage in Ireland is very highi (in 1966, the
percentages single in the age groups 20-24 and 25-34 were 89.6% and
49.8% for males, and 74.8% and 31.0% for females).
2/   At a macro-level, it does not make any difference whetlher you deduct
emigration from the manpower stock surviving or from the net inflow
during tile period undler consideration. liowever, to the extent that
emigration affects the survivingy stock, thie question may arise whether
tlhe general leve]. of education of the required additional manpower in-
flow must be equivalent to the old (and presumably lower) standards or
to the new requiremenits.  To the extent that the new standards are gen-
erally required, no assumption on the age distribution of emigration
needs to be made.

gap of 19,000) persons, or 22,000 persons if frictional unenmployment (say
2io) is accounted for.  Assuming that both emigrationi and frictional unem-

lowing picture would emnerge:

1966-1930
9.        A comparison of the projected net demand and supply of educated
manpower in Ireland suggests the following conclusions:
(a)  on the whiole, the general secondary school seems able to
meet the increased manpower demand, at least quantitatively.
Some shortage may emerge at the senior cycle level.  However,
at that level tihe scope for substitution (more educated man-
power; capital initenisive methods) is likely to be substantial.
(b)  tile current sihortages of technicians and skilled workers are
likely to increase during tile 1970's; thle deficit by 1980
being estimatecl at 4,000 or 15,000, depending on the matrix
used.
(c)  even more acute is thie expected slhortage (13,000-15,000) of
business graduates and hiig,nur technicians (engineering, elec-
tronics, mecihanics, construction), the possibility of substi-
tution being limited by thke low percentage of university
students enrolled in technlical fields.
(d)  on the whole, the projected supply of university graduates
is clearly beyond the absorptive capacities of the labor
market.  However, since employment perspectives are likely
to be (lifterent for different faculties, a more detailed
analysis would be needed to qualify this conclusioni.
