PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA:  SECOND ATLANTICO DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 849-CO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second Atlantico
Development Project in Colombia, for which Loan 849-CO, in the amount of
US$5.0 million, was approved on June 29, 1972. The loan was reduced to
US$2.2 million in February 1977 and closed on September 30, 1981, after a
delay of two and a half years. The final disbursement was made in January
1982 and a further US$0.6 million was cancelled, so that the final loan
amount was US$1.6 million.
The PCR was prepared by Agricultural Division 2 of the Latin
America and Caribbean. Projects Department following a mission to Colombia
in March 1982 to collect final project data and evaluate project achieve-
ments in the field.
The draft report has been read in the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED). However, an audit of the project by OED staff has not
been undertaken. The draft report was sent to the Borrower--INCORA, HIMAT
and the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance--for comment on April 14, 1983.
Comments received from the Ministry of Finance and INCORA are attached as
Annex 1 and have been taken into account in the final version. The valu-
able assistance provided during preparation of this report by the staff of
the Borrower, INCORA and HIMAT is gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Second Atlantico Development Project (Loan 849-CO) was
appraised in October 1970 and reappraised in February 1972. It was approved
in June 1972. This project was a follow-up to the Atlantico Irrigation
Project (Loan 502-CO), whose progress was unsatisfactory at the time of
appraisal of the second-stage project.
2.        The purpose of the new project was to develop the remainder of the
project area avoiding the mistakes made under the first project. Thus,
instead of an irrigation project, a rainfed farming development was foreseen
on 17,000 ha (para 1.03). Through completion of a drainage system and
construction of farm roads in an area protected against flooding under Loan
502-CO, extensive livestock farming was to be converted into intensive crop
farming. The Bank loan was to partially finance: (a) construction of civil
works and project buildings; (b) purchase of equipment for operation and
maintenance and farm equipment; (c) foreign consultants and foreign
training; and (d) interest on the loan accrued before April, 1977
(para 2.01).
3.        The design for the main drainage system for the project area was
technically correct, but it was not properly managed; its construction was
very protracted; no funds were provided for maintenance during construction
(para 4.03); farmers are not prepared to pay drainage charges to finance
maintenance until the system is entirely satisfactory; the main interceptor
drain was breached after an exceptional storm in 1979, possibly because of
inadequate maintenance; the flooding in 1979 increased farmers'
dissatisfaction with the drainage system; and the whole area remains
predominantly as grassland with scattered 'shrubs.
4.         The agricultural system proposed at appraisal and used to justify
the project economically was incorrect, because it paid insufficient
attention to the climatic and soil conditions and the experience and concerns
of the farmers. Two crops a year were expected to be grown over 73% of the
drained area and the balance was to be used for grazing, and growing sorghum
for silage and forage crops for intensive milk and meat production (para
1.03). At the completion of disbursement 86% of the project area was still
used for extensive grazing, with the balance under subsistence crops (para
3.05).
5.        Farm incomes have increased during the project, but it is
considered that this has been almost entirely the result of the improvements
made to roads adjoining the project area and the recent improvements in the
price paid to farmers for milk (para 5.09). The farm area allocated to each
family was 8 ha, based on a budget in which most of the income was to come
from the sale of crops. Since the farms are essentially used for cattle
raising, it has been found that the farm size is not sufficient to support a
family without off-farm income (para 6.05). Since 22% of the land allocated
by INCORA was abandoned (para 5.02), a de facto increase in farm size has
taken place through redistribution of the abandoned land among those farmers
who remained in the project area.



- iv -
6.        On-farm land improvements were not carried out by INCORA, as
planned, because during the project the Government determined that all such
works should be carried out by farmers with the assistance of credit
(para 3.04).    This proved to be an entirely unworkable system because the
farmers were unwilling to undertake such risk.    Furthermore, most farmers had
bad debts from earlier years, accumulated in the cooperative formed under the
first stage of the project (Loan 502-CO).    This cooperative collapsed half
way during the second stage project and the agricultural bank would not
extend further credit without a guarantee from INCORA, but INCORA had fully
committed its guarantee fund elsewhere in Colombia.
7.        The economic rate of return estimated at appraisal was 23%. Now,
it is almost certain that project costs in each year will exceed net
incremental benefits so that no rate of return can be calculated (para 5.11).
8.        The Government will have to improve and maintain the civil works
already constructed and minor additional works are required to protect the
limited area (800 ha) of good soils from flooding (para 7.10).      Operational
costs can be reduced by limiting INCORA staff to those required to provide
technical assistance in the only viable field of milk and meat production,
for which a large margin for improvement still exists (para 5.13).



I. BACKGROUND
1.01        This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Second Atlantico
Development Project in Colombia, for which Loan 849-CO for US$5.0 million,
was approved in June 1972. The loan was closed nine and a quarter years
later (September 1981) after US$3.4 million, or 68% of the original loan
amount, had been cancelled.
1.02        This projecl: was intended to complete a program initiated by the
Colombian authorities in the 1960s, to alleviate rural poverty in the project
area (para 2.01 and Map IBRD 3245R3).    The Bank has been associated with the
program since June 1966 when a mission visited Colombia to evaluate the
managerial capacity of the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA)
to undertake a 35,000-ha project, and the suitability for irrigation of the
soils in the area.
1.03        The first stage of the program was supported by Loan 502-CO made
in 1967 for the Atlantico Irrigation Project to develop 3,900 ha under
irrigation and to protect a further 6,000 ha from flooding. Experience with
irrigation development under the first stage had been negative and therefore
the second stage of the program, which constituted the Second Atlantico
Development Project, was to extend by 11,000 ha the area protected from
flooding, to a total of 17,000 ha suitable for growing two crops each year by
dry farming. For the purpose of economic analysis of the second stage, it
was projected that: (a) 12,400 ha would be used to grow two crops a year:
sorghum, maize and soybeans in the first semester, and sesame, maize,
soybeans, cotton, groundnuts, and tomatoes would be grown in the second
semester;   at a later stage, beans, tobacco, onions, melons, and various
fruits and vegetables might also be included; and (b) 4,600 ha would be
developed as dairy farms that would initially have field crops, forage and
pasture crops, but gradually the field crops would be phased out as the dairy
enterprises reached ful:l development.
1.04        The proposa:Ls for the second stage of development were based
on a project preparation report and background material prepared by INCORA
with the assistance of consultants and on the findings of a Bank appraisal
mission which visited Colombia in October 1970. These proposals were
questioned extensively wiithin the Bank and Colombia; therefore, a further
Bank mission visited Colombia in February 1972 to update the appraisal
report, which was, however, not materially changed from the initial proposals
and the appraisal was finalized as Report No. PA-84b, issued on June 2,
1972. This was shortly after the Operations Evaluation Division (OED) of the
Programming and Budgeting Department had issued Report No. Z-18 of May 25,
1972 concerning "Bank Operations in Colombia: An Evaluation." The OED
report (pages 136-142) questioned the technical assumptions underlying the
proposal for the second stage. It pointed out that: "Another upward revision
in the minimum size family unit may be required in the dry farming part,
where most project beneficiaries are located, in order to reach net family
incomes projected at appraisal, unless a more profitable cropping pattern can
be effectively developed and implemented", and concluded "that the Bank



-2-
financing for this project (program) should have been confined to the
provision of flood control, some drainage, and a minimum of supplementary
irrigation, and should have followed, rather than anticipated, an effective
program of land acquisition and distribution to the landless peasants".
During presentation of the Second Atlantico Development Project to the Board
of Directors on June 29, 1972, the difference of conclusions between the
appraisal report and the recent OED report was raised by several Directors;
however, the staff assured the Board that the technical assumptions in the
appraisal report were well founded.
1.05          The Project Performance Audit Report (No. 1841) (PPAR) on the
first stage (Loan 502-CO) which was issued on December 28, 1977 concluded
that, because of improper project preparation and appraisal and delays in
project implementation, the economic results of the project (first stage),
were unsatisfactory, but that the project had a positive impact on farming
incomes and living standards of project beneficiaries.
1.06        In April and October 1981, OED missions visited Colombia to
prepare an Impact Evaluation Report (IER) on the first-stage project (Loan
502-CO) because: (a) it was the first Bank-financed irrigation and land
settlement project in Colombia; (b) the implementation time overrun of 57%
had been mostly because of technical problems; and (c) the economic and
social impact of the project had been uncertain at the time the PPAR was
prepared. The IER on the first stage was prepared just as the loan for the
second-stage project (Loan 849-CO) was about to be closed. Therefore, the
conclusions of the IER in Report No. 3959 distributed on June 21, 1982 are of
direct relevance to an evaluation of the second-stage project, in particular
since the IER report treated the areas of loans 502-CO and 849-CO as one
unit.
1.07        In addition to the assessment's of the PPAR (para 1.05), the IER
drew particular attention to the following points:
(a)   information and data provided by the consultants were not
sufficiently reviewed by the Bank or adequately checked for
accuracy, completeness and consistency;
(b)   the Bank's requirement that consultants be responsible for (first
stage) project management was not justified;
(c)   the failure of the production cooperative, promoted by the
consultants, severely dampened the cooperative spirit of settlers
and demonstrated the risk of (i) introducing systems modeled
after those of other countries and not adapted to local
socio-economic conditions; and (ii) developing a settlement
scheme that left little initiative to settlers and which was not
based on a concept of "self-help"; and
(d)   settlers, who were initially considered to be the poorest segment
of the population, turned out to be a privileged group compared
to squatters who entered the project area.



- 3 -
1.08        The Colombian authorities accepted the general conclusions of the
IER, but drew attention to the following issues, which in fact relate to both
stages of the project.:
(a)   the Bank should have taken a more comprehensive view of regional
development, rather than focus on a relatively restrictred
project area;
(b)   as the initial feasibility studies were evidently inadequate, why
did the Bank not redesign the project?
(c)   the Bank should have insisted on the provision of adequate
counterpart financing and included in the project the costs of
operation and maintenance until the whole scheme was in full
operation;
(d)   the Bank should facilitate transfers between loan categories
during project execution so as to make it possible to amend the
project Ln the event of changes in the conditions that were the
basis for the loan;
(e)   the technical problems of draining the project area have still
not been solved;
(f)   the failure (i) to establish an experimental farm; (ii) to
complete the interconnection with the national electrical grid;
and (iii) to overcome the resistance of the local farmers to take
part in any form of cooperative marketing are all points that
should receive attention by the Bank; and
(g)   although the PPAR and IER comment favorably on the positive
impact of the agrarian reform work of INCORA, and report that
living standards for many families are now better than before the
projects, the social situation in the project area is becoming
daily more critical, and serious problems are expected in the
short term, unless Government provides a final solution to the
recurrent flooding problem suffered by the area. This has
reduced the farmers to a subsistence existence, swollen INCORA's
portfolio of bad debts, and made it impossible to recover the
investment made in the civil works.
1.09        The present PCR sets out to respond to some of the questions
raised in the previous paragraphs and to bring out lessons to be learned
by both the Bank and the borrower, particularly from implementation of the
second stage of the Atlantico development program. Details contained in the
reports on the first-stage project (appraisal, PPAR and IER) are not repeated
in this report, which should be read in conjunction with the earlier reports
for a comprehensive overview of the program.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
2.01        The project comprised the second stage of a flood control and
drainage program for an area bounded by the Magdalena River, the Canal del
Dique, the Guajaro Reservoir and the Manati Hills in the Atlantico Department
of Colombia (Map IBRD 3245R3). The project was to complete the development
for settlement and dry farming of about 17,000 ha of cultivable land, of
which about 12,400 ha was expected to be used for crop farming and about
4,600 ha for dairy farming. The 17,000 ha included 6,000 ha protected from
flooding under Loan 502-CO and for which project benefits had been included
in the economic evaluation for Loan 502-CO. The project consisted of the
following components, which were to be completed by the end of 1975:
(a)   design and construction of five main drains (51 km), 31 lateral
drains (60 km), and sublateral ditches and waterways to complete
the drainage for about 17,000 ha, of which 6,000 ha had been
drained during the first stage (Loan 502-CO);
(b)   design and construction or improvement of about 77 km of roads,
including four secondary roads and a number of tertiary roads, to
provide access to the farmland of the project;
(c)   acquisition by INCORA of approximately 17,000 ha;    land
clearance, rough leveling, initial deep plowing and then
allocation of 8 ha each to about 1,800 farmers by 1977, of whom
740 farmers had already been settled on 5,600 ha in the first
stage; INCORA was to treat saline spots that developed after the
final allotments had been made;
(d)   design and construction of five depots, each of about 1,000 m ton
capacity, for the storage of agricultural produce and supplies of
farm inputs;
(e)   expansion of INCORA's headquarters at El Limon in the project
area;
(f) (i) purchase of vehicles and equipment for the operation and
maintenance of facilities constructed under the project; and (ii)
purchase of farm machinery, including about 100 tractors, for use
by about nine private contractors on project lands and to be
supervised by a board formed by INCORA and the Central
Cooperative for Agrarian Reform (CECORA);
(g) (i) the preparation of an agricultural research and extension
program for the project area in close collaboration with the
Colombian Agriculture and Livestock Institute (ICA); and (ii)
evaluation of irrigation trials on the Manati pilot farm which
was to have been established under Loan 502-CO;



(h)   preparation   of a training program for the 1,800 farmers to
be settled within the project area in close collaboration with
the National Training Service (SENA); and
(i)   training for staff of INCORA, totalling 12 man-years, in the
fields of operation and maintenance of flood control and drainage
systems, mechanized dry farming and project administration.
2.02         The description of the project in paragraph 2.01 combines details
given in the Loan Agreement 849-CO'(Schedule 1 and Schedule 2) and in
Appraisal Report PA-84b (paragraphs 5.01 to 5.07; and Annexes 6, 8 and 10)
because the "Description of the Project" in Schedule 2 of the Loan
Agreement,when read alone, does not clearly define the project, particularly
concerning: (a) the participation of private contractors; (b) the carrying
out of irrigation trials; and (c) the extension of the consultancy service
contract.
2.03         The loan for the second-stage project was approved a considerable
time before the first stage (Loan 502-CO) was completed. During the period
in which both loans were effective, it was found that there were funds
available in Loan 502-GO to construct two of the five main drains and 62 km
of the 77 km of roads (Loan 849-CO Category I) and to purchase all the
equipment (Loan 849-CO Category II) included in the second-stage project.
Also during this period, in 1974 the National Planning Department of Colombia
(DNP) established the policy that on-farm land improvement, such as clearing,
leveling, initial plowing and digging sub-lateral or tertiary drains, should
be financed through loans to be taken out by individuals or groups of
farmers. The Agricultural Financing Fund (FFAP) in the Bank of the Republic
(BOR) had resources available for this purpose which were supposed to be
channelled to INCORA's beneficiaries, as well as to other farmers, through
Caja Agraria. Funds from Loan 1357-CO were available for this purpose from
1977 onwards.
2.04         The appraisal estimates of project costs and financing are
summarized in Table 1 and the initial allocation of the proceeds of Loan
849-CO and the projected disbursements schedule are given in Table 2. In
February 1977, the amount of the loan was reduced by US$2.8 million for the
reasons given in paragraph 2.03 and explained in more detail in the following
section. The actual costs and disbursements are also shown in Tables 1 and
2.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Civil Works
3.01        From November 1972, when Loan 849-CO became effective, until the
end of 1975, civil works continued to be financed by Loan 502-CO.
Subsequently, contracts were financed from Loan 849-CO. Construction
proceeded much slower than expected, in part because INCORA did not group all
civil works into no more than four contracts, as required by the Loan
Agreement. I/ The Bank agreed to this change to encourage the development of
1/ Compliance with Loan conditions is summarized in paragraphs 6.02 to 6.04.



- 6 -
small local firms, but unfortunately, on two consecutive occasions,
contractors failed to complete their tasks and work was suspended, each time
for over a year, until the necessary legal steps had been taken to cancel the
contracts and select new contractors. INCORA's capacity to supervise the
contractors was severely limited for the following reasons:
(a)   frequent changes in Project Manager, without the prior agreement
of the Bank to the nomination of the new manager;
(b)   failure of INCORA to continue to employ consultants to assist in
the design, procurement and supervision of construction of the
civil works;  and
(c)   INCORA staff being housed principally in Barranquilla because of
insufficient housing and social facilities in the project area.
3.02        In 1976, the Colombian Institute for Hydrology, Meteorology and
Land Improvement, (HIMAT) received nationwide responsibility for the
construction, operation and maintenance of all civil works within irrigation
and drainage areas. The majority of the works eventually financed from Loan
849-CO were constructed between 1977 and 1979. These totalled 40.2 km of
drains and 23.7 km of roads.
Land Acquisition, Settlement and Development
3.03        During the second-stage project, INCORA purchased 2,068 ha which,
together with the land purchased in the first stage (6,524 ha) and 5,026 ha
reclaimed from former swamplands, but not purchased, brought the total
available for allocation to 13,618 ha (Tables 3 and 4) although not all of
this area was suitable for farming. During the first stage, INCORA had
settled 740 "parceleros," or settlers, on 5,600 ha.    At the conclusion of
the second stage there was a total of 1,252 settlers on 11,262 ha or 70% of
the 1,800 expected at appraisal. In addition, in 1982 there were some 660
unauthorized "squatters" on 1,285 ha, each farming about 2 ha for the
production of subsistence crops from the relatively fertile soils of several
seasonal swamp areas. In the original design, these low zones were to serve
as flood retention areas from which surplus water would eventually be
evacuated through the pumping station "because it was found too costly to
lead all drain water to the main system" (Appraisal Report, Annex 6). At the
conclusion of the second stage of the development program for the project
area, about 9,000 ha remained in about 400 private farms unaffected by
agrarian reform (average 23 ha/farm). The distribution of land ownership
among these farmers is relatively equitable, with few having more than
100 ha.
3.04        INCORA did not carry out the planned initial bush clearing, rough
leveling and deep plowing prior to land allocation, and only about 2,100 km
of tertiary drains were dug out of the estimated requirement for 32,000 km.
This was because the Government decided after loan signature that these works
should be the direct responsiblity of the settlers (para 2.03). The Bank
repeatedly objected to this decision b cause:



- 7 -
(a)   much of this work could be done only by machinery contractors,
who would not be interested in 8-ha units;
(b)   many individual settlers already were in arrears with payments
due to Caja Agraria;
(c)   following the failure of the Caribbean Agricultural and Livestock
Cooperative (CAC), there was even less interest by settlers in
group action;
(d)   in order to make use of funds from the FFAP (para 2.03), Caja
Agraria would require a lien on the settlers' land and this is
prohibited by the Agrarian Reform Law; and
(e)   subsistence farmers tend to avoid risk.    Lack of clear
demonstration that tertiary works would be beneficial resulted
in refusal by farmers to incur further debts to carry out such
works.
3.05        The appraisal foresaw to convert extensive crop farming and
livestock farming (on 58% of the area) into intensive double crop farming and
intensive dairy farming, the latter on a reduced area (27%) (see Table 5).
Poor climatic conditions and soils, however, presented an unacceptable level
of risk, resulting in a steady decline in the area under cultivation (see
Table 6). By 1981, extensive livestock farming occupied 86% of the area and
susbsistence crops 11%.
Storage Depots
3.06        The proposed construction of five farm produce and input storage
depots was cancelled in 1977, following the collapse of CAC and because
private traders were adequately handling the limited agricultural output from
the project area.
Vehicles and Equipment
3.07        All vehicles and equipment planned for the second stage of the
program (Loan 849-CO) were purchased with funds from Loan 502-CO which was
for the first-stage project.
Agricultural Research and Extension
3.08        As part of the first stage project, a pilot farm of about 320 ha
was to be established between Manati and the Guajaro reservoir; 190 ha was to
be for crops and 130 ha for pastures for dairy production. The farm was to
provide facilities to study supplemental irrigation with water from the
Guajaro reservoir and from the drainage system using low-lift mobile pumps.
The farm was not established during the first stage, because ICA was
unwilling to assume additional responsibilities while it had serious
financial problems in operating existing research stations throughout
Colombia, including the sub-station at Santa Lucia in the project area.



- 8 -
During the second stage, even the Santa Lucia sub-station was closed by ICA
as part of its retrenchment program. On several occasions INCORA tried to
prepare with ICA a realistic agricultural research and extension program, but
this was not possible because of the financial problems of ICA and because
the Manati pilot farm had not been established during the first stage
project. The appraisal report (para 6.04) states that "INCORA would be
responsible for agricultural research and extension in the project area, with
technical backstopping from ICA," but there was no financial provision for
these activities in the cost estimates of the project, other than the
equivalent of US$30,000 of local costs for unspecified irrigation studies on
the Manati pilot farm.
Farmers Training Program
3.09         The second stage project did not provide funds for training
farmers, but the Loan Agreement required ICA to draw up a program in
collaboration with SENA. Although INCORA attempted to meet this obligation,
uncertainties about financing the activity and the technical recommendations
to put forward made it very difficult to fulfill. Throughout the execution
of the project, SENA staff conducted short training courses for farmers, but
these inevitably did not constitute a coherent program and the impact of the
courses was not evaluated.
Training INCORA Staff
3.10         During the first stage project, training of INCORA staff had been
carried out in Mexico, Peru, Israel and Iran and it was planned that, during
the second stage, training would be in similar locations, as well as in
Colombia. Early in the execution of the second stage the Government severely
restricted foreign travel by civil servants. INCORA therefore proposed that
the loan funds available for training purposes be used for all types of local
instruction for INCORA staff throughout Colombia. The Bank agreed to this
change and courses were carried out greatly in excess of the equivalent of 12
man-years of instruction, but full details of the courses and an evaluation
of their effectiveness is not available. Only 52% of the amount available for
training had been disbursed at the closing date.
Consultant Services
3.11        At appraisal it was expected that INCORA would renew the contract
with consultants who were assisting in the development of the engineering and
agricultural aspects of the first stage. However, INCORA was not prepared to
extend the contract beyond June 1975, because it considered that the
technical advice during the first stage had not been fully satisfactory and,
in particular, the formation of production cooperatives, promoted by the
consultants, had been ill advised. These views have subsequently received
support in the IER which concluded that, for the first stage, the Bank's
requirement for consultants to be responsible for project management was
notjustified. However, as noted in paragraph 3.01 (b), the lack of
experienced civil engineering consultants was one factor contributing to the
erratic and slow completion of the drainage system during the second-stage
project.



IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01        The Atlantico regional office of INCORA was responsible for
managing the whole project and also the Repelon irrigation scheme to the West
of the Guajaro reservoir and some other areas to the North of the project
area. The periodic reports and studies prepared by the office were generally
on a regional basis so that it is almost impossible to isolate the costs and
benefits attributable to Loans 502-CO and 849-CO. Within the project area,
INCORA staff was not able to obtain technical or quantitative information
from individual private farmers, occupying 9,000 ha, who continued to believe
that such enquiries were the initial stage of expropriation proceedings.
4.02        The project was implemented while the future role of INCORA and
official policies for agrarian reform and settlement were under continuing
but inconclusive debate. Funds for the institution were curtailed and this
caused particular problems for the Atlantico project, which had a lower
priority than many other INCORA projects. The project also suffered from
frequent changes in management; there were five managers in the period
1973-81.
4.03        At the height of its operations in the Atlantico region, INCORA
had over 300 employees, including laborers, and even in 1977, by which time
HIMAT had taken over responsibility for all civil works construction and
maintenance, INCORA slill employed 288 persons for the stage 1 and 2 project
areas, and for the Repelon scheme. In 1981, total recurrent expenditures of
INCORA and HIMAT for the project area of Loan 849-CO, excluding
meteorological services, were about Col$ 20.0 million ((US$364,000) and
Col$ 31.8 million (US',578,000), respectively. For the 21,547 ha occupied by
settlers, squatters and other farmers (Table 4), the HIMAT expenditures for
operation and maintenance were equivalent to Col$ 1,476/ha or about
US$27/ha. This cost Should be compared with the official annual drainage
charge in 1982, which was equivalent to about US$6/ha although in fact no
charges have been collected yet because farmers refuse to pay for what they
consider to be an unsatisfactory service. The main operational expenditures
of HIMAT are for the operation of the drainage pumping station at Boquitas,
the removal of aquatic weeds and silt from the drainage ditches, and roads
maintenance. Restrict:ions on HIMAT's operational budget have lead to
inadequate maintenance and a serious deterioration in the condition of the
drainage system. Until adequate funds are provided to HIMAT for operations
and maintenance expenditures, it is improbable that there will be any
improvement in the collection of drainage charges.
4.04        Under the project, but not financed from Loan 849-CO, at full
development INCORA was to provide Col$ 58 million of production credit per
season and, in addition, the Government was to make arrangements to provide
dairy farmers in the project area with long-term credit totalling about Col$
47 million. The supervised credit operation was not satisfactory throughout
the implementation of the second stage. An important reason for this
failure, as has been noted in the IER, was that as late as 1981 a number of
previous CAC members were still not eligible for agricultural credit because
of debts they had cont:racted, but never reimbursed to Caja Agraria after CAC



- 10 -
collapsed. Settlers were supposed to sell their harvests through CAC, which
would thus be in a position to recover its advances for the inputs. Instead,
settlers either sold their harvests individually or left the cooperative
before repaying their debts. As a result, CAC collapsed in 1977. The
appraisal mission did not study this matter sufficiently to design a workable
solution (para 6.06). During supervision, INCORA was asked to analyze the
credit status of each settler, but by the time this review was completed in
1979, Caja Agraria was not prepared to extend new loans in the project area
using its own funds and the Government was not prepared to provide additional
resources for this purpose.
4.05        External audit reports were received from the Comptroller General
of the Republic for each year up to 1980, but they were invariably extremely
late. From 1977 the opinions were adverse, principally because there was no
clear partition of the assets of the project between INCORA and HIMAT. There
were, however, other material accounting weaknesses that had not been
resolved when the loan closed, but which are being addressed with the help of
consultants financed from Loan 1163-CO.
V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RETURNS
5.01        Estimation of the physical production changes and economic and
financial returns directly or indirectly attributable to Loan 849-CO is
complicated by a number of factors. First, a large part of the area has
benefitted from civil works undertaken under Loan 502-CO, 50% of which was
disbursed after Loan 849-CO was initiated. Second, the project area has
received a large, but unquantified, windfall gain as a result of the paving
of two major access highways from the North. Third, the stimulus to invest
in dairy operations since removal of price control on milk in 1979 must be
judged as very considerable. The combination of these factors leaves a wide
margin for interpreting the "without project" situation over the period
1973-92.
Financial Returns
5.02   As of the date of project initiation (1973), INCORA, through Caja
Agraria, was engaged in an active credit program to support commercial
cropping activities within the project area. In 1972, 928 INCORA settlers
had 2,750 ha under commercial crops and about 1,000 ha in subsistence crops.
In addition, 450 private farmers, located on better soils, had 4,250 ha in
commercial crops. No information is available on credit and financial
performance of the private farmers, but their interest in pursuing risky dry
land farming is attributed to high potential profits to be obtained from
cotton during the early 1970s. At the outset of Loan 849-CO, the incentive
for INCORA settlers to engage in extremely risky dryland cropping operations
was attributable to the close involvement of the consultants in the
management of CAC, supported by a poorly managed credit program. The farmers
were acting as laborers for the cooperative, with their wages being
guaranteed while cultivating crops at a loss. The debts they incurred
through production credit were accumulated on their behalf by CAC. At the
date of project start-up, settlers were already in arrears on credit by



- 11 -
approximately Col$ 40 million (US$2 million, 1972 equivalent). By 1977,
outstanding credit to both private farmers and settlers in the project area
of Loan 849-CO over the period 1973-77 amounted to Col$ 74 million, of which
Col$ 44 million was in default as of the end of 1977. These figures do not
include credit granted to settlers who had abandoned approximately 2,700 ha
between 1972 and 1976, many of them leaving for Venezuela.
5.03        There is no record of total credit default within the project
area. INCORA records show new credit issued to December 1981 of Col$ 80
million with repayment of principal and interest amounting to Col$ 37
million. With the dissolution of the bankrupt CAC cooperative in 1977, it
must be assumed that all outstanding credit at that time was written off.
Further, even where repayments have been made, annual inflation rates in the
order of 25%, restructuring of part of the outstanding debt in 1979 with a 1%
interest rate and numerous extensions to the repayment dates, indicate very
substantial financial losses to the Government credit institutions.
5.04        At appraisal it was projected that net annual farm income for
INCORA settlers would increase from US$900 in 1973, to a range of US$2,700 to
US$4,300 in 1982. These figures are expressed in 1981 dollars and are before
tax but net of project charges (US$350 per year) and debt service. Since
in reality settlers did not pay project charges and in the majority of cases
did not repay their debts, their financial returns immediately before the
project and until the collapse of the CAC in 1977 were probably considerably
higher than official estimates. After 1977 easy credit was no longer
available through the INCORA-CAC-Caja Agraria channel (paras 5.02 and 5.03),
but settlers were able to obtain livestock credit through Banco Ganadero, the
Livestock Credit Bank, which has a lien on cattle purchased with its loans.
This further accelerated the conversion from crop farming to livestock
farming, but under better controlled credit. On the assumption that credit
recovery will be substantially higher in the future, the financial status of
the average settler is projected to be only little better than in the "before
project" situation and for 1982, before tax, net farm income after project
charges and debt service is projected to range between US$1,000 to US$1,400
(see Tables 6, 8 and 9).
5.05        In absence of the civil works provided under Loan 849-CO, about
2,000 ha less land would have been reclaimed and 250 fewer settlers would
have received an allotment. However, without the project, the average return
to the 1,000 rather than 1,250 settlers families between 1982-92, would
probably have been within 90% of the "with project" range. Gross incomes
have varied widely over the 1972-81 period due to drought, flood losses and
price fluctuations (see Table 7).
5.06        The situation for squatters on private and INCORA lands was even
less favorable than for settlers. Their number increased from 400 to 660
over the 10-year period, but the net value of subsistence crops per family in
1981 dollars remained roughly constant at US$300 to US$600, but with wide
variability.



- 12 -
5.07        The number of private farmers in the project area declined from
450 to 400 between 1972 and 1981. By 1979, the excessive risk of crop
farming had resulted in a 100% conversion from mixed farming to livestock
farming (see Table 6). No projection was made at appraisal of improvement in
income for private farmers in the area affected by drainage and flood control
works. Their incomes in 1973 are assumed to be of the same order of
magnitude as the settlers at that date (para 5.04).    For the period 1982-92,
net farm returns from their livestock operations are projected at US$2,000 to
US$2,500, compared with US$1,300 to US$1,600 "without" the project (Table 9).
5.08        Although there are difficulties in comparing estimates made in
1971 and 1982 because of changing price assumptions and conversion of nominal
pesos and dollars to constant values, some indications of the changed
expectations for the project between appraisal and completion can be gauged
from the following: at appraisal the annual gross value of production was
expected to increase from US$4.2 million (1981 dollars) in 1972 to US$23.4
million by 1990, with the net value increasing from US$1.7 million to US$8.9
million. At completion these projections for 1990 were US$5.9 million for
the gross value and US$2.4 million for the net value of production, or 27% of
the appraisal estimate. (Table 10).
5.09        The expected increases in production without the project are
based on the assumption that credit would have been available through Banco
Ganadero and that livestock output would have expanded in response to
improved highway access to the project boundary, a general improvement
of technology and favorable prices for milk.
Economic Return
5.10        The estimated economic rate of return has been based on the
following assumptions:
(a)   project costs and benefits are reflected by market prices, i.e.,
a standard conversion factor of one;
(b)   all family labor was valued at the prevailing market rate (Table
11);
(c)   all expenditures under Loan 502-CO were taken as sunk
costs. Thus, contrary to normal procedure, even expenditures
under Loan 502-CO incurred over the period 1973-76, which could
directly or indirectly have affected agricultural production
conditions on the Loan 849-CO project area, were excluded from
the cost stream. However, operation and maintenance costs for
all infrastructure financed by Loan 502-CO, outside the
irrigation area, was included as a cost to the second-stage
project;
(d)   both costs and benefits for the 6,000 ha, which had already been
developed under Loan 502-CO, were included in the calculations
(para 2.01);



- 13 -
(e)   INCORA land acquisition expenditures were excluded, but the
project-imputed operational costs of INCORA and HIMAT for
administration and maintenance expenses were included as costs;
and
(f)   project life was taken as 20 years with incremental herd value
added as a benefit in year 20. (Table 11).
5.11         Based on these assumptions, the benefit stream is negative in all
years, except year 20. Expressed in current prices, the net present value
(NPV) is minus Col$ 95 million (US$14 million) at a 12% discount rate or,
when expressed in 1981 currency, minus Col$ 170 million (US$23 million). The
only component affecting net benefits to any significant extent is the cost
attributed to family labor; even with this component valued at zero, the NPV
remains negative.
5.12      The poor economic performance must be attributed to:
(a)   the substantial shortfall in high value crop production;
(b)   the relatively satisfactory performance of livestock farming in the
project area which is expected to have prevailed even in the
absence of the project; and
(c) the excessive costs of administration, operation and maintenance for
civil works which, apart from roads, are believed to have had
limited impact on livestock and subsistence cropping operations,
jointly accounting for over 95% of production from the project
area.
5.13      For the year 1981 the total cost of administration, operation and
maintenance by INCORA and HIMAT was estimated at Col$ 51.8 million (para
4.03). For the same year, the net incremental benefits attributed to the
project are projected as Col$ 24.5 million (Table 10). Some possibility for
improvement does exist. In the first place, government's recurrent
expenditures can be reduced and in the second place, the present coefficients
of animal production are so low (Table 12) that a reasonable potential for
increased production exists (para 7.10).
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND THE BANK
Performance of the Borrower
6.01      The Government, which was the Borrower, did not provide INCORA with
the funds necessary to carry out the project as designed and, furthermore,
did not authorize expenditures necessary for the regular maintenance (a) by
INCORA and later by HIMAT, of the roads and drains in the project area; (b)
by the local Government authority responsible for access roads to the project
area (Loan Agreement: 4.01 (c)); and (c) the electricity authority which was
to have completed the interconnection between the national grid and the
pumping stations.

Compliance with Loan Conditions
6.02        The appraisal report drew attention to the following principal
points on which agreement was reached during loan negotiations.    Reference
is made below to the relevant paragraphs in the appraisal report (AR), the
Loan Agreement (LA) and the present report (PCR):
(a)     INCORA would let a maximum of four contracts for drains and
would promptly issue import licenses for imported equipment
and materials (AR, 5.1; LA, Schedule 4, (i); and PCR, 3.01);
(b)     within one year of the effective date of the loan, INCORA would
prepare and submit to the Bank for review, programs on: (i)
agricultural research and extension; and (ii) training of
Atlantico Stage II farmers and would then implement such programs
(AR, 6.06; LA, 3.02(b) and Schedule 2 (f); and PCR, 3.07 and
3.08);
(c)     Government would submit to the Bank for comment a training
schedule for INCORA personnel, giving details of individual
training assignments before undertaking work (AR, 5.07; LA,
Schedule 2 (g); and PCR, 3.09);
(d)     Government would levy a charge sufficient to cover operation and
maintenance costs of the project and as much of the capital
expenditures as feasible (AR, 6.12; LA, 4.03; and PCR, 4.03); and
(e)     Government would make adequate funds available to provide
long-term credit to establish dairy farms and seasonal credit for
settlers ("parceleros") (AR, 6.10; LA, 4.04 (ii); and PCR,
4.04).
6.03        Other important loan conditions were as follows:
(a)     before making any appointment to the position of Project Manager,
INCORA would inform the Bank of names, experience and
qualifications and afford the Bank reasonable opportunity to
comment (AR, 6.01; LA, 3.02 (f); and PCR, 3.01 (a) and 4.02);
(b)     Government would make available to INCORA promptly, as needed,
all funds required to carry out the project, including the
proceeds of the loan (AR, 5.11; LA, 3.02 (a); and PCR, 4.02 and
4.03);
(c)     Government would cause INCORA to operate and maintain adequately
the flood control and drainage facilities, roads, buildings and
equipment (AR, 6.01;  LA, 4.01 (b); and PCR, 4.03); and
(d)     INCORA would have its project account audited and, not later than
four months after the end of each fiscal year, would furnish the
Bank certified copies of the audited accounts, as well as the
auditor's report (AR, 5.14; LA, 3.02 (k); and PCR, 4.05).



- 15 -
6.04        As has been indicated in the corresponding paragraphs of this
report, the Borrower and INCORA were not in full compliance with any of
the principal agreements reached during negotiations and recorded as loan
conditions.
Performance of the Bank
6.05      The civil engineering specifications proposed by the appraisal
mission, except for drains M and I, were appropriate to the economic
potential of the area, but the agronomic proposals were unrealistic, although
they appeared to justify the expenditures on civil works. More attention
should have been given at appraisal to the integration of the Atlantico 2
development program into the development activities in the region. During
implementation it was soon realized that livestock production would continue
to be the predominant activity in the area, but the Bank did not explain
effectively to INCORA that (a) if settlers were to depend on livestock, then
land allotments would have to be considerably more than 8 ha/family; and (b)
squatters must be prohibited from sowing crops in depressions which were
designed to serve as temporary water storage areas.
6.06      Consistent with many other early irrigation and drainage projects
financed by the Bank, at appraisal attention was paid only to civil works.
The design of this project did not relate the project to a regional
development plan (para 1.08 (a)) and did not pay sufficient attention to the
complementary institutions and services (credit and inputs; research,training
and extension; and storage and marketing) that would be critical to the
successful implementation of the drainage and land improvement project.
6.07        All these problems were well known by 1977 when US$2.8 million of
the loan was cancelled, but the Bank did not take this opportunity to require
INCORA to redesign the project (para 1.08 (b)) because, at that time, the
Government provided insufficient political or financial support for INCORA,
which showed little interest in the Atlantico 2 project.
VII. SPECIAL ISSUES AND LESSONS LEARNED
Farming System
7.01        The farming system planned at appraisal to be established
throughout the project area, depended principally on double-cropping (para
1.03 and Table 5). This proposal was based on an insufficient understanding
of the local physical and social environment. The soils, the climate and the
history of the communities of former fishermen have together presented a
particularly difficult combination of circumstances throughout the
implementation of both stages of the Atlantico development program. The
soils of the area are of marine origin with salinity and alkalinity
increasing with depth, as well as localized saline surface patches
distributed throughout the area. The soils most suitable for crop production
are located in depressions that were formerly swamps and which are still
liable to seasonal flooding (para 7.10).



- 16 -
Rainfall distribution does not favor double-cropping without
irrigation because there is a long severe dry season and, even in the
normally wet season, serious droughts have occurred (Chart). Rainfall is
often intense and may be localized over a part of the project area where it
can cause heavy damage, unless the fields are graded and drained to prevent
the crops from being waterlogged.
7.02      Execution of on-farm improvement works, such as land leveling and
construction of tertiary ditches, should not be delegated to the
responsibility of individual farmers (para 3.04). Most of them will avoid
the risk of engaging debts for long range benefits, which are beyond their
customary horizon of providing immediate security. Therefore, such works
should form part of the project facilities to be executed by the
authorities. The arguments in favor of this are that it provides the means
to achieve as rapidly as possible the economic goal of full production, as
well as the financial goal of farmers being able to pay their operation and
maintenance charges at an early stage.
7.03      As was realized at appraisal, farm mechanization is essential in
the area to prepare the land rapidly in the short period during which
the soils are cultivable. However, private contractors were not prepared to
continue land preparation as they were not paid promptly through CAC. CAC
itself was not capable of maintaining and operating the machinery pool
established under both projects, mainly because of its financial collapse
resulting from its members failing to pay what they owed CAC and, hence,
Caja Agraria (para 4.04). Other constraints were late or inadequate land
preparation, unreliability of seed quality, and unavailability of fertilizers
and plant protection products in sufficient quantity. Between 1972 and 1982
there was a steady decline in the area under cultivation by settlers and
private farmers (Table 6), who were increasingly unwilling and unable to
continue with crop farming, which represented to them an unacceptable level
of risk.
7.04      Even when the Bank Loan does not include provision of agricultural
credit, the general credit situation of project beneficiaries should be
investigated during appraisal (paras 5.02 and 6.06).
7.05      It proved to be a failure to introduce a foreign type of
cooperative. This experiment has alienated farmers to participate in any
further cooperative arrangements (para 5.02).
Drainage System
7.06      No provision was made for adequate allocations for operation and
maintenance during construction and until the time when incremental project
benefits start to accrue to the farmers (para 6.01). Colombian regulations
prevented such provisions.
7.07      Reliance upon diesel power for large pumping plants requires a
sophisticated organization for maintenance and fuel supply. Electric power
companies are usually safer and cheaper providers of energy. The Bank should
include in its loan agreements conditions to assure timely connection to the
national grid (para 1.08).



- 17 -
7.08      In the feasibility study of the second-stage project, based on a
60 mm storm in 24 hours affecting the whole area, it was proposed that the
nominal installed capacity of the Boquitas pumping station should be
increased from 5 m3/sec to 20 m3/sec to serve the whole area. This
would have required a major modification to drain 'M' to increase its
discharge capacity as well as installation of additional pumps at Boquitas.
The appraisal mission considered,that a more economical solution would be to
retain the installed pumping station capacity of 5 m3/sec and to use four
depressions as retention areas from which water would evaporate in addition
to the large Boquitas swamp, which would serve as a buffer reservoir from
which the water would eventually be evacuated through the pumping station.
Between 1970 and 1979 the 60 mm design storm was exceeded on 22 occasions and
in November 1979, after 171 mm had fallen in two days, there was a breach in
the western interceptor which led to serious flooding causing extensive crop
damage and civil disorders among the settlers. Before the flood diversion
works were constructed during the first-stage project, about 8,000 ha were
inundated annually. At the conclusion of the second stage, the area
regularly flooded is 1,500 ha to 2,000 ha, except following the storm in
1979. The areas still liable to seasonal flooding are: (a) close to the main
drain 'M' upstream of the Boquitas reservoir; and (b) small depressions
scattered throughout the project area. The Boquitas pumps were operating at
about 70% of their nominal capacity of 5 m3/sec in 1982, indicating that they
were badly worn. However, these pumps were still capable of withdrawing
water faster than it can flow down drains I and M for which both the initial
design and routine maintenance has been inadequate.
7.09      After the 1979 floods, HIMAT engaged consultants to review the
whole drainage system. The Bank agreed to extend the loan closing date until
September 1981 to permit the study to be completed. Using a runoff
coefficient of 60%, the consultants recommended an additional main drain and
a second drainage pumping station at a total cost of US$(1981)6.4 million.
In effect, the consultants reverted to the recommendations of the feasibility
study. On the basis of information on rainfall and volume of water pumped
from 1979 to 1981 (Table 13), it is estimated that the monthly maximum
corrected runoff removed was about 13% of rainfall volume. This apparently
low percentage was sufficient, under all but exceptional circumstances, to
prevent prolonged flooding because of the massive storage capacity of the
scattered low depressions which resulted from the lack of land improvement
works. Under the original plan for field crops, land leveling was supposed
to eliminate such spots. With the present land use for grazing, however,
they are beneficial in providing additional moisture to support pastures for
the dry season. It is expected that the project area will continue to be
used predominantly for livestock, which benefit from dry season grazing in
the seasonally flooded depressions. It is concluded, therefore, that the
runoff coefficient used by the consultants was unrealistically high, since it
is most unlikely that it will ever be agronomically feasible to devote the
majority of the project area to crops as envisaged at appraisal.



- 18 -
7.10      During the preparation of this report, the Bank provided
suggestions to HIMAT for low cost solutions for the various drainage
problems.   These consist mainly of increasing the capacities of the main
drains M and I to match the maximum possible capacity of the Boquitas pumping
station, in which the pumps will have to be renewed. A small sub-pumping
station should be installed near Manati to drain the 800 ha of best soils
located around drain IV. Furthermore, INCORA's cost of administration should
be reduced by limiting its staff to only those who are required to improving
agricultural production in the area. Since livestock farming is the
predominant activity and since its present level of productivity is extremely
low, it is clear that INCORA should focus its extension effort in this field
(para 5.13).

Subject: Completion Reports on Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage Project
(IBRD Loan 738-CO) and Second Atlantico Development Project
(IBRD Loan 849-co)
Dear Mr. Kapur:
I am pleased to inform you that the referenced documents can generally
be said to present the essential conditions that prevailed during execution of
the projects in question; as a result, I regard these documents as satisfactory
and not in need of any amendment.
Despite the foregoing, and with a view to improving the execution of
future projects, I feel that it is important to bear in mind the conclusions
of the reports, namely that conditions, goals, period of execution, adminis-
tration and evaluation be made more realistic by employing more pragmatic
assumptions.  As a consequence, the National Government is prepared to extend
to the Bank whatever assistance it requires to ensure better execution of future
projects and so secure increased social benefits for the regions in question.
Finally, I feel that the greatest importance should be attached to comments
in this regard by the project executing agencies, as they are the bodies best
placed to assess the results, both technical and financial, of the projects and
the lessons to be drawm from them.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur

Subject: Project Completion Report for Loan 849-CO
Dear Mr. Kapur:
The Project Completion Report for Loan 849-CO prepared by the Bank's
Operations Evaluation Department is in general satisfactory, although I would
note the following:
1.       BACKGROUND
From the standpoint of development, Loan 849-CO was neither
sufficient nor adequate for local conditions and the beneficiaries. The loan
should have included:
- construction of schools and health posts
- farming and/or livestock credit, i.e. in the form of an integrated
development project.
2.       FEASIBILITY STUDY
The consultants were overly optimistic as regards project feasibility
and the results were expected within a very short time frame.
3.       ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Para. 4.03 states that INCORA employed 288 persons for the stage
1 and 2 project areas, and for the Repelon scheme. That figure should be
correct_d to 110, which is the correct number.
Para. 7.10 states that "INCORA's cost of administration should be
reduced..."



- 21 -                               Annex 1
Page 3
The idea is not to reduce, but rather to transfer employees from
other areas to stage 2 in order to increase the number of livestock
technicians, as stockraising is the predominant activity. In addition, it
should be noted that the number of employees in Atlantico remained at an
average of 100 throughout the last five years.
4.       CREDIT OPERATIONS
In late 1982 INCORA's Boar,d of Directors approved a Col$26 million
portfolio operation, benefiting 423 borrowers, who remained eligible for
additional credits, which they are in fact receiving.
5.       MAINTENANCE AND CONSERVATION
The maintenance and conservation of the drainage works changed very
significantly during the last four months of 1982 and the early months of
1983. HIMAT has worked resolutely to make the necessary resources available
to normalize drainage service in the area and thereby avoid flooding. The
inhabitants of the region are very satisfied with HIMAT's performance and have
said so in writing.
As the 1979 floods were caused by rainfall that exceeded all
forecasts, the government authorities working in the area cannot be blamed.
6.       BENEFITS OF THE LOAN
Despite all the difficulties that arose during the implementation of
Loan 849-CO we must stress the transformation that has taken place in the
target area. It is true that the projected parameters or indicators have not
been achieved, but direct and indirect benefits have been felt in all respects.
Conditions are now favorable for the credit operations and it is safe
to say that there is no threat of flooding in the area.
Yours truly,
/s/ Natividad Daza Casilimas
Deputy Manager for Planning
