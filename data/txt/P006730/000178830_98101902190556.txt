INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PREuIDENT TO TME EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE SECOND ATLANTICO DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and reconmendation on a proposed
loan to the Republiz of Colombia for use by the Colombian InstituCe for
Agrarian Reform (INChOa) for the equivalent of US$5 million for an agri-
cultural development project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including 6 years of grace, with an interest rate of 7-1/4 pement per
annum.
PART I - THE EC3NOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia, R-72-21) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on January- 24, 1972. The next Bank mission to assess the Colombian economic
situation is scheduled for September-October of this year. My Report and
Recommendation (P-1076) dated May 31, 1972, which was distributed in connec-
tion with a proposed development program and export expansion loan, gave
recent information on the Colombian economy and its prospects, and a
conclusion concerning Colombia's creditworthiness for additional external
borrowing. (For the relevant sections of that report, see Annex II, pages
2-7 attached. Page 8 of the annex includes a table showing the main sources
of external financing for Colombia for the period 1963-71).
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
3.        The proposed loan, which would be the fiftieth made to Colombia,
would bring the total amount of Bank loans to that country--including the
Development Program and Export Expansion loan--to US$932.9 millipn
(net of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, US$719.9 million is
now held by the Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$1965 million for
highways in Colombia. Historically, the majority of Bank loans to Colombia
have been in the electric power and transportation sectors, although begin-
ning in 1966 an increasing share of the loans has been for agriculture,
industry and telecommunications, and more recently, for education and water
supply. Disbursements have been completed on twenty-five loans and the one
IDA credit. Of the twenty-three with undisbursed balances, progress on the
majority is satisfactory. IFG has made investment and underwriting commit-
ments in 18 enterprises in Colombia, totalling US$19.7 million of which IFC



-2-
now holds US$10.4 million. Annex I-contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, the IDA credit, and IFn investments as of April 30, 1972, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects with particular reference to
those which are encountering problems in execution and giving rise to
delays in disbursements.
4.        Fbr FY 1973, we are proceeding with an active lending program
for Colombia. The staff has recently appraised a medium-size cities
water supply and sewerage project, a sixth railway project, a fifth
development finance companies project, and the Guatape II hydroelectric
project. I hope to be able to recommend loans for most, if not all, of
these projects during the next six months. In addition, loans are under
preparation fo'r' presentation in the latter part of FY 1973 for a third
education project and a second Caqueta land colonization project.
5.        Over the past few years, Bank lending in Colombia has become
increasingly diversified. In earlier years, the Bank focussed primarily
on power and transport. As Bank activities in Colombia expanded and as
the Bank assumed increasing responsibilities as head of the Consultative
Group for Colombia, it has moved increasingly into industry, agriculture
and the social, sectors. In formulating conditions for lending and in
selecting fields'of activity, we have been motivated by the'following
principal considerations: (a) to provide capital for high-priority sectors
where other sources of external finance have been'difficult to mobilize;
(b) to assist the Colombians in obtaining capital from other sources on
adequate term's;'(c) to contribute to important institution-building
objectives, including the development of an improved fiscal system and
institutions capable of increasing public savings; (d) to give support to
governmental programs and projects designed to remove the balance of
payments"'constraint on accelerated economic development; an*d (e) to
associate the Bank'increasingly with the efforts of the Colombian Govern-
ment to distribute the benefits of economic progress more widely.
6.        In accordance with these considerations, we expect over the
next few years to make a substantial contribution to the expansion of
agriculture and industry, with perhaps as much as 60 percent of our total
lending in those two sectors.' We would hope that through our lending in
agriculture we shall be able to assist',in tackling the problems of the
lower income groups in the rural sector.   A major objective in both fields
will be to-continue tb help remove the balance of payments constraint on
development. We.'shall be continuing with additional-projects in education
and water supply where we have important institution-building objectives,
as well as providing direct support to Government efforts to provide
widening opportunities for the development of human capacities, and for
broadening the geographical-distribution of the benefits of economic growth.
While our future lending for transport and power will be significant, we
would hope progressively2to encourage other members of the Consultative
Group to assume a growing role in these fields.



-3-
7.        The Colombian Government has recently prepared guidelines for
a revision of its development program, to give increased emphasis to
urban development, to balanced regional growth, and to stimulate a pattern
of demand which will maximize' employment opportunities. The planning
authorities in Colombia hope that a program can be formulated that will
better serve the needs of the lower income groups. One of the principal
elements of this program is to stimulate urban housing. We shall maintain
close contact with the Colombian authorities to adjust our own lending
program to the changes which emerge from the current re-evaluation.
PART III - THE AGRICUTURE SECTOR
8.        An exceptional regional diversity in soils and climates makes it
possible for Colombia to produce a wide range of agricultural commodities
for home consumption and export. In recent years government policy has
been successful in making use.of the country's potential to diversify
agricultural output and reduce the excessive dependence on coffee. In
1965 coffee accounted for 63 percent of exports, while in 1971 the propor-
tion had fallen to about 53 percent. More than half of Colombia's non-
traditional exports are now accounted for by agricultural products, and
its agricultural trade balance (other than coffee), which averaged a
negative US$25 million per annum from 1960 to 1965, became a positive
US$65 million in 1970. The drive to increase non-traditional exports
could not have succeeded without a strong overall rate of growth in the
agricultural sector which averaged 4.8 percent in real terms during the
period 1965-70, as compared with a rate of 2.7 percent for the previous
5-year period. (For Latin America, as a whole, agricultural growth for
the 1965-70 period averaged about 2 percent p.a.) Growth declined to
2.4 percent in 1971 because of heavy rains and flood damage, but prelimi-
nary information for 1972 indicates that the sector has resumed its previous
rate of growth.
9.        Despite recent favorable growth performance, the sector is
confronted with serious structural problems. Average per capita income
in rural areas is only half the level of urban incomes, and income distribu-
tion is very skewed with the poorest 50 percent of the rural population
receiving only 16.5 percent of total rural incomes. The distribution of
income is related to the concentration of land ownership: the 1960 census
showed that the largest ten percent of farms accounted for 81 percent of
all farm land. The quality of the land varies greatly, and while some of
the large holdings are good arable land, many are not. Government actions
since the establishment of INCORA in 1961 have been aimed at lessening the
concentration, through the claiming for public domain of unused land, through
irrigation and subsequent redistribution in some districts, and through
resettlement projects. There has been little outright redistribution of good
land.
10.       Agriculture employs some 41 percent of the Colombian labor force,
and while open unemployment has been estimated at no more than 2 percent,
underemployment and seasonal unemployment together may raise the overall
average for the sector to as high as 30 percent.



11.       The Colombian authorities have became increasingly aware that
the situation can be improved only by a resolute policy of' agricultural
development coupled with accelerated agrarian reform. In the past, reform
policy followed the moderate lines envisaged by the framers of the 1961
Agrarian Reform Law, and was designed with a view to improving the lot
of the small farmer without sacrificing production. Primary emphasis was
placed upon the developmental aspect of agricultural policy rather than
upon land redistribution. As the agency responsible for land tenure issues,
INCORA has claimed for the public domain some 3.5 million hectares of
privately-owned land that had gone unused for a period of ten years or
more. At the same time, INCORA had granted by the end of 1971 some
120,000 titles for 3.6 million hectares of effectively occupied and
cultivated public lands. These lands were mainly in new frontier regions
such as the Llanos and the Caqueta, where the Bank is assisting with a land
settlement project (Loan 739-CO). In contrast to this, only 270,000 hectares
of farmland had been purchased from private landowners for INCORA's own
projects, and about half of this had been redistributed to some 8,000
land reform beneficiaries by the end of 1971. Since amendment of the
Agrarian Reform Law in 1968, sharecroppers and tenant farmers have been
able to claim title to the land they farm, and nearly 80,000 of them have
applied to INCORA. Of these, some 45,000 have had the legitimacy of their
claims recognized by INCORA and are thus eligible to receive supervised
credit.
12.       Recently, a new phase of land reform policies has been initiated
by the agrarian reform bill now before the Colombian Congress. This bill
has three main purposes: first, to improve substantially compensation for
expropriation of well cultivated land, and thus dispel insecurity among
landowners ready to embark upon substantial agricultural investment programs;
second, to make it much easier for INCORA to purchase land which is inade-
quately worked; and third, to establish a National Village Welfare Fund
which would operate Rural Centers, systematically providing the dispersed
rural population with such social services as health, education and technical
assistance. It is envisaged that in addition to INCORA, a number of
government agencies--the Ministries of Health and Education; the. government
marketing agency for agricultural produce (IDEMA); the agricultural research
and extension agency (ICA); and the agency for technical and adult education
(SENA)--will coordinate their activities through these Rural Centers.  A
proposed third Bank loan for education, scheduled for presentation in FY 1973,
would include a component for these centers.
13.       Coffee diversification remains a key element of Colombian agri-
cultural policy. For many years the Federation of Coffee Growers has
operated a diversification program aimed at restraining increases in the
areas planted with coffee and encouraging coffee growers to expand produc-
tion of other agricultural commodities. A recent evaluation of this program
at the farm level by the Inter-American Development Bank showed that
beneficiaries of the program had cut back the dominance of coffee, which



previously constituted 78 percent of their total production, to
60 percent in 1970. Since coffee is typically a product of very small
farms, the future of coffee diversification is closely bound up with
the Government's general policy concerning farms too small to yield an
adequate family income ("minifundia"). The new agrarian reform legisla-
tion indicates that the Government's intention is to make greater use of
cooperative farming as an instrument for consolidating the minifundia
and rationalizing their production.
14.       To assemble a major portion of small holdings into productive
family farm units, or to make it feasible for large numbers of farmers to
move to new areas, would require massive inputs of credit and technical
assistance. To help meet this problem, the Government has adjusted its
agricultural credit policies more and more with the small farmer in mind.
For example, an analysis of the lending strategy of the Caja Agraria,
by far Colombia's largest lending institution in the sector, shows that
in recent years it is progressively lending more to small farmers, and
a new regulation of the Monetary Board permits it to lend to bona fide
farmers who are unable to produce land title as collateral.
15.       In addition to credit facilities and technical assistance,
marketing of agricultural products would have to be substantially
improved in order to promote the welfare of small farmers. In this
connection, the Government's proposed restructuring of IDEMA will shift
its activities from retailing to wholesaling, and this should enable it
to fulfill more effectively its function of stabilizing the market for
agricultural produce.
16.       Another important element in the Government's agricultural
development policy has been its program of resettlement projects, of
which there are now 12 in operation. These projects seek to increase
total farmland available by bringing previously uncultivated lands into
production. Complementary to colonization are the irrigation projects,
which now number 15 and which usually include land reclamation and flood
control as subsidiary objectives. The Atlantico project before you is
typical in this respect. Also there are some 20 projects of land division
and redistribution which aim at transforming tenant farmers or share-
croppers into independent landowners by giving them titles to land worked
and credit facilities to launch them into independent production.
17.       The IDB, through recent loans for the Agricultural Research
and Extension Agency (ICA), and AID, through its agricultural sector
loans, have provided financing for improvements in research and extension
services and can be expected to continue to do so. To help meet the
credit needs of small farmers, AID has devoted a substantial portion of
the resources of recent agricultural sector loans to supervised credit
for beneficiaries of the agrarian reform program.



-6-
18.        Given the scope of the problems, and as technical assistance
capacity develops further, there should be much need for future Bank
lending in the agricultural sector. Future loans would, of course, try
to contribute further to the expansion of research, extension, and to
training of agricultural technicians. Bank lending would also be guided
by several of the key elements of the overall lending strategy for
Colombia discussed in Part II, above: we would seek to include lending
for small farmers while continuing to aim at increasing yields and
outputs; to contribute to a further reduction in Colombia's dependence
on coffee; and to help strengthen the Colombian institutions that implement
Bank-financed projects. We have moved increasingly into the agricultural
sector in the recent past, and we expect to make a substantial contribution
to further expansion over the next few years, with perhaps as much as one-
third of our'total lending to be made in the agricultural sector.
19.        The Bank recently sent a mission to examine the special problems
of agricultural development and the Government's policies in this field in
order to update our knowledge of the sector and to provide a solid basis
for increased Bank lending for agriculture. The mission has been in close
contact with the Planning Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and
with the Agency for International Development (AID) which are jointly undertaking
a study to analyze development alternatives for the sector. The full report
of the Bank'mission is expected in August.
20.        The Atlantico project fits well into the overall policy objectives
of the Colombian Government and the lending strategy of the Bank. It is also
in harmony with the policy of the Colombian Government to finish those irriga-
tion and land reclamation projects that have already been started before
beginning any new ones of major scale. This will enable full benefits to
be gained from the infrastructure investments that have already been made,
and will allow them to become fully productive at an early date.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.        The proposed project would be the second stage of the First
Atlantico Project presently being financed by a Bank loan signed in 1967
(Loan 502-CO).  This stage was prepared by INCORA with the assistance of
a consulting firm,'TAHAL (Israel). Two distinct and separate types of
agricultural development were contemplated in the First Atlantico Project.
One concerned development of 3,900 hectares for irrigated farming; the
other aimed at improving 6,000 hectares for dry farming by providing drainage
and protection from floods. Implementation of the irrigation phase is behind
schedule by about two years, mainly because the specific lands to be provided
with irrigation had to be redefined; technical difficulties were encountered
in construction of the irrigation and drainage pumping plants,. The total
area to be irrigated has been reduced to 3,000 hectares. Work on protection
of the dry farm area was delayed pending the completion of plans for the
proposed Second Atlantico Development Project. Construction of these works



-7-
commenced in September 1971 and should be completed late in 1972.
Additional flood protection and drainage works required in this area
would be constructed under the Second Atlantico Project.
22.       Although effective flood control is not yet fully available,
progress has been made in the dry farming component of the First
Atlantico Project. About 3,000 hectares are now under production, of
which over 80 percent is double cropped. Soybeans, peanuts and tomatoes
are now being grown in addition to the traditional crops of sorghum,
sesame and cotton. In 1971 about Col$16 million worth of cash crops
were marketed through the project's cooperative, as compared to only
Col$3 million four years ago. As of May 31, 1972, US$4.1 million, or
46 percent, of Loan 502-CO had been disbursed.
23.       The proposed Second Atlantico Project was appraised in
October 1970, and negotiations were substantially completed in April 1971.
The head of the Colombian delegation was Dr. Antonio Barberena, at that
time General Manager of INCORA. However, a considerable delay in
government approval of the loan documents--pending a review of the project
by the Government within priorities among ongoing irrigation and settlement
projects--made it necessary for a Bank mission to update the appraisal in
the field in February 1972.
24.       The purpose of the Second Atlantico Development Project is
to supplement the flood protection and drainage works being constructed
for further development of the 6,000 ha of the dry farming area being
improved in the First Atlantico Project. In addition, the new project
would extend the area being improved by 11,000 ha, thus bringing to
17,000 ha the total dry farming area under the combined first and
second stages of,the Atlantic project.
25.       The principal components of the proposed project are: (a) construc-
tion of a drainage system; (b) construction of about 77 km of secondary and
tertiary roads;. (c) land preparation; (d) construction of storage depots;
(e) enlargement of operating headquarters; (f) acquisition by INCORA of
about 17,000 ha and distribution of about 14,400 ha of this land to about
1,800 small farmers. In addition, the project would provide for the
importation of equipment, the extension of TAHAL's contract for consulting
services, training of INCORA's staff, evaluation of irrigation trials on the
pilot farm, and the development of dairy farms through long-term credits.
26.       A loan summary sheet is attached as Annex III to this report
and an appraisal report (PA-84b) is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors.
27.       Project execution should start by the end of 1972 and be completed
by mid-1977. The proposed project would be carried out by Instituto Colombiano de
la Reforma Agraria (INCORA), the government agency with primary responsibility
for the implementation of the agrarian reform. Since its creation in 1961,



INCORA's total expenditure has amounted to the equivalent oTf US$300 million,
of which about 35 percent has constituted investment in physical infra-
structure, and a further 25 percent has been devoted to providing credit
to beneficiaries under the agrarian reform program.
28.       INCORA has received substantial external financial assistance.
In addition to the US$9 million loan for the First Atlantico Project, the
Bank has made a loan of US$17 million for agricultural credit (Loan 624-co)
and a US$8.1 million loan for the Caqueta Colonization project (Loan 739-CO).
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has lent a total of US$20.5 million
for irrigation projects, and AID has lent US$18 million for INCORA's super-
vised credit programs, apart from the counterpart funds from AID program
and agricultural sector loans allocated for INCORA investment activities
in amounts averaging US$13 million p.a. equivalent over the past six years.
29.       INCORA already owns approximately 5,600 ha of the Atlantico
project area and would obtain about 11,000 hectares from private landowners
by either private sale or expropriation with compensation in accordance
with the Agrarian Reform Law. The suitable acquired lands would be sub-
divided into lots of at least 8 ha and distributed to small farmers or
farm workers from the surrounding areas. (Private landowners are legally
entitled to retain a portion of their holdings, up to a maximwn of 100 ha.
Those who retain land would have to follow the cropping patte-rns prescribed
by INCORA for the project.)
30.       Two crops a year would be grown on about 12,400 ha with planting
adjusted to take advantage of the two rainy periods. Spring crops would
include sorghum, maize, and soybeans; the main fall crops would- be sesame,
soybeans,. cotton,, maize and tomatoes. As the project develops, other crops
and fruits and vegetables could eventually substitute for the above-mentioned
crops, if market prospects permit.   The remaining 4,600 ha would be developed
for dairy farming.  The foregoing figures include an estimated 2,500 hectares
of privately-held farms that would also benefit from the project.
31.       Supporting agricultural services, including technical assistance,
would be provided to project farmers through several government agencies
under INCORA supervision and coordination. The following agencies will be
involved in this task: ICA (Colombian Agriculture and Livestock Institute);
SENA (National Training Service); CECORA (Central Cooperative for Agrarian
Reform); CAC (Caribbean Agriculture and Livestock Cooperative); and IDEMA
(Agricultural Marketing Institute). Also, the services of the consultant
firm, mentioned in paragraph 25 above, would be employed during the implemen-
tation of the project.
32.        The total cost of, the proposed project, not including interest
during construction, is estimated at US$9.7 million. Local costs are
estimated at about US$6.3 million and foreign costs at US$3.4 million.



-9-
The US$5 million Bank loan would finance the estimated foreign costs,
about US$0.7 million of local costs and US$0.9 million for interest on
the loan during construction. The balance of the local costs, equivalent
to US$5.6 million, would be provided by the Government from its own
resources.
33.        The proposed amount of local cost financing is fully justified
since Colombia has a well-conceived development program, but, in spite of
its efforts to mobilize domestic resources for its support, still requires
external assistance in excess of the foreign exchange component of develop-
ment projects suitable for external lending.
34.        The proposed loan would help finance the cost of civil works,
imported equipment (vehicles, farm machinery, and operation and maintenance
equipment), consulting services, and training of INCORA personnel. Inter-
national campetitive bidding procedures would be followed in letting
contracts for civil works and for equipment purchases. All civil works
contracts, however, are expected to go to Colombian firms as an adequate
number of qualified local contractors is available and the contracts cannot
be combined into packages large enough to be attractive to foreign firms.
Because of the type of equipment involved, it is expected that virtually
all equipment contracts would be awarded to foreign firms, even though at
the request of the Government, local manufacturers would participate in the
international competitive bidding under a 15 percent margin of preference.
To the extent that any equipment contracts are won by Colombian manufacturers,
the ex-factory cost of the equipment, net of local taxes, would be eligible
for Bank financing.
J
35.        The estimated settlement cost per farm for the Second Atlantico
Development Project would be about the equivalent of US$).,300. These
figures compare with the estimated costs of US$12,000 equivalent per family
on irrigated land under the first stage project financed through Loan 502-CO.
36.        Farmers participating in the project would pay at least operating
and maintenance costs. They should also be able to make a significant contribution
toward the recovery of investment, the latter contribution to be determined
by a recently completed INCORA study of farmers' repayment capacity. The
8-ha size unit should enable each farmer's family to have a minimum annual net
income of Col$20,000, or about the equivalent of US$900.
37.        Bank Loan funds would be passed on by the Government to INCORA
on the same terms as the Bank Loan, i.e., for a term of 25 years with a six-
year grace period at 7-1/4 percent interest. The Government would assume the
exchange risk. Within INCORA, the project would be administered under the
general supervision of its headquarters in Bogota. Day-to-day project activi-
ties would be handled by INCORA's field headquarters in the project area under
the direction of a project manager, and the project office would be expanded
to meet the needs of the project.



- 10 -
38.        The output of the project area will be marketed with the assistance
of 3 institutions: CECORA, CAC, and IDEKA. Sorghum and maize will be
sold to manufacturers of feed concentrates such as Purina, while sesame,
cottonseed, soybean, and about half of the peanuts would be purchased by
oil processors in the coastal cities. The other half of the peanut crop
is expected to meet confectionary standards for export to Europe. Cotton
would be marketed through IDEMA, while tomatoes of canning quality would
be absorbed by the California Cannery in Barranquilla and Truco Cannery
in Cali. The fresh vegetable market in the coastal cities would also take
a sizeable portion of the crop. Milk would go mainly to Barranquilla through
CAC.
39.        The principal benefits to be derived from the project by the
Colombian economy would be in the form of: (a) increased production of crops
and milk; and (b) increased employment and income in the Department of
Atlantico. The net incremental value of production from the project would
be about US$2.5 million annually. About 1,800 farm families would benefit
directly from the program; another 650 heads of families would find permanent
employment as farm laborers. Also a great number of families would benefit
from the increase in employment opportunities through the induced impact of
the project on services and industry in the project area and in the coastal
cities.
4o.        The average life of project facilities has been estimated to be
40 years. The project is estimated to yield an economic rate of return of
about 23 percent. If project costs were to increase by 20 percent the rate
of return would decline to about 19 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Colombia, the draft Project Administration agreement between the Republic
of Colombia and INCORA, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
EKecutive Directors separately.
42.        The Project Administration Agreement covers, inter alia, the
provision of funds to INCORA, including proceeds of the proposed loan.
The draft Agreements contain covenants normally included in agreements
for land reclamation projects. Attention is drawn to the following pro-
visions:
(i) Section 3.02(f) of the Loan Agreement provides that the
Borrower shall cause INCORA to consult with the Bank before
making any appointment to the position of Project Manager.
(ii) Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement provides that the Borrower
shall cause INCORA to make suitable provision, acceptable to
the Bank, for the recovery of all operating and maintenance
costs of the project and as much as practicable of investment
costs of the project taking into account the need to ensure that
the farmers will have the necessary incentive to maximize production.



(iii)  Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement provides that the Borrower
shall take all necessary action, including the provision of
adequate funds, to insure that INCORA provides or arranges to
meet the seasonal credit requirements of project farmers and
the long-term credit requirements of dairy farmers for the
establishment of their farms.
(iv)  Section 8.01 of the Loan Agreement establishes as a condition
to effectiveness of the Loan Agreement the execution and
delivery of the Project Administration Agreement.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
There are now 24 effective loans under disbursement and these are
proceeding without significant delays in disbursements except for the
following:
US$39 million (Electric Power) loan of February, 1964 (Ln. 369)
In September 1967, the Executive Directors approved amendments
to the Loan Agreement to permit the financing of additional
generating units out of project savings. Subsequent delays in
the delivery of equipment made necessary a postponement of the
Closing Date to October 31, 1972, and it is expected that the
loan will be fully disbursed by that date.
US$9 million (Irrigation) loan of June, 1967 (Ln. 502)
This project has suffered from unexpected difficultiss in selecting
suitable irrigable soils. Construction is now two years behind
schedule and disbursements will probably not be completed before
the end of 1973.
US$18 million (Electric Power) loan of December, 1968 (Ln. 575)
In June 1971, the Executive Directors approved a change in the
project description for this loan for a power interconnection
project to allow the use of savings for the construction of an
additional transmission line (R 71-130).  The original project
has been completed and disbursements for the project addition are
proceeding at the forecast rate.
US$17 million (Agricultural Credit) loan of June, 1969 (Ln. 624)
This loan finances a 4-year supervised credit program of INCORA
to improve productivity on about 2,500 medium-size irrigated
and rainfed farms. The project has been affected by many problems,
one of which is that INCCRA now prefers to concentrate its
resources on fanmers who have already benefitted from the agrarian
refomi program4 thus excluding arsas presently undergoing such
programs. As only US$2.2 million of the US$17 million loan has
been disbursed through April 30, 1972, the Government is in the
process of preparing proposala for restructuring the project.
US$18.3 million (Livestock Development) loan of December, 1969 (Ln. 651)
This loan has been affected by policy and administrative problems,
among which are the unsatisfactory investment climate arising
from the lack of clarity in application of the Agrarian Reform
Law, and the failure on the part of the Government to provide
sufficient short-term financing for working capital and purchase
of feeder steers. The latter problem has left some participating
ranchers unable to service debts and has contributed to the



ANNEX I
Page L
slowdown  in the demand for Bank funds.  The Government feels that
proposed amendments to the Agrarian Reform Law, which have passed
the Senate and are awaiting House concurrence, should go a long
way toward resolving investment uncertainties in the agricultural
sector. The Government also has recently increased substantially
the availability of short-term funds for the Bank-financed project.
The loan is being. kept under close review, however, so that an
appropriate course can be embarked on if the rate of progress does
not improve substantially in the next few months.
US$18.5 million (Cali Water Supply and Sewerage) loan of June, 1970
(Ln.682)
Of this loan for a water supply and sewerage project in Cali,
US$1.7 million was disbursed as of April 30, 1972. The project
lost about one year=-due to a change in the Cali Municipal Govern-
ment that occurred after the loan was signed. It has since
progressed slowly mainly because of administrative difficulties
arising from the change in the Cali Municipal Government, which
resulted in a reduction in the borrower's independence, the
resignation of qualified staff and a reluctance on the pait of
the Government to provide counterpart contributions. As a result
of a further change in the Municipal Government after recent
elections, a new management will be installed this autumn which
it is hoped will improve the borrower's administration, and the
Bank is discussing with the Government a schedule for    payment
of its counterpart contributions. The project is being kept
under close supervision with a view to determining appropriate
Bank action if improvements fail to materialize during the course
of this year.,
US$6.5 million (Education) loan of June, 1970 (Ln. 679)
Disbursements under this loan (June 1970, US$6.5 million) for
an education project started slowly because of a change in
the administration of the executing agency that occurred after
the loan was-signed. Recent progress has been satisfactory;
construction has started on eight of nine schools included in
the project, and disbursements are expected to be completed
by the present Closing Date.

EXTRACT FROM THE PRESIDENTtS REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS
ON A PROPOSED LQAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA FOR A
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND EXPORT EXPANSION PROJECT
"8.       When the present Government took office in August 1970, Colombia's
economy was in a period of steadily accelerating growth. Coffee prices, while
declining from late 1969 and early 1970 highs, were still well above the prices
prevailing throughout the previous decade. The rate of increase of gross
domestic product and both public and private investment had been rising
strongly since 1967. Industrial growth was moving ahead of historical averages,
agriculture was keeping ahead of population growth, the rise in prices was be-
ing held down to a manageable 7 percent annual rate, and Government planners
were predicting a 7 percent real GDP growth in 1970 (actual growth was 6.7
percent, the third highest since 1950).
"9.       Although encouraged by these improvements in the overall economic
situation, Government planners were convinced that the existence of deep-
seated rural poverty and a high rate of urban unemployment made it necessary
to accelerate development. Depressed rural incomes reflecting low producti-
vity and the extremely small size of the vast majority of fams, coupled with
inadequate water supply, health care, education and the generally inferior
public services compared to urban areas, had led to a massive migration into
the cities and towns thus increasing urban unemployment. Between the early
1950's and mid-1960's, the largest cities grew at 7 percent a year, more than
double the rate of natural increase. The rate at which Colombia's labor
force was growing made the employment problem especially difficult. A 1970
ILO report estimated that for the next 10 to 15 years the labor force would
grow at 3.5 percent per year, one of the highest rates in the world. The
report estimated that open unemployment had reached as much as 10 percent in
Bogota and somewhat higher in the cities outside the capital, and that dis-
guised unemployment and underemployed amounted to another 15 percent of the
urban work force. More recent estimates indicate that open unemployment in
Bogota had declined slightly to about 9.8 percent in 1969 and 8.2 percent
in 1970, and it is likely that unemployment in other urban centers also de-
clined. (A noteworthy feature of these more recent developments is that
1969 and 1970 were years of accelerating output growth and rising invest-
ment.) During the last two decades employment rose by 2.2 percent per
year. This was associated with an output growth rate which averaged about
5 percent per year. At an average productivity growth rate of 3.2 percent per
year (ILO estimate), output would have to increase by 6.7 percent per annum
to absorb new entrants into the labor force, and at an even higher rate if
unemployment were to be reduced.
"10.      The new Government, therefore, drew up a development plan designed
to achieve or surpass 7 percent GDP growth in 1970-73. The plan stressed
particularly the need to associate higher growth rates with the creation of
increased employment opportunities. It called for a continuation of the
Agrarian Reform Program and an increased effort to provide agrarian reform
beneficiaries with supporting services. One aspect of the latter effort was
the initiation during 1971 of a program to increase the number of extension

offices of the Colombian agricultural research and extension agency from
the present 59 to 450 by 1975, a goal which is ambitious, but if achieved
would enable the agency to reach 900,000 farm families, or 70 percent of the
total of about 1.3 million families. Addressing itself to disparitiea be-
tween urban and rural development, the Government also embarked in 1971 upon
a plan which gave priority to adding classrooms to incomplete rural schools
and the development of rural "concentrations" (designed to provide educa-
tional, health, social and agricultural services in rural country towns and
villages). Reflecting the directions indicated in the plan, the investment
program gave increased emphasis to industry, education, housing and agricul-
ture and relatively less emphasis to investments in power and transport.
"11.      The prospects for carrying out the development proposed in the
new plan appeared favorable. A major reason for this was the apparent
lessening of the foreign exchange constraint. This was derived from two
sources. First, the continuing deficit of world coffee production relative
to consumption, reflected in the dramatic reduction of stocks in the hands
of producers, led to the expectation that the price of coffee, which still
represented almost two-thirds of merchandise exports, would decline only
gradually over a period of several years from the 58 cents average price for
the first half of 1970. Second non-traditional exports (i.e., exports
other than coffee and petroleum5, fueled by the Government's flexible ex-
change rate policy and the minor export subsidy,l/ doubled between 1966
and 1970 and Government planners were predicting a continued strong growth
of these exports, although at a somewhat slower rate. A further reason for
optimism was the demonstrated increase in the capacity to undertake develop-
ment projects. This was reflected in an increase in aggregate investment,
in particular a sharp rise in public investment, and in a substantial increase
in the flow of projects submitted for financing to international lending
agencies. The proportion of fixed capital investment to GDP in 1967-69 was
around 19 percent which is higher than the historical average, and the rate
of project commitments from external lending agencies increased from an
average of US$115 million per year from 1961-67 to an average of US$232
million during 1968-70. The main constraint, as it appeared then, was the
availability of local finance for investment, particularly in the public
sector. From 1950-58 public savings averaged 4-5 percent of GDP. In
1969-70, they reached nearly 7 percent of GDP, as a result of a sharp increase
in public revenues (40 percent in real terms in 1966-69). Nevertheless,
with the expanaion in public investment, it was apparent that the need for
public savings would continue to expand; in particular the demand for local
savings to support foreign-financed projects was increasing rapidly.
"12.      The Colombian economic situation and the Government's develop-
ment policies and programs were analyzed in the Bank's comprehensive economic
report, Economic Growth of Colombia: Problems and Prospects (WH-200a,
November 1, 1970 -- hereinafter referred to as the 1970 Economic Report).
1/ Exporters are issued "Tax credit certificates" equal to 15 percent of
the FOB value of non-traditional exports, which can be redeemed at face
value for the payment of taxes after a specified holding period.



ANNEX II
Page 4
The Consultative Group for Colombia, 'at its meeting in February 1971, con-
sidered this report and concluded that the development program was feasible
and merited the' support of the Group, provided that economic performance
continued to improve in accordance with the Government's stated policies.
Subsequent to the meeting the Government took the principal actions con-
sidered necessary to support the development program. Sales taxes were raised
in April 1971, stamp taxes were increased on a long list of items and, in
June, the "petroleum dollar" exchange rate applicable to crude petroleum
transactions was raised from Col$9 to Col$20, eliminating a costly subsidy
paid to consumers of fuels by the Government. It resulted in a 45 percent
increase in the retail price of motor gasoline, and will produce substantial
new fuel tax proceeds.
"13.     Unfortunately, during 1971, there was a sharp,, unexpected drop in
coffee prices and unusually heavy and prolonged rainfall, which broke the
momentum of growth and disrupted development. GDP growth slackened to an
estimated 5.5 percent in 1971, while prices, spurred by reduced supplies of
foodstuffs, rose by 10-12 percent (see paragraphs 14 and 15 below). The
authorities cut the import budget, stepped up efforts to promote non-traditional
exports, and imposed strict monetary measures to dampen demand. At the same
time, however, the Government felt that extraordinary assistance was necessary,
and requested the Bank to coasider, as an extraordinary measure, a program
loan designed to restore the' development program to the levels approved by the
Consultative Group.
"l14.    The Government had prepared the quantitative targets for its
1970-73 development plan associated with GDP growth of 7 percent on the
assumption of an average New York coffee price of 56 cents per pound for
1971. The coffee price had reached 60 cents in 1969 and held firm for
several months in 1970, averaging just under 58 cents per pound during the
first semester. As indicated above, it was projected that prices would
gradually weaken beginning in 1971 and reach a level of about 50 cents after
several years. Nevertheless, and for reasons outside the control of the
Colombians, prices dropped sharply from 57 cents per pound in June 1970 to
less than 52 cents in December. Shipments from Colombia also fell off rapid-
ly    through the end of 1970. In 1971, the coffee price unexpectedly con-
tinued to fall, reached a low point of 48 cents, and averaged 49 cents per
pound for the year. Thus, Colombia was faced with the situation in which
coffee prices declined in one year to the level that had been expected only
after at least three or four years. The extent of the problem is emphasized
by the fact that for each one cent per pound drop in the average coffee price.
Colombia's foreign exchange receipts decline by US$8.4 million. In recent
months the New York coffee prices have recovered to 52-53 cents, but the
dollar cost of Colombia's imports has also risen and the foreign exchange
constraint has continued.
"15.     The coffee problem was compounded by the heavy rains which fell
almost continuously from late 1970 until mid-1971. In the Cauca Valley,
for example, which is probably the most important agricultural area of the
country, the Cauca River established a new monthly flow record in November
1970 and reached average flow levels during January - April 1971 which were



ANNEX II
Page 5
the highest since 1950.   The unusually severe weather flooded large areas,
interrupted transportation and communications, delayed farm planting and
exerted strong upward pressure on domestic food prices. The Colombian
Government was required to make unexpected public expenditures for road and
bridge repair, emergency medical and food assistance, and relief. No pre-
cise data are yet available on the effects of flood and rain damage on agri-
cultural production in 1971, but current estimates are that there was little
or no real growth in agricultural production in that year and that weather
damage was one of the principal causes.
"16.      Another disappointment in late 1970 and the first half of 1971
was the slowdown in the growth of non-traditional exports, i.e., everything
other than coffee and crude petroleum. These exports rose little if at all
during 1970. During the first semester of 1971 export registrations rose
7 percent above the comparable period in 1970. The unexpectedly poor per-
formance may be attributed to two factors. First, an increase in domestic
demand associated with a high rate of economic growth diverted production
from the export market to the domestic market. Secondly, after three con-
secutive years of rapidly expanding exports, there remained considerably
less excess capacity in the industries concerned than before. There is
evidence that these problems had had their maximum effect on minor export
growth by mid-1971. Non-traditional exports picked up significantly during
the latter half of 1971 and, for the year as a whole, they increased by 15
percent over the level achieved in 1970.
"20.      The effects of the changed circumstances of 1971 were analyzed
in the 1972 economic report (Economic Position and Prospects of Colombia,
WH-211a, January 14, 1972) which concluded that balance of payments and fis-
cal constraints had again become the main obstacles to the maintenance of
a high level of growth in output and employment. The report concluded, how-
ever, that Colombia should be able gradually to reach and sustain a 7 percent
growth rate by the mid-1970's if (a) non-traditional exports grew at a rate
of 15 percent per annum (b) adequate new tax measures were adopted to yield
Col$1,000 million per annum, beginning in 1973, in order to ensure a satis-
factory rate of growth in public investment and (c) Colombia continued to
borrow sufficient amounts externally on favorable terms.
"21.      Since the end of 1971, there has been considerable progress in these
areas. With respect to non-traditional exports, it appears that export re-
gistrations during the first three months of 1972 grew by at least 15 per-
cent over the comparable period in 1971, and the Govenment in late 1971 and
early 1972 adopted a number of measures, in addition to continuing its flex-
ible exchange rate policy,!/ which should give further inpetus to minor ex-
port growth: the required holding period for tax credit certificates was
reduced from 9 months to 6 months for some exports and 3 months for others.
1/ The exchange rate with respect to the US dollar has been depreciating
pari passu with domestic price increases, thus assuring an effective
devaluation vis-a-vis the world's major currencies.

The National Monetary Board issued a resolution authorizing the export pro-
motion agency (PROEXPO) to borrow up to US$30 million equivalent from the
Banco de la Republica for the financing of private sector exports and for
financing imports required by export enterprises. The main purpose of this
new measure is to provide a substitute for foreign sources of export financ-
ing, but it should also provide a twofold stimulus to exports. First, many
firms with established lines of external credit will probably choose to
maintain their traditional financial arrangements, and to this extent the new
measure would increase the total resources available for export financing.
Secondly, as exporting firms will no longer be obliged to seek financing from
foreign financial intermediaries, the new measure should help increase the
export potential of newer and smaller firms who do not have access to exter-
nal sources of finance. The same Monetary Board resolution increased by
approximately US$7 million equivalent the local currency funds available to
PROEXPO for. financing trade fairs, export publicity and certain other in-
vestments of exporting firms.
"22.      The investment climate in Colombia is currently favorable, as evi-
denced in part by the rapidity with which industrial investors have taken
up sub-loans under the most recent Bank loan (742-CO) to the privately-owned
development finance companies (see paragraph 37 below). It is likely that
recent political developments will continue to be favorable to investment.
As for the agriculture, there have been widespread reports during the past
year that the lack of clarity in application of the Agrarian Reform Law has
caused investment uncertainty. However, proposed amendments to the Agrarian
Reform Law which have passed the Senate and are awaiting concurrence of the
Chamber of Deputies should help improve the investment climate in agriculture.
"23.      In the fiscal area, the Colombia Government has already reformed
the customs tariff and additional revenue measures are expected to yield
about Col$ 700 million beginning in 1973, and several other measures, designed
to yield at least an additional Col$ 300 million, are at various stages of
processing. The Consultative Group, in its February 1972 meeting gave its
support to US$350 million in new external commitments for projects in Colombia
for 1972, agreed that it was essential for the preservation of Colombia's
creditworthiness to receive external financing on terms which would avoid
deterioration of its debt structure, and agreed further that substantial non-
project assistance was necessary to enable the Government to achieve its
growth and investment objectives.
Creditworthiness Prospects
"7.       If the Colombian Government is to meet its growth and employment
objectives, the net transfer of external financial resources flowing from
the Consultative Group will have to continue at high levels during the next
five years. Bank disbursements expressed as a percentage of total public
disbursements to Colombia should peak at 40 percent in 1973-7L and then

decline. The Bank's share of total debt service is also projected to peak
at about 40 percent in 1974-75 before turning down, and the Bank group share
of total debt disbursed and outstanding should stay at about 33 percent dur-
ing the next several years, assuming that Bank lending over the next few years
averages about US$120 million per annum. Thanks to the relatively large
supply of assistance from development agencies, and careful borrowing policy,
Colombia's debt structure is favorable; suppliers' and financial credits
account for only one-tenth of the total medium and long-term debt. This has
been an important factor in holding down the debt servicing burden despite
the large capital inflow. Colombia is one of the countries whose debt ser-
vice ratio has fallen in recent years. The ratio was 15 percent in 1965-66
and 13 percent in 1971. Under the impact of projected growth in gross bor-
rowing, the ratio would be back to 15 percent by 1975. The debt servicing
burden in the more distant future will be influenced by the terms of borrow-
ing: a decline in assistance by AID and other bilateral long-term develop-
ment agencies would result in a peak debt service ratio of 25 percent in 1982.
If commitments from bilateral development lenders increase gari passu with
total capital requirements, the need for private credits would be reduced
and the debt service ratio would stabilize at 21 percent in 1982. These pro-
jections assume a relatively low price of coffee. Should export earnings
from coffee improve notably, external borrowing requirements would be reduced
and debt service would accordingly be lower. It is nevertheless likely that
the burden will increase from the present level, but this should be manage-
able as long as domestic savings and non-traditional exports (discussed in
Part II and III below) continue to rise at a satisfactory rate, and terms of
borrowing do not deteriorate seriously. In the light of past perfonmance
and present prospects, therefore, I believe that Colombia is creditworthy
for the borrowing presently contemplated."
