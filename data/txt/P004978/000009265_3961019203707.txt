SOCIAL SAFETY NET SUPPORT PROJECT
Loan and Project Sunnnary
Borrower:                   Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria
Executing Agencies:         Ministry of Labor, Social Protection, and Vocational Training
Ministry of Agriculture
Ministry of Public Works
Ministry of the Interior
Beneficiaries:              Not applicable
Project Objectives:         The project seeks to create temporary jobs for the unemployed, to
improve the social safety net system in Algeria, and to pilot social
development programs based on increased community participation.
Project Description:        A labor-intensive public works scheme, located in disadvantaged areas
and executed mainly by small private enterprises, would provide about
20,000 person-years of temporary employment in road, agriculture, and
water and sewerage maintenance.  The Government's current social
safety net programs would be strengthened through studies, equipment
provision, and training. A pilot program to improve social infrastructure
would be established and feasibility work undertaken to develop a Social
Fund.
Poverty Category:           Program of targeted interventions. Public works programs are designed
to more effectively target the unemployed and poor with temporary job
creation. The reforms of the existing social safety net aim to improve
targeting of activities directed towards the poor and to enhance service
quality. Reforms in eligibility criteria for some social programs will
target poor female heads of household.
Amount:                     US$50.0 million
Terms:                      Repayable in 17 years including a five-year grace period, at the Bank
standard variable interest rate.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND
POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A
SOCIAL SAFETY NET SUPPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for US$50 millon equivalent to help finance a social
safety net support project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 17 years, including five years of grace.
2.    Country and Sector Background. Algeria is embarking on a deep economic transition from
a state-controlled, oil-dependent economy to a private- sector-led one; on a fundamental change in social
values; and on a political transition from a centralized structure to a democratic, decentralized system.
3.    These transitions are taking place under very difficult circumstances. Since 1986 there has been
a cumulative decline in per capita consumption of 28% and of household disposable income of 31 %. The
economic decline has led to soaring unemployment, an estimated 25% in 1994 and 65% among the
young. Compounded by rapid population growth, there is a growing housing crisis, with an average
occupancy rate of 8 persons per unit, the highest in North Africa. These economic and social pressures
have been reflected in increased political turmoil and unrest, especially over the last four years.
4.    There is now cause for cautious optimism. Aware that there can be no return to the past, over
the last two years the Government has launched a far-reaching stabilization and adjustment program with
the assistance of the Bank and the IMF. Macro-economic management has improved dramatically, trade
has been liberalized, prices freed, and general subsidies virtually eliminated. Many legislative and
regulatory measures are now in place to stimulate private sector growth. The programs are starting to
show results. GDP growth, led by the private sector, was estimated at 3.5 % in 1995, the first per capita
growth in a decade. Finally, the November 1995 elections took place in a calm environment and the
current president was elected with 61 % of the vote.
5.    Nonetheless, Algeria remains a high risk country, both politically and economically. A sustained
supply response will require acceleration of the reform agenda. The authorities will need to be firmly
committed to broad-based political and social dialogue. More efficient safety net and employment
programs will be required to demonstrate the authorities' commitment to broad-based development in a
new economic context.
6.    At this time the Government appears committed to intensify the transformation of the economy
from one which is centrally planned and public-sector dominated to one where the private sector is the
engine of growth and where decision-making is decentralized.  To reduce unemployment the
Government's highest priority is the promotion of broad-based sustainable economic growth. At the same
time the Government is promoting a variety of labor-intensive programs designed to provide temporary
employment during the transition.



- 2 -
7.     While there are no official estimates of poverty in Algeria, in recent years poverty has most
probably increased, reflecting the decline in per capita consumption. An ongoing Living Standards
Measurement Survey (LSMS) will provide valuable information on the nature and extent of poverty.
Through the 1970s and early 1980s. the social safety net system was fairly successful at alleviating
poverty, in great part because, through1 oil rents, fiscal costs were not a major constraint. The main
challenge to the system IIow is to protect the vulnerable during the transition period under a constrained
budget.
8.     The Government has gradually moved from  a broadly based program of cash transfers to one
which is better targeted to vulnerable populations. Along with other programs, in 1994 the Government
introduced a cash transfer system (AFS) directed to poor heads of households who were unable to work.
A second transfer scheme (PAIG) was established for the able-bodied unemployed who undertook tasks
developed by municipalities at an amount equivalent to half the minimum wage. The Government defines
these tasks not as work but as acts of "social solidarity". Both programs are a significant improvement
over past ones and are more affordable, but they require further improved management and targeting.
9.     Project Objectives. In support of the Government's social sector strategy, the project seeks to:
(a) create employment and improve infrastructure and services in disadvantaged areas of the country; (b)
enhance the effectiveness of Algeria's social safety net system; and (c) prepare, on a pilot basis, social
development program aimed at developing infrastructure and alleviating poverty. Most of these programs
are new and innovative. If successful, and if the political/economic situation stabilizes, then Algeria
could seek a broader program mobilizing major financial resources from multilateral and bilateral donors.
10.    Project Description. The three main project components are described below.
11.    Public Works (88 % of base costs). The project will support a pilot labor-intensive public works
program (travaux d'utilite publique or TUP) in local and district road maintenance, agriculture, water
supply and sewerage, to be undertaken in under-served urban and rural areas. These programs differ
significantly from the PAIG in that they have increased emphasis on social and economic value added,
with closer supervision of works, and greater private sector participation. They will provide short-term
employment, encourage growth of small enterprises, maintain basic infrastructure and services, and
improve the environment in selected poor communities.
12.    Specifically, about 13,000 km of roadside maintenance will be carried out. This would include
6,700 km of wilaya roads in 15 wilayas, and 4,500 km of communal roads in 14 other wilayas, and up
to 2,000 km of roads to be selected in the near future. Locations were selected on the basis of high
unemployment, little or no budget for maintenance, and adequate security. Small private task teams,
under contract, will undertake simple labor-intensive works in roadside maintenance. The road
maintenance component will help develop the small-scale private sector, particularly those using labor-
intensive methods, rather than relying on work done by Government force account as has been the case
in the past.
13.   In agriculture, five sub-programs will focus on maintenance and environmental improvement.
These include elimination of caterpillar infestations in 50,000 ha. of pine forests; reduction of
desertification in vulnerable areas in 53,000 ha. in two provinces through regeneration and rejuvenation
of the alfa plant; maintenance of watershed and irrigation infrastructures in one wilaya; flood control
through afforestation and fruit tree planting, in one wilaya; and cleaning and maintenance of irrigation
drains in one wilaya.



14.   In water and sewerage the project will assist the utilities in improving and rehabilitating their
water supply and sewerage assets, through labor-intensive maintenance activities, including: detection
and repair of leaks from water supply pipelines installed in the 17 wilayas; cleaning and repair of sewers
in 15 wilayas; and provision of public utilities, essentially water supply and sewerage, in two wilayas.
15.    Overall, the roadside maintenance component will provide about 5,500 person-years of
employment, the agriculture component about 10,000 person-years and the water supply component about
4,600 person-years, for a total of 20,100 person-years. The labor portion of all these activities will range
between 50 and 75% of total cost. All activities have been designed to require the minimum of
specialized training as well as labor-intensive techniques.
16.    Strengthening the Social Safety Net (5%  of base costs). Two sub-components will help to
strengther. the Government's social safety net. The first program will focus on improving management,
targeting and monitoring of the Government's social assistance programs through (a) setting up a
management information system (MIS), with related hardware, software, and specialized training
programs; (b) implementing a large-scale training program reaching 2,000 civil servants responsible for
oversight of social safety net programs; and (c) undertaking a field survey to determiiie the characteristics
of AFS/PAIG recipients.
17.    The second sub-component will support a pilot program in which community social service units
(cellules de proximite), consisting of health, education, and social services and sports and culture
professionals, have been established within slums. These units identify problems, provide services, and
link slum dwellers with service agencies. The existing 20 units and regional and central offices will be
provided with equipment, vehicles, computers and software. In addition the project will support a
national training program, a national seminar, and a follow-up evaluation to determine under what
conditions the program should be expanded.
18.    Social Development Programs (6% of base costs). The project will support small-scale testing
as well as preparation activities for a larger-scale social fund. The future social fund would be managed
by an autonomous agency, with its own rules and regulations, and an independent board. Its activities
would be based on bottom-up identification of local community needs, its focus would be on improving
local social and community infrastructure, and implementation would be undertaken by local
communities, the private sector, and NGOs.  The Government has indicated its commitment to
establishing and making operational such an agency with these goals.
19.    To help the start-up of a social fund, a pilot program will be undertaken in three sites. In these
three sites an evaluation will be undertaken of community needs and proposals made for interventions and
implementation modalities.  The interventions, which have not been pre-identified, could include
construction of community infrastructure, maintenance, and social services such as training and local
institutional development.



- 4 -
20.   In addition to the pilot program the project will undertake preparatory work to define the nature
and operations of the future Agency responsible for a Social Fund.' In particular, a study will identify,
on the basis of a national sample, community needs for social infrastructure, as well as the means for
undertaking a demand-based program of local infrastructure development. Study tours will be undertaken
to review experiences of Social Funds elsewhere in the world. Pre-engineering work will be undertaken
to prepare estimates of the unit costs for expected interventions.
21.    Project Implementation. For the TUP programs, the representative of the MTPS at the wilaya
level will be responsible for financial matters and the representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture and
Fisheries, Equipment and Land Use Planning, and Interior and Environment at the wilaya level will be
responsible for technical implementation. A draft Agreement between the MTPS and the above-
mentioned ministries for implementing the project at the wilaya level, including the flow of funds and
of decision-making, has been prepared.
22.    The Government has taken a number of further innovative steps to ensure rapid implementation
and disbursement. These include (a) establishing a Special Treasury Fund (STF), managed by MTPS,
bypassing normal budgeting procedures and permitting advance payments from three to six months for
all TUP activities; (b) simplified procurement procedures for small contracts; and (c) simplified internal
documentation procedures.
23.    A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been established within MTPS. The PCU will be
responsible for oversight and coordination of the TUP programs and for directly implementing the social
safety net and social fund components. For supervision and monitoring of TUP programs, the PCU will
be assisted by a private consulting firm, for which a short list has already been agreed.
24.    Project Sustainability. The eventual establishment of an autonomous agency responsible for the
social fund will ensure an adequate institutional structure for future public works programs. Incremental
recurrent costs under the project will be minimal, since no new permanent staff will be recruited.
Increased efficiency in managing the social safety net system may result in savings which could be
accrued to public works programs.
25.    Lessons from Previous Projects. The experience of the Bank in financing road programs has
been successful because of the strong institutional capacity of the Ministry of Equipment and Land Use
Planning. At the same time, all Bank-financed projects in Algeria have faced problems of slow
procurement and disbursement, and some projects, for example in health and agriculture, have been
closed because of a lack of Government commitment. The main lesson to be learned is that Government
must be fully committed to project goals, project design should be simple, and institutional and
procurement arrangements fully worked out in advance. In the case of the proposed project, the
Government is strongly committed to the project and has designed a system for rapid decision-making
and financing flows which would bypass most normal bureaucratic processes.
1/     Technical assistance to help prepare an implementation manual with guidelines for the selection, financing,
execution, supervision, monitoring/evaluation, and reporting/auditing of sub-projects, as well as defining the
environmental  criteria  for  sub-project  selection  is  being  provided  under  separate  financing.



- 5 -
26.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's CAS discussed by the Board February 27, 1996
focusses on (a) stimulating private-sector-led, employment-generating growth through deepening the
reform program, (b) protecting the poor during the transition through targeted operations, and (c)
enhancing the country's ability to mobilize external resources.
27.    To address social needs the Bank is undertaking both lending and non-lending activities.  The
SAL includes conditionality to support the rationalization of the overall social safety net and increase
targeting, management and coordination of programs. The Social Safety Net Support Project directly
supports CAS and SAL objectives through the establishment of a public works program and the
strengthening of the management and targeting of the social safety net. The Bank is discussing additional
labor-intensive projects in housing and in agriculture, designed to target the poor and increase
employment, in parallel with broader sector-wide adjustment programs. The Bank is also beginning
discussions on programs which would support the development of micro, small, and medium-size private
enterprises.
28.   As part of its commitment to Algerian social sector reform, the Bank will finance 80% of project
costs net of taxes or 71% of total project costs (including taxes). This level of financing is justified
because of Algeria's current exceedingly difficult political, economic and social situation and tight
budgetary constraints, and will enable the Algerian Government to indicate to its people its commitment
to improving the welfare of vulnerable populations during a period of structural adjustment.
29.    The Bank's medium-term analytical work focusses on undertaking poverty analysis, based on
Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS), the field work of which has recently been completed.
The poverty analysis is expected to help the Government of Algeria improve its poverty reduction strategy
and targeting capabilities. A labor market study is also planned for the near future.
30.   Agreed Actions. Before Board presentation, the Government established the Project Coordination
Unit and prepared a draft agreement among the participating ministries relating to project implementation.
A condition of loan effectiveness will be the signing of the above-mentioned agreement. The following
are conditions and assurances related to two components of the project: (a) for the pilot social fund, a
condition of disbursement will be an assessment of local needs, and formulation of an investment plan
and methods of implementation; (b) for the Social Safety Net component, a study to establish an MIS and
an investment program to computerize the management of AFS/PAIG, including a plan for acquisition
of equipment and training, will be completed by December 31, 1996. The first two contracts for the
roadside maintenance, agriculture, and water and sewerage component of the public works program will
be reviewed by the Bank, and the first two proposals for strengthening individual community social
service units will be reviewed by the Bank. The PCU will be maintained within MTPS with professional
staffing in adequate number, whose qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank. An autonomous
agency for social development (Social Fund) will be established and its internal rules of operations
defined by March 31, 1997. Arrangements acceptable to the Bank for assisting the PCU in project
supervision will be in place by September 30, 1996, and a mid-term review will be undertaken by
December 31, 1997.
31.   Program Objective Category. The project will support a program of targeted interventions
through reforms of the country's poverty reduction strategy. TUP programs are designed to target the
unemployed and poor with temporary job creation. The reforms of the existing social safety net
programs aim to improve targeting and enhance service quality. In addition the reforms to AFS eligibility
criteria would target poor female heads of household and the strengthening of the community social
service units would be of greatest benefit to women and children.

32.    Environmental Rating. The small-scale public works activities to be financed by the project will
have no significant negative environmental impact. The agricultural activities are designed to have a
positive environmental impact. Othier activities are environmiientallv neutral. The project raises no
international water rights issues nor does it involve the resettlement of local population. Activities to
prepare a future Social Fund will include the development of environmenital guidelinles and ch, cklists.
While the project is coded as "B, ' no study in advance of negotiations was required.
33.    Participatory Approach. An assessmenlt will be undertakeni to identify needs of vulnerable
populations, define programs and modalities of operation of the pilot and large-scale proposed Social
Fund. A survey will be undertaken to identify the impact on beneficiaries of the AFS/PAIG programs.
34.    Project Benefits. The expected project benefits include, for the PAIG, (a) productivity gains on
the labor employed through supervision to ensure workers actually work on the job, ensure compliance
with technical standards for the job. and enforce an 8-hour work day for one-hlalf the minimum wage
instead of the frequently observed 4-hour standard; (b) improved returns on resources invested through
training for project administrators in the selection of more economically valuable PAIG sub-project
activities; and (c) social welfare gains through better self-targeting of beneficiaries by enforcing the work
requirement. For the AFS, social welfare gains are expected through better targeting and service to AFS
beneficiaries through a revision of eligibility and payment practices.  Depending on the quality of
implementation, economic benefits may be very high. Even a very conservative estimate of a 5%
allocative effic.ency gain represents US$15.4 million per year. or 385% of (broadly defined) incremental
recurrenit costs of the component.
35.    The public works program (TUP) would provide 20,000 person-years of short term employment.
Activities undertaken under the TUP component of the proposed project would have two types of
economic benefits: first, the direct economic value of the sub-projects themselves; and second, the value
of the TUP as an alternative job creation program model, which may guide future reforms of the PAIG
and/or provide the basis for a future social fund. Additional benefits from the TUP include promoting
the development of small private enterprises, initiating a practice of decentralized, local-level participation
in both decision making and implementation (within both government and communities), and providing
economically and socially valuable services in under-served areas.
36.    Project Risks. In spite of modest objectives and strong Government commitment, project risks
are significant and should not be under-estimated. Any diminished ability of the Government to project
its authority at local levels will jeopardize implementation of the locally-based public works programs.
In the past, the Government has had difficulty in maintaining macro-economic reforms. Slowing down
of the reform effort could undermine the sustainability of social safety net recurrent finance commitments.
The multi-sectoral (and hence, multi-ministerial) nature of the project increases its complexity. However,
the inter-ministerial agreement and the use of simplified procurement, disbursement, and documentation
procedures should reduce complications to a minimum. The inability of Bank staff and most foreign
consultants to visit the country (beyond short highly controlled visits to Algiers) because of the security
situation means that we may be unaware of key elements or issues which could compromise effective
implementation. This problem will be partially overcome through the recruitment of Algerian and
regionally-based consultants for supervision. Coordination within the Bank will be equally important.
To that end, staff from the sectoral divisions have been closely involved in the technical discussions and
will be expected to supervise project components.
