1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.     Honduras has historically been one of the poorest countries in Latin America. At
time of appraisal, the country had a population of about 7 million people, and an annual
per capita income estimated at US$920; an estimated 63 percent of the population lived
below the poverty line, most of them in rural areas. The country’s record of poor
economic growth, recurrent macroeconomic imbalances, vulnerability to natural disasters,
and a decade-long legacy of periodic fiscal mismanagement were key factors contributing
to Honduras’ high poverty rate and weak social indicators. The country initiated a series
of ambitious economic and structural reform programs throughout the 1990s to stabilize
the economy, promote faster economic growth, and improve social conditions.

2.     In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch caused major damage, and defeated much of
the country’s development progress from the past decade. Following this natural disaster,
the Government presented the Plan for National Reconstruction and Transformation,
aimed at long-term sustainable poverty reduction and economic recovery. In this context,
the Government prepared a Poverty Reduction Strategy, also a requirement to qualify for
the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Relief Initiative (HIPC), and presented a
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) (Report No. 22661-HO), to the IMF’s and
World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in June and July 2001, respectively, and an
associated first Progress Report (Report No. 27648-HO) in February 2004.

3.      The main objective of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) was to reduce
poverty by 24 percent over the period 2001-15 by meeting the Millennium Development
Goals. The strategy was founded on six pillars: (i) accelerating equitable and sustainable
growth to levels consistent with income poverty reduction targets, (ii) reducing rural
poverty, (iii) reducing urban poverty, (iv) enhancing investment in human capital, (v)
strengthening social protection for vulnerable groups, and (vi) ensuring the strategy’s
sustainability through governance and institutional reforms and enhanced environmental
sustainability.

4.      Despite the presence of a coherent and focused strategy and Government
commitment to the reforms proposed in the PRSP, initial implementation made little
advancements. The two main challenges to assure effective implementation of the PRS
arose from shortcomings in the operationalization of the strategy and the public sector’s
weak institutional capacity to implement the necessary reforms.

5.      The Honduras Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2006 (Report No. 25873-HO),
was based on the objectives and priorities expressed in the PRSP. The Bank’s strategy
explicitly contemplated a technical assistance project to support PRS implementation,
acknowledging the shortcomings in PRS operationalization and weak institutional
capacity. These weaknesses were also identified in the 2004 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment – CFAA (Report No. 28418-HO) and the 2004 Country
Procurement Assessment Report - CPAR (Report No. 32791-HO). The Poverty Reduction
Support Technical Assistance Project (PRSTAC) (P083851, approved on July 24, 2004),

                                            1
evaluated in this ICR, followed the purpose to assist Honduras in moving forward with its
PRS by strengthening the public sector’s institutional capacity with the final goal to
alleviate poverty and meet the Millennium Development Goals. Giving support to a
number of promising reform initiatives initiated by the Maduro Administration, Bank
support was concentrated through a series of programmatic PRSCs, complemented by the
PRSTAC, which was specifically designed to implement the measures under the PRSCs
and with the final objective to meet the PRS targets. Although linking the project results
directly to the PRS posed many risks, the Bank took advantage of this window of
opportunity to support potentially far-reaching reforms. As support areas were expected
to change during the implementation of the PRSCs, the PRSTAC design consequently
reflected those expectations through a broad project development objective.

6.      Previous to the PRSTAC and the PRSCs, the World Bank had supported the
reform program through a series of Public Sector Modernization Projects, which aimed at
restoring fiscal sustainability and increasing private sector participation in the provision
of public goods. The PRSTAC followed and built on progress achieved under the
Economic and Financial Management Project (EFMTAC) (P060785), which was
approved on September 12, 2000 and closed on September 30, 2006.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.     The objective of PRSTAC as stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
was to assist the Government of Honduras in improving its institutional capacity in the
areas of planning, participatory monitoring, public expenditure management,
accountability, public administration, and public service delivery thereby facilitating
implementation of the PRS.

8.     The key outcome indicators of the PDO were aligned with the Government’s PRS
and described in detail in the Results Framework (Annex 3 of the PAD) as followed:

   (i)    Enhanced capacity to monitor and improve the Poverty Reduction Strategy in a
          participatory manner, in order to use it as an effective instrument to align public
          sector resources
   (ii)   Creation of a more qualified and streamlined public sector and administrative
          career path under implementation in the Central Government
   (iii) Competent fiscal and financial management institutions promoting efficient and
         transparent use of public resources with credible and independent accountability
         systems in place
   (iv) Timely and effective public services delivery in key sectors of the PRS




                                              2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.       The PDO and key indicators remained unchanged during the project. However,
during the mid-term review, the Government and the Bank agreed to the adaption of
activities under Component 2. As a consequence, one indicator under Component 2 was
not achievable, as it directly referred to the passing of the new Civil Service Law. The
change is a result of an agreement between the Bank and the Government to approve a
Regulatory Decree instead of passing a new law. In addition, due to the lack of fiscal
space, the Bank agreed in 2006 to drop the target for public expenditure allocated to
poverty reduction programs.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.    The PAD does not identify specific project beneficiaries. However, based on
characteristics of the project, the main direct beneficiaries are central government staff
and citizens. Hereby, citizens would benefit from (i) improved poverty reduction
programs, (ii) enhanced public service delivery, (iii) more transparency in the allocation
of public funds, and (iv) better investment climate. Government staff would benefit from
gaining additional skills through training, and improved working conditions.

1.5 Original Components

11.     The total amount of the project was US$12.85 million, which were financed by an
IDA credit (US$8 million), with co-financing from the Government of Sweden (US$3.8
million) through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA),
the Government of the United Kingdom (US$0.3 million) through the UK Department
for International Development (DFID), and a counterpart financing from the Government
of Honduras in the amount of US$0.8 million. The distribution of financing sources by
component is shown in the table below.

Project Component 1: Develop the Capacity to Manage, Monitor, Evaluate and
Improve PRS Implementation.

12.     The objective of this component was to strengthen the Government’s capacity to
monitor, evaluate, and open the process of consultation for the PRSP and subsequent
progress reports. The following sub-components were supported by this operation:
 Sub-Component 1.1: Develop UNAT’s Analytical Capacity. This sub-component
    was to strengthen UNAT’s (Unidad de Apoyo Técnico) capacity to analyze and
    disseminate the results of public programs associated with the Government’s poverty
    reduction strategy. Activities included: (i) the recruitment of specialized staff for
    UNAT; (ii) the carrying-out of impact analyses and assessments of PRS-related
    programs; and (iii) the dissemination of such studies.
   Sub-Component 1.2: Strengthen the Government’s Capacity to Coordinate Foreign
    Assistance. Government and stakeholders were committed to the creation and
    implementation of sector programs SWAps around PRS priorities. Activities
    included: (i) the design and implementation of SWAps in selected sectors; and (ii) the
    development and dissemination of adequate guidelines on SWAps.
   Sub-Component 1.3: Enhance the PRS Consultative Process. This sub-component
    systematized the PRSP participatory process through regular consultations with
    communities to identify priorities, complemented by stakeholder involvement in
    designing and implementing the Strategy’s programs. Activities under this sub-
    component were geared to strengthen work undertaken by the PRS Consultative
    Council (CCERP) in PSR monitoring and evaluation.

Project Component 2: Improve the Implementation of Public Sector Management.

13.     The objective of this component was to support the implementation of the new
Civil Service legislation, thereby ensuring a more equitable working environment with
better performance incentives and improved quality of civil servants. It also strengthened
the Government’s budgetary, financial, and fiduciary management to produce a more
accurate, timely, relevant, and transparent public sector. The following sub-components
were supported by this operation:

   Sub-Component 2.1: Implement the New Civil Service Law and Continue with
    Efforts to Reengineer the Public Sector. This sub-component would help the
    Government implement a new Civil Service Law being discussed. This legislation
    included renewed provisions for the establishment of transparent and less politically
    influenced procedures for hiring, evaluation, and dismissal of public servants.
    Activities under this sub-component included: (i) the expansion of the Human
    Resource Management System (SIARH) and its integration with SIAFI; (ii) the
    conceptualization of the structure and functions of the new Civil Service Regulatory
    Office and equipping the latter for its day-to-day operations; (iii) training of civil
    servants in topics related to HR management; (iv) carrying out of studies on the fiscal
    impact of the redefined wage policy and a strategy to ensure its fiscal sustainability;
    (v) support to Government efforts to reengineer the public administration in a number
    of additional public entities; and (vi) the contracting of a specialized firm to conduct

                                             4
    independent personnel evaluation activities in pilot agencies and to develop the
    capacity of those entities to apply the new HR policies regarding posts classifications,
    recruitment and selection, performance evaluations, and professional development.
   Sub-Component 2.2: Upgrading and expanding the Capacity of SIAFI. This sub-
    component helped to develop a set of norms, methodologies, and computer-based
    systems to allow the Government to prepare an effective and transparent budget
    compatible with the PRS. Activities under this sub-component included: (i)
    acquisition of software, communications and computer equipment, and data links and
    licenses to use servers for the upgrading and expansion of web based e-SIAFI, as well
    as preparation of an “e-SIAFI users manual?; and (ii) a review of the Central
    Government’s financial accounts.
   Sub-Component 2.3: Strengthening the Institutional Capacity to Ensure
    Accountability through Internal and External Control. This sub-component was
    geared to assist the Supreme Audit Institution (Tribunal Superior de Cuentas - TSC)
    to establish stronger financial controls, thereby instituting greater transparency in
    public financial management. Activities under this sub-component included: (i)
    training of personnel of internal control units from all public sector entities in various
    skills related to new regulations and control abilities; and (ii) the acquisition of
    equipment (such as computers and communications) for each area of the TSC.

Project Component 3: Support for Sectoral Activities within the Framework of the PRS

14.     The objective of this component was to support sectoral activities that require
technical assistance to fulfill the actions and conditions specified in the PRSC (three year
program). In this context, technical assistance was to be provided to specific sectors
identified by a Project Steering Committee during Project implementation. To begin, the
following activities in the areas of public infrastructure and service provision were
identified in principle as activities to be supported, but were pending ratification by the
Steering Committee:
   For the telecommunications sector, financial and legal advisors were to be hired to
    assist the Government in restructuring and modernizing HONDUTEL. These advisors,
    together with other consultants, were to help the Government of Honduras to prepare
    new telecommunications legislation and to strengthen the newly established
    telecommunications coordinating unit.

   For the power sector, consultants were to be hired to assist the Government in
    improving the efficiency of the national electricity enterprise (Empresa Nacional de
    Energía Eléctrica - ENEE) including its restructuring. Other activities in this sector
    that could be supported by the fund included: the design of institutional and
    regulatory reforms necessary to improve the performance of the sector; a
    comprehensive study of power tariffs, as well as of various regulatory aspects of the
    power sector, and of mechanisms to stimulate private sector participation. Activities
    could also be undertaken to strengthen the National Commission of Energy (the entity
    in charge of regulating this sector). Finally, technical assistance was to be provided to
    identify and implement viable approaches for providing modern energy services to
    consumers in rural and semi-urban areas.

                                              5
   For the ports sector, activities included technical assistance geared to help the
    Government restructure the National Ports Company. In addition, consultants were to
    be hired to strengthen the organizational capacity of the regulatory entity in line with
    the new Ley General de Puertos, and supporting efforts of attracting private
    investment for other ports.
   For the water sector, activities included supporting the National Planning Board for
    Water and Sanitation (CONASA) as well as strengthening the Water Sector Regulator
    for Water and Sanitation (ERSAPS). To support CONASA, a technical manager, a
    planning expert, a decentralization expert, an economist, and an information systems
    specialist were to be contracted. In ERSAPS, an economist, two engineers, and a
    lawyer were to be contracted. Other activities in this sector that could be supported
    included: support for an information campaign aimed at the general public, NGOs,
    Municipalities and Government in general on the reforms introduced by the 2003
    Water Law. Finally, the project was to provide technical equipment (computers and
    software) to allow both agencies to operate efficiently.
   For the environmental sector, consultants were to be hired to improve the quality and
    accuracy of information. Using this improved data, consultants were to review the
    sector’s policies and regulatory framework. Other activities in this sector that could
    be supported included: workshops to strengthen capacity to conduct environmental
    risk assessments, and a comprehensive diagnosis of key areas to determine necessary
    institutional reforms in the sector.
   For the social sectors, consultants were to be hired to produce a feasibility study to
    expand the role of local education development associations with special attention to
    basic infrastructure, transportation networks, and health; and a comprehensive teacher
    allocation post review (auditoría de puestos) was to be carried out in the departments
    of Francisco Morazán and Cortés. Teacher allocation post review could later be
    extended to cover other departments.

15.      A Steering Committee was responsible for identifying and approving sectoral
activities within the context of the PRSC that were supported under this sub-component.
Detailed procedures governing the identification and approval of sectoral activities were
outlined in the project Operational Manual.

Project Component 4: Manage PRSTAC Implementation

16.     This component financed the provision of technical assistance, equipment,
training and operating costs, as necessary, to establish, operate and strengthen the Project
Coordination Unit and Project Execution Units to enable these units to effectively
coordinate, monitor and evaluate (including periodic audits) the implementation of the
project activities.

1.6 Revised Components

17.    The components were not formally revised during project implementation.
However, as mentioned in section 1.3, activities of Component 2 were adapted to reflect
the Government decision to approve a Regulatory Decree instead of passing a new Civil

                                             6
Service Law as initially laid out in the PAD. In 2009, as part of donor cooperation and
joint preparation of a follow-up operation, a sub-component under Component 2 was
added to support the Oficina Normativa de Contratación y Adquisiciones del Estado
(ONCAE). The objectives of this sub-component were (i) to set-up a national
procurement platform, (ii) to implement a regulatory framework on public procurement,
and (iii) to conduct training on the framework and the preparation of procurement plans.
These incorporations were not formally processed through an amendment of the credit
agreement, but agreed upon in a number of aide memoires.

1.7 Other significant changes

18.      There were a number of significant changes during the project:

     Additional Trust Funds. In 2008, additional funds (TF091447) in the amount of
      US$4.63 million for the professionalization of the civil service and the
      implementation of SINACORP were received from the Government of Sweden.
      Furthermore, the Government of Japan granted funds (TF056792) in the amount of
      US$471,000 to strengthen the assistance for capacity building in Honduras. This
      grant was executed by the Ministry of Finance.
     Changes in implementation arrangement. In April 2010, as a result of organizational
      changes by the new administration, a new project implementation unit (PIU) at the
      Secretary of the Presidency, the Unidad Administradora de Proyectos de la
      Secretaría del Estado en el Despacho Presidencial (UAP-SDP) and a new technical
      assistance unit Unidad de Apoyo Técnico Presidencial (UATP) were established. The
      UAP-SDP assumed the implementation responsibilities formerly carried out by the
      Comisión Presidencial de Modernización del Estado (CPME), and the UATP
      assumed the responsibilities of the former Unidad de Apoyo Técnico (UNAT). Key
      personnel for the implementation of the project remained the same despite this change.
     Extensions of the credit and the associated TFs. The closing date of the credit was
      extended four times. The first two extensions mainly reflected the one-year delay in
      effectiveness and slow progress in implementation. In December 2009, as a
      consequence of paused operations in the country, the Bank approved a 2-months
      unilateral extension. With the new Government in place in January 2010, the fourth
      extension provided the time needed to complete remaining implementation activities.
      The closing dates of the TFs, in accordance with the donors and the Bank, were
      adjusted accordingly.
     Reallocation of funds. In 2008 and 2009, funds were reallocated among expenditure
      categories, in particular to increase funds for consultant and communication services,
      and to finance the additional sub-component on ONCAE.
     Changes in Bank’s monitoring and results framework. During the project’s life time,
      the Bank’s operational procedures and focus on results underwent several changes
      and the design and use of indicators became more sophisticated and integral to
      reporting on development effectiveness. Most notably are the changes in the
      implementation summary and results reporting (ISR) that are filed twice-a-year to
      inform management of progress in Bank-supported operations. Initially, the report


                                              7
   format in 2004 did not require reporting on results indicators. The following format,
   starting in 2005, required reporting of at least one outcome-level and one intermediate
   level indicator. Since 2010, the ISR measures all indicators described in the PAD, and
   puts emphasis on distinguishing outcome level and intermediate outcome level
   indicators. Hence, the Project is being evaluated at closing under a different logic
   than the one applicable during its design. The resulting inconsistency of reporting
   during the project’s lifetime makes the evaluation of the achievement of its results
   indicators more challenging.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.      The quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. Objectives responded to the
Government priorities in the implementation of the PRS, as laid out in the PRSP and the
First PRSP Annual Progress Report 2004. The PRSTAC did not only support the
Government in the implementation of the PRS, which was a condition for the HIPC debt
relief initiative; it also served as a framework for the general modernization process of
the country.

20.     The project design reflected the objectives of the 2003 CAS which were based on
supporting the implementation of the PRS process. The CAS explicitly contemplated a
PRSTAC as a cross-cutting support vehicle for the policy-based PRS Credits, with the
objective to consolidate reforms in the education sector, assisting the Government to
address civil service reform issues, improving public resource management and
increasing transparency and promoting greater civil society participation in the
formulation, implementation and monitoring of the poverty reduction strategy. The
project furthermore drew on recommendations from the CFAA 2004 and the CPAR 2004
and built upon the previous EFMTAC, integrating lessons learned and continuing most of
the reforms initiated under this project.

21.     As continuation of the EFMTAC project and technical assistance for the planned
PRSCs, the project enjoyed strong Government commitment and could count on an
existing implementation structure. Two external donors (Sweden and the UK) provided
co-financing, not only adding financial resources and flexibility, but also contributing to
donor alignment and dialogue. The components were in line with the development
objectives, and in particular to support the country’s PRS process. However, the
corresponding indicators were not as flexible and measured specific outcomes; for some
of the indicators a baseline or even a target value was not established. Furthermore, the
delay in project implementation, mainly caused by deficiencies in sequencing the closing
of EFMTAC and initiation of the PRSTAC, suggest shortcomings in implementation
readiness at entry.

22.     The Project´s objective as defined in the project appraisal document was too
broad and overambitious for a project of its nature; for the reasons discussed above, the
objectives reflected more the desired outcomes of the PRS process than those that could
be reasonably achieved through the PRSTAC. However, such broad and ambitious
objectives provided the Bank enough flexibility to adapt and respond to changing

                                            8
circumstances throughout project duration. As a result the PRSTAC was converted into
the main vehicle of dialogue between the Bank and the Government, not only in public
sector modernization issues but also in relation to sectoral activities. At the same time, by
responding to the evolving operation environment the project switched its focus;
activities were adjusted in several components making it difficult to monitor the
achievement of indicators and to adequately evaluate the project outcomes.

23.     The potential risks in meeting the development objectives were correctly
identified and corresponding mitigation measures put into place. The political context
was relatively stable during project preparation, and although the risk of change of
administration with the resulting change of direction and lack of ownership of the
reforms proposed by the project was flagged, the risks of it actually happening were
considered to be low. This suggests that the initial risk rating of “moderate? was mainly
based on the probability of the risk materializing, but did not consider its impact in case it
did materialize. From the ex-post perspective of this evaluation, the risks should have
been rated higher and the proposed mitigation measures integrated more effectively into
the project to enable the team to react to the materialization of those risks. Hence, future
projects should carefully assess the likelihood and the impact of potential risks especially
taking into consideration the political environment.

2.2 Implementation

24.     The project became effective nine months after Board approval and then started
off slowly, because remaining funds under the EFMTAC were used to complete activities,
and the set-up of the multi-donor trust fund was delayed. Yet, activities accompanying
the reforms under the first PRSC were initiated.

25.     Another setback was the 2005 presidential elections that resulted in the change of
the administration and, consequently, of policy priorities. While the Government of
President Zelaya (2006-2009) initially was committed to continuing the PRS process,
policy priorities gradually moved away from the PRS agenda. Country dialogue and the
continuation of the Bank´s involvement in the country was challenged by the significant
changes brought on by the new government and by the favorable macroeconomic
environment Honduras enjoyed during the first years of the Zelaya administration.
During this period, and given the reversal of many critical aspects of the PRS, the PRSC
operations were interrupted while the implementation of the PRSTAC was continued as a
means to maintaining the dialogue in areas of coinciding interest but with lesser
possibilities to support big policy changes (i.e. the civil service law or specific sector
reforms).

26.     As noted in the CAS Progress Report (Report No. 42344-HN, May 8, 2008),
progress had been made in some areas, but favorable macroeconomic conditions and
delays in the completion of measures related to key structural reforms led to the dropping
of the PRSC operations scheduled for FY08 and FY09.

27.    These developments undermined several of the objectives originally supported
under the PRSC/PRSTAC, notably in the area of civil service reform. Support provided
under the PRSTAC was adjusted, with the result that several important reform measures

                                              9
were eventually carried out with PRSTAC support, even though the PRSC series did not
progress beyond the first loan.

28.      The mid-term review conducted in November 2007 recognized these changes, and
it was agreed with the Government to re-allocate funds and to extend the project closing
date. In 2008, a Learning QAG report underlined implementation issues and
recommended maintaining a close and intensive supervision and dialogue with the
government and other stakeholders. These actions then showed positive impact as
consensus with the government on activities was reached and improved implementation
led to rising disbursement rates during 2009.

29.      The removal of President Zelaya from power, followed by a 6-month pause of
Bank operations in the country, interrupted all operations. Its resumption by the newly
elected Government under President Lobo presented further challenges with an
institutional and political framework weakened by the global financial crisis. Yet, the
PRSTAC kept its relevance and was the vehicle to facilitate re-engagement in the country
policy dialogue. Project implementation, however, progressed slowly and concentrated
on a few new policy priorities. Additionally, institutional changes, including the creation
of a new implementation unit, the loss of key personnel in PIUs, and of institutional
memory, further delayed project processes.

30.     In sum, a project that was originally intended to accompany implementation of
the PRS as only one of several instruments in the Bank program served as one of the
most effective means to keep policy dialogue open with the authorities in moments of
dramatic changes in the country context and facilitated the reengagement process
following the political crisis in 2009. Although it is true that original objectives were
different from what was accomplished, it is also fair to provide a critical account of the
situation and explicitly recognize the value of these unintended outcomes of the project,
and the fact that it became one of the few operations the government requested to be
extended through a follow-up operation.

31.      Implementation arrangements were an issue throughout the entire project. The
presence of four executing agencies demanded a major effort in organization and
technical assistance from the implementing agency and the Bank team. These complex
institutional arrangements resulted in delays, lack of coordination and administrative
bottlenecks. Attempts to centralize communications with the Bank resulted in a big
backlog in the implementing agency, which was later reversed, but due to a high
workload in the implementing agency could never fully be resolved.

32.     The fact that the project was never formally restructured drastically reduced the
possibilities of achieving the PDO and indicators, and made it difficult to adequately
record progress made through modified activities. Restructuring the project would have
had allowed to adapt the PDO and indicators to reflect changing circumstances and to
measure and assess the new activities. There have been important advances and
achievements attributable to the project that have not been properly reflected by the
original indicators, such as, the progress made in the public procurement system and
achievements of the Supreme Audit Institution, including the audit of teacher positions.


                                            10
However, when formal restructuring was being considered, the project was near its
closing date, which could have undermined the value-added of the restructuring.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33.    The M&E of the project is rated unsatisfactory, mainly because monitoring and
evaluation arrangements as agreed in the PAD were not put into practice and baseline and
end-of-project targets were not established.

34.     The Results Framework distinguished between four outcome indicators to
measure the PDO, one intermediate result indicator per component (two in the case for
component 2), and three to four result indicators for each component. The 16 result
indicators were generally closely linked to their respective component, sub-components
and activities. This did not reflect the otherwise rather broad description of the
components and activities. Furthermore, more than half of the indicators had no baseline
at project appraisal; one indicator had no yearly and end target.

35.     Monitoring was also challenging as the ISR format on indicators changed several
times during project implementation. The earliest format did not report on indicators at
all. The second format, starting in 2005, reported on four indicators: one “overall?
indicator (taken from one of the indicators measuring the PDO achievement) and three
intermediate outcome indicators. Out of these three intermediate outcome indicators
chosen to be tracked in the ISR, only one was in the set of indicators measuring the PDO
outcome as described in the PAD. The other two were among the results indicators. In
2009, the original PDO indicator was added to the ISR, but could not be measured, as it
depended on four only partially tracked indicators. The final ISR (archived on January 13,
2011) was prepared with the newest ISR structure, which includes all indicators as
described in the PAD, and noted the PDO as moderately satisfactory accordingly.

36.     Consequently, during most of the project implementation, only four of 16 results
indicators were monitored with the ISR. With changes in government priorities and
adjustments of the project’s activities, the relevance of indicators decreased: one indicator
became obsolete, and two indicators could only be measured once, as the basis or data
source changed or became irrelevant. Only one indicator could successfully be measured
throughout implementation.

37.      During the mid-term review in 2007, the Bank team undertook the effort of
establishing missing baseline data and to collect data on the current status of all 16
indicators, even though many of them had become irrelevant for the project, or their
achievements could not be attributed to the project. Neither the failure on measuring the
existing indicators, nor the absence of indicators that could actually measure project
progress brought up the need to formally restructure the project at that time to improve
the M&E framework and align it with the changed priorities and changed project
activities.




                                             11
38.     The Bank team instead concentrated and channeled its M&E efforts through ISRs,
aide memoires and the mid-term review, where it properly reported on project progress,
reorientation and issues.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

39. As a category C project, there were no safeguards issues in the PRSTAC.

40.     The FM performance of the project was either “Moderately Satisfactory? or
“Satisfactory? throughout most of the project life, up to 2009 when the rating was
downgraded to “Moderately Unsatisfactory?, which was maintained up to the closing of
the project. The reasons for the downgrade were related to: (i) non conciliated differences
in the balances of the different designated accounts (credit and associated TFs), (ii)
transfers of funds between the IDA credit and other sources of funds (the co-financed TFs
and counterpart funding), (iii) delays in the presentation of audit reports and Financial
Management Reports and (iv) internal control issues. Except for the first audit report (FY
2005) and the final audit report, audit opinions throughout the project were qualified due
to the above-mentioned reasons.

41.     Due to the high turnover of FM staff in addition to the institutional changes in the
Implementation Agency (with the elimination of the CPME and the creation of the UAP),
the follow-up of the FM issues was delayed. The auditors confirmed in the final report
that no significant FM issues remained at project closing.

42.     The procurement under the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Throughout
the project, the preparation of the Annual Operation and Procurement Plans was delayed.
The selection of individual consultants did not always involve procurement staff, and
consultant contracts used varied by institutions; furthermore, some did not include
clauses on fraud and corruption, and conflict of interest. Insufficiencies were also present
in the conduct of shopping processes, and the use of Honducompras to publish
procurement processes.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

43.     Advances made in the modernization of the Honduran public sector will be
continued and consolidated under the US$15 million follow-up operation Improving
Public Sector Performance Project – IPSP (P110050), scheduled to be presented to the
Board jointly with the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and the first operation in
a series of Development Programmatic Credits in FY12.

44.   The IPSP project is part of a coordinated public sector program among the
German Development Cooperation KfW, Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)
and World Bank. While the IADB operation Honduras Fiscal and Municipal
Management Consolidation Program was approved in October 2008 and started
implementation in 2010, the IPSP project is intended to be implemented in parallel with a


                                            12
€10 million KfW operation, which will focus on activities with the Supreme Audit
Institution.

45.     The IPSP intends to continue the reform efforts made under the PRSTAC in the
areas of financial management systems and monitoring of public policies. A strong focus
of the project will be on the public procurement system and the operationalization of the
Honducompras platform. The IPSP will further give technical assistance in areas
supported by the First Programmatic Development Policy Credit (P127331) in the area
of human resources management.

46.      The project design will incorporate the lessons learned under the PRSTAC, which
will be reflected through a simpler project design, realistic and achievable objectives, and
in institutional arrangements adjusted to the country’s circumstances (see table below).

  Lesson learned from PRSTAC                          Integration into IPSP

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

47.    The project objectives were mainly consistent during project implementation, and
throughout implementation the operation remained important for achieving country, Bank
and global development objectives.



                                              13
48.     The CAS 2007-2010 (Report No. 37280-HN, November 30, 2006) built on the
PRS strategy, representing a continuation of the previous CAS 2003-2006, and
incorporated priorities of the Zelaya Government. Good governance through state
modernization and civic participation represented one of the CAS pillars; transparency,
accountability and the demand for good governance were addressed as cross-cutting
issues. However, the CAS Progress Report (Report No 42344-HN, May 8, 2008) notes
that the originally programmed PRSCs were dropped due to macroeconomic conditions
and delays in the completion of measures related to key structural reforms.

49.    The Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) (Report No. 53517-HO)
concluded that there is a need to strengthen the country’s accountability framework and
to focus the policy discussion on performance. To address weaknesses in the
implementation of public policies, it suggested adopting a new approach towards the
professionalization of the public administration in order to ensure that reforms take into
consideration the country context and become an integral part of public sector
management reforms.

50.     The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) (Report No. 56405-HN, September 29, 2010)
identified intensified support for efforts to improve governance and fight corruption as
one of its four basic principles. Civil service reform and the strengthening of public
financial management and transparency form part of the support for macro stability and
growth.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

51.     Despite slow and interrupted implementation, change in political priorities, and
the broad and ambitious reform agenda, the project made advances towards several
project development objectives. Even though the majority of indicators were not fully
met, progress was made in many areas and achievements from former projects were
consolidated.

52.      As noted in the CAS Progress Report and the ISN, advances had been made in the
area of governance in Honduras, as well as in building stronger relationships with civil
society. Other advances have been reached through the Governance and Anti-Corruption
(GAC) agenda and in fostering transparency, in particular through social audits and the
introduction of an Access to Information Law. However, as noted in the IGR, the country
still faces a lack of transparency and information in the decision-making process, and the
organizational capacity of groups representing public interest remains weak.

PDO 1 (Component 1): Develop government capacity to manage, monitor, evaluate
and improve PRS implementation by giving all stakeholders access to effective
mechanisms for the design and control of the government’s poverty reduction
programs.

53.    Overall project activities contributed to the strengthening of the implementation
and monitoring capacity of the Central Government. A results-based management system
was established, which tracked progress of PRS and Government goals and indicators,
and which introduced a result-oriented mind set in the public sector in Honduras.

                                           14
Analytical capacity was built up in earlier stages of the project through training and
technical assistance; planning methodologies and systems were developed and integrated
in administrative processes. As a result, public expenditure allocated to poverty reduction
programs increased during project implementation. As a result of the turnover of key staff
and the re-structuring of the implementation unit, capacity was lost, but many of the staff
that benefited from the project remain in (or have been called back to work in) the
Central Government.

54.    Significant progress has been made in donor coordination, initiated during the
PRS process. The preparation of strategic plans, engagement with civil society, and the
set-up of sector specific round tables has established a culture of cooperation and
communication among donors, the Government and, to certain extend, civil society.
During, and in particular after the political crisis in Honduras, the donor community
played a crucial role in maintaining the dialogue with the country.

55.     The dialogue with the civil society, initiated under the PRS Consultative Process,
has led to a now established participation of civil society in the areas of transparency and
anti-corruption, in particular through social audits and monitoring initiatives.

56.     Due to the fact that during the project cycle, the PRS process lost its momentum
and, consequently, its importance in the Government’s development agenda, some key
indicators that depended on the PRS process were not met

PDO 2 (Component 2): Improve public sector management by ensuring a more
equitable working environment with better performance incentives and improved civil
service quality, as well as strengthening the Government’s fiscal, financial and
fiduciary management.

57.    A major achievement of this component was the set-up of the integrated human
resource system (SIARH) and its linkage to SIAFI. As a result, today several Central
Government agencies are using SIARH, facilitating automated payments of salaries and
pensions.

58.     Steps towards strengthening the Government’s fiscal, financial and fiduciary
management have been achieved by upgrading SIAFI to a web-based system, and
extending its functions with modules for budget, treasury, accountancy, HR and
administration of goods. As a result, 100 percent of the central government expenditures
are now processed using a single treasury account, constituting a significant improvement
in the financial and fiduciary management. Further advances are needed to connect
decentralized agencies and the public procurement information platform (Honducompras)
to the SIAFI.

59.     The Integrated National Control System for Public Resources (SINACORP)
substantially contributed to the strengthening of the management of public resources.
Implemented by the Supreme Audit Institution (TSC) it supports the country’s external
audit function. The internal control function has been enhanced through the set-up of a
National Office for the Development of Internal Control in Public Institutions
(ONADICI). The TSC managed to link the follow-up of social monitoring outcomes into

                                            15
its processes, to establish guiding frameworks and manuals for internal and external
control and audit, and to train over 2000 public servants. It is also worth mentioning that
the TSC conducted the audit of the teacher posts.

60.     The improvement of the public sector management and the civil service was
mainly dependent on the passing of the new civil service law. But due to lack of political
consensus the law was never presented to Congress; instead, a bylaw on
professionalization of the civil service was passed. Revisions of nearly all public servant
positions and the definition of strategically important positions throughout all secretaries
of the Government, follow-up activities and implementation were never undertaken. As a
result, the envisioned re-engineering process of the public service, the reduction of
Central Government staff and the recruitment through a merit-based system was not
achieved. Similarly, the target to reduce government spending on salaries was not
accomplished.

PDO 3 (Component 3): Support sector specific activities within the framework of the
PRSC for improving public service management and delivery in key economic and
social sectors.

61.     Successful support was given to the decentralization efforts in the water sector to
the municipal level, benefiting over 50 municipalities, nine water associations, and other
stakeholders, inter alia, through situation analysis of the water and sanitation structure,
studies on water price structures and the corresponding operating costs in 15
municipalities, and training and dissemination of the water decentralization law,
administration, operation and maintenance of drainage system, and other water and
sanitation related topics.

62.     Another successful sector support was the conduct of the teacher posts audit,
which was carried out by the TSC upon request by SEFIN. The main finding of the audit
was that the database on teachers is incomplete, unreliable and hence not a proper and
functioning instrument for planning purposes. “Phantom? teachers, duplicate posts, and
unrecorded absenteeism are rampant. Conducting the audit required major political will
and constituted a significant effort on the part of Government. Even further, the findings
provided a platform from which to discuss needed reforms to the sector. The country has
initiated a policy reform dialogue in the education sector, which also involved civil
society through parents’ associations.

63.    Due to changed government priorities, only one of the three initially planned
PRSCs materialized; as a result this component lost its overarching policy reform
framework. Nevertheless, efforts were undertaken to support other sector-specific lending
and technical assistance activities, which resulted in improved inter-sector dialogue.

64.     As for the telecommunication sector, attempts to liberalize the national
telecommunication company (HONDUTEL) failed. Notwithstanding, the tele-
communication sector is much more liberalized today (with four companies vs. two
companies at Project appraisal, and approximately 8 million additional new telephone
lines in the country, mainly mobile phone lines). However, main attribution of this
achievement belongs to the advances in mobile phone technologies, and not the Project.

                                            16
65.     Similarly, the project gave no or minimal support to the power, ports and
environmental sectors. While studies for the restructuring of the national electricity
enterprise (Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica - ENEE) and the national ports
company were conducted, no further actions were taken or significant impact was
achieved. Consequently, ship loading/unloading was not increased.

3.3 Efficiency

66.     As an institutions-building and technical assistance project, computations of rates
of return are difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, as expected in the PAD, economic and
fiscal savings resulting from project activities are likely to have occurred. I.e., the
introduction of a more efficient financial management system paired with increased civil
society involvement has permitted a more transparent and efficient budget process, which
has possibly contributed to financial savings. The improved internal and external control
through the TSC has led to greater accountability and more effective monitoring and
control of financial flows.

67.     Several activities that were part of the PRS process are likely to have had positive
fiscal impacts during the project, but due to the discontinuation of the process these
savings were probably not maintained throughout the end. Examples are a more efficient
alignment of resources through a monitoring system for PRS advances, and an increased
rate of return for public investments through enhanced assessment and analysis capacities.

68.     Considering the small progress made towards the achievement of the PDOs and
the result indicators during the slow and lengthy implementation, the overall efficiency of
the project can be considered as rather low.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.     The most notable achievements of the project are the upgrading of SIAFI to a
web-based system with additional modules, and the consolidation of the independent
Supreme Audit Institution; both have played a crucial role in the improvement of the
Government’s fiscal, financial and fiduciary management. As well, the teacher posts
audit, and the decentralization of the water sector constitute important steps towards
sector reforms. The country had also established a state-of-the-art results-based
management system, which tracked progress of PRS and Government goals and
indicators. Unfortunately, this system was discontinued when the Government decided to
phase out the PRS process.

70.     Through the discontinuation of the PRS many indicators and part of the PDO
became irrelevant, as they were directly linked to the PRS process. The project missed an
opportunity to restructure and to reflect those changes in priorities and activities. As a
result, the PDO was only partially achieved and indicators were not monitored and
measured. As mentioned above, later attempts to restructure the project were deemed
impracticable and unjustified as the remaining project life was only of another year.


                                            17
71.     However, it must be mentioned that the project’s relevance, even in times of
political changes and instability, remained high throughout its implementation. The
PRSTAC became the vehicle for a continuous dialogue with the Government on its
public sector and governance reform agenda, and a flexible instrument to quickly respond
to the client’s needs and priorities. The request for the preparation of a follow-up
operation with mainly the same stakeholders reflects the continuous need for Bank
support in public sector modernization in Honduras. The rating also takes into
consideration the overall rating of the PRSCs as the project has significantly contributed
to the PRS process.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

72.     The project contributed to the implementation of the country’s Poverty Reduction
Strategy, in particular by strengthening planning and monitoring processes. Furthermore,
it supported the PRS consultative process with civil society, as well as stakeholder
dissemination and consultation workshops for the OECD survey on the accomplishment
of the Paris Declaration indicators.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.     Institutional strengthening was a cross-cutting desired impact of this project. The
main institutional change happened at the Supreme Audit Institution, which consolidated
its role as the national independent audit function. However, the reliance in external
consultants’ contributions remains an institutional challenge ahead. Analytical and
implementation capacity was created at the central government level, at the project
implementation unit and the executing agencies. Furthermore, public sector staff and
other stakeholders benefited from training in project-related areas, such as (i) use of the
SIAFI, (ii) internal and external control, (iii) public procurement, and (iv) water
management. It must be noted, that high turnover of staff with the change in
administration could potentially undermine these results.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

74.     As mentioned earlier, the PRSTAC unexpectedly evolved from a small technical
assistance loan to the major vehicle for country dialogue and engagement during several
administrations and critical political circumstances. This enabled the Bank to respond to
specific client demands and to continuously engage, even if marginally, in critical aspects
of the public sector reform agenda in Honduras.

75.     The sector dialogue initiated under the PRSC and the PRSTAC gave the impulse
for operations in the energy (Power Sector Efficiency Enhancement Project
(PROMEF) P104034), water (Honduras Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization
Project- P103881) and the education sectors (Honduras Education Quality, Governance,
& Institutional Strengthening P101218).


                                            18
76.     As noted in the CAS progress report, the approval of the Transparency Law
represented a significant advance in the governance reform agenda in Honduras. The
Transparency and Access to Information Law came into force in January 2008, followed
by the creation of the Access to Information Institute, and the appointment of public
information officers and information offices in most public institutions. The project
supported the GAC dialogue around the approval of the law, and gave operational
support to the IDF which contributed to finance the creation of the Access to Information
Institute.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

12.    No beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops were undertaken for the
preparation of this ICR.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

77.     The risk to Development Outcome is rated as Substantial as institutional capacity
remains weak and the sustainability of the achievements continue to depend on the
political will and commitment to sustain and advance governance reforms. The follow-up
operation builds on achievements made and intends to consolidate the PRSTAC
outcomes.

78.    The SIAFI and its related modules, including SIARH, enjoyed strong ownership
for a period of time and were well established within the public administration. Even
throughout changing administrations, the SIAFI remained a priority. However, the
maintenance and further development of SIAFI will depend on the availability of
continued financing and uninterrupted political support.

79.     The continuation of the support and development of the national control system
SINACORP is restrained by dependence on external finance. With the closing of the
PRSTAC, the TSC is working with minimum capacity and resources, and had to a
discontinue support given by specialists (mostly consultants). The institution will receive
further donor support and financing by the KfW, which intends to focus its involvement
in Honduras on the TSC.

80.     Continuous the communication among the donor community will act as a
platform for constant donor coordination and aid harmonization. It will also maintain and
further develop the coordination and implementation capacity of development programs.
However, much of this human capital depends on external financing, and is not formally
integrated into the government’s capacity.

81.     Civil society involvement and increased transparency has started to anchor in
society and the government, and informed, conscious and organized civil society groups
are continuing advances in social monitoring and civil participation. However, there is an
increasing risk that these civil society groups are being captured by power groups to
advance their political agendas.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.     The Bank, together with the donor community, strongly supported Honduras’
PRS process and its public sector modernization agenda. The PRSTAC together with a
series of PRSCs were designed to support the country’s PRSP and its implementation
process, in particular in the technical aspects of control mechanisms, monitoring,
implementation, and analytical capacity, and the involvement of civil participation in the
PRS process. Reform was supported not only in the public administration, but also to
important public service sectors, such as water and sanitation, electricity and education.
Analytical work, such as the CFAA and the CPAR, as well as CAS objectives were taken
into consideration and integrated into the project design. The PRS process enjoyed high
Government commitment at the time of the appraisal, and the project responded to the
demands and needs of the client.

83.      The PRSTAC continued achievements made under the EFMTAC project, and was
able to build on an existing structure of project implementation capacity. However, the
country’s history of slow implementation should have been considered while designing
the implementation arrangements. In fact, implementation of the PRSTAC was delayed,
as remaining funds under the EFMTAC were used to complete activities, and the set-up
of the multi-donor trust fund was delayed. During implementation the presence of five
implementing units, coordinated by one coordination unit proved to be a bottleneck for
timely implementation and fiduciary aspects in a setting with low coordination and weak
institutional capacities.

84.     The results framework was well aligned with the expected outcomes of the PRS
process and the project components. However, lacking baseline data at project initiation,
weak monitoring and shortcomings of communicating the state of indicators to the client,
resulted in irregular reporting on the framework.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.     As in the early stages of the project, most of the supervision team was based in
Washington, in the later years the fiduciary teams (Financial Management and
Procurement Specialists) were based in the country office, allowing just-in-time support
to the counterpart. Support from other country office staff, including the country manager,
contributed to the good working relationship and continuous involvement with the
changing administrations. The PRSTAC had four task team leaders, and transition
processes might have slightly slowed down implementation. Only in one case was the
incoming team leader already a team member and familiar with the project and the
country, hence facilitating the transition process.

                                           20
86.     Shortcomings in the quality of supervision are the missed opportunities to
restructure the project and to adjust the PDO and/or the results framework according to
new government priorities. Opportunities to reconsider the relevance and achievability of
the PDO were, for example, the agreement with the government on passing the bylaw on
the professionalization of the civil service instead of a new civil service law; the
agreement in 2006 not to meet the target for public expenditure for poverty reduction
programs, and the mid-term review, which showed that many of the initial components
and the results framework did not reflect the actual reality of the project. As a result, most
ISR ratings reflect a satisfactory or moderately satisfactory progress, which in
retrospective seem to have been overoptimistic. It must be noted that the Learning QAG
report carried out in 2008 stated the need to maintain the close and intensive supervision
of the project, but provided no rating or further recommendation on project supervision
and implementation, nor did it flag the need to restructure.

87.     The difficult and changing country and political context interrupted
implementation and supervision per se several times. Nevertheless, the task team
maintained a continuous dialogue using the PRSTAC as the platform and as a tool to
react to upcoming needs and Government demands. The flexible design of the project and
in particular the flexible use of the Swedish TFs allowed adjusting activities without
formal restructuring.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

88.    Despite the quality of the project at appraisal, which correctly identified and
captured the Government’s development program and the Bank´s proposed strategy for
the country; supervision had several shortcomings with task teams failing to restructure
the project (even though as mentioned before, project was adapted to changing
circumstances) and to monitor its progress. Yet, the task team´s effort to maintain an
open dialogue and to respond to the Government´s request for assistance under
challenging circumstances should be acknowledged as it permitted the Bank to maintain
engagement with the country and advance on important reforms.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

89.     As the project was directly linked to the country’s PRSP and the PRS process,
Government ownership and commitment during preparation was high. The PRS process
and the PRSTAC enjoyed government support, and the cooperation with the Bank and
other donors was effective. Unfortunately, consensus for passing the new civil service
law was not reached before the change in administration. While the following
government was initially committed to the PRS process, the focus of priorities shifted and
political commitment for the implementation of various components (and the
achievement of the PDO) decreased significantly. This affected especially the civil

                                             21
service reform and the support for sector activities. After the political crisis in 2009 and
the 6-months pause of Bank operations, the newly elected government re-engaged in
policy dialogue with the Bank, with the project and its activities serving as a platform and
means for addressing the new Government’s priorities. However, changing Government
priorities and a volatile political environment paired with a lack of political will and
country ownership during most of the project’s life significantly contributed to the low
performance of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

90.    This project was implemented by up to five implementing agencies and one
coordination unit, which was in charge of the fiduciary aspects and reported directly to
the Secretary of the Presidency. The implementing agencies generally showed
commitment for the implementation of their respective components and the
corresponding objectives. Nevertheless, they were dependent on political decisions, and
often had to struggle with lack of political support, as well as insufficient personal and
technical capacity. This directly influenced fiduciary aspects of the implementation, with
continuous delays and unsatisfactory performance in procurement and financial
management processes.

91.     The coordination unit was responsible for handling a broad portfolio of
development projects, resulting in work overload which hindered smooth project
implementation. The existing number of staff and technical capacities were insufficient
and made it difficult to efficiently handle the portfolio, which in turn negatively
influenced the fiduciary performance. Considering these circumstances, the unit, and in
particular a core team, dedicated considerable efforts and time to the project.

92.      Insufficient transition arrangements between governments slowed down
implementation progress, as project knowledge and information was not sufficiently
handed over to the incoming staff. The combination of the general lack of capacity and
technical skills in the administrative body and the country in general, and the major part
of staff appointments being politically motivated, led not only to high turn-over rates, but,
in many cases, also to weak staffing of (key) positions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

93.    This rating is based on the difficulties in implementation and achievement of the
development objective described above.




                                             22
6. Lessons Learned

94.     The main lesson learned is that the project and its implementation arrangements
need to be carefully designed and adapted to respond to the country’s circumstances.
Firstly, the political context is volatile, political will is not constant and country
ownership is generally low. Secondly, implementing capacity is weak and technical skills
limited, resulting in a slow implementation pace. Recruiting and sustaining technically
skilled staff is difficult, time-consuming and often undermined by political appointments
without the matching professional profiles. Furthermore, the number of externally-
financed projects has led to a heavy workload of the UAP at the Secretary of the
Presidency, causing bottlenecks through a lack of communication, planning and technical
assistance to the executing agencies. The following provides recommendations for the
preparation of the follow-up project:

   Keep project design simple and realistic with results indicators specifically
    calibrated and linked to the activities financed by the project. In addition, design
    the M&E arrangement around available data and existing systems in Government or
    relevant external and reliable monitors.

   Avoid fragmented implementation arrangements that can slow down the project.
    Involvement of several executing agencies, which are coordinated by one
    implementing agency, causes fragmentation and makes communication difficult.
    While complex public sector reforms might require the involvement of several
    agencies, these might actually interfere with the achievement of the project objective.
        Make sure that there is enough staff dedicated to the project
        Consider the introduction of the figure of a Project Coordinator
        Involve technical agencies/staff and enhance communication
        Prepare operational plans on a longer-term basis
        Consider to concentrate on a few specific public sector reforms instead of
           trying to cover a wide range of reforms

   Employ available Bank tools to improve prospects for achieving project
    development objectives at exit. Restructuring should be seen as a helpful instrument
    to adjust the project, especially in an environment like Honduras
   Project flexibility enhances client responsiveness. Implementation took place
    during three elected Governments and a pause in Bank operations. Flexibility in
    financing activities and categories through a Swedish Trust fund gave the PRSTAC
    the opportunity to respond to the changing needs of the country, and to act as a
    vehicle of dialogue for the Government and the Bank. However, flexibility should not
    go beyond the core focus of the project, but assure that the final goal is the
    achievement of the PDO.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

95.    The Borrower provided the Bank with their project completion report and
comments on this ICR (see Annex 7). The main issues raised were related to performance
and their corresponding ratings of the implementing and executing units and the project
M&E.

96.     While the Borrower’s completion report considers the performance of the
implementing and executing units “satisfactory?, the Bank’s rating is “moderately
unsatisfactory?. This rating derives from the fact that the ICR considers the project design
characteristic of having four executing and one coordinating agency as being too complex.
Delays in the implementation process are therefore attributed to this complexity as well
as the high workload of the UAP, as the unit was in charge of a large number of projects.
Furthermore, during implementation and during the preparation of the ICR, this issue had
been raised several times by the UAP itself.

97.     Borrower comments on the Bank’s assessment and rating of M&E and
achievement of PDO state that the described shortcomings should be mainly attributed to
the changed project focus. While this ICR describes the circumstances and reasons of the
difficulties to monitor project progress, the actual outcomes and outputs of the project are
compared and rated against the formally agreed results framework. Unfortunately, the
significant changes of the project have not been reflected through an update of this
framework, leaving the original, even though outdated one, as the only base against
which to measure results. The ratings and its explanations specifically and the ICR in
general tries to objectively illustrate the facts.

98.     Other comments raised by the Borrower have been duly noted by the Bank team.
All comments raised have been carefully taken into consideration during the preparation
of the follow-up operation and most have been included in the lessons learned sections.

(b) Cofinanciers

99.     Annex 8 presents the comments received by the Swedish Development Agency
SIDA. The main issues raised were donor coordination and the significance of the
staffing choices to achieve progress on the government side.

100. While the ICR recognizes the excellent donor coordination in the policy dialogue
with the country, SIDA has pointed out shortcomings in the administrative coordination
and communication among donors. This has been reflected in the lessons learned within
the general need of improving communication within project participants.

1.1 Develop UNAT’s Analytical Capacity: Coordinator, research staff and consultants
were hired and supported the planning process through the preparation of annual progress
reports on the PRS process. This also included the preparation of Poverty and Social

officials and Planning and Evaluation Units with training and technical assistance in areas
of strategic planning, results-based management, and institutional and sectoral goals and
their linkage to the PRS global indicators. A results-based management system was
developed, which tracked progress of PRS and Government goals and indicators.

beginning of the project, such as the PSIAs, decreased to be used during the project’s life
cycle and work was focused on monitoring. Eventually, in early 2010, the UNAT was
dissolved and its responsibilities were distributed among the newly formed Secretary of
Planning (SEPLAN) and the UATP. The indicators measuring the percentage of public
expenditure allocated to poverty reduction related programs were last measured in 2007
(9.1percent). The Bank team was informed that due to a lack of fiscal space, the
Government, in accordance with the Bank had agreed in 2006, to not meet this indicator.

1.2 Strengthen the Government’s Capacity to Coordinate Foreign Assistance: this
component supported three main activities: (i) a strategic plan on alignment and
harmonization of foreign assistance, (ii) dissemination workshops and consultative
process on the OECD survey on the accomplishment of the Paris Declaration indicators,
and (iii) sector specific round tables. The preparation of sector-wide programs, as planned
in the PAD, was never realized, however, the Millennium Development Goals Report for
Honduras 2010 states that in 2008, 38.7 percent (US$218.8 million) of the official
development aid is channeled towards social sectors; of which 26 percent benefit the
education and 14 percent the health sector. The biggest part with 36 percent supports
governance and civil society.

1.3 Enhance the PRS Consultative Process: The work of the PRS Consultative Council
was supported through technical assistance and the purchase of office equipment.
Furthermore, information workshops and consultative processes with communities to

update the PRS process were conducted, but not continued after 2007. The ultimate
objective of this sub-component was to create a viable system of social audits as part of
the national poverty monitoring system, and to support the PRS Consultative Council to
implement decentralized regional strategies. By 2007, 47 social audits at community
level were conducted by the National Commission for Human Rights (CONADEH), and
today, social audits and monitoring have been widely established in the Honduras civil
society landscape. However, it is not clear, to what extend the project and Consultative
Council has contributed to this progress.

2.1 Implement the new civil service legislation and continue efforts to reengineer the
public sector: The main achievement of the civil service component is the successful set-
up of the integrated human resource system (SIARH) and its linkage to SIAFI. Today, the
entire Central Government and two decentralized agencies are using SIARH; it also
incorporated pension and scholarship payments. Due to lack of political consensus, the
new Civil Service Law, as envisioned during project preparation, was never submitted to
Congress. Instead, a bylaw to the existing civil service law was passed, backing-up the
professionalization plan for the public service. In this regard, the DGSC undertook an
extensive exercise reviewing and preparing descriptions of nearly all public servant
positions. The unit also reviewed and defined strategically important positions similar
throughout all secretaries of the Government in the areas of public administration,
financial management, planning, procurement, HR and internal audit. The objective was
to identify those positions to protect them from politically-motivated personnel
replacements, which take place with each newly elected government. However, actions to

                                                27
follow these studies and reports did not occur. As the objective and outcomes, as
proposed in the PAD, were mainly based on and linked to support the implementation of
a new civil service law, many of the planned activities could not be carried-out and
expected results could not be met. Similarly, the targets to reduce government spending
on salaries, the reduction of positions and introduction of a competitive recruitment
process were not achieved.

2.2 Upgrading and expanding the capacity of SIAFI: The upgrading of the SIAFI is
one of the success stories of the project. The country operates today an integrated
financial management system with all central government agencies using the real time
information produced by the web-based SIAFI. During the project life, modules for
budget, treasury, accountancy, HR and administration of goods were added, and more
than 8,000 users were trained in their use. Consequently, 100 percent of the central
government expenditures are processed using the single treasury account (STA). SIAFI
also features public access, although there is room to make public consultation easier to
access, allowing citizens to request and download information on budget execution has
been a notable step forward in Honduras. On the other side, of the decentralized agencies,
only the national electricity enterprise (ENEE) is connected to SIAFI and none to the
STA, mainly because the law does not mandate the integration of the agencies into SIAFI.
The public procurement system (Honducompras) has been developed by the National
Procurement Agency, and efforts will be conducted to link it to SIAFI.

2.3 Strengthening institutional capacity to ensure accountability through internal
and external control: The support to the Supreme Audit Institution (Tribunal Superior
de Cuentas – TSC) was a follow-up component on the EFMTAC project, which
supported the constitution of the TSC. Today, the institution has assumed all its
responsibilities and is operating as a fully independent institution. While the PAD
foresaw mainly office equipment for the TSC, and training for the TSC and the internal
audit offices, the completed activities exceeded this initial objective. Early in the project,
priority was given to the implementation of an Integrated National Control System for
Public Resources (SINACORP), and the connection of social audits through civil society
organizations to the external auditing process of the TSC. Activities related to the internal
audit units were intended to be executed under the Project to Strengthen Control of Public
Resources - PAFICORP (part of SINACORP) through the set-up of a National Office for
the Development of Internal Control in Public Institutions (ONADICI). Main
achievements under this component were: (i) follow-up of social audits outcomes into the
processes of the TSC, (ii) development and implementation of SINACORP, (iii) set-up of
ONADICI, (iv) guiding frameworks for internal and external control and audit, (v)
manuals in topics related to internal and external control, and (vi) training of over 2000
public servants in areas of internal and external control. It is also worth mentioning, that
the TSC conducted the audit of the teachers post described in subcomponent 3.6.

Additional activities: Supporting ONCAE (Oficina Normativa de Contratación y
Adquisiciones del Estado): With support of the IADB, ONCAE had started to develop
and set-up HONDUCOMRPAS, a platform to publish and manage government purchases
and contracts. In 2009, parts of the projects funds were allocated to continue the on-going
work of the national procurement agency ONCAE. The objectives of this sub-component

                                             28
were (i) to set-up a national procurement platform, (ii) to implement a regulatory
framework on public procurement, and (iii) to conduct training on the framework and the
preparation of procurement plans.

Honducompras has been developed by the National Procurement Agency (ONCAE), but
still faces major development needs. The current platform only allows for: (i) the
publication of all business opportunities and associated results, but to date compliance is
very low, (ii) publication of agency procurement plans, and (iii) partial registration of
suppliers. ONCAE delivered a large number of training sessions on the national
procurement framework and the preparation of procurement plans to government
agencies, including hospitals and entities on the departmental level. This training has
proven to be an advance but has been clearly insufficient to generate a change in culture
as to the way governmental entities procure goods and services. In November 2010,
ONCAE opened an office for transparency and client service.

 22,000 teacher posts audited                                  Achieved.

3.1 Telecommunications Sector: A draft bill for the restructuring of HONDUTEL was
prepared and submitted to Congress, but never approved. Independently from the project,
the telecommunication sector underwent liberalization and as a result there are now four
companies offering landline and mobile phone services (vs. two companies at Project
appraisal). Mainly due to the extreme progress in mobile technology, the country counts a
total of approximately 8 million additional new telephone lines (mainly mobile phone
lines) since appraisal (www.conatel.gob.hn).

3.2 Power Sector: A consultancy for the restructuring of the national power company
ENEE was carried out. As for the indicators, no data on the current coverage of rural
electrification was available. However, the total coverage has increased to 81.27 percent
in 2010, compared to 64.64 percent at project appraisal (www.enee.gob.hn).

3.3 Ports Sector: A couple of consultancies on restructuring of the National Ports
Company, as well as privatization possibilities were undertaken, but after a change of
Government, their recommendations were not implemented and partial results were not
followed up. In the last year of the Project, a study on PPP possibilities for the Port of
Castilla was prepared, but no further actions have been taken. In regard to the indicators,


                                                29
the number of ships that were loaded/unloaded in Honduran ports in 2010, decreased
slightly from 2269 ships in 2004 to 2162 ships in 2010 with no major discrepancies
during this time period. Likewise, the TEUs 1 handled in the ports decreased from
592,460 TEUs in 2004 to 484,148 TEUs in 2010, after having reached lows of 507 TEUs
in 2005 and 484 TEUs in 2009 and peaking at 572 TEUs in 2008. (Empresa Nacional
Portuaria, www.enp.hn)

3.4 Water and Sanitation: Successful support was given to the decentralization efforts
of the water sector to the municipal level, benefiting over 50 municipalities, nine water
associations, 70 staff of water and sanitation entities, and individual water consultants.
Main activities included: (i) situation analysis of the water and sanitation structure in 12
municipalities, facilitating the assumption of responsibilities by municipalities, (ii)
studies on water price structures and the corresponding operating costs in 15
municipalities, (iii) training and dissemination of the water decentralization law,
administration, operation and maintenance of drainage system, and other water and
sanitation related topics, (iv) preparation of an investment plan, identifying the water
access gaps and financial requirements for infrastructure upgrading, (v) support of the
National Water and Sanitation Council (CONASA) in the form of office equipment and
studies on the situation of water services in over 30 municipalities, and (vi) support of the
water sector regulating entity (ERSAPS) through diagnostics of the status of the water
structure in 33 municipalities.

No indicator was designed to measure this subcomponent. The PAD states the
strengthening of CONASA and ERSAPS as the main objectives. With the completed
activities exceeding this initial objective and having given substantive support to the
decentralization process, the objective of this subcomponent is considered achieved.

3.5 Environmental Sector: No activities were undertaken.

3.6 Social Sector: An audit on the teacher allocation post was conducted by the TSC,
verifying the existence of teachers and posts as described in the Government’s database.
Results were never published by the government, but as part of the PETS (Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey) and in cooperation with the Community-based Education
Project (P007397) and the IADB, successfully sample survey was conducted and
presented to the Government in November 2010. The main finding was that the database
on teachers is incomplete, unreliable and hence not a proper and functioning instrument
for planning purposes. “Phantom?-teachers and unrecorded absenteeism is high; the study
estimates that up to US$19 million are lost on phantom teachers each year.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

As an institutions-building and technical assistance project, quantitative computations of
rates of return are difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, as expected in the PAD, economic
and fiscal savings resulting from project activities are likely to have occurred. i.e., the
introduction of a more efficient financial management system paired with increased civil
society involvement has permitted a more transparent and efficient budget process, which
has possibly contributed to financial savings. The improved internal and external control
through the TSC has lead to greater accountability and more effective monitoring and
control of financial flows.

Several activities that were part of the PRS process are likely to have had positive fiscal
impacts during the project, but due to the discontinuation of the process these savings
were probably not maintained throughout the end. Examples are a more efficient
alignment of resources through a monitoring system for PRS advances, increased rate of
return for public investments through enhanced assessment and analysis capacities.

Considering the small progress made towards the achievement of the PDOs and the result
indicators during the slow and lengthy implementation, the overall efficiency of the
project can be considered as rather low.

7.1 Summary of the Borrower Completion Report2

During the first semester of 2011, the Government of Honduras produced a completion
report of the credit and its associated trust funds. The document contains a description of
the project’s background, and its objectives and components as stated in the PAD and the
legal agreement, as well as performance rating for the Borrower and the Bank, and
recommendations on the sustainability of the project.

The report the points out the main achievements of the project as follow:
    Update and implementation of the PRS consultation process, strengthening of
       capacity and analytical skills of the PRS Consultative Council.
    Strengthening of the implementation units, and linkage of institutional and
       sectoral goals with the global PRS indicators.
    Expansion and integration of the integrated HR system in SIAFI.
    Conceptualization of the new civil service regulator’s structure and functions.
    Purchase of furniture and other equipment for the civil service regulator.
    Training in classification of positions, recruitment selection and performance
       evaluation delivered to HR staff.
    Studies and consulting services on the evaluation of fiscal impact and implication
       on salaries in the public sector were conducted.
    Training in topics of public debt, integrity and ethics, financial auditing,
       evaluation of the chart of accounts, public procurement and other delivered to the

      Studies and consulting services on the evaluation of fiscal impact and implication
       on salaries in the public sector were conducted to assure fiscal sustainability of
       the borrower.
      Organizational structures of selected pilot organizations were re-engineered, and
       an analysis of HR missing to effectively implement civil service reforms in those
       institutions was conducted. Also, e-government strategies were implemented.
      Current staff and new recruitments in the pilot institutions were evaluated to
       initiate the implementation of the new legislation. Capacity was developed in the
       pilot institutions to apply the new HR policies with regard to classification of
       positions, recruitment selection, performance evaluation and career development.

Following, the report features a section on the design and implementation of the project,
which describes the main activities, objectives and achievements for each component (by
implementing agency). In addition to the achievements and activities mentioned above,
the report states the achievements made by the National Procurement Agency ONCAE:
     Preparation and launch of module for a simplified registration of suppliers, and
        the registration of annual procurement plans on the platform Honducompras (33
        institutions have published their procurement plans).
     More than 3,000 purchase processes have been published, and the website
        receives an average of 500 visits daily.
     All public institutions have a unified tool for the preparation of tender documents.
     Training has been delivered to a total of 91 public institutions, including hospitals.
     Opening of a transparency center for the public .

Borrower Performance
The performance of the coordinating unit and the executing agencies is rated satisfactory,
even though not all of the funds could be executed nor all activities completed due to the
“pause? of Bank operations as a reaction to the political events from June 2009.

The CPME and the UAP-SDP as coordinating units complied with administrative and
financial responsibilities by assuring the availability of funds for the executing agencies.

                                            36
Those agencies complied by preparing financial reports using the established accounting
procedures. Each executing unit keeps a proper archive on all the supporting documents
which justify the use of assigned resources for each component.

The procurement processes were conducted in a transparent way, following the
recommendations received from the Bank and applying the corresponding guidelines and
rules. This is reflected in the evaluation and audit reports.

Bank Performance
The resident Bank mission played a key role and maintained communication with the
important entities.

The technical and administrative team in Washington gave continued constant support to
the project and responded to all requests made by the executing agencies. The team
visited the project in numerous occasions, and delivered training in the procurement and
financial management which contributed to professional development of the executing
agency’s staff.

Sustainability of the Project
SEFIN has developed an action plan to convert the technical personnel into permanent
staff to avoid high turn-over rates as a result of instable contract situations. Since May
2010, the Government of Honduras is financing all staff with national funds and it is
planned to convert them into permanent staff in 2011. To assure technical sustainability,
a sustainability component has been included in a new loan by the IADB (Loan 2032),
which included activities to improve the server capacity, a back-up site and the
certification of SIAFI.

The Supreme Audit Institution (TSC) prepares its annual budget based in the needs to
continue the implementation of the developed mechanisms with the objective to comply
efficiently with its function. The advances made under the project and through the
Swedish TF are not enough to fully achieve the general objective of SINACORP, but
need immediate support to assure continuity, completion and consolidation of the results
achieved by the end of the project in December 2010. The next phase will be financed by
the KfW, and the TSC is working closely on the documents that will be the base for this
future cooperation.

The DGSC considers the following activities necessary to assure the sustainability of its
component: i) editing of the new civil service law and its regulatory framework, ii)
complete auditing the positions in the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Transport,
iii) complete the update of the positions manual, iv) strengthening the technical units of
DGSC through additional staff, extended physical space, purchase of equipment, training,
and other, v) continue the recruitment of HR specialists for the sustainability of the
SIARH, and vi) logistical support for the implementation of new SIARH modules.

The reforms in the water sector need further consolidation of the regulatory bodies and
the implementation of the Strategic Modernization Plan for the Water and Sanitation
Sector (PEMAPS). This would support to achieve the objectives of the framework law

                                           37
and guarantee the delivery of efficient quality services. As part of the PROMOSAS
project these reforms are continued and expect to achieve the following objectives: i)
improve sustainability, efficiency and responsibility of the water and sanitation services
in eligible municipalities, ii) improve the performance of the national institutions and the
compliance with the law.

The PROMEF project is continuing the achievements made in the energy sector. It
mainly concentrates on the improvement of the financial and operational performance of
the energy company ENEE, as well as upgrading the distribution network and
strengthening the institutional capacity and corporate governance of ENEE.

7.2 Summary of Comments from Implementing Agency on the Draft ICR

The task team received the following comments on the draft ICR:

1) On section 1.7 “Other significant changes?: With the change of the project’s
implementing agency only part of the key personnel transferred from the former CPME
to the newly created UAP-SDP.

2) Section 2.2 “Implementation? refers in paragraph 8 to the issues resulting from having
four executing agencies. The implementing agency (UAP) carried out its tasks of quality
control and consolidation of operational plans according to the implementation
arrangements of the Project. Furthermore, the coordination was undertaken involving all
concerned parties and communication with the Bank was never centralized.

3) Regarding the “unsatisfactory? rating of the M&E (Section 2.3), both the Bank and the
Government should be hold accountable, based on the paragraph from the ICR reading:
At the same time, by responding to changing requests the project switched its focus;
activities were adjusted in several components making it difficult to monitor indicators
achievements and to evaluate the project. (Section 2.1)

4) As for the Section 2.4 on “Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance?, as per
recommendation of the Bank, procurement personnel did not take part in evaluation
committees, and that the format used for contracts was approved by the Bank, while it
was agreed to change the format under a new loan. Furthermore, comments state that the
CPME always published its contracts in Honducompras, as they were a pilot of this
system. To avoid generalizing it would be useful to specify the executing agencies to
which the insufficiencies in the processes refer to.

5) In Section 3.2 “Achievement of Project Development Objectives?, the description
under PDO 3 refers to a study on the restructuring of the electricity ENEE. This
consultancy was not carried out under the PRSTAC.

6) The conclusion of the Section 3.3 on “Efficiency? reads the following: “Considering
the small progress made towards the achievement of the PDOs and the result indicators
during the slow and lengthy implementation, the overall efficiency of the project can be
considered as rather low.? This statement seems contradictory. During several missions,

                                            38
the Bank stated that no evaluation of indicators would be done as they were obsolete, so
it is not clear why they are being considered in the ICR.

7) Section 3.4 “Justification of Overall Outcome Rating? states that the results-based
system introduced by the Government was discontinued when the Government decided to
phase out the PRS process. This system was actually interrupted during the “pause? and
is currently being re-installed.

8) In Section 5.1 (a) “Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry? states that
“During implementation the presence of five implementing units, coordinated by one
coordination unit proved to be a bottleneck for timely implementation and fiduciary
aspects in a setting with low coordination and weak institutional capacities.? This
statement seems inappropriate and incorrect. The coordinating unit did at no point delay
the activities of the executing agencies, as they did not depend on the coordinating unit,
as this unit only consolidated POAs, PACs, and managed funds.

9) In Section 5.2 “Borrower Performance?, the justification for the Implementing Agency
or Agencies Performance, the text states that “the combination of the general lack of
capacity and technical skills in the administrative body and the country in general, and
the major part of staff appointments being politically motivated, led not only to high turn-
over rates, but, in many cases, also to weak staffing of (key) positions.? It should be made
clear that this statement refers to the Government as a whole and not specifically to the
UAP.

10) In Section 6 “Lessons Learned? the ICR states that “the number of externally-
financed projects has led to a high workload of the UAP at the Secretary of the
Presidency, causing bottlenecks through a lack of communication, planning and
technical assistance to the executing agencies.? Similarly to the previous comment 8, this
statement seems inappropriate as the UAP despite the high workload responded to the
demands of the project. As mentioned earlier, each executing agency was in charge of
procurement and payment, and therefore the UAP has had no influence on the delays.

11) In Annex 2 “Output by Component?, in Component 3.4 the following additional
achievements in the water and sanitation sector should be mentioned: 45 situation
diagnostics of urban aqueducts, 15 studies on water tariffs, training of 70 technicians,
certification of 25 consultants in the area of water and sanitation regulation certification,
and 22 diagnostics on service delivery institutions.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1) Comments from the Swedish Development Agency (SIDA)

Relevance of development objectives: The objectives were relevant for Honduras, but
some were in particular relevant to the World Bank, such as the strong efforts paid at the
beginning of the implementation of the project to pass a new Civil Service Law and other
legislation processes within the PRSTAC. Such policy processes often have little impact
on institutional strengthening and the Bank should take earlier experiences as lessons-
learned.

Bank performance and cooperation: Bank performance assuring quality at entry and
technical capability during implementation as good. However, coordination with the co-
financier was poor, information was not shared on a regular basis and follow-up had to be
made on financial and audit reports.

Government Performance: Government performance has been satisfactory, especially
during the Maduro Administration. The more technocratic approach that characterized
the Maduro administration suited well the implementation of the PRSTAC.

Implementing Agency Performance: The performance of the implementing agency was
good, but very much linked to the person in the management position.

2) Comments from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)

Compartimos las conclusiones sobre el avance del proyecto, específicamente sobre el
componente para la implementación del sistema SIAFI que cofinanciaron ambos Bancos.
Sobre las recomendaciones del informe nos gustaría puntualizar lo siguiente:

1. En el diseño de la nueva operación, sería conveniente precisar las diferencias de esta
   nueva figura – Coordinador de Proyecto - respecto a la figura de Asesor Técnico
   Principal (ATP) establecida por los préstamos PRSTAC y 1546/SF-HO. En el caso
   del SIAFI, el ATP fue seleccionado por el GHO y ambos Bancos de una terna de
   consultores internacionales. Sus TDRs fueron acordados por todas las partes y el
   consultor seleccionado permaneció desde el arranque del proyecto hasta junio de
   2009. Este consultor tuvo la responsabilidad de coordinar, en forma exclusiva y desde
   el punto de vista técnico, la ejecución de las dos operaciones que financiaban el
   proyecto SIAFI. En nuestra opinión, esta figura de ATP fue clave en los logros del
   componente. Sin embargo, no creemos que es suficiente. Otros componente tuvieron
   ATPS y los resultados no fueron similares.

2. Creo que es importante resaltar la importancia de los estudios previos –ejemplo el
   CFAA- que apoyaron el diseño de la operación y facilitaron el arranque.

3. Es necesario resaltar, también, el apoyo que recibió el proyecto por parte de las
   autoridades de SEFIN, especialmente durante el periodo de crisis, que le dio
   sostenibilidad a los resultados alcanzados hasta la fecha.
