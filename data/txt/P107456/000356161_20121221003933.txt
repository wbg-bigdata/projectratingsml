  CAPE VERDE SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISE CAPACITY BUILDING AND
                 ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE PROJECT

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A.     SUMMARY

1.     This is to seek the Country Director’s approval for a Level 2 restructuring of the Cape
Verde SME & Economic Governance Project.

2.      The project encountered delays in the implementation of a number of activities, as a
result of the longer time it took between the Board’s approval of the Credit (April 2010), putting
in place a fully functioning project unit (completed June 2011) and finally meeting disbursement
conditions for a sub-component (March 2012).

3.      The delay was going to affect the Government of Cape Verde (GoCV) ability to meet
commitments it entered into in order to source additional overseas assistance. GoCV therefore
utilized other financial resources to finance the cost of these delayed activities, thus freeing up
Credit resources. Failure to resolve these implementation delays in a timely manner would have
affected GoCV’s time-bound development program.

B.     PROJECT STATUS

4.       Overall implementation progress and progress towards achievement of PDOs are rated
moderately satisfactory. The current rating reflects delays in the early stages of implementation
after Credit effectiveness. The project has, however, made notable progress over the last year and
has now reached the following milestones: (i) the external auditor is signed and all audit
requirements complied with, and the Integrated Budget Management System (SIGOF) is largely
customized for the project; (ii) withdrawal and disbursement conditions have been met; (iii)
performance indicators defined, baselines set and targets determined; (iv) the project steering
committee is operational; and (v) disbursement stand at 38% as at October 2012, and is forecast
to rise significantly to 50% by end 2012.

5.      The following modifications to the project are proposed to ensure the continued
likelihood of achieving the project’s development objectives: (i) financing the cost of newly
agreed investment climate reforms on property registry and bankruptcy-these newly added
reforms are to complement the previously agreed ones which have been financed with other
government resources ; (ii) inclusion of a public agency- Business Development and Innovation
Agency (Portuguese acronym, ADEI), to oversee further strengthening of SME access to
incubation services; (iii) lowering the end-of-project target value of one of the key performance
indicators; and (iv) introduction of small civil works estimated to cost SDR 0.06 million to be
financed as part of activities under Category 1 in the Financing Agreement.

6.     This restructuring request does not involve (a) revisions to the PDOs; or (ii) closing date
extension; but does include (iii) a minor revision to the Results.



                                                1
7.     The project is expected to meet mid-term targets of some key performance indicators.
Additionally, the Matching Grant Facility (MGF) is now under implementation with at least forty
(40) SMEs having applied and met the selection criteria. Most other agreed activities (TA to
ARAP (the Regulatory Agency for Public Procurement), including legal support, public
procurement audits) are now in various stages of implementation.

C.     PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/Indicators

8.      The forecasted end of project target value for the key performance indicator “Increase the
number of SMEs that compete for contracts through the public procurement process? is being
revised downwards, from “80? to “30?. SMEs participation in public procurement activities is a
relatively new area and the original final target value is deemed to be very ambitious. This
change will require revisions to the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework in the Project
Operating Manual as noted in item 20, in Appendix to the Financing Agreement.

Schedule 1 of the Financing Agreement

       Part A: Enhancing SME Business Opportunities

                                         Component 1

9.     Supporting SME Investment Climate reforms. A program of actions to further carry
out SME investment climate reforms including: (i) scanning, indexing and digitizing of paper-
based archives of property registries; and (ii) development of information systems-software
development, deployment and hardware acquisition (US$0.54 million), will now be financed
with Credit proceeds. The above activities replace reforms of insolvency and property registry
regimes, and establishment of an electronic system to register property which the GoCV has
already financed with other non-Credit resources. Training of staff responsible for the
implementation of such reforms and members of the judiciary will continue to be supported.

10.     Improving SME Access to services. (a) Provision of support through and to the
Chambers of Commerce to coordinate assistance to SMEs which require certification services
but are unable to access assistance under the Matching Grants Program (US$0.24 million).

(b) Provision of support through and to ADEI, for the management of business development
services and deepening incubation under the on-going National Incubation Network program
including consultancy services, training, outreach and small civil works construction within the
premises of ADEI and the office of the Project Unit (US$0.283 million).

11.    Activities under 2(i) and 2(ii) will continue to be financed with Credit proceeds.

       Part B: Improving Government Capacity

                                                  Component 2

12.     Improving capacity for investment planning by selected public sector institutions: (a) the
Cape-Verdean Investment Promotion Agency (CI): In addition to carrying out studies and
provision of advice, the establishment of a functional “One-Stop-shop? in CI will also be
supported. (b) Directorate of Tourism (DGT) – Instead of studies and provision of advice,
support will now be provided for carrying out capacity building for staff of the DGT as well as
training and tourism promotion in collaboration with municipal governments, Chambers of
Commerce and other entities linked to tourism promotion. (US$0.350 million).

       Part C: Project Implementation

13.    In addition to existing agreed scope, limited civil works will be provided within the PIU’s
premises.

Schedule 2 of the Financing Agreement

14.    Financing. There is no reallocation of funds under the existing categories of expenditure,
however, unallocated funds under Category 1 may be utilized to fund the cost of civil works for
ADEI and the Project Unit (PU), not to exceed SDR 0.05 million and SDR 0.07 million for
operating costs. There are sufficient funds remaining in the Credit to fund all activities including
the newly introduced ones.
