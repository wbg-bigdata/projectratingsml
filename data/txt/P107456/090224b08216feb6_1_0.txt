                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the World Bank Board on April 29 2010 and declared effective November 30, 2010, however, implementation only started in June 2011 when the full
                         complement of the PIU staff was finally in place. Effectively almost a 1 year delay before project start. Since that time and through November 2013, 65% of the project funds have
                         been disbursed. During the period of delayed implementation noted above, Government funded some of the agreed activities with internally generated funds in order to not delay its

                         development agenda and time-sensitive commitments. The project has subsequently been restructured and new but aligned activities introduced. Some of the new activities are
                         currently under implementation and the project expects to disburse USD 1.00 Million in FY14.

                         The project is currently scheduled to close on July 31, 2014, however, in addition to the delay noted above, there are still some key activities which are yet to start or will require

                         additional time to complete. These key activities when completed will contribute to the likelihood of achieving and sustaining the project development objectives. The Ministry of
                         Finance will submit a request to restructure the project by December 15, 2013.

                         Enhancing SME Business Opportunities - Under the Supporting SME Investment Climate Reforms sub-component, agreed activities are about 95% complete. The provision of an
                         electronic platform to facilitate business registration, business licensing, and property registration has led to a reduction in the time and cost to enterprises and individuals in
                         undertaking these activities. The project also made provision to support the Insolvency regime through the drafting of a new Bankruptcy law, however, it is yet to start.
                         The Matching Grant Facility is being implemented by the Chambers of Commerce and seeks to enable SME beneficiaries to improve access to business training and business
                         services, including bookkeeping, business planning and management services, access to finance; so far eighty nine (89) enterprises have benefited and/or are benefiting under the
                         Facility. In addition to provision of capacity enhancement support to the Chambers of Commerce, groups of micro-enterprises which do not meet the criteria for the MGF, are being
                         assisted on skills and management development training. Support for certification of enterprises' operations is also being provided. SME beneficiaries have expressed their strong
                         appreciation for the facility given the positively significant outcomes it has brought to their businesses. They now request that the current ceiling be increased, even if that means a
                         revision of the cost-sharing ratio, as their business sophistication levels increase and they seek to gain improved access to external markets.

                         ADEI, which is the Government agency promoting SME development and innovation is implementing this sub-component through the setting up of a National Incubator Network,
                         rehabilitation of a facility to serve as premises and provision of office equipment. The Manager of the Network has been engaged, however, the remaining activities have been
                         delayed due to both internal and external constraints.

                         Improving Government Capacity - under this component, the project seeks to assist in the development and implementation of a program of actions aimed at strengthening the ability
                         of (i) the Cape Verde Investment Promotion Agency (CI), (ii) the Directorate of Tourism in the Ministry of Economy, Growth and Competitiveness; and (iii) the Ministry of Finance, to,
                         on their own formulate policies and to implement long-term planning that would facilitate private sector investments:

                         Findings from studies on CI’s institutional and organizational setting and modus operandi, including the development of a Strategic Plan and a Business Plan have identified non-
                         competitive practices compared to the best IPA practices. Technical Assistance to make CI competitive has resulted in (i) the design of a One-Stop Shop (OSS) on an electronic
                         platform; (ii) a review of the enabling legal framework to support their establishment of International Business Centers and Enterprises Internationalization, both export promotion
                         schemes. Additionally the design and operations of the OSS has been adapted to the new Investment Code. The OSS system when fully operational (expected by December 2013)
                         would ensure access to a web site that would handle inquiries on Tourism, Agribusiness, provide information to investors about opportunities, business enabling environment
                         procedures, On-line Marketing; One Stop shop for standards and quality services, registration and licensing of investment projects, electronic submission of all required
                         documentation, etc.

                          With the coming into operation of an electronic OSS, the study on the appraisal and follow-up of investment projects is no longer required. What is left to be implemented under this
                         sub-component is the development of an Operational Manual on IT and operational procedures, training of staff in the use of the OSS and on other key sectors and aligned areas.

                         These initiatives, which have ensured the first ever electronic OSS in Cape Verde, will help CI to substantially improve its institutional and operational performance. The legal
                         framework for export oriented investments has been streamlined and the procedures have been integrated into the OSS system. This is expected to contribute to improvements in the
                         business enabling environment through, among others, the reduction in government responses from a minimum of one year to a maximum of 50-60 days for investments considered
                         ‘high national interest’.

                                The activities to be implemented by the General Directorate of Tourism (DGT) continue to be seriously delayed and an agreement will need to be reached by mid-November to
                         restructure this sub-component and rather focus support on capacity building in the medium and longer terms for the agency’s staff as it continues to face apparent institutional
                         limitations. These limitations could seriously affect utilization of the government-mandated tourism levy, which has been in effect since May 1, 2013 (Euros 2.00/day/person-16+ years
                         for up to 10 days).

                         Recipient’s Ministries is being done on schedule. Progress has been satisfactory, with the Legal Framework on national procurement completed, the preparation of a Strategic Plan
                         and audits of the public procurement system ongoing. Creation of awareness on public procurement opportunities for private sector representatives needs to be expedited.

                         One activity remains to be implemented by DGPCP which has delayed and there's a need to quickly move it back on track.

                         Discussions have been concluded on a different method for assessing the impact of the Matching Grant Facility (MGF). The National Statistics Institute is to lead the collection and
                         collation of outcome indicators and assessment of the impact of the MGF, and it needs to expedite implementation of the agreed work plan.

                         Implementation Progress has picked up significantly and likelihood to achieve the PDOs significantly improved. However, given the delays in implementation at the time the project
                         was made effective, the project unit needed a solid amount of implementation progress to allow for a meaningful Mid-term Review to take place. A key meeting of all stakeholders
                         took place in September 2013, which was facilitated by an independent reviewer and recommendations to effect changes to the project has been shared with the IDA team, and will
                         form the basis for any discussions on any revisions to the project as currently designed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Cape Verde’s ranking on the 2014 Doing Business improved as a result of the complementary support provided under the project.

                         Cape Verde Investments will soon operationalize a One Stop Shop that would contribute to improved investment and export promotion.

                         ADEI and the Directorate of Tourism must improve their progress on implementation to enhance job creation opportunities for SMEs.

                         The project is scheduled to close on July 31, 2014 and unless an extension of the closing date is requested and granted, no new contracts will be approved after January 31, 2014.
