Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
The overall objective of the project is to improve the access of the poor in relatively disadvantaged communities to basic
social and economic infrastructure and services, largely by supporting small-scale projects, which are identified and
implemented with a high degree of community participation. Achieving this objective would contribute to the country's
poverty reduction goal. A Social Investment Fund (SIF) has been established to mobilize resources from the Bank, the
Government of Belize (GOB) and other donors for the project. The project would support GOB in: (i) establishing an
efficient, transparent, demand-driven participatory mechanism for financing basic services and infrastructure to targeted
groups; and (ii) channeling resources to community projects involving social assistance, baEic infrastructure and small-
scale productive activities.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Component                                 Category                       Cost ncl.             % of

sponsored by public or private organizations    *  Institution Building
able to design community projects to meet
SIF's established criteria. Community project
generation would be demand-driven, but
would be combined with promotional efforts
to develop institutional capacity as needed, to
target the poorest communities. Communities
would make a 5-10% cash or in-kind
contribution, depending on the type of
community projects.
MICROENTERPRISE CREDIT (no Bank                 *   Credit                                            1.20         10%

community-based microenterprises.

community groups would be sub-contracted to
a NGO or a financial intermediary with
demonstrated experience

3. Benefits and target population:
Overall expected project benefits include:
* Reaching beneficiaries in the poorest regions, with particular emphasis on Toledo, Cayo and Corozal;
* Increased access to basic social and economic infrastructure, social services and training; and
* Greater community involvement in poverty alleviation activities.

BELIZE                                                                                        Social Investment Fund Project
The project is expected to fund over 500 community projects that would provide poor communities with basic social and
economic infrastructure, access to social services and training. Given the demand-driven nature of the investments, it is
not possible to quantify ex-ante the number of community projects in each category, the number of beneficiaries or the
actual benefits to be delivered.
Expected benefits from individual community projects, given the menu (wee Annex 2 Detailed Project Description) of
community projects, include:
* for water and sanitation community projects, increased access to water, less incidence of disease and overall
improved health;
. for health community projects, increased access to health informnation, services and supplies, first-aid health care;
* for economic infrastructure, improved drainage, feeder roads and pedestrian bridges;
* for education community projects, increased access to primary education, improved quality of the learning
environment;
* for social services community projects, improved facilities and training for disadvantaged youth;
* for organizational strengthening community projects, improved capacity of NGOs, community-based organizations
(CBOs) and government agencies; and
* for microenterprise community projects (under Microenterprise Credit Component), improved access to credit and
thus, sources of income for the poor.
Beneficiaries and Poverty Targeting - Beneficiaries would include both the urban and rural poor, as well as poor
indigenous populations, and immigrants (including refugees). However, SIF's community project resource allocation
would be based on geographic poverty level and not ethnicity. See Annex 1-A for this project's indigenous peoples'
strategy.
Geographical Targeting Strategy - SIF's geographical targeting strategy has: (i) produced an index for estimating the
relative extent of poverty across districts and ranks districts and sub-district according to their respective levels of poverty;
(ii) developed tools for distributing resources geographically, deriving specific district and sub-district allocations; and
(iii) outlined a system for monitoring progress of poverty reduction efforts that incorporates a feedback mechanism for
adjusting the relative level of targeted resources across regions and community projects.
Targeting by type of community projects - The types of community projects eligible for SIF financing, by their nature,
tend to be oriented to the needs of the poor. Proposals for certain types of community projects, thought to meet the needs
of the poorest of the poor, would receive preference for financing by SIF.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period:
Four years (1997-2001).
Executing agencies:
*   SIF: legally established as an autonomous public statutory body in May 1996, would be responsible for overall project
coordination as well as the promotion, appraisal, financing and supervision of community projects;
*  District Community Development Officers (CDOs) of the Ministry of Human Resources (MHR): through a
Memorandum of Understanding with SIF, CDOs would assist SIF Field Officers (SFOs), and support promotion
activities, identification, environmental training, and social and institutional appraisals of community projects; and
*  Community projects would be sponsored by local governments, NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs)
and executed by qualified NGOs, CBOs and private sector contractors.
Project coordination:
Many of SIF's activities will complement those of other government agencies. For each type of community project, SIF
would form a framework agreement (i.e. a memorandum of understanding) with the corresponding agency to ensure the
consistency of SIF financing with broad sectoral policy as well as to avoid duplication in financing. Furthermore, the

BELIZE                                                                              Social Investment Fund Project
agency's endorsement would be required before a community project is presented to the SIF Board to ensure the
availability of recurrent costs (personnel, supplies and maintenance) implied by community projects.
The Operational Manual comprises several guides which set out in detail arrangements for project implementation,
including: the overall SIF Guide (i.e. Main Guide), the Administrative and Financial Guide, Appraisal Guide and
Supervision Guide for each type of community project, Unit Cost Database, the Guide for presenting projects to SIF, the
Social and Institutional Appraisal Guide, Environmental Guide, Procurement Guide and the MIS Guide. The Operational
Manual was appraised by the Bank and found satisfactory.
Project oversight:
The Board of Directors, comprising nine members from the public, NGO and private sectors would: (i) approve and adopt
policies and procedures governing SIF operations; (ii) appoint an Executive Director; (iii) supervise the overall operation
of the Fund; and (iv) approve, or delegate the approval of, community projects for SIF financing. Board members are
appointed by the Minister of Economic Development.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
SIF would submit to the Bank financial reports at the end of each semester. External audit reports, prepared by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, would be submitted annually in accordance with Bank standards. The
project's chart of accounts, which was developed with the assistance of a Bank expert, was reviewed during the appraisal
and found acceptable.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
Along with the financial reports, SIF would submit to the Bank indicators for monitoring and evaluation (see Annex 1)
semiannually. SIF and the Bank would jointly conduct annual reviews and a Mid-Term Review of SIF by February 2000
to evaluate the progress in project implementation, to make necessary adjustments and to review the management of SIF.
At that stage, the optimal duration of SIF would be determined. Other donors would be invited to participate in the review
as appropriate.
Monitoring and evaluation of project benefits would be conducted through a set of studies, including: (a) ongoing external
supervision of the technical quality of community projects; (b) Beneficiary Assessments/Ex-post evaluations (questions
designed to specifically address cultural appropriateness of community projects would be incorporated into the surveys);
and (c) benefits assessments (which look at whether or not the qualitative and quantitative benefits anticipated at the time
of appraisal have materialized). Results from the first two evaluations would be available by the mid-term review.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Belize's population (about 220,000) comprises five major ethnic/language groups (see Annex 1-A: Indigenous Peoples'
Strategy). The small size of the country combined with a high degree of ethnic diversity presents a unique challenge for
designing effective poverty reduction programs.
The level of poverty in Belize is estimated at 35% of the total population with the highest incidence in rural areas, at 40%,
as compared to 26% in urban areas. The largest numbers are located in Belize City, Cayo rural and Toledo rural. The
more easily identifiable groups below the poverty line are: the young and young-adult unemployed or underemployed,
young drop-outs with low levels of education, women with more than three children and no education, workers in the
banana and citrus plantations and small farmers, including Indigenous communities. The social problems presented by a
large group of youngsters out of school, unemployed and often facing the pressures of a breakdown of family structures
are of immediate concern to the Government. Street crime, gang violence, drug abuse and trafficking are widespread and
on the rise. There is a high imbalance in coverage of social services between rural and urban areas, especially health
services, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. Despite gains over the last 20 years in reducing infant mortality rates
(IMR) and lessening the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, marked geographical and socioeconomic differentials in
health remain. While the overall mortality of children currently stands at 35 deaths per 1,000 live births, in rural areas, it
reaches 54. Additionally, children in rural areas are at higher risk of diarrheal diseases and malnutrition. Incidence of
malaria and dengue is also on the rise in rural areas.
The GOB's National Development Strategy 1996-2000 seeks to promote human development and reduce poverty, and
identifies the following six components of the social sector strategy: (i) delivery of education and generation of
knowledge; (iv) improvement in the delivery of health service and the general health of the Belizian people; (iii) tangible
poverty reduction activities; (iv) community and advocacy skills development; (v) improvement in the quality and
distribution of ownership of the housing stock; and (vi) prevention and control of crime. The main challenge for GOB
would be to implement its social sector strategy while undergoing fiscal adjustment. GOB's fiscal position has been
exacerbated by ambitious capital spending in the early 1 990s, and the overall public sector deficit expanded substantially,
reaching an average of 8 percent of GDP during the period 1991-93. While GOB has introduced a serious of restrictive
measures in recent years, fiscal adjustment continues to be one of the most critical tasks (see "Belize: Fiscal Policies for
Stabilization and Growth - Public Expenditure Review"; May 30, 1996; Report No. 1 5337-BEL).
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The National Development Strategy 1996-2000 specifically identifies SIF as one of the instruments for implementing
tangible poverty reduction activities, or Component (iii) of the overall social sector strategy (see Section 6 above). The
identified priority actions include the following:
*  Provision of potable water supplies to the rural communities;
*  Provision of health education services to the poor;
*  Rehabilitation/construction of health posts;
*  Distribution of training materials for community health workers;
*  Improvement of the feeder road systems, including drainage and small pedestrian bridges;
*  Promotion of the use of Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrines where flushable sewage disposal systems are not
practical;
*  Provision of community training in the management of solid waste; and
*  Provision of credit and training for microenterprises.

BELIZE                                                                              Social Investment Fund Project
SIF would also contribute to community and advocacy skills development, or Component (iv) of the social sector strategy,
through the promotion of community participation.
Other components of the social sector strategy are being implemented with the support of the Bank and other donors (see
Section 9 below).
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Separate stand-alone projects in water and sanitation, education, health, infrastructure, industry.
This was rejected due to:
*  The existence of major ongoing and planned projects in the related sectors (see Section 9 below);
*  Difficulties in coordinating projects managed by separate line ministries;
*  High administrative overhead in administering several projects separately;
. Difficulties in reaching poor communities through traditional supply-driven investment projects

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The project design fully incorporates the following lessons learnt from the Bank's experience in financing SIFs in LAC as
well as other regions, and from the Bank's previous operations in Belize.
Critical success factors for SIF:
(i)    Well-paid, qualified staff, with a director with proven managerial experience;
(ii)   Political and institutional autonomy;
(iii)  Targeting mechanisms to ensure poorest groups are reached;
(iv)   Promotion and support for community based projects generation;
(v)   Technically simple community project designs;
(vi)   Strong local participation during all stages of the community project cycle;
(vii)  Well-defined appraisal criteria and transparent appraisal procedures;
(viii) Execution of community projects by private contractors, NGOs and communities;
(ix)  Regular and frequent financial and operational audits;
(x)   Rigorous community project supervision;
(xi)   Collaboration with line ministries to ensure complementary objectives; and
(xii)  Political support and commitment to the goals and integrity of the Fund.
Critical success factors for operations in Belize:
(i)    Sufficient project preparation time, especially for projects requiring policy decisions;
(ii)   Substantial technical assistance to supplement limited administrative and technical manpower available for
project implementation;
(iii)  Community participation through information sharing and close collaboration to promote "ownership" and
ensure sustainability;
(iv)  Adequate GOB counterpart funding and recurrent budgetary support for key programs after project
completion.

Analysis:
The SIF is the first of its kind in Belize, assisting community level investment initiatives in multiple sectors, including
education, health, water & sanitation, infrastructure and industry. The most likely alternative would be separate stand-
alone projects in those sectors (see Section 8). This would be less cost-effective than the proposed project. Under this
alternative scenario, the administrative overhead to manage and coordinate the same level and scope of activities would be
higher by $1 .1 million. Annex 4 compares the project with its alternative.
...................................... ....................    ........................................................................................................................................................................ ............... .......................I................
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)
Given the current menu of community projects to be financed by SIF, it is expected that with the project, government
expenditures would rise only marginally, about 0.06% of GNP during the implementation period, and less than 0.02%
during the operational period. For community projects that entail an increase in the GOB's expenditures on recurrent
costs, prior to community project approval, the applicable line agency's endorsement would be required. Community
project beneficiaries would contribute 5-10% of the total cost of each community project, depending on the type of
project. Where relevant, cost recovery mechanisms for different types of community projects would be established.
................................................................................................................... ...................................................................................................................................................................................
15. Technical Assessment:
Technical standards have been developed for each community project type based on existing norms available from the
respective public agencies to ensure sectoral coherence and compatibility. These norms have been incorporated into SIF's
appraisal guides. The technical appraisal of community projects would confirm that infrastructure, equipment and other
inputs are consistent in scale, quality and content with the norms established and that implementation is technically
feasible. In addition, SIF would maintain qualified technical staff as agreed to by the Bank.
..................... ....................   ...........................................................................    ........................I........................................I................................................  .................................................
16. Institutional Assessment:
As summarized below, the level of existing institutional capacity is acceptable for project implementation. However,
ample technical assistance and close supervision would be needed to further strengthen the capacity, especially during the
initial phase of implementation.
a. Executing agencies:
As mentioned above, community projects would be sponsored by local governments, NGOs and community-based
organizations (CBOs) and executed by qualified NGOs, CBOs and private sector contractors. Community-based
organizations may be eligible for the reimbursement of the preparation cost incurred for necessary technical assistance
during community project preparation depending on the type of projects. Eligible technical assistance related expenses
would be reimbursed only if the proposed community projects are approved by SIF, thus providing an incentive for
producing well-prepared community projects. The Bank's experience with this type of arrangement indicates that it
would lead to better prepared community projects and thus to a decrease in time that SIF staff must dedicate to
reformulate community projects.
During the community project appraisal process, SIF would conduct an institutional analysis of community project
sponsoring and/or executing agencies to assess the capacity of the entity or identify training needs in order to ensure
successful implementation and sustainability of community projects.
Local Governments - Despite its centralized government budget control and culture of dependency, Belize has an
extensive structure of decentralized institutions at the district level: first, the presence of key government ministries such
as health, education, human resources and; second, "representative" community level institutions. In towns, Town

BELIZE                                                                                        Social Investment Fund Project
Boards are representative bodies with certain functions and an associated budget. In rural areas, elected Village Councils,
although not as yet with legal status or budget, are important social institutions with a number of defined functions. Both
were initiated, developed and controlled by government, and have had cyclical periods of activity and decline relating to
political and economic factors. SIF will work closely with local government institutions and build on the existing social
capital. In rural areas, it would take advantage of the experience of Village Councils in petitioning the government for
infrastructure community projects and in organizing community labor.
The NGO sector - Although currently the sector comprises in excess of 1 00 organizations (formal and informal) serving
a wide spectrum of social and economic needs, for the most part, the financial basis of these institutions is weak and
highly dependent on external finance, which has decreased in recent years. Support from the Government has also
diminished due to the needs to reduce public expenditure, and has led to the decline of services provided by NGOs.
However, despite current operational and financial constraints, the NGO sector still offers SIF a mechanism for reaching
out to poor community groups through its network of programs, personnel and local contacts that reach into poor
communities.
Community Based Organizations - The growth of CBOs, such as cooperatives, community action groups etc. in Belize
in recent years has been encouraging in both urban and rural areas. In rural areas, Village Councils are also considered to
be CBOs although historically, they were developed by government. CBOs have been useful in sustaining local
involvement in the development of communities, and as a way of ensuring greater control over resources and decision-
making. However, CBOs often have limited capacity and high dependence on voluntary effort and consequent loss of
consistency in management and operations.! Given that CBOs would be the main bodies that would represent SIF's
beneficiaries, SIF has been designed with a strong institutional capacity development component, to help strengthen their
participation and capacity in all stages of the community project cycle, and provide them with training in community
project operations and management where necessary. Thus, an identified training component would be integrated into
many community project types.
b. Project management:
Monitoring and coordination of project activities to be carried out by many executing entities requires experienced
individuals with proven management skills. The Government has agreed to recruit staffs who meet these requirements.
Periodic reports, such as semiannual financial reports, performance indicators, annual institutional reports and external
audit reports and assessments conducted during supervision missions would help indicate the effectiveness of project
management.
.......... ......................................... ...............................................I........................................................  .................................................................................  ........................................ ..............
17. Social Assessment:
Adequate measures have been taken, and incorporated in the project design as summarized below.
Community Groups: Community level formal and informal consultations were conducted by SIF during field visits to
both rural and urban areas, some of which took place during the Bank's missions, Information, concerns and ideas
gathered during the discussions held were incorporated into the design of the SIF community project cycle and in the
menu of community projects offered by SIF. Among other concerns, two seasonal constraints to community participation
in the project cycle (including implementation), were identified: availability of local labor and weather conditions. Also,
training and institutional development were identified as priority needs. Information from community surveys carried out
in conjunction with the National Poverty Assessment (1995) and the National Development Plan (1994) was also taken
into consideration.

Indigenous Groups: In the above referenced meetings, given the multiethnic composition of Belize, particular attention
was given to ensuring that meetings covered all five different ethnic groups. Where appropriate, separate meetings were
held with women's groups. In addition, the SIF Preparation Team held meetings with several indigenous organizations
including the Garifuna Council and the Toledo Maya Cultural Council. Furthermore, SIF office has employed multi-
lingual staff, capable of assisting communities in all major languages. SIF's indigenous peoples' strategies are
summarized in Annex 1-A.
Women: CDOs and SFOs would ensure women's participation throughout the community project cycle, particularly
among certain indigenous groups.
Needs Assessment Mini-Guide: The Operational Manual includes the Needs Assessment Mini-Guide that has been
prepared by the Bank's anthropologist, and incorporates techniques in line with participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and
rapid rural appraisal (RRA) to adequately address concerns regarding communities and indigenous groups.
18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category         F   A    E   B.          C
Because of their small size and characteristics as described in the Menu of Community Projects (see Annex 2), no
community project financed by SIF is expected to generate significant negative environmental effects. Therefore,
environmental guidelines would be prepared only for the types of community projects that may generate some degree of
impact, mainly those under water & sanitation and health in the present menu of projects. Environmental guidelines
would specify the following:
*  Environmental criteria for preparing, appraising and supervising community projects;
*  Appropriate mitigation measures to be incorporated into SIF's community project cycle and procedures for
conducting a environmental assessment;
*  Key environmental concerns/information to be dealt with would be included in operations and maintenance
training;
*  Performance indicators to monitor compliance with environmental guidelines at all stages of the community
projects cycle.
The draft Operational Manual including the environmental guidelines was submitted to the Bank prior to negotiations.
SIF's adoption of the Operational Manual acceptable to the Bank is a condition of effectiveness.
Strategies to address the issues pertaining to indigenous populations is described in Section 17: Social Assessment (above)
and Annex l-A, Indigenous Peoples' Strategy.

20. Sustainability:
Sustainability of community projects would be ensured through:
* High degree of participation in community project identification, preparation, appraisal, contracting and supervision.
* Ownership by the beneficiaries, as evidenced through 5-10% community group cash or in-kind contributions.
* Appraisal criteria that require presentation of an operation and maintenance plan.
* Coordinating agreements with government agencies to assure coverage of recurrent costs for those community
projects that generate such costs.
* Carrying out of a social analysis to assess the degree of participation by the beneficiaries in the preparation of the
proposed community project.
*  Execution of an institutional evaluation of the capacity of sponsoring agencies to sustain services after SIF financing
ends or of implementing agencies in cases where NGOs or community groups propose to implement projects.

Regarding the sustainability of SIF as an institution, it was agreed that, based on evaluation of the efficiency and impact of
SIF and within the context of the GOB's evolving social sector policy and strategy, this would be looked at during the
Mid-term Review, planned for February 2000.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
* Targeting of Indigenous Populations: Because indigenous populations constitute a large percentage of the poor,
SIF's geographic and menu-based targeting strategy is de-facto biased towards the indigenous populations. However,
the project does not explicitly target an indigenous population or any particular ethnic group. Attempting to do so in
the small multi-ethnic society of only 220,000 people divided into five major ethnic groups would be difficult. The
debate concerning indigenous populations is likely to continue.
*  Political Influence on SIF Operations: Under the existing fiscal constraints, politicians tend to see SIF as an
alternative tool to respond to their constituencies. Although SIF instruments are established in a very clear and
transparent manner, it is also possible that some politicians may attempt to exercise their influence on SIF operations.

Annex 1-A: Indigenous Peoples' Strategy
Ethnic Profile of Belize
Belize presents a unique situation regarding ethnic issues. For a country of a very small population, it is highly
ethnically diverse, comprising five major ethnic groups as well as smaller sub-groups. Under conventional definitions,
only Maya (including two sub-groups called Mopan and Ketchi) would be considered as an indigenous group. However,
practically all the ethnic groups consider themselves as indigenous ethnic minorities.
Belize is generally considered English speaking, and indeed English is the official language of the country. On
the other hand, it is practically no one's native language. Like other countries in the Caribbean, those who are considered
as English speakers often happen to speak Creole at home and in non-official situations. In fact, there is a citizen's
movement in support of providing education in Creole, like in the cases of other major languages including Spanish,
Mopan and Ketchi.
Another critical dimension is the existence of immigrants who have left their home countries in Central America
for political and economic reasons. They are about 11.7% of total population in Belize, and 40.5% of the immigrants
(representing about 13.8% of the poor in the country) are estimated to be under the poverty line. Ethnically, most
consider themselves as Mestizos, and a small minority would be considered as Mayans.

Indigenous Peoples Strategy
General Principle. Because of its ethnic diversity among its very small population, the Government has been exercising a
considerable care with respect to the handling of indigenous populations. In fact, all ethnic groups consider themselves as
indigenous; therefore, indigenous strategy must include all ethnic groups. Because of the sensitivity involved, providing
preferential treatment to a particular ethnic group - indigenous (as defined by the donors) or not - would be politically
unacceptable.
Legal and land tenure issues are not within the scope of this project.

Targeting Strategy. SIF employs a two-fold targeting strategy: geographic and menu-based. First, SIF would earmark
resources geographically to each district, based on the poverty index produced using economic and social indicators. The
following table shows proposed relative resource allocations to each district in Belize. The least populated Toledo
district, where the presence of Mayan and Ketchi populations is the highest, would receive the largest share of resources.
Second, SIF's menu of eligible project (see Annex I) includes types of projects in which only the poor would be
interested, in terms of range of options, choice of technology and size of project (i.e. US$250,000 / project cap).
Incidentally, a majority of indigenous (as defined by non-Belizians) populations would be part of SIF's target population
under this geographic targeting because of their level of poverty under this two-fold targeting strategy.
District      Relative

District    Total Population     (%/6)         Capita
Toledo                  18,725           26.4         1.000

Total                 216,500           100.0
SIF Staff Composition. Terms of Reference of SIF staff favor multi-lingual candidates over monolingual candidates. SIF
has already employed several multi-lingual staff, and is capable of answering the need of all major language groups in
Belize. Furthermore, Community Development Officers (CDOs), who are employed by the Ministry of Human
Resources and reside in districts, would be an integral part of SIF operations. CDOs maintain close ties with all local
ethnic groups, and their knowledge and role would be particularly critical in answering to the need of remote
communities. Furthermore, all SIF staff and CDOs would receive training in handling ethnic and gender concerns.
Communications Strategy. English and Spanish are the most widely used languages in Belize. Except among the
immigrant population, most Mestizos are literate in English. Other languages, including Creole, Mopan and Ketchi are
typically spoken but not written languages. Therefore, production of written promotional materials (brochures, posters,
etc.) would be carried out first in English, and then in Spanish.
Radio will be used to promote SIF on a national basis as well as in remote communities. Radio spots will be aired on
Belizean stations that feature programs in English, Spanish, Mopan and Ketchi. In addition, audiotapes will be produced
for dissemination to some communities along with tape players. These tapes can also be played in transportation vehicles
such as minibuses. Audiotapes can be produced at a low cost in a number of different languages and can be left in
communities where the effectiveness of written materials may be limited.
SIF would also organize information programs for NGOs through workshops inviting representatives from a variety of
NGOs to explain the objectives of the Fund, and to discuss opportunities for collaborations at various stages of the project
cycle. As many NGOs in Belize work closely with indigenous communities, collaborations with these NGOs will help
SIF better address the needs of indigenous communities.
Community Needs Assessment. To ensure that community projects properly incorporate ethnic and gender concerns, SIF
project cycle begins with needs assessment undertaken by CDOs, SFOs or NGOs to assist communities in identifying and
prioritizing their needs. This would also ensure "informed participation" of indigenous groups. Furthermore, training in
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) would be made available to CDOs as well as interested NGOs, and village / town
chairpersons as appropriate. Needs assessment comprises two components: (a) community profile, including
identification of ethnic composition of the village / town, stored in SIF's MIS; and (b) participatory consultation using
PRA techniques, focus group meetings, ranking and listing to ensure that subgroups are included in the consultation
process. Community profiling would supplement existing data on indigenous groups from the 1991 Census in the more
recent National Poverty Assessment (1995).

Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Community Projects: US$ 7.87 million (total cost of component)
Community projects would be sponsored by public, private or voluntary organizations and would be financed on a
grant-basis. Community project generation would be demand-driven, but would be combined with promotional
efforts to develop institutional capacity as needed, so as to target the poorest communities. Communities would
make a 5-10% cash or in-kind contribution to community projects.
Community projects are expected to average US$20,000 with an execution period limited to one year or less. No
community projects would exceed US$250,000.

Annex 4
BELIZE: Social Investment Fund Project
Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
Belize: SIF is the first of its kind in Belize, assisting community level investment initiatives in multiple sectors,
including education, health, water & sanitation, infrastructure and industry. The most likely alternative would be separate
stand-alone projects in those sectors.
Summary and Main Assumptions
Because of GOB's fiscal constraints, a combined total of alternative stand-alone projects would be similar to the
size of the proposed project (US$11.7 million). Consequently, each stand-alone project would be less than $2.4 million
(assuming five separate projects) a project. However, the administrative overhead would not be reduced proportionally,
because each project would still have to respond to the need of six major ethnic groups in six remote districts, and hire
technical specialists, financial manager, lawyer, etc. At present, the total staff composition of SIF is about 25 (including
support staff, clerical staff and a driver), and the administrative overhead is about $1.8 million or 15% of the total project
cost. If each stand alone project required a total of eight staff (a very conservative estimate) and basic facilities in order to
obtain the level of community responsiveness similar to the proposed project, the administrative overhead would increase
to $2.8 million or 24%, reducing the amount of resources available to comnmunity projects by $1.1 million. Table A4.1
shows a comparison between the proposed scenario and the alternative scenario.

Additional Cost-effectiveness indicators
Further analysis is handicapped by the project's demand-driven and pilot nature. Furthermore, due to the lack of
prior experience in similar operations in the country, unit costs (see Table A4.2 below) under SIF financed community
projects have been estimated using corresponding figures used by applicable line ministries and externally financed
projects. Consequently, further cost comparison would not be a very meaningful exercise. However, these figures will be

BELIZE: Social Investment Fund Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement Arrangements
SIF would be centrally managing all procurement actions under the Project. Proposed procurement arrangements are
summarized in Table A.
Civil Works contracts cost US$ 100,000 or more6 will be awarded following National Competitive Bidding Procedures
(NCB), which must not discriminate against overseas bidders and are acceptable to the Bank. Smaller works, estimated to
cost less than US$100,000, would be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations
obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation up to an aggregate contract value of US$1.3
million.
Goods would be procured using Limited International Bidding (LIB) among manufacturers with established service
facilities in Belize or neighboring countries. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000 but US$25,000 or more
would be procured in accordance with the NCB procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$0.9 million. For smaller
purchases, National Shopping procedures may be used up to an aggregate amount of US$0.7 million for contracts valued
at less than US$25,000.
Consultants' Services will be contracted in accordance with the provisions of the Guideline for the Use of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency, dated August 1981.
Prior Review. Prior Bank review would be required before bids are invited, and before final decisions on contract awards
are made for the following procurement actions: (a) LIB procurement; (b) the first two NCB procurement in each of civil
works and goods; (c) all consultants' services estimated to cost US$50,000 or more if provided by a firm, and US$15,000
or more if provided by an individual; (d) all consultants' services contracted using the direct contracting (single-source)
procedure; (e) any amendment of contracts resulting in the increase of the contract value beyond the review limits set in
(a) through (c) above; and (f) assignment of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank. Random ex-post
review of all other contracts will be carried out by Bank supervision missions. Table B. summarizes applicable
procurement procedures and review requirements.
Disbursement
Required Documentation. Disbursement against the following expenditures would require the submission of complete
documentation: (a) all expenditures LIB procurement; (b) the first two expenditure requiring NCB procurement in each of
civil works and goods; (c) all consultants' services contracts valued at US$50,000 or more if performed by a firm, and at
US$15,000 or more if performed by an individual. Disbursement against expenditures other than those specified in (a)
through (c) in the above, and those against activities not undertaken by contracts will be made on the basis of Statement of
Expenditures (SOE). Documentation would be retained by SIF and would be made available for Bank staff review and
the auditors. Applicable documentation requirements by contract value are summarized in Table B.
Disbursement Percentages. Disbursement percentages of Bank loan against eligible expenditures would be: (a) under
the Community Projects Component, for consultant services and training, 100%; for goods, 100% of foreign expenditures,
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 85% of local expenditures for other items procured locally; for works,
6 Because of the limit in the size of a community project, no contract would exceed US$250,000.



85%; (b) under the SIF Institutional Support Component, for consultant services, 85% of local expenditures, and 100% of
foreign expenditures; (e) for operating expenditures, 90% for salaries of SIF's support staff, and 00% for other
incremental operating cost. No expenditure under the Microenterprise credit component would be eligible for Bank
disbursement. The proposed allocation of loan proceeds by disbursement category is presented in Table C.
Special Account
In order to facilitate disbursements, a special account in an amount of $600,000 will be opened in the Central Bank of
Belize, to be operated by SIF under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank would make an initial
deposit of US$300,000 in the Special Account. Once total withdrawals from the loan have reached US$2.0 million, the
authorized allocation for the Special Account would be increased to US$600,000. SIF will submit replenishment
applications for the Special Account on a monthly basis, or when 20% the authorized allocation has been used, whichever
occurs first. The replenishment applications will be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of the
Special Account and a reconciliation bank statement of the Special Account against the Bank's records. Replenishment of
the Special Account would follow Bank procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to the Bank for review and approval within six
months of the end of each fiscal year.
