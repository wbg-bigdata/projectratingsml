INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO ThE YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOR A WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed devel-
opment credit to the Yemen Arab Republic for an equivalent of US$6.25 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a water supply project. A portion of the
IDA Credit ($3.5 million) would be relent to the National Water and Sewerage
Authority for 25 years, including five years of grace, with interest of 7.25
percent per annum and the balance would be made available as a Government
capital contribution.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Yemen is dealt with in paragraphs 2 - 14 of the
President's Report of the same date on a proposed development credit to the
Yemen Arab Republic for an industrial estate project (Report No. P-1351a-YAR).
A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YEMEN
3.        The proposed project would be the Bank Group's fifth lending operation
in Yemen, including the proposed industrial estate project. For a review of
Bank Group activities in Yemen, reference should be made to paragraph 15-20 of
the President's Report of the same date on the proposed industrial estate
project. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and IBRD grants
as of December 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of on-going projects. IFC
has not had any operations in Yemen so far.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
4.        Yemen's water supply sector is almost completely undeveloped.
Sana'a may be the last world capital without a public water supply system.
The principal port city of Hodeida also has no city-wide piped water facil-
ities. There is a modest water supply system only in Taiz, Yemen's third
city and the diplomatic capital during the civil war. The country has no
public sewerage facilities.
5.        Yemen relies solely on groundwater for its water supply.    There are
no permanent sources of surface water of any significance. The major wadis



- 2 -
(river beds) may have heavy flows during the summer rains, but none usually
contain running water year round. There are springs in and around Sana'a and
Taiz, but they do not yield sufficient water to supply these cities. In most
areas the groundwater is moderately mineralized, In the highlands the alka-
linity and the hardnesss are fairly high, while in the coastal zone the salt
content is high.
6.        Presently most of the people in the YAR obtain their water supplies
from shallow wells and water vendors. In the main urban centers limited piped
water supply is provided by local cooperative organizations and private enter-
prises. The villages and rural areas depend primarily on hand dug wells. The
existing water supply facilities are inadequate, water shortages are widespread
and most wells, particularly hand dug wells, are contaminated. Continual low-
ering of the water tables, due to limited recharge and increasing extraction
for both agriculture and domestic uses, is being experienced by many commu-
nities particularly in the Sana'a area.
7.        Hydrological studies have been undertaken for the main cities of
Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeida and potential groundwater sources to meet their long
term requirements have been located. There is very limited hydrological data
available for the rest of the country. However, recent country-wide drilling
experiences indicate that water supplies for most of the rural communities
can be assured by deep boreholes reaching the underlaying cretaceous sand
stone some 200-300 m below.
8.        The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) was until recently responsible
for planning and executing all government projects in the sector. It has two
main sections - Municipal and Rural Affairs and Rural Water Supply. The
latter section was established in 1972 and is responsible for all rural water
supply development and for coordinating external assistance for such projects.
9.        MPW is not adequately staffed or financed to enable it to play an
effective role in the sector. The Ministry has only two qualified water en-
gineers responsible for both urban and rural water supply schemes and there
are no trained managerial or finance personnel. As a result, sector work at
the national level lacks direction and thie roles of agencies active in the
sector are not coordinated.
10.       In the main centers, the piped water supply systems are operated
by local authorities and private enterprises, The Taiz Cooperative Organiza-
tion operates the Kennedy Memorial Water Supply System, which was built in
1964/65 and was the city's first piped water supply project.    The Port
Authority of Hodeida operates a water supply system which was originally in-
tended to serve the needs of the harborD but has since been extended to serve
public standpipes as well as some buildings and households.
11.       The main obstacles to sector development have been shortages of
manpower and finance, institutional weaknesses, lack of a national policy for
the sector and inadequate data on needs and resources. To provide for devel-
opment in the main urban centers, the Government has established the National
Water and Sewerage Authority (para 20). Rural water supplies will continue



3 -
to be organized separately within the NOW.   A sizeable rural water development
program is already under way with assistance from WhO, UNICEF and bilateral
agencies.
12.       An IBRD/WHO sector mission in September 1972 proposed a tentative
progran of investment which calls for an estimated $47 million expenditure
in the next 5 to 10 years, $32 million for the three main urban centers and
$15 million for ruiral areas. Because of severe Government budget constraints,
progress on implementing this program will depend on the support given by
external agencies. The most likely sources of assistance apart from the As-
sociation, are expected to be the United States (for Taiz and rural areas),
the People's Republic of China, Iraq and Abu Dhabi (rural water supplies).
A rural integrated development project, scheduled for appraisal by the Asso-
ciation in early 1974, will provide water to villages in the southern high-
lands region,
Sana'a Water Supply
13.       The most critical water supply situation exists in Sana'a.     The
city derives its supply from wells sunk into the shallow aquifer underlying
the Sana'a plain. The recharge capacity of the aquifer (about 3 million m3
per year) is about half the current extraction rate, resulting in a steady
drop in the water table of about 3 m per year. As a result, the frequency
of wells drying up has increased markedly in recent years and the city has
been experiencing acute water shortages, Sana'a has no public sewerage sys-
tem; the wastewater is dispersed in the ground and percolates to the aquifer
from which drinking water is abstracted. Bacteriological analysis of the
water has shown a high level of pollution in most wells and all taps.
14.       Sana'a's residents obtain their water supplies from small distribu-
tion networks, private wells and water vendors. The principal supply is op-
erated by the Sana'a Development Board 1/. This network supplies intermittently
about 2,000 households, mosques and a few public taps. Houses have water for
only 15 minutes to 2 hours per day depending on location. Private distribu-
tion systems supply a limited number of buildings and water is available for
brief periods. About 45 percent of the population depend on water vendors
and public taps.
15.       Domestic water consumption is very low, ranging from about 9 litres
per capita per day (lpcd) to about 33 lpcd. This is attributed to the lack
of supply and the high cost of water. Residents of Sana'a pay an extra-
ordinarily high price for water in proportion to their income. Even in ab-
solute terms, the average cost of water is among the highest in the world.
Householders pay about $16 per 1000 gallons of water when delivered by
vendors. The capital cost of a private well is about $1330 equivalent and
annual operating costs average about $110.
1/    The Sana'a Development board is also responsible for streets, sanita-
tion, parks and other municipal functions in Sana'a.

PART IV - niE PROJECT
16.       The proposed project will provide Sana'a with its first adequate
public water supply system. It will also help create a competent national
organization to administer the country's water and sewerage systems. A
credit and project summary is attached as Annex III together with a map of
Sana'a showing the proposed project works. A report entitled "Appraisal of
the Sana'a Water Supply Project" (287a-YAR) dated January 14, 1974 is being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.       The project is based on feasibility studies financed by the UNDP and
prepared by consultants with WHO as Executing Agency. It was appraised in
June 1973. Negotiations were held in December, 1973. The Yemen delegation was
led by Dr. Abdul Karim El-Eryani, Chairman of the Central Planning Organization.
Mr. Mohammed Gubari, Director General of the National Water and Sewerage Author-
ity (NWSA) also participated in the negotiations.
18.       The proposed project would provide:    (a) a well-field and associated
works about 5 km north of Sana'a; (b) headworks and chlorination facilities;
(c) a distribution system; (d) essential equipment for operation and mainte-
nance of the system; (e) training for technical, financial and management
staff; (f) engineering consultants to supervise construction; (g) technical
assistance to help establish and operate NWSA during its initial years; and
(h) consultant's services for supervision of construction of project works
and preparation of final engineering of tale Hodeida water supply system. A
more complete description of project works is given in Annex III.
19.       The population of Sana'a is estimated to be about 80,000-100,000
and growing at a rate of about 6.5 percent per year. The proposed project
would provide a piped water system to the area of Sana'a expected to be
densely urbanized by 1976. This would require a network of about 17 km of
water mains, 175 km of distribution lines and about 6000 house connections.
The project is the first phase of a 10-year program of works -- prepared
under the UNDP/WHO project -- to meet the citv's water requirements by 1985.
Organization and Mana&ement
20.       To carry out the project, and eventually assume responsibility for
the development of water and sewerage in thie urban centers of the YAR, the
Government has created the National W4ater antd Sewerage Authority.  The Director
General has already been appointed,   As tl;e Authoritv will not have sufficient
qualified staff initially to achminister the project, engineering and management
consultants will be provided under the project to supervise construction and
help operate the water supply svstem. A major training progra-m will be under-
taken to develop local operating, management and financial personnel (para 28).
21.       The NWSA will assume authority for the operation of the Sana'a
Development Board water system as soon as possible to gain operating exper-
ience prior to commencement of service of the Sana'a public system in 1975.
It would also be responsible for supervising the preparation of UNDP-financed



feasibility studies for the Hodeida water supply system and for waste water
disposal in Sana'a and Hodeida. Eventually NWJSA would operate these systems
and assume authority for developing and operating all urban water supply
systems.
Project Cost and Financial Results
22.       The estimated cost of the project is $6.84 million, with a foreign
exchange component of $5.23 million. The proposed IDA Credit of $6.25 million
would finance the full foreign exchange component, and $1.02 million of local
costs. The balance of $0.59 million and $0.51 million in working capital
would be provided by the Government and through internal cash generation.
23.       The proceeds of the IDA Credit would be passed on to the NWSA in
two ways: $3.50 million would be on-lent by the Government at an annual in-
terest rate of 7-1/4 percent for a period of twenty-five years, and the bal-
ance of $2.75 million would form part of the Government's contribution to
NWSA's equity. This capitalization structure will help ensure the financial
viability of the newly established authority, burdened with the creation of an
entire water supply system in Sana'a and responsible for project preparation
activity in Sana'a and Hodeida.
24.       Even with such a capitalization, the average water rates proposed
for the Sana'a system would be among the highest in the Middle East (although
considerably lower than the present average cost of water in Sana'a). A
charge of YR 1.2 per m3 ($1.01 per 1000 gal) and a connection charge of
YR 350 ($78) are estimated for the standard connection.    The charge is con-
siderably less than the estimated rate of YR 2.5 to YR 3.8 per m3 currently
charged, and it reflects the long-term marginal cost of water. A higher
connection charge will be made for larger connections. To ease the burden
on poorer members of the community, the Government has agreed, in principle,
to concessional charges for lower income families either through graduated
tariffs or a flow-regulating connection. For the very poor, water will be
available from public taps attached to mosques and financed by the Ministry
of Awkaf (Religious Trusts). Consultant services would be provided under the
project to prepare a tariff schedule, which will be introduced after consulta-
tion with the Association.
25.       The income of NWSA will be modest initially despite these tariff
levels, and the rate of return on net fixed assets will be low. During the
construction period, NWSA's income should meet operating expenses due in part
to the income received from the Sana'a Development Board's system. After
completion of the project, the return on net fixed assets is estimated to
rise from 1 percent in 1979 to 5 percent in 1984 and not less than 7.5 per-
cent by 1987.
26.       The long period that will be required to attain an adequate finan-
cial rate of return is attributable to four major factors: a) water consump-
tion is presently very low, and it will take some time for normal demand pat-
terns to develop. Therefore the system will be under-utilized initially which
will result in high per unit operating costs; b) Sana'a is a heterogeneous



- 6 -
city -- households which can immediately afford to convert to the system are
not concentrated in any particular sector of the city. The distribution system
will thus need to cover the entire city, resulting in a higher capital cost per
household connected; c) the NWSA will have additional investment requirements
to extend the system after the project is completed; and d) the NWSA must employ
staff, undertake training and incur development costs for projects in other
urban centers (para 21).
Operating Assistance and Training
27.       An experienced water engineer and technicians would be provided to
assist in establishing and operating the water supply system during the ini-
tial years until local personnel have gained the necessary experience. Six
expatriates would be recruited for 18-24 months each. Because of Arabic
language requirements, this technical assistance should be provided from a
Middle Eastern water authority or experienced consulting firm. In addition,
consultants would be provided for supervision of construction, preparation of
a tariff structure and billing system, and preparation of detailed engineering
for the Hodeida water supply system. The Hodeida project is currently scheduled
for FY 1978.
28.       Training for staff of the water authority will be an essential
element of the project. In addition, to the on-the-job training to be pro-
vided by the technical assistance team, seven senior NWSA employees would
go abroad for periods of up to nine months for theoretical and practical
training in their specialities. Most of this training will be done before
the system is put into operation. Training for skilled workers will be
carried out by USAID under their on-going training program for staff of the
Taiz water supply authority. Office personnel would receive instruction at
the UNDP-financed Public Administration Institute in Sana'a.
Economic Justification
29.       The present water supply position in Sana'a is critical.    Most of
the wells are contaminated, the water table is steadily falling and substan-
tial expenditure is being incurred for stop-gap measures to provide minimum
supplies. Unless urgent measures are taken to improve the situation, living
conditions will become intolerable. The YAR Government has no alternative
but to proceed with this project, which is the least cost solution, if the
basic water supply needs of the present population of Sana'a are to be met
and provision made for the future development of the city. The principal
objective of the project is to improve living conditions by providing the
city with its first public water supply system and establishing a competent
national water authority. The rate of return on the water supply investment
program (of which this project is the first and major component) is 10.0 per-
cent if benefits are measured by incremental revenues. This, however, does
not reflect the health benefits from a safe water supply, and excludes the
social benefits of providing an adequate supply of water to the urban poor
at tariffs matched to their ability to pay.

Implementation, Procurement and Disbursements
30.       The schedule for implementing the project foresees the completion
of final engineering and tender documents, presently in progress under the
UNDP/W1O project, by early 1974.   Construction would begin in late 1974 and
be completed in 1977. A limited amount of water would be available in 1975.
The NWSA would acquire the water supply facilities of the Sana'a Development
Board in mid-1974. Training programs would be initiated as soon as the Credit
is effective.
31.       All equipment supply and civil works contracts, except minor con-
tracts for maintenance, office equipment and contracts for installation of
house connections (amounting in total to about US$300,000), would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in conformity with the Bank
Group's Guidelines for Procurement. Construction contracts would be combined
as far as practicable to encourage bids from foreign contractors. Local firms
will be used for installation of house connnections and are expected to ob-
tain several sub-contracts.
32.       The proposed credit would be disbursed on the basis of 85 percent
of the cost of construction contracts; the CIF cost of imported equipment,
85 percent of locally procured imported equipment and the ex-factory cost of
locally-produced equipment; 100 percent of the total costs of consulting serv-
ices and 100 percent of the total cost of training and operating assistance.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Yemen Arab Republic and the
Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits
for water supply projects.
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
35.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed devel-
opment credit.

B.    Other Bank Group Activities
A Bank grant of US$200,000 equivalent was approved by the Executive
Directors in July 1971, to help finance, jointly with the Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development, a team of planning and economic advisors. The team
of five advisors has helped establish the Central Planning Organization (CPO)
which is responsible for preparing a development program, devising general
economic policies, identifying and preparing investment projects, and coor-
dinating external aid. The CPO is perhaps the most dynamic and active public
sector organization in Yemen. The Executive Directors approved on September 11,
1973 a Bank grant of US$200,000 equivalent to make possible the continuation
of the planning team.

for the UNESCO Task Force to help strengthen the Ministry of Education. An
equipment specialist has visited nine project schools to prepare lists of
equipment to be provided under the project.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understandine that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.
