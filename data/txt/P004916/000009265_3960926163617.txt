MEMORANDUM AND RECObMMNDATION OF THE PRE;IDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BA-NK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED lOAN
TO BANQUE DE L'AGRICULTURE ET DEVELOPPEMENT RURAL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT'
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
X.        Banque de l'Agriculture et du Developpement Rural (BADR) for US$110.0 million
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan which would finance an
agricultural credit project would have a term of 15 years, including 5 years
of grace, at the standard variable IBRD interest rate.  The Bank Loan would be
guaranteed by the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria. The project
would be cofinanced by the Export Import Bank of Japan for US$110.0 million
equivalent.
2.       BackRround.  At Independence in 1962, Algeria was an agrarian society
with a small industrial base. The basis of Algeria's economic policy was the
promotion of industrialization and reduced dependence on foreign investments
and imports, through centralized planning, reliance on public enterprises in
industry and se;vices, an agrarian reform which included land reform with the
creation of state farms, and a shift from the export orientation developed
during the colonial period to meeting domestic food requirements.  Zhe
strategy, fueled by the development of hydrocarbons, met with some success;
the economy grew at 61 p.a. during the 1970s, compared to 31 p.a. for middle
income countries as a group. This and other achievements were, however,
accompanied by serious disequilibria. In the early 1980s, there were cautious
shifts in economic policy that emphasized improved management and efficiency
of the economy. Policy reform became all the more urgent as most economic
indicators fell sharply in response to the 1986 oil-shock. Growth slowed from
3.91 p.a. over the 1980-85 period to 1.0 in 1986, 1.31 in 1987 and an
estimated 0.81 in 1988.
3.       Responding to the oil-shock and the new policy direction, Government
initiated a series of reforms cutting across most sectors of the eccunomy.
These reforms aim to decentralize the economy, make it more responsive and
market oriented, increase its efficiency through better use of existing
capacity, and place greater reliance on the small but growing private sector.
In the agricultural sector Government has initiated profound reforms, notably
the breakup of the state farm sector which accounted for about 60-701 of the
agricultural potential of the country. In the banking sector, the banks have
become autonomous, with bank lending no longer guaranteed by Government and
banks now responsible for resource mobilization and their lending programs.
The World Bank has been asked by the authorities for an increased level of
assistance to sitpport these far-reaching structural reforms and we are
currently working jointly with the authorities on these difficult adjustment
problems in agriculture, the f',ancial sector and industry.
4.       While agriculture's contribution to GDP has declined since
Independence it remains one of the main sectors in the economy; some 251 of
the labor force is employed in agriculture. The growth of the sector over the
past 20 years, at about 2.8S in constant terms, has been insufficient to keep



-2-
pace uith the growing demand for food. Algeria now imports 702 of its basic
food requirements, compared to only about 30S twenty years ago. Yields of
most principal crops have stagnated and remain considerably below those of
neighboring countries with similar climates and soil conditions. With the
%recent (1987/88) dissolution and privatization of the state farms, investments
in agriculture will now be made in a highly favorable environment to bring
about increased growth. Government intends to channel more resources for
agricultural investment through credit to farmers and to strengthen
agricultural services.
5.       BADW     The Banque de lAgriculture et du D6veloppement Rural (BADR)
was established in 1982. With about 200 branch offices and 5,300 staff, BADR
is the largest bank in Algeria in terms of infrastructure and number of
personnel. Since its first full year of operation in 1983, 502 of its lending
has gone to agriculture and 951 of its total lending benefitted the public
sector (state marketing agencies and state farms). While the number of
individual, small-scale farmers using BADR's credit has grown fivefold since
1983, it represents only 72 of the total population of these farmers.
6.       Like the other five commercial banks in Algeria, BADR until 1987
served primarily as a channel for Treasury funds, allocated for public sector
investments on the basis of centrally planned objectives. These loans were
implicitly guaranteed by Government. In addition, public enterprises were
required to keep their accounts at the bank which held the monopoly on banking
transactions in their sector. As a result, BADR made little effort to
mobilize or to channel resources to the private sector, and had no competition
as the banker for agricultural activities.
7.       With the introduction of banking reform (para. 3) and the autonomy of
enterprises, together with the dismantling of the state farms and
establishment of private farmers' groups, Exploitations Agricoles Collectives
(EACs), BADR faces an entirely new situation. BADR must now mobilize its own
resources to lend, at its own risk, to the new EACs, as well as to a large
population of individual, small-scale farmers whose needs have in the past
been largely ignored. To facilitate this, BADR will be free to set its own
lending interest rates up to twice the rediscount rate, within the context of
a more competitive banking environment. The growth and complexity of BADR's
new responsibilities will call for a strengthening of BADR's lending
procedures and capacity for investment planning and analysis. Although the
reform process is still underway and therefore the final picture is not fully
defined, the project comes at a critical time to help SADR's development and             4
to support the privatization of agriculture in Algeria.
8.       Project Preparation Facility.  To enable BADR to prepare for an
effective start-up of the Project, a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for
US$750,000 equivalent was approved in March 1987. This provided funds for:
(a) technicai assistance to prepare a Master Plan for a training program for
BADR staff; (b) techaical assistance to prepare a Master Plan for a Management
Information System (MIS) in BADR; (c) selected items of computer hardware
which would permit expansion of the computerized network in BADR. The Master
Plans are expected to be completed and the equipment in place shortly after
project effectiveness.
9.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The large reform program underway in
Algeria needs both financial support and support for institutional changes to
(3576E)



-3-
succeed. After a period of limited contact with the Bank in the early 1980's,
the Government of Algeria hbs now requested assistance in a number of areas,
but particularly in agriculture, to ensure the success of the current
reforms. Bank support Is planned to provide better input distribution,
extension and research, improved irrigation planning, infrastructure and
maintenance, and agricultural credit. The proposed Loan would be the first
for agricultural credit in Algeria and would help BADR's transition from a
channel for Government funds servicing the state farming sector to an
autonomous institution meeting the needs of privatized activities. Given the
important reforms underway throughout the economy, it comes at a critical
time; it is therefore an opportune time for Bank inv__vement to support BADR.
It would also complement Government's and Bank's other efforts to improve
services and supplies to the agricultural sector.
10.      Proiect Objectives.  The primary objective of the Project would be to
strengthen RADR as an agricultural credit institution, capable of carrying out
its mandate and operating with an effective staff and management system. It
would assist BADR to develop a medium-term strategy to ensure a sound future
and provide urgently needed foreign exchange for investment in agriculture and
private agro-industry. It would also provide a framework for reaching
agreement with Government on the appropriate measures and environment required
to ensure BADR's long-term viability.
Proiect Description
11.      The proposed Project would support a two-year time slice of the
following activities:
(a) Investment Credit
(i)   on-farm investments:  BADR's two-year program of medium- and
long-term (MELT) lending for on-farm investments, including
tractorsq,pumps, motors and sprinkler equipment for irrigation,
sprayers; and light utility and other transport vehicles.
During the ttm-year period about 13,500 EACs, slightly more
than half their number, would receive MNLT loans, and about
7,500 individual farmers.
(ii) investments in agro-industry: BADR's two-year program of
lending for investments in small-scale private agro-industry,
*                       including small food processing plants, bakeries, cold storage,
or production of agricultural implements or services. Because
of a strong demand and an improved access to credit following
the economic reforms, BADR's lending program for these
activities is expected to grow rapidly in this sector from a
modest level of DA 13 million in 1986 to about DA 65 million by
1990.
(b) Management Information System (MIS): This component would upgrade
BADR's accounting system to provide BADR with more complete
information on its operations and to allow for a greater degree of
decentralization. Technical assistance, financed under the PPF,
would develop, together with BADR, a Master Plan for the MIS, to
determine the information flows, hardware, software, and training
(3s76Z)



-4-
required for BADR staff and the costs of such a system.  The results
of the Master Plan would be the basis for financing a two-year time
slice of the implementation of the plan.
(c) Training: This component involves a two-year time-slice of a
Training Master Plan, currently being developed with technical
assistance under the PPF. The Plan would identify priority internal
and external training needs and the resources required to carry these
out over a 5-year period; it would also provide for training of BAD
staff, equipment and materials to enable them to provide in-service
training, and financing of courses and training programs for BADR
staff in Algeria and overseas.
(d) Technical Assistance: In addition to the technical assistance
required for development of the two Master Plans noted above, the
Project would also finance short-term consultants to provide input
for BADR's medium-term strategy (5 staff months); to provide input
and on-the-job training for lending in agro-industrial activities (4
staff months); and technical assistance for external auditing (about
4 staff months).
12.      The total project cost is estimated at US$617.0 million including
taxes and duties with a foreign exchange component of US$363.0 million. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. The proposed Bank loan of $110.0 million would
finance about 181 of project costs and 302 of the estimated foreign exchange
costs of the project. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group Operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. A map is also attached, as is the Staff Appraisal Report No.
7080-ALG, dated November 7, 1988.
13.      Actions Agreed:  BADR has agreed that:  (a) the Master Plans for both
the training program and the MIS would be completed by March 31, 1989; (b)
BADR would make subloans for agro-iadustrial investments on the basis of
agreed lending criteria; (c) arrangements for procurement, subsequent
distribution and reimbursement between BADR and the procurement agencies would
be satisfactory to the Bank; (d) the reflows from the proceeds of the loan
would continue to be used for agricultural and agro-industrial lending
activities; (e) BADR would transmit to the Bank for review and comment by June
30, 1989: (1) a draft revised set of terms and conditions for private sector
lending (current terms and conditions are adequate for the purposes of this
Project, but can be improved to take advantage of the recent changes and the
expected expansion in lending to individual farmers); (2) a draft policy
statement of medium-term strategy; (3) a policy for writing off bad debts; (f)
BADR would finalize and implement the conditions, the strategy and the policy
in (e) by no later than June 30, 1990; (g) BADR would ensure sufficient
provisioning for the risks on all subloans; (h) BADR would maintain its equity
at no less than the level as of December 31, 1987; (i) BADR would maintain a
current ratio of no less than 1 to 5, with the current ratio being defined as
the ratio of current assets excluding short term loans to current liabilities;
(j) interest rates would be set each year at levels sufficient to cover the
administrative and financial costs of BADR's operations.
(3 s s)

14.      Project Benefits.  The most important long term benefits from the
Project would be institutional, since the Project's main objective is to
develop BADR into an effective agricultural credit institution. In addition,
the Project would support investments by EACs at a critical time in their
development, thereby providing important support for the agricultural reform
program. Directly quantifiable benefits can be expected from an increase in
agricultural production due to these investments. Relevant farm models
indicate that economic rates of return of individual investments are expecteid
to range between 10 to 472 while financial rates of return will range bet.een
23% and 392. Because of the flexibility in the use of the Loan across types
of investments, no aggregate rate of return has been estimated for the Project
as a whole.
15.      Risks.  To reduce the risk that inadequate progress is made in
institution building, a PPF was approved in March 1987 to establish Master
Plans for training and for the MIS for implementation during the Project.
Second, with the substantial reforms currently underway, BADR could facirsome
unusual transitional risks which could affect its financial situation. s
Arrangements have therefore been introduced under the Project to safeguard
BADR's financial status during this transition period. Third, implementation
may be slow because a number of agencies involved in procurement are
unfamiliar with Bank procedures. While this risk will be addressed by
reaching agreement on standard bidding documents, close Bank supervision will
still be required prior to and shortly aft:ir Project effectiveness.
18.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply
with the articles of agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
