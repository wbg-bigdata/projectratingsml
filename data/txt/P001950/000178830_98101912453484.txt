NIGER
DOSSO AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Project Background
1.01      In March 1977, Government informed an RMWA mission of its interest
in obtaining Bank Group assistance to expand an ongoing FAC-financed agricul-
tural development project in Dosso Province. RMWA participated in drawing up
terms of reference for a feasibility study, for which FAC financed a consul-
tant team that completed work in April 1978; the study proposed a broad rural
development project costing about US$50 million. Meantime, a Belgian aid
mission which had visited Dosso in mid-1977 proposed a much smaller project,
concentrating on wells, bottomland development, and feeder road studies. To
reconcile the differences between the two project proposals, Government
decided in May 1978 that a supplementary feasibility study be undertaken by
two consultants, for which the Bank Group agreed to provide PPF financing of
US$30,000. This report was completed by end-October and an appraisal mission
visited Niger in November-December 1978. The project now proposed for con-
-sideration by IDA focusses on smallholder farmers; while the main activities
would be in rainfed farming, bottomland developments and livestock activities
would also be included. The project would not include village water supplies,
which would be financed under a separate Belgian project, nor feeder roads,
which would be financed under the IDA feeder road project approved in
March 1979 covering four Provinces, including Dosso.
B. The Rural Sector
1.02      Human Geography.  Niger has a population of about 5 million of whom
over 4 million live in rural areas. The country covers 1.3 million km2, of
which 75% is desertic, 15% semi-arid, and less than 10% suitable for crop
production and even this is of limited potential. About half the people live
between the southern border with Nigeria, where annual rainfall is 700-800 mm,
and the 500 mm isohyet. In this area of about 100,000 km2, population density
averages only 20/km1 but exceeds 100/km2 in the more favorable locations in
valleys; the main crops are millet and sorghum, groundnuts, cowpeas and some
cotton. Further north, as rainfall declines and becomes more variable,
rainfed cropping becomes increasingly precarious and livestock activities
increasingly important.
1.03      Share in GDP and Exports.  Since 1970, the rural sector's share of
GDP has dropped from 60% to 45%, and its share of exports from 80% to 30%.
This dramatic change reflects the rapid rise in uranium production but also



- 2 -
slow development of the rural sector. Recent crop production has been dis-
appointing, particularly groundnut production which has declined - due to
previously prevailing low producer prices, disease, drought and subsequent
seed stock problems - from 250,000 tons (shelled) to about 100,000 tons.
Although farmers have switched into grains and cowpeas, crops now account for
less than 30% of GDP and 10% of exports. Livestock production was disrupted
by the 1973 drought which, according to Government estimates, reduced the
national herd from 4.2 million cattle to 2.2 million, and from 9 million
smallstock to 7 million. Although herd reconstitution has begun, pre-drought
cattle numbers will not be reached for another decade. Increases in prices of
livestock products have, however, largely offset the reduced volume of pro-
duction; livestock now accounts for 15% of GDP and 20% of exports.
1.04      Food Balance.  Before 1973, Niger was self-sufficient in basic
foodstuffs in normal years. Over the three drought years 1973-75 however,
cereal imports averaged about 120,000 tons/year, equivalent to only about 10%
of normal annual production but a much higher proportion, perhaps 50%, of
marketed production. This disquieting experience drew attention to cereal
production - a hitherto neglected subsector - and this attention has not
waned despite good harvests in 1976/77 and 1978/79. Although some recent
projections have suggested that there would likely be an important millet and
sorghum deficit in the years to come, present indications are that, provided
rainfed farming productivity projects are implemented as envisaged, Niger will
-continue to be about self-sufficient in cereals but that production will be
vulnerable to the vagaries of climate. In good years surpluses will be
marketable in northern Nigeria - unless there is a good year throughout the
area; poor-year deficits will be met by imports, but the probability of a
drought as severe as that of 1973 is low (0.02).
1.05      Institutions.  The Ministry of Rural Development, which has main
but not sole responsibility for the rural sector, is divided into four Depart-
ments: Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Engineering and Forestry; there is
also a small, recently-established planning unit attached to the Minister's
Cabinet. The Union Nigerienne de Credit et de Cooperation (UNCC), established
in 1962, is responsible for cooperative development, input supply, seasonal
and medium-term credit recovery, and primary marketing, as well as the manage-
ment of some agricultural projects. The Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole
(CNCA), established as an offshoot from UNCC in 1967, is responsible for
provision of funds for agricultural credit, review of loan applications, and
bookkeeping for consolidated cooperatives' accounts. Para--public companies
have been set up to compete with the private sector in secondary marketing,
processing and subsequent retail distribution of the main crops. The Societe
Nigerienne d'Arachide (SONARA) handles both groundnuts and cowpeas, volumes of
which have fluctuated widely as a result of weather but also erratic pricing;
the cowpea volume bought by SONARA declined from 50,000 tons in 1976/77 to
4,100 tons in 1977/78; the groundnut volume, which was regularly over 150,000
tons (shelled) in the late 1960s and early 1970s, has not exceeded 15,000 tons
in the three years through 1977/78. The Office des Produits Vivriers du Niger



(OPVN) handles millet and sorghum, between 10,000 and 60,000 tons/year pur-
chased locally, and processed rice, about 3,000 tons/year. OPVN has also been
responsible for internal distribution of food aid.
1.06      Input Pricing.  Government pursues a policy of heavy subsidies on
agricultural inputs. Although input prices are not announced sufficiently in
advance to enable farmers to place orders on the basis of known prices, prices
have not been changed for several years. Accordingly, the subsidy element has
been increasing and, in 1978/79, reached 60% on fertilizer, about 70% on small
animal-drawn implements, and about 40% on carts. Whereas unit prices for
inputs are decided by the Minister of Rural Development, on the basis of
proposals submitted by UNCC, the aggregate subsidy amount is fixed by the
Ministry of Planning as part of the annual capital budget. Since the aggregate
amount is insufficient to finance acquisition of volumes demanded at the
subsidized unit prices, inputs are necessarily rationed. Moreover, since
tenders for supply of inputs are not issued until the capital budget allocation
is known, in practice a good part of the inputs is delivered too late. Data
on input use - less than 4,000 tons of fertilizer nationwide for rainfed
farming - do not therefore reflect demand but rather rationed, untimely supply.
1.07      Output Pricing.  Prices payable by the para-public marketing agencies
for millet, sorghum, groundnuts, cowpeas, cotton and paddy are fixed by a
National Price Committee chaired by the Minister of Economic Affairs. As in
most West African countries, prices are announced in October, just before the
opening of the primary markets, and are therefore relevant only to the follow-
ing season's planting decisions. In the last few years, however, uncertainties
have been exacerbated by (a) the reduction in the producer price for cowpeas
in the 1975/76 season after the markets had opened and (b) the increase in the
producer price for all crops in the 1977/78 season after the markets had been
operating for three months. Prices announced for the 1978/79 season all show
a significant increase over the previous year's initial prices and are, in
fact, close to economic prices; the producer price payable at primary markets
as a percentage of the economic price is 80% for millet and sorghum, 90% for
cowpeas and cotton, 100% for paddy, and 110% for groundnuts. The recent price
increases reflect a recognition of the necessity to compete with the market in
Nigeria, where prices are not effectively controlled, and with the marketing
skills of Nigerien and Nigerian merchants.
C. Sector Strategy and Issues
1.08      Constraints and Challenges.  Apart from uranium, the country's
natural resource endowment is unusually poor. The climate imposes a severe
limit on the area where cultivation is possible, and even in that area,
uncertain rainfall makes farming a hazardous occupation. Soils are generally
poor and in many areas productivity is declining as fallow periods are being
shortened, reflecting increased land pressure stemming from population growth
of perhaps 3% per year. The decline in productivity may, in many areas, have
reached a point where it is now worthwhile to intensify land use. Water,
though abundant underground, is found in only a few valleys and large-scale



- 4 -
irrigation is costly, in excess of US$10,000/ha. Distances, both internal and
external, are enormous, putting Niger at a disadvantage with competitors in
export markets (over US$100/ton to ocean port). Despite the expansion in
uranium production and related activities, productive employment opportunities
outside the rural sector cannot increase by more than a few thousand per year,
yet the working age population increases by 40,000-50,000 each year. Unless
income opportunities can be expanded in the rural sector, present dry-season
migration to neighboring countries will increase and perhaps become permanent.
1.09      Oblectives and Strategies.  Government has responded to these
constraints and challenges by selecting a two-fold objective: to exploit the
potential in rainfed crop and livestock production, and to increase the area
under controlled irrigation. The strategy in rainfed agriculture is to set up
a regional "Productivity Project" in each province whereby improved services
of extension, input supply, credit and marketing would be made available to
smallholders. It is Government's intention that such projects should cover
the whole of the cultivable part of the country by 1980. By 1979 such proj-
ects, not always covering the whole of a province, were being implemented in
five of the six relevant provinces including Maradi, financed under Credit
608-NIR (US$10.7 million), and the existing FAC-financed pilot project for
Dosso Province. These projects differ in emphasis, in coverage of subsectors
and also in administrative structure. Government's strategy in controlled
irrigation is a modest rate of development, of about 1,200 ha per year, while
building the institutions that could later manage a more rapid rate of imple-
mentation of new perimeters. Full development of the countries considerable
irrigation potential along the Niger River (100,000 ha) would also depend on
the construction of the proposed Kandadji regulatory dam currently being
studied. For livestock, Government's strategy is not sharply focussed
since it includes both state-run enterprises and provision of services to
pastoralists. For the latter, Government has recently modified its position
which is now, in the semi-arid pastoral zone, a blend of its earlier approach
- provision of vaccinations and stock watering points - and the newly-
recognized need to increase animal and pastoral productivity by working
through associations of pastoralists. In the cropping zone, Government's
strategy is to encourage crop-livestock integration through promotion of
animal traction and animal feeding. In the long term, the livestock industry
is expected to become increasingly specialized by zone: breeding in the
semi-arid pastoral zone, backgrounding in the intermediate cereals zone, and
fattening in the southern mixed cropping zone. With the exceptions of state-
run livestock enterprises and the unwillingness to exclude any cultivated
area, however arid, from the "Productivity Projects", the strategies chosen by
Government are sound.
1.10      Policy Issues.  Significant improvements have recently been made in
output pricing, whereby financial prices have been moved close to economic
prices (para. 1.07), and in the cost of agricultural credit, for which the
interest rate was increased from 6.5% in 1977/78 to 8% in 1978/79 and then to
9.5% for 1979/80. Since average annual inflation over 1976-78 was 20% and
though it may be rather lower over the next three years, the real interest
rate would probably continue to be negative. No improvements have been made



in input prf1cing, since financial prices for inputs have been held constant
and have therefore moved further away from economic prices (para. 1.06);
negative real interest rates and heavily-subsidised inputs reflect Govern-
ment's desire to transfer income from uranium to the rural sector. Input
supply continues, however, to be inadequate, irregular and untimely. Improve-
ments have been made in access to credit through the growth of the cooperative
movement, and the introduction in 1977 of a cash down payment, set at 10%, on
agricultural implements, but there has been no significant improvement in the
credit repayment rate of 60% on seasonal inputs and implements. The repayment
rate does, however, vary considerably between provinces, depending on the
soundness of the local technical services as well as the attitude of the local
administrative authorities.
1.11      Previous Bank Involvement.  Since 1969, six credits have been
approved for the agricultural sector. The first, Credit 207-NIR for US$0.6
million, signed in 1970, was designed to provide smallholders with credit for
seasonal inputs and implements, and to strengthen the cooperative movement.
As the Completion Report 1/ concludes, "the project was an unfortunate under-
taking" since (a) it concentrated on financial aspects of agricultural credit
without providing for specific structured actions aimed at improving produc-
tion technology at the field level; (b) the key agency, UNCC, provided no
extension services to groundnut farmers; (c) the project period, 1971-74,
coincided with severe droughts; and (d) until late 1974, Government adopted a
unremunarative producer price policy. Instead of a 100% rate of return as
estimated at appraisal the actual rate of return, not quantified in the
Completion Report, was barely positive. The second Credit, made in 1974 for
the Drought Relief Project, Credit 441-NIR for US$2 million, financed a
variety of small subprojects which were generally executed satisfactorily.
The third Credit 608-NIR for US$10.7 million, for the Maradi Agricultural
Development Project was approved in December 1975 but did not become effective
until October 1976. The iroject has satisfactorily completed two agricultural
seasons and a follow-up p7ofect including a sizeable irrigation component, is
under preparation. The fourth Credit, approved in May 1978 for the Forestry
Project, Credit 800-NIR for US$4.5 million, will finance 400 ha of pilot
irrigated tree plantations and 700 ha of rainfed plantations as well as some
rural forestry activities. The fifth Credit, approved in September 1978 for
the Namarigoungou Irrigation Project, Credit 851-NIR for US$15 million, will
primarily finance a new 7,500 ha perimeter.  The sixth Credit, for the Live-
stock Prolect, Credit 885-NIR for US$12 million, was approved in March 1979.
Located in the center and east of the country, it will finance an innovative
approach to provision of a package of services to pastoralists in the semi-
arid pastoral zone and a series of specific livestock-related actions in the
cropping zone.
1.12      Sector Lending Strategy.  Bank Group investments in the agricultural
sector should support Government's generally sound strategy, namely regional
productivity projects, gradual development of the country's irrigation poten-
tial, provision of services to pastoralists, and crop-livestock integration.

It must also be recognized, however, that with present technical knowledge and
the severity of the constraints on rural production, the scope 'or worthwhile
investments in rainfed crop and livestock production is limited and could be
exhausted in the next decade. Already, there are many areas that are regularly
cultivated but in which no worthwhile investments can be made; the tracing of
the demarcation line is not easy and Government is understandabLy concerned to
be perceived as doing something for everyone. Bank Group investments will,
nonetheless, have to trace such a line and, tak:Lng due account of the hetero-
geneity of the countryside, stay within it.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Physical Features
2.01      Location and Climate.  The project area (see Map, 14214) comprises
Dosso Province which covers about 31,000 km2. Located in the southwest of the
country between Benin and Nigeria, it includes five administrative districts:
Birni, Dosso, Doutchi, Gaya and Loga. The climate varies from sahelian in the
north, where average annual rainfall is 400 mm, concentrated in a 100-day
period, to sudanian in the extreme south at Gaya with 850 mm/year over 130
days. Inter-annual variations are also large and further complicate farm
decision-making. Radiation, temperature and sunlight hours peak in May and
are at their lowest in August when dull overcast conditions are common.
Potential evapotranspiration is highest in the north, averaging 7 mm/day in
May and falling to 4 mm/day in August. In December and January the harmattan,
an intensely drying wind from the Sahara, brings about a small but distinct
drop in temperature; daily minima fall to 150C, thus facilitating vegetable
production.
2.02      Topography and Soils.  Underlain with tertiary sandstones, the area
consists of a monotonous plateau of sandy soils, 200-240 m above sea level,
broken by dry, ancient river valleys (dallols) of which the two largest,
the Dallol Maouri in the east of the area and the Dallol Bosso in the west,
stretch north-south for over 400 km. To the southwest, the plateau is broken
by the Niger River valley. The cultivable area is estimated at 23,000 km2 and
four main soil types can be distinguished.  Plateau soils, which account for
19,000 km2, are sandy, frequently shallow, with numerous laterite outcrops
and, even in the ancient tributaries of the dallols where the deeper soils
have fair water-holding capacity, fertility is poor; such soils are being
increasingly cultivated but they cannot withstand continuous cropping under
present techniques. Terrace soils, found at the foot of the escarpments
between the plateau and the dallols, are sandy-clays that are already being
fully exploited. Sandy dallol soils of mainly alluvial origin have low
exchange capacity and their content in loam and clay rarely exceeds 10%; these
soils are also heavily exploited at present and mineral deficiencies are
showing up. Both terrace and sandy dallol soils have higher potential for
rainfed farming than indicated by rainfall because they have reasonable



-7-
water-holding capacity and, being low-lying, receive surface and subsurface
runoff. Hydromorphic dallol soils are gray, often contain more than 10%
organic matter and are generally of good potential; in continuously-cropped
areas, however, magnesium and other deficiencies have been observed. Since in
some spots saline and alkaline soils have been observed, as well as phreatic
water with a high sodium content, sites for small-scale irrigation have to be
carefully selected.
2.03      Water and Vegetation.  Other than the Niger River, there are no
permanent watercourses in the project area. On the plateau, water is generally
found at 50 m and the need to dig through laterized sandstone strata to reach
it impedes settlement and cultivation. In the dallols, by contrast, water is
available at only a few meters, is readily accessible by hand-dug wells, and
is used both for domestic purposes and small-scale irrigation. The shallow
aquifer frequently comes to the surface and the dallols contain innumerable
small ponds. The vegetation varies from semi-arid savannah with sparse tree
cover in the north to heavily-wooded savannah including much borassus palm in
the south. There are important populations of Gao (acacia albida) which are
used for dry-season forage and Nere (parkia biglobasa), used for an oily
condiment.
B. Socio-Economic Features
2.04      Demography.  The total population of the project area is about
700,000: by district-Birni 130,000, Dosso 150,000, Doutchi 260,000, Gaya
110,000 and Loga 60,000. There are five towns with more than 5,000 inhabi-
tants, accounting for less than 10% of the population; the mass of the
people live in 1,250 villages with an average population of 500. There are
important differences in settlement patterns: whereas the average population
per village in Doutchi administrative district is 1,100 it is less than 400
in Birni and Dosso. Data obtained from administrative censuses suggest
population growth of nearly 3% per year in the decade through 1965 but of
only about 2% per year in the following decade. This decline is due to
increased infant mortality in the drought years of the early 1970s, but
probably also reflects increased seasonal migration by young men. Whereas
average population density is only 23/km2 and, between administrative dis-
tricts, ranges from only 16/km2 in Dosso to 28/km2 in Gaya, these figures
disguise severe differences between the plateau and the dallols and within
the dallols; local population density frequently exceeds 100/kmn in the
dallols, particularly in the northern Dallol Bosso and the central Dallol
Maouri (Map 14214).
2.05      The People.  The three main ethnic groups are the Hausa, Djerma and
Fulani, respectively 50%, 40% and 10% of the population. The Hausa live
primarily in the east, are concentrated in the Dallol Maouri around Doutchi
and, prior to the tracing of the anglophone/francophone boundary in 1900, were
under the authority of the Sultanate of Sokoto; close personal and commercial
ties are still maintained with Sokoto. Hausa women participate fully in rainy



- 8 -
season cultivation, while dry-season field work is handled almost exclusively
by the men. The Djerma live primarily in the west, in the Dallol Bosso; the
Djerma wermen do not participate in rainy season cultivation, yet are almost
exclusively responsible for dry-season field wo-k.  The Fulani are more
scattered but generally sedentarized and, from a permanent hone base, practice
short-cycle transhumance to the Niger River val Ley, and on into Benin.  All
three groups, but particularly the Djerma and the Hausa, practice seasonal
migration to the coastal countries: spot surveys suggest that 50% of econo-
mically-active men migrate, but not until after the second weeding. Such
dry-season migration is an important feature of rural life in Dcosso Province,
with the sole exception of Gaya administrative district. The effect of this
seasonal migration is difficult to assess; however, given that improved
agricultural techniques require only that participating farmers shorten rather
than abandon their seasonal migration, the risk of farm labor shortage is
limited.
2.06      Land Tenure.  The basic pattern of land ownership and usage in the
project area has been the so-called communal land tenure system, under which
traditional leaders are considered to be the custodians of all ]and in their
areas of jurisdiction, and are empowered to grant usufruct to heads of families.
Theoretically, all lands could be repossessed by the community acting through
the chief and the elders on the death or departure of the usufructaries. In
practice, however, lands are generally inheritable through the family. At the
discretion of the head of the family, land can also be divided among family
members, or leased out to other families, or even to strangers; sale of
farmland is, however, traditionally frowned upon or even prohibited. For all
practical purposes, communal ownership is effectively exercised only in respect
of vacant or virgin land and an individual or family, once granted a piece of
land, would enjoy effective security of tenure.
C. Institutions and Infrastructure
2.07      Local Government.  A Governor for each of the seven provinces is
appointed by and is the direct representative of the President.
The Governor chairs the Provincial Technical Committee which includes as
members all provincial heads of government departments, district Sub-Governors
and representatives of chiefs. This Committee is responsible for coordination
between government departments but has no budgetary authority, which is
retained by the ministries in Niamey. Committees with a similar membership
exist at the administrative district level; chaired by the Sub-Governor, they
are also coordinating bodies but with some modest budgetary authority arising
from power of allocation of local tax revenues. Administrative districts are
divided into cantons governed by a chief, who is elected by the chiefs of the
villages concerned and receives a government allowance; the canton is the
point of contact between modern government and traditional authority. A
weakness of the system is that provincial heads of government departments are
subject to directives from both their technical superiors in their ministry
and from their politico-administrative superiors in the Governor's office.

2.08      Agricultural Services.  The Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry
Departments of the Ministry of Rural Development are well, though inadequately,
represented in Dosso Province; the Rural Engineering Department has no staff
or facilities there. The Agricultural Research Institute (INRAN) undertakes
some research, directed from Niamey, but none concerning rainfed farming.
Although UNCC (para. 1.05) was created in 1962, it is only in the last few
years that efforts, sometimes too hastily, have been made to establish coop-
eratives throughout Dosso; there are now 11 cooperative unions, 46 coopera-
tives and 375 village-level mutual guarantee groups serviced by a network of
16 warehouses of which four are located in administrative district centers.
In late 1978, government decided to reorganize the cooperative structure so
that cooperatives could correspond to an agricultural extension district of
about 3,000 families.
2.09      Marketing and Processing.  SONARA (para 1.05), through cooperative
markets or, mainly in Gaya administrative district, through licensed agents,
provides an effective collection service for groundnuts and cowpeas. It has
a groundnut shelling plant in Dosso town with a capacity of 25,000 tons
unshelled nuts per year, though its purchases in Dosso Province have averaged
only 3,000 tons/year over the last decade. Purchases of cowpeas averaged over
10,000 tons/year in 1974/75 - 1976/77 but fell to 1,000 tons in 1977/78. OPVN
purchases of millet and sorghum are insignificant, averaging 300 tons/year.
CFDT handles cotton extension work and marketing, and operates a ginnery at
Gaya with a capacity of 2,000 tons/ year; purchases of seed cotton average
only 200 tons/year and have been declining. These parastatal agencies together
with a handful of licensed traders are the sole authorized buyers from the
cooperatives. The proximity of Nigeria and Benin, the permeability of the
frontier, and past Government price policies ensure, however, that private
buyers with well-established networks are operative in the area (para 1.07).
Livestock marketing is managed through a traditional private system in which
herdowners sell stock either directly or through professional collection
agents to large traders. There are many livestock markets of which the most
important, notably Mokko, cater for both local and inter-provincial trade;
none of the markets has facilities for cattle handling or veterinary control.
Most of the cattle offtake but less than half of the smallstock offtake is
exported. Animals are moved on the hoof into Nigeria, and then by road and
rail to the south. Cattle exports are presently regulated by a licensing
system which, while not entirely effective, is nonetheless a nuisance for all
involved in cattle trading. For local consumption, there are no modern
abattoirs but there is a network of slaughter slabs with hide and skin drying
facilities.
2.10      Roads and Communications.  Located in the center of the Province,
Dosso town is linked by paved roads to Birni (33 km) and then Niamey
(140 km) in the northwest, to Gaya (95 km) and then Cotonou in the south,
and to Doutchi (137 km) and then Maradi and Kano to the northeast. A good
laterite road runs north from Dosso through Loga (80 km), and another runs
through central Dallol Maouri. All other tracks are poor and, in the sandy
terrain, four-wheel drive vehicles are required. The IDA feeder road project
(para 1.01) will establish a brigade at Dosso, its first priority is a road



- 10 -
from Birni through northern Dallol Bosso, and subsequent priorities will be
determined in the light of the requirements of the project now proposed.
Dosso is linked by telephone to each of the administrative district capitals.
2.11      Power, Water, Health Services and Schools.  For power, Dosso town
has a diesel generator and will soon be linked to the existing Kainji Dam -
Niamey high-tension line; Doutchi and Gaya both have small diesel generators;
but there is no other existing or planned electrification in the province.
For water supply, six centers are equipped with tubewells and piped supply at
least to public water fountains; over half the rural population has access to
a modern cement-lined well; but there are over 400 villages with no improved
water source. For health, there are five hospitals, 23 dispensaries and eight
child-care centers which, together, constitute one hospital bed per 3,000
people, and one trained medical agent per 7,000.. To offset the scarcity of
trained staff, a village health worker training program has been set up and
there are presently over 300 unpaid paramedical workers in the field. A
further program starting in 1979 will focus on their follow-up and super-
vision. For education, there are 167 primary schools, generally with four
classes and 40 students per class; the primary school enrolment rate is still
under 20%. There are five secondary schools with a total of about 2,500
students, but no institutions of further education. An adult literacy program
has been operating for some years; enrolment in 1977/78 was only 1,300.
D. Land Use and Farm Income
2.12      Data Base.  Available information on land use, farm sizes, and crop
and livestock production is incomplete and sometimes contradictory; figures
given below are therefore 'best estimates', subject to wide margins of error.
One of the functions of project monitoring would be to provide more satis-
factory basic information, and the project would retain sufficient flexibility
to take account of such findings.
2.13      Land Use.  A 1967 soil survey classified 74% of ithe total area, or
2.3 million ha, as cultivable. This is a maximum estimate since the classifi-
cation was based on soil criteria alone, ignoring such factors as rainfall,
availability of drinking water, and accessibility. A 1973 aerial survey
covering 34% of Dosso Province, including each of the main ecological zones,
showed that 25% of the total area, or 775,000 ha, was cultivated, and that 14%
of the total area, or 420,000 ha, was in fallow. These data are updated to
1977 in Table 2.1. With about 90,000 farms, the average holding is 13 ha,
with 9 ha cultivated and 4 ha in fallow, but there are wide differences
between and within administrative districts reflecting rainfall, differences
in planting densities and the relative importance of dallol and plateau
farming.

2.14      Farm Structure.  All farms in the project area are small subsistence
farms in the sense that food for home consumption is the first priority in
farm decision-making, and nearly all field work is done manually by family
labor. Farm size is therefore mainly a function of family labor, subject to
the differing degrees to which women participate in cultivation (para 2.05).
This qualification is also relevant to the degree of concentration of farm
decision-making. Among the Djerma, family heads take all decisions on choice
of rainfed crops, timing and cultivation techniques; among the Hausa, the
women work both on the family fields, for which the family head is respon-
sible, and on their own fields. In the latter, where they are responsible
for all decisions, they customarily work for two days per week and are thereby
the decision-makers for up to 30% of the family's cultivated areas. Lower
priorities given to womens' fields make improvements difficult because these
fields are generally planted too late and applying fertilizer on such fields
would be wasteful. A family holding is usually fragmented into a number of
plots and increasingly so from south to north. Fragmentation has increased
where, in the most densely populated parts of the dallols, the only means of
expansion of cultivated area has been to open up new fields on the plateau.
Much loss of time results, and transport from field to farmstead or market
becomes more demanding. Since field preparation is limited to a simple
cleaning that can be extended over time, the key labor constraints are at
planting and weeding; planting is widely spaced, in holes, and at different
times and in different locations. Depending on rainfall and early plant
growth, the farmer then chooses which fields to weed. By harvest time, some
fields wil have been totally abandoned, others will have received only one
weeding, yet others will have been carefully maintained right through the
season. In general, in the north and center of the project area, only about
75% of the planted area is actually harvested; only in the extreme south does
a 'farm' correspond to an area that is planted and also harvested.
2.15      Crop Production.  The principal crops are millet, sorghum, cowpeas
and groundnuts. Other rainfed crops include voandzou (voandzeia subterranea)
a leguminous crop similar to groundnuts, maize, which is beginning to expand,
and some cotton. In addition, vegetables, sugar cane, paddy, cassava, sweet
potatoes and some fruits are grown on the bottomlands. Summary production
data are shown in Table 2.1. Millet covers about 90% of the harvested area
and is about 40% intercropped with cowpeas. Cowpeas are invariablly inter-
cropped, except where the existing Pilot Project (para. 2.19) has introduced
single-cropping in blocks. Sorghum is about 50% intercropped but groundnuts
are generally single-cropped. A consistent pattern of intercropping or
sequential cropping is, however, rarely found. In the dallols, where the
soils are most favorable and the population most dense, fertility is declining
as fallow periods are being shortened and even eliminated; yields are low and
probably declining. Elsewhere, intrinsically poor soils are being increas-
ingly cultivated and yields are also low.
2.16      Livestock Production.  The livestock population of the project area
is about 300,000 cattle, 600,000 smallstock, and about 20,000 each of horses,
donkeys and camels. The cattle are all zebu types, primarily Bororo and
Azawak, the latter being well suited to fattening and animal traction. The



- 13 -
animal health situation is broadly under control and, though vaccination
coverage is incomplete, there have been no significant losses from contagious
diseases for many years. Recently, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
threathened to re-emerge but it is being successfully combatted. The northern
limit of the tsetse fly cuts into the extreme south of Dosso Province and,
though not a serious threat, trypanocidal treatments are warranted. Most
of the cattle are managed but not necessarily owned by the Fulani people.
Although many crop farmers are also livestock owners, the integration of
livestock and crop farming is still limited. A modest link is obtained
through contracts between herdsmen and farmers whereby animals grazing crop
residues fertilize the fields. A more substantial link is increasingly
practised over much of the project area: crop residues are harvested and
stored for feeding to animals kept in farmers' compounds. Animal traction is
little used, but there is growing and largely unsatisfied demand for work oxen
and carts, donkey carts and, to a lesser extent, implements for cultivation.
Total annual production from cattle and smallstock is about 13,000 tons
liveweight and 12,000 tons of milk. Eggs and poultry production, almost
exclusively handled by women, is not known.
2.17      Farm Income.  Although estimates of farm income are rough orders of
magnitude, the relative levels and composition of farm income by administra-
tive district shown at Table 2.1 are generally coherent. Whereas provincial
average farm income is CFAF 185,000 (US$840) for a typical seven-member farm
family, district average farm income varies from CFAF 156,000 (US$710) at
Birni to CFAF 293,000 (US$1,330) at Gaya. Income from rainfed crops varies
even more widely, reflecting land productivity and the extent to which women
participate in rainy-season cultivation; while the provincial average is CFAF
144,000 (US$655), district averages vary from CFAF 105,000 (US$480) at Birni
to CFAF 222,000 (US$1,010) at Gaya. Although significant locally, income from
bottomland crops is a minor determinant of farm income at the district level.
Income from livestock accounts for 17% of provincial average farm income but
its relative share varies from 25% at Birni to 9% at Loga. The practice of
transhumance does, however, extend an unusual arbitrariness to estimations of
livestock population and income by district. In addition, and unlike crop
income which is a function of family labor and women's participation, live-
stock income is related to ownership. While this is not uniform, virtually
all farm families have some livestock, smallstock ownership is probably fairly
uniform, and income from cow's milk accrues to the herdsmen managers rather
than the owners; what is at stake for income distribution analysis is income
from cattle for slaughter. This amounts to CFAF 1.5 billion (US$7 million),
which is 52% of livestock income but only 9% of total farm income. Whereas
highly non-uniform cattle ownership would not therefore reduce incomes of
small cattle owners or non-owners appreciably, the amount at stake is such
that large owners' income could be much higher than others' incomes.
2.18      Target Group.  While there is much diversity between the south and
the north, and the dallols and the plateau, in farm size, crops and farming
practices, district average per capita farm incomes are remarkably similar,
with the exception of Gaya. For rainfed farming, district average per capita
incomes are more varied; with an index of 100 for Birni, such incomes elsewhere



- 14 -
are: Doutchi 120; Dosso and Loga 140; Gaya 210. Birni and Doutchi are the
two districts which exhibit the highest local population densities, the
lowest proportion of fallow to cultivated land, the clearest indications of
declining soil fertility and, probably, the highest incidence of seasonal
migration; they are the areas where land intensification would be most
warranted and also most profitable since present yields are so low and the
scope for area expansion so limited. Birni and Doutchi and, within these
districts, the most heavily populated areas are therefore the first-priority
zones for project interventions. This 'first' target group numbers about
300,000, with average per capita farm income of about US$100, and little
dispersion about the average except that occasioned by non-uniform distri-
bution of cattle ownership. By the end of the project, moreover, training,
extension, input supply and credit services would be made accessible to 80% of
the people in the project area. The remaining 20% are people farming in the
northernmost plateau country in Loga and Doutchi, and these families would
nonetheless receive some livestock services.
2.19      The Existing Pilot Project.  Beginning with the 1975/76 season, FAC
has financed a pilot project aimed at increasing yields of- cowpeas and millet,
increasing the area under cotton and, beginning in 1977/ 78, increasing yields
of groundnuts. Under this first broad-based rainfed farming project in Dosso
Province, these objectives were to be reached by extension, input supply
through credit-in-kind, and strengthening some of the existing government
services. The project also includes a cattle fattening component and a 30 ha
irrigated citrus plantation. The project was to end with the 1978/79 season
but FAC has agreed to continue its financing through 1979/80 as, in effect,
preparatory activities for the project now proposed. Faced with making use of
140 newly-recruited and hastily-trained extension assistants, the FAC project
stipulated that, in order to qualify for extension help and inputs, farmers
should put together 10 ha blocks of land for single-cropping, with 1 ha per
farmer. This policy was adopted on grounds that it would improve the effi-
ciency of the extension assistants, enabling them to supervise effective input
use and, moreover, would constitute a genuine expression of interest by
farmers. In its first two years, the project far exceeded its objectives,
reaching 6,600 ha of cowpeas in 1975/76 and 12,600 ha of cowpeas and 3,400 ha
of millet, that is 16,000 farmers, in 1976/ 77. Seasonal credit repayment
rates were 98% in 1975/76 on in-kind loans of CFAF 29 mil:Lion (US$130,000)
and, in 1976/77, 93% on CFAF 67 million (US$305,000). No accurate yield data
are available - the project had no monitoring capacity - but agronomists
concurred that yields were appreciably higher than on unimproved plots;
moreover, the impressive credit repayment rates, uncommon in Niger, attest
that farmers made money. Encouraged by the initial results, project manage-
ment set an objective of 20,000 ha for 1977/78, but the actual area, at 14,700
ha, was slightly lower than the year before. For 1978/79. project management
retained the objective of 20,000 ha, but the actual area fell further back to
8,600 ha.  The main reason for this decline lay in the manner in which the
blocks of land were constituted. In practice, such blocks could only be put
together in less densely-populated areas. There, the most common practice was
the 'leasing', by a group of 10 farmers, of cultivation rights on fallow land



- 15 -
controlled by a few usufructaries. As soon as and sometimes even before the
residual effect of phosphate applied to cowpeas became evident in the follow-
ing millet crop, the usufructaries generally reclaimed their land. Soon,
potential members of new block-farming groups desisted, for they had no
guarantee that they would reap the benefits of their investments. As a
curious but not immediately alarming development, there is now very little
evidence that the inputs and cultural practices introduced in the blo,cks are
being applied in block members' own fields. Indeed, the existing Pilot
Project is working in 1979 to promote adoption of improved techniques in
farmers' own fields. The project's cotton component was a failure, the
climatic conditions being too marginal, but the fattening component was
successful in that about 2,000 head were fattened each year with a credit
repayment rate of 97%.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Summary Description
3.01      The broad objectives of the proposed project are in accord with
Government's policies of increasing agricultural production and farm incomes
to improve the welfare and standard of living of the rural population. The
main specific objectives are to increase production of cereals, cowpeas,
groundnuts, livestock, and bottomland crops in ways that would reverse the
present decline in productivity. The project, to be implemented over five
years, would include:
(a) constructing a training center with facilities for 75 boarders,
providing courses for village extension workers and staff, intro-
ducing the Training and Visit system of agricultural extension,
and constructing and operating 24 rural extension centers;
(b) improving farming practices, increasing input use on about
150,000 ha of rainfed cereals, cowpeas and groundnuts, and
supplying about 6,400 donkey-traction units and about 1,800
ox-traction units;
(c) strengthening the farm input and implement supply system and
constructing 30 and improving 12 rural cooperative centers;
(d) improving vaccination coverage, delivery of drugs and feed
supplements, and animal husbandry practices for beef cattle
and work oxen;
(e) establishing a rural engineering unit to plan and supervise
construction of dispersed rural works and to execute improve-
ments on 200 ha of small-scale irrigation in bottomlands;



- 16 -
(f) conducting trials to test the introduction of new techniques
and farming practices, particularly with regard to soil
fertility;
(g) providing for a management structure with the required tech-
nical and administrative staff and logistical support, in-
cluding the capability for evaluating project progress and
providing guidelines for future projects.
B. Detailed Features
3.02      Rainfed Farming.  Of all farmers to be reached by the extension
service by year 5, about 30% are expected to adopt improved techniques on part
of their farms: Project intervention would therefore improve cultivation
practices on 76,000 ha farmed by some 16,700 smallholders who would adopt
improved manual cultivation techniques and on an additional 70,000 ha managed
by 8,200 farmers who would adopt improved animal traction techniques. Taking
account of variations in farming systems between the south and the north, and
the dallols and the plateau, the project area may be divided into three
agro-ecological zones (Map 14214); in a fourth area, the plateau country north
of a limit approximating the 550 mm isohyet, no attempt would be made to
improve rainfed farming. Details of inputs and estimated yields by zone are
at Annex 2, Table 1 and main project inputs are summarized at Table 3.1.
In rainfed farming the project's success would depend critically on the
establishment of an effective extension service and an adequate, timely, input
supply system.
3.03      Training and Extension.  Existing extension staff would be retrained
so that they would be able to operate through the Training and Visit (TV)
system of organized, closely-supervised agricultural extension. To this end,
a Training Center would be constructed near the village of Ayali, about 10 km
south of Dosso town, close to the tarred road to Gaya. The center would
primarily serve to give four-month courses, in the dry season, on farm manage-
ment and extension techniques to village extension workers (VEW). Beginning
in Year 2, two classes of 25 pupils each would enter the courses and 36 VEW
are expected to graduate successfully. The lower age limit for entry would be
18 years but almost all the trainees would be considerably older, the majority
having gained some experience with extension work under the existing Pilot
Project (para. 2.19). The minimum admission level would be elementary school
completion, preferably with a year or more of secondary education. The Center
would also train middle and upper level agricultural staff in the TV system,
as detailed in Working Paper 2. It would also be used for refresher courses
and to train enumerators for the project's Monitoring and Evaluation Section;
in addition, one-week programming and evaluation seminars would be held in
March, July and October of each year for the entire extension staff. Under
the supervision of a specialist in the TV system, courses and seminars would
be given by senior agricultural staff working in the project area and by staff
from the Kolo Agricultural Training Institute. A 40 ha farm would be attached
to the Center for practical training purposes and for applied research that
could not yet be tested on farmers' fields.

3.04      Operation of the Extension Service.  During the rainy season, the
VEW would make field visits on horseback to groups of contact farmers. In
each two-week period, each retrained VEW would visit eight groups of, on
average, eight contact farmers and work with them in their fields for a full
day. In the remaining four working days per fortnight, the VEWs would be
briefed for the next two-week period by their agricultural district officer.
Such briefings would be held in each district's rural extension center,
comprising a 64 m2 office/meeting room block, 90 m2 boarding facilities,
stables and a 60 m2 house for the agricultural district officer. Villages
of less than 100 inhabitants, or about 14 farms, would be grouped together for
extension visits, while each village of between 100 and 1,000 inhabitants
would be visited by a VEW for one full day per fortnight; larger villages
would have more than one group of contact farmers and be visited for more than
one day. Each agricultural district would have on average six VEWs and cover
48 villages. Sub-districts would be established wherever necessary to fit the
proposed structure of the extension service, i.e. if farm density justifies
it. Since each contact farmer would work with, on average, eight other
farmers each VEW would service 576 farmers, a relatively small number for a TV
system due to the large number of small villages. The TV system would be
introduced beginning in Year 2, in six agricultural districts per year, at the
locations and with the phasing, starting in the dallols and then moving up
onto the plateau, shown on Map 14215. By Year 5, 24 agricultural districts or
sub-districts would be fully operational and 83,000 farmers would have access
to extension advice. Each agricultural district officer would have a four-
wheel drive vehicle in order to supervise his six VEW for at least one full
day each during the 14-day cycle. He would be responsible for reviewing
progress with and briefing his VEWs, and he himself would receive training
from his administrative district officer at similarly regular intervals. The
content of the fortnightly extension programs and the briefing and training
meetings would be prepared by the project's specialists in training and
extension, and in agriculture.
3.05      Contact Farmers.  The choice of contact farmers is critical, yet
difficult, in that a balance has to be struck between social and technical
considerations. Contact farmers would therefore be chosen by their fellow
villagers after the VEWs would have explained the technical selection cri-
teria. Selection of contact farmers would be regularly reviewed by farmers
as well as the VEWs and the system would be flexible enough to allow contact
farmers to be changed. It would be the responsibility of contact farmers to
train their farmer groups at the same regular intervals as they are themselves
trained. Receipt of extension information first hand should be sufficient
remuneration for contact farmers' efforts.
3.06      Rates of Adoption of New Techniques.  It is difficult, even after
drawing on the experience of similar ongoing projects in northern Nigeria, to
be precise as to the numbers of farmers who will choose to adopt improved
techniques. It is nonetheless clear that many farmers would participate to
some degree, although the majority may not follow all the recommendations on
all their cultivated areas. For purposes of estimating project inputs and
outputs, it is assumed that an adoption rate of 40% is reached three years



- 19 -
after the first contact by VEWs, 10% in the first year, a conservative esti-
mate since less than the number of contact farmers alone (12%), 20% in the
second year and 10% in the third. It is further assumed that adoption of
improved manual farming techniques implies use of such techniques on only
two-thirds of the farm, to reflect the role of women in farm decision-making
(para 2.14) as well as labor constraints; by contrast, adoption of improved
animal traction farming techniques would permit an increase in harvested area
per farm. Actual adoption rates could vary between those postulated above
and, for instance, 80% adoption of one-third of the farm for those using
improved manual farming techniques.
3.07      Improved Farming Techniques.  Based on the production functions at
Annex 2, Table 1, the return per hectare and required labor input are speci-
fied at Annex 2, Table 2. Returns per farm and per labor-day at full devel-
opment for adopters of improved manual farming techniques and those adopting
improved animal traction techniques are shown at Annex 2, Table 3. The incre-
mental area to be improved under the project would reach 87,800 ha of cereals,
34,700 ha of cowpeas and 23,700 ha of groundnuts, up from a total improved
area in 1979 of 9,000 ha; details are at Annex 2, Table 4. It is estimated
that, in each agricultural district, two-thirds of adopters would use improved
manual farming techniques and that the incremental area cultivated with such
techniques in Year 5 would reach 76,500 ha (Annex 2, Table 5). The incre-
mental area cultivated with improved animal traction techniques would reach
69,700 ha in Year 5; of this figure, 55,000 ha would be cultivated with 6,400
donkey-traction units in the north and center of the project area and the
balance with 1,800 ox-traction units in the south. Although animal traction
improves seeding precision and plant density, no yield increases have been
attributed to these improvements. The main effect of animal traction, after
the initial demand for local transport would have been saturated, would be an
expansion in cropped area per farm, estimated at 1 ha in the north and 2 ha in
the center and south, in certain cases leading to a further reduction of
fallow land. In all cases, most of the production increase would be obtained
in the first year of adoption (60% of the increment) due to the immediate
effect of fertilizer; yields would increase by a further 20% per year to full
production in the third year after initial adoption. Annex 2, Table 7 shows
the growth of production of rainfed crops under these assumptions.
3.08      Input Supply.  Inputs, procured by the project through the operation
of a special account (para 3.16), would be delivered by suppliers to adminis-
trative district headquarters. Subsequent distribution to rural cooperative
centers where farmers would collect their inputs, would be organized by UNCC
as at present, and the project would provide 20 10-ton four-wheel drive trucks
for such distribution. A rural cooperative center, which together with a
rural extension center would constitute a farm service center, would consist
initially of one 200 m2 warehouse containing an office and sales counter, a
store for toxic materials as well as bulk storage space, and a 60 m2 house for
the warehouse manager. Such centers would be built in each agricultural dis-
trict or sub-district in line with the introduction of the TV system; where
not already existing, they would be built at the inception of the new extension



- 20 -
system, and a second warehouse of the same size would be built two years
later. Depending on demand for inputs within a district, the second storage
facility could be built in a different location. Depending on villagers'
interest, such facilities could be built by villagers in improved mud-brick
with cement, roofing, doors, frames and skilled labor supplied by the project.
The project would provide, in sum, 30 additional warehouses and staff houses
as well as minor improvements at 12 existing rural cooperative centers and, to
complete the existing network at administrative district level, a 250 m2
warehouse at Doutchi. Total storage capacity would allow for covered storage
of the Year 5 volume of improved seeds, triple superphosphate and urea; rock
phosphate would have been distributed to farmers and even applied to the
fields before the onset of the rainy season. The four-wheel drive vehicle
assigned to the rural extension center would be used by the warehouse manager,
who would be aided by two cooperative assistants equipped with horses, to
assess local demand for inputs before the agricultural season and, after the
harvest, to recover seasonal credits and to collect medium-term loan repay-
ments. Seasonal inputs would be distributed against cash or as credit in-kind
and animal traction equipment, repair units and sprayers would be distributed
against cash or through medium term credit (with 10 percent downpayment)
provided by CNCA. These loans would be repayable over four years and bear
interest at the prevailing rate for agricultural credit. This rate is cur-
rently 9.5 percent. Since annual inflation over the last three years was over
12 percent and is expected to remain at this level over the next. three years,
the current rate has therefore a hidden subsidy element. Incremental volumes
of the main inputs are summarized at Table 3.1; aggregate volumes would
increase substantially, notably for fertilizer from 500 tons pre-project to
13,000 tons of triple superphosphate and urea in Year 5 and thereafter, as
well as average annual application of 4,400 tons of rock phosphate after Year
5.
3.09      Livestock Development.  To improve vaccination coverage and access
to drugs and curative services, the project would provide some additional
facilities for the Livestock Department, namely one veterinary post at
Dioundiou, 12 vaccination yards, minor extension and rehabilitation of
offices, five four-wheel drive vehicles, a truck and some cooling equipment.
Existing staff would thereby become mobile throughout the year and the net-
work of field facilities, at which activities would be regularly supervised,
would be adequate to provide basic services throughout the project area.
Vaccination coverage for rinderpest and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
would be increased from 60% to 75%; smallstock vaccinations, which are cur-
rently negligible, would increase to 10% of the herd; and drug treatments
against internal parasites would reach 143,000 per year by the end of the
project. The existing credit scheme for steer fattening would be expanded by
an additional 800 loans per year and these animals, together with work oxen,
would receive first priority for anti-parasitic drugs and feed supplement
distribution. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that antiparasitic
drugs and feed supplements would be sold at prices sufficient to cover costs
of purchase, delivery and final distribution, and that proceeds from such
sales would be put into a revolving fund to be managed by the project.
Finally, in order to ensure better animal health control at the main livestock
market in the project area, and more hygienic slaughter facilities at the



- 21 -
abattoir outside Dosso town, the project would provide for fencing and
equipping the market at Mokko, and for expanding, covering and bringing piped
water to the Dosso abattoir. Government would provide the necessary financing
for operation and maintenance of the respective facilities.
3.10      Bottomland Development.  Dry-season cropping of vegetables, sugar
cane and root crops, which is presently practiced on 3,500 ha of bottomlands in
the dallols, would be increased by introducing improved inputs. At 18 selected
sites totalling 200 ha, initially identified by a Belgian aid mission (para
1.01) and where discussions have already been initiated with farmers, existing
small-scale irrigation would be improved with simple means. In the vicinity
of shallow hand-dug wells, hand tools would be loaned to farmers for digging
small irrigation channels and to construct field bunds to retain water after
the rainy season in locations suitable for rice cultivation. Around existing
artesian tubewells, the project would provide irrigation pipes on medium-term
loans to groups of about 20 farmers, after the farmers had provided all
unskilled labor required for construction of stilling basins. At both types
of locations, hand tools for cultivation would be made available for sale at
full cost prices. The Rural Engineering Department would provide farmers with
advice on how to lay out their irrigation system and construct and maintain
wells, canals and structures. Village extension workers would advise on
improved cultural practices and improved inputs. Improved irrigation of
bottomlands would be a pilot operation that would be monitored to provide data
for an extension under a possible follow-up project.
3.11      Applied Research.  The project's rainfed farming activities are
based on a few simple and substantially proven techniques (Section 5.A) that
could be successfully applied with an effective extension service and adequate,
timely, input supply. There is still a need for more research to identify
further improvements. Further, the fragile ecology of the more densely-
populated parts of the project area and possible problems arising from
sustained use of chemical fertilizers require that the natural environment,
particularly soils, be carefully monitored. An applied research unit would
therefore be set up concentrating on farming systems, fertilizer use, and soil
and water conservation. Most of the research work would be carried out on
farmers' fields. Farming systems research would include variety and inter-
cropping trials, the use of animal-drawn implements on intercropped fields,
and the introduction of animal-drawn chisel plows in combination with minimum
tillage practices. Fertilizer research would focus on monitoring mineral
deficiencies and possible remedies, and using rock phosphate in combination
with other fertilizers. A new technology for granulating rock phosphate
developed by IFDC would be tested under field conditions. Watershed manage-
ment research would be designed, with the assistance of consultants, to devise
simple systems of soil and water conservation in the dallols.
3.12      Buildings.  The Training Center would be the only substantial
building complex, with a gross area of 1,740 m2. New offices in Dosso town
would be built as extensions to existing buidings (270 m2 in total), with the
sole exception of the Rural Engineering Department for which a new building of



- 22 -
180 m2 would be constructed. In rural areas, although improved mud-brick
construction would entail an initial cost saving of 65%, all buildings with
the possible exception noted at para 3.08 would be in concrete, since main-
enance of dispersed rural works would be complex and probably costly, and
recruitment and retention of good staff requires attractive facilities. Farm
service centers, comprising a rural extension center (214 m2) and a rural
cooperative center (260 m2), would be built in each of the 24 agricultural
districts to the extent that existing buildings are inadequate. A second
storage facility would be built in the second year after introduction of the
TV system in each agricultural district. The surface area of all farm service
center buildings would be 12,900 m2.
3.13      Implementation Schedule.  The phasing of the main project activities
is illustrated at Chart 20154. Although newly-retrained village extension
workers would not begin to work nor project-supplied inputs be delivered until
April-May of 1981, there would be little slack between then and expected
effectiveness at end-1979. The critical activities would be the construction
of the Training Center, and the setting up of the Rural Engineering Department
and thereby the capacity to design, tender for, and supervise construction of
buildings for the first batch of farm service centers. Tender documents are
being prepared for the Training Center and upon Bank approval of documents
tendering would take place in early 1980. Procurement of inputs for delivery
for the 1981 agricultural season would also be initiated in early 1980,
depending on the results of an ongoing FAC study on the organization of input
-delivery.
C. Cost Estimates
3.14      Total project costs for the five-year implementation period 1980-84
are estimated at CFAF 8.64 billion (US$39.3 million) with a foreign exchange
component of 62%. Costs exclude direct taxes and import duties since these
would be waived. Base cost estimates reflect November 1979 prices, the
expected date of effectiveness. Physical contingencies include 10% for all
civil works and operating costs, but no provision for vehicles and equipment,
staff or inputs since specifications and quantities are clearly established;
the sole exceptions are the bottomland development and applied research
components for which 20% physical contingencies are provided for civil works,
operating costs and vehicles and equipment. Expected price increases are
compounded at the following annual rates: civil works 12%., local staff 10%,
all other items 6%; total expected price increases amount to 18% of total
project costs. Costs are detailed at Annex 2, Table 11 and summarized at
Table 3.2.

D. Proposed Financing
3.15      It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$20 million be made to
Government on standard terms to finance 51% of project costs. The French
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) would contribute US$4.5
million, the terms of the CCCE loan are to be defined between CCCE and
Government. ?ulfillment of conditions preceding initial disbursement of the
CCCE loan is a condition of efectiveness. The French Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation (FAC) would provide a grant of US$2.3 million equivalent.



- 24 -
Total external financing would be US$26.8 million, or 68% of total costs,
covering 100% of foreign exchange costs (US$24.4 million) and 18% of local
costs. Government would contribute US$7.2 million which would finance all
incremental local staff, 21% of civil works, 25% of vehicles and equipment,
and 71% of operating costs. The CNCA would contribute US$1.1 million which
would finance all loans for steer fattening. Beneficiaries would contribute
US$4.1 million, which would cover all costs of oxen and 16% of incremental
non-annual inputs. The financing plan is detailed at Annex 2, Tables 12 and
13, and summarized below:

Assurances were obtained at negotiations that, in addition to local
financing of 31% of project costs, Government would finance (a) existing
agricultural staff in the project area, including those presently financed
under the seed farm project (USAID), the existing Pilot Project, and livestock
fattening projects (FAC and FED) at the termination of such projects, and all
associated operating costs (about US$1 million per year), and (b) subsidies
on inputs which would increase from US$150,000 in 1979 to US$3.6 million
(US$2.7 million at constant prices) in 1984.
3.16      To ensure the efficient and timely execution of the project,
Government would establish three separate revolving funds to prefinance
project activities as follows: (i) a Farm Supplies Fund with CNCA for
prefinancing procurement of inputs and implements with an opening line of
credit of CFAF 320 million; (ii) a Special Project Account with the National
Development Bank (BDRN) for prefinancing all project operating costs with an
initial deposit of CFAF 200 million; and (iii) an account with the National
Treasury for prefinancing all project investments with an opening line of
Credit of CFAF 400 million. Establishment of these revolving funds with the
initial deposit and lines of credit is a condition of effectiveness of the IDA
Credit. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) the Farm Supplies



- 25 -
Fund would be augmented by Government with an additional line of credit
of CFAF 254 million (US$1.2 million) before September 30, 1981; (b)
subsidies on inputs distributed for the ongoing agricultural season would be
paid by Government into the same Farm Supplies Fund before September 30 of
each year, starting with 1980; (c) all receipts from farmers' cash purchases,
down payments on items acquired on medium term credit and all receipts from
seasonal and medium term loan repayments would be kept in the Farm Supplies
Fund, beginning on September 30, 1980; (d) any shortfall in seasonal and
medium term loan repayments and price inceases on non-incremental inputs would
be paid by Government into the Farm Supplies Fund by September 30 of each
year, beginning in 1980; (e) the Special Project Account (ii) would be re-
plenished at the beginning of each fiscal year, by an amount sufficient to
cover Government's contribution to the financing of the project for that year
on the basis of cash forecasts made by project management; and (f) the account
with the National Treasury (iii) would be re-established at the beginning of
each fiscal year through a line of credit granted on the basis of investment
budget forecasts made by project management.
E. Procurement and Disbursement
3.17      Procurement of civil works, inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) and
farm implements amounting to approximately US$22.0 million would be through
international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines in the
case of contracts over US$100,000. Competitive bidding in accordance with
local procedures, which are acceptable to IDA would be used for contracts
less than US$100,000 (approximately US$2.0 million). For contracts less
than US$30,000 competitive shopping would be employed (approximately US$1.0
million). For civil works local contractors would receive a 7.5% preference,
and domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference or the
applicable import duty whichever is lower. Internationally recruited staff
and consultants (estimated cost US$3.5 million) would be obtained following
procedures acceptable to IDA. Vehicles and equipment amounting to US$2.8
million, would be financed by FAC and CCCE according to their own regulations.
3.18      Inputs to be procured through the Farm Supplies Fund would include
both incremental and nonincremental quantities in one order for each input.
Such orders would be subject to the procurement procedures specified at
para. 3.17 even though, by Year 4 already, nonincremental quantities wholly
financed by seasonal loan repayments and Government prepayment of the subsidy
element would exceed project incremental quantities.
3.19      Applications for IDA credit withdrawal would be fully documented and
a schedule of disbursements is at Annex 2, Table 14. The proceeds of the IDA
credit would be disbursed as follows:



- 26 -
Category I:    Civil works, 40% of total expenditures (US$1.9 million);
Category II:   Expatriate staff and Consultants:  (a) 55% if furnished
by firms (US$1.0 million); (b) 100% if individuals
(US$0.37 million);
Category III:  Inputs and Implements:  100% of total expenditures on
incremental inputs and implements; US$12.7 million;
Category IV:   Refunding of the Project Preparation Advance (US$30,000); and
Category V:    Unallocated (US$4.0 million).
F. Accounts and Audit
3.20      The project's Commercial, Financial and Administrative Section would
keep records in accordance with sound accounting practices to reflect the
project's operational and financial position. All project accounts and
financial statements would be audited annually and the auditors would also
review the proposed accounting system early in 1980. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from Government that: (a) the Farm Supplies Fund,
the Special Project Account and the account with the National Treasury would
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (b) the report of the
independent auditors would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of
the project financial year; and (c) the report of the auditors would be of
such scope and in such detail as IDA may reasonably request, including a
statement as to whether or not IDA funds had been used for their intended
purpose.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Management
4.01      The project would include a range of activities that are presently
undertaken by the existing Pilot Project and some government agencies. The
existing project, administered by UNCC, often functions in parallel with
the provincial technical agencies. To avoid duplication of effort the new
project would be executed through the regular government technical agencies.
All proposed activities are, however, highly interdependent and successful
implementation requires that they become the responsibility of a single
Project Manager; he would also manage the continuation (and phasing out) of
activities undertaken by the existing project. The proposed project organi-
zation is shown on Chart 20156 and required responsibilities and qualifications
of key personnel are at Annex 1.



- 27 -
4.02      Under the Minister of Rural Development and the Provincial Governor,
the Project Manager would be responsible for planning, managing and super-
vising all project activities, including all project-financed staff. To
support him in this task, two sections would be attached to his office: (i)
the Commercial, Administrative and Financial Section (CAFS); and (ii) the
Technical Section (TS), responsible for monitoring and evaluation. For all
matters related to project execution the Provincial Officers for agriculture,
livestock, input supply (UNCC), credit supply (CNCA), rural engineering, and
applied research (INRAN) would report directly to the Project Manager. Rural
engineering would be a new Provincial Department to be created under the
project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that (a) the Project
Manager would introduce (i) by June 30, 1980, a project reporting system
including quarterly progress reports and (ii) by December 31, 1980, a project
monitoring system, both systems to be proposed by project management and
reviewed by IDA; (b) the Project Manager would prepare and forward by July 31
of each year his annual work program and budget simultaneously to Government
and IDA for approval; and (c) Government would, within six months of the
closing date, prepare a project completion report.
4.03      The Provincial Agricultural Department has a representative in each
of the five administrative districts who, in turn, have several agricultural
district chiefs under their orders. At present, agricultural districts
comprise one or more administrative cantons or sectors. Under the project the
boundaries of some of the agricultural districts would be redefined depending
-on the number of farms and the size of the villages. Each agricultural
district officer would have an average of six village extension workers (VEW)
under his orders. The existing Pilot Project, which has its own extension
workers, would gradually be phased out as extension workers are retrained
and incorporated in the new project. The two Subject Matter Specialists, in
training and extension, and in agriculture, have staff functions and would be
attached directly to the Provincial Agricultural Department. The Training
Center would also be under the Provincial Agricultural Officer, the Center's
Administrator with the assistance of the Farm Manager being responsible for
its operation.
4.04      The Provincial UNCC Representative also has a representative in each
administrative district responsible for all cooperative activities. Each
cooperative, one per agricultural district, would have a Warehouse Manager and
two Cooperative Assistants. Cooperatives are, in effect, assemblies of mutual
guarantee groups, and there would be one or more of these groups in each
village involved in the project.
4.05      The Provincial Livestock Department is organized as the other
provincial departments. Its representatives in each of the administrative
districts supervise the veterinary posts. The Provincial Rural Engineering
Department to be created would not be represented in the administrative
districts. The Rural Engineering Department would have two Sections:
(i) building design, contracts and supervision of construction; and
(ii) irrigation development in bottomlands. CNCA is only represented at the

provincial level and credit administration and recovery would continue to be
undertaken on its behalf by UNCC personnel at administrative district and
cooperative levels. All Provincial Officers as well as the Project Manager
would be members of the Provincial Technical Committee (para 2.07), as well as
the Sub-Committee for Rural Development; topics such as execution priorities
of feeder roads financed under 886-NIR would be decided by the latter.
B. Staffing
4.06      Key staff for the project include the Project Manager, Chief CAFS,
Chief TS, Provincial Agricultural Officer, Training Center Administrator, the
subject matter specialists in training and extension, and in agriculture, the
Applied Research Officer and Rural Engineering Officer. Only the Provincial
Agricultural Officer occupies an existing position. Of the new functions that
would be created both the Project Manager and the Training Center Administrator
would be Nigeriens. Because Niger is generally short of trained and experienced
staff with the capability of initiating and implementing a development program
such as described in this report, the six remaining functions would need to be
undertaken by expatriates. These positions would be filled through inter-
national recruitment with which APMU would assist. Appointment of the Chief
CAFS and the training and extension specialist is a condition of Credit
effectiveness.
4.07      Consultants would be recruited for:  (a) assisting the training and
extension specialist in starting up the Training Center; (b) assisting both
the agriculture specialist and the Applied Research Officer in setting up
applied research programs on farming systems focussing on crops and animal
traction; (c) assisting the Applied Research Officer in setting up programs
of fertilizer and soil conservation research on farmers' fields; (d) assisting
the chief TS in designing a monitoring and evaluation system that takes
account of the project's sociological implications; and (e) preparing a
possible follow-up project. Terms of reference for all consultants would be
subject to prior approval by IDA. The project would provide, in sum, for:
27 man-years of technical assistance at a unit cost of US$76,000, based on
recent APMU experience, and 28 man-months of consultant services at a unit
all-inclusive cost of US$9,500, of which US$7,150 for fees, US$1,500 for
living expenses, and US$850 for international travel. In addition, the Kolo
Agricultural Training Institute would supply part-time staff for the Training
Center to teach special subjects and assist in refresher courses.
4.08      For middle-level staff, namely agricultural district officers and
warehouse managers, the number of graduates to be expected from the Kolo
Agricultural Training Institute and the estimated number available for Dosso
Province were at the base of project design. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that local technical staff would be appointed according to the
schedule at Table 4.1. Appointment of VEWs would be a lesser problem since

the majority are already working in the area and project management would be
directly involved in their recruitment. Salaries of all Nigerien staff would
be paid directly by the State to ensure post-project continuity, with the
exception of allowances for local travel, supplies in-kind for horse mainten-
ance and, for the Project Manager, representation and responsibility; these
would be paid through the project account. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that Nigerien staff would be appointed for periods of at least
three years, that the qualifications and experience of all key personnel
mentioned in para 4.06 as well as their responsibilities (Annex 1) and all
consultants would be acceptable to IDA, and that the terms and conditions of
employment of internationally-recruited staff and all consultants would be
acceptable to IDA.
C. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.09      The lack of sound information on farming in the project area
(para 2.12) creates a particular need for an effective monitoring and evalua-
tion section. This would provide a dual service: to the Project Manager as
a data collection, analysis and advisory unit, and to Government and other
project financiers as a source of information for effective project supervi-
sion and impartial assessment of performance. The Section would undertake a
baseline survey in 1980 to provide precise information on farming systems and
pre-project productivity. Farming systems would be surveyed throughout
implementation, with priority given to crop yields in the more densely-popu-
lated parts of the project area. The Section would also maintain a central
data bank of basic planning and progress information, and would also keep a
detailed record of management decisions and reasons for any departures from
original proposals. Monitoring and evaluation programs would be designed in
close coordination with consultants and submitted to IDA fcr approval before
December 31, 1980.
V. TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
A. Rainfed Farming
5.01      Improvement of rainfed farming in the Sahelian Zone has in recent
years shown mixed results. The effects of the severe drought in the early
1970s are still felt in that farmers have become very prudent with the appli-
cation of new techniques that sometimes give results only in the less than
50% of the years that rainfall is above average. This has happened in areas
where fertilizer use and animal traction have been introduced more than 20
years ago, and where further improvements are now limited by the slow
progress of research to develop new technology (para. 1.12). In Dosso Pro-
vince, however, present fertilizer consumtion is still very low at about 500
tons per year, extension services and animal traction have been introduced only

recently: there are now only about 500 pairs of oxen. In this situation there
is still a real demand, generated by the impact of the Pilot Project (para.
2.19), for fertilizers and farm equipment and projects in Northern Nigeria
starting from a similarly low production level have already shown that input
demand can rise to levels expected for this project: at Funtua fertilizer use
rose from 6,000 tons to 17,000 tons in 2 years. Key technical coefficients are
summarized in Table 5.1. They reflect soil conditions, rainfall distribution
patterns, socio-economic constraints and labor availability. The proposed
technology is relatively inexpensive and adapted to the local circumstances.
Agronomic recommendations and yield projections are based on field results of
the existing Pilot Project (para. 2.19), relevant research, and experience
obtained in other projects under similar conditions of soils and climate. The
present low yields on deteriorated soils are estimated to be about half those
obtainable under the impact of fertilizer use and improved farming techniques.
As results of the project's applied research component become available, crop
recommendations would be modified. Although the project has for practical
reasons been calculated on the basis of single cropping, this is not an
agronomic recommendation. Intercropping, which is an existing practice, would
even be promoted as soon as agronomic recommendations resu:Lting from the
project's applied research program would become available. In this respect,
the design of the project has been kept flexible: a healthy response by farmers
to changes in prices would generally be supported by the extension service; a
major disease in groundnuts, such as the increasing danger of rust infesta-
tion, would result in larger areas grown in cowpeas or cereals without affect-
ing project outcome.
5.02      The proposed technology would involve better seed bed preparation,
the use of improved planting material (improved varieties and/or selected
seeds), increased planting density, appropriate fertilizer use, and timely
thinning and weeding. Improved seed of cowpeas (TN 88-63), millet (P3 Kolo),
sorghum (4d 8-2-3) and maize (P3 Kolo) would continue to be produced by the
Guecheme seed farm. New cowpea varieties developed at Samaru in Nigeria
(176B, 341, 335 and 355), and maize varieties from both Benin and Nigeria,
would be tested under the applied research program. Rainfed maize is rela-
tively new in the area, although it is grown extensively as a flood recession
crop and sometimes with supplemental irrigation during the dry season in the
bottomlands. Growing of rainfed maize would be introduced gradually, only
starting from the second year, allowing time to select the best varieties.
The last stage of seed multiplication would be done by farmers under contract,
a system that has proven to be successful in the area. The groundnut seed
stock (55-437 and 28-206) is replenished by obliging farmers to return 150% of
seed received, a system that works reasonably well. Under the project simple
techniques of seed selection of local varieties would be promoted. All seed
would be treated with fungicides prior to planting. Pyrethrin-based insecti-
cides would be used on cowpeas. Phosphate fertilizer would be given as a base
application before planting. Nitrogen on cereals would be applied at appro-
priate times in the growing cycle. On fields where no intercropping of
cereals and legumes is practiced, a simple rotation of pure stands of these
crops would be promoted. Cropping in blocks would not be promoted anymore and
farmers would be advised to apply improvements on their own fields.

5.03      Rock Phosphate.  Every four years 200 kg/ha of rock phosphate would
be applied on fields to be planted with cereals. Because of the relatively
low dose, an additional application of triple super phosphate (TSP) on legumes
has been foreseen. As technology becomes available to facilitate rock phos-
phate application, allowing larger doses and improving its solubility, TSP
usage could gradually be phased out. Rock phosphate application is important
for the project's success on the most impoverished soils because of its
beneficiary side effects from calcium and magnesium carbonates and trace
elements.
5.04      Animal Traction.  Although the introduction of draft animals is
relatively new in the area, there is a substantial demand for agricultural
equipment, in particular for carts. The equipment that would be used is
simple. On the sandy soils in the North, continuation of minimum tillage
practices would be promoted by using only a scarificator for soil preparation.
Without plowing less traction is needed and all implements could be drawn by
donkeys. However, where soils are too sandy for donkeys to pull loaded carts,
mono-ox traction would be introduced. On the heavier soils in the South,
simple plows would be used for soil preparation and farmers would have pairs
of oxen, also needed to lift groundnuts and ridge maize. To reduce tillage in
the South, ox-drawn chisel plows would be tested under the project.
5.05      Introducing one row seeders would allow farmers to plant in rows,
thus permitting mechanical cultivation. Using seeders would improve planting
precision and increase plant density. Since planting and weeding time are
bottlenecks for the use of farm labor, limiting the acreage cropped per
family, using animal traction would allow farmers to increase their cropped
acreage. Up to now, introducing animal traction often accompanied the elimina-
tion of intercropping as a farming practice because implements are designed
for use on pure stands only. Use of animal traction for seeding and cultiva-
tion on intercropped fields would therefore be tested under the project.
B. Livestock Development
5.06      Improvement of animal health control would entail annual vaccination
of 75% of the cattle population (up from 60%) against rinderpest and contagious
bovine pleuropneumonia during three years. Thereafter vaccinations against
rinderpest would be continued for animals aged between six and 18 months, with
a reserve stock of each vaccine, enough to cover 15% of the cattle population,
kept available to deal with outbreaks. An additional 15,000 vaccinations
against blackleg would be made for each of the first three years of the proj-
ect; thereafter a reserve stock would be maintained, as is already the prac-
tice for anthrax and pasteurellosis vaccines. For smallstock, anthrax vacci-
nations would be made in contaminated areas as an encirclement of outbreaks
and would reach about 10% of the smallstock population. A similar coverage is
envisaged for smallstock plague. Drug treatment would be carried out at the
end of the dry season and the end of the rainy season when staff is otherwise

underutilized. Cattle drugs would be provided for calves, work oxen and
steers for fattening; treatments against thread worms would be made throughout
the project area and against fluke worm only in the wetter areas, reaching
66,000 and 27,400 treatments respectively in the fifth year of the project.
Similar treatments for smallstock would reach 35,000 and 15,000 doses. To
reflect the production effect of vaccinations and drugs, a simplifying assump-
tion of an increase in cattle offtake from 11% to 12% by Year 5 has been
made.
5.07      Building on acquired experience, steer fattening loans would be made
to purchase animals at about 275 kg for resale after about six months at
375 kg. As a complement to the forecast doubling of legume hay production
(Table 5.2), the project would also operate a revolving fund for supply of
feed supplements to be sold at full cost to steer fattenerS as well as to oxen
operators.
C. Bottomland Development
5.08      The project would aim, first, to satisfy existing unsatisfied demand
for high-quality seeds and then to move into provision of insecticides and
fertilizer; only by the third year of the project would extension themes have
been defined sufficiently to try to promote improved inputs. Such caution is a
measure of the extent to which the bottomland development component of the
project would be a pilot exercise.
D. Production
5.09      Production by volume and value is summarized at Table 5.2.  To
separate out the population effect, "with" and "without" project production
are calculated with estimated 1982 population and cultivated area. The main
changes at full development would be an increase in output of cereals by
35,000 tons (16%), of cowpeas by 21,000 tons (59%) and of groundnuts by 8,000
tons (23%). Liveweight cattle output, including old oxen, would increase by
2,500 tons (26%) and bottomland crops by 900 tons (8%). Total crop and
livestock production would increase 21% by value.
VI. DEMAND. MARKETING AND PRICES. AND FINANCIAL IRESULTS
A. Demand
6.01      Whereas Niger has recently been a net importer of grain, current
prospects are that the country will soon revert to being about self-sufficient
in basic foodstuffs (para 1.04). The project area is already a small net

exporter of grains and legumes and, at full development in 1986, per capita
production would have increased by 20% for grains and by 40% for legumes. By
contrast neighboring Nigeria is increasingly a net food importer, and a number
of studies estimate that the national food deficit will continue to widen.
Disposal of project crop production at remunerative prices, in Nigeria if not
in Niger, should therefore present little difficulty. Groundnuts would, more-
over, be put onto the world market as soon as any regional surplus emerges.
Almost all the increased cattle production, about 1,000 tons of meat per year
by 1985, would be exported on the hoof to Nigeria where imports are presently
about 40,000 tons and satisfy 25% of domestic consumption.
B. Marketing
6.02      Although the parastatal crop marketing agencies together with a
handful of licensed traders are the sole authorized buyers from cooperatives,
private buyers with well-established networks are also operative throughout
the project area (para. 2.09). This competitive commercial structure is
thought to function reasonably efficiently and is likely to continue to do so,
particularly since Government recognizes the failure of its attempt, in the
early 1970s, to supplant rather than compete with the private sector. While
cattle marketing is handled exclusively by private traders, cattle exports are
regulated by a licensing system designed to facilitate reconstitution of the
national herd; in practice, although it is not entirely effective, this system
impedes movement of fattened animals as well as breeding stock. An assurance
was therefore obtained at negotiations that there would be no restrictions on
the marketing of fattened animals.
C. Prices
6.03      For the 1978/79 harvest, there are only small differences between
official prices paid by the parastatal marketing agencies, market prices
observed in the project area, and economic prices as calculated in Working
Paper 5, Table 1 for overseas-traded outputs, and Table 2 for outputs traded
with Northern Nigeria. In calculating project viability, the economic prices
for sorghum and maize are import parity prices and for groundnuts export
parity based on IBRD forecasts of 1985 world prices. Economic prices for
millet and cowpeas in 1985 are based on current prices in Northern Nigeria,
converted at the current unofficial exchange rate of CFAF 200: N 1.00,
augmented by the same proportionate real price change between 1979 and 1985 as
in the IBRD forecasts for sorghum (for millet) and groundnuts (for cowpeas).
Financial prices for farm budgets are based on observed 1978/79 market prices
and do not take account of projected real price increases of main outputs.
Liveweight cattle prices at markets in Dosso are currently very high, averag-
ing CFAF 180 (US$0.80) per kilo and exceeding CFAF 200 (US$0.90) per kilo for
fattened steers; but since it is unlikely that consumer preference for fresh



- 37 -
meat in Nigeria would decline and frozen meat imports would increase several-
fold, liveweight prices in Niger would not fall from their present, apparently
high levels because of competition from the world market. For purposes of
valuing project-related output of cattle, it is assumed that real border
prices ex-Niger will remain constant.
D. Financial Implications for Farmers
6.04      The financial impact of recommended practices in rainfed farming is
detailed in Annex 2, Tables 8-10 and summarized at Table 6.1 where returns are
shown per unit of labor and per unit of land using both subsidized and unsub-
sidized prices for inputs. At subsidized prices, farmers who adopt improved
manual cultivation practices could expect to increase net returns at full
productivity, in the third year after initial adoption, by 50%; adopters of
animal traction practices could expect their net returns to increase by 100%.
At unsubsidized prices, such returns would increase by about 30% and 60%
respectively. Achievement of these increased net returns requires, however,
an increase in labor input, by 15% for improved manual cultivation practices
and by 30%, 15% or zero for animal traction practices in the south, center
and north respectively. More indicative, then, of the potential of the
recommended practices is the increase of 30% in net return per man-day with
improved manual cultivation and between 60% and 100% with animal traction.
The farm budgets also reveal a clear case for some subsidy on inputs since the
net return at unsubsidized prices in the first year of adoption increases by
scarcely 10% with improved manual cultivation, and with animal traction,
actually falls; at prices as currently subsidized, however, such returns would
increase by 25% and by 24-48% respectively. The farm budgets do not take
account of the revenue that would arise from sale of old oxen after fattening,
nor of the 30% net return over six months that can be expected from steer
fattening, nor dry-season crop production. Average farm family income is
presently CFAF 185,000 (US$840) of which CFAF 150,000 (US$680) is from crops;
of this amount CFAF 133,000 (US$600) are obtained from crops to be improved
under the project. With the project the latter would increase to CFAF 196,000
(US$890) for adopters of improved manual cultivation practices or to CFAF
279,000 (US$1,270) for adopters of animal traction practices; the weighted
average income from project crops per farm family, including the non-adopters,
would be CFAF 157,000 (US$710). Thus, total average farm incomes with the
project would rise from CFAF 185,000 (US$840) to CFAF 209,000 (US$950).
E. Financial Implications for Government
6.05       There would be little increase in directly-generated revenue to
Government since, although cesses are levied on cowpeas and, in normal times,
groundnuts, Government price fixing has to take account of competition from
private traders; the scope for levying cesses is quite limited. Evidence from
ongoing agricultural development projects in northern Nigeria suggests, by
contrast, that considerable secondary economic activity develops in the

non-agricultural sectors, and that there is a marked increase in benefi-
ciaries' spending on consumer goods subject to indirect taxation. This
effect cannot yet be quantified with much accuracy but an estimate is included
in the Government cash flow at Annex 2, Table 15. That cash flow is negative
- a typical finding for such projects - and is in line with Niger's policy of
expanding investment in, as well as transferring income to, the rural sector.
The average annual deficit over the five-year project period would be CFAF 580
million (US$2.6 million) in current prices, of which Government's contribu-
tion to project costs would be only CFAF 330 million (US$1.5 million).
Thereafter the cash flow fluctuates and is positive in some years, depending
on inflows from medium-term loan repayments and outflows for new loans to
replace non-annual inputs; the average annual deficit in Years 11-20 would
be CFAF 274 million (US$1.2 million) in 1984 prices. These levels of net
expenditures are reasonable in the light of the resources, primarily from
uranium, expected to be available to Government.
VII. BENEFITS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Project Benefits
7.01      By introducing improved techniques and making necessary inputs
readily available, the project would increase production of cereals, cowpeas,
groundnuts, livestock and bottomland crops. Training, extension, input supply
and credit services would be made accessible to 80% of the 100,000 farm
families in the project area, of whom it is estimated that 25,000 would
adopt the recommended practices and thereby derive the income benefits des-
cribed at para. 6.04. In national terms, project incremental production
valued at 1985 border prices in 1979 terms would be worth US$21 million (up
from US$95 million) per year at full development, which would be reached in
1986; of this amount, cereals would constitute 45%, legumes and hay 43%,
livestock 10% and bottomland crops 2%.
7.02      Production increase would be achieved not only by applying an annual
average of 17,000 tons of fertilizer at full development but also by promoting
through the Training and Visit system improved cultivation methods. Since,
on the other hand, the mineral deficiencies that are already showing up
(para. 2.02) can be expected to become more acute with more intensive land
use, applied research would pay particular attention to such problems.
7.03      Although employment creation is not a primary objective of the
project, since labor supply at planting and weeding is already short, it would
nonetheless improve the intensity of employment by smoothing cycles in farm
operations. Despite the investments to be made in steer fattening and bottom-
land development, the project would not make any substantive change in dry-
season work opportunities; seasonal migration to the coast can therefore be

expected to continue at much the same rate as now although not for quite the
same duration. At full development, annual incremental on-farm employment
would be equivalent to only about 5,400 labor-years (up from 150,000 years),
much of it in the form of more intensive use of existing workers.
B. Economic Analysis
7.04      The following major assumptions are used:  (a) without project:  no
decrease in production due to declining fertility, it being assumed that
falling yields would be offset by the opening up of new land on the plateau;
(b) project life: 20 years with no residual values; (c) standard conversion
factor to express local costs in border prices: 0.92; (d) opportunity cost for
all incremental farm labor: the weighted average net return in unimproved
farming of CFAF 342 (US$1.56) per labor day; (e) no post-project phasing out
of training, extension, input delivery, or overhead costs; and (f) overhead
costs allocated to rainfed farming, livestock development and bottomland
development pro-rata with component-specific costs. Based on these assump-
tions, economic costs and benefits are detailed in Working Paper 5, summarized
in Table 6.1, and economic rates of return are as follows: rainfed farming
(89% of project costs): 23%; livestock development (9% of project costs);
40%: bottomland development (2% of project costs): 41%; total project:
25%.
7.05      Risks and Sensitivity Analysis.  The main risk is that the estimated
rate of adoption of recommended practices may not be attained due to poor
implementation of the Training and Visit system, and/or to poor organization
of input delivery, and/or to inadequate financing of nonincremental inputs,
and/or to possible farmer reluctance to increase their financial risks by
shifting from a traditionally extensive system of cultivation to more intensive
agriculture. However, agricultural development in Dosso Province is at a
preliminary stage (para. 5.01) and technical risks are minimal since the
recommended practices are simple and have been substantially tested, and
adopted, in the existing Pilot Project (para. 2.19) by 16,000 farmers on as
many hectares. To minimize remaining risks, experienced practitioners would
be employed to manage the Training and Visit system, input delivery would be
managed by the project's own Commercial, Administrative and Financial Section
through a special account, and Government's contribution to nonincremental
input financing would be payable in advance into the special account. These
measures apart, because inputs constitute about half of project costs, a
lower-than-anticipated adoption rate would entail significant cost savings.
Accordingly, analysis of crossover values (Table 7.1) shows that the adoption
rate could fall as much as one-third, from 146,000 ha to 96,000 ha, before the
economic rate of return to rainfed farming would fall to 10%. This finding
can be used to gauge the effects of other possible shortcomings; for urea on
cereals, for instance, which would not be applied unless fields were properly
weeded, the crossover value is 45% of the appraisal value - the cereal area
could fall from 88,000 ha to 40,000 ha or, in terms of urea, the volume
applied could fall from 6,700 tons to 3,000 tons. Other sensitivity tests
show that the project is quite insensitive to other possible adverse factors;
a catastrophic drought every five years, simulated by assutming zero incre-
mental benefits, would still yield an economic rate of return of about 9%.

a project reporting system including quarterly progress reports
and (ii) by December 31, 1980, a project monitoring system,
both systems to be proposed by project management and reviewed
by IDA; and (b) the Project Manager would prepare and forward
by July 31 of each year his annual work program and budget
simultaneously to Government and IDA for approval (para 4.02);
(ix) the qualifications and experience of all key personnel

(US$0.9 million) into the Special Project Account with BDRN,
had granted a CFAF 320 million (US$1.5 million) line of credit
with CNCA for the Farm Supplies Fund, and had granted a CFAF
400 million (US$1.8 million) line of credit with the National
Treasury (para 3.16);
(iii)  the Chief of the Commercial, Administrative and Financial
