MEMORANDUM AND RECOIMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMIENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A SECOND INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CONTROL PROJECT
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Brazil for US$50 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would have a maturity of 15 years, including three years
grace, at the Bank's standard variable rate, and would help finance
pollution control investments made by industry and strengthen federal and
state environmental protection agencies.
2.        Background.  Until recently, most of Brazil's industrial growth
took place with little concern for space planning, zoning or protection of
the environment. Legislation passed in the 1970s gave the Government, at
the federal and state levels, an adequate legal means to control industrial
pollution. Brazilian law gives the states primary responsibility for
enforcing the law through fines and penalties, but few states have agencies
with the capability to monitor pollution sources, design control strategies
and enforce the law. The first major attempt to control industrial
pollution began with the Sao Paulo Industrial Pollution Control Project
supported by the Bank (Loan No. 1822-BR) in 1980. Little demand for
financing materialized due to a combination of factors including: (i) a
severe economic recession; (ii) potential borrowers' perception that loan
processing requirements were onerous and collateral requirements were too
rigorous; and (iii) delays in municipal sewer construction. As a result,
US$24 million was cancelled from the loan account and changes Were made to
streamline subloan review procedures and make collateral requirements more
flexible. The introduction of the agreed changes combined with an
improvement in the local economy and stepped-up enforcement efforts by the
State of Sao Paulo (SPS) led to an acceleration in subloan applications.
The loan was committed by June 30, 1986 and was fully disbursed in December
1986. Recently the Government requested the Bank to continue its support
for this program in Sao Paulo, and to develop a program with SEMA, the
responsible national agency, to strengthen agencies at the state level
concerned with controlling industrial pollution. SEMA, which is part of
the Ministry of Urban Development and the Environment (MDU), until recently
concentrated its efforts mostly on public relations activities to increase
awareness of environmental issues. Its new management, adopting a much
more activist approach in line with Government's heightened concern about
environmental problems, intends to define, on a national basis, the
environmental impact of industrial pollution and the strategies to correct
it, and to support and strengthen state agencies' capacity to enforce the
pollution control legislation.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project has two primary
objectives. First, it would seek to improve public health by further
reducing industrial air, water and solid waste pollution within the State
of Sao Paulo. Secondly, the project would seek to strengthen SEMA and the
state environmental protection agencies (SEPAs) by developing agencies'



- 2 -
operational and technical capabillties to design and implement integrated
long-term industrial pollution control strategies and programs within their
jurisdictions. An additional ohjective would be to have the Government
develop appropriate incentives for pollution control investments. The
absence of any incentives at the federal level has led SPS to provide
incentives at the state level by subsidizing the interest rate on these
investments. While this form of incentive is justified, especially for
retrofitting existing plants, given the indirect benefits associated with
these investments, more transparent incentives would be preferable and
these would be defined as part of the project.
4.        Project Description.  The Federative Republic (FR) would be the
borrower, acting through the national development bank (BNDES) as its
financial agent. The project would be divided into two parts. Part A
would include: (i) subprojects by industrial enterprises to reduce all
types of industrial pollution in Sao Paulo and (ii) institutional
strengthening of CETESB, the SEPA of Sao Paulo State. Part A (ii) would be
administered by CETESB with consultants' assistance, and would consist of:
(a) the purchase of specialized monitoring and laboratory analysis
equipment; (b) applied research and studies in fields such as biological
and toxic treatment, hazardous risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis;
and (c) training of staff from industry and CETESB in various pollution
control subjects. The state's development bank, BADESP, would act as the
state's financial agent and as administrator of the revolving fund (PROCOP)
established under the first proJect and through which Bank loan funds would
be channeled for Part A of the project. Part B of the project would
include institutional strengthening for SEMA and the SEPAs, other than
CETESB. It would be administered by SEMA with consultants' assistance and
would include (a) the purchase of equipment for laboratories and monitoring
programs; (b) diagnostic studies to determine the nature and extent of
industrial pollution problems in states other than Sao Paulo, with
recommendations for control strategies; (c) an assessment of local training
resources; and (d) training programs to develop the capabilities of SEMA
and SEPAs, other than CETESB, in pollution control. It would also include
SEMA's development of appropriate incentives for investments in pollution
control. The estimated total project cost is US$100 million equivalent.
Pollution control subprojects under Part A would amount to US$88.8 million
equivalent, and technical assistance (TA) for Parts A and B would amount to
US$11.2 million equivalent. Retroactive financing for subprojects under
Part A would not exceed US$4 million and under Part B, $200,000. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6673-BR, dated May, 12, 1987 will be distributed
separately.
5.        Rationale for IBRD Involvement.  Given the advances made by
Brazil's industrial sector, the government has been giving increasing
priority to correcting some of the adverse effects of this development on
the environment. The Bank similarly has begun complementing its lending
for industrial development with projects designed to address specifically
the need for pollution control. The project would build on the lessons



- 3 -
learned under the Sao Paulo Industrial Pollution Control Project. These
include the need for a substantial pipeline of subprojects before loan
approval, improved coordination between CETESB and the Sao Paulo water
authority (SABESP), as well as improvements In loan processing and
collateral arrangements some of which had already been adopted in 1984 (see
para. 2 above), and removal of investments involving process change from
eligibility for the incentive interest rate. The Bank would be the only
external lender directly supporting the government's efforts in industrial
pollution control.
6.        Agreed Actions.  (a)(i) The credit component of the project (Part
A) would have a real rate of interest not lower than 9.5%, which is the
BNDES long-term lending rate for large borrowers; (ii) Subprojects
involving direct treatment solutions (as opposed to process changes which
have financial benefits) for plants constructed prior to enforcement of
pollution control strategies (April 1980 for particulate matter in the
Greater Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area or December 31, 1986 for other
pollutants) would be entitled to an incentive interest rate not lower than
6% in real terms; and (iii) The credit component would adopt the BNDES
method (the OTN index) of adjusting monthly for inflation the principal of
subloans, and the Bank would have the right to suspend commitments for the
credit component if the OTN index does not keep up with inflation as
measured by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (a private educational and
research institute); (b) BADESP would take 25% of the credit risk on
subloans in order to insure a thorough assessment of the creditworthiness
of sub-borrowers; (c) SEMA, with the help of consultants, would complete
diagnostic studies of industrial pollution problems in approximately 12
states by December 1, 1989; (d) a government decision on appropriate
national incentives for industrial pollution control investments would be
made (after exchanging views with the rank) no later than Dec. 31, 1988;
(e) procurement procedures for the credit component (Part A), would include
international shopping procedures for contracts involving equipment greater
than US$2 million; otherwise procurement would be by the normal procedures
of the investing enterprise which would ensure a reasonable degree of
competition; since civil works contracts would not be procured under ICB,
such contracts which are large enough potentially to attract international
bidders, i.e. those over US$5 million, would be ineligible for Bank
financing; (f) procurement procedures for SEMA and CETESB would include ICB
for purchases of equipment which exceed US$300,000 and are not proprietary
in nature; below this limit local government procurerL.nt procedures
acceptable to the Bank would be used; and (g) the SABESP-CETESB
coordination agreement will be strengthened to provide for timely exchange
of information on proposed water pollution subprojects to assure that
cost-effective control solutions are agreed between these agencies and the
enterprise concerned.
7.        Justification and risk.  The health, environmental and indirect
economic benefits (including increase in land value) are not readily
quantifiable, but they should be substantial, since about 65% of the
investments by enterprises are expected to occur in the Cubatao industrial
center, considered by SEMA to be the most heavily polltted area in Brazil.
The project would improve the health and living conditions of lower income



groups, since they tend to live in areas closest to the worst sources of
pollution. The risk of insufficient demand from enterprises for financing
is minimal since BADESP has a pipeline of subprojects for financing equal
to about 70 of the loan. Both BADESP and CETFSB have developed a project
team with proven capabilities to Implement Part A of the project. The
capabilities of SEMA, and the SEPAs other than Sao Paulo, to implement Part
B of the project are limited, so that SEMA would hire the services of an
agency acceptable to the Bank to help implement this program.
8.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
