INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DFVELOP'EN'T
REPORT AND RECfNYENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXEICUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPILAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A HIGHWAYS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Democratic and Popular Republic of Alceria for the equtivalent of USS18.5
million to help finance a highwavs project. The loan would have a term of 25
years, including five years of grace, with interest at seven and a quarter per--
cent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Algeria" (155-AL) is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
It is based on the findings of a mission to Algeria in November/December, 1972.
The next economic mission is scheduled to visit Algeria during the spring of
1974. A Cotuntry Data Sheet is attached in Annex I.
3.        Algeria emerged from the long struggle for independence, attained in
1962, in a state of economic, social and administrative turmoil. Following a
period of adjustment, the Government has succeeded in creating political sta-
bility while pursuing a strategy of pragmatic and vigorous economic develop-
ment through centralized control of the economy. Two principal constraints to
development - the institutional vacuum and the lack of technical and profes-
sional staff following the exodus of about 900,000 inhabitants of European
origin from the country after independence - have been systematically tackled,
and substantial progress has been made. Industrialization and the exploita-
tion of oil reserves have played the primary role in development. The agri-
cultural sector is still marked by imbalances deriving from changes in market
patterns since independence. Urban and rural unemployment is high while, on
the other hand, there is an acute shortage of skilled manpo'jer. Policies of
financial austerity and equalizing distribution of income have been pursued,
but disparities of income still exist between regions, mainly reflecting
differences in resources and the level of economic development.
4.        The economic policies of the Government reflect its basic social and
political aims of economic independence, rapid growth through industrializa-
tion, and a narrowing of income disparities. A broad policy of nationaliza-
tion has been implemented with consistency, and nearly all foreign-owned enter-
prises have been brought under Algerian control. Foreign capital is welcomed
in the form of mediurn and long-term loans, but not in the form of direct in-
vestment. However, joint ventures are accepted in specific cases, e.g. as
part of economic cooperation with other Maghreb countries or when they offer



- 2 -
technological know-how or outlets to foreign markets. A major share of
Algeria's investment effort has gone into basic industry, notably hydro-
carbons, cast iron, steel and chemicals, and into education. To narrow in-
come disparities, the Government has established wage ceilings and minimum
wage policies. Generous social security, free education, government trans-
fers in the form of veteran's pensions and price subsidies, integrated re-
gional development programs, and an agrarian reform have also aimed at im-
proving income distribution.
5.        Economic growth since 1965 (at about 7 percent per vear) has been
largely determined by a rising level of oil exports and by the rapid growth
of manufacturing industry and construction, which were stimulated by an accel-
erated rate of public investment. The share of private investments in total
fixed capital formation declined from 45 percent in 1966 to less than 5
percent in 1972. The ratio of investment to GDP, which was about 20 percent
in the first five years after independence, attained 40 percent in 1972, and
is likely to increase in 1973. Industrialization and the exploitation of
oil reserves in the last two years have changed the composition of GDP. In
1972, petroleum accounted for about 18 percent of GDP, 80 percent of export
earnings and 35 percent of government revenues. The share of non-oil industry
in GDP was 13 percent and of agriculture, 9 percent.
6.        Algerian pro-_ctions show that an overall growth rate of 8 percent
per annum during the 1974-1980 period is feasible. The main growth rates ac-
cording to Bank projections are 7 percent for hydrocarbons, 11 percent for
all other industry while agricultural production may grow by only 2 percent,
partly because of the slow effects of land reform and vineyard conversion.
Annual investment may go up from DA 11 billion in 1972 to DA 16 billion in
1975 and DA 19 billion at the end of the decade. The current Four-Year
Plan (1970-1973) has put particular emphasis on the construction of heavy
industries, but during the seventies there will be a progressive shift in
favor of agriculture, consumer oriented industries, housing and infrastructure.
Education will continue to play an important role. The growth pattern would
allow for 3.5 percent annual increase in per capita consumption.
7.        The investment drive of the last five years created a resource gap
which built up rapidly to about S630 million in 1972, but the current account
deficit was only $350 million due mainly to workers' remittances, and reduced
transfers out of the country by oil companies. Initially, Algeria drew down
its reserves, but in 1970 it began to increase its external borrowing as the
need for external capital became more pressing and as its standing on the in-
ternational capital markets improved. Large gross capital inflows, mainly
in the form of financial and supplier credits, allowed Algeria to meet the
deficit and increase its gross reserves from $340 million at the end of 1970
to $493 million by the end of 1972, equivalent to about three months of 1972
imports. At the end of 1972 total debt outstanding amounted to $2.7 billion
including $1.5 billion already disbursed.
8.        The rapid expansion of gross capital inflows was accomplished by bor-
rowing at conventional terms. Debt service was $199 million in 1972, equiva-
lent to 12 percent of exports of goods and services (including workers'
remittances). Preliminary calculations based on the debt outstanding at the



-3-
end of 1972 indicate that the debt service ratio could rise to about 17 percent
in 1973. Moreover, since January 1, 1973, Algeria has contracted about $1.2
billion of additional long-term borrowings, mostly to finance investments
related to gas export projects. The effect of these most recent borrowings
on Algeria's debt service in 1973 will depend on the pace at which these .unds
will be drawn down. Future debt service will largely depend on the development
of oil prices and exports on the one hand, and on the other hand, on the level
of investments, particularly for gas export schemes. Assuming a sustained
high level of investments and domestic savings and a moderate rise in the
value of oil exports, Algeria should seek new debt on better than commercial
terms if it is to maintain a debt service ratio of around 20 percent in the
early 1980's. Higher oil prices or exports would correspondingly reduce the
debt burden or support borrowing on harder terms. Within this framework
Algeria is capable of servicing substantial additional borrowing in the future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
9.        Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans in Algeria made
in earlier years. All three projects have been successfully completed. Fol-
lowing the hiatus in Bank lending to Algeria commencing in 1964, it has taken
a long time to establish close day-to-day relations with Algeria, one result
of which is the two proposals I am presenting today.
10.       In the period since independence, the Bank's relations with Algeria
have been affected by two matters. The first was the inability for some time
to agree on the relative priorities of sectors for lending and on the way in
which complex industrial projects should be implemented. These issues have
now been resolved. The second and more difficult matter was the compensation
issue which arose as a result of the nationalization of foreign-owned banks,
and insurance, commercial, manufacturing, mining and oil companies. National-
ization took place over a period of several years and in several forms, and
the total value of foreign property affected has never been determined in
any definite form. Large numbers of unsettled compensation claims ensued.
11.       During the 1970 Annual Meeting, I indicated to the Algerian delega-
tion that the Bank staff would help identify and prepare projects suitable
for Bank lending, and that I would submit loan proposals to the Executive
Directors when I was satisfied that the Algerian authorities had undertaken
reasonable efforts towards settlement of the compensation claims. In view
of the fact that settlements have been reached in the banking, insurance
and petroleum sectors and that the Bank has been informed that new discus-
sions with the claimants on the bulk of the remaining industrial claims are
now underway, I consider that sufficiently encouraging steps have been taken
in this matter for the Executive Directors to proceed now with the considera-
tion of the two projects that have been appraised, namely the proposed High-
ways project and the Education project which are presented simultaneously.
12.       Proposed lending to Algeria in FY1973 would amount to $24.5 million
for the above projects. In subsequent years, lending is expected to increase
to a level in line with Algeria's absorptive capacity and development efforts.
Initially, Bank lending is expected to concentrate on education - a sector



- 4 -
with a high priority - and on infrastructure, which is increasingly a con-
straint to the development of productive sectors. Appraisals are scheduled
for projects particularly in education, railways, ports and power. Later
the Bank also hopes to assist industrial and agricultural development. After
the adoption of the 1974-77 Development Plan, now being prepared, it should
be possible to have discussions with the Algerian authorities to better define
the thrust of future Bank operations.
13.       In 1971, Bank project identification missions visited Algeria and
identified a number of projects which form the bulk of the present project
pipeline. Recently, the Bank provided technical assistance to Algeria to
help improve the collection of external debt statistics and the monitoring,
by the Ministry of Finance, of external borrowings contracted by other gov-
ernment or private agencies. For the future, technical assistance will be
mainly through project and possibly sector missions.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
14.       At the time of independence in 1962, Algeria already had a well-devel-
oped transport system particularly in the northern part of the country and
excess capacity appear-. because traffic growth slowed down initially after
independence. Since then, new investments were made mainly in connection with
new industrial projects, particularly in the gas and oil sectors, but mainten-
ance of existing facilities declined. Recently, however, the Government re-
emphasized transport demand following the development of the economy, and this
is expected to be reflected in the 1974-77 Development Plan presently under
preparation.
15.       Highways:   Algeria has an extensive highways network (about 79,000 km
of classified roads), nearly half of which is paved. Nearly 70 percent of to-
tal land transport volume is carried by road. Traffic growth, which was over
10 percent per year in 1968-1970, is expected to level off to about 8 percent
per year during the next 1974-1977 Plan. On avera,ge, vehicle density remains
relatively low, but traffic is largely concentrated in the coastal area, re-
flecting the location of major industries.
16.       The road freight and passenger transport is controlled by two semi-
independent state enterprises, Societe Nationale des Transports Routiers
which has a monopoly for public road transport of freight, and Societe Nation-
ale de Transport de Voyageurs which has a similar monopoly for passengers.
The capacity of both companies should be increased.
17.       Financing of transport infrastructure is provided by the Government,
mostly through the central budget. Regional and local authorities contribute
to maintenance of regional and local roads. The various road users charges
yield revenues about four times larger than expenditures on roads, leaving a
su'- itantial contribution to the central budget.
18.       The (k,vernment is now seeking to improve transport investment planning
and coordination through a study of the transport sector. With respect to



highways, this will be achieved by the creation of a planning unit in the De-
sign office of the Ministry of Public Works and by coordinating the various
studies under the project. Similarly reinforcement of the engineering staff
and laboratories equipment is being sought. Finally, a program of acquisition
of modern maintenance vehicles and new laboratory equipment by the Government
is being considered.
19.       Railways:  Algerian railways comprise about 4,000 km of wide and
narrow tracks. Bulk commodities amount to 90 percent of total freight volume
of which about 50 to 60 percent is for phosphates and iron ore in the East.
Rail-road competition is thus not a critical issue and the railways are ex-
pected to continue to concentrate on the transport of raw materials and basic
commodities over relatively long distances.   Track rehabilitation and new
equipment are needed and the Government has asked the railways to prepare
an investment program. A project comprising the first phase of the program
has been submitted for Bank consideration and was discussed by a mission in
February 1973. Its preparation is being completed and it could form the
basis for a possible Bank loan.
20.       Ports:  Algeria has six major ports in which recent investments
have been mainly for petroleum and ore traffic. With recent traffic increases
the ports of Algiers and Annaba have become congested, and various measures
to improve port efficiency are being considered by the Government, including
new port facilities under construction or planned in the ports of Skikda,
Annaba, and Arzew in connection with gas, oil, and phosphate exports and a
steel mill development. The Government has asked the Bank for assistance
for a major expansion of the port of Arzew mainly for the export of liquefied
natural gas.
21.       Piplines:   The discovery of considerable reserves of oil and gas
and the development of oil exports from the Sahara has induced the creation
of an extensive network of pipelines from the fields to the export harbors
of Arzew, Bejaia and Skikda. Additional pipelines are to be constructed
primarily toward Arzew and Skikda to meet transport requirements generated
by contracts currently under negotiation for massive exports of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) to the United States and Western Europe. A $20.5 million
Bank loan (378-AL) was made in 1964 to help finance the first LNG plant in
Arzew.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Project Algeria" (No. 94a-
AL dated May 29, 1973) is being distributed separately. A loan and project
summary is attached as Annex III. The proposed Highway Project was appraised
in September/October 1972. Negotiations were held in Washington from April 24
to Mlay 2, 1973. The Borrower was represented by Mr. Aioufi, Secretary General,



- 6 -
Ministry of Finance; Mr. Abdelkader Bousselham, Minister Plenipotentiary;
Mr. Zerouta, Adviser to the Minister of Finance; Mr. Chabane, Technical
Adviser to the Minister of Finance; and Mr. Kortbi, Director of Infrastruc-
ture, Ministry of Public Works.
:13.      The project is aimed at correcting some immediate shortcomings in
the highway network and at preparing a road investment program which would
adequately support Algeria's economic development. It consists of the im-
provenent of some 84 km of priority roads in the high density traffic cor-
ridor connecting AlgeriaTs centers of industry, various feasibility studies
for nearly 1500 km of roads, additional economic studies for the Trans-
Sahara road from Algiers to Niger and tali, a road maintenance study, the
purchase of maintenance vehicles and laboratory equipment and technical as-
sistance for the establishment of a highway planning office,    The relatively
high studies component (about 17 percent of total cost) corresponds to the
priority expected to be given to transport infrastructure in the 1974-1977
Development Plan.
24.       Improvement Works:   The Governmernt has selected sections of national
and regional roads to be improved on the basis of the 1971-197-2 traffic count-
ing survey and the prospective importance of the various sections for economic
growtlh.  Major works are near Algiers, in the industrial triang,le Constantine-
Annaba-Skikda and near Ei Asnam, an important agricultural center southwest of
Algiers.  Most of the benefits of improvement works will accrue to the economy
at large. Feasibility studies were prepared by consultants and detailed engi-
neering by the Ministry of Public Works.   Because of the urgency of improve-
mnent works, construction of eight sections has already startedI and bids for
two additional sections have been received; contracts have been and will be
awvarded to the lowest evaluated bidder after international competitive bidding.
25.       Studies for Existing Roads:   The project includes consultants' fea-
sibility studies to cover a priority list of about 1 ,000 km of existing na-
tional road sections to be improved. The Government will review the studies
with the Bank before starting detailed engineering for an improvement program.
In addition the project includes a feasibility study for an expressway between
Oran and Arzew which may soon become necessary.
26.       Studies for New Roads:   The project also includes consultants'
feasibility studies to cover construction of a priority list of new national
roads and by-passes totalling about 300 km, and studies for two expressways
in the east and southwest of Algiers of which one for the Algiers East ex-
pressway is already underway, and economtic studies for the proposed Trans-
Sahara road. The Government will review with the Bank the content of the
studies and the selection of sections for detailed engineering. The UNDP
is presently financing detailed engineering of part of the Trans-Sahara road
and since it had no further funds, additional economic studies to up-date
the original feasibility study made in 1968, have been included in the proj-
ect on the Government's request. The Government has asked the Bank to con-
sider in due course financing of the construction of one or more sections
of the road.



-7-
27.       Maintenance.   The project includes a highway maintenance study by
consultants to advise the Government on appropriate budget allocations and
improvements in the organization and operation of highway maintenace. Dur-
ing negotiations adequate assurances were obtained regarding its review and
implementation, and regarding the adoption of sound maintenance practices. The
project covers the replacement of maintenance vehicles over 10 years old,
the creation of an initial stock of spare parts for existing and new vehi-
cles, and equipment for the laboratories of the provincial offices of the
Ministry of Public Works. Additional vehicles and equipment will be iden-
tified under the maintenance study.
23.       Techical assistance:   To improve highiway planning and project eval-
uation and to coordinate highway plans with urban plans of the Directorate
for Planning and Urban Development, the Directorate for Infrastructure of the
Ministry of Public Works has asked for help in establishing a small highway
planning office to be attached to its Design Office for Infrastructure.
Three experts from a consulting firm will be employed to establish the office,
initiate operations and train Algerian counterparts. The experts also will
ensure adequate coordination of che various studies to be carried out under
thie project.
29.       Execution of the Project:   The project will be carried out by the
Directorate for Infrastructure in the Ministry of Public Works. The studies
will be prepared by consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1976. Im-
provement works began in mid-1972 and will be completed by mid-1975.
Contracts for maintenance vehicles and laboratory equipment will provide
for one third of the equipment to he delivered in 1973 and the remainder
in 1974.
30.       Benefits: The benefits from. improvement works are estimated to
yield a 35 percent overall Economic Return, with rates for individual sec-
tions varying from 15 to over 50 percent. Replacemenit of overage vehicles
are justified by savings in repair and fuel costs and are essential for more
efficient maintenance. The preinvestment and maintenance studies, the new
laboratory equipment and the technical assistance will help the &overnment
improve project preparation and execution as well as road maintenance and
planning and provide additional on-the-job training for the counterparts
to be appointed to the consultants. The project will help the Government
redress the lag in highway development in recent years, which is essential
if development of the road network is to keep pace with the increase in road
transport demand and the expected growth of the economy.
31.       Financing:   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$33.5
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$18.5 million
equivalent. These estimates include a continigency allowance based on a
5 percent cumulative annual price increase and a 10 percent increase for
physical overruns on all project elements. Detailed cost estimates have
been made for each project item and are summarized in Annex III. The pro-
posed loan of US$18.5 million equivalent would cover the foreign exchange
cost of the project, and the Covernment will cover the local cost.



- 8 -
32.       Procurement:   Contracts for works on four sections were awarded
in mid-1972 on conditions satisfactory to the Bank after international com-
petitive bidding. Due to the urgency of improvement works, construction
started in the second half of 1972 and is adequately supervised by the Min-
istry of Public Works. Thereafter it received bids on six additional sec-
tions under international competitive bidding; work on four of these sec-
tions has started early in 1973 and the remaining two sections are scheduled
to start by mid-1973. The expressway feasibility study started in March 1972,
and the consultants' recommendations will be available in the second half of
1973.   The proposed loan includes an amount of $1.8 million for the retro-
active financing of the works on the sections on which construction has
started and the feasibility study already under way.
33.       Further contracts for civil works and equipment under the project
will be awarded after international competitive bidding and according to the
Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement", including the provision of a margin
of preference for local manufacturers of 15 percent or the applicable duty,
whichever is lower. Imports of equipment and vehicles are not subject to
preferential tariffs since the preferential duties applying to EEC countries
have been abolished as of January 1, 1973.
34.       Disbursement:   Disbursement will be made on the basis of 40 percent
of expenditures for imp3ovement works, the foreign cost of consulting serv-
ices, and the CIF cost (Algiers) of the maintenance vehicles, spare parts
and laboratory equipment.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Democratic and Popular Republic
of Algeria and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreerment and the text of a Resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft Agreement conforms to the normal pattern
for loans for highway projects.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
