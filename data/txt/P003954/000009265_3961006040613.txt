MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION ANW DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A JAVA IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT AND WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.         The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$165.7 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance a
Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Resources Management Project.
2.         Water Resources and Irrigation Backpround.  Java contains
60 percent of the Indonesian population (186 million), the bulk of its
industry and over half of irrigated agriculture (60 percent of the total 5.2
million irrigated ha), but only 7-8 percent of its land and water resources.
Java faces serious land and water constraints to sustained economic growth.
Many river basins face critical water shortages in the dry season, especially
near the major urban centers. River pollution, mainly from human and
industrial wastes, is serious on many rivers and reduces usable water.
Without proper development and management of water resources, requirements
that compete with irrigation, coupled with neglected maintenance of existing
schemes ir the absence of new investment, could undermine Indonesia's food
self-sufficiency, and the vitality of the Javanese rural economy.
3.         A tou..al of 3.2 million ha on Java are irrigated, of which 2.7
million ha are publicly managed. The bulk of the larger schemes were
rehabilitated earlier. About 1.1. million ha, including 700,000 ha on small
systems, remain unimproved and need rehabilitation or minor upgrading which
would increase water availability and prevent siltation, leakage, and
deterioration.
4.         Water Resources Manakement Issues.  Regulations and a legal
framework exist in Indonesia to guide integrated water resources management.
The most important among them are a Ministry of Public Works (MPW) regulation
for management within designated river basin territories (15 in Java) and a
regulation on water allocation and licensing. Fundamental policy and
institutional adjustments are needed to fully implement effective water
resources management. The majority of river basin operations remain
rudimentary at best, deficient in monitoring and communication facilities, and
deficient in hydrological data.
5.         Past Experience and Lessons Learned.  The Bank has heavily
supported water related projects in Indonesia, e.g. irrigation operations
including swamp reclamation, flood control and a multi-purpose dam; large
hydro-electric projects; and a number of water supply and irban.drainage
projects. Irrigation has absorbed a major part (27 operations with loans of
some US$2.0 billion) of Bank lending to Indonesia for agriculture. The
outcome of Bank-supported completed irrigation projects in Java have all been
successful, in contrast to generally poor results of irrigation projects in
the outer islands. Experience from these projects highlights the need for an
integrated approach to water resources manag,ement to relieve the growing
problems of water availability and quality especially near the main urban



centers. Experience also underscores the importance of rehabilitation coupled
with correcting Operation and Maintenance (O&M) deficiencies resulting from
financial constraints and low cost recovery. The design of the proposed
project draws upon these lessons.
6.         GOI Water Resources and Irrigation Strategv.  An international
water resources seminar held in November 1992 initiated serious deliberations
within GOI on the institutional adjustments ard reforms that are essential for
integrated basin water resources management for the coming 25 years. These
are directed to: (a) management and allocation of surface and groundwater
resources in a river basin context for multipuxpose use and conservation of
resources; (b) decentralization and deconcentration of wator allocation
decisions and basin operations; (c) treatment of water as a scarce resource;
and (d) enhanciment of community and beneficiary participation in water
resources management. For the irrigation sub-sector, GOI has set out
priorities (Policy Statement of 1987 which has since underpinned Bank-
supported irrigation operations) for: (a) sustained O&M of the existing
infrastructure together with appropriate cost recovery from beneficiaries;
(b) turnover of less than 500 ha public systems to Water User Associations
(WUAs); (c) development of new irrigation in the outer islands for poverty
alleviation and mitigating regional imbalances.
7.         Bank Strategv and Rationale for Bank Invo.vetment.  The Bank is in
broad agreement with the GOI's objectives for water resources and irrigation
development and has had extensive cross-sectoral experience in water projects
in Indonesia. Bank strategy supports GOI's efforts through a coordinated
lendirg program focussed on important and complemen.tary objectives. This
project would focus on efficient water resource utilization in selected Java
basins, improving the sustainability and productivity of the existing
irrigation infrastructure, and turning over small irrigation schemes to WUAs.
Complementary lending includes the following projects:
(a)  The proposed Integrated Swamps Development Project (FY94) would
improve conditions on reclaimed swamp areas for poverty
alleviation and environmental upgrading.
(b)  The proposed Dam Safety Project (FY94) would provide support to a
national Dam Safety Organization and perform remedial works on
some ailing dams.
(c)  The Watershed Conservation Project (FY94) focuses on natural
resources management in critical watersheds.
The proposed project is fully consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy discussed with the Board on April 12, 1994, which emphasized
infrastructure, institutional reform, decentralization, strategic natural
resources management and sustainability.  These elements are strongly
represented in the design of this project.
8.         Proiect Obiectives.  The project has six main objectives:  (a) it
would support the institutional reforms and river basin focused operations
which foster integrated water resources management in Java provinces; (b) it
would continue Bank support, started under earlier'projects, for maximizing
coverage of efficient operation and maintenance of larger irrigation schemes;
(c) expand the Irrigation Service Fee program for cost recovery; (d) and
privatize less than 500 ha public schemes through turning them over to non-



-3
profit water user's associations; (a) it would complete technically and
economically viable rehabilitation of ae yet unimproved public irrigation
systems larger than 500 ha; and (f) carry out remedial works on 11,300 ha of
the Dumpil Irrigation System.
9.         Proiect Comnonents.  There are six major project components:
(a)  River Basin Water Resources Management.  The project would help
achieve GOI's policy and institutional reforms for water
management through: (i) preparing Basin Water Resources Plans in
three river basins; (ii) improving operational procedures,
management techniques and support facilities to enhance real-time
basin water resources management in five river basins;
(iii) establishing appropriate institutional arrangements/
adjustment for allocation of water by provincial governments; and
(iv) establishing procedures and guidelines for bulk water charges
and water supply, drainage, and flood control services.
(b)  Hydrology.  The project would strengthen Hydrological Units of
Provincial Water Resource Services in West, Central and East Java
and Special District of DI Yogyakarta through upgrading the
hydrological network for operational purposes, and providing
hardware and software for timely processing of the collected
hydrological data. Benefits would occur inside and beyond the
basins selected for Basin Water Resources Management.
(c) Turnover to Water Users-Associationse(WUAs). About 356,000 ha of
small (c500 ha) public irrigation systems would be turned over to
private WUAs after Special Maintenance of their physical
structure. The project would accelerate the ongoing program in
order to achieve turnover of about 60 percent of small public
irrigation systems by year 2000.
(d)  Irrigation Development.  Irrigation development would cover about
230,000 ha through rehabilitation, remedial works, expansion and
new schemes. About 202,000 ha of medium-sized (generally 500 ha
to 3,000 ha) public irrigation systems would be rehabilitated.
They need modest investments to ensure long-term, sustained
production.
(e)  Efficient Operation and Maintenance (EOM).  EOM is aimed at
providing planned services to users and maintaining the systems
into the future. The project would add 218,000 ha of irrigated
land to EOM coverage from areas under irrigation development in
the project plus 42,000 ha of recently-rehabilitated Special
Projects systems. By the end of the project, about 92 percent of
all public irrigation systems in Java are expected to be under
EOM, contributing to sustainability.
(f)  Irriaation Service Fees.  Irrigation Service Fees support the GOI
program of direct cost recovery for O&M from irrigation
beneficiaries on publicly managed schemes. The project would
extend these fees to 100 percent of the public irrigation systems
on Java by year 2000.



-4-
Minor project components would improve flood forecasting and water monitoring
systems, establish river structure maintenance procedures, introduce and test
vetiver grass or similar hedgerow grasses in selected basins for erosion
control and promote public awareness of water pollution and conservation
issues.
10.        Proiect Pinancina and Implementation.  Total project costs are
estimated at US$304.0 million. The proposed loan of USS165.7 million would
finance 54 percent of total costs, or 59 percent of costs exclusive of
vehicles (US$2.9 m$ilion) and taxes. (US$21.0 million). GOI would provide
US$133.8 mUllion equivalent and Water User's Associations would provide US$4.5
million equivalent as equity in the form of labor contributions. A breakdown
of project costs and the financing plan are presented in Schedule A, and the
amounts and methods of procurement are in Schedule B. A timetable for key
project processing events is in Schedule D. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 12872-IND, dated May 25, i994, is being distributed
separately.
11.        Imylementation.  The Directerate General of Water Resources
Development (DGWRD) in the Ministry of Public Works would implement the
project except for the Irrigation Servica Fee component which would be
implemented at the local level with support from DGPUOD in the Ministry of
Home Affairs. DGWRD would be responsitle for all procurement, including
technical assistance, except for procurement under the Irrigation Service Fee
component which would be handled by DGPUOD.
12.        Proiest Sustainabilit,.  The purpose of the Efficient Operation
and Maintenance component is to fund needs-based O&M budgets and ensure that
further rehabilitation is not needed. This is a central project feature
comprising 20 percent of base costs and is reflected in loan conditions on
government financing. Government agreement not to use loan proceeds for EOC
funding and to introduce irrigation service fees on a Java-wide basis
demonstrates commitment to sustainability. Bringing systems up to the level
justifying entry into EON is the objective of rehabilitation and upgrading on
larger schemes. Special maintenance in small service areas is also directed
to sustainablity. Coavarsion of land out of agricultural production is one
threat to sustainability and sensitivity analysis shows that shorter benefit
streams severely drive down returns. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that land use planning would not anticipate conversion of r'a>bilitated areas
for at least 10 years.
13.        Environmental Assessment.  Negative environmental impacts are
minimal. Most of the project is directed to existing curltivated and irrigated
areas. Preliminary environmental analysis eliminated 38,000 ha from
consideration. Specific environmental issues have been raised in three out of
approximately 220 schemes. These three projects have been placed on a
deferred list requiring additional environmental analysis and economic
justification as a condition of disbursement. The project would promote more
frequent water quality sampling, place provincial environmental bureaus on
provincial water management committees, and introduce and test vetiver hedge
row technology for erosion and sedimentation control on a pilot basis.
14.        Action Aereed. Agreement was reached with GOI at negotiations on
the following:



-5-
(a)  Special maintenanee estimated-to cost in excess of the agreed
individual scheme review threshold, would be subject to additional
economic and design justification and approval;
(b)  Final selection of schemes for rehabilitation and expansion would
require: (i) confirmation of dependable irrigation water
availability; (ii) an estimated ERR acceptable to the Bank;
(iii) acceptance of farmers to participate in WUAs, and WUAs
preparedness for rehabilitation and procedures establiohed for
ISP; (iv) Government confirmation that scheme sites would not be
converted to non-agricultural uses for a period of at least ten
years.
(c)  Consultants would be employed by January 15, 1995, except for the
irrigation Service Fee component which would be April 30, 1995;
(d)  The project would be carried out according to Detailed Inter-
Agency Action Plans and Annual Work Programs reviewed with the
Bank; and project activities would be subject to Financial and
Technical Audits;
(e)  Basin Water Management Committees (BWMC) or similar committees and
Basin Water Operations Units (BWOU) would be established in each
basin selected for real-time water management not later than
November 1, 1994. Basin Water Resources Management (BWRM) would
be implemented in accordance with DGWRD's Integrated Water
-     Resources Management Position Paper (December 1993), GOI's
Strategy Paper for Integrated Water Resources Management (May 16,
1994) and the Detailed Inter-Agency Action Plan reviewed and
agreed with the Bank.
(f)  Resettlement would be avoided or minimized under the project.  If
resettlement ts unavoidable in some areas (which is poseible in
connection with rehabilitated or expanded irrigation schemes)
before carrying out the works, the Government would:  (i) prepare
a resettlement plan for affected individuals in accordance with
policies, planning principles, institutional arrangements and
design criteria agreed with the Bank; and (ii) design resettlement
so as to improve the living standards of those resettled.
Further, the resettlement plan would be submitted to the Bank for
approval and measures to ensure resettlement follows plans
approved by the Bank would be taken.
15.        Conditions of Disbursement.  (a) As a condition of loan
disbursement against civil works expenditures (excluding survey, design and
investigation) for rehabilitation of the three schemes placed on a deferred
list for envirommental reasons, Government would obtain prior approval by the
Bank of design, costs, benefits and environmental analysis; and (b) As a
condition of disbursement against Dumpil remedial works expenditures, the Bank
would have to receive and approve (i) cost estimates and designs for the
remedial works; and (ii) evidence of adequate water availability for the
Dumpil Irrigation scheme, based on actual measurements of Lusi river flows,
before authorizing disbursements against Dumpil remedial works expenditures.
16.        Prolect Benefits.  The project would create the framework for
integrated water resources management to resolve competing demand issues and



-6-
improve real-time management. It would increase rice production on Java and
protect existing infrastructure from deterioration while relieving 001 of
responsibility for a large number of small irrigation schemes. Over a million
farm families would benefit. The estimated ERR for irrigation development and
turnover is about 17 percent. These components account for about 62 percent
of total project base cost, including the share of efficient oper"tion and
maintenance costs for these schemes.
17.        Risks.  Institutional, technical, and economic risks exist;
environmental risks are minimal. The iJUAs are very important for the
implementation of EOM, collection of ISF, tuirnover of smaller irrigation
schemes, and for improvement of water distribution and management at the farm
level. The quality of WUA development and training, including social and
community participation mast be adequate to minimize risks. ISF collection
could be difficult. The WUA emphasis on collection responsibility and having
M4A issue an advisory/guidelines on collection will bolster the performance of
ISF collection. Success depends on improved delivery of services after
rehabilitation, channeling ISF back to irrigation schemes facilitated by
decrees to streamline this process, and reasonable fees geared to needs-based
budgets, with exemptions for crop-failure and non-delivery of water. The
government needs to maintain commitment to the integrated water resources
management process and institutions. Here favorable outcomes require
provincial cooperation and beneficiary participati-n.  Recent decrees and
policy development demonstrate serious GOI commitment.  Technical risks are
minimal considering that the proposed technologies have been tested and proven
elsewhere. A number of irrigaticn schemes proposed for rehabilitation will
still require feasibility studies and preparation of detailed designs prior to
implementation. The project can further minimize technical risks bys
(a) careful screening and selection of the planned irrigation schemes; and
(b) providing special attention to quality control, monitoring and evaluation
of the technical performanee. Technical audits are also required. Economic
viability largely depends on containing investment and production costs,
achieving the expected benefits in a timely fashion, and rice prices.
Preliminary economic analysis is quite favorable. Returns are fairly robust
against adverse changes in production costs and rice prices, except for rice
prices in some turnover models. Higher cost rehabilitation (over
Rp 1,000,000/ha) would be subjected to additional economic justification, as
.would special maintenance above the review threshold. Implementation phasing
is designed to minimize disruption of farming and accelerate the beginning of
benefit streams.
18.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
