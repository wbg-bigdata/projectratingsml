JAVA IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT
AND WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
LOAN ANM PRoJEcT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Republic of Indonesia
Loan Amount:           US$165.7 million equivalent
Terms:                 Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
Project Description:   The project has six objectives:  (a) it would support the
institutional reforms and basin focused operations which foster
integrated water resources management in Java provinces; (b) it
would continue the Bank support, started under earlier projects, for
maximizing coverage of efficient operation and maintenance of
larger irrigation schemes; (c) expand the Irrigation Service Fee
program for cost recovery; (d) privatize small public schemes (ess
than 500 ha) through turning them over to non-profit water user's
associations; (e) support the implementation of remedial works on
about 11,300 ha of the Dumpil Irrigation system; and (f) it would
complete technically and economically viable rehabilitation of as
yet unimproved public irrigation systems larger than 500 ha.
Project components are: (a) support for policy and institutional
reform for integrated water resources management; river basin
planning in three basins; improved real-time water management
operations in five basins on Java; (b) strengthening hydrological
data and information systems; (c) support for special maintenance
of 356,000 ha of small irrigation schemes and turning them over
to not-for-profit Water Users Associations; (d) irrigation
rehabilitation, expansion and upgrading, and remedial works on
about 230,000 ha across Java; (e) introduction of sustainable,
efficient operation and maintenance to avoid the need for repeat
rehabilitation; (f) expanding Irrigation Service Fees to schemes
above 500 ha in size in all remaining areas of Java to establish
user-pays systems and support for operation and maintenance.
Benefits:              The policy, institutional, and operational basis for integrated water
resources management would be established in areas of increasing
water scarcity.  Rehabilitated and well-maintained irrigation
systems would raise rice yields, increase cropping intensity
(multiple cropping) and expand area coverage by the system. Over
a million farm families on small holdings would benefit. Vital

irrigation infrastructure would be placed on a steady-state, user-
pays basis to avoid future deterioration.
Risks:                 Active, cross sectoral, water allocation and management with user
participation requires continued commitment to new institutions,
strategies and decentralization. Irrigation rehabilitation is a proven
intervention, but it may be difficult to shift publicly-fimded O&M
costs to beneficiaries. Steps to channel fees collected directly back
to O&M entities on irrigation schemes where collected will
improve incentives. Higher construction costs and lower rice
prices can threaten returns from irrigation development.
Shortening the benefit stream by converting land out of agriculture
can lower returns; coordination with land use planning and
assurances of non-conversion help contain this risk.

PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. IN1RODUCIION
1.1         Irrigated agriculture, concentrated on Java, has been at the heart of Indonesia's
rapid rural development, transition to rice self-sufficiency, and notable drop in poverty levels.
Agricultural growth has outpaced population growth by 1 percent per year for two decades,
while even more rapid expansion of the services and manufacturing sectors have shrunk
agriculture's share of GDP to 20 percent. Faced with growing non-agriculture water demands
and diminished prospects for new irrigation on Java, the challenges are sustaining
infrastructure, increased efficiency of water use, and new approaches to planning,
management, and allocation. Following the success of components of earlier Bank-supported
irrigation projects, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank assistance for a
Java Irrigation Improvement and Water Resources Management Project (JIWMP) which is
directed to rehabilitation, turning over small irrigation schemes to water users associations,
cost-recovery, improved efficiency and sustainability of existing irrigation schemes on Java.
In addition, it would lay the foundation for multi-sectoral planning and management. The
project is transitional in nature: it addresses the advanced stages of irrigation development on
much of Java while looking ahead to broader issues of water resources management.
B. AGRICULTURE ON JAVA
1.2         Agriculture provides employment to approximately 55 percent of the labor force
and generates half of non-oil exports. The island of Java has historically been at the center
of agricultural development in Indonesia. Yet Java faces serious land and water constraints
to sustained economic growth. It contains 60 percent of the Indonesian population (186
million), the bulk of its industry and over half of irrigated agriculture (60 percent of the total
5.2 million irrigated ha), but only 7-8 percent of its land and water resources. The population
density of Java is high at 814 per square km compared with 93 for all of Indonesia. Expanded
irrigation, more intensive input use and the adoption of high yielding varieties have led to
substantial increases in the production of rice and other palawija (secondary) crops. The
average yield of irrigated padi, 5.4 tons/ha, is one of the highest in the world, but the yields
of palawija crops are relatively low by world standards. Java contributes 60 percent of
Indonesia's rice production, of which 86 percent comes from irrigated lands. Rice remains
the leading dietary staple providing about 55 percent of calorie intake. Although Indonesia has
achieved self-sufficiency in rice production and has been a marginal exporter in some years,
it has not yet reached the turning point where higher incomes mean less rather than more
household rice consumption.



- 2 -
1.3         About 60 percent of the farm holdings in Java are less than 0.5 ha against
35 percent for all Indonesia. Nearly 70 percent of the farms are owner operated and non-
farming activities contribute significantly to household income. Average farm income on the
JIWMP schemes, which are relatively unimproved, varies from Rp 400,000 to 1,200,000/ha
depending on soils, topography and conditions of the irrigation systems. The average padi
yield (about 4.7 ton/ha) on these schemes is also lower than the Java average. Farmer income
depends critically on the availability and management of water resources in the dry season.
C. CHALLENGES FOR IRRIGATION AND WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
1.4         Run-Off and Irrigated Area. The mean annual run-off from Java is about 175
billion m3, which reduces to around 78 billion m3 in a one-in-five low rainfall year. Irrigation
is the largest user of surface water requiring about 57 billion m3/year, mainly from the run-of-
the-river supplies as the dams impound only 8 billion m3/year. During the dry years, padi
irrigation is reduced to meet other higher priority demands. A total of 3.2 million ha on Java
is irrigated (half of total agricultural area) of which 2.7 million ha are publicly managed. The
bulk of the larger schemes have been previously rehabilitated. About 1.1 million ha, including
700,000 ha on small systems, remain unimproved and need rehabilitation or minor upgrading
which would increase water availability and reduce siltation, leakage, and deterioration.
1.5         Critical Shortages and Limited Additional Storage. Many river basins in
Java face critical water shortages in the dry season especially near major urban centers. The
marked inter-annual variation of flows in the river systems combined with physiographic
situation, i.e., many short steep catchments with relatively low groundwater recharge
potentials, mean that much of wet season discharge (about 80 percent of the annual) must flow
to the sea in the absence of containment structures. Overall, water availability declines from
West to East and from South to North. East Java is the most water stressed province on the
island. Storage reservoirs can help ease the situation as well as intensify irrigation of existing
areas. However, only a few viable sites have been identified and tend to be located in heavily
settled areas. There are also physical constraints to expanding irrigation in existing schemes
or into new areas either because of extreme land and topography constraints, or non-
availability of water. Such potential is estimated to be no more than about 30,000 ha in the
whole of Java, and its development would depend on the limited availability of water in the
dry season. Shortages combined with limited new storage potential heighten the importance
of effective water management.
1.6         Competing Demands. The Municipal and Industrial (M&I) water use in Java
is estimated at about 2.5 billion m3, a significant proportion of which comes from groundwater
sources. These demands are increasing rapidly because of exploding urbanization and rising
industrialization. The basin-wide irrigation water use efficiency in the dry season is generally
high in many critical basins. As a consequence, future M&I needs in critical basins will come
largely at the expense of dry season irrigation. M&I use is, at present, minor compared to the
irrigation use (95 percent of average annual diversion is for irrigation) but is expected to
double within a decade. A second consequence of high efficiency is that not much water can
be freed by improving scheme efficiencies of irrigation systems in these basins without
completing rehabilitation. Reallocations from irrigation (as is de facto happening), especially
in those coastal areas where groundwater is depleted/contaminated, will become necessary in
critical situations to meet rapidly expanding M&I demands. This will be at the cost of lost
agricultural production and income. Without proper development and management, water



requirements that compete with irrigation, coupled with neglected maintenance of existing
schemes in the absence of new investment, could undermine Indonesia's food self-sufficiency,
and the vitality of the Javanese rural economy.
1.7         Pollution. River pollution, mainly from human and industrial wastes, is serious
on many rivers and reduces usable water. Maintaining low season flows, pollution abatement,
matching higher quality groundwater to municipal rather than industrial needs, and greater
attention to water quality in planning, allocation and management, are pressing challenges.
Water quantity and quality issues on Java are discussed in the 1990 Bank study
Indonesia-Sustained Development of Forests, Land and Water (No. 7822-IND) and more
recently in Indonesia-Environment andDevelopment: Challengesforthe Future (August 9,
1993, No. 12083-IND).

General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD) in the Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
and so far has been concerned primarily with irrigation, flood control and hydropower
generation. Responsibility for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation network
largely has been decentralized to the provincial governments. (See PWRS discussion below).
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is in charge of (i) Irrigation Service Fees (ISF) through
its Directorate General for Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (DGPUOD) and the
Directorate of Regional Finance and (ii) provision of irrigation O&M budget through its
Directorate General of Regional Development. The Ministry of Agriculture is involved with
research and development, agricultural support services and production intensification. The
Ministry of Finance oversees property taxation (BPP) which raises revenue for O&M.
Reflecting the strategic importance of water, a Bureau of Water Resources and Irrigation has
been recently created in BAPPENAS, the National Development Planning Agency.
1.9         The provincial Public Works Services on Java provide technical services for
water resources (Pengairan), roads (Bina Marga), and housing and urban development (Cipta
Karya). According to Government Regulation 23/1982, management and regulation of surface
water and O&M of public irrigation facilities up to tertiary head gates are the responsibility
of Provincial Water Resource Services (PWRS). Since 1992, the PWRS in the three large Java
provinces have been raised to a Departmental (Dinas) level in order to focus on broader water
resources management issues. The heads of PWRS report to and are administratively
responsible to the Governor. However, for technical oversight and approvals of contract
awards (above certain limits), they are under the control of DGWRD. Within the DGWRD,
Directorate Irrigation I (DOI-I) is responsible for guiding and coordinating provincial irrigation
activities. DOI-I also serves as the link between PWRSs and DGWRD/GOI for obtaining
budgetary support to foreign-aided development projects. The PWRS are also supported by
the Directorates of Swamps and Rivers, and by the Directorates of Planning and Programming
and Procurement. However, DGWRD is reorganizing along regional rather than functional
lines which should improve support for deconcentrated and decentralized functions. Guidance
on more complex hydrologic issues can be sought from the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering
(IHE) at Bandung. Water Users Associations (WUAs) have been the farmer-beneficiary
organizations with increasing roles in O&M at the local level.
1.10        Because of serious water constraints in Java, river basin water resources
management (BWRM) covering a complete basin or compact of small basins, and operated by



- 4 -
a Government institution under appropriate regulatory guidelines, has become necessary. This
is a sweeping initiative. MPW has grouped the Java rivers into 15 river basin territories
(SWS) through Regulation 48/1990, with the objective of reinforcing the planning,
development and management of water resources through a river basin approach. Existing
institutions and policies, particularly the PWRS, and the delegation of responsibilities for cross-
sectoral management, will need fundamental adjustment and strengthening to carry out the
broader, BWRM mandate. In the decentralized environment, provincial leadership will be
necessary for success.  Significant steps have been taken which will be reinforced by this
project.
E. PROJECr SIm7ING
1.11        Geographic and Physical.  Only two seasons prevail-a wet season (from
November to April), when about 75 percent-80 percent of average annual rainfall may fall, and
a dry season (May to October). Rainfall decreases from about 3,000 mm in western parts of
West Java to approximately 1,800 mm in the east. Soil fertility is high; temperatures and
humidity are relatively constant. Wet season flood damage is a risk to crops, property and
life, and non-irrigated dry season rice production is difficult and often unrewarding. Wet
season drainage and flood control as well as careful dry season irrigation water management
are important project objectives. Improved water management and sustainable infrastructure
for the farmer means higher cropping intensity, higher yields, and reduced losses due to
drought, flooding, and deterioration of delivery systems. The water resources management
component of the project (see map) would cover basins distributed across Java, except the
Special Area (DKI) of Jakarta. Other components would be island-wide in scope.
1.12        Irrigation Schemnes.  The MPW  irrigation systems are of three types:
technical, semi-technical, and simple. A technical system usually takes off from a permanent
weir or a gated barrage, consists of main and secondary (and tertiary) canals, and is equipped
with control structures and measuring devices enabling the discharge of irrigation water to be
fully controlled and measured. The semi-technical systems, also, mostly take off from
permanent or temporary weirs, but have fewer control structures and measuring devices. In
these systems the discharge can not be fully controlled. The simple systems are usually fed
by free intakes, and have minimal or no control structures; these are normally farmer
managed. In such systems, the discharge can neither be measured nor controlled. There are
several large systems (above 10,000 ha) in Java e.g., Jatiluhur (240,000 ha), Rentang (90,000
ha), West Tarum (80,000 ha) in West Java; Pemali Comal (124,000 ha) in Central Java;
Pekalen (123,000 ha), Sampean (19,000 ha) in East Java. All large systems are technical. In
addition, there are several hundred medium (3,000 ha to 10,000 ha), and small Oess than
3,000 ha) systems. Distribution of areas, equipped with irrigation facilities, in each province
is given in Table 1.1 below.
1.13        Operation and Maintenance. In 1987, recognizing the adverse effects of
neglected maintenance, GOI enunciated a new policy for the irrigation subsector, which placed
a greater emphasis on the efficient operation and maintenance of all government controlled
irrigation systems (those larger than 500 ha), increased O&M expenditures, promoted greater
participation of Water User Associations (WUAs) in the operation and maintenance of
irrigation systems, and turned over management of smaller systems to the beneficiaries.
Turnover occurred after simple upgrading called Special Maintenance. An Irrigation Service
Fee (1SF) levy was introduced on larger systems under public sector management to cover



O&M costs. Initially, this was tested on pilot areas but was gradually extended to other areas.
GOI has policies in place to turnover O&M of all small schemes on Java to farmer groups and
to universally introduce ISF on Java. Neither policy is fully implemented, but implementation
is on schedule as set by the government's action program.

F. SuBSECTOR OBJEcIVE
1.14           The broader subsector objectives for Java are:
(a)    establish comprehensive and decentralized, integrated basin water resources
management with attention to allocation, drainage, flood control and water
quality for agriculture, municipalities and industry;
(b)    improve water use efficiency in the irrigation subsector by introducing efficient,
adequately funded O&M practices; rehabilitate and upgrade existing schemes;
involve beneficiaries through turning over small schemes to WUAs; create
provincial and basin water committees with user participation; and
(c)    promote sustainability through extension of ISF and laying the foundation for
bulk water charges and water service fees; and maintaining safe dam structures.
These objectives require new institutions, planning, and policies, and an improved hydrological
data base. Rehabilitation and upgrading of existing irrigation schemes helps ensure maximum
benefits from a scarce resource; serious water constraints require managing water quantity and
quality for agricultural, urban, and industrial needs in an integrated manner. The project
addresses both.

BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LESSONS LEARNED
A. BANK INVoLVEMENr IN THE IRRIGATION SUBCTOR
2.1         The Bank has heavily supported water related projects in rural Indonesia, e.g.
irrigation operations including swamp reclamation, flood control and a multi-purpose dam; two
large hydro-electric projects; and a number of water supply and urban drainage projects.
Irrigation has absorbed a major part of Bank lending to Indonesia for agriculture (27
operations with loans of some US$2.0 billion). The outcome of completed irrigation
operations in Java have all been successful, in contrast to generally poor results of irrigation
projects in the outer islands. The average ERR at PCR or OED evaluation has been 22 percent
for 22 irrigation projects (unweighted), including the underperformers in the outer islands.
The average, unweighted ERR for Java irrigation projects was 27 percent. Six irrigation or
water resources projects were under supervision in FY93 having a project cost of US$1.41
billion and an aggregate loan amount of US$803 million. A summary of irrigation lending
appears in Annex 5.
2.2         Early irrigationprojects concentrated on irrigation expansion, rehabilitation, and
institution building, and succeeded in rapidly increasing rice production and raising rural
incomes. The second generation of projects have focussed more on the sustainability and
efficiency of existing infrastructure by financing O&M, decentralization of management,
involvement of beneficiaries, collection of service fees, balanced regional growth and some
privatization. The Bank has also financed urban water supply and sanitation projects, together
with municipal water enterprise development and improved cost recovery. Bank-financed
projects succeeded in strengthening the PWRS organizations in Java for irrigation works and
in raising irrigation O&M standards.
2.3         Rehabilitation of the medium and small irrigation projects started in East Java
in 1982 with assistance from the Bank under East Java Irrigation Project (EJIP, Loan 2119-
IND), and in Central and West Java in 1986, under the Central and West Java Provincial
Irrigation Project (CWJIP, Loan 2649-IND). Prior to these provincial projects, several small
and medium irrigation systems varying in size from less than 500 ha to 5,000 ha had also been
rehabilitated in Java along with much bigger systems like Madiun (12,000 ha), Pemali-Comal
(123,000 ha), West Tarum (80,000 ha) etc. After EJIP and CWJIP, upgrading or special
maintenance (SM) of several small systems was carried out in Java, under the Bank-financed
Irrigation Subsector Project I (ISSP I, Loan 2880-IND, 1987), and the ongoing ISSP II (Loan
3392-IND, 1991). These last two projects are the close precursors to JIWMP and have helped
pioneer ISF, cost-recovery, privatization or turnover of small schemes and basin management.
In addition, they have undertaken the introduction of Efficient O&M (EOM) and the more
standard activity of rehabilitation.

B. LESSONS LEARNED
2.4         Problems identified during the Bank supervision and in recent PCRs related to
irrigation operations in Java include: (a) weak processing of hydrological data and a lack of
well-formulated basin water management plans; (b) lack of provisions for real-time
management of water resources on the basin level; (c) insufficient attention to safety and
upkeep of existing dams; and (d) O&M deficiencies resulting mainly from financial constraints
and low cost recovery. Overly-optimistic assumptions regarding implementation, increased
cropping intensities, conversion of dry-land to padi, shifting food crop patterns and price
forecasts, contributed to poor performance in some off-Java irrigation projects. Experience
from monitoring and evaluation of the ongoing ISSP II turnover program indicates that user
involvement in planning, design, and construction activities aimed at system improvement is
a strong motivating factor in WUA development. It also points out the need to simplify the
SM designs and decrease the amount of preparatory works in Java, where farmers are
traditionally working together in a variety of agricultural activities. The introduction of ISF
under ISSP II demonstrates the importance of adequate institutional preparation, stabilization
of fees, and assured water delivery before initiating cost-recovery type programs. The critical
role of WUAs in the collection process is underscored. Experience from these projects
highlighted the need for an integrated approach to water resources management to relieve the
growing problems of water availability and quality, especially near the main urban centers, and
reaffirms the value of rehabilitation, turnover, and ISF.
C. GOI STRATEGY AND RATIONAL FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
2.5         Water Resources Management. An International Water Resources Seminar
held in November 1992, initiated serious deliberations within GOI on the institutional
adjustments and reforms that are essential for integrated Basin Water Resources Management
(BWRM) for the coming 25 years (Annex 2). These are directed to: management and
allocation of surface and groundwater resources in a river basin context for multipurpose use
and conservation of resources; water allocations and basin operations decentralized in
provinces, close to the beneficiaries; treatment of water as a scarce resource; charging for
water supply distribution services; and enhancement of community participation in BWRM.
Water Resources is now a separate sector under GOI's budget structure. Accordingly,
allocation/reallocation decisions will rest with the Provincial Governors assisted by Provincial
Water Resources Committees (PWMC) appointed by the Governor and having a broad sectoral
representation. Basin operations would be carried out by the Water Resources Management
Unit (WMU), administratively under PWRS but guided by a Basin Water Resources
Committee (BWRM). The policies relating to municipal water supply are articulated in GOI's
statement (1987) of policies for urban development. GOI has in operation a five-year
BAPPEDAL Development Plan for strengthening the environmental management and pollution
control capacities of GOI agencies. This is being supported by a Bank TA Project (Loan 3453-
IND). DGWRD has also developed an Integrated Water Resources management Position
Paper (see Annex 15 for reference) to be followed by a GOI Strategy Paper.
2.6         Irrigation Strategy. For the irrigation subsector, GOI has set out priorities
(Policy Statement of 1987) for: (a) sustained O&M of the existing infrastructure together with
appropriate cost recovery from beneficiaries; (b) turnover of less than 500 ha systems to
WUAs; (c) completion of agricultural and land development on nearly-completed schemes off-



- 8 -
Java so as to realize agricultural benefits quickly; and (d) development of new irrigation in the
outer islands for poverty alleviation and mitigating regional imbalances. The Government has
maintained a strong commitment to adequate levels of O&M funding to help ensure efficiency
and sustainability.
2.7          Bank Support for Strategy Objectives. The Bank is in broad agreement with
GOI's strategic objectives. Under ISSP I & II, the Bank assisted in covering incremental
costs, on a declining basis, of higher O&M allocations for rehabilitated schemes to introduce
efficient O&M (EOM). As ISF is introduced, Government financing will decrease. Turnover
and cost recovery are also supported under ISSP II (Loan 3392-IND) while the outer island
agenda is facilitated under PIADP (Loan 3302-IND) and the Ground Water Development
Project (Loan 3588-IND). The Bank is coordinating its efforts with ADB and sharing
experiences under the 1987 Irrigation Policy Statement and Action Plan.
2.8          The Bank's lending program is designed to achieve complementary objectives:
(a)   This project, JIWMP, would focus on efficient water resource utilization in
selected Java river basins, improving the sustainability and productivity of the
existing irrigation infrastructure, and extending needs-based service fees to
users together with improved O&M.
(b)   The recently-appraised Integrated Swamps Development Project (FY94) would
improve conditions on reclaimed swamp areas for poverty alleviation and
environmental upgrading.
(c)   The Dam Safety Project (FY94) will provide support to the national Dam
Safety Organization and perform remedial works on some ailing dams which
pose dangers to public safety and threaten water management.
(d)   Finally, the recently-appraised Watershed Conservation Project (FY94) would
focus on natural resources management in critical watersheds.
2.9          A study of improved institutional arrangements for water resources management
in the Jabotabek region, with rapidly expanding population and industrialization, is underway
with support from JUDP II (Loan 3219-IND). A separate series of projects has addressed
rural groundwater and municipal water supply and sanitation, the latest member of which is
the proposed Jakarta Water Supply Sector Project. A possible successor project to JIWMP,
on a smaller scale, would extend water resource management, planning, hydrological
assessment and institutional support to other basins and the outer islands.
2.10         Rationale for Bank Involvement. Because of its heavy involvement and rich
cross- sectoral experience with water related projects, the Bank is well-positioned to help GOI
implement an integrated water resources management strategy and irrigation scheme
rehabilitation.  The project would consolidate policies (cost recovery, O&M  funding,
privatization of small irrigation systems and institutional strengthening) started under the first
Irrigation Subsector Project and continued under ISSP II. The project would extend Irrigation
Service Fee collection to users inside and outside the project's target basins, thereby redressing
inequities of present coverage and building synergistically on ISSP I and II. The proposed
project would benefit a large number of poor farmers, with land holdings of less than 0.5 ha.



- 9 -
In addition, the project would further develop the river basin approach to managing water
resources and strengthen both long-term planning and real-time allocation.
2.11         Linkage to Country Assistance Strategy. The project components are in
accordance with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy discussed with the Board on April 12,
1994. This strategy emphasized infrastructure, institutional reform, decentralization, strategic
natural resources management and sustainability. These are strongly represented in the design
of the project.  Rehabilitation and special maintenance are directed to infrastructure.
Institutional strengthening would occur through: (a) establishing appropriate institutional
arrangements for BWRM planning and real-time water management operations; (b) increasing
the capability of PWRS in river basin operations, hydrological data processing and flood
warning systems; (c) training WUAs in new ISF and turnover areas; and (d) installing a
programming and monitoring system (PMS) to provide orderly execution of the project,
including computerized project management CPM for sequencing within each component.
Basin water resources management and rehabilitation of irrigation schemes promote efficient
use of a strategic natural resource. User participation underlies the institutional changes for
water management, the roles of WUAs, and the turnover of small schemes. Decentralization
and privatization are inherent in the provincial and basin approaches to management and in
turnover objectives. Cost-recovery and user-pays principles are incorporated into the Irrigation
Service Fees program. Sustainability is emphasized through infrastructure maintenance and
placing O&M on a steady-state path through the transition to EOM with higher levels of
funding. Finally, the project includes improved water quality sampling; representation of
provincial environmental bureaus on water committees to improve the linkage between water
allocation, quality, and pollution enforcement; a public awareness campaign on the importance
of pollution control and conservation; and some erosion and sediment control activities.
However, primary responsibility for water quality testing and control would remain with the
environmental agencies.

THE PROJECT
A. PROJECr CONcEPr AND OBJECTIVES
3.1         Project Concept. First, the project would support institutional reforms and
planning and basin operations for integrated water resources management in selected river
basins on Java. This would be carried out within the framework of GOI's second 25-year
objectives for Water Resources Development and Management. Annex 2 discusses the
approach to integrated water resources management.  Selected basins have current or
anticipated dry season shortages and competing demands. Under ISSP n (Loan 3392-IND)
pilot river basin management schemes have been initiated in two basins included under this
project. Second, the project would contribute to achieving the goals of GOI's 1987 Policy
Statement for the irrigation subsector-rehabilitation, privatization, and improved
sustainability-on a large scale across Java. Small schemes would receive special maintenance
and be turned over to private, not-for profit Water Users Associations; larger schemes would
receive rehabilitation or upgrading, be placed under a sustainable O&M regime to preempt
further rehabilitation, and a service fee program would be instituted with the fee level linked
to efficient O&M costs.
3.2         Project Objectives. The project has five primary objectives: (a) support the
institutional reforms and basin-focussed operations for integrated water resources management;
(b) bring the share of small schemes on Java that have received special maintenance and been
turned over to 60 percent; (c) complete technically and economically viable rehabilitation or
upgrading of unimproved irrigation systems serving over 200,000 ha (generally 500 to 3,000
ha in size); (d) support funding for sustainable, efficient 0 & M (EOM) in schemes under
previous projects and place schemes rehabilitated under the project under EOM; and (e)
introduce Irrigation Service Fees (ISF), to be paid by farmers, in virtually all remaining areas
of Java. Succeeding in these objectives would provide a replicable approach to water resources
management; remove government from small scheme management; and create a significant
number of well-functioning, sustainable and largely self-financing irrigation schemes. Direct
economic benefits would result from safe-guarding and improving infrastructure and better
system management. This would elevate water use efficiency, expand crop areas, and boost
yields. More than one million small-scale farm families would benefit.
B. BRiEF PROJEcT DESCRIPTION
3.3         The project would be implemented over about six years from October 1994, to
June 30, 2000. The project would consist of six components directed to integrated river basin
management, hydrology, turnover of small schemes to beneficiaries, rehabilitation and
remedial works, EOM and service fees. The water resources management components would



- 11 -
establish comprehensive, real-time management of bulk water distribution, drainage, flood
control and O&M under a single, decentralized administrative unit in selected basins. Planning
and hydrology would be strengthened and river structure operation and maintenance would be
improved.  Water allocation accounting and water delivery and drainage service cost
accounting systems would lay the foundation for bulk water charges and water service fees.
The irrigation components of the project would turn over about 356,000 ha of small public
irrigation systems to non-profit, WUAs after special maintenance of physical infrastructure;
rehabilitate and upgrade larger schemes (> 500 ha) serving 218,000 ha; carry out remedial
works on 11,300 ha of the Dumpil Irrigation system; provide sustainable, efficient O&M
(EOM) on rehabilitated schemes; and introduce irrigation service fees (ISF) to all remaining
large schemes on Java. ISF levies would be tied to needs-based O&M budgets, reducing
government expenditure and promoting cost recovery. Minor project components would
improve flood forecasting and water monitoring systems (under BWRM), establish river
maintenance procedures, test hedge-row grass (e.g., vetiver) in selected basins for erosion
control, and promote public awareness of water pollution and conservation issues. About
55 percent of project costs are for civil works and another 20 percent is for EOM. (Annex
6 contains details of minor components).
C. DETAILED PROJEcr FEATURES
(i) River Basin Water Resources Management
3.4         River Basin Water Resources Management (BWRM) would include:
(a) preparation of long-term water resource plans for three basins to provide guidance to assure
efficient use of basin water resources to best meet national and regional goals; (b) real-time
water management and operations in five basins, to equitably serve municipal, industrial,
agricultural and other demands; (c) a pilot river infrastructure and facilities management and
maintenance program. The project would also strengthen the institutional base for water
management, set up water and cost accounting systems, analyze and improve the water rights
system, and evolve a Water Service Fees framework for water users and apply it on a pilot
basis in three of the project basins. A Detailed Inter-Agency Action Plan for Water Resources
Management appears in Annex 1.  Details of the approach to integrated river basin
management, based on DGWRD's Position Paper and GOI's Strategy Paper, are given in
Annex 2 with a description of basin characteristics. The river basins were selected for water
limitations, competing users, representativeness and replicability (see following paragraphs and
Map).
3.5         Basin Water Resource Plans (US$3.0 million, 1 percent of base cost). Basin
Water Resource Plans would be prepared for three basins: Jratunseluna/Garang, Cidurian-
Ciujung, and Citarum. Real-time operations will also be improved in the first two under the
project. Citarum basin is experiencing rapid economic development and water demands are
rising rapidly, particularly in the vicinity of Jakarta and Bandung. The primary purpose of
planning is to assure effective guidance and coordination of many government and private
sector activities in the basin, guide investment, and assist evolving real-time operations. A
modest Public Awareness Program component will target government officials and the general
public with information on water resources issues, pollution prevention, flood plain use, the
purpose of government management initiatives, etc. The project would finance consultant
services, equipment and training to carry out these activities.



- 12 -
3.6         Basin Water Resources Management (US$23.9 million, 10 percent of base
cost). Real-time Basin Water Resources Management would be introduced or expanded in five
basin areas:  Cidurian/Ciujung, Jratunseluna/Garang, Sampean, Opak-Progo-Oyo and
Cisanggarung basins. Pilot basin operations have started in August 1992, in the Cisanggarung
and Opak-Progo-Oyo regions under ISSP-II (Loan 3392-IND). The objective would be to
attain efficient and reliable day-to-day management of the basins' water resources through:
establishment of an appropriate institutional arrangement for carrying out BWRM with a cross-
sectoral focus; the control and delivery of bulk water supplies to various users in the basin;
operation and upkeep of the primary hydraulic infrastructure that are publicly managed; storm
drainage and flood control; and maintenance of a healthy river stream environment. The focus
would initially be on surface water resources but gradually the management of both surface
water and ground water would be integrated in the basin. Key steps to be taken for BWRM
include establishing PWMCs, BWMCs, BWOUs; completing an inventory of existing laws,
decrees and regulations; finalizing allocation policy procedures and guidelines for allocation
by WMUs, and developing institutional mechanisms to introduce water service fees in three
of the selected project basins. The Detailed Inter-Agency Action Plan in Annex 1 provides
additional information on implementing BWRM.
3.7         The BWRM  activities would entail institutional development, data base
development, basin operations, water and cost accounting systems, river infrastructure and
facilities management, and training. Basin operations include allocation, O&M of in-stream
facilities, operation of conveyance works, flood forecasting and flood warning systems,
monitoring ambient river water quality and ground water utilization monitoring. Water and
cost accounting systems will help define long-term allocations, utilization, and guidelines for
bulk water service fees.  River infrastructure and facilities management includes river
morphology activities such as bank stability, corridor management, sand excavation, dredging,
estuary maintenance, etc. Vetiver hedge row or other technology for erosion/sediment control
and bank stabilization on flood dikes, canal cuts, drainage channels, and flood plains would
be tested in some basins. Most project costs are incurred for O&M, equipment, and TA under
this component. The project would finance basin planning, incremental real-time operational
expenses, equipment, vehicles, training and consultant services.
3.8         Institutional Framework for BWRM. The proposed organizational structure
(details in Section D of Annex 2) would entail establishing: (a) Provincial Water Management
Committees (PWMC) appointed by the Governors and representing all main water users
including public experts; PWMCs would set forth policies and guidelines for allocation of the
provincial water resources; (b) Basin Water Management Committees (BWMC) or the
equivalent to apply provincial policies to individual basins and act as an advisory and oversight
body to adjudicate and allocate water; and (c) Basin Water Operations Units (BWOUs) to be
responsible for water operations and distribution to service areas, in-stream water quality
monitoring, operational and hydrology data collection and analyses, maintaining the data bases,
basin flood forecasting, warning, and management, and maintenance of infrastructure and in-
stream facilities owned by Public Works. A Ministerial Instruction on establishing PWMCs
was issued in December 1993. A DGWRD Position Paper on Integrated Water Resources
Management was finalized by DGWRD in December 1993, followed by a GOI Strategy Paper
in May 1994. The PWMCs have been established in West, Central and East Java Provinces
and DI Yogyakarta. The membership of the PWMCs, BWMCs and BWOUs and their
functions have been agreed with the Bank. At negotiations assurances were obtained that
(i) the BWMCs or similar committees and BWOUs in each basin selected for real-time water
management would be established by November 1, 1994; and (ii) that the members of the



- 13 -
BWMCs would be jointly appointed by the relevant Governors and Bupatis in the case of
interprovincial basins. It was also agreed at negotiations that BWRM would be implemented
in accordance with the Position Paper, Strategy Paper and Detailed Inter-Agency Action Plan
reviewed and agreed with the Bank.
3.9         Water Quality Management. The BWMC and BWOU would manage the
basin waters to meet both water quantity and quality objectives. Accordingly, BWMC would
allocate water as it judges appropriate, within the constraints of the basin, to meet water quality
objectives set by environmental agencies and would generally monitor ambient water quality.
Some of the basins covered under the project are priorities for the Prokasih (River Pollution
Control) program under BAPPEDAL or other agencies.  The Provincial Bureaus of
Environment Management (BLH) would be represented on the PWMCs. Although improved
sampling of water would occur under the project, detailed testing of water quality and
enforcement of pollution control regulations would remain the responsibilities of the
environmental agencies.
(ii) Hydrology (US$3.5 million, 1.5 percent of base cost).
3.10        In addition to the hydrological activities and equipment specific to BWRM in
the five selected basins, the project would support strengthening of PWRS hydrological units
in West, Central and East Java Provinces and DI Yogyakarta, for systematic collection and
analysis of hydrological data. The project would provide the needed additional equipment,
vehicles, technical assistance and staff training for monitoring and processing of hydrological
data. Some additional stations would be established at key sites. This component would
overcome gaps in data collection and analysis, and further the flood forecasting capability.
Annex 3 details existing hydrological equipment on Java.
(iii) Transfer of Operation and Maintenance of Small Irrigation Schemes to Water Users
Associations or Turnover (US$53.9 million; 23 percent of base cost).
3.11        Area Targets. The project would turnover approximately 356,000 ha under
small (< 500 ha) irrigation schemes to private not-for-profit operators (WUAs) after
conducting special maintenance (SM), where needed. About 50 percent of the area still
remaining for turnover on Java would be turned over to WUAs under the project. The
proposed turnover program is summarized in Table 3.1. The project would finance the costs
of inventory and profiling of systems, WUA formation and development, WUA training, and
design and construction of system improvement, as well as consultancy services for planning,
design and implementation. The program would cover all Java provinces.
3.12        Special Maintenance. SM ensures a well-functioning system before turnover.
For budgetary purposes, SM has been costed at Rp 265,000/ha (base of March 1993 prices),
with a review threshold of Rp 375,000/ha (base of March 1993 prices). Selection of schemes
for SM and design choices can be optimized within the overall average cost limitation.
However, any individual scheme costing more than the review threshold would have to be
justified in terms of economic return, water availability, and design alternatives. An assurance
was obtained at negotiations that the average cost limitation (Rp 265,000/ha) and individual
scheme review threshold (Rp 375,000/ha) and procedures would be observed.
3.13        Design and Construction. Designs would be completed for an additional
80,000 ha to be constructed and turned over after the project. For Central and East Java

Provinces, an additional area of 20 percent for inventory/profiling is budgeted.  SM
construction works related to structures would be undertaken by the project while canal
earthworks would be carried out by WUAs as farmers' equity contribution. An assurance was
obtained from Government that special maintenance would be carried out only on irrigation
schemes where the Borrower has received an assurance from the relevant water users
association that subsequent to the completion of special maintenance, the water users
association would assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of the scheme. After
turnover, PWRS would be available for technical assistance and Public Works has on-going
responsibility for emergency repairs of major hydrological structures.  The annual
implementation schedule for all activities by provinces is detailed in Annex 4. Implementation
would proceed according to Annual Work Programs submitted to the Bank by September 30
of each year for review. The project would finance SM design and construction, WUA
training, and the turnover process.
(iv) Irrigation Development (US$93.2 million; 39 percent of base cost).
3.14        The irrigation development component of the project consists of civil works for
rehabilitation, expansion of schemes larger than 500 ha and a small amount of new irrigation
development and remedial works on the Dumpil system. After detailed analysis, which
depended on the results of earlier Bank-supported projects (EJIP and CWJIP), 220 systems
covering 218,000 ha were selected for potential inclusion in the rehabilitation component
including expansion area. The list of all schemes is available in project files. These were
drawn from a larger universe of schemes covering 312,000 ha which passed preliminary
economic, environmental, cost and water availability tests. This rehabilitation or upgrading
would increase efficiency and cropping intensity and also results in approximately 15,500 ha
of expansion in existing schemes. An assurance was obtained that final selection would depend
on Annual Work Programs (AWP), design checks and confirmation that: (a) water availability
is adequate and dependable (in four out of five years); (b) the estimated ERR of selected
rehabilitation schemes shall be acceptable to the Bank [exceeds 12 percent for schemes costing
more than Rp 1,000,000/ha (US$475) (base March 1993 prices) (excluding sunk costs)];

(c) acceptance of farmers to participate in WUAs, and WUAs preparedness for rehabilitation
and ISF; and (d) Provincial Government statement that the rehabilitated or newly-developed
areas would not undergo planned conversion to alternative uses within a reasonably long time
frame (over 10 years). Design criteria would be imposed to determine eligibility for the AWP.
An assurance was also obtained that after rehabilitation or new construction, all schemes would
be placed under the Efficient Operation and Maintenance program. About 600 ha of new
scheme construction would occur on the Cibareno river close to the southern coast of West
Java. This area might be enlarged if further hydrological analysis proves this to be feasible.
3.15        The Dumpil Irrigation scheme in Central Java was implemented with Bank
support under the West and Central Java Provincial Irrigation Development project (Loan
2649-IND, which was closed June 30, 1993). The sustainability of the project is in danger
because the main and secondary canal systems of Dumpil have suffered serious intermittent
damage due to unstable soil conditions throughout the 11,300 ha project area. Some remedial
works have already been carried out, but additional works comprising canal lining and
retaining walls to the sideslopes, would be required. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that: (a) the project would support the implementation of remedial works, including repairs
on siphons and cross drainage structures, at an estimated cost of US$9.0 million (see Annex
4, Table 2); and (b) no disbursements would be made until the Bank has received acceptable
cost-estimates and design for the works and evidence of adequate availability of irrigation
water to the Dumpil system based on actual measurements of the Lusi river flows.
3.16        Measures to strengthen project quality control through the creation of a Quality
Assurance Office in DGWRD were included under ISSP-Il (Loan 3392-IND). The objective
of the office is to examine contract procedures and quality of design and construction of works,
report findings, identify deficiencies, determine causes and recommend remedial measures.
The office has been established and is functioning satisfactorily. Guidelines and procedures
to strengthen project quality control have been prepared. Technical assistance and operational
support, at an estimated cost of US$1.0 million, would be provided under the project for
another two years starting mid-1995. Total irrigation development under JIWMP would cover
about 230,000 ha (rehabilitation, expansion plus new area and remedial works). Civil works
would be the major cost under this component.
(v) Efricient Operation and Maintenance (EOM); (US$46.6 million; 20 percent of base
cost).
3.17        EOM involves the effective utilization of irrigation and drainage infrastructure
to ensure adequate and equitable water supply to all parts of the system as planned and
maintenance carried out so that the system performs as designed without further rehabilitation.
The objective is an on-going, steady-state O&M regime. The introduction of EOM started in
1987/88 as part of ISSP I, and continued under ISSP II and the ADB-supported Integrated
Irrigation Sector Program (IISP). At the completion of these projects, about 1.25 million ha
of public schemes (outside the Jatiluhur area) on Java, out of 1.56 million ha found in schemes
over 500 ha in size, will be under EOM (Table 3.2). Previous projects have funded the
incremental cost of EOM on rehabilitated schemes versus normal O&M expenditures on a
declining basis for five years. After five years, EOM reverts to the Provincial Budget (APDB)
funding at the appropriate level, with increasing contributions from ISF.



- 16 -
3.18        This project would support EOM on 776,000 ha comprising the remaining years
on 516,000 ha from the earlier projects; 218,000 ha from irrigation development under the
project; and 42,000 ha of recently completed schemes (see Table 3.2). All project support
would be on a declining five-year basis, being reduced by 20 percent per year. Recurrent
O&M costs are covered from GOI provincial (APDB) budgets. Furthermore, it has been
agreed that GOI would bear the full cost of incremental EOM for the five-year period from
the national (APBN) budget rather than utilize Loan proceeds. (It should be noted that EOM
applies to irrigation schemes; the Bank would finance incremental operation expenditures for
real-time basin water management). EOM funding will begin under the project as a routine
program. The Bank would finance other EOM costs, primarily training for EOM, training of
WUAs, and non-vehicle equipment. An assurance was received that GOI would furnish, not
later than July 1 in each year, commencing July 1, 1995, and until completion of the project,
evidence of annual budgetary allocations for the following Fiscal Year through the Directorate
General of Regional Development (and furnish evidence that the budgeted funds were expended
in the previous year), which at least maintain the 1993/94 level of total country-wide irrigation
O&M financing in real terms for all government-controlled schemes not under EOM; and
maintain adequate O&M funding, adjusted for ISF, for the above budget years to sustain EOM
on Java.

(vi) Irrigation Service Fees (US$6 million; 2.5 percent of base cost).
3.19        ISF would strengthen the institutions for irrigation management, increase
beneficiary participation and ensure that adequate resources are provided for EOM on
irrigation systems that are publicly managed, on a "user-pays" basis. Revenue collected from
farmers for ISF reduces the need for government budgetary support and through time will
become the primary source of funds for EOM of the main and secondary distribution systems
larger than 500 ha. The legal basis of ISF is now established in all provinces on Java,
pursuant to MHA decree 39 of 1992, and backed by MHA regulation 12/1992 on WUAs and
the organization of local government agencies. The Government has decided, as a matter of
policy and social equity, to quickly implement ISF throughout the remaining public schemes
on Java. ISF is being expanded under ISSP II and ADB projects to about 700,000 ha on Java.



- 17 -
The total ISF area under the project would, therefore, be about 1.2 million ha, covering the
remainder of Java, or 44 new kabupatens.
3.20        The principles of IFS are payment for O&M services, empowered WUAs which
are the primary collection agents, fees set on needs-based budgets for EOM, and channeling
the proceeds, net of overheads/indivisible, back to the areas where collected. Fees would be
adjusted for the extent of water and services delivery and exemptions would apply in the event
of drought or crop failure. The government role is focused on the district level interface with
the WUAs. Overall management is provided by DGPUOD/MHA. The project would finance
ISF introduction, (procedures, accounting systems, bookkeeping, needs based budget estimation
and water delivery survey), training, administration, and technical assistance to regularize this
activity. The project would strengthen the role of Local Government at Level 1 (supervision)
and Level 2 (implementation and sustained management) and assist WUAs.
3.21        The ISF collection system would be simplified with ISF levies to apply for the
whole tertiary block and WUAs would be empowered and responsible for collection of ISF
from its individual members. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued Guidelines to
Provinces and Districts on collection of ISF, exemptions from ISF, and sanctions for non-
payment of ISF. Through time, over-all O&M funding would need to be reduced in an area
with poor WUA collection performance. Initial ISF is set at Rp 15,000 to 20,000/ha or
40-50 percent of a needs-based estimate of EOM  costs.  The fee would reach about
80-100 percent of EOM costs about five years after introduction. A list of schemes selected
for ISF implementation in 1994/95 had been included in the 1994/95 Annual Work Program
and was reviewed at negotiations. Subsequently, the ISF area would be selected by
Government not later than September 30 in each year, and submitted to the Bank for its review
as part of the Annual Work Program. An assurance to this effect was obtained at negotiations.
The decree to expedite ISF expenditures on EOM through by-passing a cash-flow transaction
at the provincial level, and other measures, was signed (Decree No. 46/1994, dated April 23,
1994). The Ministry of Home Affairs would channel ISF funds back to EOM budgets starting
in FY 1994/95. Annex 11 contains further information on ISF.

PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. PRoJECT Cosms
4.1         Total project cost, including duties, taxes, physical contingencies and price
contingencies, is estimated at US$304.0 million (Rp 639.9 billion), with a foreign exchange
component of about 31 percent or US$95.7 million (Rp 201.5 billion). The cost estimates are
based on the December 1993 exchange rate, and include duties and taxes totalling 9 percent
of base costs, or US$21.0 million. Base costs, without price and physical contingencies, are
US$235.7 million (Rp 496.2 billion). Cost estimates covering about 20 percent of the area for
irrigation rehabilitation works are based on detailed designs and for the rest of the area are
based on costs of similar works recently executed under CWJIP, adjusted for content (e.g.,
excavation, lining, structures etc.). Costs of extension of irrigation systems are based on
CWJIP. Cost of turnover, EOM, and ISF activities are derived from actual costs experienced
in the on-going ISSP II by adjusting these for any changes in methodology, and updating the
unit costs for price increases. Physical contingencies for various categories of works,
equipment, and services vary from 5 to 20 percent, and average 8 percent of total cost. Price
contingencies are calculated from 2.5 percent increases per annum in foreign costs, and
5.5 percent per annum in local costs. The project cost is summarized in Table 4.1 and detailed
in Annex 8.
B. PRoJEcT FINANCING
4.2         The proposed Bank loan of US$165.7 million would finance about 54 percent
of the total project cost, but not EOM, vehicles (US$2.9 million), duties or taxes (US$21.0
million) which will be covered by GOI's budget. The Bank loan would cover foreign
exchange costs and about one-third of the local costs. Water User Association's equity
contribution for SM of turnover schemes, (mainly labor) would be about US$4.5 million
(2 percent). GOI would finance the remaining project cost of US$133.8 million (44 percent)
from its annual budgets. The project financing plan is given in Table 4.2 below.
C. PROCUREMENT
4.3         Sumumary. Procurement of goods other than vehicles, works, and services
would be undertaken by PWRS and DGWRD units (except for DGPUOD units for the ISF
component) at the national and provincial levels in accordance with procedures acceptable to
the Bank. The Bank's standard bidding documents would be used for procurement of goods
and works under ICB. Highlights are: (a) civil works for rehabilitation and turnover are
generally small in scale and subject to LCB with graded levels of GOI approval depending on

equivalent of US$2.0 million or more; (c) vehicles (US$2.9 million) would be provided by
GOI using its own resources; (d) equipment and materials would be procured under ICB if
over US$200,000 (about US$7.5 million) and otherwise through LCB (US$0.9 million);
(e) design engineering services (US$9.6 million, mostly for special maintenance design on
small schemes) would be contracted or subcontracted to local, mostly provincial, firms selected
in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Other consulting services would be

to the Bank. At negotiations an agreement was reached on a schedule for the provision of
vehicles. The procurement arrangement is set out in Table 4.3.
4.4         Civil Works. Procurement of civil works (US$165.6 million) would be
arranged by the project managers (PIMPRO) in each province, except that approvals to
contract awards exceeding Rp 2 billion would have to be obtained from: DGWRD (between
Rp 2.0 billion and 5.0 billion); Minister of PW (between Rp 5.0 and 10.0 billion); or Minister
of Economic Coordination (EKKU-Wasbang) (above Rp 10.0 billion). Any civil works costing
over US$3.0 million would be subject to ICB (US$3.5 million). Domestic preference for
contractors of 7.5 percent may be allowed for works under ICB. Of the 220 contracts for
irrigation development, over half would be below 2.0 billion, perhaps 15 percent between
Rp 2.0 and 5.0 billion, and only a few above Rp 5.0 billion. The Dumpil remedial works
would be grouped in bid packages with a minimum value of US$2.0 million. The remaining
works are small and simple in nature and highly labor-intensive and would have to be
implemented so as to cause minimum disruption to in-season irrigation. They are unlikely to
attract foreign competition, and therefore, would be procured under LCB procedures using a
standard tender document agreed with the Bank at negotiations. Foreign firms would be
allowed to bid for LCB if they are interested. All contracts would be on the basis of unit
rates, and would generally allow an implementation period of 12 months or less. Such
contracts would be let out by April each year so as to enable construction mostly in the dry
season.  For larger irrigation work contracts (costing above Rp 1.0 billion) a longer
implementation period of 18 to 24 months would be allowed. SM works for the schemes to
be turned over (US$45 million) are numerous and simple in nature and require close
interaction with farmers, both as beneficiaries and labor, would be largely tendered on the
basis of LCB procedures using standard tender document agreed with the Bank. These would
be tendered and implemented as a single year contract. In some cases the works would be
undertaken by force account (for a maximum amount of US$18.6 million).
4.5          Equipment, Vehicles and Materials. Vehicles (costing US$2.9 million) would
be procured by GOI, and their supply would be arranged by GOI in accordance with a
schedule agreed at negotiations. Similar types of equipment for River Basin Management,
Hydrology, and Irrigation Development components would be packaged together, and packages
costing above US$200,000 (estimated cost US$7.5 million) would be procured following ICB
procedures and using the Bank's Standard Bidding Document for Goods. Packages costing less
than US$200,000 (total estimated cost US$0.9 million) would be advertised locally, and
procured under LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. For ICB procurement, Indonesian
manufacturers, bidding for equipment and materials contracts, would be allowed a margin of
preference (15 percent of the CIF price or the applicable customs duties, which ever is lower),
if the value added in manufacturing such goods is 20 percent or higher.

4.6          Technical Assistance. A summary of technical assistance is given in Annex 7.
Technical Assistance and Consulting Services under the project total US$29.5 million (without
taxes), or slightly less than 10 percent of total costs. However, about US$9.6 million of
implementation support is for small-scale engineering design services carried out by the private
sector, which is standard DGWRD practice. Net of this amount, TA is about 6 percent of
project costs. Consultants for providing technical assistance for the BWRM and irrigation
components (two packages, total estimated cost US$11.7 million) would generally be joint
ventures between international and national firms, and would be selected after evaluating the
proposals submitted by the short-listed joint venturing groups. The technical assistance support
for preparing Basin Water Resources Plans, estimated to cost US$2.4 million, would be
arranged through a twinning arrangement with a reputed international agency, acceptable to
the Bank. Technical assistance support for the Quality Assurance Office (US$ 1.0 million) and
Technical Audits (US$1.0 million) would be provided through direct appointments or through
joint ventures of international or local firms. Project formulation consultancy for the Phase
II program would be procured in year 3 (Package 7 estimated at US$1.0 million).
Consultancies for project coordination, ISF, and hydrology would probably be direct
appointments. All consultants would be selected in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines and
using the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for Consultants. An assurance was obtained that
bid evaluation and awards for major TA packages (but not Project Formulation) would be
completed by no later than January 15, 1995 (except for ISF, no later than April 1995).
Further information on Technical Assistance is provided in Annex 7.
4.7          Local Engineering Design Services. Technical service packages (total cost
US$9.6 million) related to (i) survey, field investigation, and design of some irrigation
systems; (ii) design of all turnover schemes; and (iii) survey and field investigation (US$1.1
million) of some schemes, which are to be designed either departmentally or by consultants
employed for technical assistance, would probably not be of interest for foreign firms, being
small and scattered. These are expected to be awarded to national consulting firms, after
competitive selection among eligible firms in accordance with procedures acceptable to the
Bank. (This is included under Implementation Support in Table 4.3.)
4.8         Incremental Operational Expenditures. Incremental operational expenditures
(mostly services) for BWRM and training will be carried out under force account and small
contracts. However, some of these expenditures may be subject to LCB.
4.9          Review of Procurement. The Bank would require a prior review of: (a) civil
works contracts costing more than US$500,000 (68 contracts, total cost about US$64.7
million) or 55 percent of Bank-financed civil works; (b) all goods contracts each estimated to
cost above US$200,000 (aggregate cost US$7.5 million or 86 percent of Bank-financed goods);
and (c) all contracts for employment of consulting groups for technical assistance costing
US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals (total cost US$30.5
million including taxes, contingencies and design engineering services).

D. DURSEMETS
4.11             Loan  Coverage.   All project activities are expected  to  be completed  by
June 30, 2000 and the Loan closing date would be December 31, 2000. Disbursements from
the Loan would be made for:
(a)     60 percent of expenditures on civil works;



- 23 -
(b)    100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment and
materials, 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally
manufactured equipment and materials, and 65 percent of locally procured
items; and
(c)   80 percent of expenditures for consultants services and 100 percent of
expenditures for engineering services for PWRS; and
(d)   80 percent of incremental operational expenditures for basin water resources
management and training.
4.12         Disbursements under the project would be made against Statements of
Expenditure (SOE) for small civil works contracts (US$500,000 or less); equipment contracts
valued at US$200,000 or less; and consultant services (including local engineering, survey and
design services) valued at US$100,000 or less for firms and US$50,000 or less for individuals.
SOEs would also be used for the cost of training and operational expenses. Disbursement for
all other expenditures would be on the basis of full documentation. Documentation for SOE
expenditures would be retained by implementing agencies and the Directorate General of
Budget (Ministry of Finance) and be made available for inspection by Bank supervision
missions. Annex 10 contains the Disbursement Plan.
4.13         Conditions.  As a condition of disbursement against the civil works
expenditures for rehabilitation of schemes placed on a deferred list for environmental reasons,
the Government would obtain prior approval from the Bank of design, environmental impacts,
and economic analysis (para. 6.7) of the three projects on the deferred list. A second
condition of disbursement is against the Dumpil remedial works expenditures. The Bank
would have to receive (a) costs estimates and designs for the remedial works acceptable to the
Bank; and (b) evidence, satisfactory to the Bank, of adequate water availability for the Dumpil
Irrigation system, based on actual measurements of Lusi river flows, before authorizing
disbursements against Dumpil expenditures (para. 3.15).
4.14         Special Account. A Special Account with an initial deposit of US$7 million
would be established in Bank Indonesia. This account should be maintained by the Director
General of Budget (DG Budget) in the Ministry of Finance. The Special Account would be
used for all eligible local and foreign expenditures under the project. This account will be
replenished on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used,
whichever occurs first.
E. AccouNrs AND AuDrrs
4.15         Background. For all implementing agencies, each accounting section is headed
by a qualified accountant who reports monthly on budget and financial status. Separate
detailed accounts are kept by DGWRD, DGPUOD and each PWRS for each budget item by
project and budget year. Internal audit sections visit project areas quarterly and examine local
accounting records. Accounting procedures now in place are adequate to support SOE
applications. Final accounts, including consolidated receipts and expenditures statements, are
prepared at year end and meet Bank requirements. DGWRD will take the lead in preparing
consolidated statements. Project accounts are subject to two audits: (a) by the Inspector
General of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW); and (b) by the Financial and Development



- 24 -
Supervisory Board (BPKP). The work of both auditors has been found to be generally
satisfactory on Bank-assisted irrigation projects.
4.16        Accounts. It was agreed that Government would cause each national and
provincial executing agency to: (a) establish and maintain adequate and separate accounts from
the beginning of project implementation; and (b) maintain such accounts in accordance with
sound and generally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank,
so as to enable these agencies to provide annual financial statements that reflect the financial
performance and status of project components. In addition, assurances were obtained that
Government would:
(a)   keep all project related contracts, documents related to the SOEs, and orders
and receipts for at least one year after the Bank has received the audit report
for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the loan account was
made;
(b)   maintain the Special Account, including records and documentation of the
withdrawals, as deemed satisfactory by the Bank;
(c)   complete consolidated annual financial statements of the project for independent
audit within six months of the close of each Government fiscal year;
(d)   undertake independent audits of each year's project consolidated accounts,
including the audits of SOEs and the Special Account, and then submit such
audit reports to the Bank within nine months of the close of each Government
fiscal year; and
The budgetary/accounting advisor in the Project Coordination Unit would assist DGWRD in
establishing/monitoring the consolidated project accounting systems, including financial
statements, balance sheets, and income statements, in accordance with Government regulations
and procedures.
4.17        Technical Audits. About 45 percent of the contracts under the project would
be awarded without prior review by the Bank. The expenditures related to these contracts
would be disbursed in accordance with the Bank's Statement of Expenditures (SOE)
procedures.  Technical audits of project activities, including contracting procedures,
construction of works, supply of equipment and the delivery of services, would be initiated by
DGWRD and DGPUOD, with special emphasis on contracts not subject to prior review by the
Bank. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that: (a) terms of reference and proposed
organizational arrangements for carrying out these technical audits would be prepared and
furnished to the Bank for comments by June 1, 1995; (b) such audits would be carried out
annually starting not later than April 1, 1996; and (c) copies of the annual technical audit
reports would be furnished to the Bank with the first ones due October 1, 1996. Technical
assistance and operational support, estimated to cost US$1.0 million, for the carrying out of
the technical audits have been provided under the project for this purpose.

ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT,
AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. SUmmARY
5.1         An assurance was obtained that the project would be implemented in accordance
with the Irrigation Policy Statement (1987), DGWRD's Integrated Water Resources
Management Position Paper, GOI's Strategy Paper on Integrated Water Resources
Management, and Detailed Inter-Agency Action Plans reviewed and agreed with the Bank.
The project would be implemented in the East and West and Central Java Provinces and DI
Yogyakarta. The overall organization is similar to that used under ISSP II (Loan 3392-IND).
DGWRD would be responsible for project implementation, supervision and coordination/
planning. The Ministry of Home Affairs, DGPUOD, would continue to be responsible for the
implementation of the ISF program, with provincial and local level government involvement.
5.2         The role of the WUAs in implementation of ISF is critical and they are
supported by the project. The Bureau of Water Resources and Irrigation in BAPPENAS would
chair periodic review meetings with concerned Ministries. The proposed organizational
structure for river basin water resources management is outlined in Annex 2. The framework
relies on Provincial and Basin Water Management Committees, responsible to provincial
governors, and Basin Water Operations Units. A detailed Implementation Volume has been
prepared for the project.
5.3         At negotiations an assurance was obtained that coordination and review of
project implementation would be provided by the Project Coordinating Unit led by a Project
Coordinator to be appointed on a full-time basis under the Director, DPP (Bina Program). This
function would be assisted by a Project Coordination and Advisory Technical Assistance
consultancy (Annex 7). The TOR for the coordination consultancy has been reviewed and
agreed. Technical Assistance for BWRM (Planning and Real Time), Turnover, and Irrigation
Development would be regionalized and the TORs have been finalized and agreed. The
Institute of Hydraulic Engineering (IHE) in Bandung would be assigned to assist the Provincial
Hydrological Units responsible for hydrological services. DGWRD would review and develop
water priorities and rights and would develop corresponding guidelines for water allocation.
In carrying out the Hydrology, Turnover, Irrigation Development and EOM components under
the project, an assurance was obtained that the PWRS' in the project area would assume the
functions of Project Management and Project Implementation in each province, with qualified
staff in adequate numbers.
5.4         Selection of consultancy services (except ISF) and equipment would be
undertaken by DGWRD. DGPUOD would conduct procurement for the ISF component.



- 26 -
However, tendering for the design and construction of civil works for SM and EOM would
be the responsibility of the PWRS in the provinces.
5.5          Project management would be undertaken by managers (PIMPROS) assigned
to various project components. The assignment of PIMPROS was reviewed at negotiation, and
would include one for basin plans (subdirector P2WS in DPP/DGWRD), and one for real-time
water resources management in each project basin. A PIMPRO would be assigned to the ISF
component by the Bupati in each District, and one assigned in each Province to the irrigation
components (rehabilitation, Dumpil remedial works, turnover, EOM).
5.6         The Bupati at the District Level would implement ISF with DGPUOD support.
Implementation responsibility for irrigation SM and EOM would remain with the PWRS,
primarily acting through its field sections (cabang dinas Pengairan) and lower levels (ranting
dinas and subranting). The Annual Work Program (AWP), which would cover all project
components, would be a key project implementation mechanism. Project implementing
agencies would prepare the AWP for their components which would be collated at the central
level by the Coordinating Unit within DGWRD. The AWP and Budget for the first year of
implementation (1994/1995) was reviewed and agreed at negotiations. AWPs for fiscal year
1995/96 onwards would be submitted to the Bank not later than September 30 in each year,
for review, to cover the ensuing Government's fiscal year beginning April 1. The criteria
upon which the Bank's review and concurrence of the AWP would be based are: the adequacy
of AWPs for achieving project objectives consistent with the requirements of the Loan
Agreement, particularly its adherence with the agreed Action Program (Annex 1); and the
adequacy of programs in providing physical, financial and manpower resources to implement
and sustain the targets set for the ensuing project year. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that these arrangements would be followed by Government. A Computerized
Project Management (CPM) schedule appears in Annex 13 and further implementation details
are available in project files.
5.7          DGWRD, as the key implementing agency, would be responsible for preparing
semi-annual project progress reports, annual monitoring and evaluation reports and a project
completion report within six months of the Loan closing. A mid-term review (MTR) of the
project would be conducted with concerned agencies and the Bank (January 1997). During the
MTR an assessment would be made of the operational aspects and effectiveness of the water
allocation plans developed for the river basins under the project. The Bank supervision plan
for the proposed project is included in Annex 12.
B. IMPLEMENTATION OF BASIN WATER REsOuRcEs MANAGEmiENT
5.8          Basin Water Resources Management in its planning aspect would be
implemented by a multi-disciplinary staff at DGWRD's Directorate of Planning and
Programming (DPP). In later years the government would decentralize planning to the
provinces. Real-time BWRM would be implemented by PWRS with the Basin Water
Operations Units. The water allocation, drainage, and flood control operations would follow
guidelines established by the respective PWMCs and procedures described by the BWMCs.
Annex 2 discusses various aspects of the BWRM approach and implementation.



- 27 -
C. INMPMETATION OF TuRNOVER COMPONENT
5.9         Design criteria and guidelines for turnover special maintenance (SM) works
prepared under ISSP II would be generally used for the project. Standard documents and
designs will be used to expedite administrative/contractual procedures and to ensure that the
systems are not too complex or costly for farmer management. WUAs would carry out canal
earthworks as farmer's equity contribution. SM design works would be undertaken by local
consulting firms under the oversight of PWRS. For rapid implementation start-up, the first
year's construction (1995/96) would be based on designs already prepared under ISSP II (Loan
3392-IND). Designs would be completed for an additional 398,000 ha, leaving 80,000 ha to
be constructed after the completion of the project. Local conditions would dictate the share
of construction to be carried out by contractors, force account or WUAs. (he latter would
concentrate on earth works).  Annex 4 contains further information on the turnover
implementation schedule and phasing details are available in project files.
D. IMLEMENTAnON OF REHABILITATION
5.10        Preliminary selection of schemes for rehabilitation was based on cost, expected
return, environmental impact, possibility of interconnection, water availability and exemption
from  floods.  Final selection for construction would depend on additional conditions
(para. 3.14). In particular, schemes costing more than Rp 1,000,000/ha (US$475) (base price
of March 1993) would be required to have an estimated ERR > 12 percent, excluding sunk
costs. The distribution of selected schemes is approximately 69,000 ha in West Java, 39,000
ha in Central Java, and 109,000 ha in East Java. Designs covering about 80,000 ha are
already available (35 percent of the total). Utilizing these designs would allow a quick
commencement and smooth phasing of construction. Additional design work would be carried
out by Provincial Design Groups (these were established in three provinces under the earlier
Bank-supported EJIP and CWJIP projects and would handle 20 percent of the total),
provincially managed local consultants (25 percent of new designs) and consultants hired under
a TA package (55 percent-65 percent). All construction would be arranged through contracts
awarded under competitive bidding, usually one contract per system. (Chapter 4 discusses
procurement.)  Annex 4 contains data on the phasing and distribution of design and
construction activities for rehabilitation.  Annex 9 contains a description of expected
rehabilitation works on each scheme in the project. Additional data on each scheme can be
found in project files.
E. IMPLEMENTATION OF IRGATION SERVICE FEES
5.11        ISF would be implemented as under ISSP II (Loan 3392-IND).  During
introduction, there would be a review of conditions, including an area inventory, tenure
records, and an assessment of tertiary gates, diversion structures, canal lengths between gates,
number of water users per tertiary turnout, relationship to plot owners, holding size, and WUA
structure and membership. Pre-implementation activities entail a system walk-through, plan
of O&M, formulation of needs-based budget, and service agreement.  The stages of
implementation are the listings of planted area, payment advice, list of harvested areas, final
assessment bills to the WUAs, and fee collection. Oversight of ISF is provided by DGPUOD.
PWRS would support the inventory of works stage. Actual implementation would occur at the
district level and collection from farmers would be through WUAs. The Ministry of Home



- 28 -
Affairs has issued Decree No. 98, (July 1993) on the Technical Procedures for Irrigation
Service Fees which provide details on the principles, policies, implementation mechanism and
guidelines for ISF. This document would be the basis of ISF implementation under this
project. (Copy in project files.) Further information on ISF may be found in Annex 11.
F. MANAGEMENr OF TECHNCAL ASsrANCE
5.12        Consultants for River Basin Planning, Project Formulation and Project
Coordination would be under DPP/DGWRD.   Technical Assistance for Irrigation
Development, Turnover and Dumpil Remedial Works would be managed by PWRS in each
province, but contracted by DOI-I/DGWRD centrally. Support for the Quality Assurance
Office would be contracted by DGWRD. Proposals for the institutional arrangements and
management of possible TA for technical audits are due by June 1, 1995. The Hydrology
Consultancy would be contracted by DGWRD and would work through the PRWS. The

PROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACT
A. AssumpnoNs FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.1         Economic and financial analyses were conducted on irrigation development
comprising rehabilitation, expansion and turnover schemes on a 30-year horizon using 1993
constant prices, and based on rice cultivation. These components account for 60 percent of
base costs including the share of EOM for schemes developed or rehabilitated under the
project. A number of project components, e.g., basin water resources management and
planning, hydrology, ISF introduction and EOM generate benefits not amenable to ERR
modeling. However, EOM costs within rehabilitated, expanded, or new schemes were
included in the ERR analysis. (Mhe project supports EOM in areas not rehabilitated under the
project as well, and ERRs were not calculated on these expenditures.) Per hectare crop models
and farm budgets were developed assuming market prices for unskilled labor (about 50 percent
of inputs), world market prices for fertilizer and the average of projected import and export
parity prices for rice. If current market prices persist, these projections, derived in early 1993,
would underestimate realized rice price levels and project benefits. Project costs were taken
to be: Rp 1,000,000/ha (US$475) for rehabilitation and Rp 265,000 for special maintenance
prior to turnover. Incremental farming costs differentiate expansion of systems from cropping
intensity increases and include higher inputs proportional to yield and area increases. Yield
assumptions for rehabilitation were for the wet season, 5 percent increase if starting below
4.25 t/ha; dry season 5 percent (initial yield 4.75 t/ha) to 15 percent (initial yield of 3.75 t/ha).
Dry season cropping intensities for rehabilitation are expected to rise between 5 percent (if
starting at 75 percent) to 15 percent (if beginning at 25 percent). No yield increases were
assumed for SM on turnover schemes; benefits were derived from 25 percent intensity
increases versus accumulating intensity losses in the absence of SM. Financial, incremental
EOM expenses are valued at Rp 10,000 to Rp 20,000/ha (if prior irrigation) and Rp 37,000/ha
(no prior irrigation). It was further assumed that without the EOM regime, irrigated area
would be lost at the rate of 0.5 percent per year, or 15 percent over thirty years, due to
inadequate maintenance. Further details are available in Annex 14 and project files.
B. PROJEcT BENEFITS AND JUSTFCATION
6.2          Economic and FMnancial Benefits of Irrigation Development. Incremental
crop production of about 450,000 metric tons expected from the project can be attributed to
improved crop yields, higher cropping intensities and salvage area (avoidance of area reduction
through better maintenance). With and without project analysis of farm income indicates that
net annual farm income would be boosted by 5 percent to 23 percent depending on
circumstances (or Rp. 100,000-200,000/ha). The largest benefits would occur where existing
yields and intensities are low. Sixteen ERRs were calculated for rehabilitation depending on
initial yields and cropping intensities (four cases each) which ranged from 11 percent to



- 30 -
21 percent. Specific characteristics of approximately 220 project schemes, which passed the
preliminary economic analysis, were placed in the ERR matrix resulting in a frequency
distribution. About 8 percent of the schemes were marginal (ERR around 12 percent) and
would be subject to additional review during implementation. Average ERRs were 17 percent
for rehabilitation, 19 percent for expansion and 15 percent for special maintenance prior to
turnover. The weighted average ERR for irrigation development was 16.6 percent. The
irrigation component and a relevant share of EOM account for about 62 percent of total project
base costs.
6.3          Sensitivity Analysis. ERRs remain above 12 percent for rehabilitation even
if costs rise by 50 percent or rice prices fall by 20 percent. ERRs are preserved for turnover
schemes with 25 percent higher costs or 10 percent rice price declines. As noted above,
current rice prices have moved well above base forecast values. Returns are also sensitive to
the life of the benefit stream, discussed in the sustainability and risks section.
6.4         Project Justification. The project would rehabilitate or expand 218,000 ha of
irrigated area; carry out remedial works on 11,300 ha; provide special maintenance to 356,000
ha of small systems before handing O&M over to WUAs; extend the efficient operation and
maintenance program so that total coverage would reach over 90 percent of larger irrigation
systems on Java; and introduce Irrigation Service Fees linked to needs-based EOM budgets in
all remaining public irrigation schemes on Java. The project would promote user participation
and responsibility through WUAs and ISF thereby helping to shape system care and
maintenance and taking government out of the business of managing hundreds of small
systems. Well over a million small-holder farm families would benefit from rehabilitation and
special maintenance of systems serving farms which average less than 0.5 ha in size.
Incremental rice production is estimated to be 450,000 tons annually after implementation.
Expenditures for EOM sustain operations, protect valuable infrastructure and avoid the need
for additional rehabilitation.
6.5          The project also reaches beyond irrigation to introduce innovations in integrated
water resources management in recognition of growing and competing demands from municipal
and industrial users. The 12 percent of project costs allocated to planning, basin water
resources management and hydrology would guide investment, improve real-time operational
efficiency and provide policies, institutions and a model for resolving allocation issues which
can be replicated in other basins. The project sets the stage for water delivery, drainage and
flood control, and bulk water charges through cost and water accounting systems which will
ultimately contribute to cost-recovery, efficiency and conservation. Improved flood forecasting
and warning systems, better drainage, river structure maintenance, and erosion control have
unquantifiable, but tangible and evident benefits.
C. INSrITUrlONAL AND ENvIRoNMETAL IMAcr
6.6         Institutional and Policy Development.  The project re-activates and
strengthens the role of Water Users Associations in allocation and service fee collection. It
creates provincial and basin water management committees and water management units in a
number of basins, and supports Provincial Water Resource Services. It would train PWRS
staff in the use of basin models, real-time water management and operational and hydrological
data analysis. Training would also be provided to WUAs for ISF and EOM introduction. The
river maintenance component would set standards for in-stream structure maintenance. Policy



- 31 -
development would emphasize decentralization, channeling ISF back to basins, and integrated
water resources management.
6.7         Environmental Impact.  This project is placed in a "B" environmental
category. Negative environmental impacts are minimal. Most of the project is directed to
existing cultivated and irrigated areas.  Preliminary environmental analysis eliminated
38,000 ha from consideration. Specific environmental issues have been raised in three out of
approximately 220 schemes-Rawa Jabung, Leewigoong, and Waduk Gondang-under
Preliminary Environmental Analyses (PILs). The first two would require a full environmental
analysis (AMDAL or a supplementary study) and additional economic justification; the last
would have to address siltation and some compensation issues prior to proceeding. At
negotiations a disbursement condition was agreed upon that these three would be placed on a
deferred list and would require Bank approval before proceeding with construction under the
project, based on further analysis of design, cost, benefit, and environmental impact. An
Environmental Assessment Report for the entire project is available in project files. On the
positive side, the project would promote water quality sampling, place provincial
environmental bureaus on provincial water management committees, and introduce vetiver
hedge row or other hedge row grass technology to control erosion and sedimentation. It would
support a public awareness campaign to heighten the understanding of conservation and
pollution objectives. Approximately Rp 1 billion has been allocated for environmental
management and monitoring.
6.8         Resettlement. Assurances were obtained that resettlement would be avoided
or minimized under the project. If resettlement is unavoidable in some areas (which is possible
in connection with rehabilitated or expanded irrigation schemes) before carrying out the works,
the Borrower would: (i) prepare a resettlement plan for affected individuals in accordance with
policies, planning principles, institutional arrangements and design criteria agreed with the
Bank; and (ii) design resettlement so as to improve the living standards of those resettled.
Further, the resettlement plan would be submitted to the Bank for approval and measures to
ensure resettlement follow plans approved by the Bank would be taken.
D. SumTAINABIIITY AND RISKS
6.9          Sustainability. The purpose of the EOM component is to fund needs-based
O&M budgets and ensure that further rehabilitation is not needed. This is a key project feature
comprising 20 percent of base costs and is reflected in loan conditions on government
financing. Government agreement not to use loan proceeds for EOM funding and to introduce
farmer-paid ISF on a Java-wide basis demonstrates commitment to sustainability. Bringing
systems up to the level justifying entry into EOM is the objective of rehabilitation and
upgrading on larger schemes. Special maintenance in small service areas is also directed to
sustainability. Conversion of land out of agricultural production is one threat to sustainability
and sensitivity analysis shows that shorter benefit streams severely drive down ERRs.
Assurances were obtained that land use planning would not permit conversion of rehabilitated
areas to non-agricultural use for over 10 years.
6.10        Risks and Risk Mitigation. Institutional, technical, and economic risks exist;
environmental risks are minimal. The WUAs are very important for the implementation of
EOM, collection of ISF, turnover of smaller irrigation schemes, and for improvement of water
distribution and management at the farm level. The quality of WUA development and training,



- 32 -
including social and community preparation, must be adequate to minimize risks. ISF
collection could be difficult. The WUA emphasis on collection responsibility and having MHA
issue an advisory/guidelines on collection will bolster the performance of ISF collection.
Success depends on improved delivery of services after rehabilitation, channeling collected ISF
back to irrigation schemes facilitated by decrees to streamline this process and reasonable fees
geared to needs-based budgets, with exemptions for crop-failure and non-delivery of water.
6.11         The government needs to maintain commitment to the integrated water resources
management process and institutions. Here favorable outcomes require provincial cooperation
and beneficiary participation. Recent decrees and policy development demonstrate serious GOI
commitment. Technical risks are minimal considering that the proposed technologies have
been tested and proven elsewhere. A number of irrigation schemes proposed for rehabilitation
will still require feasibility studies and preparation of detailed designs prior to implementation.
The project can further minimize technical risks by: (a) careful screening and selection of the
planned irrigation schemes; and (b) providing special attention to quality control, monitoring
and evaluation of the technical performance. Technical audits are also required. Economic
viability largely depends on containing investment and production costs, achieving the expected
benefits in a timely fashion, and rice prices. Preliminary economic analysis is quite favorable.
Returns are fairly robust against adverse changes in production costs and rice prices, except
for rice prices in some turnover models. Higher rehabilitation cost (over Rp 1,000,000/ha or
US$475/ha) would be subjected to additional economic justification, as would special
maintenance above the review threshold. Implementation phasing is designed to minimize
disruption of farming and accelerate the beginning of benefit streams.

(h)   Annual Work Programs. Work programs and cost estimates of Project
activities to be carried out during the following Fiscal Year would be furnished
not later than September 30 in each year, commencing November 30, 1994,
and until completion of the Project. Each Work Program would be carried out
taking into account the Bank's comments (paras. 3.13, 3.21 and 5.6).
(i)   Technical Audits. Technical audits of project activities would be carried out
in accordance with terms of reference and organizational arrangements to be
furnished to the Bank for comments not later than June 1, 1995; such technical
audits would be carried out annually during the implementation of project,
commencing not later than April 1, 1996; copies of such audits would be
provided to the Bank annually, commencing not later than October 1, 1996
(para. 4.17).
(j)    Resettlement. Resettlement would be avoided or minimized under the project.
If resettlement is unavoidable in some areas before carrying out the works,
Government would: (i) prepare a resettlement plan for affected individuals in
accordance with policies, planning principles, institutional arrangements and
design criteria agreed with the Bank; and (ii) design resettlement so as to
improve the living standards of those resettled. Further, the resettlement plan
would be submitted to the Bank for approval and measures to ensure
resettlement follow plans approved by the Bank would be taken (para. 6.8).
(k)   Project Coordination and Management. A Project Coordination Unit within
DGWRD would be maintained until completion of the Project, with terms of
reference and qualified staff in adequate numbers, including a Project
coordinator, who shall be the head of the Unit and report to the Director of
DPP in DGWRD. In carrying out the Hydrology, Turnover, Irrigation



- 35 -
Development and EOM components under the Project the PWRSs in the Project
Area would carry out the functions of Project management and Project
Implementation in each province with qualified staff in adequate numbers
(para. 5.3).
B. CONDMONS OF DISBuRSEMENT
7.2   (a)   As a condition of loan disbursement against civil works expenditures (excluding
survey, design and investigation) for rehabilitation of three schemes placed on
a deferred list for environmental reasons, Government would obtain prior
approval from the Bank of design, costs, benefits and environmental impact of
these schemes (paras. 4.13 and 6.7).
(b)   As a condition of disbursement against the Dumpil remedial works
expenditures, the Bank would receive and approve: (i) cost estimates and
designs for the remedial works; and (ii) evidence of adequate water availability

INDONESIA
JAVA IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT AND WATER
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
River Basin Water Resources Management Component
A. General
1.           DGWRD has recently issued, and the Bank has accepted, a Position Paper on Integrated
Water Resources Management (December, 1993), followed in May, 1994 by a GOI Strategy Paper on
the same subject to improve the management of the nation's natural resources. These are of particular
consequence to sustainable water resources development and management (WRDM) in the next twenty
five (1994 to 2019) years Development Program (PJPT II). GOI will launch the preparation of spatial
plans in the key provinces, linking water and land use through river basin (SWS) plans, to guide long
term and current activities. It will focus water management at the basin level. And it will deconcentrate
and decentralize decisions and activities to the extent possible by directly engaging the beneficiaries and
delegating more responsibilities to local entities.
2.            A series of workshops in 1992, held under the auspices of BAPPENAS and MPW, and
the Cisarua International Water Seminar (November 1992) focussed on WRDM policy options and
strategy for the long term. The proceedings of the Cisarua Seminar have been published under four
topics: Institutional Aspects of Sustainable Water Resources Development; Water Resources Allocation
and Management; Water Resources Development Policy and Strategy; and Human Resources
Development. Recently, GOI has initiated steps on institutional adjustments essential for integrated
WRDM. It has created a separate Bureau of Water Resources and Irrigation in BAPPENAS under the
Deputy Chairman Infrastructure.
3.            Aspects, primarily pertaining to river basin water operations, were introduced earlier in
ISSP-II. These comprised pilot real-time basin operations in two basins: Opak (Yogyakarta) and
Cisanggarung (West and Central Java). These endeavors will be expanded under the proposed project
in three more basins on Java, and will include other features of the referenced GOI policies. Details of
selected river basins are given in table I at the end of this Annex. The River Basin Water Resources
Management (RBWM) component would focus on two elements of integrated basin water resources
management: (i) long-term basin water resources planning and management and (ii) real-time water
management and operations. Item (i) will entail preparation of basin water resources plans (BWRP) in
three basins. Item (ii) will introduce important aspects of real-time operations by carefully tailoring the
interdependent institutional and physical arrangements and activities to be more effective, yet practical
under the existing situations in the basins.
4.            The adopted concepts and programs would facilitate a full transition from today's situation
to the ultimate basin arrangements over a suitable period of time. They will reflect the Indonesian



- 45 -                            ANNEX 2
experience in these areas and information on concepts pertaining to these elements applied successfully
elsewhere. Basic to formnulating the overall basin water resources management arrangements is the clear
understanding of the inter-relationships and the independencies of the two elements mentioned in para.
3 above. A diagram of Basin Water Resources Management appears in chart 1 this Annex. In particular,
the fundamental differences between these two elements in the level of decisions, the skills to be applied
and the time frames involved in the decisions, not only allow simplifying the overall institutional
arrangements, but also the schedule for implementing the respective activities. These are discussed in
Sections B and C below.
B. Basin Water Resources Planning Sub-Component
5.            River basin master plans of limited scope were prepared for several basins a number of
years ago. These, however, were neither comprehensive nor of sufficient detail to guide government
programs and have rarely been up-dated. Much of the irrigation development in Java is based on these
plans. A review and updating of the available basin master plans, with a cross-sectoral focus and within
a framework of current regional planning objectives, has become necessary especially as the economy
in Java has changed significantly during the last two decades. Comprehensive plans are also essential to
integrate long-term and real-time water resources management. In order to develop a solid foundation
of staff skills, methodology and supporting data collection programs for conducting such work, basin plan
preparation will initially focus on a limited number of basins.
Purpose and Content of Basin Water Resources Plans
6.            A Basin Water Resources Plan (BWRP), would be prepared on two of the basins:
Ciujung-Cidurian (West Java) and Jratunseluna (Central Java) in which real-time operations will be
introduced under JIWMP and Citarum, where significant work on improving water management has been
completed. The BWRPs would: (i) document the present situation, (ii) define the basin resources, (iii)
set out future demands on the resources projected at 10, 25 and 50 year time horizons, (iv) outline
alternatives to meet these demands and (v) describe the currently adopted/proposed programs and projects
intended to meet the demands. The BWRP would be updated whenever major decisions are made that
affect the resources with a maximum interval of five years.
7.            The primary purpose of the BWRP is to assure effective guidance and coordination of
the many governrnent and private sector activities in the basin.  In particular, it will allow the
government to evaluate and schedule its investments and institute essential programs in a timely basis.
It will provide the long term framework for the evolving real-time basin water operations activities (as
would commence in four of the basins under JIWMP and partially in place in the Citarum). The BWRP
would be formulated in consultation with the respective Provincial BAPPEDAs and concerned GOI
agencies. Spatial planning in the involved provinces would be initiated at the same time. Initially it
would be sufficient to document: (i) the nation's goals and objectives that bear on resources planning
(social, economic, regional development, security, and environmental), (ii) the demographic and economic
projections for the basins designated for preparation of a BWRP and (iii) any intentions of diverting water
into or out of these basins. These would be documented as a Provincial Framework Water Plan for the
concerned provinces.



- 46 -                            ANNEX 2
Approach to the Preparation of the Basin Water Resources Plan
8.            An initial BWRP document would be completed by the end of year two of the project.
This would utilize the available information and adopted methodologies to prepare all sections of a full
plan to the extent possible. As a consequence, it would provide an early description of the general
situation and specific problems and issues that confront the government in the long-term management of
the basin's resources.  It also will prove out the planning approach, means of execution and any
inadequacies in available data and in the organization's capabilities. The BWRPs will not focus
extensively on institutions, except on the impacts of existing laws and any new legislation that would be
required. Any proposed institutional changes and organizational structure can be discussed in separate
documents to avoid distractions from the resources planning.
9.            The BWRPs would be prepared by a core multi-disciplinary staff at the DGWRD's
Directorate of Planning and Programming (DPP). The sub-directorate of water resources planning
(P2WS) in the DPP would be strengthened in order to prepare in-house such plans, and to enhance the
ability of DPP/DGWRD to monitor such plans. This will best assure the assembly and effective use of
the required specialized talents, the timely input of other government agencies and the creation of a
permanent self-sufficient capability within DGWRD.  The preparation of the many BWRPs and
subsequent five-year up-dating necessitates a small, yet highly qualified, permanent section for this task.
In later years the government would decentralize the long-term BWRP to the provinces.
10.          The sub-directorate of water resources planning/DPP would carry full responsibility for
the execution of the planning efforts through utilizing the assistance of outside experts working as
counter-part staff, as necessary. The plan preparation responsibility would not be passed to a consultant
on a task concept. A great number of existing DGWRD staff have been trained in the areas of expertise
required and would be reassigned. Their early identification and assignment to the sub-dit P2WS will
allow tailoring the outside assistance to the actual needs. It is anticipated that about ten (10) highly
trained individuals permanent to the DPP, assisted by various short-term government specialists and no
more than three long-term, perhaps a total of 48 staff-months, and various short-term outside experts,
total of 42 staff-months, would be required to undertake the plan preparation mentioned in para. 6. The
permanent staff would provide the continuity and the foundation for subsequent programs in other
provinces and basins. The outside experts would participate over a two year period. They would be
recruited through a bilateral twinning arrangement, satisfactorily to the Bank, with an internationally
reputed agency.
C. REAL-TIME BASIN WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (BWRM) SuB-ComPoNENT
General
11.          Shortages, worsening pollution and the Java's rapidly expanding economy dictate that the
day-to-day management of the water resources in critical basins be improved as rapidly as possible. As
was noted earlier, efforts to accomplish this were introduced, on a pilot basis, in the Opak and
Cisanggarung basins under ISSP-II. Though these efforts were delayed, much has been learned that will



- 47-                              ANNEX 2
help devise better approaches for establishing real-time water management under this project.  In this
context, real-time means that conditions are monitored and managed at hourly intervals for flood flows
and, initially, at daily or weekly intervals for normal basin water operations.'
12.           Real-time Water Resources Management (BWRM), would be introduced in three basins:
Ciujung/Cidurian (West Java), Jratunseluna/Garang (Central Java) and Sampean (East Java), and
expanded to the same level in Opak and Cisanggarung basins. The primary project tasks would be
conducted by the respective PWRS or MPW units with broadly applicable support tasks and overall
guidance by DGWRD. The support tasks by DGWRD entail drafting of allocation policies, guidelines
and water rights (or priorities) descriptions that are to be refined or adopted as policies by the individual
provincial Water Resources Committees and Basin Water Boards to be discussed later.
BWRM Obiectives and the Activities
13.           The objective of BWRM will be to attain efficient, reliable day-to-day management of
the basin's water resources. This would entail the control and delivery of bulk water supplies; water
distribution to service areas and bulk users; operation of primary hydraulic infrastructure; water quality
management; storm and major agricultural drainage; maintenance of a healthy river environment and
flood control. Several of the uses may conflict, thus necessitating a formal allocation of water among
users and overseeing all activities that may effect the resources and river channels. BWRM involves both
operational control and regulatory enforcement in all these areas. It requires site-specific services and
the measurement of those services. Under water supply operations, it entails water allocation and the
water delivery to fulfill those allocations. Under flood control, it entails warning areas in danger and
flow  control/containment.  Under the environmental objective, it entails in-stream  water quality
management through maintenance of adequate flows. Maintenance of infrastructure facilities and natural
river channels is paramount to sustain all services. And funding -- through government budgets or user
payments -- must be fully adequate to support both the efficient operations and the timely maintenance
of the system facilities and river channels. The environmental regulatory function resides today in the
Center and provincial environmental units, separate from the operations entities. This arrangement will
not affect the physical operations as the regulatory bodies will retain responsibilities to set and enforce
standards, including water quality.
Characteristics of Physical Facilities and Associated Activities
14.           The principal activity in BWRM is the day-to-day "water operations". The key physical
features involved are the mainstream storage facilities and natural channels; the in-stream diversion
structures and conveyance works to deliver to the service areas (dictated by the hydraulic/hydrologic
network boundaries) and the service area channels and control structures. The water operations entail:
the allocation of supplies; the scheduling, operation and monitoring of the mainstream facilities and
in-stream diversion structures; the operation of the primary conveyance works to transfer water to service
areas distant from the main rivers or remove excess water from service areas; and the
I Additional information on the results of the ISSP II (Loan 3392-IND) pilot river basin
program are available in Project Files.



-48-                              ANNEX 2
distribution/collection of water within the service areas. The basin size and the configuration of the
primary features will determine the organizational structure and assignment of operational (and
maintenance) responsibilities. The proposed institutional arrangements suitable for the BWRM in the
selected basins are described in Section D below.
D. Institutional Arrangements
Basin Organizational and Responsibilities for Water Operations
15.          There is a need for a generic organizational structure which best complies with the
physical operational dictates of the basin, satisfies the Indonesian government's longer term
decentralization objectives and facilitates the transition from today's arrangements to tomorrow's, initially
under the co-management concept. This would provide one unit responsible for all O&M of primary
basin facilities and basin level water operations. Local entities would be responsible for O&M of local
service areas including, ultimately also, the irrigation system O&M and water management by Dinas
Pengairan TK II, as envisioned in MHA Decree 39/1992.
16.          A Basin Water Operations Unit (BWOU) would have responsibilities for the operations
and maintenance of the main river channels, flood levees, reservoirs (except hydro-power whose releases
they would monitor and coordinate) and major diversions, and in large basins, some of the primary
conveyance canals serving more than one service area. Storm drainage and flood control works would
constitute similar activities. In the case of water supply, the BWOU would deliver water to designated
"service areas" (SA), thus, having to measure inflow and outflow over the SA boundaries for purposes
of determining the deliveries.
17.          The BWOU would be responsible for operational water resources data collection, water
operations, hydrology, monitoring, maintenance, in-stream permitting and administrative/finance
functions. It would be administratively responsible to the PWRS (more than one PWRS for inter-
provincial basins) for technical guidance, personnel, budgeting, etc. It would execute deliveries in
compliance with the water allocations set-forth by the Basin Water Management Committee, to be
described later, and operate facilities for storm drainage and flood control in a manner to best fulfill these
purposes. Being responsible for maintaining the primary stream channels, the BWOU would have the
responsibility to review and clear all construction and excavation to be authorized within the stream
boundaries. (This may require the clarification of decrees pertaining to current actions by local entities.)
Full control of all activities on the floodplain is essential to flood operations. The control of construction
and mining of aggregate within the boundaries is critical to channel maintenance.  However, the
responsibility for the maintenance of the non-BWOU structures, permitted to be placed within the
boundaries, would remain with the owner of the structures.
18.          The BWOU would be staffed mainly from  the existing PWRS staff.  However,
secondment of experienced professionals from DGWRD and IHE will be needed initially, as PWRS are
short of such experienced staff. Senior individuals experienced in water operations, maintenance,
hydrology and field data collection should be selected. It is anticipated that staff secondments and co-
management support from DGWRD to establish BWOUs in the selected basins would be part of the
ongoing reorganization within DGWRD. For the Jratunseluna basin, initially the existing (central) field



49 -                             ANNEX 2
project organization will provide such support. The project would support technical assistance to establish
the BWRM in the selected basins and to help their operations during the initial three years. The
Technical Assistance (TA) is tentatively estimated (see Table 1 Annex 7) to consist of a total of 440 staff-
months (134 international and 306 local staff-months). The size of this TA is seemingly large, but
outside support would be necessary in view of the innovative nature of this component for the PWRS and
limited experience of DGWRD staff in Basin WRM. The main role of international consultants (long and
short-term specialists) would be to assist in development and installation in individual basins of:
operational, (and allocation support) models; a data storage processing and presentation system; in-stream
water quality management; and a concept of water service fee for cost recovery of BWRM operations.
The consultant would also assist DGWRD/Directorate in coordination and supervision of the BWRM
component implementation in the six basins. In general, the staff of BWOU would carry out the basin
O&M, schematization and data collection assisted by the national consultants (part of a joint venture with
the international firm). The level of assistance will depend on the overall combined approach for the four
new basins, particularly the extent to which common models would be used. A very simple, user-friendly
steady state model would be adapted from an existing model with a commercial GIS program used for
the data management.
19.           The operations within a Service Area (SA) will ultimately be decentralized to local Service
Area Entities (SAE) -- districts, water users' associations (WUAs), M&I supply units (PDAMs), or others
-- in accordance with the newly established policy. Urban SAs already fall under municipal entities.
Some rural SAs likewise are under local entities. In all cases the SAs will ultimately be under a local
(TK II) jurisdiction. The size and physical boundaries of the SAs and the various civil government
jurisdictions will determine their assignment. Indeed, some SAs may be divided among more than one
jurisdiction. The SAs would operate and maintain all SA facilities, including their respective in-stream
diversions, and assess local beneficiaries to pay for the BWOU services. The only exception to local
operation and maintenance of in-stream facilities would be those diversion structures specifically retained
by the BWOU under its control because of size or impact on overall control of basin deliveries. For the
immediate future, the existing PWRS and local units would continue their current responsibility for O&M
of irrigation systems while helping to introduce full decentralization of these functions to District (TK II)
administration and responsibilities, as envisaged under the MHA Decree 39/1992 over a period yet to be
agreed. No outside assistance is contemplated for these activities.
Organization and Responsibilities for Water Allocation and Oversight
20.           While the physical water operations depend on technical factors, the allocation of the
water resources depends on society's objectives and government policies. Thus, the organizational
arrangements and institutions involved are usually quite different. Society's objectives are set forth in
legislation and are implemented in accordance with government policies. The organizational structure
to execute these functions more effectively, as proposed under this project component, is rather straight
forward and builds on the existing systems. To the extent possible, the regulatory aspects must be
separated from the operational aspects in setting up the organizational structure.
21.           The present Provincial Irrigation Committee (would be modified to become the Provincial
Water Management Committee (PWMC)). An instruction to the Governors of the Provinces under the
project to establish PWMCs was issued by MPW in December 1993. Comprised of members appointed
by the Governor, the PWMC would set forth detailed policies and guidelines for allocating the provincial



- 50 -                          ANNEX 2
water resources for all purposes. It would meet as required to make annual modifications as appropriate
to meet current conditions. The policies and guidelines would be in accordance with national legislation
and GOI policies. The PWMC would report to the Governor and submit to the Governor's office an
annual report on its activities.
22.          Within each major basin or group of small basins contained within one province, a Basin
Water Management Committee (BWMC), would be established by the Governor. Comprised of members
appointed by the Governor, the BWMC would apply the provincial policies and guidelines promulgated
by the PWMC in allocating the basin's waters. It would prepare the annual/seasonal/emergency water
allocation plan (WAP) that the BMOU is to meet through the day-to-day basin water operations. The
BWMC would use the WAP as the basis for coordinating water allocations and for monitoring the BWOU
performance. The BWMC would adjudicate any allocation disputes or complaints by SAs regarding the
WAP. It would set forth remedial/enforcement guidelines concerning violations of the WAP for the
BWOU, and other entities as appropriate, to apply. It would also monitor the BWOU storm drainage
and flood operations. The BWOU would submit periodic operating reports to the BWMC documenting
the actual operations, citing any deviations for whatever reason from the WAP. These Committees would
administratively report to the PWMC and submit an annual report on its activities. BWMC, based on
representation of the users including private sector interests, will act as an advisory and oversight body
to adjudicate and coordinate cross-sectoral operational issues. It would also provide opportunity to voice
local concerns in basin water affairs and the first forum to resolve water conflicts. It would meet
periodically (at least quarterly) and its Secretariat would be provided by BWOU. Basic information and
analysis of alternative allocations would be provided to the BWMC by the BWOU. No outside assistance
is proposed for these activities.
23.          While PWMCs, as representatives of the Governor, would have the responsibility to set
allocation policy, they would need drafts of various materials to fulfill this responsibility. Therefore, the
(proposed) Directorate of Regulations and Logistics (DORL), called BINTWR, under DGWRD would,
as one of its first task, develop policies, procedures and guidelines for water allocations to be made by
PWMC and BWMC. DORL should take the lead, with close support from PWRS/BWOU, in formulating
the initial drought operating plans for basins with large concentrations of population or economic
activities. The BWMC, with the assistance of the associated BWOU, would finalize the drought plan and
the BWOU would thereafter have the responsibility to keep it current. The project would provide outside
assistance (about 12 staff-months - 6 staff-month each on preparation of water licensing system and
drought management plan). This will be included in the TA described in para. 18 above.
Accounting System for Water Allocations
24.          Currently, there is no satisfactory means for the physical accounting of the water when
allocating to users and for monitoring the real-time deliveries in accordance with the annual allocation
plan. Such a system is also crucial for recording longer term commitments for major water dependent
investments and in-stream objectives, as well as for financial purposes such as setting up of water service
fees and fixing of subsidies to BWOUs. It will provide the level of detail needed when formulating or
re-evaluating allocation policies and plans. In accordance with the policy of fully integrated water
resources management and to conjunctively manage surface and groundwater, the system should cover
both surface and groundwater. As stated, the surface and groundwater rights must be defined in terms
suitable for both long-term allocation in support of major investment and for annual allocations and real-



-51 -                            ANNEX 2
time operations. Thus, it must be in terms of flow or volume, periods of the year and priority among
all uses in times of shortage. It is particularly important to express it in terms readily understood by the
individual users and local entities. The basic system for defining long-term allocation and the procedures
and documentation involved would also be developed by the DORL/DGWRD at Center.
25.           The Governor now has the responsibility to license (allocate with a defined right)
groundwater use within the province, and hence, within each basin.  In order to institute the
comprehensive surface and groundwater rights system, however, a formal Water Licensing Section (WLS)
should be established at the provincial level to record and monitor provincial water allocation annual and
long term. It would be administratively under PWRS for technical and budget support, but would report
to the PWMC. The WLS would be a small unit of perhaps three engineers and a number of technicians
for record maintenance. DORL/DGWRD would assist with establishing the procedures in each province.
The comprehensive water licensing system would eventually require changes in the existing legal
framework for groundwater licensing.
26.           As surface water and groundwater within a basin are part of the same hydrological cycle,
integration of groundwater and surface water in WRDM has also become necessary. While the data on
surface water resources are obtained from established MPW agencies, including PWRS and RIWRD
(Research Institute for Water Resources Development), the technical support for evaluating the extent and
occurrence of groundwater is now obtained by Directorate General of Environmental Geology (DEG) in
Ministry of Mining and Geology (MOME). It is necessary that the groundwater monitoring and
evaluation responsibility and capability be transferred from MME/DEG to MPW/DGWRD for integrated
WRDM. The monitoring activities of groundwater should be assigned to PWRS while the evaluation
activities be retained by DGWRD/DOLR. Initial discussions between MME and MPW/DGWRD, for
the above purposes, should start in the first year of the project.
Cost Allocation and Funding of Basin Water Resources Management Activities
27.           Prompt, full funding of all activities involving the integrated management of the basin
water resources is essential for meeting the nation's objectives and sustaining the facilities.  The
responsibilities to prepare the budgets of each unit are set, however, funding sources should be
confirmed. Several activities will be funded out of the government's general budget, given their broad
benefits to society. But other service costs will, to varying extent, be passed on to the beneficiaries of
the service. The proposed Water Service Fees (WSF) would be one such. An important action that
would simplify accurate budgeting is instituting a system of cost accounting and cost allocation of all
BWOU activities. Further, this will identify the costs of providing each type of service --- bulk water
supply, flood control, drainage, in-stream water quality, licensing of water, use of flood plains, etc. This
information is basic to determining the amount that the government may wish to recover from
beneficiaries of the various services.
28.          The cost accounting system should be broken down in sufficient detail to identify the
service function causing the cost and the geographical zone within the basin system where that cost is
incurred. For example, the costs of maintaining the water licensing system, determining the water
allocations and carrying out the water operations should be assigned to the water supply function. Levee



-52 -                             ANNEX 2
and river channel maintenance, flood warning and flood fighting can similarly be identified as resulting
from the flood protection function. Some activities support more than one service. Channel maintenance
costs are mostly incurred from flood flows, however, some portion may properly be allocated to the
water supply and water quality functions.
29.           Within the water service function, the total amount allocated to the water service then
would be distributed among the various classes of users and the individual basin geographical service
areas (SAs). These amounts are usually modified to serve as the basis for determining the service cost
assigned to the beneficiaries in order to reflect; (i) the total volume delivered and (ii) the reliability or
priority of the service. For example, the charge to irrigation may be set at a base rate with a multiplier
applied to that rate of 2 to 4 for supply made to urban and industrial users. This reflects the higher
priority/reliability given urban and industrial users during times of shortages. Once cost allocation is in
place, the costs for each service becomes evident. Then the extent of beneficiary contribution and the
extent of government funding can be determined. Prompt full funding of O&M activities for integrated
management of a basin's water resources would be essential to meet BWRM's objectives. Service costs,
to varying extent keeping in view the socio-economic objectives, must be passed on to the beneficiaries
through a WSF for bulk delivery of raw water to the user agencies and/or utilities.
30.           It is possible that the present ISF applied to farmers to cover the cost of water supply to
irrigators will be replaced by a Water Service Fee (WSF) some time in the future when applied to all
beneficiaries.  All rural water supply customers would thereafter be charged, including villages,
aquaculturalists and irrigators.  As under ISF, the WSF would eventually cover all O&M  and
administrative costs to serve the water. Accordingly, one component of the WSF would be cost of the
bulk water supply delivered to the SA by the basin BWOU. This component would be charged as a Bulk
Service Fee (BSF), to the individual SAs. In turn the SA entities would charge their customers a WSF
that would comprise the cost of the bulk supply, the BSF, and the O&M costs directly incurred by the
SA. The WSF would differ among beneficiaries -- villages, aquaculturalists and irrigators, as well as
urban and industrial -- as determnined by the multipliers reflecting differences in the services provided.
It should be noted that currently the Brantas and Jatiluhur Authorities charge fees (at very low rates) for
the supply of raw water for M&I uses and for hydro-power generation.
E. Other Matters for Consideration
31.           Institutional Arrangements for Inter-provincial Basins. Currently, the inter-provincial
pilot (Cisanggarung) basin BWOU reports to DGWRD, while BWOU of the Opak Basin located within
one province, reports to PWRS. The future detailed arrangements for inter-provincial (Class A) basins
are not known; however, it is understood that they would minimize provincial responsibilities. This is
for the purpose of avoiding inter-provincial conflicts. It would seem that a refinement of the means by
which MPW/DGWRD would give direction to inter-provincial basins could be made along the lines
outlined above.
32.           In order to better integrate water resources management, all water related activities in the
province would be focused under the Governor. At the same time MPW has a role to resolve any
conflicts among adjacent provinces in a basin shared by two provinces. These two objectives, that seem
conflicting, would be met by having the representatives of the PWMCs of the provinces, involved in an
inter-provincial basin serve under the chairmanship of a representative from MPW or alternatively use



-53-                              ANNEX 2
the existing MPW coordination commnittee (SPK/TPA) chaired by Director, DPP/DGWRD. This entity
would provide the allocation policy and guidelines for the basin. The BWMC for the inter-provincial
basin, which is more directly involved in the basin allocation, similarly could be composed of appropriate
membership from each province appointed by the respective governors. DGWRD/MPW could retain
whatever final decision power it judges necessary to meet its responsibilities. The BWOU in such basins
could be a deconcentrated DGWRD organization, staffed and supported from the PWRSs comprising the
basin.
33.           Membership of PWMCs and BWMCs. Current plans show that all members of the
PWMCs and BWMCs would come from government agencies. Given the policy to decentralize and to
seek greater participation of the local residents and beneficiaries in the water management, it would be
appropriate to modify the proposed composition of these two entities by including individuals representing
the involved sectors, and professional societies, people from the general public and universities. It has
proven wise to allay public fears, indeed, secure public support for otherwise unpopular decisions. These
members would also introduce different perspectives into the deliberations. Accordingly, it may be
desirable to have 25 % of the membership of the PWMCs and BWMCs selected from outside government
which would still assure full government guidance of the boards. This needs to be considered while
formulating the Provincial decrees setting up PWMC and BWMC.
34.           Establishing Water Oualitv Objectives. The BWMC and the BWOU need to manage the
basin waters to meet both quantity and quality objectives. Accordingly, the BWMC will allocate water
as it judges appropriate to meet the quality standards set by the GOI environmental agencies. The BWOU
would monitor the stream water quality and operate its facilities to meet objectives to the extent possible
using the water that the BWMC allocated for these purposes. Since, the BWOU would have no
jurisdiction or skills to set water quality standards, the responsible environmental agencies should prepare
specific objectives, expressed as measurable quality criteria, at key locations in the basin streams for use
by the BWMC in its deliberations on allocations. These agencies would also be represented on the
PWMCs. These would also be used by the BWOU to locate the points and levels of water quality to be
monitored.
35.          Cost Recovery for Basin Non-water Supply Services. As noted, in most situations the
beneficiaries of non-water supply services are not now assessed the associated costs. Major industries
receive free storm drainage and flood protection services while the adjacent rice grower pays for his water
service. Because of this inequity, the seeming impossibility of adequate government funding of O&M
now and the huge investment and O&M costs that soon will be incurred in the urban area, most countries
have found it necessary to charge for all services in the water sector. In many countries these services
have long been recovered, usually by virtue of the fact that the beneficiaries built and maintained their
immediate drainage and flood protection facilities. This is, of course, also the history of much of the
irrigation services, even in parts of Indonesia.
36.          The most common procedure for recovering for storm drainage and flood control is
through the application of betterment taxes adjusted to three or four different geographical zones of
benefits within the protected area. Importantly, all fees, charges and betterment taxes for water services
would pass directly to the responsible O&M unit -- established in the form of utilities (the utility concept
has been described in other documents). This will better assure that the charges are: (i) based on the cost
of service, (ii) the recovery relates to the service provided, (iii) the responsible local entity has an
incentive to be efficient, and (iv) the beneficiaries can deal directly with those whom they pay.

JAVA IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT AND WATER RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT PROJECT
IMPLEMENTAON OF TURNOVER PROGRAM AND REHABILITATION
A. TURNOVER PROGRAM
Key Activities. This would follow the system successfully implemented under ISSP II,
with some modifications based on the results of monitoring and evaluation study of systems already
turned over, completed in June 1993. Tumover activities can be distinguished in seven successive
phae:
(a)    System Inventory and Profiling. (i) collecting basic data from the PWRS Buku
Pintar; (ii) categorizing systems for future treatment in the turnover process; and
(iii) selecting schemes for profiling; (iv) collecting in-depth information on social
and technical aspects relevant to eventual turnover; (v) compiling a list of system
improvements proposed by farmers; and (vi) resolving the nature and extent of
farmer equity involvement.
(b)    WUA Establishment/Development. An ongoing activity starting at the profiling
phase and continuing several months after turnover; formalizing the WUA and
getting it registered and legalized by decree of Bupati.
(c)    Design. (i) the preparation of a cost-effective design, focussing on major
structures such as headworks, cross-drainage structures and stabilization of feeder
canals along steep hill slopes, (ii) the preparation of sketches of canal
improvements and structure rehabilitation.
(d)    Construction. (i) bringing the system in good working condition before turnover
to farmer groups; and (ii) providing an activity for farmers' participation and an
impetus for WUA development.
(e)    WUA Training. This follows the completion of system improvements, and is
aimed at delivery of training for O&M and basic financial management.
(f)    Preparation for Turnover. Preparation of administrative documents necessary
for turnover. WUA registration through a decree by the Bupati should be
completed at this time.
(g)    Actual Turnover. Formal transfer to WUA of system management, through
Bupati.
2.           Farmer Particpation in Turnover is a key element for the success of the turnover



-58-                              A
program. Prior to selecting a scheme for turnover assistance, the farmers concerned would be made
aware of what is involved. They will be told what the government investment ceiling will be and what
will be expected from them. Under turnover, the special maintenance (deferred maintenance and modest
upgrading) assistance would be used as a symbol to agree on: what the relationship between WUAs and
PWRS will be after turnover, i.e., where there is a joint investment, where both sides must economize,
and where the agency assist farmers only in problems which are beyond their capabilities of resolving
by themselves. In order to identify the real needs for system improvement, the tumover officer and
representatives of the farming community/WUA will conduct a system walk-through. This joint on-site
inspection tour, provides a sound basis for consensus between PWRS and system users on the work plan
for system improvement and its O&M in the future.
3.            The processes (a), (c), (f) and (g) have usually taken a long time. However, as a result
of the experience gained under ISSP 11, and as an appropriate legal framework for turnover is already
instituted and as Java farmers traditionally work together in many forms of agricultural activities, it would
be relatively easy to simplify and expedite the above processes. A greater emphasis would be given to
farmers' participation and WUA training. It would also be appropriate to involve, earlier in the process,
the Provincial Agricultural Services (PAS) staff in improving on-farm water management and diversifying
agricultural production.
4.            Scope. The project would finance the costs of inventory and profiling of systems, WUA
formation and development, WUA training, and design and construction of system improvement, as well
as consultancy services for designs and implementation. The program will cover all Java provinces
(Table 1). Ideally, system turnover within a contiguous area should proceed irrespective of system size.
This approach will allow for a most efficient turnover process: review of the possibility for
interconnection; Local Government awareness; simple administrative arrangements and easy supervision.
All systems less than 500 ha which were rehabilitated or constructed under the Loan 2649-IND (Central
and West Java Irrigation Project), and not yet turned over, would be transferred to WUAs during the first
two project years. The problematic schemes which are located within regularly flooded plains such as
in Jratunseluna basin in Central Java, lower Bengawan-Solo and Brantas basin, in East Java would receive
low priority under the proposed project or left for the future turnover.
Implementation of Turnover
5.            Design. Design criteria and guidelines for turnover construction (SM) works prepared
under ISSP II would be generally used for the project. However, simplification in documentation and
designs will be made to expedite administrative/contractual procedures, and help ensure that structures
are not oversized and/or too difficult for farmers to operate and maintain after turnover. While some
small systems may require improved diversions, and a few others may require new structures, the
majority of systems would require neither. All small schemes recently completed and/or rehabilitated
under the special projects would require minimal system improvement. During designs, the following
essential criteria would be applicable:
(a)    designs to be cost-effective and within the capability of farmers/WUAs to operate
and maintain. Basic guidelines for O&M to be furnished as part of the designs;
(b)    SM construction works to be related to structures (e.g., headworks, intakes and
cross-drainage works) and lead canals, while the canal earthworks would be



-59-                             ANNEX 4
carried out by WUAs as farner's equity contribution;
(c)    construction of new weirs and unnecessary linings will be discouraged. Instead,
use of pumps and/or shifting of intakes upstream would be encouraged as such
could be appropriate and cost-effective in many instances; and
(d)   typically, SM works would be necessary to assure functional reliability, rectify
instances of dangerous deterioration, and possibly modify some structures to
improve or simplify water delivery. Works to cxpand service area or increase
consumptive use to the detriment of downstream users will not be included in the
proposed project.
6.    The SM design works will be carried out on subcontract to local consulting firms under the
supervision of PWRS. The designs for first year's (1995/96) construction covering a total of 38,000 ha
(22,400 ha already programmed plus an additional 15,600 ha) would be available from ISSP II. Designs
would be completed for an additional 398,450 ha of which 80,000 ha would be for works to be
constructed and turned over after the project completion. For Central and East Java Provinces an
additional area of 20% for inventory/profiling is budgeted. The consultancy for irrigation development
will include three national experts to assist PWRS on planning and monitoring of the turnover
implementation.
7.           Construction. The question whether construction is to be done by hired contractors, by
force account (swakelola) or by WUAs will largely depend on local conditions: availability of qualified
and reliable contractors, capacity (total workload and staff strength of the government agency concerned)
and the volume and nature of work to be covered in the turnover program, etc. The PWRS will,
however, have to perform the all-important tasks of on-site supervision, quick transfer of information on
field problems to the turnover coordinator at the cabang level, quick follow-up action from the cabang,
and be flexible within budget limitations. PWRS would encourage contractors to use farmer labor for
unskilled tasks where and whenever possible. Farmers/WUAs should also receive a fair (which may be
10 percent of total depending on the amount of earth works) share of SM work contracts, which they can
now undertake under the recent MHA Regulation 39/92. This will not only allow increased income
opportunity for the farmers but also would enhance farmers participation in turnover. In general, the
impact of turnover works has been reported as good or better for works recently undertaken through
taskforce or WUAs compared with those undertaken on contracts.
8.           Implementation Schedule. The construction implementation activities under the project
would start in the second project year (1995/96). The preparatory works for the 1995/96 construction
program would be completed under ISSP II. Under JIWMP Inventory & Profiling will be carried out
in the fiscal year before the design (year). The program will start with Inventory & Profiling in 1994/95
leading to design in 1995/1996 and construction in 1996/97. The program would progressively build to
the final project year (1999/2000), attaining peaks of design work in 1998/99 and construction in
1999/2000, each covering a total area of 102,452 ha. The summary of annual design, construction, and
turnover activities is given below in Table 1.

PWRS Involvement After Turnover
9.     It needs to be stressed that, after system turnover to farmers has taken effect, the WUAs would
not be totally abandoned and left on their own. It will be made quite clear to them that whenever they
need guidance, advice or technical assistance, they can seek it from PWRS (juru, ranting, cabang). Even
though routine O&M will be the farmers' responsibility, there may be a need for emergency repairs,
which are beyond their means.  This may be, in the case of serious damages or wash-out of
headworks/weirs, after flash flood or other natural disasters. It is understood that the responsibility of
Public Works (as the principal water resources authority) for system headworks (weirs, dams, big
diversion structures, etc.) will not entirely cease at turnover. Importantly, continued follow-up and
routine irrigation extension services and counseling of WUAs on the turned over small systems will,
explicitly, find expression in the regional budget (APBD). The Public Works involvement after turnover
is regulated by the Ministerial Regulation (Permen) No. 42/PRT/1989. While under current laws and
established turnover procedures, only the O&M responsibility is transferred to WUAs, the assets still
remain in the hands of the government. The recent MHA Regulation No. 12/1992 enhances the legl
status of WUAs to open bank accounts, to undertake contractual work, and levy charges.  Full
privatization, involving transfer of assets to WUAs, is still a distant objective. However, the implications
and modalities of asset transfer to WUA would be studied during the project period.
B. IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT
General
10.    The irrigation development component of the project consists of two parts:  (a) irrigation
rehabilitation; and (b) small new irrigation development. At negotiations it was agreed to include a third
part under the project's Irrigation Development component: support for the implementation of renmdil
works on 11,300 ha of the Dumpil Irrigation System in Central Java at an estimated cost of US$9.0
million (Table 2). The first part would include the rehabilitation of those irrigation systems that are
larger than 500 ha, and have not been rehabilitated or upgraded before. Some of these systems would
also be expanded under the project. The systems included in the project for rehabilitation and expanion
cover 217,412 ha, of which 68,843 ha (32 percent) are in West Java, 39,260 ha (18 percent) in CentMl
Java, and 109,309 ha (50 percent) in East Java. The new development would consist of the constructin
of one new schemes, in West Java, to irrigate 600 ha. Thus the, irrigation development under the project



- 61-                                   ANNEX 4
would total about 230,000 ha, including the Dumpil remedial works on 11,300 ha.

Irrigation Rehabilitation
11.    General. During the previous Bank-financed provincial projects in Java (EJIP, and CWJIP),
an inventory of all provincial irrigation projects had been prepared and computerized, and this is
continuously updated. Using this as the data base, a long list of all unrehabilitated systems in each
Java province was prepared during the project preparation period. These lists were then critically
reviewed, and a short list of 245 systems covering an area of 311,922 ha was proposed by GOI for
inclusion in the project, which was subsequently reduced again.
12.    Selection Criteria. The pre-appraisal mission used the following criteria to select systems for
inclusion in the project:
(a)     Unaffected By Annual Floods. Systems serving areas that are either adversely
affected by annual floods, or have chronic unresolved drainage problems have been
excluded.
(b)     Water Availability. Although relevant, and reliable hydrological data of smaller
rivers for each individual system is not always available, sufficient hydrological
analysis has been carried out on the basis of a river basin to confirm that sufficient
water would be available for each individual system for the existing cropping
intensity. Where water availability is substantially more than that required by the
existing command area, expansion of irrigated area has been considered if rainfed
sawah areas are adjacently located.
(c)     Possibility of Interconnection. Those contiguous systems, usually on the same river
but sometimes smaller than 500 ha, where interconnection is clearly beneficial to the



- 62 -                            ANNEX 4
systems, and would result in reduction of operational waste of water, and sometimes
expansion of irrigation area have been included to take advantage of the flow
augmentation possibility.
(d)    Cost. Those systems, whose rehabilitation is estimated to cost more than
Rp 1,000,000 (US$475) per ha, have been generally excluded, unless an area
expansion is involved, and the higher cost is fully justified in relation to the expected
benefits.
(e)    Economic Rate of Return. A preliminary economic analysis on the basis of
representative models indicates that the expected ERR would be greater than
12 percent.
(f)    Enviromnental Impact. Systems, where rehabilitation would have an adverse effect
on environmental considerations, have been excluded.
13.    Selected systems. A list of 220 systems selected for inclusion in the project is provided in
Annex 9 and is summarized by provinces in Table 3 below. Total area of these systems, as presently
recorded in the provincial inventories but corrected to the design area wherever a design has already
been carried out, is 201,869 ha. It is expected that after the project, the irrigated area would increase
by 15,543 ha to 217,412 ha, due to expansion of area in the command of 42 systems. This expansion
would become possible either because of surplus water supplies available in the rivers feeding these
systems, and more efficient utilization of supplies in the systems to be interconnected under the
project. Of the above selected systems, in West Java there are 18 Technical (17,533 ha), 25
Semitechnical (31,743 ha), and 24 Simple (19,567 ha) systems, which individually range in size from
500 ha to 6,000 ha. In Central Java, the Technical systems number 15 (13,686 ha), Semitechnical 10
(8,815 ha), and Simple 21 (16,759 ha); these range from 501 ha to 3,401 ha. In East Java, the
Technical systems predominate and number 87 (85,712 ha), the Semitechnical and Simple are
respectively 18 (20,584 ha) and 2 (3,013 ha). The East Java systems range fromr 501 ha to 6,334 ha.

14.    Final Selection. Since project implementation would proceed on the basis of Annual Work



- 63 -                            ANNEX 4
Programs, which would be reviewed every year by the Bank, final go ahead for construction of
individual systems would be given at that stage. It is possible that some of the selected systems might
not be eventually chosen for implementation, when additional data (both physical and cost) becomes
available, after final designs. It is expected that at that time other systems, meeting the specified
criteria, may take their place,and the total area to be rehabilitated under the project may remain at
about 217,000 ha. Assurances would be obtained that the criteria for final selection of a scheme for
construction, after completing design, would be:
(a)    confirmation of sustained water availability in the basin context. This may require
clearances from PJT on some schemes in the Brantas Basin;
(b)    for schemes costing more than Rp 1,000,000/ha (US$475), verification of economic
viability, i.e., an ERR of at least 12 percent excluding sunk costs; and
(c)    acceptance of the farmers on the scheme to re-activate WUAs and their willingness to
pay ISF.
(d)    assurance by the Provincial Government that systems to be rehabilitated would not
undergo conversion to alternative uses within a reasonable long (more than 10 years)
time frame.
Surveys, Investigations, and Design
15.   Available Designs. Under EJIP (Loan 2119-IND), and CWJIP (Loan 2649-IND), survey and
design work was carried out on several systems, both larger than 500 ha and smaller, which were not
included for rehabilitation under those projects but were intended to be taken up for implementation in
the future. Excluding those systems that have either been constructed under GOI funds or through
other projects (e.g. ISSP II), areas of systems (larger than 500 ha) for which design is available for
use by this project are as follows: West Java, 33,684 ha; Central Java, 18,612 ha; and East Java,
28,299 ha. During project preparation, it was considered advisable to review the available designs
primarily to: (a) update them in view of field changes that might have occurred during the elapsed
time; (b) ensure good standards of design and their uniform quality; and (c) explore whether
rehabilitation costs can be reduced. Following the sample reviews that were carried out during
project preparation, it was concluded that several adjustments, minor in some systems but major in
others due to changes in field conditions were necessary. Table 4 below gives total areas for which
designs are available, areas whose designs have already been reviewed and the type of adjustment
(major or minor) needed, and also lists those areas whose designs are yet to be reviewed. Areas with
minor adjustments are ready for tendering, but those needing major adjustments require substantial
changes, sometimes after field checks or resurveys.
16.   Design Adjustment And Review. Minor and major design adjustments to the reviewed
designs (40,674 ha) would be completed by December 1993, before the Project's start. This work
would be continued by the consultant, who assisted GOI in project preparation, through an addendum
to his contract and financed under Loan 3392-IND. The remaining reviews (39,921 ha) and the
adjustments required, following these reviews, would be carried out under the project (year 1).
17.    Other Available Designs. In addition to the above, final designs, to be carried out under
ISSP II, (1994/95) will be available for 16,288 ha on several systems in East Java; these do not

require any review or adjustments. In West Java, designs are also available for 6,261 ha, for
rehabilitation of six systems which could not be completed under CWJIP (Loan 2649-IND) prior to its
closure.
18.    Future Design Work And Phasing. After adjustment of the designs available under EJIP,
and CWJIP (80,595 ha), the rehabilitation component of the project would require new survey,
investigation, and design (SID) for only 115,095 ha. By province, this area is as follows: West Java
29,725 ha; Central Java 20,648 ha; and East Java 64,722 ha. This work would be carried out during
project implementation. It is planned to complete this work for Central Java in 2'h years (part
1994/95, 1995/96, and 1996/97), and for West and East Java in 3'h years (1994/95 to 1997/98).
19.    Design Criteria. During design reviews, and new design work, the following criteria would
be generally followed. Systems, which do not conform to these criteria, would be excluded from the
project scope during review of the annual work programs.
(a)    Water Availability. Availability of water supplies, assessed by others during detailed
design stage, could be critically reviewed to ensure that water requirements of the
area to be irrigated are available in at least 4 out of 5 years. In case of significant
shortages, a reduction of area, and for excess supplies, extension or expansion of the
system would be considered.
(b)    Design Standards. Irrigation design standards, issued by DGWRD would be used.
(c)    Diversion Weirs. For existing permanent weirs, special attention would be paid to
the need for silt-exclusion at the headworks. If the need is established, then this
facility would be provided at the most economical cost.
(d)    Interconnected Systems. For those individual systems, where permanent weirs do
not exist, and the systems are to be interconnected, consideration would be given to
construct a permanent weir at the head of the new system for increasing operational



-65-                             ANNEX
efficiency of the combined system.
(e)    Canal Lining. Lining of main, and secondary canals would be provided only in those
sections, and to those canal banks, where it is absolutely necessary for the safety of
one or both banks for the following or similar reasons: (i) proximity to populated
areas; (ii) when the canal is aligned on a steep hillside; (iii) when the canal sits on a
high embankment; (iv) when the canal passes through unstable or friable soils; and
(v) for protection of canal banks just upstream or downstream of an important
structure, particularly a drop structure or a regulator.
(f)    Preparatory Works for EOM would include: system planning to establish irrigation
system requirements and performance; plan of O&M, including system specific
manual for O&M, a system data books, an album of maps and drawings (as built on
completion of construction).
New Irrigation Development
20.   General. Since the project is intended to improve the existing irrigation systems, only limited
new irrigation development was considered for inclusion in the project. Development of three new
systems (total area 8,600 ha) was proposed by GOI, but one system (2,000 ha) in Central Java was
not accepted for inclusion as the proposed area is suffering chronic flooding, and drainage problems.
The Padawaras scheme (6,000 ha) was found not to be economically feasible and therefore not
Included. Thus new development to be included in the project would be the Ciberena system of 600
ha.
Cibaro System
21.   Description and Status. The proposed Cibareno scheme is located close to the southern
coast of West Java in kabupatens Lebak and Sukabumi. An area of about 2,300 ha is available for
this scheme, which is presently under simple irrigation or rainfed sawah (700 ha), or dry crop
cultivation (1,600 ha). No discharge data is available for the Cibareno river, which is the source of
water for this scheme. A preliminary hydrological simulation indicates water availability for about
600 ha, but it is possible that additional data and detailed hydrological analysis may indicate a bigger
potential. GOI, through the West Java PWRS, would arrange additional hydrological information and
analysis before the detailed design of this scheme can be started. It is proposed tc delay the design of
this system to 1996/97, and its construction to 1997/98.
Implmentation
22.   Arrangements For Design Implementation. Table 5 indicates the extent of design works to
be carried out during the project implementation. Detailed design under the project, whether new or
review of designs already carried out and their adjustment, would be carried out in three different
manners:
(a)    Design Groups. The departmental Design Groups, which were established in the

/b Includes 16,288 ha for which designs to be completed under ISSP II, 1994/1995
three provinces under EJIP, and CWJIP would be reactivated, and about 20 percent to
25 percent work (relatively easier work of design review and adjustment, and new
design of smaller systems) would be arranged through them. This would have the
advantage of providing hands-on training to PWRS staff, which has already proved
useful in EJIP and CWJIP. The capacity of the Groups in each province is limited,
and varies from 2,000 ha to 3,000 ha per year depending on the type of work, and the
staff available. Technical guidance to the Groups would be provided by Planning and
Design Sections of PWRSs and the Project Consultant to be employed under the
project for technical assistance.
(b)    Local Consultants. New design for about 25 percent of total area (consisting
generally of larger schemes), would be contracted out to competent local consulting
firms, who would be selected from a short list of firms, after inviting proposals.
Work done by these firms would be overseen, and guided if necessary, by the project
Consultant to ensure quality under the assistance concept. Most field survey and site
investigation work would also be contracted to specialist national firms, experienced
in this type of work.
(c)    Project Consultant. The remaining design reviews, and new design work, about



-67 -                              _
55 percent to 66 percent of total, would be entrusted to the Project Consultant under
the task concept.
23.   Phasing of Design Work. It is planned to complete the survey and design work in Central
Java during the first 2'h years (1994/95-1996/97), and in West and East Java in 3'h years (1994/95-
1997/98). The detailed implementation schedule for design work, indicating the work to be entrusted
to each of the three provinces, is given in project files. Total work to be done each year is
summarized in Table 6 below.

24.   Distribution Of Design Work Between Agencies. In accordance with the arrangements
described above, the approximate distribution of design work between the three agencies would be as
in Table 7 below. This is only indicative for purposes of planning the input needed from these
agencies, and would be refined each year, as part of the Annual Work Program.

Construction. The construction activities under the project would be of three types: (a)
rehabilitation of existing systems; (b) construction of one new system; and (c) construction of
facilities, mainly residential for juru and field office accommnodation for O&M. In category (a), there
are 178 systems (40 in West Java, 39 in Central Java, and 99 in East Java), which would be
rehabilitated without any increase in the irrigated area. It also includes 42 systems, where the
rehabilitation and interconnection works would result in an expansion of irrigation on 15,543 ha.
These systems are distributed as follows: West Java, 27 systems with expansion of 11,465 ha;
Central Java 7 systems with 2,716 ha; and East Java 8 systems with 1,362 ha. The works involved
in each type of activity are described below.
25.   Description of Works. The typical works to be carried out, under the irrigation development
component of the project would be mostly minor in nature except where new weirs or desiltation
works as major cross drainage works are involved. These would consist of the following types of



-69 -                             ANNEX
work:
(a)    Diversion Weirs. Structural repairs (stone masonry or concrete) to the existing
diversion weirs, mostly at their crest, floors and wing walls; repairs to the canal
intakes, or sluice gates, and in case of heavy damage to these gates, their
replacement; and placing riprap for floor protection. In the two new systems, and in
some of the systems to be rehabilitated and interconnected, construction of new weirs
would be included. In some systems, addition of a desiltation facility (silt excluder or
desilting basin) would be required.
(b)    Excavation of Canals. Earthwork involved in restoring the canal cross-sections to
original design, or in widening or extending the canals; and excavation of new canals
for interconnected systems, new systems or for expansion areas.
(c)    Lining of Canals. Canal lining either by precast concrete slabs or by dressed stone
masonry.
(d)    Structures. Structural repairs (mostly stone masonry, some concrete work) to the
existing structures; construction of new structures, particularly on upgrading of
semitechnical and simple systems, and new systems; and repairs to or replacement of
existing gates and their hoists; and new gates and hoists for the new regulating
structures.
(e)    Field Reservoirs. Compacted earthwork in repairing the embankments of existing
field reservoirs, mainly in East and Central Java, and repairs to or reconstruction of
small masonry spillways, involving concrete or stonework.
(f)    Building Facilities. This includes the construction of new houses for Jurus and
Pengamats, repairs to some existing houses, and construction of some additional office
accommodation. This type of works would be very simple and limited to the
incremental needs to house field staff for sustained EOM in the irrigation development
areas, and to provide additional space (about Rp 400 million or US$200,000) in the
new Central Java PWRS building for the Design Unit, as well as for West and East
Java Provinces.
26.    Construction Arrangements. All construction would be arranged through contracts, which
would be awarded after competitive bidding. Generally, there would be one contract for one system,
but where two systems are close a combined contract for the two would be preferred. Contracts
valued at Rp 6.3 billion (US$3.0 million) or above, would be procured following ICB procedures
(there are expected to be none), whereas contracts below this limit would follow LCB procedures.
27.   Phasing of Construction. It is planned to initiate construction activities in April 1995, about
6 months after loan effectiveness. By that time, final designs, and tender documents would be
available for at least 60 systems covering 56,962 ha (Table 8), which would enable PWRSs to call for
bids for the rehabilitation of these systems. Since construction activity in Central Java would be
relatively smaller than the other two provinces, it is planned to complete it in 3 years (1995/96 to
1997/98). In West, construction would be completed in 4 years (1995/96 to 1998/99), while in East
Java construction will last for 5 years (1995/96 to 1999/00) Detail of construction activity in each

JAVA IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT AND WATER
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
SMALL COMPONENTs DESCRIPTON
1.              JIWMP contains four smaller components directed to river maintenance, public
awareness, vetiver or other hedge row technology and flood forecasting and warning. River
maintenance and hedge row technology are costed under River Basin Water Resources Management--
Real Time Operations. The public awareness program is costed under Planning. Flood forecasting
and management is supported by real time operations and hydrology. However, they deserve separate
description which follows.
2.               Pilot River Infrastructure and Facilities Program. A pilot river infrastructure
maintenance activity would be introduced in Jratunseluna and Cisanggarung river basins. The pilot
program follows recommendations of the July, 1993 CIDA report "An Integrated Program for the
Development of O&M for Rivers in Indonesia", available in project files. The main elements of the
three year pilot program, which will parallel tasks under the financial sub-component of the real-time
BWRM component, are:
(a)   Physical maintenance activities of the river infrastructure;
(b)   Administrative and managerial operational activities; and
(c)   Technical assistance to establish maintenance
procedures for structures as a general model.
Activities would concentrate on river morphology, river and bank stability, corridor management, sand
excavation, river system dredging, river mouth stability, and maintenance of river structures such as
weirs and dams. This sub-component would emphasize establishing procedures and managerial
capabilities for these activities. Costs for item (a), estimated at Rp. 10.64 billion, are already provided
under the incremental maintenance cost (item 4b) of the BWRM component, in view of the importance
and complexity of river structures in these basins. However, there is no generally agreed or
progranunatic set of maintenance procedures.  CIDA has helped identify technical assistance
requirements to develop general river maintenance procedures which could be applied to other systems.
This technical assistance, item (c), is provided for in the project at a tentative cost of Rp. 800 million,
about half of which would be TA. It would require about 6-9 man months of foreign and 36 man
months of local consultancy inputs. Implementing these new procedures and testing them in the two
pilot systems has been allowed for in administrative and managerial costs at a level of Rp.400 million
(b above).



-73-                           6
3.              Public Awareness Program. A Public Awareness Program sub-component is
included in the Basin Water Resources Planning advisory services package (TA Package No. 1; see
Annex 7). This program would target both the general public and government officials on the
objectives and methods of integrated water resources management, water conservation, pollution
prevention, flood plain use, in-stream water quality management, etc. The cost is estimated at about
Rp. 300 million for advice, program formulation, drafting materials and initiating efforts in selected
basins. The main objectives of the program are to inform the public and concerned officials of water
resources problems and issues, arrange opportunities for public discussions on pertinent water resource
topics, describe for the public the purpose and content of government programs and projects, and
provide information on integrated water resources management and the importance of pollution control
to schools.
4.              Vetiver Hedge Row or Other Hedge Grass Technology. Two pilot projects in
each of East, Central and West Java provinces would be financed to introduce vetiver hedge row or
other hedge grass technology for erosion and sediment control for flood plain flood dikes,
embankments, canal cuts, drainage channels, as well as stream bank stabilization. This activity is
costed at Rp 1 billion and would be coordinated with the Ministry of Forestry's Department of Soil
Conservation. A few months of international technical assistance may be required for design and
program checks, not to exceed US$ 50,000 in cost.
5.              Flood Forecasting and Warning System. Basin Water Operations Units would
be responsible for flood management including forecasting and warning. They would rely on the
strengthened hydrological data and telemetry system supported in the hydrological component of this
project. One objective is to sustain and possibly expand the system installed under the Kedung Ombo
Project. Hydro/meteorological stations have been costed at Rp. 1.2 billion under hydrology. Flood
management equipment has been costed at Rp. 690 million for the project.

JAVA IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT AND WATER
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.          Technical assistance provided by various leaders and donors to DGWRD and PWRS has
been extensive, ranging from 11% on older projects to 8% more recently. The TA and consulting
services share of this project is about 10% of project cost. However, as a matter of policy, GOI has
encouraged the use of local consultants for routine design engineering work while containing its own staff
under various departments. Thus, the project includes US$9.6 million for local design engineering
services. If these services are netted out of TA, remaining consultancies drop to 6% of project costs.
In the case of activities which need to be carried out on a continued basis beyond the project
implementation period, the consultancy services need to be phased out. The programs which are in an
initial development phase (e.g., river basin water resources management) and have yet to be routinely
established will continue to require a relatively large content of technical assistance. The implementation
of a large program on irrigation development (covering about 230,000 ha) and turnover of small systems
(356,000 ha) over a six-year period would require a considerable input from outside consultants as all
tasks can not be handled by in-house PWRS staff. There is a considerable scope for improvement in
Government's selection, management and supervision of consultancies. Likewise there is a need to assign
specific DGWRD and PWRS staff to the related tasks i.e., as counterparts to consultants, for preparation
of BWRP, and to undertake a portion of the irrigation designs by Design Group of PWRS under the
guidance of consultants. Supervision of construction for the irrigation and turnover (SM) works and
design and supervision of EOM implementation would be carried out by the PWRS staff. All these
elements have been taken into account in the design and scope of the technical assistance under the
proposed project.
2.          Total consultancy services for the project would be about 535 foreign and 1,768 local
person-months, and is estimated to cost US$29.5 million (without taxes). The survey, investigations and
designs (SIDs) by local consulting firms and PWRS Design Groups cost US$9.6 million and are routine
activities directly associated with the construction of irrigation works. The packaging and costs are
summarized in Table 1. The TORs have been agreed with GOI and are in project files. The consultant
inputs have been considerably scaled down compared with the predecessor projects (CWJIP, ISSPs) and
all foreign consultancy support would be phased out by the fourth year of the project. The nine
consultancy packages are as follows:
(a)   Three packages (P1, P2, P3) for support of integrated water resources management and
preparation of basin water resource plans equal 242 foreign person-months and 443 local
person-months. The TA for preparing Basin Water Resources Plan, will be arranged
through twinning arrangement with a reputed international agency.
(b)   One package (P4) supports Java PWRS irrigation components, including detailed designs
for 60 percent of irrigation development, and supervision and guidance of the remaining



-75-                            ANNEX
detailed design by national consultants and PWRS Design Groups. The consultants would
also assist PWRS in overall planning and programming and annual implementation
reviews, including the Dumpil remedial works. This TA will comprise 135 foreign
person-months and 741 local person-months.
(c)   One package (P5) of advisory services to DGPUOD and Provincial Governments for
implementation guidance/oversight of the ISF program consisting of 36 foreign person-
months and 160 local person-months.
(d)   One package (P6) consisting of 24 foreign person-months and 120 local person-months,
to assist DGWRD/DPP in overall project coordination, annual work programming and
monitoring and evaluation of project impact. A direct appointment of the present ISSP
II/GCA Consultant is proposed.
(e)   One package (P7) for consulting services (approximately 28 foreign and 67 local person
months) is included for the formulation of Phase 11 JIWMP.
(f)   Package P8 would extend the provision of technical and operational support to the Quality
Assurance Office in DGWRD beyond 1995. The package consists of 36 foreign and 108
local person-months over a three year period.
(g)   Package P9 would assist MPW/DGWRD to initiate technical audits of contracting
procedures, construction of works, supply of equipment and the delivery of services. The
package consists of 24 foreign and 108 local person-months over a four year period.
3.          These packages have been regrouped in Table 1 by Policy Advice and Studies (11%),
Implementation Support (65%), and Institutional Capacity Building (24%). All major consultant
proposals would be evaluated and awarded by January 15, 1995, except for the ISF consultants who
would be employed by April, 1995. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
4.          Technical services costing about US$9.6 million are necessary for the SID and would be
contracted or subcontracted to local consulting firms largely based in the provinces.  It is the
Government's policy to contract out simple design works to local consulting industry. The TOR of
Irrigation Consultants (package P4) includes the responsibility to assist in guiding and supervising the
local firms and PWRS Design Group in order to build up a sustained local capacity for planning and SID
of irrigation works in Indonesia.
5.          There is also a small allocation of less than US$200,000 for assisting a pilot river
maintenance program (total component cost is Rp 800 million or US$400,000), and about US$50,000 for
a short-term consultant for vetiver hedge row technology. (See Annex 6 for details).

executed on a force account basis, local design services contracts valued at less than $100,000; and the
cost of training, surveys, operational expenses, etc. The institutional and training expenses ($4.5 million)
would relate to costs of various training delivery and materials, workshops, per diems, and dissemination
programs for ISF, turnover and WUA establishment and strengthening. Disbursement for other
expenditures would be on the basis of full documentation. In the case of incremental basin operational
expenses, the Bank Loan disbursement would be for the maintenance of works, data processing and
monitoring, materials and equipment repairs. Documentation for SOE expenditures would not be
submitted for review but would be retained by project implementing agencies and DG Budget of MOF
and made available for inspection by the Bank during the course of project supervision. Total
disbursement against SOE would amount to about US$62 million or 40 percent of the Bank Loan amount.
3.          The disbursement profiles of the past investment projects in the irrigation subsector in
Indonesia have stretched up to about eight years. However, the proposed project is not generally
susceptible to delays experienced in completing some past irrigation projects. Its predecessor project
CWJIP (Loan 2649-IND) was completed in about six years; the targeted areas for irrigation development,
detailed in the implementation schedule, are feasible in relation to implementation capacity which exist
in all Java provinces. There may be a slower progress on the ISF and turnover components because of
the magnitude and pace of the programs under the JIWMP compared with the preceding ISSP 11.
However, the Government is strongly committed to implement turnover of small systems, expand
collection of ISF and to the introduction of integrated water resources management in the river basins,
as a matter of policy. With the implementation experience on similar components under ISSP I and 11,
the policy components are expected to be implemented generally on schedule.
4.           The schedule of disbursements for the project, based on of CWJIP (Loan 2649-IND) is
estimated in Table 2, and compared with a standard Indonesian agricultural project profile.

JAVA IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT AND WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
PROJECT
INTRODUCTION OF IRRIGATION SERVICE FEES
1.           Scope. Irrigation Service Fees, applied to schemes which have not been turned over
to WUAs for O&M, are intended to strengthen the institutions for irrigation management, increase
beneficiary participation and ensure that adequate resources are provided for EOM on publicly-
managed irrigation systems. Over time, revenue from ISF should reduce the need for government
O&M funding support and become the leading source of funds for EOM of the main and secondary
systems larger than 500 ha. ISF is being expanded under ISSP II and ADB projects to a target of
about 700,000 ha on Java. The Govermnent has decided, as a matter of policy and social equity, to
quickly implement ISF throughout Java including the POJ area, covering all schemes larger than
500 ha which total about 1.84 million ha. The total new ISF area under the project would, therefore,
be about 1.2 million ha. Not-for-profit, cooperatively-run Waters Users Associations (WUAs) are
socially and administratively empowered to be the primary collection agents for individual farmers.
The Government role would be limited to dealing with WUAs.
2.           Objective and Approach. The objective would be to: introduce ISF in all Java with
progressive increases in ISF levies and targeted improvements in collection efficiency while
containing the cost of ISF collection; strengthen the role of Local Government at Level 1
(supervision) and Level 2 (implementation and sustained management); and create, strengthen and
support effective and functional WUAs for ISF expansion. The legal base is now established in all
provinces on Java, pursuant to MHA decree 39 of 1922, and backed by MHA regulation 12/1992 on
WUAs and organization of local government agencies. The legal base is supported by technical
guidelines and manuals developed under ISSP II. The ISF collection system has also been simplified
with ISF levies to apply for the whole tertiary block and WUAs are empowered and responsible for
collection of ISF from its individual members. Essential to ISF management and sustainability will
be: the establishment of effective and functional WUAs on a full legal footing; training of WUAs in
ISF affairs including financial management and internal sanctions (social and economic pressures) to
ensure payment of dues by WUA members; an adequate level of service by PWRS/cabang dinas with
reasonable accountability to the users; and integration of ISF into the O&M budget process such that
collected fees (net of indivisible primary costs) are channeled to O&M of the scheme from where
collected. The Local Government at the kabupaten level will be the main manager of the program of
implementation and the process will be internalized with much lower Technical Assistance
involvement than under ISSP I and ISSP II. Supervision and oversight would be provided by
DGPUOD. It can be reasonably expected that by the close of the project, nearly all publicly-managed
irrigation systems in Java would have ISF introduced.



-93-                            ANNEX 11
3.           Level and Use of Fees Collected. Current ISF collection rates are Rp 15,000 to
20,000 per ha or about 40 to 55 percent of EOM cost. These would be increased to 80%-100% of
EOM costs by the end of the project. The phasing of increases would depend on individual
circumstances. In the interests of simplicity and stability, they may be only adjusted for inflation in
the first few years which would imply increases in larger steps later on. However, experience has
shown that some kabupatens are able to progressively increase ISF in smaller increments although the
administrative burden is higher for both local government and WUAs. Therefore, discretion would
be allowed at the kabupaten level to accelerate the phase-in of ISF if performance is good and
administrative system readiness is adequate.
4.           Overhead and administration is limited to about 20% of fees. Current ISF levies are
already in the order of 2%-4% of net farm income without allowances for the cost of farm labor.
These fees added to total farmer taxation and it is important that they be calibrated to actual O&M
needs and generate the benefits which inspire good payment performance. A system walk through
with PWRS and the WUA would determine an estimate of a Needs Based Budget (NBB) which would
be used to set ISF. After an initial adjustment period in the first year, no further walk-throughs
would be required until revision of the NBB occurs in three to five years. In the interests of
simplicity and to avoid escalation of estimated costs, the NBB would be kept stable, except for
inflation adjustments, for this period. The overall fee would be based on this NBB and the agreed
total irrigated area. Net of overheads and indivisibles, collected funds would be channeled back to
the areas where collected. Exemptions would continue to be given for non-availability of water, crop
failure, and other justifiable reasons under standardized guidelines. The process of billing and
collection needs to be routinized at the kabupaten level and supported with adequate resources. The
project includes funds for training of officials involved in ISF and of WUAs.
5.           Channeling ISF Collections into the O&M and EOM Budgets. Decree no.
46/1994 of April 23, 1994, which regulates channeling ISF collections into O&M and EOM budgets,
offers a significant improvement over the status quo. It provides for operational budgets for ISF
(APBD II) to be directly allocated through the DIP to Level II, including responsibility for fund
management (Pimbagpro) at Level II. These procedures would be implemented by the Ministry of
Home Affairs starting in FY 1994/95. This will expedite the return of funds in existing projects to
the schemes where collected.
6.           Implementation. GOI has decided that under JIWMP the ISF implementation would
be strongly program-based rather than project-based. At the end of the ISSP II, ISF will have started
in 32 kabupaten on Java, leaving 44 kabupaten without ISF. ISF implementation under JIWMP
would start in 1994/95 and will expand into all 44 remaining kabupatens in the second year
(1995/1996). The preparatory work for this would be covered under ISSP II's last year. The ISF
implementation (new introduction) would be about 250,000 ha per year for the whole Java. ISF
introduction in the irrigation development areas of the project would follow immediately after scheme
rehabilitation/construction is complete. This will be concurrent with the first year of EOM operation
on a scheme following completion of construction. A list of schemes selected for ISF implementation
in 1994/95 was reviewed at negotiations (Table 1). Subsequently, the ISF area would be selected by
Government by October 1 of each year, and submitted to the Bank for review as part of the Annual
Work Program.

Over-all implementation and procedures would be guided by Ministry of Home Affairs Decree No. 98
(July, 1993) on Technical Procedures for Irrigation Service Fees which have been sent to concerned
Provinces and Districts.

7.           Sanctions for Underpayment of ISF. In general, local government, in consultation
with the WUA, should be left to ensure adequate levels of compliance with collection responsibilities.
The WUA has responsibility for the performance of its members, but the government can assist by
disseminating information on actual field experiences in the form of an advisory or guidelines. In
cases of repeated underpayment of ISF fees after rehabilitation where adequate water and services
have been provided and billing is accurate, priority for water availability should be given to tertiary
systems with good payment performance. This may even take the form of reductions proportionate to
underpayment, after review by local government. WUA training and social pressures within the
WUA, as well as ensuring provision of services, should be the first means of promoting a good
payment record. There are instances of WUAs temporarily cutting off access to irrigation water as a
result of individual non-performance or levying penalties or interest charges. The Ministry of Home
Affairs Decree No. 98, referred to in paragraph 6, sets out guidelines for sanctions against non-
payment.

PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL CHARACTERisTCS AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1. Price and Input Assumptions. Per hectare base economic costs of rice
production for rehabilitation schemes are assumed to be as follows, based on data from the Dringo
scheme, Central Java, for mid-1993 conditions:
Per kg or day  Total Input        Total Cost
(RD)                              (Rp'000)
Seeds                       563         35 kg/ha              19.7
Pesticides/herbicides/ha                                      14.9
Fertilizer: Urea            381         250 kg/ha             95.3
Fertilizer: TSP             419          75 kg/ha             31.4
Fertilizer: KCL             388          25 kg/ha             9.7
Maintenance Tertiary Canal/ha                                 5.4
Equip. Rental/Maintenance/ha                                  11.7
Labor/ha                   4,080         75 days/ha          306.9
Transport/ha                                                   5.4
Other/ha                                                       9.9
TOTAL:                                                       510.0
Economic fertilizer prices are based on projected world prices. (Financial prices
assume a continued phasing out of subsidies for TSP and KCL.) Economic labor costs are assumed
to be market costs. Rice prices are average import/export parity prices, projected as follows.
Real Economic Rice Price, Rp/kg
Year 95/96 96/97 97/98 98/99 99/00 00/01 01/02 02/03 03/04
314   310   306   302   298   294   292   290   288
The series drops to Rp 284/kg in 2005/06 and then remains constant.

2. Yield and Cropping Intensity Assumptions.
Expected Yield Increases on Rehabilitated Irrigation Schemes

3.75                   5            15
Expected Cropping Intensity Response from Project on Rehabilitated Schemes
Present Rice + Palawija      Present Rice Intensity (%)   Increase from Project (%)
Intensity (%)          First Season  Second Season        Second Season
250-300                100           100                       0
200-250                100           75                        5
150-200                100           50                       10
125-150                100           25                       15
3. Economoic Rate of Return Matrix for Rehabilitation.
ERR Matrix For Yield and Cropping Intensity Assump2tions
Present Yield (t/ha):       5.50   4.75   4.25   3.75
Cropping Intensity Increase:
0%                  10.9  13.1   17.9  18.1
5%                  13.5  14.7  18.2   18.8
10%                 16.4  16.6  18.3  19.8
15%                 18.4  18.5  20.1  20.8
Salvage values for rehabilitation and turnover were assumed to be 0.5 %/year, or
avoided area losses of 15% over 30 years. Analysis of Turnover Schemes, which assumed only
effects (second season increase from 80% to 100% with project versus a decline to 70% without), and
sensitivity analysis, are available in project files. Average ERRs for rehabilitation were 17% for
rehabilitation and 14.6% for turnover. Table I below summarizes one ERR matrix element for
rehabilitation in the case of 3.75 t/ha initial yields and 0% cropping intensity increases. The ERR in
this example was 18.1 %
