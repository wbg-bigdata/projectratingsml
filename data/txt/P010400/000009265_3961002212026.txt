MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE M%ECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PRCPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA
FOR A SECOND MAHARASHTRA PO1WER PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to India for the equivalent of US$350
million to help finance a Second Maharashtra Power Project. The loan would be
made at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20
years, Including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be
onlent to the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) under the standard terms for
central assistance to the states. GOM will retain US$l million and onlend
US$349 million to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) for 20 years,
including five years of grace, with interest of not less than the prevailing
coupon rate for Government of India (GOI) long-dated securities, currently
12.5X. GOI will bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Sector Background.  Over the past decade, electricity consumption
in India incre4sed at an average annual rate of about 9?, partly as a result
of low retail tariffs that have also largely contributed to the sector's
present financial distress. Despite significant progress in system expansion,
power shortages persist and, in FY92, were equivalent to about 9? of total
electrical energy and 18? of peak capacity requirements. Power supply is
likely to continue to constrain economic growth in India well into the next
century. Unless greater emphasis is placed in future on improving the
efficiency of supply, consumption, and pricing of electricity, continued focus
on supply capacity expansion will aggravate the critical power demand/supply
situation and is likely to be financially unsustainable. A major challenge
for the Government of India (GOI) in the power sector in the 1990s will thus
be to attain a better balance in sector development between supply expansion
and efficiency improvements.
3.        Meeting this challenge will first require bold actions on
institutional arrangements as well as bulk and retail power tariffs, billing
and collection, in a country where responsibilities for managing the sector
are shared between the central government and the states, and where, as a
consequence, electricity has become a highly charged political issue. State
governments have effectively assumed control of most major decisions of the
state utilities, including those on investments, tariffs, borrowings, salary
and personnel policies. The commercialization of the state electricity boards
(SEBs), involving the establishment of a transparent regulatory framework to
provide operational and financial autonomy with accountability for
performance, 5s a prerequisite to improving sector efficiency. The proposed
project addresses these efficiency issues in the state of Maharashtra.
4.        Massive investments in additional capacity will also be required at
a time when budgetary constraints are likely to reduce central government
funding of the sector's investment program. Faced with a growing power gap
and diminishing public resources, GOI has opened the power sector to private
investment and, through amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948,
lifted many of the regulstory disincentives to private investment in the
sector. Maharashtra has already identified two major power generation
projects for implementation by the private sector and is developing its own
private power policy and regulatory framework, within 60I's overall



-2-
guidelinas. A technical assistance program for private power development in
Maharashtra, pas y funded by the Japan Grant Facility (JGF), is being
implemented as p    of the proposed project and will help Maharashtra contract
with private deve. pers for the two above-mentioned projects.
5.        Lessons from Previous Bank Operations.  The Bank has financed the
Chandrapur Thermal Power Project (Ln. 2544-IN) and the Maharashtra Power
Project (Ln. 3096-IN) to help MSEB expand its generation, transmission and
distribution facilities, renovate and modernize existing power plants, and
enhance its capabilities in many areas of utility operation, management and
project implementation. Both projects have encountered difficulties in the
early stages of their implementation due, to a large extent, to the slow pace
of procurement. More recently however, MSEB's extensive use of model bidding
documents approved by the Bank has improved the situation considerably. Funds
available under the first project are practically fully comnitted and most of
the outstanding balance is expected to be disbursed in FY93. Bidding for the
part of the Mahsrashtra Power Project executed by MSEB is almost complete and
funds will be fully committed by end-1992; savings of about US$46 million have
already been identified and GOI has requested the Bank to cancel an equivalent
amount from the loan. Similar progress has been achieved on the part of the
project implemented by GOM. Compliance with loan covenants has generally been
satisfactory. The lessons learned from these projects have had an important
bearing on the preparation of the proposed project, particularly as regards
the need to improve MSEB's procurement procedures and increase its self-
financing capabilities.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project helps implement the
Bank's lending strategy for the power sector, which supports development of
private utilities as well as central sector and state utilities that
demonstrate a firm commitment to improve their operational performance and
finances. The Bank's continued association with MSEB and GOM will ensure that
the long-term process of financial, operational and managerial improvements
initiated by HSEB under previous operations, and Maharashtra's stated policy
of focussing on efficiency improvements as a priority area in MSEB's future
development are fully implemented. Proposed generation and rural
electrification investments have been cut in MSEB's investment plan and
several major programs and projects have been initiated to reduce system
losses and improve operational efficiency. They include: (a) distribution
reinforcement and expansion in the main urban centers; (b) distribution master
plans for the 32 districts in Maharashtra, leading into an accelerated
distribution reinforcement program for selected areas; (c) major increases in
residential and commercial electricity tariff rates and a 40Z reduction in
SEBe's target for the annual number of agricultural pump connections, to
contain the growth in demand and reduce the financial burden of supply to
these consumer groups; and (d) rehabilitation and renovation of MSEB's
existing generating stations (also involving environmental improvements).
Significant adjustments in MSEB's electricity tariff structure have been
recently introduced and will be pursued during project implementation.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the project are to: (a)
support operational efficiency improvements; (b) improve internal and external
resource mobilization through the introduction of internal cash generation
targets for NSEB and external cofinancing; and (c) promote institutional
reforms, including the review of the long-tenm institutional development of
Maharashtra's power sector and direct support to GOM for the finalization of
two major private power projects.

8.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project comprisess (a) the
construction of the last stage of Chandrapur thermal power station by the
addition of a 500-MW coal-fired unit; (b) the construction of a + 500-kV,
1,500-MW HVDC line from Chandrapur to Padghe, near Bombay (about 735 km), and
the related termival stations; (c) the implementation of the accelerated
distribution reinforcement program aimed at reducing losses in selected areas;
and (d) consulting services in the following four areas: (i) load research and
preparation of electricity demand management measures; (ii) development of
MSEB's environmental management capabilities at the corporate level; (iii)
preparation of private power projects in Maharashtra ; and (iv) institutional
review of the power sector in Maharashtra.
9.        Prolect Implementation.  The proposed project would be carried out
by MSEB, with the assistance of qualified consultants. The project cost is
estimated at US$957 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$545 million equivalent (57Z) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$72
million equivalent. The total financing required, including interest during
construction, is US$1,224 million equivalent, of which the Bank would finance
US$350.0 million equivalent C4Z of the foreign exchange requirements and 27Z
of the total). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 10604-IN, dated June 3, 1992, is being distributed
separately.
10.       Environmental and Resettlement Aspects.  The environmental impact
of the proposed project is in line with standards acceptable to the Bank. A
su1mary of the environmental assessment carried out during project preparation
was distributed to the Executive Directors on February 28, 1992. Ground level
air quality, S0O and NO, emissions and thermal discharge of Chandrapur, with
all seven units in operation and burning the worst quality of coal, would
remain in compliance with GOI, GOM and Bank guidelines. Liquid effluents will
be treated and neutralized in a waste water treatment plant and will be
recycled for ash disposal purposes. Transmission and distribution facilities
will be designed and constructed in accordance with practices that will ensure
minimum disturbance to the environment. The route for the 736-km long
transmission line has been selected so that only 7.8 km infringes on forest
land. MSEB will bear the cost of compensatory afforestation, for which land
has already been identified. The proposed project also will entail a
component to strengthen MSEB's environmental management capabilities.
11.       While the proposed extension of the Chandrapur power station, the
BVDC link and the accelerated distribution reinforcement program do not
involve any displacement of population, the construction of units 5 and 6 led
to the displacement of about 800 families, some of which remain to be fully
resettled and rehabilitated. GOM has agreed to complete their resettlement
and rehabilitation within a period of about 18 months.
12.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, GOM and MSEB agreed thats (a)
MSEB's net internal cash generation will be no less than 202 of average
capital expenditures in FY93 and FY94, and 252 from FY95 onvwards; (b) MSEB's
rate of return will be no less than 4.5? from FY93 onwards; (c) MSEB will
furnish to the Bank annual revisions to its five-year revolving capital
investment program and the associated financing plan, not later than December



-4-
31 of each year; td) customer receivables and commercial payables will remain
within set limits; (e) MSEB will implement various environmental mitigatory
measures at Chandrapur; (f) GOM will discuss with the Bank the findiAgs and
recommendatioas of a high-level commission established to examine the
institutional development of Maharashtra's power sector, not later than
December 31, 1993;  and (g) GOM and MSEB will carry  ut jointly with the Bank
a mid-term review, during the third year of the project, to assess overall
progress in the physical exicution of the project and MSEB's new efficiency-
oriented investment plan, and the implementation of the programs for
electricity demand management, tariff reform and private sector power
development in Maharashtra. Finalization of the financial arrangements for
the acquisition and installation of the HYDC terminals and fulfilment of the
conditions for final forest clearance are conditions of loan effectiveness.
13.       Project Benefits.  The main benefits of the project ares (a) an
increase in power supply in Maharashtra; (b) further improvements in MSEB's
operational efficiency; (c) strengthening of its finances and of its
managerial autonomy; (d) impro,emerts in the quality of service in
Maharashtra; (e) more economic use of generating capacity through better
pricing policies, demand management and loss reduction measures; (f) reduced
reliance on the central government for financing investment requirements by
increasing MSEB's self-financing capabilities and improving external resource
mobilization as well as facilitating private sector investments; and (g)
strengthening of MSEB's environmental impact management capability.
14.       Risks.  The project does not pose any particular technical risks,
in view of the proven designs and engagement of well-qualified consultants to
assist MSEB in project implementation. The main project risks relate to: (a)
the availability of supplier financing for the HVDC link, on reasonable terms;
(b) a slow procurement process; and (c) the pace at which tariff and other
institutional reforms will be implemented. These risks will be minimized by:
(a) assisting MSEB in preparing the tender documents for the HVDC link to help
obtain the most attractive financing offers; (b) having finalized during
project preparation a model bid document, contract packages and the associated
procurement plan; (c) having the first tariff adjustment, involving major
improvements in the structure of tariffs as well as a significant increase in
their level, implemented before Board presentation; (d) establishing realistic
targets for MSEB's financial performance and the implementation of further
tariff adjustments, demand management measures and institutional reforms; and
(e) providing tecbnical assistance to help MSEB and GOM implement these
measures.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
