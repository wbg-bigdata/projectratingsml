REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:         Government of COte dl'voire
Amount:           US$150.0 million equivalent
Terms:            20 years including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate
Loan Description: The proposed Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) will
provide continuing support for Government's medium-term program
of reforms in the agricultural sector, within the framework
of its ongoing Structural Adjustment Program.   The main
objective of the agricultural adjustment program is to achieve
in the medium-term in the sector a sustained rate of growth
of about 4Z per annum while reducing urban-rural and regional
income disparities.
Measures will be taken to (a) improve the domestic terms of
trade in favor of agriculture; (b) shift incentives in favor
of crops with high comparative advantage (coffee and export
diversification crops), away from crops that have declining
economic benefits to Cote d'Ivoire such as cocoa; (c) decrease
costs  in  the  agro-industrial  sector  to  resto.e  its
competitiveness on domestic and external markets; (d) reduce
public sector involvement in directly productive activities
and increase the efficiency of parastatals providing basic
support services to farmers; (e) reorient public expenditures
toward high priority activities in rural areas; (f) improve
rural financial intermediation and farmers' access to savings
and credit facilities; and (g) improve the management of the
country's natural resources, in particular by promoting the
protection and sustainable exploitation of natural forests.
In order to sustain agricultural growth in the medium and long-
term, at about 42 p.a., a second phase will have to include
measures which increase the competitiveness of Ivorian
agriculture through a real exchange rate change. This would
reduce the relative cost of non-tradables in agricultural
production (mostly labor and marketing costs) while increasing
the value of sales of crops which are tradable internationally
(both agricultural exports and import substitutes).
The present Agricultural Adjustment Program, summarized in
Government's Letter of Agricultural Policy (Appendix 1), is
central to Government'a strategy, recently endorsed by the IMF,
to stabilize the economy and to reverse recent declines in GDP,
in order to set the stage for sustainable growth in the medium-
term. The Loan (with its cofinancing) will finance about 10?
of C8te d'Ivoire's projected overall public finance gap of CPAF
1,300 billion (about US$4.17 billion equivalent) during the
1989-90 period. The remainder of this gap will be financed
through other sector and project loans put together by the
donors, and by the DMP.



- ii -
Benefits
and Risks: The reforms introduced under the loan are expected to foster economic
growth of 2? p.a. from 1990-95, an increase from the poor performance
of about -1.5? p.a. during 1980-88.   Agricultural growth would
increase to about 46 p.a. if the program is further deepened in the
medium-tenm  with  real  exchange  rate  adjustment.        Improved
agricultural growth would increase the cou.ntry's overall annual
economic growth rate by a full 12. Growth would benefit primarily
the rural population (55? of the country's total population) which
comprises most of the country's poor. Rural incomes would increase
due to improved labor and land productivity and reduced agricultural
taxation. This in turn would have a positive poverty alleviation
effect in urban areas by slowing down migration to cities where
employment opportunities are increasingly scarce. Large net public
savings would result from improved domestic resource mobilization
and streamlined public expenditures affecting the agricultural
sector.   Positive balance of payment effects would stem from
increased production of export crops (coffee, rubber and other export
diversification crops) and import substitutes (food crops and animal
products).
Risks relate to possible social and political pressures to slow down
or stall reforms, unpredictable developments in the external
environment (particularly the world price of the country's main
export crops) and the level and speed of the private sector response
to incentives.  These risks are limited by Government's commitment
to the msin objectives of the macro and sector adjustment programs,
caused in part by the need to avoid the bleak economic and social
consequences of the 'without adjustment' scenario.   The private
sector is already more active in Cote d'Ivoire than in most African
countries and has proven in the past to be responsive to incentives
and opportunities.
Estimated
Disbursements: The ASAL would be disbursed in three tranches of an equal amount
(US$50.0 million each) over a period of about 12 months: the first
tranche at effectiveness November 1989; the second tranche around
April 1990 and the third tranche around November 1990, after
implementation of agreed-upon measures.   These measures include
satisfactory progress in the implementation of the overall
macroeconomic and sectoral reform programs. A maximum of US$30.0
million would be disbursed against payments made up to four months
before loan signing.
Appraisal
Report:     This is a combined President's and Staff Appraisal Report. A detailed
Technical Support Volume is available on request.
Cofinancing:    The African Development Bank and the Government of Japan will
cofinance the proposed ASAL with loans equivalent to US$150.0 million
and US$50.0 million respectively.  The French Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) will parallel finance the operation,
with a loan of about US$20.0 million equivalent to support the
restructuring of the agricultural credit bank (BNDA).

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Loan for
the equivalent of US$150.0 million to the Republic of COte d'Ivoire to help
finance an agricultural sector adjustment program. This program is described
in a Letter of Agricultural Development Policy dated March 2, 1988 received from
the Government (Appendix 1). The Loan will have a term of 20 years, including
5 years of grace,  at the standard variable  interest rate.   The African
Development Bank (AfDB), the Japanese Government (OECF) and the French Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) have also announced their intention
to extend loans of US$150.0 million equivalent, US$50.0 million and US$20.0
million equivalent respectively in support of this program.
PART I. THE ECONOMY
A. Background
2.      With a GNP per capita of US$680 in 1988, COte d'Ivoire ranks well ahead
of its neighbors in the West African Region. Its population of 11.5 million is
growing at an annual rate estimated at 3.5Z (1980-88), partly because of high
immigration from neighboring countries. Since independence in 1960, the country
has enjoyed a remarkable degree of political stability which, combined with
favorable resource endowments and a steady inflow of cheap labor, has fostered
rapid economic development. In its Report No. 1147-IVC 'Ivory Coast - A Basic
Economic Report", circulated in May 1977 (published in 1978 under the title
"Ivory Coast - The Challenge of Success"), the Bank presented an in-depth
analysis of the country's striking economic performance during its first 15 years
of independence. During the period extending to the mid 19708, the GDP grew at
a real average annual rate of 7.72, without major internal or external
macroeconomic imbalances.
3.      During the second half of the 19709, however, the economy of Cote
d'Ivoire experienced a succession of external shocks, including a coffee and
cocoa boom from 1975 to 1977, a rapid deterioration in the market for these
commodities from 1977 to 1979 and a sharp increase in import prices in 1979.
At the same time, macroeconomic and sectoral policies pursued by the Government
progressively deteriorated. Following the rapid increase in the revenues of the
Agricultural Stabilization Fund (CSSPPA) generated by the boom in coffee and
cocoa prices in the 1975-77 period, the Government embarked on an overambitious
public investment program mainly directed toward large projects with high unit
costs and low economic returns. Public investments almost tripled in real terms



2
between 1976 and 1980. When stabilization revenues started to dwiudle after
197t, the Government relied heavily on foreign borrowing and money supply
expansion to finance its investment program, leading to a rapid acceleration oi
domestic inflation. The result, with a fixed exchange rate vis-a-vis the French
Franc, was an intensification of competition from imports which was met by
increased tariff and non-tariff import restrictions. This, in turn, induced a
growing anti-export bias, which further aggravated the discrimination against
export agriculture and industry. The economic indicators for C6te d'Ivoire are
presented in Annex I.
4.      By 1980, the overall deficits of the public sector and the balance of
payments reached 12? and 172 of GDP respectively. Medium- and long-term debt
outstanding (PPG) had climbed to 42, of GDP from 182 in 1975. Economic growth
came to a halt and COte d'Ivoire had exhausted its external reserves. More
details on the national accounts and the balance of payment are presented in
Annex II.
B. Launching the Structural Adjustment Process (1981-86)
5.      In 1981, the Government launched a Structural Adjustment Program to
restore macroeconomic equilibria and lay the basis for the resumption of stable
growth. The focus of the program was on internal demand adjustment and the
initiation of structural reforms to restore growth.   Public investment was
reduced from an average of 15t of GDP between 19'Z and 1982 to 6? of GDP in 1986-
88 largely by reducing low priority investments. In addition, the parastatal
sector uas substantially restructured and a broad range of fiscal measures
implemented to increase revenue. Monetary policy was tightened. Mersures were
also taken to improve the most obvious distortions in the system of economic
incentives and a tariff-cum export subsidy scheme was introduced in 1986 to
compensate for the real exchange rate overvaluation. Adjustment policies under
the SAL process significantly increased resource shifts to tradables through
rising agricultural producer prices while public sector wages were declining in
real terms. Finally, a four year rescheduling (MYRA) was agreed upon in 1986
to reduce the external debt burden. The program was supported by three SALs from
the Bank in 1981, 1983 and 1986 and by an EFF and two stand-by agreements from
the IMF in 1981, 1984 and 1986. Partly due to the program and partly due to very
favorable international prices for coffee and cocoa, macroeconomic equilibria
were temporarily restored in 1985/86. The economy grew at 5? in real terms in
1985.  With GDP rising again by 3.6? in 1986, the country appeared to have
entered a growth phase compatible with public finance and balance of payments
equilibria. However, these favorable developments masked only temporarily the
economy's continuing structural weaknessess high debt service obligations, a
heavy dependence on the price of a few primary commodities, high public sector
spending and an appreciating real exchange rate.
C. Recent Developments (1987-89)
6.      Macroeconomic improvements were short-lived and the economic situation
quickly deteriorated in 1987 and 1988. The steady decline in the world market
prices of agricultural products (in particular of cocoa, C6te d'Ivoire's main
export commodity), combined with expansionary fiscal policies, were the main
causes of continuing economic difficulties. As world prices fell below domestic
support prices, the Stabilization Fund (CSSPPA) started incurring substantial
losses for the first time in its history.   The budgetary situation,  in
equilibrium in 1985 and 1986, moved to a deficit of 6.0? and 13.5? of GDP in 1987



3
and 1988 respectively.  These deficits were financed by the accumulation of
dowestic and foreign arrears, which led to a serious liquidity crisis and the
loss of private sector confidence. As a result, private investment fell to 72
of GDP, and GDP declined by 2.72 in 1987 and 3.72 in 1988.
7.      During 1988, believing the fall in the world cocoa prices to be
temporary, the authorities were reluctant to adjust domestic support prices for
the major export commodities to reflect world market conditions. For cocoa, they
embarked on a strategy aimed at driving up world prices by stockpiling, which
led only a temporary to a rise in the cocoa price. As record cocoa crops in Cate
d'Ivoire, Malaysia, Nigeria and Ghana were confirmed for 1988-89, signaling a
foiurth consecutive annual surplus on world markets, COte d'Ivoire's withholding
strategy collapsed under the pressure of market forces and world prices dropped.
The corresponding terms of trade losses precipitated the mounting financial
crisis with fast increasing internal and external imbalances. Domestic arrears
increased to CFA. 383 billion (nearly 132 of GDP) by June 1989, putting the
country's financial system in jeopardy. It was projected that, in the absence
of drastic adjustments, the 1989 total fiscal deficit would reach about 182 of
GDP (CSSPPA's deficit alone reaching close to 52 of GDP), which would imply a
financing gap of about CFAF 800 billion (US$2.6 billion) before the rescheduling
of the external debt. Faced with this situation, the Government has decided to
take far reaching corrective measures which have lead to the preparation of a
Fund financial and economic adjustment program to be supported by the Fund, and
three sector adjustment programs propcsed for Bank support.
D. Medium-Term Prospects and Government Strategy (1989-94)
Medium-Term Outlook
8.      In spite of its current difficulties, COte d'Ivoire has a large potential
for growth over the medium- to long-term. Its rich agricultural resources in
particular allow for diver-_xication of production and exports, and provide a
solid basis for indu-t-;alization. However, the present unfavorable external
environment is expected to continue over the next few years, due to the poor
prospects for recovery of the prices of coffee and cocoa, the country's main
exports, and the lack of competitiveness in many productive sectors resulting
from the overvalued real exchange rate. In addition, the external debt overhang
constitutes a major obstacle to the resumption of economic growth.
9.      The return to a dynamic and stable growth path will require major changes
in the incentive and regulatory frameworks, and in the price of non-tradables
relative to tradables. Future growth must be supported by a higher level of
private investment, which has been inhibited in recent years by a limited access
to foreign borrowing and COte d'Ivoire's ongoing economic and financial
difficulties.    Measures  to  enhance  savings  mobilization  and ensure  the
availability of credit to private investors are essential to economic recovery,
as are reforms to improve the incentive environment. A recenit reform program
adopted by the UMOA (West Africa Monetary Union) (paras 18 and 19) includes
significant measures to raise and unify interest rates, to limit guaranteed
credit to the public sector, to promote domestic financial savings, and to
establish a disciplined system of commercial bank supervision. While the above
domestic reforms are essential, resumption of growth cannot be achieved without
extraordinary financial assistance from the country's major external partners,
to reduce the debt burden and free resources for productive investments.



4
The Reform Programs and Policy Agents
10.     The Government's recovery strategy is to be implemented in phases.  The
first and immediate task is to reduce domestic and external financial imbalances
through the implementation of the 18-month economic and financial program
prepared in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank in July 1989, and
scheduled to be submitted to the IMF Board in October 1989. The second task is
to put in place concomitantly a series of structural adjustment measures
necessary for long-term sustainable growth.
11.     The adjustment program agreed with the DMP envisages a reduction of the
budget deficit of CFAF 146 billion from a projected 17.1? of GDP in 1989 (without
reforms) to 8.2a in 1990. This is to be achieved by three sets of measures:
- reduction in central government spending,
- improved resource mobilization, and
- elimination of CAISSTAB's deficit.
In addition, structural reforms have been elaborated in three sectoral adjustment
programs covering the agriculture. energy and water sectors, which have been
negotiated  and  fully agreed bet:-~.en  the Government  and the Bank.    The
comprehensive package of measures that the Government has implemented, or plans
to implement, is summarized in the attached matrix (Atppendix 2).
12.     Reduction in Government Spending.   The target is to reduce central
government current expenditure by CFAF 31 billion, equivalent to 10X of non-
interest current spending on an annual basis.  These savings will come from
special accounts and from spending on material and equipment. The Authorities
will not at this junction reduce civil serv..ce remuneration, judging such action
to entail too great a political risk. Such a measure will be considered in 1990,
if the political climate appears more propitious. At first, it could take the
form of a reduction in fringe benefits and in the number of civil servants.
13.     The investment budget will be reduced by CFAF 37 billion in 1990 compared
to 1989, corresponding to a CFAF 15 billion reduction in the financing gap as
it implies lower drawings on foreign loans. This will bring the already low
level of government investment, 4.7? of GDP in 1988, to a very modest 2.4? of
GDP in 1989. This measure is considered temporary; the Government has already
reduced investment in successive budgets since 1981 mainly by cutting low
priority projects. A further reduction in the level of public investment is
clearly incompatible with the objective of resuming growth. Public investment
is projected to recover to about 42 of GDP after 1992, and focuses on priority
investments which are included in the objectives of the three sectoral adjustment
loans (ASAL, WASAL, ESAL).
14.     Improved Resource Mobilization.   Recently introduced measures  are
expected to yield an additional CFAP 41 billion in the second semester of 1989.
This will be achieved through improved collections rather than changes in rates.
Domestic tax revenue, direct and indirect, is projected to increase by CFAF 22
billion, an 82 increase on an annual basis. A more systematic use is being made
of withholding as a means of tax collection, and the tax department's material
and human resources are being augmented. Trade taxes are expected to yield an
extra CFAP 9 billion over the next six months, an increase of about 4? on an
annual basis. This will be achieved through the introduction of a 10? minimum



5
tariff to be applied on all imports, except those entering under the temporary
admission scheme. This measure will affect goods that currently benefit from
ad hoc exemptions; tariffs on other goods vill be unaffected. Other revenue
representing mainly transfers from public enterprises to contribute to the
servicing of guaranteed debt, is expected to provide a further CFAF 17 million,
while an additional CFAF 2 billion will come from efficiency improvements in the
Caisse de P4r6quation, the public entity responsible for the domestic marketing
of rice and sugar.
15.     Reduce the CAISSTAB Deficit.  This is both crucial to the stabilization
program over the next 18 months and consistent with the agricultural
diversification objectives set out in the ASAL. The Government has approved a
reduction of coffee and cocoa producer prices which, together with projected
savings in marketing costs for the two commodities, would reduce the CAISSTAB
deficit by about CFAF 53 b'llion in 1989. Details of the agricultural adjustment
measures are set out in Part IV below.
16.     Other Stabilization Measures. Actions approved by the Government in the
framework of the stabilization and sectoral adjustment programs include: (a) the
reduction of domestic arrears estimated at CFAF 383 billion (about US$1.3
billion) in 1989, and by CFAF 100 billion (US$330 million) in 1990; (b) the
establishment of a task force by the end of 1989 to elaborate a program for the
elimination of cross payments arrears between the Government, the parastatals
and the banking system; and (c) the continuation of a tight monetary and credit
policy with efforts to increase private domestic savings mobilization, and
improve the net external position of the monetary authorities.
17.     Industrial Sector and Trade Policy Reforms.  Under previous SALs, the
Government had reformed its trade policy, especially in the industrial sector.
Measures included a tariff reform that aimed at making effective protectior
uniform across industries and at introducing a value added based export subsidy
to provs4e equal incentives to exports.  Neither of these reforms appear to have
fully achieved the desired objectives because of (a) enterprise-specific
preferential tariffs and other exemptions on the import side, and (b) the
selective rather than general nature of the export subsidy scheme. Also, because
of the acute budgetary situation, payments to exporters were suspended in
November 1988.   The Government is acutely aware of the shortcomings of the
present incentive system and C6te d'Ivoire's deteriorating competitiveness.
Accordingly, an Interministerial Commission for the Study of Factor Costs has
been created. This Commission has responsibility for elaborating an action plan
to redress the situation. The action plan will be based, inter alia, on a set
of Bank- and UNDP-supported studies on competitiveness, the regulatory framework,
and the labor market. These studies should be completed and the ensuing action
plan prepared by the end of 1989.
18.     Monetary and Banking Sector Reforms.  In the area of monetary policy the
IWOA has recently adopted a sweeping series of basic reforms vhich will shift
Central Bank intervention to indirect instruments of monetary control, promote
savings, and create a uniform market-based interest rate structure. Bank margins
will be widened and preferential interest rates abolished.  Crop marketing
credits and loans benefiting from government guarantees will no longer receive
preferential treatment with respect to interest rates or access to bank credits
(hitherto a major cause of liquidity problems for the banking system).

19.     The Central Bank's oversight and control of the banking system will be
substantially strengthened with a view to avoiding bank failures of the past.
The Central Bank will directly participate in the rehabilitation of banks in
difficulty through the consolidation of unpaid overdrafts and the coordination
of its policies with national adjustment programs containing financial sector
reforms.
20.     Energy Sector Adjustment.  The energy sector adjustment program aims to
attract private capital for resumption of oil and gas exploration and to increase
returns on energy sector investments, thereby restoring financial self-
sufficiency to this sector. For the electricity utility (EECI), the aims consist
of a 25Z reduction in annual operating expenses, new budgeting and payment
procedures to improve revenue collection, and an overhaul of financial and
operating procedures. In hydrocarbons, the contractual framework for exploration
and production will be made more attractive, a new offshore oil field will be
developed by a consortium led by Exxon.   Also, international firms will be
invited to develop an offshore gas field using foreign equity financing, and the
oil refinery costs will be reduced in conjunction with a revision of consumer
prices for petroleum products.  An energy conservation program will also be
launched.
21.     Water and Sanitation Sector Adjustment.  The water and sanitation sector
adjustment program will reduce and realign water costs so as to improve
industrial competitiveness and benefit low-income   nsumers, while reducing the
heavy fiscal burden arising from the amortization of the heavy investments of
the last decade. The program includes: (a) restructuring the finances of the
sector to reduce annual debt service charges; (b) reducing the industrial water
rate by 20?; (c) transferring maintenance responsibility for 2500 water points
to villagers; and (d) limiting investments to projects with good economic
prospects.

22.     ProsRects.  The realignment of domestic prices of agricultural products
with world prices, together with improvements of public expenditure programs*
will substantillly reduce the budget defict and contribute to the stabilization
of the economy.  As indicated in Table 1, changes in pricing and investment
policies in the agricultural and energy sectors, as well as banking sector
reform, will have a positive effect on economic growth beginning in 1990. The
proposed Agricultural Sector Operation, which is the object of the report, will
directly sustain this trend, together with the Fund program. The policy changes
implemented during this first phase will also establish the foundation for a
second stage of growth in the range of 4 to 5s per annum, and a return to
creditworthiness, whose achievement will require real exchange rate devaluation.
This can occur either through nominal exchange rate devaluation or through wage
and price reducing policies.   An additional element necessary to move the
adjustment process to the second stage is donor financial support. Bank and Fund
involvement at this stage is also geared toward catalyzing the necessary amount
of external support. Without this presence, sufficient external support would
not be forthcoming. Dialogue with the Ivoirian authorities in preparation for
the second stage of the adjustment process has already begun and will become more
intense over the next 12 months, during which time a complete medium-term program
will have to be worked out and agreed upon. Depending on the progress made during
this period in the stabilization program as well as in the formulation of a
medium-term program, the Bank will decide whether to increase its financial
support through the two SECALs referred to above.
23.     The  financing  plan  shown  in  Table  2  indicates  total  financing
requirements of the order of US$4 billion in 1989-90. The residual gap after
presently available financing and debt rescheduling and reduction, will be equal
to US$450 million. A Donors Conference will be held on October 9 and 10 to
present the programs and to mobilize the financing necessary. Submission of the
new stand-by agreement to the IMF Board in the amount of SDR 149 million (CFAF
61 billion), representing Cote d'Ivoire's quota, will depend upon satisfactory
assurances that the residual g8- will be filled. Correspondingly, a satisfactory
overall public finance plan including the filling of the residual gap, and
covering the period through the end of 1990, is a condition of Board presentation
of the Bank loan for the ASAL.

PART II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COTE D'IVOIRE
24.      Since 1968, when Bank Group operations in COte d'Ivoire started, lending
has expanded rapidly and now includes 59 operations totalling about US$1,915
million, including US$14.0 million from the Third Window and an IDA credit of
US$7.5 million.   Of these, 21 have been for agriculture, supporting cotton,
cocoa, rubber, forestry, oil palm and coconut development, and rural development
in the North-East Savanna and Center-West Regions. There were six road projects
and two highway sector projects.   The remaining loans were for education,
telecommunications, the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system, water supply, urban
development, petroleu- exploration and development, power distribution, tourism
development, small- and medium-scale enterprises, a regional cement project, a
regional railway project, an industrial finance and development project, a health
and demographic project, and structural adjustment and related technical
assistance. IFC has supported textile, fertilizers, flour milling, development
banking and agricultural plantation operations. In general, implementation of
Bank projects has been satisfactory. Statement of Bank Group operations in COte
d'Ivoire are presented in Annex IV.
25.      Until the early 1980s, Bank lending was project-oriented, with the
emphasis on agricultural diversification, infrastructure development and
education. The deterioration of the country's economic situation in the 1980s



9
led to a substantial shift in the direction of Bank lending toward the support
of the Government's adjustment program which has been supported by three
Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs) from the Bank and by direct support to
productive sectors (agriculture, industry and energy). Provided the Government
embarks upon and further strengthens the recently initiated financial and
economic adjustment program, the Bank intends to continue to provide a mix of
policy based and high priority investment lending.
26.     Past  Bank  operations  in  agriculture  have  emphasized  (a)  export
development and diversification; (b) promotion of economically viable food crop
production; and (c) smallholder agriculture and the reduction of regional income
disparities. There are six ongoing agricultural projects: a Center-West Regional
Development  Project   (Ln  2167-IVC)   promoting  smallholder  coffee/cocoa
rehabilitation and bottomland development; Fourth and Fifth Rubber Projects (Ln
2323-IVC and Ln 2874-IVC) for the development of smallholder rubber plantations;
a Second Forestry Project (Ln 2496-IVC) financing industrial plantations and the
preparation of a National Forestry Plan; a Fifth Oil Palm Project (Ln 2627-IVC)
with a strong smallholder component; and an Agricultural Extension Project (Ln
2765-IVC) aimed at reorganizing the extension services of the country's main
development agencies along the lines of the training and visit (T&V) system.
Implementation of Bank-financed agricultural projects has in general been
satisfactory and has steadily improved over the past five years. The projects
are expected to achieve, and in certain cases exceed, their developmental
objectives.
27.     Bank lending in agriculture will continue to give high priority to
subsectors with clear comparative advantage and with export diversification
prospects. In addition, emphasis will be placed on strengthening agricultural
services (research, extension, credit and input supply) to promote widespread
productivity gains. The Bank will support the Government's efforts to halt the
rapid degradation of natural forests and to introduce a more rational and
sustainable management of the country's natural resource base through a Forestry
Sector Project, just negotiated (July 1989). Bank lending will also give high
priority to the improvement of rural living conditions through the financing of
programs to upgrade basic infrastructure (rural roads, water supply) and social
services (health, education) in rural areas.   A companion operation to the
present Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan, the Rural Sector Support Project,
is currently being appraised. It would finance the studies and pilot operations
included in the Letter of Agricultural Development Policy (Appendix 1). These
pilot operations would set the stage for future full-fledged projects in the
areas of cooperative development, rural savings and credit operations, and the
development of women's role in agriculture. In addition, an Agricultural Export
Promotion and Diversification Project, a National Agricultural Services
(Extension and Research) Project, and a Young Farmers Settlement Project are at
an advanced stage of preparation by the Government as part of the Agricultural
Adjustment Program. Finally, several projects are at their identification stage
for possible future Bank financing (rural credit, livestock sector, feeder road,
land tenure, and small rural infrastructure projects). Like in all lending to
C6te d'Ivoire, the Bank will use its role as a catalyst and seek to associate
other cofinancers with its lending.

PART III. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Main Features
28.   The agricultural sector contributes about 35? of the country's total GDP
and 80? of its export revenues. It provides employment for about two-thirds
of the national work force and generates substantial fiscal revenues.
Agriculture has provided the basis for much of the development of the
country's industrial and service sectors.
29.   Ecological Zones and Land Use.  C6te d'Ivoire is endowed with rich but
unequally distributed agricultural resources. The total land area of 320,000
km2 can be divided into two regions with different ecologies, farming systems,
and demographic characteristicst the Forest Region (about 140,000 km2) in the
South where the main sources of growth have been concentrated and the drier
Savanna Region (about 180,000 km2) in the North. With high rainfall and good
soils, the forest region has a richer resource base than the savanna. Dense
tropical forests, which once covered 16 million hectares, provided the initial
impetus for growth in the region. Most of them have been replaced by tree
crops, bush and secondary forest, leaving only about 3 million ha in forest
reserves and national parks. The much higher returns from forest region
agriculture have induced rapid immigration into the region, thereby creating
threats to forest resources and the ecology. With increasing population
pressure, land availability constraints are beginning to emerge in the forest
zone. The average farm size (about 6 ha) is nevertheless higher than in the
savanna (3.6 ha) due mainly to the presence of tree crops. Cocoa and coffee
(about 2.5 million ha) occupy two-thirds of the total crop area and dominate
the forest region's economy. Annual food crops (rice, maize, yams, plantains
and cassava) account for about 251 of the cropped area, while other tree crops
(oil palm, coconut and rubber) and industrial crops (banana and pineapples)
cover about 5?.
30.     Agro-climatic conditions in the savanna are riskier than in the forest
region, with lower and more unreliable annual rainfalls. Soils are generally
light and of medium to poor quality. Savanna farming is based on annual crops
in pure or mixed stand. A third of the farmers grow rainfed cotton. Maize is
the dominant crop (about 26? of the total cropped area) followed by yams (24X),
cotton (16Z), rice (13?), sorghumlmillet (9?), groundnut (7Z), and cassava (4?).
31.     Demographic Characteristics.   COte d'ivoirel'  rural population is
estimated at 6.1 million (55? of the total population), of which 4.0 million in
the forest region and 2.1 million in the savanna. The number of farming families
is estimated at about 500,000 in the forest region and 300,000 in the savanna.
Past population growth in the savanna has been low (less than 1? p.a.) and may
have been negative in some areas due to migration to the forest region. By
contrast, rural population in the forest has grown at about 2.8? p.a. over the
past decade. Agricultural population density is generally low in the savanna
(12 persons/kms) where land resources are not a constraint in most areas. The
forest region, except in the southwest, is much more densely populated (over 25
personslkmz in most prefectures), with land shortage becoming a constraint. The
emergence of localized land constraints still tends to result in migration rather



11
than in intensification of agricultural practices. However, land scarcity will
become an increasing force for the adoption of more intensive agricultural
practices.
B. Production and Comparative Advantage
32.     Structure of Production.    During  the  1965-84  period,  agricultural
production grew at an average annual rate of 4.6Z in real terms, i.e., at about
double the rate of the rural population increase. This expansion was led by
export crops and timber, the production of which grew at about 72 p.a. Food and
livestock production grew at a relatively slower pace of 3.5X p.a. This growth
rate differential resulted in a gradual shift in the structure of agricultural
production as shown in Table 3 below:
Table 3: Structure of Agricultural Production (1965-84)
(2 of value of total production)
1965-69         1970-74          1980-84
Export Crops                    34              38                48

Total                        100             100              100
33.     Foodcrops and animal products represented about 55Z of total agricultural
production in the mid-1960s, but their share had declined to less than 452 by
the mid-1980s. Cash crop production has been increasingly dominated by cocoa
and coffee, with cocoa asserting its dominance in the last decade. Other export
crops (oil palm, rubber, cotton, coconut, pineapples and bananas) averaged a
combined growth of close to 102 over the 1965-84 period but, starting from a very
small base, increased only slightly their share of total production.
34.     Table 3 also suggests potential sources for future agricultural growth.
The timber sector is fast declining. For food crops, local demand is likely to
be the upper limit for future production. A future growth of about 42 p.a. may
be expected with an appropriate policy environment.   Such a rate would be
substantially higher than the expected rate of growth of the agricultural
population (2.52 p.a.) and requires sustained increases in labor and land
productivity through the adoption of new technologies. Fast growth in export
diversification crops is possible with an appropriate policy environment, driven
by a strong foreign demand. It would however not have a significant impact on
overall sector growth in the short- to medium-term because of the relatively
small contribution of these crops to the current agricultural GDP, and export



12
earnings implies that continued good performance from these two crops will be
vital for Cate d'Ivoire's future economic growth.
35.     Comparative Advantage.  Table 4 below gives estimates of the country's
comparative advantage for the production of various crops, based on prices
expected in the medium-term (1995).

DI/     The Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) represents the value of domestic resources used per unit
of foreign exchange earned or saved. A DRC sm ller than unity Indicates that the country
can earn or save foreign exchange through local production. The computations are based
on a Shadow Exchange Rate (SER) equal to 1. 5 of the Official Exchange Rate (GER), and an
opportunity cost of land set at 0. A hibger SER/OER, reflecting a more overvalued exchange
rate, would improve DRC.
36. COte d'Ivoire will continue to enjoy a clear comparative advantage in the
production of cocoa and coffee as well as for diversification crops (rubber and
to a lesser extent oil palm and cotton). For cocoa, however, because of COte
d'Ivo!re's share of the total world production (35Z), it is estimated that the
marginal DRC is currently much higher than its average DRC (0.9 instead of 0.6).
A further increase in the country's share of the world's total cocoa output would
increase cocoa's marginal DRC even higher and further reduce the economic
benefits from incremental production, making other crops, coffee and rubber in
particular, more attractive alternatives for the use of the country's domestic
resources.   The DRCs for cotton and palm oil at projected 1995 international
prices are significantly below unity, even at today's relatively low productivity
levels. CMte d'Ivoire's farming is still for the most part at a very basic level
of technology and actual yields are much below their potential.   There is,
therefore, ample scope to increase factor productivity (and improved DRCs)
through the adoption of simple changes in cultural practices and increased use
of modern inputs, in particular improved seeds.

37.   COte d'Ivoire's comparative advantage for rice and maize is marginal at
current productivity levels. However, there are strong complemeutarities between
food and cash crops at farm level (both technical and social). In addition, as
in the case of cash crops, substantial scope exists for higher economic
efficiency in the production of these crops through the adoption of readily
available improved technologies. Finally, the legitimate objective of ensuring
an adequate level of food security and the large contribution of food crops to
the agricultural GDP dictate a balanced approach to agricultural development.
38.   Comparative advantage is an economic concept, and DRCs are computed using
prices adjusted to their real economic values and assuming no tariff protection.
If recomputed at unadjusted local prices using the official exchange rate and
assuming no tariff protection, only cocoa, coffee and rubber are viable, though
only marginally.   For all other crops, costs of production exceed value of
produetion. The difference between the economic value and the financial value
of production reflects the negative impact of the overvalued exchange rate on
the financial viability of agriculture. The exchange rate must be adjusted in
real terms if agricultural growth is to be sustained at 4S p.a. in the medium-
and long-term. Given the fixity of the nominal exchange rate, real devaluation
must come about through a reduction in local prices and salaries relative to
world prices.
C. Institutional Environment
39.   Development Agencies. Government policies are implemented through various
Development Agencies (SODEs) which provide farmers with extension services,
distribute inputs and sometimes handle the processing and marketing of the crop.
There are three main regional SODEs: the Cotton Development Agency (CIDT) handles
cotton and food crop development in the savanna region; the Company for
Modernization of Ivorian Agriculture (SATMACI) is responsible for coffee, cocoa
and food crop development in the forest region; and the Food Crop Development
Agency (CIDV) currently deals with food crop development in the coastal region.
other development agencies are responsible for specific crops: Palmindustrie for
oil palm and coconut; the African Rubber Company (SAPH) and the Rubber Company
of Grand Bereby (SOGB) for rubber; the Livestock Development Agency (SODEPRA);
and  the Fruit  and Vegetables  Development  Company  (SODEFEL).    In  1978,
Government's concern with improving the integration of the various food and cash
crops at farm level resulted in the restructuring of the three main agencies
(CIDT, SATMACI and SODEPALM) to give them both crop-specific and regional
development responsibilities. Recently, the extension services of CIDT, SATMACI
and CIDV were reorganized along the lines of the Training and Visit (T&V) system
under a Bank-financed project.   This has increased extension efficiency and
strengthened the agencies' farming system approach. This improvement would be
continued under a follow-up Agricultural Services Project, currently under
preparation.
40.   Agricultural Research is handled by several research institutes: the
'forest" institutes work on industrial and export crops grown in the forest
area; the others, grouped under the Savanna Research Institute (IDESSA), deal
with cotton, livestock and food crops. Research in agricultural technology is



14
handled by the Ivorian Technological Research Center (CIRT) and the Ivorian
Tropical Technology Institute. Ivorimn agricultural research has been excellent
and in some cases outstanding, in particular for cash crops. However, it has
also important shortcomingss (a) food crop research has so far concentrated
mainly on rice and maize -- until 1980, there was no meaningful program on
starchy staples; (b) a strong crop-specific orientation has not permitted
research on essential issues such as intercrop linkage or economic and financial
viability of technology packages; and tc) the relationship between research
institutes and extension agencies has been inadequate. Linkage between research
institutes and extension services is being strengthened under the Bank-financed
Agricultural Extension Project.   The research component of the Agricultural
Services Project under preparation would address all other outstanding issues
in Ivorian research, particularly the need to strengthen programming and
financing mechanisms, and improve training programs for Ivorian researchers.
41.   Input Distribution.  The main supplier of fertilizer is the semi-public
Ivorian Fertilizer Company (SIVENG) which imports fertilizer nutrients and
produces complex fertilizers for sale on the domestic market and for exports to
neighboring countries.   The private  sector is also a major importer of
fertilizer. Agricultural chemicals are freely imported by a number of large
international chemical companies and sold through a network of private traders.
It is estimated that about 90? of total consuwmption of fertilizer and
agrochemicals goes to cotton, sugar cane, pineapples, bananas and oil palm.
Cotton production alone accounts for more than half of total fertilizer
consumption. The very large areas under coffee and cocoa (2.5 million ha) are
currently practically not fertilized. Of the food crops, only irrigated rice
currently receives fertilizer (less than 1,000 tons per year).   Inputs are
distributed by the various development agencies and by private traders. The
role of the latter is growing rapidly and is encouraged by the Government.
Several large chemical firms are also setting up their own outlets for direct
sales to farmers. In 1985, SATMACI initiated a scheme (Oddp6t-vente*) through
which its rural stores can be used by private chemical distributors. The system
vorks well and is being generalized. CIDT is gradually divesting itself from
its input supply activities in favor of farmers' cooperatives.
42.   Credit.  Agricultural credit is mainly the responsibility of the National
Agricultural Development Bank (BNDA). Commercial banks have not provided any
meaningful amount of agricultural credit, mostly because of the substantial risks
involved. A network of rural credit cooperatives (CREPs) was established in the
mid-1970s, but most of them are financially and technically bankrupt for lack
of proper assistance and supervision. There also exists an autonomous credit
scheme to finance the development of the oil palm subsector. Credit available
to the agricultural sector from all institutional sources has been inadequate.
It is estimated that, between 1975 and 1985, only about 4? of all bank credit
was in favor of agriculture,  of which 70? from BNDA alone.   BNDA's own
performance has been poor. In 1985, with bad and doubtful loans amounting to
more than 40? of its portfolio, it went into quasi-bankruptcy. The Government
has decided to carry out BNDA's financial and operational rehabilitation and to
improve its role in the financing of the sector (para 74).
43.   Farmers' Cooperatives.  The establishment of a strong farmer cooperative
movement is one of the Government's stated objectives. The Government's strategy



15
has been to encourage the creation of pre-cooperative groups (GVCs) around the
sarketing of export crops (coffee, cocoa, cotton) by offering a small premium
for the products they market. The strategy has been relatively successful: in
1988, 2,400 GVCs marketed about 202 of the coffee and cocoa crop; and 290 GVCs
responsible for the marketing of 852 of the seed-cotton crop. The Development
Agencies are using GVCs to spread the impact of their services: extension staff
look for interested farmers primarily among GVC members; input supply is
organized around GVCs and so is most of BNDA's credit delivery. However, the
Ivorian cooperative movement is still in its infancy. Farmers join GVCs mainly
to secure the available marketing premia. Collective credit liability has by
and large failed, and the recovery of loans to GVCs' members is very low.
Besides an already well-established role in crop marketing, efforts should now
be made to gradually develop activities and services offered to members by GVCs,
in particular for the supply of inputs and raw matevial processing.   The
develoment of the Ivorian cooperative movement -- GVCs and CREPs -- will require
stronger commitment and support from the Government.
PART IV. THE MEDIUM-TERM AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM
(1989-94)
A. The Need for Adjustment
44.   Over the last two decades, the agricultural sector has been the economy's
main engine of growth. This performance resulted from a combination of favorable
circumstances: abundant land; high immigration of productive labor from
neighboring countries; favorable international prices for the country's main
export crops; and a stable political environment. However, the recession of the
early 19808 uncovered distortions which, although unheeded during the years of
economic growth, impaired the sector's ability to adjust to changing internal
and external circumstances: (a) a substantial agricultural taxation kept rural
incomes too low to finance widespread tecbnological change; (b) inadequate
pricing policies introduced increasing distortions between financial incentives
to farmers and the comparative advantage of various crops; (c) the ability of
parastatals to manage large development programs showed increasing signs of
strain; and (d) the Government's land-use policy was inadequate to rationally
manage the country's forest resources, protect fragile soils, and ensure that
young rural adults had adequate access to land.
45.   Between 1980 and 1986, these rigidities in the institutional and policy
environment of Ivorian agriculture combined with adverse external developments
to bring about a sharp reversal in the growth of real value added in the sector:
after increasing by 3.82 p.a. on average between 1965 and 1980, real agricultural
GDP declined by 1.52 p.a. over the 1980-87 period, as shown in Table 5 below.



16
Table 5: Average Growth in Real Agricultural Value Added a/

a/ At market prices.
This deterioration was the result of a combination of factors: the rate of
increase in rural population fell to 2.8? p.a. against 3.5Z p.a. between 1965
and 1980; the rate of expansion of cropped land declined to 2.9X p.a. (against
5.OZ); real producer prices declined by 0.52 p.a. on average; world prices for
most Ivorian agricultural exports fell even more rapidly (from 4? to 112 p.a.
depending on the crop); and the real exchange rate appreciated by more than 5?
p.a., reducing the profitability of export crops and that of crops competing
with cheap imports.
46.   Urgent action is necessary to reverse the above trends and stimulate
agricultural growth. Indeed, the country's future economic growth can only be
based on a buoyant rural economy supported by a dynamic peasantry. With the
rapid depletion of its known petroleum reserves, the country's only mineral
resource, C8te d'lvoire's main growth potential remains the efficient use of its
considerable agricultural ressources and the development of industries and
services both to supply agriculture and to process agricultural raw materials
for the domestic and export markets. With a medium- to long-term population
growth projected at 3.5? p.a., agricultural production will need to grow at more
than 4? p.a. to meet the country's domestic demand for food and sustain a growirLg
flow of agricultural exports.
47.   A healthy rural economy will also be required to slow down rural-urban
migration to a level compatible with the ability of the urban sector to absorb
labor. Over the last two decades, the urban population has increased by about
8S p.a. on average against about 2.5? for the rural population.   The urban
population increased from 32? of total population in 1975 to about 45? in 1985.
This migration supported the growth in the urban economy, but also put an
increasing strain on the Government's ability to provide basic services to an
exploding urban population.   The problem will worsen as the Government's
resources become severely limited and the projected sluggish economic growth
restricts employment creation in urban areas.  Between 1988 and 1995, labor
supply is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.4? p.a., but employment
opportunities at less than 4X p.a. Supply will far exceed demand for middle and
lower level white collar occupations. It is only for semi-skilled and unskilled



17
manual occupations that supply is likely to be short of demand and most of this
demand will be in rural areas. Already, due to the economic recession, urban
salaried employment has fallen by one third since the beginning of the 1980s,
and close to 20X of the active labor force in Abidjan is unemployed.
48.   On the other hand, rural-urban migration has gradually induced an increase
in the average age of the rural population (between 1965 and 1980, the annual
growth rate of the "male 15-29' age group was less than 22 in rural areas
compared with about 112 in urban areas). The age structure of farm heads reveals
a major structural problem as shown in Table 6 below.

Migration to urban areas, coupled with an increase in life expectancy and the
very limited access of young adults to land, resulted in a farm ownership
structure close to that of developed countries. Very few (92) farm heads are
under 35 years of age and a large proportion (402) is over 55 years old. Rural-
urban migration has deprived the rural economy of its better educated and more
dynamic labor force. The Government has been increasingly concerned with the
economic. social and political impact of the country's rapid rural-urban
migration.  In urban areas, an increasing population combined with diminishing
employment opportunities could lead to an explosive situatioa, while the
substantial potential for growth in rural areas would remain untapped because
of a shortage in human resources.
49.    Agricultural growth will increasingly require sustained productivity
gains to overcome emerging land and labor constraints.   In the short-term,
substantial productivity increases can be achieved by the efficient extension
of relatively simple, low-input technical improvements. However, in the medium-
to long-term, sustained productivity gains will require the adoption by farmers
of a steady flow of increasingly sophisticated technologies. The fundamental
condition of such sustained agricultural growth is the emergence of a class of
farmers who are younger, better educated and more open to progress. This, in
turn, requires decisive reforms on several fronts, such ass
(a) increasing rural incomes by reversing the domestic terms of trade
in favor of agriculture through appropriate macroeconomic policies,
to increase rural savings and farmers' capacity to finance inputs
and on-farm investments;



18
(b) improving farmers' access to modern inputs and to markets for their
produce by developing the transportation network and decreasing the
distribution/marketing costs through increased reliance on private
competitive operators, streamlining of parastatals, and the
elimination of costly administrative bottlenecks and controls;
(c) increasing farmers' access to basic agricultural services through
the improvement of agricultural extension agencies and of financial
intermediation in rural areas; and
(d) improving rural living conditions through the development of rural
infrastructure (roads, markets, electrification) and social services
(education, health, entertainment).
Finally, sustained agricultural growth in the long-term requires immediate action
for protecting the country's rural environment and productive base. Priority
areas include the protection and better management of natural forests, efficient
land-use planning, and improvements in farmers' access to land and land tenure
security, particularly for rural youth.
Domestic Terms of Trade and Rural Incomes
50.    In the past, the Government's policy has sought to reconcile several
objectives. It aimed at promoting the rapid development of the non-agricultural
sectors by transferring income from agriculture, while maintaining sufficiently
attractive incentives to farmers for generating the necessary growth in
agricultural production. Within the agricultural sector itself, the Government
sought to promote crops with the highest comparative advantage while encouraging
diversification and protecting crops considered strategic for food security
reasons (rice, oil palm) or for supporting rural incomes in poor areas (cotton
in the savanna).
51.    To achieve these objectives, the Government relied on a mix of trade,
fiscal and producer pricing policies which consistently turned the domestic
terms of trade against agriculture.   High tariffs and quantitative import
restrictions have provided the non-agricultural sectors with substantial levels
of protection while increasing farming costs. Export duties on agricultural
products have been one of the Government's main sources of fiscal revenues.
These duties have also allowed domestic manufacturers to purchase raw material
at prices significantly below world market prices.  However, they have also
depressed farm prices and rural incomes. Because of the high protection given
to the domestic industry, the exchange rate has consistently underestimated the
real cost of foreign exchange to the economy. This, in turn, further penalized
Ivorian exports, which are predominantly agricultural, and domestic food
production, including livestock.   The Government also relied on a tightly
administered agricultural producer pricing system by (a) setting the producer
prices of the major export crops (coffee, cocoa, oil palm, cotton) and of paddy;
and (b) fixing the consumer prices of strategic food stuff (rice, wheat flour,
sugar).   Over time,  administratively set prices have become increasingly
subjected to political and financial constraints and have shown an increasing
bias toward agricultural taxation.



19
52.    Faulty producer price policies, combined with adverse trade and exchange
rate policies, resulted in depressed rural incomes and a decline in agricultural
growth which slowed down markedly in the late 19709 and even turned negative in
the early 1980s. The size of the net transfers from agriculture to the other
sectors of the economy is difficult to measure and to evaluate. However, the
high level of protection given to non-agricultural sectors has required a heavy
burden of subsidy from agriculture. This subsidy, while reducing agricultural
incomes, has often been used not to increase capital formation and growth in non-
agricultural sectors, but to finance the inefficient use of resources by these
sectors, including the Government.
53.    In 1981, the Governmer.t embarked on a gradual reform of its agricultural
incentive system. Between 1981 and 1984, the producer prices of major export
crops were increased by 25? to 35? (in current terms), bringing them closer to
world prices. The trade liberalization reforms initiated by the Government in
the industrial sector under the Second Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL II) were
extended to selected crops under SAL III: the producer price of rubber is now
directly linked to world market prices, and domestic producers benefit from a
201 effective protection through appropriate levels of nominal tariffs and export
subsidies. Export taxes on other agricultural exports have been eliminated,
except for coffee, cocoa and timber exports. However, these reforms are still
fragmentary. Further steps are necessary to restore the internal terms of trade
in favor of agriculture. In particular, the Government needs to (a) move toward
a harmonized level of effective protection within the agricultural sector and
between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors; and (b) liberalize the
domestic agricultural price system through a gradual phasing out of controlled
prices, to pass on market signals, risks and returns to private economic
operators.
Agricultural Growth and Industrialization
54.    During the 19709, the strong performance of the agricultural sector
supported the development of a sizeable agro-industrial sector. In 1985, agro-
industries (including wood processing) accounted for about 55? of the total
value added in the Ivorian industrial sector (i.e., almost 15? of the country's
GDP). Domestic agro-industrial development was based on (a) the availability
of domestically produced raw material at prices often depressed by government
price and tax policies; (b) tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers which offered
a very high effective protection to agro-industries producing for the domestic
market (from 25? to more than 350? in 1980); and (c) a transport and service
infrastructure (banking in particular) excellent by African standards. In the
1960s and 1970s, agro-industrial development was largely been based on a fast
growing domestic demand fueled by a rapidly growing population and increasing
per caloita incomes. For export agro-industries (cotton, cocoa, wood processing),
favorable international prices and the high comparative advantage of C6te
d'Ivoire for the production of primary products resulted in competitive
industries despite high production factor prices and an adverse fiscal
environment. However, since the early 19809, the economic downturn and the
reduction in per capita income have depressed domestic demand. The value added
in the agro-industrial sector declined by nearly 30? between 1980 and 1984.



20
55.    With the projected slow growth in per capita income, growth in the
Ivorian agro-industrial sector will depend more and more on its competitiveness
on external markets.  This will require sustained productivSty improvements.
A recent study indicates that the average taxation on industrial goods
manufactured in COte d'Ivoire amounts to about 401 of the net-of-tax costs of
production. Import duties are high. Among domestic taxes, the value added tax
(VAT) paid on intermediate inputs often cannot be recovered by industrial
operators because their product is not itself subjected to VAT. This additional
production cost (estimated at 5 to 102 for agro-industrial products) can be
passed on to domestic consumers, but greatly diminishes the competitiveness of
Ivorian exports. Also, the cost of energy to industrial users is among the
higher in the world: fuel and electricity costs are twice as high as in developed
countries, in developing countries in Asia, and in the Western Africa sub-region.
Energy costs incorporate a large amount of taxes which cannot be recouped by
users, even when the output is exported, as they would if part or all of this
taxation was effected through a value added tax. In the same fashion, transport
services incorporate a large element of non-deductible taxation through duties
and VAT on imported equipment and spare parts, as well as through the taxation
of fuel.
56.    The sustained competitiveness of Ivorian agro-industries both on domestic
and external markets requires that immediate attention be given to measures for
alleviating the harmful impact of current fiscal and labor policies on the cost
of inputs. The Government has recently set up a high level working group to
study the reforms necessary for improving the competitiveness of the Ivorian
industrial sector.   This is a positive step.   However, meaeures already
identified as clearly beneficial should be introduced immediately. They include
the extension of VAT to all industrial products (and to agricultural products,
such as pineapples and bananas which use large amounts of modern inputs).
Domestic Resource Mobilization
57.    The policy reforms introduced under the structural adjustment process
aim at increasing private savings and investment while reducing public
consumption.   These actions require radical improvement of the financial
intermediation system, particularly in rural areas. At present, farmers' access
to institutional savings and credit facilities is very restricted. The formal
banking system has not catered to the needs of rural areas because of the high
cost of rural savi-gs mobilization and the excessive risk of agricultural
lending. Rural credit needs are mostly met on informal markets. With land-
extensive development gradually reaching its limit in the forest zone, and
savanna development increasingly constrained by labor shortages, agricultural
technology has to change with capital substituting for land and labor. This
implies an increased use of modern inputs and substantial on-farm investments
which informal credit markets are not able to finance. It is therefore urgent
to improve farmers' access to institutional sources of credit by (a) reducing
the risk of lending to agriculture to bankable levels through increased repayment
discipline and by providing credit guarantees to commercial banking institutions;
and (b) developing low-cost intermediation systems through better linkage between
the formal banking system and cooperative credit institutions.



21
58.    Since the beginning of the structural adjustment process, one of the
cornerstones of the Government's economic growth strategy has been the reduction
of the public sector's claim on donmestic resources and an expansion of private
savings and investments. To this end, the Government has taken a series of steps
to reduce public expenditures and pursued a policy of positive interest rates.
Despite these efforts, private savings and investments declined dramatically over
the 1981-86 period and tax effort remained high at about 232 of GDP on average
(up to 282 when favorable world prices generated large coffee and cocoa
stabilization revenues). Continued reliance on widely fluctuating agricultural
export taxes and stabilization margins translated into a structural fragility
in the public finance situation and a dependence on foreign borrowing to finance
large and unexpected swings in fiscal deficits. It is therefore necessary to
continue the reform of the country's fiscal system, away from an excessive
reliance on agricultural taxation, and in favor of a fiscal base more stable and
more neutral in its allocative effects.
59.    To make agriculture more competitive in the face of an overvalued
exchange rate (which reduces the value of exports and imports), domestic
production costs must be reduced.  This can be done by reducing taxation on
productive inputs (fuel, electricity, transport). Wages need to come down, and
this can be stimulated by reductions in government salaries and reduction in the
minimum wage. Agricultural price distortions craated by government policy need
to be reduced through either prices free to move in response to foreign and
domestic supply and demand, or changed by the Government in response to these
forces. The use of export taxes should be reduced, except for products for which
COte d'Ivoire is a price-maker on world markets (essentially cocoa).   Non-
traditional exports should be subsidized to offset the impact of the overvalued
exchange rate. A reduction in agricultural taxation will promote growth and
therefore generate additional fiscal revenues in the medium-term. In the short-
term, however, this will induce a drop in fiscal receipts and subsidies will
increase expenditures. To offset this requires stringent selectivity in public
expenditures and immediate implementation of measures to increase revenues from
existing taxes. Substantial scope already exists to do so by the elimination
of income and customs tax exemptions, the reduction of fraud at customs, and the
improvement of income, profit and real estate tax collection. Also, steps should
be taken to set the stage for the introduction of land taxation. The increase
in import duties by 10X, including on the import of many agricultural products,
will both generate revenue and help protect import substituting agriculture from
the effects of the overvalued exchange rate.   These draconian measures are
required in the absence of an exchange rate parity change, to render agriculture
profitable.
Role of the Public Sector
60.    In the 1960s and 1970s, the Government ploughed back part of its windfall
earnings from agricultural taxation into crop-specific parastatals in charge of
the development of new crops (sugar, rubber, palm oil and cotton). This strategy
met with mixed results. While the parastatals were relatively successful in
introducing new crops over significant areas, their tight control over
development patterns stifled farmers' initiative and did not permit as rapid a
crop expansion as was possible.   Overextended and bureaucratic parastatal



22
management has been slow to recognize changes in the domestic and world
environment and to make the necessary policy adjustments. The inefficiencies
and high cost of services of parastatals protected from market forces have
imposed an additional taxation of farmers, thereby effectively hampering the
development  of the very  commnilties  they meant  to promote.    Also,  the
Government's excessive control ot productive activities has shielded economic
agents from market forces and risks. Administratively set producer prices and
"cost-plus" operating margins for processing and marketing operators (CIDT for
cotton ginning, Palmindustrie for palm oil, private agents for coffee and cocoa
marketing and rice milling) have taken away incentives to adjust to changing
circumstances and stifled the spirit of enterprise necessary for a dynamic
economy.
Management of Natural Resources
61.    The Government has been slow in providing a regulatory framework to
manage natural resources efficiently. In the savanna, widespread land clearing
and mechanization have had harmful effects on shallow soils and should in the
future be systematically accompanied by soil conservation measures.   In the
forest zone, the tropical rain forest is being cut at a rate of more than 200,000
ha per annum.  At the beginning of the century, there were about 14.0 million
ha of rain forest in C6te d'Ivoire.  In 1960, 12.0 million still remained.
Today, only about 3.0 million ha are left. The remainder is composed of about
3.0 million ha of tree crops, 1.0 million ha of food crops and about 7.0 million
ha of fallow land and secondary forests. If present trends continue, most of
the remaining forest will have disappeared by the year 2000.   Under that
scenario, timber production, which up to the early 19809 amounted to 4.0 million
m3/p.a., would decline to less than 500,000 m3 per annum.  This implies the
disappearance of more than 15,000 jobs in the forestry/wood processing sector
and a loss of some US$400.0 million in annual foreign exchange earnings, which
would run counter to the Government's diversification objectives.   Of even
greater concern, however, are the potential ecological consequences of continued
deforestation.   The opening-up of the forest canopy will have far reaching
consequences for the forest region soils and ecological balances and will affect
the country's agricultural and overall economic development. Forceful measures
are needed to protect and better manage the country's forest resources.
62.    The protection of natural forests will also require a quick shift from
traditional extensive agriculture toward more intensive cultivation methods.
Important efforts need to be made to develop stable farming systems, including
the gradual integration of livestock and agriculture, diversification tnto new
crops, and protection of soil fertility. Efficient agricultural research and
extension services are necessary. Farmers will need access to modern inputs
and the means to finance them.   However, the fundamental determinants of
agricultural intensification will be the pressure caused by the increased
scarcity of land and the improved education of younger farmers increasingly
provided with  adequate  land  tenure  security.    With  reduced  employment
possibilities in urban areas, young rural adults are voicing an increasingly
insistent demand for extracting land from its traditional collective management.
The Government should assist in this gradual transition to a modern land tenure
system.



23
Education and Health
63.    Since independence, education has been one of the Government's high
priorities. From insignificant enrollments in 1960, approximately 602 of the
school age population attends primary school today (a growth rate of 7.22 p.a.
over the 1960-82 period). This was achieved through extraordinary efforts in
favor of the education sector (the share of education in government recurrent
budget averaged 422 in the 1981-85 period). However, the hierarchical nature
of the education system and its curriculum ill-suited to the realities of the
country may well have been two of the most powerful causes for the alienation
of rural children from their environment, therefore contributing to the rural-
urban migration. Agricultural education in itself is restricted to specialized
schools which cater only to the needs of government services.   The poor
curriculum of these schools and the job security enjoyed by the graduates as
lifetime civil servants have been detrimental to their attitude and performance.
64.    Improvement in health has been more modest, although COte d'Ivoire has
made substantial economic progress in the past 25 years.  Important regional
disparities in health reflect marked differences in access to health services.
Life expectancy ranges from 56 years in Abidjan to 39 years in the rural savanna
region. Infant mortality is likewise much lower in Abidjan than in rural areas.
Deaths of children under the age of five account for about half of all deaths
in the country, primarily resulting from unsanitary conditions and poor maternal
health (in rural areas, only 10X of all births takes place in a sanitary
environment). Sustained productivity gains will not be possible without improved
population access to basic health and education services.
65.    An in-depth reform of COte d'Ivoire's education and health systems is
essential to make them more responsive to the country's real needs and more
effective for its future economic development. The Government is revising its
strategy in the health and education sectors.  In education, it will pursue
efforts at cost reduction and efficiency improvements for meeting fast expanding
educational needs within constrained budgetary resources. Priorities will be
given to (a) expanding the access of populations to a primary education better
suited to their environment and needs; and (b) improving vocational training
(particularly in agriculture) and the quality and relevance of higher education
levels to better match the skill mix requirements of the economy. The Government
intervention in the health sector will aim at reversing the current bias toward
urban areas and curative care, in favor of (i) improved access to basic health
services in rural areas; and (ii) increased preventive care efforts, particularly
in maternal and child care.
B. The Agricultural Sector Adiustment Program 1989-90
1.    Rationale and Obiectives
66.    The Structural Adjustment process in Cate d'Ivoire, launched In 1981 to
make the economy more efficient and more responsive to changes in the internal
and external environment, is still unfinished. It will be a long process because
it involves, beside economic reforms, changes in institutions and attitudes.
It must confront the continuing deterioration of the country's terms of trade



24
and the legacy of a large foreign debt. The challenge is greatest in agriculture
where policies to increase rural incomes and encourage the efficient allocation
of available resources are critical for the resumption of economic growth. The
agricultural adjustment program seeks to deepen the progress achieved in
agriculture under the first three SALs vhile continuing the structural policy
reforms.
67.    The structural adjustment program in agriculture which would be supported
by the proposed Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) is presented in the
Government's Statement of Agricultural Policy  (Appendix 1).   Goverrament's
objective is to reach a sustainable rate of growth in the agricultural sector
of at least 42 per annum by the mid-1990s.   Its strategy is based on a
comprehensive package of economic and institutional reforms as follows:
(a) at the macro-economic and sectoral levels, the Government will
pursue ongoing reforms in the areas of fiscal policies, financial
intermediation, trade and price liberalization, and public
expenditure rationalization. Also, the Government will introduce
major reforms to improve the management of the country's natural
resource base;
(b) at the institutional level, more transparency will be introduced
in agricultural parastatal operations and accounts. Measures will
also be taken to increase the efficiency of parastatals providing
essential support services to fariers, by streamlining activities,
improving management, transferring commercial activities to the
private or cooperative sectors, and increasing the exposure of
parastatals to market forces; and
(c) at the micro level, the Government will prepare and implement
specific investments and programs in priority areas to support the
proposed economic and institutional reforms and translate them into
concrete operations and outputs.
The paragraphs below present the specific measures and actions which will be
undertaken during the first two years 1989-90 of the Government's medium-term
agricultural adjustment program. The most critical of these measures will be
conditions of Tranche Release of the proposed ASAL. They are presented in Table
7 (page 97) ar.d in Annex IV (along with associated measures/actions which would
be undertaken under the ASAL -- Annex V).
2. Specific Measures Under the Agricultural Adjustment Program
(a) Mobilization and Allocation of Domestic Resources
68.    Fiscal Reforms.  A major challenge facing the Government is to develop
a taxation system based on consumption rather than production. In this respect,
the extension of the VAT to all sectors of economic activity will be actively
pursued under the Government's ongoing economic reform program.   The major
benefits of this measure will be (a) less discrimination against domestic
producers, as they will be subjected to the same VAT rate as importers and,
therefore, able to recover VAT paid on inputs; and (b) better competitiveness



25
of Ivorian exports, since VAT on inputs will also be reimbursed to domestic
producers. Subjecting both agro-industries producing for domestic consumption
and competing imports to the normal VAT rate will generate additional fiscal
revenues. However, it will also increase the consumer price of food, which may
not be socially desirable. In a first phase, the VAT rate applied should not
be so high as to significantly increase the price of essential food products.
The extension of the VAT to agro-industries will be used, in a first stage, more
as a means to reduce distortions than as a source of additional fiscal revenues.
69.    Under the ASAL, the VAT will be extended to major agricultural and agro-
industrial products. To limit the negative impact of the introduction of VAT
on the price of essential consumer goods, the concerned products will initially
be subjected to a 52 (reduced) rate. This will have only a small impact either
on government revenues or on consumer price, as VAT on finished goods would be
about equal to VAT paid on inputs.
70.    Public Expenditure Program.   COte d'Ivoire's future growth and debt
repayment capacity require that productive investments be sustained in spite of
the country's current difficult financial situation.   Although productive
investments would mostly be based on private initiative, public expenditures will
also play in the medium-term a critical role in promoting rural economic growth
and ensuring basic services.   Particular attention should be given to the
improvement of agricultural services and of the rural road network (to improve
the import/export capacity of rural areas and increase the competitiveness of
rural-based  production).    Also,  the  Government  should  restructure  its
expenditures in the social sectors away from high-cost services for urban elites
toward the provision of low-cost basic social services for the poor, both in
urban and rural areas. The Government is developing a core medium-term program
of activities in favot nf rural areas. This program will provide the sliding
basis for the preparation of annual public expenditure programs.
71.    The ASAL will provide the mechanism to monitor the Government's annual
recurrent and investment budgets. In the context of the 1990 and 1991 Public
Expenditure Reviews, agreement will be sought on the scope and content of the
Government's medium-term core program of public expenditures in favor of rural
areas. Specific attention will be given to (a) budgetary allocations for the
financing of agricultural export premia and the operating budgets of extension
and research agencies; and (b) the level and nature of public recurrent and
investment expenditures for rural infrastructure and social services.
72.    Private Resource Mobilization.   With extensive cultivation methods
reaching their limits, the need for capital to substitute for land and labor
will make future agricultural modernization increasingly dependent on efficient
rural financial intermediation. At the end of 1985, in spite of a relatively
developed banking network, aboat 752 of total bank deposits originated from the
Abidjan area and less than 5Z of total bank lending was in favor of the
agricultural sector.   The National Bank for Agricultural Development (BNDA)
accounted for about 80% of total credit to agriculture. Cozmmuity-based credit
cooperatives (CREPs), promoted by the Government in the early 1970s to cater to
farmers production and consumption credit needs, are floundering because of lack
of management expertise and proper supervision. Most farmers either pay cash for
inputs or turn toward informal lenders.  The latter, however, are unable to



26
provide the larger, longer-term credit required for financing modern
agricultural inputs and investments, or for meeting the needs of small- and
medium-scale rural enterprises.
73.    BNDA's performance has been poor.   An audit commissioned by the
Government in 1986 revealed an organization overstaffed with inexperienced
personnel, with faulty procedures and grossly inadequate management systems.
The institution has been insolvent for more than two years, with bad debts
amounting to more than half its portfolio. The Government recently decided to
rehabilitate BNDA. A medium-term financial restructuring plan is being prepared.
Its first phase, dealing with losses accumulated by BNDA as of September 30,
1986, has recently been approved by Government. Out of total losses of CFAP 60.3
billion (US$193.0 million), CFAF 45.0 billion was eliminated through assumption
by the Government of part of 8NDA's liabilities, and tax relief. However, BNDA
has accumulated further operating losses during the last three fiscal years
(October 1, 1986 - September 30, 1989). It is estimated that a total of about
CFAF 28.0 billion in fresh money is currently needed to fully restore its equity.
This injection of funds will be carried out gradually during the implementation
of BNDA's medium-term rehabilitation program.
74.    The Government recently outlined the measures to be taken and the
policies to be followed by BNDA to improve its efficiency and ensure its
financial viability. The measures and policies to be implemented under the ASAL
and presented in a Letter submitted to the Bank are as follows.
(a) finalization and implementation of BNDA's medium-term financial
restructuring program;
(b) adoption of a Statement of Operational Policy clearly defining
BNDA's deposit mobilization and credit policies, measures to protect
depositors and BNDA's relationship with the Government, along the
following linest (i) BNDA would finance with its own funds and at
its own risk only those operations with manageable credit risks.
It would also extend credit for more risky enterprises, on behalf
of the Government and without incurring the risk, on resources
provided by the Government5 and (ii) BNDA would receive an adequate
remuneration for activities carried out at the Government's request;
(c) design and implementation of a medium-term action program permitting
BNDA to achieve satisfactory operational efficiency and ensure its
longer-term financial viability, including the overhaul of internal
procedures and information systems, as well as improved staffing and
staff training programs; and
(d) entering by BNDA into an agreement with a suitable banking
institution able to provide management assistance, through a full-
fledged partnership or a suitable twinning/management assistance
contract.



27
Finally, the Government would prepare and implement a pilot operation to
strengthen the role of cooperatives in rural financial intermediation, improve
the linkage between formal financial institutions and these cooperatives, and
increase BNDA's penetration of rural markets while decreasing its intermediation
costs.
(b) Price and Incentive Framework
75.    The objective of government policy should be to maximize the country's
welfare throughs (a) policies which permit prices at all levels of the marketing
chain to respond to domestic and foreign market conditions; (b) an optimal level
of taxation for cocoa and coffee, for which the country has international market
power; and (c) providing all other crops with a net effective protection of
unity. In the medium-term, the Government's price policy interventions should
therefore be limited to setting adequate tariff protection and taxation levels.
In the short-term, however, the Government's pricing policy will continue to
accommodate other objectives or constraints. A careful balance in the relative
incentives given to various crops is necessary to promote the desired
diversification of production. Tariff protection of some crops is also required
for the country to maintain an adequate level of food security in the face of
an overvalued exchange rate. Finally, some price intervention will be undertaken
to smooth out the negative developmental and social impacts of short-term price
swings on world markets and the impact of exchange rate overvaluation on export
crops. This is particularly the case for crops which either require a long-term
commitment of resources (tree crops) or represent farmers' only major source of
income (cotton in the savanna).
Cocoa and Coffee
76.    COte d'Ivoire enjoys a comparative advantage for cocoa and coffee
production which is high in absolute terms (average DRCs at 0.4) and relative
to other crops. For this reason, and because of the two crops' share in the
country's total agricultural GDP (40X) and export earnings (70Z), growth in the
cocoa and coffee subsector will continue to be key to the future growth of
agriculture and of the overall economy. The objective of the Government's cocoa
and coffee pricing policy is to (a) provide cocoa and coffee farmers with
relatively attractive, stable financial returns for promoting the sustained
development of both crops while preserving incentives for farmers to also grow
other crops; (b) optimize the contribution of cocoa and coffee to the economy
taking into account opportunities and constraints in world markets; and (c)
generate substantial fiscal revenues. To do so, the Government has mostly relied
on a system of tightly administered producer prices (which have been kept almost
constant in real terms and never decreased in nominal terms). The crop is bought
from farmers at the official price by private traders operating on behalf of the
Stabilization Fund (CSSPPA) and paid on a fixed scale basis. It is then sold
by CSSPPA on international markets. This policy has been successful in achieving
a rapid expansion of cocoa production while allowing C6te d'Ivoire to meet its
export quota under the International Coffee Agreement (ICA). However, it also
has major drawbacks.



28
77.    Historically, the taxation of cocoa and coffee farmers has been high:
during the 1970-86 period, they received about 60? of the farmgate border parity
price of cocoa and 502 of that of coffee.  Taxation of the two crops can be
justified by COte d'Ivoire's dominant position on world markets (cocoa) and
market rigidities introduced by international commodity agreements (coffee).
In the short-term, it vill remain an indispensable source of fiscal revenues.
However, this taxation needs to (a) be calibrated for promoting a better use of
available resources; and (b) take into account the need to maintain farm incomes
at minimum levels for sustaining improvements in rural living conditions as well
as widespread technological changes (a decrease of CFAF 10/kg in the producer
price of cocoa and coffee transfers about CFAF 8.0 billion -- US$26.0 million
-- from farmers to the Government).
78.    Since 1977, the Government has ignored the world price differential in
favor of coffee (about 25Z on average) and set the same guaranteed producer
price for both coffee and cocoa. At past and projected international prices,
parity represents a much heavier taxation of coffee than cocoa and introduces
distortions in the allocation of farmers' resources between the two crops. At
price parity, cocoa's relatively low technical and labor requirements provide
farmers with much higher financial returns than coffee. As a result, Ivorian
farmers have planted massive amounts of cocoa ovor the last two decades. The
cocoa orchard is young and total production is expected to exceed 900,000 tons
by the year 2000 if present trends continue. This increase, together with cocoa
expansion in other countries, will continue to induce a decline in the real price
of cocoa on world markets and will reduce marginal export revenues for Cote
d'Ivoire (currently, because of its dominant position on the international
markets, it is estimated that a 1Z increase in COte d'Ivoire's cocoa exports only
translates into a 0.62 increase in its export revenues). Further cocoa expansion
should, therefore, be slowed down and alternative crops, including coffee,
encouraged. However, because the two crops are close substitutes, parity between
cocoa and coffee producer prices has resulttd in a slowdown in new coffee
plantings, an aging coffee orchard and a gradual decline of its productive
capacity. If present trends continue, coffee production will decline from about
210,000 tons at present (300,000 t around 1980) to about 150,000 tons by the year
2000. The Government must urgently introduce forceful measures to boost coffee
plantings and productivity.
79.    Finally, the contribution of coffee and cocoa to the economy could also
be increased by measures to improve produce quality and the efficiency of current
marketing arrangements.   The Government has so far refused to link producer
prices to produce quality, relying instead upon quality controls by CSSPPA
agents. These controls are totally ineffective. As a result, farmers no longer
harvest their crops to achieve satisfactory quality standards. About 202 of the
cocoa crop is currently of substandard quality and, following the introduction
of industrial coffee hulling in the early 1980s, the proportion of non-marketable
'black beans" has increased from 5Z to 25? of total coffee production. With
world markets experiencing a structural oversupply, low quality products will
increasingly sell at steep discounts. It is therefore essential that immediate
measures be taken to tackle the quality problem.



29
80.    Faced with the recent collapse in cocoa and coffee prices (both fetched
a c.i.f. price of about US$l,400/t during August 1989) and the projected slow
recovery of these prices, the Government recently cut the cocoa producer price
from CFAF 400/kg to CFAF 250/kg for the end of the 1988-89 crop season (July to
September 1989), bringing it in line with world market prices. It also indicated
to the Bank its intention to (a) set the 1989-90 producer prices for both cocoa
and coffee at CFAF 2501kg; and (b) reduce the domestic marketing cost of the two
products, including the operating costs of CSSPPA. Alone, the reduction in
producer prices will represent a public savings of more than CFAP 160.0 billion
(US$510 million) over the next 18 months.  In the medium-term, however, the
Government's objective should be to free producer prices all together, fully
liberalize the marketing system, and introduce optimal export taxation of the
crops. In the short-term, the Government's program is less ambitious, aiming
to reduce the current discrimination against coffee production, make prodlucer
prices more responsive to market signals (in particular with regard to produce
quality), and improve the efficiency of the existing marketing system.
81.    Under the ASAL,  incentives  in favor of coffee production will be
introduced through a combination of quality premium at producer level and
targeted investment incentives. The quality premium will more than cover the
cost of activities (better harvesting and sorting) necessary to improve produce
quality. Since these activities are traditionally done by family labor (which
may not be otherwise fully employed), the quality premium will also have a
positive impact on rural incomes. It is estimated that the proposed quality
premium (CFAF 33/kg of dried beans) will have a neutral impact on public finance,
since the Government will no longer incur the cost of purchasing, transporting
and storing unsellable black beans (estimated to cost CFAP 3.5 billion for 10,000
tons). Incentives will also be provided to farmers for stumping and replanting
coffee stands, and increasing the productivity of coffee plantations. Specific
measu.es taken under the ASAL are:
(a) a coffee quality premium of CFAF 33/kg will be introduced at the
beginning   of   the   1989-90   season   (distributed   through
processing/marketing agents);
(b) the Government will implement a coffee rehabilitation program,
including replanting and stumping incentives, increased availability
of improved planting material, and improvements in extension
services; and
(c) the Government will undertake a comprehensive review of the present
pricing and marketing system, with a view to (i) introducing greater
flexibility in producer prices; (ii) streamlining CSSPPA's
involvement in domestic marketing/quality control to reduce the cost
of its operations; and (iii) passing on to marketing agents a
greater share of market risks and providing incentives for reducing
marketing costs.



30
Diversification Crops
82.    COte d'Ivoire has good potential for the economic production of a variety
of crops besides cocoa and coffee. In the forest zone, rubber and palm oil have
long been targeted by the Government for rapid expansion. In the savanna, cotton
production has been successfully developed and now represents the main source
of income for more than one third of savanna farmers. At current and projected
(1995) world prices, C8te d'Ivoire's main diversification crops show good
comparative advantage at all levels of technology (DRCs ranging from 0.4 for
rubber to 0.8 for cotton and oil palm). Their development should therefore be
encouraged. Also, the economic viability of the country's diversification crops
could be significantly increased by sustained productivity gains at the farm and
processing/marketing levels. The Government strategy to achieve these sustained
productivity gains and encourage the fast and efficient development of the main
diversification crops is to implement a gradual trade and pricing reform aimed
at providing the crops with a net effective protection of unity and making
domestic producers more responsive to market signals. Under SAL III, this reform
has been extended to rubber and oil palm as a first step. Implementation has
been satisfactory for rubber but not for oil palm. In addition, a large number
of agricultural products do not yet benefit from the incentive element of the
trade reform (export premia) while bearing the full cost of its tariff component.
Their development is therefore impaired by a strongly negative protection. The
Government should eliminate these distortions through the generalization of the
trade liberalization reform to the entire agricultural sector (except cocoa,
coffee and logs).
83.    Oil Palm. The Government has been reluctant to fully implement the trade
liberalization reform in the oil palm sector and let the producer price of oil
palm bunches  (FFB) move in line with world market developments.   It has
maintained a guaranteed price to small producers (CFAP 19/kg) which is much
higher than the border parity price at the official exchange rate (about
CFAF 13/kg). As a result, Palmindustrie (the parastatal responsible for the
development of the subsector) has an average production cost of about
CFAF 140,000/ton (CFAF 110,000/t for its own industrial plantations but about
CFAF 190,000/t for the smallholder sector) which is higher than the export price
of crude oil (CFAF 120,000/t including the export subsidy). Losses on crude oil
exports are covered by profits from sales to the domestic refining industry made
under an overall tariff protection of 10O (including a 80X surcharge). Ivorian
oil palm production is therefore heavily subsidized by domestic consumers. The
current arrangements have major drawbacks: (a) the high domestic price of
finished products (twice the border price) imposes a heavy taxation on consumers
for basic consumption goods; (b) the high guaranteed producer price provides
artificially inflated financial returns (CFAF 3,000 per manday against CFAP 1,200
for coffee and CFAF 2,000 for cocoa) which allow smallholders to profitably
establish plantations in areas ecologically ill-suited for oil palm production;
and (c) Palmindustrie, because it benefits from a captive domestic market, has
been very slow to improve management and to cut costs.
84.    Cotton.   The producer price of seed-cotton, like that of cocoa and
coffee, is stabilized by CSSPPA. CIDT's processing and developmental activities
are paid by CSSPPA according to negotiated standard costs ("bar&me") which



31
include the government-set producer price of seed-cotton. Any surplus between
the price guaranteed to CIDT for lint and the actual sales price accrues to
CSSPPA. Any deficit is paid back to CIDT by CSSPPA. Since 1985, the price paid
to farmers for seed-cotton has been fixed at CFAF 115/kg and the lint price
guaranteed to CIDT at about CFAF 600/kg. With the fall of prices on world
markets and the real appreciatioh of the CFAF, the border parity price of seed-
cotton (at the official exchange rats) has fallen well below the level guaranteed
to producers. As a result, CSSPPA has accumulated large deficits. For 1989.
in spite of a recovery in international prices and CIDT's efforts to improve
efficiency, CSSPPA's cotton deficit is still projected at about CFAF 20.0
billion. As in the case of coffee and cocoa, the Government's medium-term
objective should be to implement a full trade liberalization in the cotton
sector   This would permit better risk sharing among the sector's operators
(including CIDT), induce farmers to improve the quality of the crop, and promote
the diversification of agricultural production in a region heavily dominated by
cotton. Immediate implementation of such a reform, however, would induce (at
the official exchange rate) a steep fall in producer price and rural incomes in
the country's poorest region. This would have heavy social and political cost.
Immediate measures should, however, be taken to promote the quality of the
produce and reduce government cotton account deficit through a reduction in input
subsidies and improvements at all levels of CIDT's operations.
85.    Under the ASAL the following measures would be undertaken:
(a)  the trade liberalization reform will be generalized to the entire
agricultural sector (except cocoa, coffee and cotton) as of January
1, 1990. Export subsidies for pineapples will be introduced as part
of a comprehensive rehabilitation package for the sector, and those
for banana exports will be paid only for exports elsewhere than to
the protected French market;
(b)  the pricing reform in the oil palm sector will be pursued through
the total financial separation of Palmindutrie's own operations
from those it undertakes on behalf of the Government; a decrease
in the floor price guaranteed to smallholders from CFAF 19 to CFAF
14/kg (FFB); a decrease of the tariff surcharge on palm oil imports
from 80 to 402; and payment to farmers of the actual farmgate
border parity price with the floor price supported through a Price
Support Fund.   This fund will be financed by a levy paid by
producers (modelled on the Fund already operating in the rubber
sector) and, if necessary, through budgetary allocations; and
(c)  the responsibility for the marketing of cotton and cotton products
will be transferred from CSSPPA to CIDT; the subsidies on farm
inputs (insecticides) for cotton will be gradually eliminated; the
producer price differential between the different grades of seed-
cotton will be increased; and the Government will undertake a study
of a producer price support system which permits a greater
flexibility in producer prices and better sharing of risks among
sector operators.

Food Crops and Livestock
86.    The combined food crop and livestock production represents about 45? of
total agricultural GDP. Its promotion is an essential element of a balanced
sector growth strategy.   The prices of most traditional food crops (yams,
cassava, plantain) are freely determined by market forces. Hcwever, they are
also influenced by the prices of paddy, rice and wheat flour which are currently
controlled by the Government. Domestic production of paddy covers about two-
thirds of the country's total needs (600,000 tons of rice). Farm surpluses are
sold through official channels (about 107 of total production) or on the free
market, at prices ZO to 30? higher than the official price. Imports of rice
and wheat flour are carried out by licensed private operators and by a
parastatal, the Caisse de P4r6nuation. The official paddy producer price and
rice consumer price are on average about 302 higher than their border price
equivalent (at the official exchange rate). The substantial fiscal resources
from taxing rice impo-ts more than covered the subsidies paid to producers and
processors. In 1988, the Government launched a detailed study of the domestic
production and marketing of rice.   The study has been completed and its
recommendations ar being reviewed by the Government. It recommends that the
Government free the price and marketing of domestically produced, high quality
rice, while retaining control over the price of low quality (357 broken) imported
rice. Such an arrangement would (a) satisfy the Government's objective to ensure
food security for the country as a whole and for the poorer segments of the
population in particular; and (b) liberalize the market for domestically produced
rice and eliminate the need for government subsidies to domestic producers and
marketing agents.
87.    The Government recently decreased the official producer price of paddy
and eliminated the operating subsidies to industrial millers. These measures
will reduce the share of domestic paddy sold through official channels to
insignificant levels unless industrial millers offer farmers a much higher price
for their paddy than the official level. Under the ASAL, the Government will
prepare and implement a comprehensive policy reform package to liberalize the
pricing and marketing of domestically produced rice (while providing domestic
producers with an adequate effective protection) and improve the efficiency of
the Caisse de Perequation's operations.
88.    Domestic livestock production has been severely penalized by inadequate
protection vis-a-vis competing products imported at dumping prices.   The
resulting low consumer price of livestock products (beef in particular) has
encouraged domestic demand and has been a strong disincentive not only to Ivorian
producers but also to producers in the neighboring Sahelian countries. As a
result, COte d'Ivoire currently imports about 75X of its beef and more than 50X
of its mutton requirements. Under the ASAL, the Government will prepare and
implement a detailed medium-term program for the development of the livestock
sector.  It will take measures to provide domestic livestock producers with
adequate and effective protection, while not insulating them from market forces
(through satisfactory arrangements to protect domestic production against
subsidized imports such as a variable import tariff).

(c) Institutional Environment
89.    Parastatals.  Uneven use has been made of the recommendations of the
audits of the country's main agricultural parastatals commissioned by the
Government under SAL II. Palmindustrie (palm oil) strengthened its financial
management and introduced measures to reduce its operating costs. The financial
rehabilitation of CIDT (cotton, food crops) was carried out and a new arrangement
concluded with its foreign partner. The audit of SODESUCRE (sugar) led to a
rehabilitation program including the closing down of two non-viable mills.
SATMACI's (cocoa, coffee and food crops) and CIDV (food crops) extension services
have been reorganized along the lines of the T&V system, and their financial and
accounting management improved under a Bank-financed operation.   SODEFOR's
(forestry) and SODEPRA's (livestock) accounting systems have also been
strengthened. The audit of MOTORAGRI (rural works) has not so far led to any
follow-up action.   Although positive,  these measures have only marginally
improved the parastatals' internal procedures and operating efficiency. They
have not addressed several important issues: (a) the Government is still heavily
engaged in directly productive activities; (b) parastatals have retained their
monopoly position in crop marketing (CIDT, Palmindustrie); and (c) parastatals
are still insulated from market forces by very high levels of protection
(SODESUCRE, Palmindustrie) or reimbursed on a cost-plus basis for their services
(CIDT). Outright privatization of agricultural parastatals is difficult because
they usually undertake both commercial operations and public service activities
(extension) on behalf of the Government. A more feasible approach consists of
(i) a clear accounting and financial separation of their commercial and public
service activities; (ii) the divestiture of some of their commercial operations;
and (iii) the exposure to market forces of the commercial operations they retain.
90.    Under the ASAL, the following specific measures will be taken:
(a)  Palmindustrie's own agricultural and agro-industrial operations will
be financially separated from activities undertaken on behalf of the
Government. Palmindustrie's own objectives will be to diversify its
activities, improve competitiveness on domestic and international
markets, and provide an adequate return on its share capital.
Palmindustrie will prepare a medium-term development strategy for
the subsector based on a detailed analysis of the domestic and
regional markets for edible oils, and a development plan for its own
operations, to diversify its activities and decrease the cost of its
operations;
(b) CIDT will pursue its efficiency improvement program through the
streamlining of its extension activities, the divestiture of input
supply operations to the private and cooperative sectors, improved
staffing and staff training policies, and better management
information systems. CTDT will prepare a medium-term development
program that will include specific efficiency improvement targets
to be embodied into a 'Contrat-Plan' signed with the Government;



34
(c) an in-depth review of SATMACI and CIDV objectives, organization,
operational policies and staffing will be carried out (including a
managerial and technical skill gap analysis) and agreed upon
measures implemented to improve the cost effectiveness of their
extension services to farmers;
(d) a medium-term rehabilitation plan will be prepared for MOTORAGRI,
with the objective of making this agency an effective tool for
opening and maintaining feeder roads and developing bottomlands.
MOTORAGRI will adopt full cost accounting for its services and be
exposed to competition from private contractors when bidding for
public works;
(e) the Government will prepare and implement a medium-term development
program for the seed sector, with production being gradually
transferred to the private sector, and the parastatal responsible
for the development of improved seed production (OSP) only assuming
a coordinating and seed certification role.   This program will
include the gradual removal of subsidies on improved seeds and
planting material to permit the development of a viable commercial
sector; and
(f) SODEPRA will divest itself from its commercial meat packing
activities and SODEFEL from its tomato canning operations.
91.    Cooperative Sector.  The emergence of a dynamic cooperative sector has
always been one of the Government's stated objectives.  The establishment of
pre-cooperative groups (GVCs) around the marketing of export crops has been
encouraged by offering a small premium for crops marketed through GVCs. The
strategy has been relatively successful.   However, the Ivorian cooperative
movement is stagnating, mainly because of (a) a weak social cohesiveness at the
local level; (b) a lack of support from the Government to train GVC managers and
provide technical assistance; (c) GVC's very limited access to formal credit;
and (d) an excessive involvement of government officials in GVC management and
in the use of profits. Many of the tasks now performed by the State could be
successfully carried out by cooperatives.  This would relieve the burden on
public finance and promote farmers' involvement in activities upstream and
downstream of agricultural production.   The Government's Letter of Development
Policy (Appendix 1) contains its strategy for the development of the cooperative
sector. Within the context of the Agricultural Adjustment Program, a project
will be prepared and implemented to carry out the most critical elements of the
Government's strategy including (i) the provision of training and technical
assistance to GVCs; (ii) improved GVC access to formal credit sources; and (iii)
the development of GVCs' economic base through the expansion of their input
supply and downstream activities. The Government will allow increased management
autonomy of GVCs.
92.    Return of Youth to the Land.  The Government has begun to resettle young
Ivorians into agricultural activities. The idea is to provide young rural adults
with attractive living conditions and employment opportunities in agriculture
and in associated rural services. The structural adjustment process, designed



35
to redress the domestic terms of trade in favor of agriculture and improve living
conditions in rural areas will contribute to making the settlement of youth in
rural areas attractive. Also necessary for the success of this program is to
provide Ivorians youth with better access to land.   Under the ASAL,  the
Government will design and implement a pilot operation aimed at resettling rural
youth ir. productive activities in their communities. The operation will be based
on locally sponsored micro-projects involving (a) communal steering committees
with representation of the local elite; (b) careful selection of candidates and
of productive activities; (c) training and technical supervision of selected
youth; (d) negotiated access of youth to land; and (e) community-based credit
mechanisms.
(d) Management of Natural Resources
Land-Use Planning and Policy
93.    Access  to  land will  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the
development of the agricultural sector. Land's rising opportunity coat will be
a powerful incentive for the more efficient use of other inputs. This evolution
should be supported by the gradual introduction of more rational land tenure
arrangements (freehold or rental) as well as land taxation. Although a legal
framework exists for land titling and registration, land taxation cannot be
introduced on a large scale in the short-term because of (a) the '-.ck of an
effective rural cadastre; and (b) the prevalence of traditional tenure systems
(less than 12 of the total farming area is registered and has a recognized
title). The Government should, however, initiate the necessary reforms through
pilot operations in suitable areas. Under the ASAL, the following measures will
be taken: (i) a satellite survey will be conducted to take stock of the current
land-use patterns and potential; and (ii) a pilot cadastral survey and land
titling project will be implemented in suitable areas, particularly in connection
with programs to provide rural youth with access to land.
Forestry
94.    The country's remarkable economic growth during the past two decades has
been based in part on the conversion of the rain forest into tree crops and
timber. However, if the current pace of deforestation continues, the Ivorian
forest will have disappeared by the year 2000.  Inadequate logging policies
(short leases based on area instead of volume of timber) and inappropriate fiscal
policies for wood processing and exports have allowed the appropriation by
private individuals of an excessive share of the value of standing timber,
encouraged waste, and led to a mining of the country's forest resources. An even
more important deforestation factor has been encroachment and indiscriminate
felling by farmers. The Government is aware of the seriousness of the problem.
A National Forestry Plan has been prepared which outlines the Government's
strategy in the sector. The Plan recognizes that the long-term protection of
natural forests will require (a) slowing down migration from the savanna to the
forest zone by reducing income disparities between the two zones; and (b)
developing sustainable, more intensive farming systems. In the short-term, the
Plan calls for the implementation of an emergency program for ti) delimitating
about 1.5 million ha of natural forests; (ii) strengthening the capabilities of
the field services of the Ministry of Forests to enforce a strict protection of



36
these forests; and (iii) carrying out forest inventory programs and management
plans (about 100,000 halyear), allowing the exploitation of these forests on a
sustainable basis. This program has been submitted to the Bank for financing.
The Government's early commitment to policy reforms in the logging and wood
processing areas is crucial for the successful implementation of this emergency
program.
95.    Under the ASAL and a Forestry Sector Project for which negotiations were
completed in July, the following measures will be undertaken:
(a)  carrying out before March 31, 1990 of an inventory of current
logging permit holders aimed at identifying and licensing only
professionally competent and adequately equipped logging operators
(Forestry Sector Project);
(b)  phasing out of the present logging permits (based on area) and
replacing them by permits based on standing volume of timber to be
sold at public auctions (Forestry Sector Project);
(c)  entering with selected logging/wood processing companies into long-
term contracts for the sustainable exploitation of natural forests
under agreed upon management plans (Forestry Sector Project); and
(d)  elimination of the current system of log export quotas and reforms
of fiscal policies in the logging/wood processing sector which will
(i) promote the efficient use of existing resources and (ii) ensure
the recovery by the Government of an adequate percentage of the
value of timber (ASAL).
PART VI. THE LOAN
A. Origin and Oblectives
96.    A proposal for an agricultural sector operation emerged during the
appraisal and implementation of the Third Structural Adjustment Loan.
Identification took place in early 1987. Detailed preparation started in October
1987 with the review of ongoing and planned public investments in the rural
sector and the discussion of the first draft of a Letter of Agricultural Policy
prepared by the Government.   An appraisal mission visited C8te d'Ivoire in
February 1988 and was followed by missions in February and May 1989. The primary
objective of the proposed ASAL is to provide continued Bank support to
Government's structural adjustment process and an underpinning for the first
two years of its medium-term adjustment program in agriculture. The ASAL will
also be a major component of the external financing package necessary for COte
d'Ivoire to resume economic growth and restore its creditworthiness.
B. Program Under the Loan
97.    The Government's agricultural sector adjustment program, presented in
its Letter of Agricultural Policy, covers a period of five years (1989-93).



37
The ASAL will cover the measures and actions to be taken during the first two
years of the program.   The matrix presented in Annex V sunmarizes both the
medium-term action program and the specific measures to be taken under the ASAL.
The working papers in the Technical Support Volume elaborate on the justification
for the above reforms and their projected fiscal and economic impact. Selected
measures crucial to the overall process of adjustment will be monitored as formal
conditions of Tranche Release and dated actions (Annex IV).
98.    The Government submitted before Board Presentation, along with its Letter
of Agricultural Policy (Appendix 1), letters indicating the actions or decisions
already taken to implement the agreed upon program, namely thats
(a) the 1989190 cocoa and coffee producer prices are set at CFAP 250/kg;
(b) a quality premium of CFAF 33/kg is introduced as of the start of
the 1989-90 season for coffee of the required quality standards;
(c) the producer price differential between the two categories of seed
cotton is increased to CFAF 30/kg, and 30Z of the insecticide
subsidies eliminated as of the start of the 1989-90 season. Further
cost  reduction  measures   (extension  and  processing  costs)
satisfactory to the Bank will be taken to eliminate CSSPPA's cotton
deficit during the 1989-90 season; and
(d) the first phase of BNDA's financial restructuring has been launched
and will be completed before March 31, 1990. Measures satisfactory
to the Bank have been taken to clarify BNDA's relationships with the
State, protect its depositors, and ensure its future financial
viability.
Accordingly, there is one special Condition of Effectiveness (First Tranche
Release) apart from the submission to the Bank of the standard legal opinion.
This is the presentation to the Bank of a satisfactory public finance plan
covering the period through the end of 1990. Table 7 below presents the key
measures for the release of the Loan's Second and Third Tranches. Presentation
to the Bank of a satisfactory macroeconomic program has been undertaken.
Satisfactory execution of the macroeconomic program is a condition for continued
Bank support for the agricultural adjustment operation.

C. Financing and Implementation Arrangements
99.    Financing. The agricultural sector adjustment program will be supported
by a Bank Loan of US$150.0 million, disbursed over a period of about 12 months
November 1989 to November 1990.  The African Development Bank (AfDB), the
Japanese Government and the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique have
indicated that they would cofinance the operation with loans of about US$150.0



40
million equivalent, US$50.0 million and US$20.0 million equivalent respectively.
The ASAL will therefore provide about 1OZ of Cote d'Ivoire's projected external
financing requirements over the July 1989-December 1990 period (about US$4.0
billion).
100.   Disbursements.   The Bank loan will be disbursed in three tranches of
equal amounts (US$50.0 million) against a negative list of inputs. The First
Tranche will be disbursed at effectiveness, expected in November 1989 shortly
after Board Presentation.  The Second and Third Tranches are expected to be
disbursed upon satisfactory implementation of the necessary measures, around
April and November 1990. A maximum of US$30.0 million would be disbursed against
payments made up to four months before loan signing.
101.   Procurement.   Lcan proceeds will finance the foreign expenditures of
goods imported into COte d'Ivoire from Bank member countries, Switzerland and
Taiwan, except specifically excluded items such as military and luxury goods.
Not more than US$60.0 million of loan proceeds will finance expenditures for
imports of petroleum and food products. All purchases, public and private, under
contracts amounting to US$5.0 million equivalent or more will be procured through
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Imports by the private sector under contracts of less than US$5.0 million
equivalent can be done in accordance with standard commercial practices. Goods
procured under contracts of less than US$15,000 equivalent will not be eligible
for Bank financing.  For all contracts above US$1.0 million equivalent, full
documentation will accompany withdrawal applications.  For contracts between
US$100,000 and US$1.0 million equivalent, full documentation will be retained
for examination by Bank staff and summarized in withdrawal applications submitted
to the Bank (description of goods, country of origin, date and currency of
payment, commercial banks involved, beneficiaries).
!02.   Accounts and Audits.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance and its Debt
Amortization Fund (CAM) will be responsible for administering the Loan. The CAM
will assemble the documentation necessary to support withdrawal applications and
maintain records of all transactions under the Loan in accordance with sound
accounting principles. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be
established at CM  on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.   Upon
effectiveness, the Bank will make an initial deposit of US$30.0 million
equivalent into this account. The account will be replenished up to the limit
of the successive tranches on the basis of disbursement applications supported
I.by appropriate documentation. Not later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year of the Borrower, the Special Account will be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. Audit reports will include a separate opinion
with regard to the justification submitted to the Bank for the disbursement of
its Loan.
D. Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation
103.   Management and Coordination.  Overall responsibility for the preparation
and supervision of the agricultural sector adjustment program has been given to
the Direction et Contr8le des Grands Travaux (DCGTx), an agency under the office
of the President of the Republic. The Government has also established a high
level Interministerial Coordinating Committee (CIC) to supervise program



41
implementation.   The CIC, which will meet every two months, is composed of
representatives of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, Forestry and Animal
Production. The Secretariat of the Committee is assured by DCGTx. The Committee
will prepare regular reports on program implementation and, at the end of the
Loan period, a detailed completion report.
104.   Monitoring and Evaluation.  Given the short disbursement period of the
Loan, the precise impact of the adjustment program will be difficult to assess
at the time of final disbursements.   Monitoring and Evaluation efforts are
therefore expected to focus on (a) ensuring the establishment of an adequate
data base to assess the magnitude of the economic response to the reforms over
the medium-term; and (b) monitoring the initial impact of key measures (in
particular the fiscal impact) to ensure that any correction, if necessary, is
made promptly.
E. Economic Justification and Social Impact and Risks
1.    Impact on Agricultural Growth
Past Performance
105.   From 1965 to 1980, the agricultural GDP increased on average by nearly
4Z per  annum  in  real terms.    Since  1980,  agricultural  growth  declined
dramatically, and is presently negative (see table-7 below). The Agricultural
Sector Adjustment Program has been designed to stimulate agricultural growth and
reverse this decline. Although the economic and agricultural policy adjustment
presently planned is necessary to increase agricultural growth, it will not be
sufficient in the long-term to permit agricultural growth to reach the 41 p.a.
target. The additional "sufficient' condition for 4Z agricultural growth is a
real exchange rate devaluation (see table 7 below).   (A real exchange rate
devaluation car be obtained either from nominal exchange rate devaluation, or
by a deflation of non-tradables prices relative to tradables prices, obtained
largely by cutting salaries and wages. The present strategy is to pursue the
latter  process  of  domestic  deflation.)    Working  Paper  No.  11  in  the
implementation volume quantifies the impact of each ASAL measure on agricultural
growth through models constructed using historical data. It also quantifies the
additional impact obtainable from a real exchange rate adjustment.
106.   Export Crops.  The most important commodities are coffee and cocoa which
presently represent about 34? of the total value of COte d'Ivoire's agricultural
production. The major determinants of coffee production, besides rainfall, are
on-farm investments (both private and public), the prices of coffee and cocoa
and farm input use. The changes in coffee incentives introduced under the ASAL
(quality price premium and improved marketing), the investments foreseen under
Government's coffee rehabilitation program, and a greater relative decrease in
the price of cocoa (cocoa and coffee planting substitute easily for each other)
are projected to result in an increase in the quantity of coffee produced of
about 1.5? p.a. over the medium-term compared with its continued 3.0? p.a.
decline without the measures. Cocoa production increased at the extraordinary
rate of 8? p.a. in Cate d'Ivoire in the 1965-86 period.  This resulted from
advantageous prices, and from migration into the forest area where migrants



42
claimed land by planting tree crops, the easiest and most profitable of which
being cocoa. Without policy change, cocoa production would continue to grow at
about 3? p.a. due to the artificially high fixed domestic price. This growth
is lower than in the past because without policy measures introduced under ASAL
the Government would have difficulty financing the high (subsidized) support
price. Many farmers would not be paid. With the policy measures, the value of
cocoa production is projected to grow even more slowly, at about 1? p.a. due to
the relatively greater financial incentives given to coffee production as well
as the reduced domestic price of cocoa. Cocoa will benefit only from impraved
and cheaper marketing. Reduced production will be partly compensated by higher
world prices resulting from lower Ivorian production (the elasticity of world
price of cocoa with respect to Ivorian exports is about -0.2 in the short-term
and -0.3 in the long-term).
107.   Other major export crops include cotton, rubber, palm oil, pineapples,
bananas, and coconut. With no policy change, production of these export crops
will stagnate, after a decline in 1988 and 1989. With the new policy measures
under ASAL, the major difference is in higher producer prices permitted by the
export subsidies, expanded credit and investment, and reduced marketing costs.
Growth will resume in 1990, moving to an average rate of 4.52 p.a. until 1995
(which is lower than the average growth rate of 1O0 achieved over the 1965-84
period). A real exchange rate devaluatior would push the growth of production
of these export crops to at least 6? p.a.
108.   Food Production. The Agriculture'  Sector Adjustment Program will benefit
rice production by liberalizing domest c marketing, and support domestic meat
production by introducing antidumping tariffs on imported meat.   Domestic
marketing costs would be greatly reduced for rice and meat. All food crops will
benefit from additional tariff protection offsetting the negative effect of
currency over-valuation. Improved credit availability will also stimulate food
production. With the new policy measures, prices of imported food will increase
relative to domestic food, and domestic production will start substituting for
imported food at the rate of about 21 p.a.  The result is a growth of food
production at 4Z p.a. in quantitative terms. With a real devaluation, further
real price increases result in an even higher growth (at about 5? p.a.) due to
more rapid import substitution. Without the new policy measures, there would
be a continued rapid expansion of imports of food and meat, and a consequent
continued loss of market share held by local producers.   Production would
continue to increase at its recent rate of 1.02 p.a. while food imports would
increase at 3.5? p.a.
109.   Forestry.  Without the new policy measures under ASAL, the real value of
forestry production is projected to increase at its 1980-87 historical rate of
0.6? p.a. until 1995.  However, it would collapse thereafter because of the
severe depletion of resources. Under the ASAL, conservation measures will result
in no growth until 1995. However, protection and better management measures
(both at logging and processing levels) will increase exploitable resources and
production will thereafter expand by about 1X per annum.
110.   In aggregate terms, with the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Program, real
agricultural growth (measured at value added in 1987 prices) would increase from
its present level of negative 2.8? growth in 1989, to 2.5? p.a. growth during



43
1990-1995 (Table 8 below).   If the real exchange rate can be devalued,  in
combination with the agricultural adjustment program, agriculture would grow at
about its 4X p.a. historical rate. COte d'Ivoire achieved an average growth rate
of about 42 p.a. in the 1960s and 1970s. Because agriculture accounts for 302
of GDP, the reforms introduced under the ASAL are expected to add about 11 p.a.
to the country's overall GDP growth from 1990 onwards.

2. Tmpact on Government Finances
111.  Until  1986,  the  Government  extracted  significant  resources  from
agriculture. In 1986 agricultural export taxes, CSSPPA surplus and duties on
imported agricultural inputs amounted to CFAF 240 billion.  In 1987, the net
Government's surplus on coffee and cocoa exports declined to CFAF 36 billion
due to the continued drop in world commodity prices combined with a real
appreciation of the exchange rate and unchanged domestic producer prices. Cotton
and other crops moved to deficit. The Government's other expenditures in favor
of the agricultural sector continued to remain high (large financial deficit of
the agricultural parastatals, annual losses of BNDA, public expenditures on
agriculture and operating costs of CSSPPA). The effect was a net loss to the
Government in 1987 on its agricultural account of about CFAF 37 billion (US$120
million  equivalent).    The  situation worsened  in  1988  with  Government's
agricultural account accumulating a net loss of about CFAF 77 billion (USS 230
million). The deterioration was caused by losses to Government in maintaining
the domestic farm price of cocoa and coffee as world pric@s declined.   The
projection for 1989 is worse still (loss of CPAP 172 billion, or US$555 million



44
equivalent).    Table  9  below  shows  this  worsening  situation  without  ASAL.
Agriculture's contribution to the total public sector deficit increases from
about 171 in 1987 to 341 in 1989, and 38Z by 1995.

112. The ASAL contains measures to stimulate growth which increase public
expenditures, such as a quality price premium for coffee, an expanded public
investment program in agriculture, the provision of export subsidies to export
diversification crops and expenditures on natural resources and forestry
conservation. However, under the ASAL important public saving measures will also
be introduced (i.e., BNDA restructuring, public enterprise restructuring,
reduction in cocoa and coffee prices, reduction of farm input subsidies, reduced
export crop marketing costu supported by the stabilization fund and increased
taxation of the logging industry). The projections show that, globally, the net
impact of Government's agricultural adjustment program on public finance will
be positive from the start. In 1989, reductions in coffee and cocoa prices and
marketing costs of the stabilization fund reduce Government's loss on its
agricultural account by about CPAF 37 billion (US$120 million).   Prom 1990
onward, the positive effects of ASAL's measures on agricultural growth will come
on stream and generate additional fiscal revenues. The deficit in Government's
account with agriculture will be greatly reduced in 1990 with ASAL to US$85
million equivalent, which constitutes a sharp drop from the US$666 million
equivalent expected deficit without ASAL.  The remaining deficit represents
legitimate expenditure by Government on agricultural services, agricultural
export subsidies, and remaining Caistab expenses.   With ASAL, Government's
deficit on its agricultural account constitutes only 81 of the public finance
gap.   By 1995, agriculture becomes nearly self-sufficient (Government's net
account with agriculture drops to a loss of US$27 million equivalent).

3. Impact on Rural Incomes
113. In 1984 (the last year for which reliable data are available), the average
per capita disposable income in COte d'Ivoire was about CFAF 242,000 (1984
prices), or about US$800 equivalent. With per capita disposable income estimated
to be 3.5 times higher in the urban sector compared with the rural sector, Cate
d'Ivoire's poor are largely rural.   The majority of those living below the
poverty line are farmers (37? of export crop farmers and 50? of food crop farmers
live  below  the  poverty  line).    Within  the  rural  sector,  income  varies
considerably by region; in the North (Savanna) it is about 70? of the overall
average for rural areas, while in the forest areas it is higher. The incidence
of poverty is therefore significantly greater in the Savanna (about 60? of the
population living below the 30? cut-off poverty line), followed by the East
Forest (45? living below the poverty line), and the West Forest (21X). The urban
areas are better off (13Z of urban dwellers outside Abidjan and 5? in Abidjan
live below the poverty line).



47
114. The rural population will greatly benefit from the reforms introduced
under the ASAL. Without the ASAL, sluggish agricultural growth in the medium-
term (about 1.02 p.a.) would induce a decline of per capita incomes in rural
areas of about 1.5Z p.a. at the projected level of rural population increase
(2.52 p.a.). The reforms introduced under the ASAL will permit the resumption
of a sustainable growth of about 2.5 p.a. in the sector. This translates into
stability of rural per capita incomes. With real devaluation of the exchange
rate, this would increase to 1.5? p.a. growth in real income.
115. There will be a wide distribution of these benefits within the rural
sector. Major beneficiaries will bet
(a)   diversification export crop producers (in the forest zone) due to
the export crop promotion program; export subsidies, greater credit
availability, reduced marketing costs and market liberalization;
(b)   livestock producers (largely in the savanna, but some distributed
throughout the country) due to the anti-dumping measures, the
national livestock develop4ment program, expanded credit availability
and liberalization of domestic marketing;
(c)   cotton producers (in the Savanna) due to the cotton investment
program, increased quality price premium for high quality cotton,
reduced cotton marketing costs;
(d)   food crop producers  (in all rural areas) due to more edequate
protection against imported food, better extension services, expanded
credit, and market liberalization.
116.  Cocoa and coffee producers will lose because of the reduction in the
producer price of these products.   These producers are, however, relatively
well-off compared to other farmers and a large proportion also grow other export
crops and food crops. They will benefit from the ASAL measures affecting other
crops.  The drop in the coffee producer price will be offset by the quality
premium and incentives given under Government's coffee rehabilitation program.
Reduced marketing costs will also benefit cocoa and coffee farmers. The net
impact of the ASAL on coffee farmers is likely to be approximately neutral. It
will be strongly negative for cocoa farmers.
4. Impact on the Urban Sector
117. In 1984, disposable per capita income in the urban sector averaged
US$1,200.   However, there is poverty in urban areas among informal sector
employees and the unemployed. These people spend a large portion of their income
on food (about 40?). Therefore, food prices are likely to increase under the
ASAL (due to higher protection against cheap imports of food and meat) and reduce
their real income even further. This increase has been estimated to be about
4? p.a. faster with the policy reforms introduced under ASAL than without them;
this means an effective decline in the income of the urban poor of about 1.52
per annum, which corresponds to the removal of the implicit subsidy which has
been borne until now by the rural population (indeed, many of the urban poor are



48
people who left rural areas due to the lack of sustainability of their rural
existence). In addition, the ASAL will affect public sector employment in both
rural and urban areas as restructured public enterprises reduce staff.
118. Offsetting the above in the medium-term will be an expansion of urban jobs
in agro-industry, stimulated by accelerated agricultural growth. Jobs will be
available in the coffee, cotton, export crop, and meat industries, as well as
in the domestic food industry. These indirect benefits will however develop
slowly while the costs of the reform program supported by ASAL in terms of loss
of public sector jobs and of higher food prices will happen quickly. For these
reasons, the Bank is preparing with the Government a 'social dimensions of
adjustment' program and a project to assist youth and former parastatal employees
to establish themselves in the agricultural sector.   The latter project is
already in operation in the field as a pilot.
5. Risks
119. The major risk in this operation is a possible inadequate government
commitment due to political resistance. COte d'Tvoire's structural adjustment
process has been underway for nearly eight years. It has so far mostly been a
process of economic contraction. Per capita incomes have declined, especially
among the well-to-do and the urban population. While this has led to greater
income equality, it has also led to social and political tension in the urban
areas.   The political strength of the President of COte d'Ivoire has been
critical in maintaining the adjustment process. Yet the strains are increasingly
apparent. The ASAL, together with the macroeconomic policy reforms agreed upon
with the IMF, will stimulate more rapid growth. However, its benefits to farmers
and to the poor will only be felt after several years, hence the political risk
in the short-term. More drastic contractionary measures will be required in a
follow-up phase, increasing the political risk. Counterpart funds from the ASAL
will be used by the Government to reduce the negative impact on such groups,
through job-creating investments in projects with more financial and economic
potential than those in the public sector being phased out. Nevertheless, the
risk remains important.
120. A second risk is linked to a further drop in world prices for Cate
d'Ivoire's major export commodities in 1990-91, and a further real appreciation
of the exchange rate. In this case, the Government's support of producer prices
may become financially insupportable.   If the support prices are not paid,
agriculture may become unprofitable, farmers will revert to subsistence
agriculture, and migration to the cities may accelerate. The danger will be
greatest in 1989 and 1990. The Bank's latest world price projections have been
used to project growth, debt service and other economic aggregates.   These
projections suggest that world prices for Ivorian agricultural exports are
currently at the bottom of their cyclical dip, and that the downside risk is
therefore low.

I. IN?RODtJCTON
Macroeconomic Sackaround
1.   The Goverment of Cate d'2voire launched its economic recovery program at
the beginning of the 1980s with the public and parapublic sectors as the main
focus. Despite some initial success and a temporary resumption of growth in
1985 and 1986, progress under the program was inadequate and a sudden, acute
deterioration in the external environment further reduced the prospects for a
return to sustainable growth. The main goals of the economic adjustment progra:
include a reduction of the role of the State and expansioan of the role of the
private sector. containment o,! the public finance gap and tighter control of
external borrowing. These goals remain valid, but it is now clear that because
of the external shock to the econcmy, in particular the drop in world prices for
cocoa. coffee and cotton which are Cate d'Zvoire's major export coumodities,
they will take longer to achieve than originally expected.
2.   Zn addition, a transition period from adjustment to sustainable economic
growth is necessary if these goals are to be achieved at all. Four elements are
crucial during this period. First, the public sector will have to continue to
sustain economic growth by maintaining direct investment at least at 1988 leve.;
for the duration of the crisis because private sector response to structural
adjustmet has so far been limited due largely to recession and the continued
crisis situation. Second, the program of nationwide austerity will have to be
continued. Third, the financial coamitment of the international donor communi:-
will have to be sustained. Finally, the Government will need to maintain both
its commitment to meet external obligations and a minimum program of productive
investments. This will require a steep inerease in the flow of financing, from
CFAF 380 billion in 1987 to CFAF 600 billion in 1990 but without these funds,
Cote d'tvoire will face a persistent recession that will wipe out the gains
achieved thus far and lead inevitably to a lasting loss of confidence among the
population.
Public n_vestMe_A in Agrigulture
3.   Despite its financial constraints. the Government remains committed to
maintaining total sector financing (public investment plus investment credit t_
the private sector) consistent with the ongoing economic recovery program targe:
of 4Z annual growth of gross domestic agricultural product. This will require
financing approximately CFAF 100 billion per annum of agricultural investment
to:
-    improve sector performanee rapidly, particularly in terzs of cost
effectiveness, to meet domestic needs as fully as possible and
increase exports steadily; and



76
Appendix 1
Page 3 of 20
encourage increased private sector initiative and vitality as the
foundation. of furter dsvlopuat in the sector.
4.  Continuing the export subsidy system ad increasing rural incomes will have
a revitalizing effect on the sector, provided the international situation
Improwes. The Government intends to support raeitalization of the sector not
only through direct investment but through a progran of appropriate actions in
the transportation, utilities and social services focused specifically on
agriculture and designed to deepen th lpsct of earlier adjuitment measures.

S.   The Governmet conttues to attach the higest priority to the agricultura.
policy broadly outlined in its Economic Policy Statemnt of April 30, 1986.
Studies needed for restructuring the public agricultural sector have been done
and the Govement as mde cosiderable progress toward rehabilitating the
major agricultural delopment agencies.  This effort will be continued and wiV'
lead ultimately to the reorganLiation i agricultural extension, credit and
research service.

- imple- -ation of the coffee. rehabilitation, rubber and oil palm
plans bps been delayed:
- a value-added tax on the primry processing of agricultural products
has not yet been introduced; and
- the restructuring of public agricultural enterprises is behind
schedule.
These delays are mainly due to three factorst i) prerequisits basic studies, for-
instanc  the imact of a value-added tax oan consmer prices, bd not been
carried out: ii) adequate financial resources were not available; and iii) the
timetable proposed vas not realistic.
S.   The Governent has therefore decided to enunciate more rigorously its
medium-tetm strategy and objectives for each subsector and to make effective
arrangeAmets for conducting the studies needed for implewntation of its
agricultural policy. This strategy is founded oa diversification of
agricultural activities, better mangesent of existing traditional resources a=:
systematic exploitation of the country's natural comparative advantages. In
particular: i) the cultivation of new crops vill be expanded: ii) the coffee
subsector will be rehabilitated: iii) productivity in the cocoa subsector will
be improved: iv) the goal of food self-sufficiency will be pursued through
intensified research oan food crops; and v) the value of C8te dIlvoires natural
forests will be protected and enhanced.
9. The Government will continue to improve the terms of domestic trade in
favor of the sector and raise rural incomes in real teras by reinforcing
incentives, increasing rural investment, public and private, and making rural
institutions more effective. The Government also intends to modernize the mear.
of production as oe way of improving productivity and to promte the
developmat of a youag and dyamic sallholder class.
lIZ. EXPOR? CROP
10. The Govegment will continue its major efforts to consolidate present gai.:
in the traditional export crops subsector thereby increasing export revenue and.
at the sam  tim, achieve better risk distribution through massive investment
diversification crops. These efforts will focus ons i) rehabilitation of the
coffee and the banana-pineapple subsectors; ii) reorienting activities in the
oil palm subsector; iii) consolidation of the cotton subsector; and
iv) development of the rubber sector. Complemetary measures to make the
economic environmet moae attractive to private investors will also be
introduced.
Coffee and Cocoa
11. Given the satisfactory trends in the cocoa subsector, the Govegnrent
proposes to concentrate its efforts on coffee rehabilitation which is a major
component of structural adjustment in the agricultural sector and is



78
Appendix 1
Page 5 of 20
indispensable to the reestablishment of financial equilibrium in the
coffee-cocoa subsector over the medium-term. If the downtrend in coffee output
is not reversed, production is likely to drop from 200,000 metric tons (1988) to
150,000 by the year 2000. The Government's goel is not only to arrest this
decline but to restore output potential to 350,000 tons of marketable coffee by
the year 2000. The rehabilitation program currently being implemented will be
redirected tos
-    encourage the stumping/densification program, through a substantial
increase in the stumping subsidy (currently CFAP 80,000 per ha).
Sufficient budget funds will be earmarked for prompt payment of
subsidies to allow stumping of 45,000 ha annually. This program is
expected to cost up to CFAF 6.75 billion per annum and to yield an
additional 90,000 metric tons of coffee annually by the year 2,000:
-    increase the replanting subsidy (currently CPAF 145,000 per ha) as an
incentive for additional replanting. Budget allocations will be
sufficient to allow replanting of 20,000 ha a year;
-    increase the production and distribution of improved planting material
by rehabilitating and expanding nurseries and encouraging greater
private sector,involvement in the distribution of inputs. This
program is expected to cost up to CIAF S billion per annum and result
in* 1) production of an additional 110,000 metric tons annually by
the year 2,000; ii). stabilization of the average age of coffee stands.
at a little under 22 years (currently 20); and ii) wide-scale
introduction of higher-yielding varieties.
-    establishment a quality premium to be administered by the coffee
processing plants. The necessary budget allocations will be made to
met the estimated annual cost of ClAP 5 billion.  gstablishment of
the premLum is expected to have an immediate impact on coffee quality,
leading to a substantial drop in transportation, processing and other
costs and increased volume and value of coffee exports.
12. This program will consist of precise, concrete actions almed at obtaining a
the highest possible quality product but it vill be flexibly designed so that
rapid adjustments can be made to meet changes in the external enviroment.
Subsidy payments, physical implementation of the stumping and replanting
program, and the real Impact of the proposed measures on output and quality
will be closely monitored. SAITMCI, the agency responsible for technical
extension services and payment of stumping and replanting subsidies, will be
reorganized to enable it to prolde effective follow up oan actions ilitiated
under the agricultural oxtenslau i.rooect.
13. A detailed analysis of the marketing system will identify appropriate
measures for ensuring that the collection of agricultural products, the
reception of trucks at processing plants, and the utilization of the processing
plants themselves are rationally organized. Transportation and processing costs
under these new arrangements will be analyzed and remuneration amended
accordingly.

14. Producer Prlces. The Government will continue its policy of stabilization.
vith the twin objectives of allowing for medium-term changes in world market
prices while protecting prod&scers from sharp price fluctuations over short
periods. More generally, a review will be carried out of the whole system of
agricultural pricing, long-term taxation levels, the allocation of government
revenue generated by the agricultural sector, and the role and operations of
stabilization and regulatory entities. The review will identify ways to
increase private sector involvement in the purchasing process and motivate
farmers to improve quality of their product.
CroM Diversification
15. The Government will continue its involvement in crop diversification both
as a direct actor, investing in the most remunerative crops and improving the
effectiveness of the concerned public enterprises, and as an indirect actor, by
providing incentives for private initiative through minimum prices, export
subsidies, and by making investment credit available.
16. Minimum Prices. The Government intends gradually to introduce a system of
guaranteed minimum producer prices which, as for producers of traditional export
crops, reflects world market prices while protecting against sharp fluctuations
in those prices.  GCto  is stili the only reliable source of cash income in the
savana zone and the Stabilization Fund (Caisse de Stabilisation) will continue
to set a minimum price annually. Coconut and oil oalm minimum prices will also
be set anually by decree for crops produced on small- and medium-sized farms.
A subsector stabilization fund, part of the Expansion and Recovery Fund (FER),
will be set up to support this minimum price; the necessary resources will come
from part of any surpluses in the operating accounts of smallholder and medium
farms (as provided under the program contract signed with PALMINDUSTRIE). The
stabilization mechanism already set up and administered by APROMAC in the rubber
subsector will be maintained.
17. Value-Added Tax. This will be gradually extended to agricultural and
agro-industrial products but maesures wll be taken to avoid any increase in
domestic market prices or a sharp drop in government revenues derived from such
products. In most cases, this will mean application of the new super-reduced
VAT, currently fixed at 5Z.
18. Ixnort Subsidies will be extended to all agricultural products other than
coffee, cocoa, cotton and lumber. In the case of pineapples, they will be
introduced as part of a subsector rehabilitation plan: for bananas, they will
apply only to exports to markets other than the protected French market.
19. Technica1. Finascial and Personnel Manazement. Efforts already being made
by CIDT, PALMINDUSTRI, SAPS and SO0 to Improve their performance will be
intensified. Medium-term objectives will be defined in terms of productivity
gains and accounting systems will be introduced to clearly separate operations
undertaken by these institutions on their own behalf from those undertaken on
behalf of the State. A detailed analysis will be undertaken of the entire cost

chain, as a prerequisite to introducing measures that will put agency operation:
on a sounder footing. PALM4M6DUSTRIE will prepare a strategic sector developmen:
plan, based on an exploratory study of the domestic and regional oil-seed
market. The plan will include 8 medium-tem program to develop and diversify
PAL4NDUSTRUE's activities.  The Government will enter into a program contract
with CZDT specifying the agency's medium-term goals for improvement of its
technical and financial management and the transfer of its input distribution
activities to the cooperative and private sectors.
20.  Public Invesme   Proaras.  Public investment in agriculture will be
expanded and existing programs redirected. The Fifth Rubber Project (4.000 ha
per annum) will be supplemented by a further project (6,000 ha per annum
beginning in 1990) with the ultimate goal of bringing about 10,000 ha per annum
under rubber. The Oil palm plan, currently in jeopardy because of
PALMniDUSTRU's constrained resources, will be redesigned to concentrate on
regious where oil palm production is most productive; additional financial
resources will be allocated to its implemetation (3,000/ha per annum of
roplantinge and 12.000 ha per annum of now plantings).  New crops will be
introduced in the savanna zones a soybean project is to be designed with the
assistance of Brazilian specialists, and CIDT is to experiment with a
smalLholder sunflower schem.  Measures will be taken which focus on attracting
more smllholders into these program and oan providing start-up assistance for
young farmers.
21.-: Studies.- Studieswill. de done on the entire banana production chain and oa
the marketing of fresh pineapples to identify ways of putting the
banana-pineapple subsector on a more rational footing. The role and operation
of SODEFEL will be redexined as part of this process.
rV. FOOD CROP DEVELOPMENT
22. Given the growing pressure of external constraints, particularly the
country's indebtaeness and the depressed world markets for tropical products,
and in view of the disquieting trend of rapid urban growth accompanied by a
'decline in per capita urban income, the Government will increase support for
food production. The objective is to lower production costs without reducing
farmer income. The Government will therefore follow a food crop development
policy based in the short-term on incentives to increase smallholder output, an_
iL the medium-term oan promoting the modernization of private-sector agricultura:
production systems.
Jncentives for Food Production
23. The Government wants to go beyond mere domestic food security. always
guaranteed in the past. Its aim will be to enhance the country's level of food
self-sufficiency and contribute to improving food self-sufficiency in the enti:e
Vest African region. The Government's food output iacentive policy is based s.:
only on C6te d'Ivoire's potential to increase cereal production rapidly, but
also oan modernizing the distribution channels for other foodstuffs and on
developing a sound seed industry.



81
Appendix 1
Page 8 of 20
24. Cereal oroduction. The Government will continuo its support for rice
production which is ati.1l much too low and meets only S02 of domestic demand.
Maize production will be encouxaged, since the number of available industrial
outlets and export opportunities is increasing rapidly. One advantage of both
these staples is that satisfactory storage facilities for them already exist.
The Goverrment has chosen two major avenues for this supports i) distribution 0 Z
selected seed to smallholders who are receiving assistance frm an extension
organizations and iU) rehabilitation of existing rice-growing bottomlands and
establishment of new ones. The Government will introduce a program to
rehabilitate CIDY, giving it a structure, staff, and operating system better
suited to it,  ssion.
25. Food plan objectives for 1966-1990 focus on increasing the supervised
production of rainfed pady by 190,000 mtric tons, irrigated paddy by 40.000/t.
maize by 230,000 t. and groundnuts, which can be rotated with other crops on
mchanized fams, by 1Z,000 t.
26.   c.  Given that domestic supply does not yet satisfy demand, attention
will be paid to the increasingly marcked differeaces between two complementary
markets, one for the high-quality local product, much appreciated by Ivorian
consumers, and the other for industrial or imported rice. whose main attraction
is its very low price. The Government intends to conduct a thorough study of
th. whole rice production chain before deciding an new ways to intervene in the
subsector. Its goal will be to move gradually toward deregulation of domestic
purchasing, processing and marketing of the local product while retaining a
minima paddy price fixed by decree and a governmeat-controlled consumer price
on imported rice.
27. Other stagles. Since considerable seasonal surpluses of other staple crc-s
sometimes occur. priority will given to marketing and processing starches,
fruits and vegetables rather than to their production. The Government's first
concern will be to create a national marketing network for food products by
establishing appropriate infrastructure facilities and an efficient informaticr.
system available to the private sector. At the same time, research institutes
working on the conservation and processing of these products will be encouraged
to greater efforts.  Pilot projects will be set up to promote out-of-season c.--
cultivation. The Sinmatiali project area will be rehabilitated and its
agri-foodstuffs complex transferred to the private sector as part of the move
toward a recovery in market-garden production.
The Lational Seed Plaa. This plan is an essential component of the Gover=nant':
food policy. Its objective is to meet the entire demand for certified seed frz=
the development corporations by 1991. Demand figures in 1991 are projected at
15,000 metric tons for rice and 6,000 t for maize. The mis2ion of the recently
created Office des Semences et des Plants is to certify seed and coordinate the
selection, production, multiplication and distribution of certified seed in Ct--
d'lvoire. It is also responsible for transferring the management of State sees
farms, which it now handles itself on an interim basis, to the private sector
and for the development, under private contract, of irrigated seed production
operations at Sedrbou.



82
Appendix 1
Page 9 of 20
28, Selected seed Ls 4*stributed free to farmers cultivating heir crops under
supervision. growers are therefore likely to realize tne importance of selecte-
seed very quickly. It will be necessary to identify ways of increasing the
volume of seed produced for use by non-supervised growers and, subsequently, fez
the regional West African market, which is already interested in the Ivorian
product. A study to be undertaken shortly will examine ways and means of
achieving full privatixation of the seed production apparatus thus created.
Accordingly. a reduction in the seed subsector subsidy can be anticipated.
Farm Modernization
29. The GoverAmet is determined to accelerate the modernization of smallholde:
farming to meet its medium term growth targets and increase the competitiveness
of the Ivorian econmy. This effort will include the development of new
agricultural land as well as farm mechanization and farmer training but the
principal focus will be on food growing and on types of farming activity suited
to the savanna gone, where current famer income levels preclude spontaneous
change oc developments in traditional farming methods.  The Government's chief
conceri is to achieve a significant increase in the productivity of savanna-zone
food growing, which is currently at a level that hiAders the development of
cash-crop farming. CIDT will undertake a project specifically designed to
promote the moderniaation of savanna agriculture, the funding for which will
therefore not be included in the allocations to cotton production.
V. LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS
30. A recent discussion paper oan livestock production and its prospects for the
period up to the year 2000 has provided a comprehensive policy picture. - this
major subsector of Ivorian agriculture. Allowing for the constructive results
achieved in the course of 15 years of carefully planned and diversified action
to promote both the traditional and modern styles of livestock production, the
Government now wishes to reduce still further the country's dependence on
imported animal products by increasing self-sufficiency in beef, veal and eggs
from its 1983 level of 462 to 612 by the year 2,000. Production targets for the
year 1.000 in each of the following subsectors are: beef, veal. mutton and goat
meat. 46,000 metric tons (+/145*); pork. 19.000 t (C 190S); poultry, 49,000 t
(* 2002): eggs, 38,000/t (+ 245S); and milk, 44,000 t (. 175S).
31. After an initial phase of direct intervention in production and marketing
systems, the Government now intends to create economic conditions favorable to
the development of modern livestock production through private initiative. In
order to do so. it will take new, ad hoc measures in livestock pricing, credit,
processing, marketing, and feed production.
Marketing OraanigaztIon
32. Based oan the *production chain" concept, livestock development policy is
designed first and foremost to build up the start-to-finish organization of the
major animal products so as to guarantee both stable outlets for Ivorian output
and the provisioning of the country's urban markets at minimal economic cost.



83
Appendix 1
Page 10 of 20
33. The Government intends 1. withdraw from all direct intervention in '
marketing systems.  Depending on the findings of ongoing studies, it expects to
be able to set in place mechanisms that will eliminate price distortions caused
by the existence of subsidized external sources of supply and to aend the
legislative and regulatory texts govemning the live animal and meat markets,
thus paving the way for their more rapid modernization. The master plan study
for animal-product marketing, processing and distribution infrastructures will
identify the facilities that need to be created.
Modernization of Production
34. The modernization of livestock production, essential if government
objectives are to be achieved, should make it possible not only to Increase
domstic supply rapidly but also to reduce average production costs.   n this
regard, the Government proposes to withdraw from direct production activities
sad transfer the production units created by the State to the private sector.
It will support private-sector initiatives for the creation of breeding and
fattening enterprises, (particularly where short-cycle products are concerned)
by means of a new policy of access to agro-industrial byproducts, appropriate
credit facilities, and greater security of land tenure.
bfoitorina And Sunurt Masr.es
35.  Zn order to maximize the domestic supply of animal products, the Governmes:
proposes to continue supporting traditional Livestock farmers through carefully
focused animal health and pasture development programs and the systematic
approach to regional extension projects. It also proposes to continue the
present genetic selection and research effort by launching new pilot operations.
Animal Reslth. The State will retain its role in project identification,
programming and monitoring but will encourage private entrepreneurs and farmers
to take over those activities that they are able to handle. The industrial
beef-fattening complex at Ferkess4dougou will be privatized. Obligatory
vaccinations against the most dangerous diseases will still be available free o-
charge but famers will be ezpected to met some of the cost of preventive and
curative health measures for cattle and sheep and the entire cost of such
measures for short-cycle types of livestock.
36. The State will increase its support for vocational training centers for
livestock farmers and the respective roles of the Administration. SODEPRA and
private-sector operators will be re-examined as part of the process of
formulating medium-term development programs for the sector.
Fish-faMInS and 7isheries
37. C8te d'Zvoire imports approximately 100.000 metric tons of fish a year at
very low unit value for a total outlay of CFAF 17 billion, while exporting
canned tuna and frozen shrimp with a value of CFAF 21 billion. The goal is to
maintain or improve this trade surplus.



84
Appendix 1
Page 11 of 20
38. The Governmnent proposes to reinforce the measures already taken to develct
the potential of the country's rivers and lakes and to provide extension
services for fishermen and fish-facmers. Its aims are to increase output:
..   partly for domestic consumption, where can be expected to increase b,.
20,000.25,000 t by the year 2000:
and partly for export, where the goal is to achieve an increase of
approximately 15.000 t of tuna and 3,000.t of shellfish by the year
2000.
Governmet financing required for the livestock and fisheries subsectors is
esatimated to total CYAF 10 billion a year.
VI. FOBESSRY SECTOR RECOVERY
39. At the begianing of the century, Cate d'Zvoire possessed 15 milllon ha of
dense tropical forest. By 1966, this figure had dropped to 9 million ha by
1966, by 1977 to 6,000 and by 1982, to 3.5 million. It is now a mere 2.5
million. TZ keeping wi h the decline in forest area, timber production. which
peaked at 5.3 million a  in 1977, dropped to 3.9 million in 1984, 3.2 million
1985 and to under 3 million in 1986.
40. -The reasons.for this have been known for a consideZable time:  clearing f:-
agricultural purposes (even within national forest estates). which destroys the
forest; inadequate control of operations which overextract valuable species in
high demand to the point that they di4appear completely: and brushfires, which
are taking a greater and greater toll of forests stands.
41.  The Governmet proposes to launch a vigorous forestry recovery effort base,-
on the Rational. Forest Plan and the materials produced by the Water and Forest
Resources Seminar. Its immediate aims are:
to safeguard the nation0s forest resources without damaging the
economic potential of plantaci%nns and crops established at governmen:
expense: this will be achieved by declaring a total of 4.7 million h.a
to be national forast estate. 3 million ha in the forest zone itsel'
and 1.7 million ha in the savanna zone;
-    to restore C6te d'Ivlire's timber output potential to its early 198Cs
level of 4 million a per annum, by reversing the trend of
Cncroachment on, and impoverishment of the natural forest.
42. Since the only feasible way to protect the country's forests is to enhanca
their effective asset value. the Goverment has decided to proceed
simultaneously with a forest management and development program and a program
for conservation of the national forest endowment. These will complement other
ongoing general environmental protection programs.

Management and Develooment of Nsturzl Forests
43. The Government has decided on the gradual introduction of a now method fo:
the management and development of classified forests that is based on the active
participation of private enterprises and rural coammunities in the whole range o:
activities directed toward the conservation, value enhancement and management c.
permanent State forest stands. This new method calls firstly for a concessions
system under which the State cam enter into long-term (20-50 year) contracts
with logging companies, and secondly for.a system of extraction permits that
stipulate what volumes of timber and what forest species may be extracted
anwually by each concession holder.
44.  Beginning tn 1990, three pilot managemnt-log"ing projects will be launche:
in stages with private sectot participation. These are expected to identify the
type of legislative and regulatory action (for instance, LA amending the Forest
Code) will be nceded as a basis for these management-logging contracts.
inventory work on each of the forest areas targeted for these pilot projects haz
already begun in conjunction with the firs concerned. Provisional
management-logging contracts will be entered into by end-1991. They will
specify the obligations of both parties as to conservation, inventory,
management and exploitation over the course of the traasition phase, which is
expected to lead to the signature of definitive long-term contracts.
45. Beginning in 1989, a survey of temporary felling permits will be conducted
and an inventory of holders' technical qualifications and operating equipment
set up. This will make it possible to redefine the minimum technical
qualifications and equipment standards to be met before an applicant can be
granted a logging peamit contractor and tb define the appropriate procedure.
46. Beginning in 1990. the old temporary felling permits will be gradually
replaced by logging permits granted only to officially recognized logging
contractors and against payment of a minimum royalty based on the economic val_:a
of the standing timber. Simultaneously, the Government will join forces with
the private sector to undertake experiments in modernizing logging methods and
techniques. It will also conduct a diagnostic review of the timber processing
and marketing subsector and will support the launching of economically viable
projects.
Forest Conservation Pro2ram
47. The Gover%ment intends to undertake a parallel and ambitious program of
safeguarding and extending the national forest endowment. This program will be
based on a strategy of protection. restoration and expansion of the forest
cover. It will include:
-    an emergency protection plan calling for the mapping of all forest
land by 1992, the delineation of all forest reserve areas by 1995.  ._z
the strengthening of forest ranger services by increasing the presen--a
of Forest and Water Resources Department personnel in the field;

facest inventories and tree.cover-developmnt studies to provide the
basis for programed development of forest reserves (50,000 ha per
year) through related measures fog the upgrading of natural stands a..:
reforestation, the latter to be concentrated in severely degraded and
fallow forestst
_    continuing with ongoing coamrcial reforestation efforts (5,000/ha per
year) with the objective of achieving a major reduction in the cost c-
implementing such programs:
-    lay the foundation for a general extension of the country's forests,
particularly in the preforest and savatna zones, using: (a) measures
for the prevention of brush and forest fires; and (b) reforestation
programs. especially through rural coammunities to whom the State wil:
prowide the necessavy plantinS materials and tchnaical assistance.
48.  In order to onsue successful iWplemetation of this program, the
G9wvetnmt inteads to strengthen the Forest and Water lesoucces Department and
to that end will conduct a management audit of SODEFOR, which will be
reorganized if necessary in a manner consistent with these new forest policy
objectives.
Wood, Erg2gsinE and Harketia.
40. The- Government will also begin a eforam of the tax regulations governing
the processing and marketing of timber, its aim being to enhance the asset val_-e
of these resources. As of 1990, the present lumber export quota system will be
abolished. An in-depth study will be undertaken to ensure that the new taxati.cn
system achieves the following objectives:
-    efficient and cost-effective operations in the sector;
-    flexibility and effectiveness of the system as a vehicle for
implemonting government policy on remuneration for access to nationa:,
public or private forest resources, their conservation and enhancame:
of tkeir value.
This new system will come into effect beginning in mid-1990.
EnvironMental Protection
50. The Government proposes to take the following environmental protection
measuress
-    physical demareation of the national parks, with priority assigned t-
La Marahoud, Tal and Le Banco:
-    continue the work of developing La Camoe Park;
-    fomAulate and launch a scientific and tourist development program fo:
each park:



87
Appendix 1
Page 14 of 20
-    outline a national water tesource management policy;
_    draw up a national program  for the protection and management of
watershed areas that includes specific measures for soil conservation
and restoration.
The total cost to the Governmaent of financing these programs is estimated at
CIAP 12 billion per annum.
YUS. M        _AJOR MaC!  2_ SOME= AMON
51. To provide the necessary back-up for its policy of recovery, privatization
and modernization in the agricultural *ectc_, the Government will concentrate
its action on five major areas: agricultural credit, farmland developmat,
mechanization, orgauization and training of smallholders, and agricultural
research.
Aaricultural Credit
S2. So far, financing of the rural sector has been essentially a matter of
public investment..and farmer self-financing; the banking sector still plays on;.:
a marginal role. Governent resources (anAual budgets, grant funds, external
borroving3 are ,clearly declining in volume and this is reflected in the record
of public investment in agriculture: CIAF 970/billion in the years 1976-1980,
CFA? 395/billion in 1981-1985, and CIA? 360/billion projected for the 1986-.99.
Plan (at constant 1985 prices).   Smallholder resources (savings and informal
credit) appear to be significant according to the diagnostic stocktaking
recently completed by the Government. Although these resources continue to be
wobilized effectively through informal channels, organized entities such as t!ie
CUPs (Caisses Rurales d'Epargue et de Prets) and the GYCs (Groupements a
Vocation Cooperative) are expanding =ad demonstrating their capacity to play a..
increasingly important role.
53. The new agricultural credit policy will tap into this potential and the
following measures will be taken to achieve an optimal level of organization &=-
effectiveness during an *assisted developmentt of these structures:
_    a single. permanent credit agency will be established on the
foundations of the present Direction de ia Mutualite et de ia
Coopdration of the Ministry of Agriculture but it will have manageria 3
autonomy and be less bureaucratic and more action-oriented;
_    the agency will be lsan both as to its organization and number of
staff, although the latter will be highly qualified;
its goald and strategies will be clearly and rigorously defined, and
adequate, permanent and readily accessible financial resources will 'a
allocated to it.



88
Appendix 1
Page 15 of 20
54.  The modern bankia sy1stem still plays only a small part in finane. ng the
rural sector. The goal of channeling 5.3Z of all modern-type credits made (i.e.
approuimately ClAP 40 billion) to the primary sector has not been achieved.
Since the commercial banks are no more tha a marginal actor, financing of
agriculture has in fact fallen mainly on BUDA. This agency, however, has had
very serious  ifficulties in recent years which severely comromised its chances
of surwival.
5..  The Govnment is comitted to the financial restructuring of BNDA and its
continued activity. Neasres have already been taken to clear its deficit.
This finacial rehabilitation progra will be completed by the end of 1989. on
September 16. 1987, a finacial restructuring plan for BNDA was adopted and an
institutional model selected to help BIDA take on a broader mandate and enable
it to tfin e agricultural production. marketing and processing.  Various
complementary measares have also been decided upons
(a)  makinsg I 's links to its institutional and finacial
environment (public and other shareholders, extension agencies,
clients) transparent;
(b) creation in 1989 of a second window for the operations which BNC.;.
will undertake for and on account of the State and which involve
an unacceptable degree of risk in the opinion of BNDA; this will.
be covered by. resources made available to BNDA by the Gover%ment:
its remmeration for such services will enable it to cover its
operating costs, and will be based partly on performance
criteria;
Cc) establishment of a partnership or management assistance
relationship with an external banking institution:
(d) anagement rationalization as part of the reorganization process
ad provision of personnel training;
(e) adoption by the Government of a general policy statement linking
together all the parts of the program.
Farmland Develouuzet
56. The rapid modernization of agriculture and the substantial investment
effort being made by both the authorities and farmers themselves need to be
accompanied by major innovations in land tenure. In order to facilitate change
of this type and give farme;s greater security of tenure, the Government will.
lay the foundations for a National Land Use Plan which not only takes account Oc
the requirements of the major sector programs involving the use of rural land
but is a1so carefully tailored to their aims.
57. At present, only 2: of annually cultivated land is normally accessible to.
and developed for, mechanized farming The Government's move to develop
additional farmland will follow four clearly defined lines of action:



89
Appendix I
Page 16 of 20
-    laying the foundations for-. new f-i and tenure policy to be based c-
the formulation of land use plans.
providg deloped land sutable for mechanized farming;
-    encoraging the settlemat of young famers on bottomlands which,
although difficult to deelop, are ideal for rice-growing,
particularly in tlw forest zone but also in urban periphery areas,
within the cotezt of local integated rural developmat projects;
creating a basic network of cru    access -roads so that increased
agricultural products can be brought to market and the heavier inputs.
whose use the Goerment wishes to develop, delivered.
I   '.IficatiOn of  gotential Farmland
58. In ordr to ensre that the nm land use policy is a tound one and that the
masoues taken allow for existing natural constraints, it is proposed to go
aead with two complemetary actions that will provide fuller knowledge of the
present land occupancy pattern:
-    a national remote-sensing program to obtain a census of current types
of land use and of the production potential that could be tapped into
by developing areas which are presently devalued by overextensive use:
3    a pilot program to obtain a census of available land areas and to draw
up rral landholding maps so as to identify more accurately
appropriate implemntation methods and costs of a national program of
this type.
Farln Develo_ et Proeram
59. Nation-wide, approximately 800,000 ha are cleared every year of which abou:
600,000 ha is old fallow land. Over and above the support it already provides
for manual clearing operations with the use of winches .in the savanna zone
(10.000 ha per year), the Government proposes to implement new programs of
farmland development.
60. If the agricultural development corporations are to be able to accomplish
the increased agricultural production and modernization goals set for them, a
total of 50,000 ha of agricultural land will have to be developed (stumping and
access) in the space of five years. The breakdown of requirements is as
folloss: 4,000 ha per year for maechanized farming on savanna plateau lands and
6,000 ha per year of bottomlands suited to rice-growing (2.000 ha in the savanna
zone, 6,000 ha in the forest zone).  The cost of this program. not including ths
participation of beneficiary smallholders, is estimated at CIAF 5 billion per
annum.
Irrizatiou. The Governitn's first priority is to rehabilitate existing
irrigated areas and improv their performance. New developmeat will mainly be a
matter of irrigating bottozlands with direct offtake from a natural stream.

aural Roads.
61.  Despite the achiOvemet represented by the extension and maintenace of ti'.
rural road network (50.400 km), a now tpe of bottlemeck has developed between
villages where collection markets are located and temporary settlements adjacen:
to production areas. Progress with the intensification and mechaniztion of
agriculture Is also limLted by the lack of vehicle access to farm, this is
particularly marked in the forest zone.
62.  Systematic serviciug of the 3 milion ha eamarked for cash crops
cultivation wuld require an eastimated 300,000 km of rural roads. Having
followed a careful planning process, the Goveriwent has now adopted the goal of
creating 100,000 km of  ural rods, of two dtffecout categories, over a
fivQ-ytar pe.1.od.     .
-agesor yI rgoads:s  Thes would be built throughout C8te d'lvoire's
agricultual districts to provide access to otherwise isolated
temporary settlements. An initial 50.000 km will be brought
into service at the rate of 10,000 km a year. The coSt to the State
is estimated at CPAW 5 billion annually in capital costs and CFAF 1.7
billion in annual maintenance costs by the end of the program period.
3 atesorv 2 roads:  These would be farm access roads.  Although this
network, which will feed into the first and eventually be three times
as extensive, initially only 50,000 km would be conastructed.
concentrated in priority districts where farm output is high. At a
rate of 10.000 km a year the cost to the State would be CFAF 1.5
billion in capital costs per year. Maintenance would be the
responsibility of the farmers thesmselves.
In both cases, subsequent continued maintenance and repair over the entire
network of rural roads could not be undertaken by the State: it would be the
responsibility of the local beneficiary farming communities.
e Role of MOAG
63. The State can call on a specialized agency, KOTORACRI. to implemet these
farmland development progrms. Its capacity has been ander-utilized so far.
since it has never been systematically oriented toward priority tasks, given ar.-
clear program, or subjected to oversight and review.
64. The proposed road building program is very scattered. It therefore lends
itself not so muCh to costly preliminary studies as to simultaneous pilot
projects involving both study and implementation. The force account method
alone is suited to the necessarily contingent and not easily quantifiable natur.
of these projects, and only careful monitoring of this method can ensure that
rates of return and costs can be kept in line with private sector levels.
65. With very low marginal costs (prior definition of goals, performnoce
monitoring, and purchase of ten graders) it will be possible to multiply



91
Appendix 1
Page 18 of 20
TO?OgAG' s output three or four tims.  The agene: * existing large pbysical
and hum   capital endowment would be sufficient foz it to carry out the proposec
program effectively. MOTOORA will be completely reorganized and given the
primay responsibUlty for excuting a progrm to opea up and maintain rural
roads  nd dwelop agricultural land. It will be equipped with a carefully
desip*d analytical accounting system to enable It to determine the real cost o.
its operations, and will be allowd to compte in public competitive bidding
procedures for cerain goverament contracts on the se  basis as private-sector
companies.
66. All agricultural dvelopmt projects coe  up against the problem of the
inefficient use of agricultural mapoer, with the result that although yields
per hectare rise, Income per day of work stagnates. Considerable progress has
already been mad  in C6te d'Zvoirs with mechaization, but it
passes unnoticed, either because it is unpectacular (ultra-low-volume
applications of chemicals) or because it is beyond the reach of the average
sallholder (mechanical land clearing, agro-industrial operations, industrial
hulling, oec.).
67. It has now become necessary to promote mechanization at the smallholder
leel, particularly in soil preparation, crop care and harvesting (tasks that
present specal d_4ffLc;lties in the savanna zone).  Different types of
maechasation and motorization have been sufficiently well-tested to enable
larger-scale operations with State support.   The programs proposed will be
adjusted as required to met regional constraints of which the development
agencies are owae and with the level of technical sophistication already
reached by the farming operation to be mechanized.
68. Throughout the forest zone. where the plantation-type of economy is very
vigorous, govenment support will mainly take the fom of measures to alleviats
purchase and maintenance costs thouglh reduction of the taxes on imported
machinery, spare parts and fuel. These programs will also benefit from the neo-
easures proposed for the financing of agricultural investmuet and farmland
development.
69. In the savaa zone, oan the other haud, projects of a specific nature wiJl:
be undertaken. In addition to the tax relief and farmland development measures
referred to above, the State will take all necessary steps to see that
beneficiary smliholders have access to the logistical support necessary for
adequate equipment maintenance and to the right kind of management assistance.
The medium-term program for mechanization in the savanna zone calls for the
creation over a five-year period of 9,500 farms dependent on animal traction aa-
1,000 mechanized farms, occupying altogether over 80,000 ha. Clearing
operations apart, the cost to the State of this program is estimated at CFAF 5
billiln per aunu, including the fiancing of smallholder credit facilities,
especially for the purchase of farm machinery.

Smalllioder Organization and Training
70.  in the Light of.GoverMnt's economic deregulation and revitalization plaar
and in accordance with the goal of gradual withdrawal by the State from the
agricultural production system. the Governmet intends to prmote agricultural
professional origaizations and bcoaden their respoaibility for agricultural
dvelopmnt.  Two major lines of action will be followeds
(a) Reinforcement of the rural cooperative movement, which serves as the
foundation for reorganiztion of the agricultural enviroment and is
espocted to take ovr the State's activities in smaliholder farming.
The Goveuament is La the course of preparing a series of amendments ts
the body of regulations now governing cooperatives.
(b) Creation, in the most developed productive sectors, of professional oa
interprofessional entities to be responsible for the their
administration. This is already being done with export fruit crops
CSUB) and rubber (APROZAC) and is about to be done in the oil palm
subsector. A national progrma for development of the rural
cooperative movement will be instituted, first of all to unify aad
reonforce the extnsion function and broaden the ecoodmic and
finaicial base from which the cooperatives operate. and secondly to
bring about transfer management and supervision to the movement
itself.
71. In addition, given the present n&tional policy on education and vocationa.
training, Ivorian agriculture will be able to count on a labor force that is
increasingly well-qualified and competent. Over and above the basic extension
services that have been provided for a long time already by the regional
development corporations and are now being reactivated through the
training-and-visit project, the Government will make available to the
agricultural world as a wholes
-    better-qualified advisers who are capable of understanding all facets
of a farming oneration and of providing specific management advise to
the operators of new small- and medium-sized agricultural enterprises;
-    earmarked funds to establish young people who have completed their
schooling--preferably those who came originally from a rural
environmAnt--and who wish to make their living as farmers; the goal
for the medium term is to initiate and supervise tho start-up of 5.ooC
young people annually in all types of farring operation.
-    an agricultural vocational training system that is to be revitalized
and strengthened at the top by creation of a new institute for
advanced agricultural studies (ENSA, Ecole Nationale Supdrieure
Agronomique) at Yamoussoukro and at the lower levels of the general
education system by primary and secondary school curricula that give
more emphasis to the elements of agriculture so that young school
leavers can take their places more rapidly in the country's
agricultural production system; the medium-term goal here is to
respond to the growing needs of the private agricultural sector as
well as those of its public counterpart.

72. Cote d4voZire's existing national research poteLtial and the quality of the
results obtainsed so far are fully co_mensurate vith its current effort to
modernize its agriculture. Tn order to sustain this effort and reinforce the
foundations on which agricultural structural adjustment rests, the Government
will continue its comitment to agronomic research and vill emphasize the
following objectives:
(a) continuing the present research programs on perennial and export
crops, especially thoso that are the focus of development projects;
(b) strengthening current research programs on both food and livestock
products, particularly as fac as selection of production techniques z
concerned:
(c)  Increasing the resources allocated to applied research and orient su:
programs to identified needs.
