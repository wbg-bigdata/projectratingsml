                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track towards achieving its Project Development Objective (PDO). As of May 15, 2013 4.75 million urban and rural residents have been provided with access to
                         improved water supply and sanitation services from the project intervention. This is 95%of the restructured project end target. The original project targeted to serve 1.8 million rural
                         and 1 million urban populations through the construction of 4125- rural schemes in 204 Woredas and improving water supply and sanitation in 50 towns. However following GB£ 66
                         million additional resource is obtained in 2008 through a MDTF financed by DFID the number of beneficiaries from were increased to 3.7 million and 1.33 million for rural and urban
                         beneficiaries respectively.

                         Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS): Implementation of the rural component is almost complete except for a few ongoing rural piped systems, which are expected to be
                         completed before project closing date. So far from the joint DFID-IDA support, 3.85 million rural people have benefited from improved water supply services through capacity building
                         in 224 Woredas and construction of 9,548 rural water supply schemes . All households benefiting from new water supply schemes financed by the WSSP have been covered by
                         complementary awareness creation interventions on the benefits of constructing house hold latrine and healthy hygienic practices. However, reporting on the physical activities as

                         well as on fund utilized by education and health sectors has not been adequate. Cumulative data on hygiene and Sanitation interventions financed by the project is not compiled both
                         in terms of coverage (only few regions reported), intervention types (only institutional latrine is reported )

                         Urban Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS): In terms of the urban component, so far about 900,000 urban residents have obtained access to improved water supply services from
                         increased production through “Immediate Service Improvement? interventions. Progress in the remaining towns is at an advanced stage of completion with supply and installation of
                         electro mechanical equipment, supply of large DCI pipes and connection to the national power grid remaining in some towns.

                         So far cumulative disbursement from all sources has reached US$ 272.8 million, which is 98% of the total revised allocation (US$ 278.2 million) of which US$214 million was spent
                         and documented. The remaining unsettled balance (US$ 60.8 million) is the balance in the regions either in cash or in document or in the form of advance at all levels (amount
                         transferred but not settled). Regions and implementing agencies with large amount of unsettled balance include Oromiya, Tigray, Somali and MoWE. Federal and regional project
                         implementing bodies have been advised (i) to speed up approval of payment requests and to timely effect payments, (ii) to timely report expenditures for executed and certified
                         deliverables, and (iii) encourage contractors and suppliers to timely submit their payment requests. This has resulted in improved utilization and documentation of advances. About
                         US$ 41 million has been spent and reported during the last two quarters alone.

                         The project has almost achieved its development objectives with effective and efficient implementation modalities. The project implementation modalities upon which choice of
                         affordable technology is ensured in consultation with communities and based on their willingness and ability to pay tariffs and user charges, as well as specific economic analysis of
                         each proposed sub-project for town water supply before implementation made the project efficient. The financial and economic analysis conducted during the appraisal of the
                         additional financing has estimated that at 10.2% discount rate and over 15 years the economic internal rate of return for the project is 27.4% and its NPV is ETB 58.5 million. So far
                         the project spent about US$ 273 million and provided access to about 4.75 million beneficiaries through the construction and rehabilitation of 9,548 rural water supply schemes and
                         completion of 41 town water supply schemes. The unit cost per beneficiary is about US$ 57. While this is significantly higher than the initial estimate at 2004 (for hand dug well US$
                         15, for Borehole US$29, for RPS US$20 and for town US$ 32), it is relatively fair compared to the average per capita cost for Africa which ranges from US$ 20 to US$ 90.In
                         preparation for investment on physical infrastructure, the project has spent significant time and resource on various capacity building interventions, which narrowed the capacity gap
                         identified during project design among both public and private stakeholders at all levels. An assessment of the project's various capacity building interventions was conducted by
                         independent consultants, which stated that "The capacity building approach of the WSSP, i.e. learning by doing, the stepped approach and the tripartite arrangement (with
                         government, private sector and users) is assessed to be relevant and coherent with the overall WASH sector policies, strategies and priorities".

                         The approach has also contributed for the realization of Government's policies of decentralization of resources management to the lowest level, promoting the involvement of all
                         stakeholders in service delivery, enhancing community ownership, improving level of cost recovery, and integration of hygiene and s anitation and water supply.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is on track to meet its development objective. To enable the completion of the remaining tasks the project closing date has been extended by six months to October 10,
                         2013. Implementing agencies at all levels are enhancing their supervision to bring to closure the remaining few activities including the commissioning and proper handing over to the
                         utilities / communities. Ensuring sustainability of schemes remains to be a major challenge with implications beyond the current project indicating the need for future interventions to
                         consider strengthening Operation and Maintenance systems. Both the Borrower and the Bank have initiated to prepare Implementation Completion Report (ICR). In this regard the
                         client has agreed to complete the procurement process and deploy the consultants by June 20, 2013.
