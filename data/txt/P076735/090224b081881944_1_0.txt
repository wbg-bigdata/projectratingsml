                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track towards achieving its PDO. Implementation of the rural component was substantially completed in most of the regions except in Somali where performance is
                         only 41% of the target. So far from the joint DFID-IDA support 3.3 million rural people have benefited from improved water supply services through capacity building in 224 woredas
                         and construction of 8,674 rural water supply schemes. Since the last ISR, 1,244 new rural water supply schemes have been constructed.
                         The total number of rural water supply schemes constructed is about 90% of the overall plan for the project. However, when the achievements are examined by types of schemes the
                         progress in the construction of larger schemes: Rural Piped Systems (RPS) from springs 77%, RPS from deep wells 39% are found to be relatively low when compared to small
                         schemes (both HDWs and on spot spring are over 90%).

                         Hence there is a need to strengthen support and follow up to Somali which is lagging behind the others, speed up implementation of large schemes and continued refresher training
                         and capacity building interventions.
                         There is significant improvement in the implementation of Hygiene and Sanitation intervention. However, lack of regular and proper reporting on the physical activities as well as on

                         fund utilized by education and health sectors is a persistent concern. The report on hygiene and Sanitation interventions financed by the project is not complete both in terms of
                         coverage (only few regions reported), intervention types (only institutional latrine is reported) and the cumulative report on physical activities since the start of the project needs to be
                         consolidated.

                         In terms of the urban component, about 524,000 urban residents have obtained access to improved water supply services from increased production through “Immediate Service
                         Improvement? interventions in 79 program towns, construction of water supply system in 13 small (two of which were completed after the last ISR) and one sub-loan towns is
                         completed. The remaining 62 towns are at various stage of implementation (25 above 70%; 5 between 50% and 60%; 21 below 50%, and the last 21 at early stage of contracting).
                         The performance of local operators in distribution and enhanced services in these towns has also improved.

                         So far the project has disbursed about US$ 207 million which is 76% of the total resource allocated for the project from all sources (IDA credit and Grant as well as Trust fund). The
                         project is expected to disburse USD 66 million within the remaining six months before project closing. Moreover a total of US$ 55 million that has been disbursed needs to be settled
                         and reported. However the rate of disbursement is very slow compared to the fast approaching project closing date. Hence, in addition to improving physical progress, federal and
                         regional PMUs have: (i) to speed up the approval and effecting payment for executed works/ delivered services and goods; (ii) timely report expenditures for executed and certified
                         deliverables etc. and (iii) encourage contractors to timely submit their payment request.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         It was agreed that strengthening and sustaining the capacity created at all levels and ensuring quality and sustainability of the physical infrastructures constructed will be the focus for
                         the remaining period of the project. It is also agreed to critically review status and work schedule for town water supply and sanitation contractors and to further intensify the follow-up
                         and implementation support with special focus on (i) critical towns with slow progress and high potential for further delay; (ii) project activities that are critical for project completion,
                         such as supply of electro mechanical equipment and fittings for large diameter pipes; and (iii) slow/none performing contractors, particularly those that are engaged in multiple and
                         large value contracts as well as (iv) Somali region whose performance is lagging behind the rest of the regions.
