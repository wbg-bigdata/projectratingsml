                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is on track towards achieving its Project Development Objective (PDO). As of August 31, 2013 a total of 5.1 million urban and rural residents have been provided with
                         access to improved water supply and sanitation services from the project intervention. This is 102 % of the restructured project end target. The original project targeted was to serve
                         1.8 million rural and 1 million urban populations through the construction of 4125- rural schemes in 204 Woredas and improving water supply and sanitation in 50 towns. However
                         following GB£ 66 million additional resource obtained in 2008 through a MDTF financed by DFID the numbers of beneficiaries were increased to 3.7 million and 1.33 million for rural
                         and urban beneficiaries respectively, bringing the total number of planned beneficiaries to 5 million.

                         Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS): Implementation of the rural component is complete except for a few rural piped systems that are at the final inspection and testing stage
                         expected to be completed before project closing date. So far from the joint DFID-IDA support, 4.21 million rural people have benefited from improved water supply services through
                         capacity building in 224 Woredas and construction of 9,801 (100.3 % of the original target) rural water supply schemes. All households benefiting from new water supply schemes
                         financed by the WSSP have been covered by complementary awareness creation interventions on the benefits of constructing house hold latrine and healthy hygienic practices. Fund

                         utilization reporting by education and health sectors is not adequate. During the period it is also reported a cumulative beneficiary number of more than 287,900 benefiting from
                         improved institutional latrines (those constructed as demonstration latrines and the latrines constructed in Health and education facilities). This component was made possible in
                         conjunction with a robust capacity building arrangement that helped the establishment of more than 224 Woreda WaSH teams in 224 woredas that prepared and executed a woreda
                         wide WaSH plans. The establishment and deployment of more than 36 Wroeda support Groups and 400 community facilitation teams provided a much needed support for woredas
                         to prepare their WaSH plan and implement it and for communities to prepare and realize their facilitates management plans. The training and deployment of more than 2600 local
                         artisans under the project was also a major capacity building activity that helped to realize the targets set under this component. The recognition, organization and strengthening of
                         the Woreda WaSH sector Offices is an important step for bringing the service closer to the beneficiaries. However, compared to their responsibility the woreda offices were
                         strengthened with the necessary resources (human, financial and material). At the community level community Wash Committees are established. WaSHCOs manage the provision
                         of water supply to rural communities and participate in scheme development and its operation and maintenance. All the WaSH Committee has at least 35% women and almost all the
                         treasures of these committees are women. The project has further laid the foundation for sector harmonization; its implementation model has been adopted by the government for the
                         formulation of the Universal access Plan (UAP) and WaSH Implementation Framework (WIF). Moreover the approach and support system has been effectively replicated by other
                         donor financed interventions such as AfDB.

                         Urban Water Supply and Sanitation (UWSS): Under this component, so far about 900,000 urban residents have obtained access to improved water supply services from increased
                         production through “Immediate Service Improvement? interventions as well as through expansion of water supply systems. Progress is at an advanced stage of completion with
                         installation of electro mechanical equipment, and connection to the national power grid remaining in some towns. Similarly under this component, the establishment and deployment
                         of more than 17 town support groups (a team of 4 individual consultants from different Field of specialization working as one group) provided a critical support for program towns in
                         training board members and utility operators, prepare business plans, prepare study and deign documents and bid processing and other forms of support. At the start of projects
                         towns in the country were at a wide spectrum of management models (from those managed by Committee similar to rural schemes to much bigger towns that have utility and board
                         arrangement.) The project supported towns in a step by step way to improve service levels (that includes integrated sanitation plan) to allow them expand their revenue base, improve
                         efficiency by au tomating bill collection, reduce an accounted for water and training both the utility staff and board members, support the preparation of a medium and long term
                         business plan. This will help towns to reach gradually the highest anticipated stage under the governments Urban water supply and Sanitation policy, that is to be able to access
                         commercial finance that will allow them improve service levels. The approach has been quickly picked up by the government and reflected in a number of policy documents Universal
                         access Plan (UAP), one WaSH National Program (OWNP). It is encouraging to see a number of towns outside the project, deploying consultants from their own financing for the
                         preparation of business plan, and boards and utilities signing performance contracts. The intervention thorough this project is being instrumental for shifting sector support from a
                         centralized supply-driven approach to identifying, financing and implementing water supply and sanitation projects to a demand driven approach, whereby communities and Town
                         Water Boards will receive investment support only after demonstrating ownership and capacity to plan, implement and manage their water supply and sanitation schemes. The
                         approach contributed for the realization of Government's policies of decentralization of resources management to the lowest level, promoting the involvement of all stakeholders in
                         service delivery, enhancing community ownership, improving level of cost recovery, and integration of hygiene and sanitation and water supply.

                         Disbursement: Out of SDR 119.2 million original allocation from all IDA sources (IDA 3901-ET, IDA H085-ET and IDA 4713_ET) SDR 8.28 million was canceled from the project and

                         reallocated in responses to global food crises. Out of the revised allocation of SDR 110.9 million so far SDR 107.8 million was disbursed which is 97% of the revised allocation. Out
                         of UK£ 70 million originally allocated from DFID for the MDTF T UK£ 4 million was reallocated to other sectors. The remaining UK£ 66 million (equivalent to US$ 106, 788, 427) was
                         subsequently transferred to the MDTF account in seven rounds and fully disbursed to implementing agencies. Hence so far (As of August 29, 2013) cumulative disbursement from all
                         sources (for IDA sources reckoned @ 1SDR= 1.5206 US$) has reached US$ 270.5 million, which is 98% of the total revised allocation (US$ 275.5 million) of which US$227.2 million
                         was spent and documented. The remaining unsettled balance (US$ 43.5 million) is the balance in the regions either in cash or in document or in the form of advance at all levels
                         (amount transferred but not settled). Moreover there is US $4.6 Million that needs to be disbursed to the designated account. The progress in reducing the unsettled balance of US
                         $43 Million by the official project closing date (October 10, 2013) will determine the possibility of disbursing this remaining US $4.6 Million to the designated account. Currently
                         Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MoFED) and Ministry of Water and Energy (MWE) have deployed teams to all the nine regions to finalize the settlement and
                         documentation of the remaining outstanding balance.

                         The project has followed effective and efficient implementation modalities upon which choice of affordable technology is ensured in consultation with communities and based on their

                         willingness and ability to pay tariffs and user charges, as well as specific economic analysis of each proposed sub-project for town water supply before implementation made the
                         project efficient. As indicated in the PAD, the financial and economic analysis conducted during the appraisal of the project has estimated that at 10% discount rate and over 15 years
                         the economic internal rate of return for the project is 20.6% and its NPV is US$24.19 million. The sensitivity analysis shows that the project provides an acceptable economic rate of
                         return (12.2%) even at 25% cost increase. So far the project spent about US$ 270.5 million and provided access to about 5.1 million beneficiaries through the construction and

                         rehabilitation of 9,801 rural water supply schemes and completion of 41 town water supply schemes. The average unit cost per beneficiary is about US$ 53. While this is significantly
                         higher than the initial estimate at 2004 (US$ 15-29 for rural beneficiaries and US$ 32 for urban beneficiaries, it is relatively fair compared to the average per capita cost for Africa
                         which ranges from US$ 20 to US$ 90. Though the economic and financial returns of the project have not been reevaluated at the end, the increase in cost per beneficiary will not
                         affect economic viability of the project. The sensitivity analysis conducted t appraisal shows that the project provides an acceptable economic rate of return (12.2%) even at 25% cost
                         increase. In addition the amount of benefit accruing from improved water supply and sanitation is expected to increase due to the rise in the value of some parameters used to
                         calculate the economic benefits (minimum wage from ETB 200 to ETB 420 per capita and health expenditure from US$ 5 to US$ 16). In preparation for investment on physical
                         infrastructure, the project has spent significant time and resource on various capacity building interventions, which narrowed the capacity gap identified during project design among
                         both public and private stakeholders at all levels. An assessment of the project's various capacity building interventions was conducted by independent consultants, which stated that
                         "The capacity building approach of the WSSP, i.e. learning by doing, the stepped approach and the tripartite arrangement (with government, private sector and users) is assessed to
                         be relevant and coherent with the overall WaSH sector policies, strategies and priorities".

                         The approach has also contributed for the realization of Government's policies of decentralization of resources management to the lowest level, promoting the involvement of all
                         stakeholders in service delivery, enhancing community ownership, improving level of cost recovery, and integration of hygiene and sanitation and water supply.

                         2013. Implementing agencies at all levels are enhancing their supervision to bring to closure the remaining few activities including the commissioning and proper handing over to the
                         utilities / communities. Ensuring sustainability of schemes remains to be a major challenge with implications beyond the current project indicating the need for future interventions to
                         consider strengthening Operation and Maintenance systems. Currently the government is in the process of deploying consultants to conduct Implementation Completion Report
                         based on a Terms of Reference cleared by the Bank.
