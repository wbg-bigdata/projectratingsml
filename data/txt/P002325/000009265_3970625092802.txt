MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
FOR A
PRIMARY EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT OPERATION
1.        The folloving report on a proposed development credit to the Republic
of Senegal for SDR 10.2 million (US$12.0 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval. The proposed credit would be on standard TDA terms and vould assist
in financing an operation which, vithin the framework of the Goverrmentts
structural and sectoral adjustment programs, would help improve the cost-
effectiveness of education resources and strengthen the institutions
responsible for education quality and resource management.
2.        Background.  Despite considerable progress in expanding education
since Senegal's independence, the relationship between results achieved and
resources deployed has been uneven. In 1984, adult literacy and primary school
enrollments vere below the median for West Africa: 28% versus 34%, and 52%
versus 66%, respectively. In the same year, education consumed 25% of the
Government's recurrent budget and the per student cost in primary education vas
the fourth highest in West Africa: US$114, compared to the regional average of
US$84. Recognizing that a broader base of literacy and numeracy is an
essential condition for sustained socio-economic development, the Government
aims to achieve universal primary education by the year 2000. To advance
towards this goal, the Government vill need to reallocate resources within the
sector and significantly improve the efficiency of resource use.
3.        The two major factors that impede the development of primary educa-
tion are the relatively high cost of its main inputs and anomalies of resource
allocation in the sector. At the primary level, high teacher salaries, low
student/teacher ratios in rural areas, excessive administrative staff/teacher
ratios, and high classroom construction costs, due to reliance on imported
materials and inappropriate designs, contribute to the high unit costs.
Another factor in the high cost is the low internal efficiency resulting from:
(a) inadequate teaching skills and unduly academic curricula; (b) an inspector-
ate staff who lack the physical means to conduct school visits, up-to-date
knovledge of classroom techniques and authority to impose sanctions for un-
satisfactory teacher performances; (c) shortages of relevant textbooks and
teacher guides; and (d) inadequate classrooms and furniture. At the post-
secondary level, equity and efficiency issues stand out. In 1985, 19% of the
education budget was consumed by 2% of the higher education age group. Of
special concern are the size and avard of fellovships and subsidies for student
services, whereby criteria such as academic performance, labor market require-
ments, and cost efficiency are not always applied. Righer education also has
low internal efficiency: only one out of five students graduates,'and on
average it takes 7-12 years to complete the four-year-cycle. Low student!
teacner ratios at civil service training schools resulting from constrained
public service hiring further contribute to the high unit costs as do the
technical weakness of the central, regional and local institutions in resource
management and quality improvement.

4.        Objectives of the Operation.  The overall objective is to assist the
Government, vithin the framevork of its structural adjustment program, to
accelerate the qualitative and quantitative development of primary education.
To this end, the operation vould help: (a) support a phased sectoral adjust-
ment program; (b) develop the planning, budgeting and cost-control capacitv of
the Ministry of National Education; and (c) improve teacher effectiveness, the
efficiency of primary school inspectors, and the relevance and availability of
textbocks.
5.        Description of the Operation.  The operation, to be implemented over
an eight-year period, vould foecus on the regions of Louga, Diourbel and Fatick.
These three regions comprise 25% of the total population and have the lowest
primary enrollment rates (an average of 33% compared to 54% for Senegal). The
operation vould support measures aimed at lowering unit costs by improving the
efficiency of resource use and at expanding primary education, vithout
additional public resources, by restructuring intrasectoral budget allocations.
At the primary level, the main features of this adjustment program are to:
(a) increase the ratio of associate teachers ("instituteurs adjoints") to more
highly paid teachers ("instituteurs") from about 1:1 to 4:1 as of the 1986/87
school year; (b) redeploy into primary classrooms 400 primary school teachers
presently in administrative posts (200 during 1986/87 and 1987/88, and the
remaining 200 during 1988/89 and 1989/90); and (c) introduce multigrade and
double-shift systems in appropriate classrooms nationvide as of 1989/90. At
the post-primary level, the program includes measures aimed at reducing ineffi-
ciencies to contain expenditures vithout adversely affecting quality and equity
of education, and at reallocating the funds thus made available to primary edu-
cation. Specifically, these measures consist of: (a) reduction of the
fellovship budget in real terms from its 1985/86 level by 8% in 1987/88 and
3.0% p.a. thereafter through 1994/95; (b) reduction of indirect subsidies to
University of Dakar Campus Services in real terms from the 1985/86 level by 8%
p.a. as of 1987/88 through 1994/95; (c) introduction of cost-recovery systems,
including student loans; (d) consolidating specialized civil service schools to
increase student/teacher ratios to be agreed with IDA following a study to be
conducted in 1987, and doubling the student/teacher ratio in teacher training
colleges by 1988/89; and (e) establishing ceilings in real terms on the annual
budgetary growth rates of central administration (1% p.a.), secondary education
(1.5% p.a.), and higher education (1% p.a.) between 1987/88 and 1993194.
6.        In order to minimize primary school replacement needs and reduce
construction costs through improved planning and budgeting, the operation would
create a Physical Facility Management Division; rehabilitate 100 classrooms;
establish a preventive maintenance system and train the staff of all primary
schools to ensure regular upkeep of facilities.  Additionally, the operation
would help construct 400 low-cost/low-maintenance classrooms, using local
desigus. materials and labor, under cost-sharing arrangements with the com-
munities. The internal efficiency and relevance of primary education would be
lmproved through better-focused teacher training; development of curricula
relevant to national needs, combined with teacher and school administration
support and improved resource management at the regional and local levels; and
development of a textbook production, procurement and distribution capability.
Further, the operation would strengthen the cipacity of the Directorate of
Studies, Human Resources and Planning to maintain reduced unit costs, implement
long-tern  sectoral planning and carrv out the necessary resource allocations
within the sector.



- 3 -
7.        The total cost of the operation is estimated at US$19.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$12.2 million (62%). The
operation would be cofinanced by the African Development Bank. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule, are given
in Schedule B.  A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Senegal are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  The
map showing the project locations is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6179-SE dated September 9, 1986, is being distributed separately.
8.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's sector strategy suppcrts the
high priority given by the Government to its educational reform efforc, whose
basic objectives are to create an education system that is equitable, efficient
and responsive to national needs. Three major goals are: (a) expanding access
to primary education and improving its quality and relevance; (b) strengthening
the institutional structure; and (c) using existing human and physical
resources more efficiently. This would be the first Bank Group financed edu-
cation operation in Senegal in support of the educational reform. It addresses
the needs of the first phase of a full-scale adjustment program that would re-
structure education financing and develop cost control mechanisms. In this
context, the operation falls within the objectives of the Government's
structural adjustment program as vell as of the second IDA structural
adjustment credit.
9.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to assess, jointly with
IDA, progress in implementing the proposed adjustment measures during two
reviews whose timing would be linked to the second and third phases of the
classroom construction component. A condition of disbursement for these phases
would be realization of satisfactory progress in implementing these adjustment
measures, in accordance with criteria already agreed with IDA. These criteria
include achievement of the targets and measures outlined in paragraphs 5 and 6
above. The Government has also agreed to: (a) carry out studies on planning
and financing primary education and improving the quality and cost efficiency
of secondary and higher education, and implement their recommendations as
agreed with IDA; (b) make available at least 15% of its annual school repairs
budget for primary school rehabilitation; (c) appoint and maintain staff re-
sponsible for implementing the project in adequate numbers and with qualifi-
cations acceptable to IDA; (d) develop and discuss vith IDA a preventive school
maintenance program by June 30, 1988, and thereafter assign responsibility for
implementation to teachers and headmasters; (e) prepare and implement annual
local and overseas training programs and award the fellowships on the basis of
criteria agreed with IDA, and appoint the fellowship recipients to posts com-
mensurate with their training; and (f) to the extent practicable, use local
materials, designs and maintenance methods for the classrooms to be
constructed.
10.       Justification.  The operation would improve access to primary educa-
tior. nationwide. Through the application of adjustment policy measures,
enrollments are expected to increase by about 321 (180,000 additional students)
by the 1994/95 school year without increasing the share of education in the
Government budget from its 1985/86 level. The classroom construction program
would help reduce construction costs by about 35%, provide replicable classroom
designs, and set the pattern for cost sharing by communities. The operation
would also improve the quality of primary education through the provision of



-4-
textbooks, development of revised curricula, and teacher upgrading programs.
Support to institution building would yield the long-term benefit of improved
education planning, budgeting and resource management capacities.
11.       Risks.  The operation has two potential risks.  First, adjustment
measures such as reducing higher education subsidies or introducing the double-
shift system may not be fully endorsed by teachers, students or parents.  Aware
of this risk, the Government is pursuing a public acceptance campaign. The
second risk concerns possible delays in implementing the classroom construction
program owing to the Ministry of National Education's limited technical capa-
city and the experimental nature of cost-sharing with communities. To reduce
this risk, a key criterion for selecting the target communities is their
commitment to contribute about 25X of the classroom construction costs in cash
or kind.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
