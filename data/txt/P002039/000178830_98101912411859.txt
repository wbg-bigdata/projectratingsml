NIGERIA
FORESTRY PLANTATION PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Federal Military Government of Nigeria (FMG) has requested the
Bank Group to assist in financing a forestry plantation project in the Ondo,
Ogun, Cross River and Anambra States. An identification mission visited
Nigeria in March 1977, and agreement was reached on location, concept and
preparation arrangements for the project. Subsequently, an FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program preparation mission visited Nigeria in May 1977 and
submitted its report in October 1977. The Cross River State subproject was
subsequently excluded from the project, because of its low rate of return,
and because only 3,000 ha of new plantings were required to ensure sufficient
pulp wood supplies to the Itu pulp mill, which can be established by the State
Forestry Service.
1.02      The project, which would be the first comprehensive Bank investment
in the forestry sector in Nigeria, is expected to:
(a) assist in meeting part of Nigeria's increasing demand
for utility-grade timber;
(b) provide pulpwood for a Federal pulp and paper mill
presently under construction in Ogun State; and
(c) strengthen Federal Departmlent of Forestry (FDF) plan-
ning capabilities of the forestry sector.
II. THE FORESTRY SECTOR
A.   The Economy
2.01      Nigeria.  The Federal Republic of Nigeria comprises 19 States and
covers a total land area of 924,000 km2. Total 1977 population is estimated
at roughly 79 million, which is nearly 20% of the total for the African con-
tinent.  Average GDP per capita (estimated at around US$420 in 1977) is low
and unevenly distributed; income in rural areas is considerably lower.
2.02      Economic Trends.  The Nigerian economy is dominated by the oil
sector, which accounts for about 30 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export
earnings and 80 percent of Government revenue. The increase in oil prices in
1973/74 enabled the Government to embark on a massive investment program and
this contributed to GNP growth averaging 6 percent per annum between 1973 and
1977. However, growth was concentrated in those sectors that benefited in
particular from the rapid expansion in Government expenditure, i.e. infra-
structure, education and large scale manufacturing, and performance of the
productive sectors, notably agriculture, has been disappointing.



- 2 -
2.03      The unprecedented rise in public spending (Federal current ex-
penditure increased from US$1.1 billion in 1973/74 to US$4.2 billion in
1977/78, and capital expenditure from US$1.2 billion to US$9.7 billion)
quickly exhausted the oil-produced internal and external surpluses, and
Nigeria now faces considerable fiscal and balance of payments constraints.
The economy was unable to generate goods and services at the rate demanded,
and consequently the domestic price level rose by an average of 26 percent
per annum between 1975 and 1977. Oil production in Nigeria is not expected
to rise much above the present level during the 1980s and overall growth
prospects for the economy are therefore considered modest.
2.04      One of the fastest growth sectors in Nigeria has been that of
construction, which caused a steep increase in the demand for wood products,
especially sawn timber, wood-based panels and construction poles. The growth
in the domestic market was so strong that exports of wood and wood products
were prohibited in 1976, and wood is now being logged at a rate greatly
exceeding the natural wood increment.
B.   Contribution of the Forestry Sector to the Economy
2.05      Up to 1960, forestry accounted for over 6 percent of GDP.  Since
then, its share has declined to around 2.5 percent in the early seventies.
The increase in oil prices and the consequent increase in the contribution
of Government services to GDP caused a further relative decline to around
2.0 percent in 1977, when total value added in this sector amounted to about
N 0.4 billion (about US$0.62 billion). The declining importance of forestry
as a foreign exchange earner has followed a similar course from 5 percent in
the early sixties to less than 1 percent a decade later. The forestry sector
provides employment for about 1.5 million people of which the vast majority
are employed in the collection of firewood and in the production of poles.
The production and processing of logs in the high forest zone involves only
about 50,000 people.
2.06      The decline in the relative importance of forestry cannot be ex-
plained solely by the strong growth in the oil and government services sectors,
in that forestry has also become less important relative to agriculture. In
1960, forestry accounted for 10 percent of the total value added in agricul-
ture, but ten years later this figure had been reduced to 6 percent, due both
to the continuing clearing of natural forest for agricultural purposes and to
the failure to develop forest plantations before actual wood supplies fell
short of requirements.
C.   Forest Resources and Industries
2.07      The population pressure in Nigeria has led to a continuous con-
version of forests into agricultural lands.  In order to prevent the total
depletion of Nigerif's forest resources, the Federal Government to date has
set aside 95,000 km of forests, about 10 percent of Nigeria's total land
area, as forest reserves   Of the reserves, which are the sole responsibility
of the States, 75,000 km are located in the Savannah Zone, and 20,000 km



--3 -
in the High Forest Zone.  The Savannah forests produce fuelwood and poles, and
make no contribution to the supply of sawlogs.  The latter product is supplied
from the High Forest Zone.  Near y a]l areas of High Forest outside the
reserves, estimated at 50,000 km in the 1940's, are being transformed inrto
agricultural land, and sawlog supplies from these are expected to be totally
exhausted by 1990. Thus, the 20,000 km of forest reserves in the High Forest
Zone will soon be the only source of sawlogs in Nigeria.
2.08      An inventory made by the FAO/UNDP High Forest Development Project in
Ibadan shows that, of the 2 million hectares of High Forest Reserves, about
1.6 million hectares are economically accessible Sor exploitation.  With an
annual natural increment of sawlogs of 31 to 1.5 m  (r) 1/ per hectare, annual
sustainable yield is about 2 million m (r). Higher output from the same area
can only be obtained at the expense of future yields by overcutting, or by
increasing the number of utilizable species, and/or by establishing plantations
with fast-growing species. Therefore, immediate priorities now recognized
by Government are to manage these forests more rationally on a sustained yield
basis; to resist pressures for de-reservation and to investigate and develop
markets for the lesser known species; and to increase the annual rate of
planting with fast-growing species. By the end of 1976, about 115,000 ha of
plantations had been established, of which 34% could be utilized as pulpwood.
However, the current rate of planting, averaging about 10,000 ha annually,
is inadequate to meet expected demand (para 2.20).
2.09      The sawmilling industry, producing about 1 million m  (s) 2/ an-
nually, located in the High Forest Zcone, is fairly well developed.  The
country has a total of about 500 privately owned sawmills, 80 percent of which
are found in the Western and Mid-Western part of the country, Of this total,
there are 23 large sawmills with a total output of 230,000 m annually that
produce an accurately sawn and well graded product. In comparison, the
product of the small mills is of poor quality, but production costs are lower,
and it is acceptable for most local uses.
2.10      Five plywood mills produce 74,000 m  3/ of plywood per year.  Two
new mills3and the expansion  of one existing mill will bring total capacity to
110,000 m  in 1980.  Four particle board mills Ire expected to come on stream
before 1980, with a total capacity of 103,000 m . There are no known plans
for production of fiberboard, and with this exception, prospective production

1978.



- 4 -
capacity in wood-based panels is more than sufficient to supply the domestic
market, and it is not inconceivable that the present ban on the export of
wood products will be lifted for wood-based panels once the mills now under
construction are in operation.
2.11      At present, Nigeria has only one paper mill at Jebba (Kwara State)
producing 12,000 tons of primarily industrial paper from imported pulp and
waste paper. However, two new mills are under construction, each with pulping
facilities that are expected to start production in 1981. One mill at Itu,
Cross River State, should produce 100,000 tons of newsprint per year, and the
other mill at Iwopin, Ogun State, 65,000 tons of fine paper, plus 54,000 tons
of pulp for export. Additionally, the existing mill at Jebba is to be expanded
and converted to produce 60,000 tons of industrial paper a year from its own
short fiber pulp.  The increased output should be readily taken up by the
domestic market, except for part of the newsprint, which would initially be
exported.
2.12      The mills have been designed to use Gmelina arborea 1/ as pulpwood.
Plantings are about sufficient for the Itu mill, but have fallen far short
for the Iwopin mill, and because of the current low rate of planting, the mill
will face serious shortages until 1990 when production from the Bank assisted
project will be on stream. Studies have shown that the Iwopin mill is finan-
cially viable because of its design and location. Although the stumpage rates
used in the studies for the pulpwood were unrealistically low, analysis has
shown that the financial viability is relatively insensitive to higher stumpage
rates (Project File Supplement 6). The extended Jebba mill will initially use
mixed woods from the Savannah forests until the production of the specially
established Gmelina plantations produce sufficient pulpwood. All three mills
will import long fiber pulp. It should, however, be possible to grow long
fiber material in Nigeria, and trials to grow Pinus caribaea should be estab-
lished to determine the economics of producing long fiber pulpwood at different
locations.
D.   Financing the Sector
2.13      The sawmilling, plywood and veneer industries are traditionally
financed by the private sector. They are generally profitable and sufficient
financing seems to be available for expansion. The pulp and paper mill
capacity (230,000 tons) now under construction, costing about N 400 million,
has been largely financed by the Federal and State Governments.
2.14      The logging industry is wholly private.  The larger wood-based indus-
tries generally conduct their own logging operations, with small industries
buying logs from independent loggers. The production of wood through forest
plantations is wholly financed by the Federal and State Governments. For

- 5 -
the next 15 to 20 years, about N 40 million (in 1978 terms) 1/ will be needed
annually for plantation establishment if Nigeria wants to remain self-
sufficient in wood supplies. Since the present revenue of about N 6 million
per year, collected by State Governments from log extraction, is unrealistically
low, increasing stumpage fees should be a priority to generate income for this
plantation program.
E.   Institutions and Manpower
2.15      There are two Federal institutions concerned with forestry in
Nigeria: the Federal Department of Forestry (FDF) and the Forest Research
Institute of Nigeria (FRIN).  The FDF, established in 1971, is a department
of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (FMAWR), and is
charged with:
-    formulating a national forest policy;
-    promoting forestry projects that are of national
interest, and channelling Federal funds to finance
such projects to the States; and
-    coordinating and monitorin;g State forestry activities.
The FRIN, operating independently, is responsible for forestry research in
Nigeria, and its relationship to the FDF and the State Forest Services is
mainly that of a consultant.
2.16      The State Forest Services are directly responsible for the actual
management of the forest reserves as well as for the control of the exploita-
tion of non-reserved forests. Each State has a Department of Forestry within
the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR), headed by a Chief
Conservator of Forests (CCF). The function of the State Forest Services has
been protection and control of the e:xploitation of the natural forests.
Except for the pulpwood plantation programs, plantation activity has been
minimal and has not been related to any specific programs and targets.
2.17      Nigeria's forestry sector is reviewed twice a year by the National
Forestry Development Committee, consisting of the heads of all public forestry
agencies, with responsibility to the National Council for Agriculture and
Rural Development. The effectiveness of the Committee is limited by the lack
of a comprehensive forestry development plan, and by the lack of systematic
State statistics on forestry activities.
2.18      As in other sectors in Nigeria, one of the main problems is the
scarcity of qualified manpower in forestry. In the public forest services,
1/   Establishment of 25,000 ha of plantation per year at N 1,600 per ha.



- 6 -
vacancies range from 20 percent upwards of approved positions. Indications
are that there will be about 200 vacancies in the professional grades in the
early 1980's. Similarly, at the technical level there will be a shortage
of not less than 2,500 technicians. The professional training capability
at the University of Ibadan, and technical training facilities for Forest
Assistants at Ibadan and Jos are insufficient, and even with new forestry
training facilities being planned, it will be a long time before trained
manpower output will meet requirements. In the meantime, however, the project,
at Federal level, would be advising the Government in staff training and
education, and would assist in preparing training projects for possible future
Bank lending (para. 4.12 and 4.13). In addition, better utilization of
existing manpower is possible and should be pursued.
F.   Objectives, Strategies and Policies
2.19      Forest policy objectives as formulated in the Third National Develop-
ment Plan include:
-    increasing wood supplies by establishing plantations
of fast-growing species;
-    promoting forest industries through tariff policies
and by exploring ways in which lesser known species
can be used in industries such as furniture and
match making;
-    ensuring an adequate supply of pulpwood for the proposed
pulp and paper mills; and
-    promoting fire prevention, watershed management
and soil conservation through forest planting and
proper management.
The policy does not quantify targets against which actual achievements can be
evaluated. It is therefore necessary to prepare a long-term comprehensive
forestry plan, detailing demand and alternative supply services, and the proj-
ect would assist Government in preparing such a plan (para. 4.12).
2.20      Total demand for wood products in Nigeria exceeds 52 million m
annually, 90% of which (49 million m ) is consumed as fuelwood and building
poles by the rural and low income Irban population. The demand for industrial
wood products, about 3.1 million m 3of roundwood equivalent in 1177, is ex-
pected to increase to 5.7 million m in 1985, and 11.7 million m in 1995, which
would require a planting program of at least 25,000 ha per year from now until
1995. Fuelwood supplies will not constitute a problem in the South of Nigeria,
but the North, where there are already scarcities in most of the large cities,
will face serious shortages of this commodity.
2.21      To execute a planting program of 25,000 ha per year, a considerable
strengthening of forestry institutions and management in Nigeria would be



- 7 -
required. At the Federal level, more attention should be given to the plan-
ning function, and an effort should be made to improve data collection from
the States. At the State level, Forest Services should improve their capacity
to implement large scale planting programs.
2.22      The increasing importance of plantation-grown wood should not lead
to a neglect of the productive capacity of the natural forests. By 1995,
these forests will still produce around 17 percent of Nigeria's industrial
wood requirements. The production from the natural forests can be improved
by: introducing lesser known species into the market; exercising a tighter
control over logging practices; preventing illegal felling and farming in
the forest reserves; and by resisting pressures to dereserve forest areas
for agricultural production. The introduction of efficient fire protection
measures should benefit the development of both plantations and natural
forests. The UNDP/FAO High Forest Project includes these measures in its
program of work (para. 4.17).
G.   Bank Involvement in the Forestry Sector
2.23      The Bank has assisted in small forestry components for firewood
and poles in two agricultural development projects (Lafia-Loan 1454-UNI,
Ayangba-Loan 1455-UNI), both are in their first year of operation and are
being implemented satisfactorily. Hcowever, this project will be the first
comprehensive Bank assistance to the forestry sector in Nigeria, and is
fully in line with the recent Forestry Sector Policy Paper. 1/ The latter
emphasizes the importance of the development of forest plantations in rural
areas, and stresses the crucial role of management and institution building
in the development of the forestry sector. The proposed project covers both
of these objectives.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A.   Physical Features
3.01      Location.  The project areas (Map IBRD 13785) cover 11,300 ha of
the Omo forest reserve in Ogun State, 11,300 ha of the Oluwa forest reserve
in Ondo State and 1,600 ha in the proposed Mbanasa forest reserve in Anambra
State. The areas in the Omo and Oluwa Forest Reserves have been heavily
exploited by concessionaires over the past 25 years and contain relatively
few acceptable species of exploitable size. The total size of these reserves
is about 260,000 ha, with 11,000 ha cif Gmelina established, thus, sufficient
land will be available for a long-term plantation program. No difficulty is
foreseen in gazetting the Mbanasa reserve, following the promulgation of the
Land Use Decree of March 1978. However, a condition of disbursement against
the Anambra subproject would be the gazetting of this forest reserve, the
legal procedures for which are well-advanced.

-8-
3.02      The population residing adjacent to the Omo and Oluwa reserves
is relatively light, and there is very little land pressure. The situation
around Mbanasa is different; however, the land set aside for plantation
development has soils mainly unsuitable for agriculture, and the best use
of the land would be to convert it to forest by planting.
3.03      Topography and Soils.  In all the project areas, the land is
between 100 and 300 m above sea level, and is undulating with occasionally
steep slopes and hilly outcrops. The High Forest soils in Omo and Oluwa
reserves are dominantly ferralitic, old and highly weathered. The major
geological formations over the whole region are crystalline rocks of the
pre-Cambrian Basement Complex, with frequent outcrops of granites, gneisses,
quartzites and schists. The surface horizons are usually loamy or sandy,
becoming heavier with depth, and are moderately acid. Kaolinite is the
dominant clay mineral, giving a low base exchange capacity. They are charac-
terized by the quick and complete transformation of organic matter and the
rapid removal by leaching of its decomposition products, soluble salts,
exchangeable bases and silica. Agricultural potential of these soils is only
fair. Although these areas, after being clear felled and burned, can produce
food crops, the rapid decline in nutrient status will, under the existing
techniques, allow productive cropping for only 1 to 2 years. The hydro-
morphic soils of the valley bottoms suffer from impeded drainage, but are
sufficiently fertile to produce a variety of food crops including rice.
3.04      Apart from small tracts of shallow soils and lateritic outcrops, the
soils of the Mbanasa project area are deep and sandy, excessively drained and
very erodible. Due to the very light vegetation cover, they have a lower
initial organic matter content than soils in the High Forest Zone, and are
correspondingly less suitable for agricultural cropping.
3.05      Vegetation (MAP IBRD 13786).  The plantation projects in the Ogun
and Ondo States lie within the High Forest. The Mbanasa reserve lies in
the Derived-Savannah, with only a few tree species left, and the vegetation
mainly consisting of perennial grasses such as Andropogon Sp. and Hyparrhenia
Sp.
3.06      Climate.  Annual rainfall in the 3 project areas varies from around
1,500 mm to 1,800 mm, most of it falling from March to October. Rainfall dis-
tribution is bi-modal, with a marked decline in August. Radiation, tempera-
ture and sunlight hours peak in January/February, and are at their lowest in
July/August when dull overcast conditions are experienced.
B.   Infrastructure and Social Services
3.07      The two High Forest areas lie close to one of the country's main
highways (Lagos-Benin), and are both served by a good all-weather road.
Within the forest reserves, there are numerous logging roads of various
qualities. Forest products are therefore easily transported from the reserves
to the larger towns in Southwest Nigeria, including the pulp and paper mill
at Iwopin.  The road network in the Mbanasa area is less adequate, but a



--9-
new highway is being constructed from Enugu, which will make access to the
project easier. The sandy tracks wi'thin the area linking the surrounding
villages are generally in poor condi'tion.
3.08      The social services provicied within and adjacent to the 3 project
areas are poor, as no rural electrif'ication and basic water supply systems
exist. Furthermore, health services and schools are in very short supply
in the area.
IV. THE PROJECT 1/
A.   Project Objectives
4.01      The project consists of 3 subprojects, namely two identical large
scale Gmelina plantation projects in Ondo and Ogun States respectively, and a
trial pine plantation project in Anambra State. Project objectives, which are
in full accord with Federal and State Government policies (para 2.19) are to
increase roundwood production from plantation development to meet part of
Nigeria's increasing demand for utility-grade timber; to provide short fiber
pulpwood from thinnings of these plantations for a pulp and paper mill; to
provide employment and social servic:es and to increase local food production
in the rural areas; to improve forest plantation management in 3 States, and
strengthen the FDF's sector planning capabilities; to carry out trials with
pines to assess the viability of projects to supply long fiber pulpwood
to Nigeria's pulp and paper industries. The project, which comprises only a
5-year time slice, is part of a long-term plantation development program in
the country.
B.   Project Description
4.02      Summary.  The project to be implemented during the 5-year period
1979-1984 would involve:
Forest Plantation and Food Crop Production
-    Establishment of 11,300 ha of Gmelina plantations in
each of the Omo and Oluwa forest reserves, located
in Ogun and Ondo States re!spectively;
-    establishment of 1,600 ha of Tropical Pine and Eucalyptus
trials in the proposed Mbanasa forest reserve in Anambra
State, and introductory trials of Tropical Pine in selected
forest reserves in Ogun and Ondo States, and other selected
areas;
1/   See Project File (Annex 1).



- 10 -
maintenance and protection of the existing Gmelina plantation
of about 7,000 ha in Omo forest reserve and about 4,000 ha
in Oluwa forest reserve;
establishing adequate plantation protection systems,
including the erection of fire towers and the establish-
ment of radio communication; and
increasing food production by allowing 1,400 ha of Taungya 1/
farming annually, and by planting 500 ha of maize annually
on a pilot basis, using mechanization and minimum tillage
methods in newly cleared areas of forest prior to planting
them with trees.
Civil Works
-    constructing project offices, workshops, and staff and
forest villages, improving electricity, water supplies and
other services in the 3 project areas;
-    constructing about 610 km of primary plantation roads and
930 km of plantation tracks, and maintaining selected existing
and new plantation roads; and
-    clearing about 27,000 ha of degraded High Forest, and
1,600 ha of light Savannah woodland for plantation and
infrastructure development.
Institutional Support and Technical Assistance
-    strengthening the management of the State plantation
projects and the monitoring and planning capabilities
of FDF by providing the required technical, administrative
staff and logistical support;
-    provision of in-service and overseas training; and
-    provision of consultancy services to assist FDF and the
States to review forestry policies; provision of technical
consultancies aiming at introducing new technologies in
the forestry sector and preparation of future forestry
projects.
/   Taungya - local farmers are allocated temporary plots in the forest
reserve and are allowed to intercrop with annual food crops making use
of the fertility of the forest soil until the plantation-grown trees
close canopy, when they are allocated fresh areas.

Detailed Features
Forest Plantation and Food Crop Production
4.03      Gmelina.  The two plantation subprojects in the
Forest Zone in the Ondo and Ogun States would establish a total of 22,600 ha
of Gmelina plantation. Before the areas are mechanically cleared, salvage
logging of the remaining utilizable trees would be carried out by "tree
takers." They would remove trees which are still in demand by the numerous
sawmills in the High Forest Zo e.  The area to be cleared by the project will
produce an estimated 700,000 m of logs for these sawmills, amounting to
about 7% of their present estimated annual input. About 45 million open-root
Gmelina seedlings would be established in the nurseries. Seedlings would be
planted ouit in an annual planting program reaching 3,000 ha in Year 4 in each
subproject. The plantation would supply pulpwood from thinnings in Year 8,
and sawlogs and Dulpwood in Year 16 after planting.
4.04      Tropical Pines in the Derived Savannah.  The trial plantation
project in Anambra State would establish 1,600 ha of Tropical Pines, and would
include some eucalyptus.  Nurseries would raise a total of 2.6 million pines
and eucalyptus seedlings in pots. T'he plantation would assess the viability
of supplying long fiber pulpwood on a 15 year rotation, and/or sawlogs and
poles on a longer rotation to be determined once growth rates have been
measured.  The integration of grazing with plantation management for the
production of sawlogs on reduced rotations will be investigated. The silvi-
culturalist in charge of the trial pLantation in Mbanasa would also conduct
smal!L scale introductory pine trials for the production of long fiber pulpwood
in areas near the pulp and paper mills.
4.05      Tree Farming.  The replacemnent of the traditional bush fallow with
a plantation fallow of Gmelina for the maintenance of soil fertility, and the
provision of a cash income for the farmer will be investigated.
4.06      Food Production.  Food production would be promoted through about
5,000 Taungya farmers who would farm about 1,400 ha annually in the two High
Forest project areas. Areas allocated to Taungya farmers would be cleared by
the farmers, except for large trees which would be cleared by the project.
After harvest, these areas would be planted with trees. Extension advice in
improved technology and basic managemnent of food crops such as maize and
yams would be provided by the project. In view of the rapid canopy closure
of the Gmelina trees, farming will be possible for only one season. In addi-
tion to the Taungya farming, the two subprojects would each carry out pilot
mechanized maize production on 250 ha annually prior to tree planting, the
Output of which would be used for ani.mal feed. After clearing, the debris
wouicl be slowly burned in situ to ensure maximum increase in pH, essential for
maize production in these soils.  A rmechanized minimum tillage approach would
be introduced to protect the fragile top soil.  The concept of utilizing the
fertility of the forest soil without interfering with the development of the



- 1 2 -
planted trees, conforms to the FMG desire to increase food production for the
nation. This program would be carefully monitored, and after 3 years, would
be reviewed as to its appropriateness.
4.07      Civil Works.  Infrastructural development, which represents the
major part of the project development costs, consists of the construction of
housing, buildings, workshops, stores and roads, and the provision of some
basic social services in forest villages (school, dispensary, community hall),
including water supply and electricity. Ondo and Ogun subprojects will each
have an administrative center consisting of a project office, mechanical
workshop and storage facilities, staff and labor housing, water and electri-
city supplies and community services. Because of the trial nature of the
Anambra project, facilities would be kept to a minimum. To save cost and
time, the use of prefabricated wooden units built on concrete slabs for staff
housing and offices are proposed. These are available on short delivery from
large manufacturing plants, which also provide assistance in erecting the
units. Provision of labor quarters is made for half of the permanent labor
force as the remainder will be supplied from nearby villages.
4.08      Some old logging roads exist in the project areas, but to facilitate
initial planting, firebreaks and subsequent maintenance, it is necessary to
provide each subproject with a basic road system. Most of these roads would
eventually be used for log extraction. However, there is no justification to
maintain these roads to a logging standard, so that upgrading would be the
responsibility of the log extraction agency at the appropriate time. Road
construction would be carried out on force account and is based on a road net-
work of 2 km all-season plantation roads and 3 km dry-season tracks per 100 ha
plantation.
4.09      Because of shortage of labor and the required planting target of
3,000 ha/year, clearing would have to be mechanized in the Ogun and Ondo sub-
projects. It would be carried out by heavy tractors using combinations of
equipment, including tree pushers, bulldozer blades and mounted rakes for
wind-rowing. In the savannah area of Anambra State, mechanical clearing
by heavy tractor and bulldozer blade is proposed, mainly to remove all stumps,
leaving the soils in a condition that would enable tractor-drawn disc ploughs
and harrows to cultivate the soils for optimum survival and development of
the pines and eucalyptus.
Institutional Support and Technical Assistance
4.10      Management and Evaluation.  Assistance would be provided to the
State Forestry Services in Ogun, Ondo and Anambra for the management of their
expanded intensive industrial plantation program, and to FDF to improve its
monitoring and planning capabilities.
4.11      At State level, a substantial increase in local staff and improved
training programs would be required. Specialists would be recruited during
the initial development period to assist in silviculture plantation management
in the engineering, management and maintenance aspects of forest clearing and
road construction by heavy machinery, and in all training programs.



-, 13 -
4.12      At Federal level, the marLagement division of FDF would be strength-
ened by the provision of 5 specialists. They would provide technical support
in the collection, processing and evaluation of data of the forestry sector,
project preparation, applied silviculture research and financial management,
and staff training, and would assist the division in setting up a central data
bank of basic scctor planning and project information.
4.13      Training.  The State projects would be in themselves an extensive
training effort in plantation development operations and would provide a sound
basis for on-the-job training under the supervision of competent senior staff.
To supplement the latter, the project would also provide formal training pro-
grams either at the project training center to be established in or near Ogun
or Ondo State, or at other existing training institutions, or overseas. The
project training center, to be owned and managed by FDF, for which about
N 150,000 has been allocated for classrooms, dormitories, and other training
facilities, would provide short courses in plantation management for profes-
sional foresters from other States, and courses for junior technical staff
in silvicultural practices, record-keeping, forest inventory work, equipment
maintenance, etc.   Under the project, consultants would work with the
FDF training officer and assist the project management units to establish
training programs (para 4.15f). The recently established FAO/UNDP Forest
Mechanization School in Kaduna State would provide training for project
operators of heavy equipment. Project training courses would be given by
senior project staff and by senior FDF technical staff, including staff of
the FAO/UNDP Forest Management Capability Project (para 4.17).
4.14      The project would also provide, over a 5-year period, about
US$200,000 for approximately 123 manmonths of fellowships as follows:
-    84 manmonths for forest officers in forest clearing
operations and heavy equipment maintenance, silvi-
cultural practices, forest: management and fire
protection;
-    24 manmonths for post graduate training in forest
economics; and
-    15 manmonths for post gracluate forestry training
to be decided by FDF in consultation with the Bank.
4.15      Consultancy Services.  The project would provide 60 manmonths of
consultant services, costed at about. US$8,000 per manmonth (consisting of
US$5,000 fees and US$3,000 vehicles, equipment, operating costs, travel and
per diem expenses), to assist FDF ar,d the 3 plantation projects in specific
areas where local skills are unavailable, or where short-term supplementation
is required. While precise details of consultancy would be adjustable during
project implementation, specifically, the consultants would:



- 14 -
(a) assist FDF in preparing a feasibility study for a second
phase forestry project. This project would be either
a second time slice of the present proposed project,
or could be one of the already identified projects
(e.g., plantation development for the Jebba mill
(para 2.12), plantation development in the Savannah Zone,
firewood plantations, shelterbelt development in Sudan
Zone, forestry training). The consultants (12 manmonths)
would provide specialist support to the project staff
recruited to strengthen the management division of FDF;
(b) study the viability of transforming cleared forests into
charcoal, and assess the possibility for marketing charcoal
for local industrial uses. Provision for 6 manmonths, plus
the purchase of portable kilns, have been made;
(c) carry out an evaluation of the prospects of commercial produc-
tion of lumber, and seasoning and preservation of timber of
15-year old plantation-grown Gmelina (6 manmonths), including
assistance from timber technology laboratories and commercial
sawmills;
(d) review forestry tariffs and concession agreements by the
State Forestry Services, particularly for those States
where revenues from timber are important to the State
economy. Most fees and royalties (stumpage) paid by
loggers to the State have not been revised for years and
do not bear any relation to the value of timber on the
domestic market. Equally, concession agreements between
companies and State Governments should be reviewed to
ensure that revenues paid by concessionaires are consistent
with the changing value of the produce. Consultant specia-
lists in forestry law and taxation (10 manmonths) should
work in close liaison with FDF and the State forestry
departments in drawing up their recommendations. In view of
its importance to the financial viability of the plantation
project, an assurance was obtained that MANR of both
Ogun and Ondo States would prepare and submit to the Bank
before March 31, 1980 for review and consultation, proposals
regarding a formula for calculating the stumpage rates for
salvage logs from the natural forest, Gmelina pulpwood
and Gmelina sawlogs.
(e) provide for technical consultancy (14 manmonths) on a
periodic basis to review and make recommendation on
improvements of forest clearing techniques, silvicultural
practices, plantation management, and the mensuration
of Gmelina and pine plantations in the three project areas;



- 15 -
(f) provide assistance in establishing plantation management
and junior technical training courses at the project
training ceniter. The consultants (8 manmonths) would
assist the Project Management Units and FDF to develop
such a program by April 1, 1980, and would visit the
project during the initial years to assess progress
of staff training and development. Findings would be
reported to FDF and Ogun, Ondo and Anambra States and
the Bank; and
(g) provide technical consultancy (4 manmonths) to assist
FDF in interpretation of side-looking airborne radar
and satellite imagery.
4.16      The consultants are likely to be recruited either from consultant
firms or as individuals. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
the management division of FDF would be responsible for the preparation of
their detailed terms of reference for review by the Bank, and that consultants
and consultant firms would be appointed with qualifications, experience, and
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
4.17      The project's technical assistance program is complementary to the
technical assistance provided by the FAO/UNDP Project (Development of Forestry
Management Capability) which would, in particular, assist FDF to manage the
natural High Forest on a sustained yi(eld basis and the marketing of lesser
known species (para 2.08).
C.   Costs and Financing Arrangements
4.18      Cost Estimates.  Project costs during the 5-year development period
are estimated at N 51.5 million (US$79.3 million), of which, N 20.1 million
(US$31.0 million), or 39%, would be foreign exchange. Cost estimates are
incremental and include an estimated N 2.1 million of identifiable in-
direct taxes and duties. Base cost estimates are based on prices obtained
during appraisal, updated to include baseline costs expected at the end of
1978. Costs include:
physical contingencies equal to 5% of base cost
estimates;
-    price contingencies for foreign costs in accordance
with the Bank's general guidelines calculated on
base costs plus physical contingencies compounded
annually, applying the following annual rates of
inflation:



- 16 -
Inflation Rate %
1979     1980-5
Vehicles, Plant Equipment, Spare Parts                6.5     6.0
and Farm Inputs
Civil Works, Buildings, Houses Road
Construction, and Construction Materials              7.5     7.0
Salaries, Consultants and Overseas Training           7.0     7.0
-    price contingencies for local costs at 20% compounded annually,
except for salaries and labor employed directly by the project
where an annual estimated rate of 13% is used.
4.19      Total contingencies calculated on the foregoing basis are equivalent
to 31% of total costs, or 46% of baseline costs. This large contingency
component reflects, following the 1975-77 inflation rate of 26% per annum, the
high (20%) annual inflation rate expected in Nigeria during the life of the
Project. Details of project costs are presented in Annex 2 and summarized in
the table on page 17.
4.20.     Project costs and price contingencies have been calculated on
the assumption that the exchange rate between the naira and the dollar will
remain fixed at 1.54 throughout the project period. This closely reflects
the experience of recent years during which time the exchange rate changed
relatively little despite a rate of domestic inflation in Nigeria which
consistently exceeded international inflation by a significant margin.
4.21.     The estimates of project cost in dollar terms would be affected by
a change in exchange rate policy. If, for example, there were to be a 20%
devaluation to compensate for the system of import duties and export incen-
tives currently in force and if the exchange rate were to be adjusted
thereafter to compensate fully for the difference between domestic and inter-
national inflation projected for future years, then the local component of
project costs would be lower when expressed in dollar terms. Under these
assumptions the local component of project costs would amount to $29.6 million
compared with the $48.3 million estimated on the basis of the present exchange
rate. Total project cost would, therefore, amount to only $60.6 million
(compared with $79.3 million estimated on the basis of the present exchange
rate) and the share of total project cost financed by the Bank loan would be
51 percent (compared with 39 percent estimated on the basis of the present
exchange rate.)

Proposed Financing
4.22      Of the total project cost of N 51.5 million, IBRD would finance
N 20.1 million (US$31.0 million) at the lending rate current at the time
of loan approval, repayable over a period of 20 years, including a 5-year
grace period. The Bank loan would cover 39% of total project costs,
equivalent to the foreign exchange costs; FMG would finance N 16.3 million
(US$25.1 million), or 32% of total project costs, and the balance N 15.1
million (US$23.2 million), representing 29% of the project costs, will be
provided by the three State Governments: Ondo (ODSG N 6.9 million); Ogun
(OGSG N 6.9 million); and Anambra (ANSG N 1.3 million). A summary of the
proposed financing plan is shown below:

4.23      The Bank loan would be made to the Federal Government, who would
onlend part of it, N 18.8 million (US$29.0 million) on the same terms and
conditions to Ondo and Ogun, and possibly on more favourable terms to Anambra,
in view of the trial' nature of this subproject, viz. ODSG N 8.7 million
(US$13.4 million), OGSG N 8.7 million (US$13.4 million), and ANSG N 1.4
(US$2.2 million). The signing of subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to
the Bank, between FMG and the three State Governments, covering both onlending



- 19 -
of the Bank loan and FMG and State Government contributions would be a condi-
tion of disbursement against each individual State. Ongoing projects are
suffering from inadequate inflow of funds from Government sources, and in
order to overcome this problem, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that:
(a)  Bank disbursements would be rmade directly to the Project
Management Units' (PMU's) commercial bank accounts
(para 4.27);
(b) the stumpage fees arising from salvaged logs of natural
forests and from plantation pulpwood and sawlogs would be
paid into the PMU's bank accounts to constitute a revolving
fund to provide sufficient funds enabling the State Govern-
ment of Ondo and Ogun to carry out their planned annual
planting programs (para. 8.02);
(c)  until such time as sufficient funds are accumulated out
of stumpage fees to form a revolving fund and to overcome
difficulties posed by possible delays in supply of local
funds, PMUs and Forestry Division, Anambra (FDA) would be
authorized to establish overdraft facilities equivalent
to six months project expenditures based on the approved
annual project budgets, and that the overdraft would be
guaranteed by the respective State Governments;
(d) during the 5-year development period, FMG, ODSG, OGSG and
ANSG would provide their quarterly contributions to the
respective project accounts at least 3 months in advance,
and in accordance with the approved annual budget; and
(e) at least four months prior to each fiscal year, the
management of the respective PMUs would submit their
proposed annual budgets, as approved by the Budget and
Policy Coordinating Committee (BPCC) (para 6.02) and the
CCF in Anambra, to the FMARD, State MANRS and the Bank.
D.   Procurement and Disbursement
4.24      Motor vehicles, plant and equipment and spares for forest clearing,
and roadmaking equipment and tractors, valued at N 13.2 million (US$20.3 mil-
lion) would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) and in
accordance with Bank guidelines for contracts over US$100,000, and through
competitive bidding and in accordance with local procedures satisfactory to
the Bank for contracts less than US$100,000. For contracts of less than
US$30,000, local competitive shopping would be acceptable. Items for procure-
ment would be bulked to permit optimum use of competitive bidding. In the
case of ICB domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a 15% preference
or the applicable import duty, whichever is lower when comparing bids with
those of foreign manufacturers. Experience has shown that contracts for
houses, stores, and buildings, which are valued at about N 12.0 million



- 20 -
(US$18.5 million) are not attractive to foreign contractors due to dispersed
locations and small size of contracts, and would therefore be awarded on the
basis of local competitive bidding with procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Forest clearing valued at N 6.3 million (US$9.6 million) and plantation
roads valued at N 4.0 million (US$6.2 million) would be undertaken on force
account, except for Anambra plantation roads which would be done under local
competitive bidding due to the small size of the program. Force account is
necessary because these are ongoing operations and located in areas where
there are no capable contractors available to do the work. Force account
operations in Nigeria are cheaper than contractors because of limited capa-
bility and capacity and local conditions. The Bank is not financing the
local cost component of force account. A large part of the project cost
would be local salaries and operating expenses valued at ebout N 12.7 million
(US$19.6 million) which are unsuitable for competitive bidding. The services
of consultants valued at N 3.3 million (US$ 5.1 million) would be obtained in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Disbursement
4.25      The Bank loan would be disbursed during 1979-84 as follows (details
are in Annex 2, Table 7) and expenditures would be fully documented.
CATEGORY I      100% of the foreign exchange expendi-         US$16.1 million
tures of directly imported vehicles,
tractors forest clearing/roadmaking
equipment spare parts and other agri-
cultural supplies and equipment or if
locally procured, 89% of these expendi-
tures.
CATEGORY II    100% of the foreign exchange expendi-          US$7.0 million
tures of directly imported building
materials and equipment, or 38% of
the total expenditures of buildings
and houses.
CATEGORY III   100% of the foreign exchange expendi-          US$5.1 million
tures or 60% of total expenditures of
internationally recruited staff (in-
cluding their salaries, allowances
and recruitment costs), consultancy
services and overseas training for
local staff.
US$28.2 million

E.   Budgets, Accounts and Audit
4.26      FDF, FDA and each PMU would keep records in accordance with sound
accounting practices to reflect its operational and financial position and
to provide evaluation data. The accounts would be audited by a firm of
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audited accounts
and the auditor's report, including a statement as to whether or not Bank
funds had been used for their intended purpose, would be submitted to the Bank
within four months of the end of the fiscal year. Assurances to this effect
were obtained during negotiations.
4.27      Annual budgets would be prepared by each PMU, FDA and FDF based on
appraisal estimates amended where necessary to reflect changes in costs and
project development policies. With the assistance of FDF's Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit, a uniform budget format would be introduced in the first
project year, which would adequately portray project activities unit costs
and productivity and form the basis of a proper management information system.
Annual budgets would be submitted to the BPCC and in Anambra to the CCF for
approval. The PMUs and FDA would prepare quarterly cash flow statements,
which would be submitted to BPCC and CCF, and PMUs and FDA would operate on
the basis of these statements unless informed otherwise. On the basis of
the approved annual budgets, the Federal and State Governments would make
budgetary allocations and thereafter would make available to PMUs all neces-
sary funds quarterly and in advance (para 4.23). Separate bank accounts
for the PMUs would be opened with commercial banks, and initial deposits of
N 0.6 million, N 0.6 million and N 0.2 million respectively in Ondo, Ogun and
Anambra would be conditions of disbursement against each individual State
component.
V. TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
A.   Plantation Development
5.01      Plantation development proposals in the High Forest Zone in Omo
and Oluwa Forest Reserves are based on the edaphic and climatic conditions
existing in these areas, which are suitable for the growth of the exotic
tree Gmelina arborea. About 10,000 ha of this species have been success-
fully established in the two reserves. The species, indigenous to India
and Burma, has been grown in Nigeria Since the 1920's and thus far has proven
itself to be a rapid grower with few pests and problems in establishment. All
tests on the suitability of the wood f'or pulping have been very favorable,
and high quality paper has been manufactured from its pulp. It is also suit-
able for match-stick manufacture. Tests on its qualities for peeling have
been successful but incomplete, due to the small size of logs presently
available.  There are no recorded sawnwood tests, but furniture has been
made from planks converted in local sawmills, and a market has developed for
Gmelina logs in Anambra State where there is a shortage of indigenous white-
wood timber (para 4.15c).



- 22 -
5.023     At 8 years of age the trees have maximum annual increments of
25 m u.b./ha, 1/ after which, height increments become lower, and the annual
volume increment is reduced considerably.3 The accepted annual increment for
sawiogs in natural forests is 1.5 - 2.0 m u.b./ha, which could possibly be
doubled by intensive management. The project proposes growing Gmelina on a
15-year rotation to produce sawlogs with an average diameter of 45 cm. Pulp-
wood would be produced from thinnings at 7 years of age and from the final
felling. Ulder these proposals (annex 2, Table 11), the project would produce
about3275 m u.b./ha, namely 75 m gulpwood from 50% thinnings at Year 7, and
100 m sawlogs, and a further 100 m pulpwood when clear-felled at Year 15.
The natu5al forest production after a long cycle of 80-100 years yields only
90-120 m /ha of trees with utilizable trunks over 50 cm diameter.
5.03      Plantations would be established on cleared logged-over forest.
Stump plants from project nurseries would be used. Machine weeding would
be carried out between the planted lines of trees until the tree canopy
closes, after which, manual weeding around the trees would continue for a
further 2 years. About 10% of the annual planting areas would be cleared
manually and let to Taungya farmers who would be responsible for the care
and maintenance of the trees planted on their farms for about 2 years. In
each reserve, 250 ha of land would also be prepared for mechanized maize pro-
duction, and trees would be planted after the maize crop had been harvested.
5.04      In the Derived Savannah area of Mbanasa in Anambra State, the
climatic and edaphic conditions are considered to be more suitable for growing
tropical pines and selected eucalyptus species. There are no established
plantations of these species in the area, and the project plantings would be
confined to experimental plantings, but on a scale large enough to justify
clearing and weeding by the machines which would have to be used if large scale
plantings are ever carried out. The tropical pines would produce long fiber
pulp, which at present is imported. If demand develops, the plantation could
be managed to produce sawlogs with intermediate thinnings for posts, poles and
pulpwood. The eucalyptus would be grown primarily for the production of poles,
but selected species could be managed to produce sawlogs.
5.05      On a rotation sf 15 years, the pines are expected to produce a mean
annual increment of A1 m u.b./ha. The total production per ha at this age
would be about 165 m u.b. The indigenous Derived Savannah woodland which is
burned regularly has an annual increment of not more than 0 5 m /ha.  A well
stocked savannah forest rarely carries more than about 20 m /ha.
5.06      The plantations would be established on land mechanically cleared
of the savannah woodland. The ground would be prepared by disc plowing
1/   m  u.b. = m  under bark (without bark).



- 23 -
and disc harrowing. Container plants of both the pines and the eucalypts
would be raised in project nurseries, Imported seed would be used. Weedings
would be carried out between the lines by tractor-drawn disc harrows for a
period of 3 years. Manual weedings around the trees would be done for the
same period. After the first weeding, appropriate fertilizers would be
applied.
Food Production
5.07      Traditional Taungya farming in the two High Forest subprojects would
be permitted, and extension advice to increase output within the farmer's low
risk system of mixed cropping would be provided. Low cost inputs, especially
improved planting material and seed treatment for maize, yam and cassava would
be organized by the project and made available through MANR services.  Pilot
mechanized maize production would be carried out immediately after clearing
and burning, and after harvest, these areas would be planted with trees.
Maize would be grown by zero tillage, with expected yield of about 2 tons
per ha. The annual output of about 1000 tons would be sold mainly to local
stock feed mills.
B.   Land and Plantation Road Development
5.08      Proposals for plantation development would require a total of 24,200
ha to be cleared and windrowed over a 5-year period. In addition, a basic
plantation road and track program of 1,540 km would be implemented. The per km
construction costs (excluding overheads and right of way development costs)
of plantation roads and tracks are estimated at N 4,200 and N 1,400 respec-
tively. For the implementation of this program, Ogun and Ondo subprojects
would each establish a mechanical land clearing and road construction unit,
with suitable workshop facilities. In Anambra, land development will be
carried out by the project itself, but road construction will be done by
contractors.
5.09      To date, land clearing for forest plantation development has only
been undertaken by hand, using local contractors who have often proved un-
reliable. Past land clearing programs for forestry plantations in Ondo and
Ogun (costing about US$450-500/ha) have achieved no more than 1,000 ha per
annums, mainly due to labor shortages, particularly during peak farming
activities. The local contractors would have difficulty in obtaining suffi-
cient reliable labor and completing the work on time for programs larger than
those already accomplished. The successful completion of plantation operation
on the scale envisaged depends on a prepared time-table being adhered to.
To achieve an annual project plantat:ion program of 3,000 ha in each of the
High Forest projects, forest clearing will therefore have to be mechanized
(at a cost of about US$800/ha) as will weeding operations. Heavy 224 KV
tractors are recommended for the forest clearing operations. Plowing and
disc-harrowing would be carried out on the savannah soils where pines and
eucalyptus are to be grown. Fifty-six KV agricultural tractors would be used
to weed between the planted lines of trees. Weeding in the High Forest Zone
would initially be carried out by towed crushing rollers, but this technique
may be modified in the light of experience gained during the project.



- 24 -
5.10      Plantation roads would mainly be used to transport labor, movement
of planting material and other inputs, farm outputs and fire patrols and
fire-fighting access. Eventually, many of the roads would be used for logging
purposes. The road system would consist of primary plantation roads in a 1 km
x 1 km grid, thereby creating 100 ha blocks for plantations. Inside each
block, three parallel tracks at 250 m spacing would provide secondary access.
Development on this basis would require 2 km of primary roads and 3 km of
tracks for each 100 ha developed. Only the primary roads would be gravelled
and compacted and would follow the standard dimensions for local council roads
(6.7 m wide with 3.7 m surfaced with laterite). The Plantation tracks would be
built to minimum standard, would not be surfaced and would be located to ensure
minimum drainage costs. All primary plantation roads, and depending on need,
some of the access tracks would be maintained annually.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Organization and Management
6.01      The day-to-day management and technical operations of the Ondo and
Ogun subprojects would be the responsibility of two separate Project Manage-
ment Units (PMU), the managers of which would be responsible to the respective
Chief Conservators of Forests of State MANR's, who in turn would report to
State Permanent Secretaries. The terms of reference for the PMU are set out
in Annex 3.
6.02      The respective MANR's would each establish a "Budget and Policy
Coordinating Committee" (BPCC) that would be responsible for reviewing budget
and policy matters, not only for the forestry project, but also for other
Bank-financed agricultural projects in the respective States. Until now, each
Bank-assisted project in Nigeria has established its own Project Coordinating
Committee to be responsible for overall project policy. However, now that
Bank involvement in the sector is increasing, and with certain States operat-
ing as many as three or four Bank agricultural projects, it is considered
preferable to establish a single common committee for each state. This
approach could avoid duplication of efforts or inconsistencies in decisions
between different projects, and the BPCC is thought more likely to attract
high-level support from the various participating agencies. If the BPCC
establishes itself as an effective body, its role in State policy-making might
eventually be extended beyond Bank-assisted projects alone to become a useful
forum for the formulation of overall State policy for the agricultural sector.
The advisory body to the BPCC would be the existing Planning, Budgeting and
Monitoring Division of MANR. The BPCC would determine common policy issues;
have an overall view of a number of project budgets involving a significant
portion of the State's agricultural allocations; ensure common conditions of
service; award major contracts, etc. The BPCC would comprise the Permanent
Secretary of Agriculture (Chairman), Chief Agricultural Officer, Chief Agri-
cultural Engineer, Chief Conservator of Forests, Chief Agricultural Planning
Officer (CAPO), Project Managers of Bank-assisted projects, a representative



- 25 -
of the Ministry of Finance and Economiic Development, and a representative of
the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (FMAWR). Representa-
tives of other Ministries or agencies would be coopted when required. The
CAPO would be Secretary to the Committee. The terms of reference of the
BPCC are given in Annex 3. A condition of loan disbursement against their
individual State subprojects would be that Ondo and Ogun States had, through
publication in the official gazette, established their respective PMU and
BPCC with terms of reference and composition satisfactory to the Bank.
6.03      To keep the Local Government Councils (LGC) and the local people
informed of the project's activities, each PMU would establish a local
advisory committee once the project is operational.
6.04      The project organization in Ogun and Ondo is shown in Chart IBRD
19309.  The apex of PMU would be the project manager.  Reporting to him would
be four departments:
-    Engineering Services would be responsible for land
clearing, roads, buildings and operation of project
workshops;
-    Plantation Services would be responsible for
nurseries, planting and maintenance and fire
protection;
-    Agricultural Services would be responsible for
mechanized maize operations and supervision of
Taungya farmers; and
-    Finance and Administration would be responsible
for personnel, accounts, stores and procurement.
6.05      In view of the small size and the trial nature of the trial plan-
tation project in Anambra State, it would be implemented by staff of the
Forestry Division of MANR headed by a silviculturist, who would be directly
responsible to the State CCF. The silviculturist would be seconded from FDF
and would also be responsible for other introductory trials in other States.
B.   Staffing
6.06      Key staff for each of the Projects in Ondo and Ogun will total 7
and will include the Project Manager, senior forester, chief engineer, road
and forest clearing engineer, workshop engineer, chief accountant and farm
supervisor. For Anambra, the key staff will be the silviculturist seconded
from FDF's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit and the civil engineer (details are
given in the Project File Supplement 2, Appendix 9, Table 7). Though they are
in short supply, all three States have very capable forestry staff at junior
and middle management level; however, very few senior management staff are
available in Nigeria with relevant background and capability for implementing
plantation development programs of the kind proposed. Except for the chief
accountant, senior foresLer, and civil engineer (Anambra) who can be recruited



- 26 -
locally, the project has provided funds for international recruitment of key
staff. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that persons with qualifica-
tions and experience and on terms and conditions of employment acceptable to
Li,- Bai!K would oe appointed to these posts.  Further, the appointment of the
two project managers in Ondo and Ogun States and the silviculturist in Anambra
State would be conditions of loan disbursement against each individual State
subproject. Due to the shortage in junior and middle level forestry staff,
assurances were obtained at negotiations that respective MANRs would give high
priority to PMU staff recruitment and as far as possible promptly accede to
PMU requests for secondment of technical and other staff to the projects.
6.07      Recruitment of expatriate staff would take place either as estab-
lished for ongoing projects, where the Agricultural Projects Management Unit
for Western Africa (APMU) has assisted the State and Federal Government to
identify and appoint the staff, or through the use of a recognized consultant
firm acceptable to the Bank. In the latter case, contracts made with con-
sultant firms would have terms, conditions and personnel acceptable to the
Bank.
C.   Monitoring and Evaluation
6 08      The State projects would be responsible for monitoring and evalua-
tion and would submit quarterly progress reports to the Bank and FDF. The
format of these reports would be established when project specialist staff
and consultants are appointed.  The projects would specifically monitor the
numerous manual and mechanized plantation operations, including growth rate
and yield, which would greatly benefit the planning of subsequent project
plantation development. Specialist staff from FDF would provide the project
technical support in survey design, data processing and analysis. Through
the monitoring and evaluation process, PMU would prepare the project comple-
tion report.
6.09      One of the main functions of FDF is to provide overall direction
in maximizing Nigeria's forestry exploitation and to provide technical and
financial support to the States. To assist in carrying out this role, FDF
has established a Forest Management Division (Chart IBRD 19310), which is
mainly responsible for monitoring and evaluation of ongoing forestry projects
and planning of the forestry sector, including project preparation. Under
the project, the Division would be strengthened to complement a number of
specialists (mensuration, plantation and natural forest management) provided
by UNDP/FAO assistance (para 4.17). These 5 key staff, forest economist, data
processing analyst, financial controller, silviculturist, and training and
staff development officer would be recruited, with qualifications and experi-
ence and on terms and conditions of employment acceptable to the Bank. As-
surances to this effect were obtained during negotiations. The average
cost of international staff based on standard APMU terms is estimated at
US$5,000 per manmonth.
6.10      The silviculturist's main task would be the establishment of the
tropical pine and eucalypts trial plantation in Anambra and conducting intro-
ductory pine trials in Cross River, Ondo and Ogun States. The other staff



- 27 -
would be responsible for monitoring and evaluating the project components,
assisting State project staff and FDF zonal offices in survey design, data
processing and analysis, and preparing and participating in staff training.
In addition, the forest economist wouild assist FDF in planning and project
preparation; and the financial controller would assist the three subproj-
ects and other FDF-sponsored forestry projects in setting up an accounting
and management reporting system. Together with the UNDP/FAO staff (para
4.17), they would set up and maintain a central data bank of basic planning
and progress information for the entire forestry sector in the country.
VII. MARUKTS AND PRICES
7.01      The recent rapid growth in Nigeria's economy, and particularly in
the construction sector, has led to a very strong domestic market for wood
and wood products, and prices have increased dramatically. As of April 1,
1976, the Government prohibited the export of all wood and wood products.
The demand for the project products (pulpwood and utility saw logs) is good,
and will improve with growing demand and inadequate supplies from the natural
forest.
Roundwood (Logs)
7.02      In 1977, Nigeria's iotal consumption of industrial woo9j and wood pro-
ducts was about 3.1 million m  (r), of which about 2.3 million m  (r) were
domestically produced. The balance was imported, mainly as paper and paper
products.
7.03      Demand for wood and wood products in Nigeria has been forecast
using cross-country F.A.0. studies, 1/ assuming an increase in real per
capita income of 2.5 percent pSr anntmi. Total roundwood demind is expected
to increase from 3 1 million m  (r) in 1977 to 5.7 million m  (r) in 1985,
and 11.7 million m  (r) in 1995.  From this tota   demand, sawlog and peeler
logs aSe expected to increase from 2.3 million m (r) in 1977 to 3.8 mil-
lion m  (r) in 1985, and to 7.0 million m  (r) 3in 1995, whereas pulpwood    3
requirements would increase from 1.8 million m (r) in 1985 to 4.6 million m
(r) in 1995. Domestic production of sawlogs and pulpwood will therefore only
be able to satisfy domestic demand if a large scale plantation program is
started immediately (para 2.20).
7.04      Prices for logs on the free market in Lagos now range from N 50 m3
(r) (US$77) upwards, which would imply an economic value of at least N 20 m
(r) (US$31) for the average type of h,ardwood at the stump (para 8.02). Accord-
ing to the latest Bank forecasts, world prices for tropical hardwoods will in-
crease substantially in the years to come. The expansion of exports from

traditional producing countries is expected to be relatively small and the
growth of import demand is expected to stimulate exploitation of hitherto
untouched forests, where production costs are 50 to 100 percent higher than
those in the current producing regions. The prices of logs are expec-ed tc
increase by about 35 percent from 1978 to 1985. After 1985, real log prices
are expected to increase further at about 3 percent per annum which could
result in a stumpage value of the project's plantation grown logs of over
US$30/m when the first project fellings take place in 1993.
Sawn Timber
7.05      About 90% of Nigeria's industrial roundwood production is used for
sawn timber. The demand for sawn timber increased sharply in response to the
boom in the construction industry, but due to the scarcity Sf sawlogs, pro-
duction of 9awn timber increased only slowly from 950,000 m (s) in 1974 to
1,100,000 m (s) in 1977 (including ouitput of pit sawins). Prices for util-
ity-grade timber th refore rose sharply from N 40 per m  (s) (US$62) in early
1974 to N 140 per m (s) (US$216) at the end of 1975. Since 1976, prices have
stabilized due to the reduced demand following reduction 3of real Government
capital expenditures in 1976, and presently prices per m (s) are around
N 140-16q (US$216-246).  Similar quality3timber in Ivory Coast is priced at
US$120 m  and in Liberia at US$120-150 m
Wood-based Panels
3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
7.06      Nigeria produces about 63,090 m  of plywood annually.  Domestic
consumption in 1973 was only 41,000 m , and the subsequent surge in domestic
demand was partially met by reducing exports. In 1936, Nigeria became a
net importer of plywood and imports reached 12,0003m  in 1977.  The current
ex-mill price varies betw en N 300 and N 470 peK m (US$462-724). In 1977,
Nigeria consumed 75,000 m of plywood, 10,000 m of particle board and 35,000
metric tons of fiber board.  Demand for the latter two products was wholly met
by imports. In the Ivory Coast, plywood sells at about US$300 m ex mill.
7.07      Six plywood and particle board mills are presently under const uc-
tion.  By 1980, Nigeria's total manufacturing capacity will be 110,000 m  of
plywood and 100,000 m  of particle board.  Com0ined domestic demand for these
two products is expected to be about 150,000 m in 1985, so that Nigeria could
again become a net exporter of wood-based panels in the early 1980's.
Pulp and Paper
7.08      Except for 12,000 tons of locally made industrial paper, all paper
and paper products consumed in Nigeria are imported. Total consumption in-
creased from 124,000 tons in 1974 to about 181,000 tons in 1976, valued at
N 100 million. Despite the fact that imports and consumption dropped in 1977,
consumption is expected to increase to 360,000 tons in 1985 and to 900,000
tons in 1995. The value of this if imported would amount to nearly N 200
and N 500 million respectively.



- 29 -
7.09      However, Nigeria is rapidly expanding its paper producing capac-
ity, which is expected to reach 230,000 tons by the early 1980's. Some
pulpwood plantations have been established, but without additional planting,
pulpwood will have to be imported (parl 7.03). Presently, the price for
imported pulpwood is about US$30 per m . The output of the planned paper mills
will be readily absorbed by the domestic market.  The Iwopin Mill at full
production will export surplus pulp to potential markets in Southern Europe
until such time as the internal demand for paper matches supply (1990-1995).
It is estimated that the mill net price of surplus pulp to Southern Europe
would be N 184/air dried ton. The quality of the Gmelina pulp indicates that
it is similar to high grade Scandinavian Birch and at this price it would be
competitive and acceptable in the European market. The newsprint production
of the Itu mill (Cross River State) should reach 100,000 metric ton/year
which is not expected to be totally absorbed by the domestic market until
1988. It is envisaged that the initial surplus would be exported to neigh-
boring countries and possibly to Europe. On an import-substitution basis,
the mill net price for sales in Nigeria might be around N 250/ton. For export
to Ghana and Europe the market would be more competitive and a more realistic
estimate of mill net revenues for these sales would be N 200/ton.
Agriculiural Production
7.10      Nigeria is a net importer of maize.  In 1976, about 10,000 tons
were imported, and in the first 4 months in 1977 alone, imports were about
20,000 tons.  As of April 1978, an import duty of 20% was imposed.  Maize
sells for around N 200 per metric ton in the project area. Based on IBRD
world price forecasts, an economic price for 1985 of N 138 per metric ton
in 1978 constant prices has been estimated. The small amount of maize pro-
duced by the project (1,000 tons per annum) is expected to be easily absorbed
by the domestic market.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Financial Implications to Government
8.01      The financial implications of the project for ONSG and OGSG are
summarized in Annex 2, Table 8. To bring in the full benefits arising from
plantings during 15 years, including capital outlay made during the 5-year
establishment phase of the project, the cash flow has been projected for
an extended period of 30 years. After taking into account the stumpage
fees received from salvage logging, pulpwood and sawlogs 1/, the cumulative
deficit rises to N 33.7 million in FY 1993/94, and a positive cash flow
arises from FY 1994/95 onwards, eliminating the entire cumulative deficit
by FY 1998/99. Annual cash surpluses thereafter average approximately
1/   Based on assumptions in Annex 2, Table 8, footnote 3.



- 30 -
N 8.6 million after meeting all project costs and debt service. Since the
Anambra subproject is experimental in nature and the continuation of plantings
will depend on the outcome of the pine trials carried out during the 5-year
project, no cash flow for ANSG has been made.
Stumpage Fees
8.02      More wood is being removed from Nigeria's natural forests than is
being naturally generated. Thus, Nigeria is consuming its forest capital.
At the same time, future demands require an immediate buildup of this capital
through establishment of plantations. The present State tariff (stumpage)
policies, 3allowing loggers to remove wood at an extremely low price (N 2 to
N 4 pe5 m for m2st High Forest species (para 7.04) which fetch not less than
N 50/m  (US$77/m ) in Lagos) are, therefore, inconsistent with the State plan-
tation development programs, which invest huge sums of money in the effort
to preserve the same resource for the future (para 2.14). The question of
realistic stumpage rates should therefore be reviewed for its implications in
respect not only to overall national forest development, but also to the
financial viability of each individual plantation program. In revising the
stumpage rates for the states, the rates for the plantation produce should at
least recover all plantation costs with a reasonable return on capital (para
4.15d). During negotiations, assurances were obtained that ONSG and OGSG
would establish appropriate plantation stumpage rates, no later than June 30,
1980, to be collected by PMU's in Omo and Oluwa Forest Reserves; and that
these rates would be calculated to ensure an optimum financial rate of return
to the states from project plantations, which in any event should not be less
than 11% per annum in real terms. These stumpage rates would be subject to
periodic review. It is unlikely that an increase in stumpage rates would be
passed on to final consumers, since sawmilling will continue to be profitable,
and present prices fully reflect the competitive supply and demand situation,
and the present levels of trade controls.
IX. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A.   Benefits
9.01      The project would contribute to meeting national objectives of
raising output through efficient utilization of natural resources, protecting
the environment, promoting industrial development coupled with import substitu-
tion, and providing employment to the rural population.
Forest Industries Raw Material
3
9.02      Project output of 2.3 million m   of Gmelina would eliminate import
of 6% of the country's wood requirements between 1995 and 1999. The logs trans-
formed into sawnwood would lead to foreign exchange savings of N 115 million



- 31 -
(US$177 million). 1/ In addition, the thinnings from the sawlog plantations
would become available at a time when the nearby Iwopin pulp and paper mill
would be critically short of pulpwood. Since the most economic alternative
to using Gmelina thinnings would be the importation of pulpwood, the proj-
ect would also lead to foreign exchange savings of US$64 million at today's
pulpwood prices. 2/  During the 5-year development program, salvage logging
would be carried out, producing an estimated 700,000 m of logs, valued at
N 14 million (US$22 million), representing 7% of the sawmill annual input.
Institution Building and Research
9.03      The project would initiate the establishment of large scale mecha-
nized forest plantations in Nigeria, and through the project, Nigeria would
obtain valuable experience in the implementation of such development. At
the same time, by providing technical assistance to the Management Division
of FDF, the Federal planning capacity would be improved. Both benefits are
extremely important at a time when large scale planting programs should be
planned and executed in order to satisfy the prospective demand for wood in
Nigeria.
9.04      The project would also contribute to silvicultural research, both
through the pine and eucalypt trials in Anambra and other States, and through
the provision of technical assistance in this field to the Management Division
of FDF. The pine trials would explore the possibility of growing wood for
long fiber pulp in Nigeria. Nigeria would require about 60,000 metric tons of
long fiber pulp in 1985, and producing this pulp domestically would save an
estimated US$24 million annually in pulp imports. 3/ Silvicultural assistance
to FDF should lead to an improved choice of sites and species for future
planting programs in Nigeria.
Environmental Impact
9.05      Replacement of the low-value logged-over High Forest by plantations
of fast-growing species would maintain the areas under forest cover, thereby
protecting the natural ecosystem. T'he extremely poor quality savannah wood-
land of the Mbanasa area, with its low agricultural potential, would be con-
verted into forest plantation, which would reduce the dangers of imminent
erosion and would improve the natural ecosystem in this area. This project
may also prove to be suitable for introducing the integration of forest
plantations with cattle grazing.
Forest Village Development and Employment
9.06      Forestry management in the past has been dependent on casual labor
of unpredictable reliability. The project will therefore construct permanent
1/   Value US$208/mi3(s) in 1995, with a 37% conversion from round log to sawn
timber.
2/   The project will produce about 2 million m  of pulpwood (1986-1990)
valued at US$32 per m
3/   At an import value of pulp of US$400/ton.



- 32 -
forest villages in the project areas, providing basic social services, and
allocating land around the villages for kitchen gardening for about 1,000
workers and their families. The project will result in a net gain of about
1,500 Government and seasonal forestry workers, and through the related
logging and processing industry, a substantial but unquantifiable number of
other workers.
Food Production
9.07      In a modest way, the project would contribute to increased local
food production through 5,000 Taungya farmers; at the same time, increasing
their annual incomes. The incremental return to the farmer of the crops
produced would be about N 850,000 (US$1.3 million) annually. The annual
value of the mechanized maize grown for animal feedstuffs would be about
N 225,000 (US$346,000).
B.   Economic Analysis
9.08      On the assumptions given below, the ERR for the two main identical
subprojects in Ogun and Ondo States has been estimated at about 13% (Annex
2, Table 9). Due to the experimental and training nature of the Anambra State
subproject, and the lack of positive data on yields, a meaningful ERR for this
subproject as a whole cannot be calculated. However, based on rough estimates
for this type of trial, these activities, if undertaken on plantations of a
commercial nature and scale, could be expected to obtain an economic rate of
return of about 14% (Annex 2, Table 10).
9.09      The economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated on the basis of
incremental costs and benefits. In estimating the ERR, the following assump-
tions and methods were used:
(a) a project life of 30 years for Ogun and Ondo States is
assumed, with plantings continuing to Year 15 and with
saw logs being produced from year 16. For Anambra State,
the ERR has been based on per ha cost and yield data;
(b) project costs are expressed in 1978 values; all
identifiable taxes and duties on goods and services
are excluded; price contingencies are excluded,
but physical contingencies included; for the
opportunity cost of project labor, the market wage
rate of N 2.50 per day has been used; all foreign
exchange costs were adjusted using a shadow exchange
rate 0.8 times the official rate (N 1 = US$1.23);
(c)  import parity prices, based on World Bank forecasts,
wherever possible, have been used in calculating
the economic benefits which are expressed in 1978
constant terms. In estimating the Naira landed value,
the shadow rate of exchange was applied. Short fiber
pulpwood and sawlogs produced by the project are valued



- 33 -
at N 12.7 and N 30 per m  respectively by 1995.  The
value of sawlogs produced during salvage jogging of the
natural forest has been pul: at N 25 per m . Yields of
the Gmelina plantations are assumed to be 75 m per ha
at Yeir 7 in the form of thinnings for pulpwood, and
200 m peS ha at Year 15, of which 100 m are sawlogs,
and 100 m  are pulpwood.  The yield of salvage logging
the natural forest before clearing is assumed to be 30 m
per ha in Ogun and Ondo. M4aize yields from mechanized
cultivation are assumed to be about 2 ton/ha, valued at
N 138/ton; and
(d) unquantifiable benefits from roads and rural infra-
structure and preservation of the natural ecosystems
have been excluded from the calculation of the ERR.
Costs and benefits to Taungya farming are also excluded.
9.10      The Bank is currently reviewing the appropriate shadow exchange rate
and other relevant economic parameters for the economic analysis of projects
in Nigeria. If, for purposes of illustration, the project were analysed with
a shadow exchange rate of Nl.00:US$1.00 (rather than the shadow rate of
Nl.00:US$1.23 used above, or the official rate of Nl.00:US$1.54) the economic
rate of return for Ogun or Ondo wouldL go from 13% to 16%. The use of duties
and quantitative restrictions (includLing outright prohibition) on imports to
protect the balance of payments has increased considerably over the past year.
If Nigeria's inflation continues substantially to exceed the rates prevailing
among its trading partners one may expect either some exchange rate adjust-
ment, or still further increases in trade controls. The latter option would
imply an increasing gap between the shadow exchange rate and the official
rate, which would approximately offset the effects of differential rates of
inflation on the economic rate of return (as would progressive exchange rate
adjustment) .
Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
9.11      Several tests were made to determine the sensitivity of the rates
of return to various alternative assumptions in respect to the Ogun and
Ondo State subprojects. The ERR is not very sensitive to changes in the
assumptions of costs and benefits because of the long gestation period
of the project. A decrease in total benefits of 20% (or an increase in
total costs of 25%) still results in an ERR of about 11%, and the price
of any individual output can be at least 60% below the price assumed in this
report without bringing the ERR below 10%. If no shadow rate of exchange is
applied, the ERR would still be about 11%.  If new planting ceased at the end
of the 5 year project period, instead of continuing for a further 10 years as
assumed, the rate of return would be about 11%. The pilot pine plantation in
Anambra would have a per ha ERR of over 10% even if costs increased by 50%
(or if benefits were reduced by one-third).



- 34 -
9.12      In respect to the technical package, project risks are minimal
since the package has been successfully tested for many years. Physical
risks are those associated with the prevalence of fires, which can seriously
-laly in those plantations being managed for sawlog pro-
duction.  However, the project, through the basic layout of the plantations
and the establishment of fire-fighting units, will greatly reduce this risk.
The financial viability of the project plantations could be jeopardized if
the State Governments fail to increase the present low stumpage rates. How-
ever, present indications that State Governments intend to increase the
stumpage rates are reinforced by the agreements reached during negotiations.
X. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
10.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) ODSG and OGSG would prepare in consultation with FDF
and send to the Bank, not later than March 31, 1980,

project stumpage fees to form a revolving fund, the PMUs
and the FDA would be authorized to establish overdraft
facilities equivalent to six months project expenditure
based on the approved annual project budgets, and that
overdrafts would be guaranteed by the respective State
Governments (para 4.23);



- 35 -

4.23);
(i) PMUs', FDA's and FDF's audited project accounts and the
auditor's reports, including a statement in each case as to
whether or not Bank funds had been used for their intended
purposes, would be submitted to the Bank within four months
