                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was formally restructured in June 2012, which: (i) updated the Project Development Objective (PDO) and results framework to better align with project activities; (ii)
                         extended the project by 18 months to December 31, 2013 to enable completion of activities. Project implementation continues to pick up. Most technical assistance (TA) activities
                         under the first Implementation Plan have been completed, and all twelve TA activities under the second Implementation Plan are under way. Two additional TA proposals on tax
                         administration and centralized procurement were approved in the last quarter of 2012. MDTF 2 is providing relevant support in important areas of reform for better informed policy
