INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RCOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRBCTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO
COLOMBIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed loan to Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Colombia --the Colombian
National Railways-- with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia
for the equivalent of US$25.0 million to help finance a sixth railway
project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including four years
of grace, with interest at 7-1/h percent per annum.
PART I: THE BCONONY
2.         An economic report entitled "Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia" CR73-116), dated May 15, 1973, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 18, 1973. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex I. A review of Colombia's macro-economic performance,
its structural problems and economic policy was contained in the
President's Report on a loan for a Third Education Project (R73-169)
which was approved by the Board on July 17, 1973. The passages concerned
are reproduced in Annex I of this report.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
3.         A description of the Bank's lending strategy in Colombia
was also contained in the President's Report on the Third Education
Loan, and is reproduced in Annex I.
4.         The proposed loan --the fifty-fifth to be made to Colombia--
would bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,073.9
million (net of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, US$855.0
is now held by the Bank.  IDA hade one credit of US$19.5 million
for highways in Colombia in 1961.
5.         Disbursements have been completed on 29 loans and the one
IDA credit. IFC has made effective investments and underwriting
commitments in 19 enterprises in Colombia, totalling about US$20.0
million of which IFC now holds US$8.9 million. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans, the IDA Credit, and IFC invest-
ments as of June 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of the 23 on-
going projects.

PART III: TRANSPORTATION IN COLOM3IA
6.         Colomnbia has the advantage of coastlines on both the
Pacific and the Caribbean but this is offset by the difficulty of
movement between the coasts and the interior. The three'massive
ranges of the Andes Mountains which run from South to North present
formidable barriers to communication between the main areas of
population which until recently developed as separate and almost
isolated communities.  Transport investment policy in the past 20
years has been aimed at national integration and at overccaning the
situation imposed by geography.
7.         Inland communications in Colombia were histor-cally
developed to connect Bogota and Medellin with the Northern Atlantic
ports of Santa Marta, Barranquilla and Cartagena through the
Magdalena River, and Cali with the Pacific port of Buenaventura.
In the last 20 years the original scheme was canpleted by building
railway and highway links to the Atlantic Coast and by improving
connections in the high central valleys between Bogota, Medellin
and Cali. With the trunk system of highways and railway lines,
the basic transport network has been largely completed but substantial
investments will  cortinue to be needed to improve the quality and
increase the capacity of transport facilities.
8.         Total freight traffic, including pipelines (which carried
about 35 percent of total ton km in 1970), has grown at 4.6 percent
per annum between 1965 and 1970 reaching a level of 11.8 billion ton
km. A similar rate of growth is expected through 1975. Road transport
by carrying more than 55 percent o-&' the total (excluding the pipelines)
is the most important transport mode, followed by river transport (17.5
percent) and the railways (i5.5 percent). This interrnodal split has
shifted only slightly towards highways since'9f6i5. It is not expected
to change significantly over-the next 5 years'if proper investments are
carried out in all modes.
9.         The railways carry long haul bulk commodities, and eight com-
modities including wheat, coffee and fertilizers represent about 65 per-
cent of total railway freight traffic. Marginal costs for long distance
freight traffic carried by the railways are estimated at Col$0.25 per
ton km compared with Col$0.42 for trucks.   The railways thus have clear
advantages over compe-ting modes of transport more specifically on the
Atlantic railway and its connection to Medellin, and their traffic should
increase in the futare.  The railways are also serving as an alternative
to river transport on the Magdalena river; low water level in 1973, coupled
with a large increase in export- import traffic resulted in a railway freight



- 3 -
traffic increase of 28.7 percent during the first four months of 1973.
Finally, the railways consume less fuel per ton/km than road users
and this is likely to become significant in the next few years, since
it seems inevitable that by 1975 or 1976 Colombia will have to begin
importing crude petroleum on a substantial scale.
10.        The Government's development program will require further
large investments in the transport sector which will continue to be the
largest recipient of public investment funds. However, the desirable
degree of effective sector investment planning in transportation is
yet far from being achieved. In retrospect, some transport investments
in railways and highways over the last 20 years have been made in a
somewhat unintegrated manner. As in most other countries, transport
coordination has not been very effective and transport investments and
operations have not always reflected coherent sector policies.
11.        The various transportation modes are managed as follows:
the Ministry of Public Works is responsible for the national highway
system and finances construction and maintenance of national roads
through the National Highway Fund. It is also responsible for the
National Feeder Road Fund to which local government bodies also
contribute. Railways and ports are the responsibility of autonomous
agencies under the Ministry, while airports constitute a separate
authority and river transport is private. Pricing policies for the
transport system do not fully reflect economic cost. There are
indications that road users (mainly trucks) are more subsidized than
other modes. The retail price of gasoline in Colombia is still the
second lawest of the world, even after the 45 percent increase in
June 1971. Air services and pipelines seem underpriced.
12.        Although the Bank is placing increasing emphasis in its
lending program on the productive sectors and on investments with more
social benefits it still has an important role to play in assisting the
continuing investments in transportation infrastructure which are neces-
sary to support economic growth in Colombia. In Bank lending for
transportation, the main objectives are: (a) effective planning and
coordination of investment for different transport modes; (b) improved
maintenance and operation policies in both railways and highways; and
(c) better institutional arrangements in both subsectors. An example
of the type of over-all transport planning needed is the Magdalena
River Study which will result in preparation of an investment plan
and pricing policies to promote the optimum development of the various
transport modes in the country's main transport corridor in the Magdalena
Valley.  This study will review the feasibility of extending railway
access to Cartagena and Barranquilla. The study is being carried out



by Dutch consultants and financed by the Netherlands government.
The Colombian authorities have undertaken to consult the Bank on
the conclusions and recornmendations of the Magdalena River Study
and on their implementation; they have also undertaken to employ
the Colombian counterparts working on the study in the Planning
Office of the Ministry of Public Works, after conclusion of the
study.
13.        The Government has become increasingly aware of the
problems of transport coordination and is taking steps needed to
correct the situation. Thus, during negotiations for the proposed
loan, agreement was reached that the Colombian authorities would
centralize in the Ministry of Public Works all of its transport
planning activities.  Bank staff have recently made additional
proposals to the Government on the subject and the Bank intends
to continue the discussion with the Colombian authorities on
transport coordination.
PART TV: THE PROJECT
1a4.       The Bank has made b loans for the railways.   The first
three --made between 1952 and 1960, totalling US$46.3 million--
helped finance the Atlantic line linking Bogota with Santa Marta
on the Atlantic Coast.  The last two loans --US$30 million (1963)
and US$12.4 million (1968)-- were rehabilitation loans which made
an important contribution to dieselization and modernization of
CNR's facilities.  The Atlantic Railroad has hacd an important
impact on the development of the region, by inducing increases in
agricultural production, mainly rice, corn and cattle which were
significant for the national foodstuffs supply; the railroad also
helped promote a major increase in cotton production for export.
T4he Bank-supported rehabilitation programs were generally well
conceived but their implementation and execution were inadequate.
.L,.       The justification of further Bank lending to CNR has
been seriously examined.   The reduced importance of the railways
in the transport sector, the failure in achieving modest financial
targets and. moreover, the poor quality of the railway services
were major problems to be taken into consideration by the Bank
when CNR requested financial support for a very ambitious invest-
ment plan. After a -Protracted analysis, lhe conclusion was reached
that the continuing important economic role for CNR justified a
minimum investmen -olan to defeat the cycle cf deteriorating
infrastructure, derailmie.ts, poor service and loss of traffic.
This is, however, a project that. will require a continuous effort
:in supervision to increase the probability of achieving the



-5-
operational and financial targets proposed. Particularly close
attention will have to be given to management improvement.
16.       The proposed Project consists of a two-year segment
of a railway rehabilitation program, which is part of CNRIs
investment plan for 1973-76, and of a Program of Action.
The Project was first appraised by the Bank in 1971; the ap-
praisal made it clear that the project execution would have to
concentrate on (a) the ability of CNR's management to achieve the
desirable operating targets and financial results (b) the need to
reduce losses on, and ultimately close, certain uneconomic lines
and (c) the need for continued substantial financial contributions
frcm the Government to CNR. These issues were thoroughly considered
by the Government and CNR who agreed in principle with the Bank on
an appropriate course of action for dealing with them. Consequently,
a reappraisal mission visited Colombia in November-December 1972.
Loan negotiations were held in June 1973. The Borrower's delegation
was led by Dr. Alfonso Orduz Duarte, General Manager of CNR, who
also represented the Government. A loan and project summary is
attached as Annex III to this report and an appraisal report (PTR-116c)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Investment Program
17.        The main item in the project is the rehabilitation of
364 km of track and improvements in various sections of CNR's lines.
The total investment related to permanent way, including switches,
track materials and equipment, bridges and ballast cars would
account for 51 percent of the project costs. Other important items
are acquisition of 28 diesel locomotives (24 percent) to be financed
from other sources, consulting services (5 percent), repair of winter
damages (5 percent), spares for freight cars (5 percent) and tele-
communications (3 percent). The 364 km of track to be rehabilitated
under the two year program compares with-I118 kan in 1969, 185 km in
1970 and 225 km in 1971. Due to lack of funds only 60 km were
rehabilitated in 1972. The principal objective is to avoid derailments
which have been reduced significantly on the sections recently
rehabilitated but remain a very serious problem on other portions
of the network because of delayed maintenance combined with difficult
terrain and soil conditions as well as severe seasonal rainfall.
The project comprises those sections most in need of rehabilitation
among the economically viable lines.



18.        The 28 diesel locomotives will replace older types and
allow an increase in total motive power. Freight cars and passenger
coaches are adequate for the foreseeable traffic up to 1976 (except
for ballast cars of which 50 are included in the proposed loan);
spare parts, mainly roller bearings and bogie castings, are needed
and are also included in the loan. Consulting services will be
utilized in the field of management and will continue to be employed
for improving track maintenance and rehabilitation, as well as work-
shops and operations.
Program of Action
19.        The project also includes a Program of Action which forms
part of the Loan Agreement (Schedule 5). The Program co:cnits CNR
to achieve certain specific operational and financial targets in 1973-76,
including steps to be taken with regard to the uneconomic lines. The
Program of Action is described below in paragraphs 20-24.
Uneconomic Lines
20.        After discussion with the Bank, measures have been initiated
under which six uneconomic lines, all of them built before the Bank
started lending to the Colombian railways, totalling 662 km (the total
network is 3,431 k1m) will be closed or have service curtailed. Those
being closed are two lines totalling 117 km (Pereira-Armenia and
Pereira-Manizales), and significant reductions in services and closing
of stations on 4 other lines will be undertaken within the next three
years. The plan will reduce operating costs by about Col$14 million
(US$0.62 million) annually.
Financial Targets
21.        CNR had operating deficits for several years but achieved
operating surpluses (after depreciation but before debt service) in
1966 and 1969. After the latter year, there have again been deficits.
Poor track and operating conditions and a high rate of accidents
aggravated by severe winter damages in 1971-72 and competition fran
roads, have rendered it difficult for CNR to offset rising prices and
increased staff costs by appropriate tariff adjustments. However, an
increase of gasoline prices and progress in ongoing track rehabilitation
allowed some tariff increases to be made in the latter half of 1971 and
1972.
22.        To offset inflationary cost increases and improve its finances,
CNR increased the freight tariff in June 1973 by a further 10 percent (in
current terms). It is likely that additional tariff increases will be
needed over the next few years. The Loan Agreement commits CNR to set
rates at a level sufficient to obtain the operating ratios, set by the
Prngram of Action, i.e. 123, 118, 111 and loh in 1973, 197h, 1975 and



-7-
1976. Staff strength has declined from about 15,000 in 1963 to an
adequate level of 11,400 in 1972; the Program of Action provides for
maintaining staff strength Et about this level through 1976.
Improving Operations
23.        In the operational sphere there has recently been better
performance in track maintenance; together with improved weather
conditions, this has contributed to a reduction in derailments.
CNR's rolling stock is in very good condition and, if properly
utilized on a well-maintained permanent way,could carry substan-
tially more traffic. Relations between management and labor unions
are good. Management has already initiated certain organizational
changes but further efforts could lead to significant improvements,
for example through further delegation of management responsibility
to divisional and departmental levels and a better system of
motivating the staff.
24.        The proposed project provides for continuing assistance
by the consultants who have worked for the last few years at the
operational level with satisfactory results. It also aims at
further improvement of CNR's management by employing management
consultants to carry out an intensive program in this area, including
the study and recommendation of improvements as regards information
to management, management structure and planning activities as well
as personnel administration. The Program of Action includes targets
for such items as the availability of motive power and rolling stock,
loads per freight car and pertrain, turnaround time and reductions
in time for freight delivery between specific points, such as
Santa Marta and Bogota. Provision will be made for an intensified
supervision effort by the Bank through the employment of a consultant
exclusively for this purpose. There appear to be good prospects that
all these measures will reinforce the benefits obtained fram major
investments in track rehabilitation of the project, so as to bring
about significant improvements in operating and financial results
over a two-year period.
Project Costs and Financial Plan
25.        The total project cost, excluding interest during con-
struction, is estimated at US$44.2 million, including local costs
of US$12.0 million and foreign costs of about US$32.2 million.
Total financing required,including interest during construction on
the proposed Bank loan would be US$45.8 million. The proposed
Bank loan would finance the following items:

US$ Million
i.    Rehabilitation of permanent way        13.4
ii.    Parits for rehabilitation of loco-
motivrs and railway cars                3.2
iii.    Telecommunications                      1.0
iv.    Consultants                             1.5
v.    Winter damages                          1.0
vi.    Contingencies and miscellaneous         3.3
Total                            23.4
Interest during construction            1.6
Amount of proposed loan                25.0
26.       The 28 locomotives are to be financed through surp-
pliers' credits amounting to US$6.8 million.   CNR would finance
US$1.6 million from existing inventories (mainly rails). The
remaining US$12.4 million would be covered by the Government budgetary
allocations to CNR.
27.        The loan would be used entirely for foreign exchange
expenditures, except possibly for US$2 million; of this, US$1.h
million would consist of timber sleepers, and US$0.6 million of
minor items (such as structural steel for bridges, nuts and bolts
for rails) for which Colombian suppliers are likely to win the
contracts in international competitive bidding.
The Borrower and its Financial Position
28.        CNR is an autonomous government entity headed by a five-
member Board of Directors with the Minister of Public Works, ex-
officio, as Chairman. The other members represent trade, industry,
banking and agriculture. The General Manager is appointed by the
President of Colombia, as are the Board members. The Board controls
the railways' operating and financial policies, including adjustment
of rates and fares.  However, authority for building or abandonment of
railway lines and changes in personnel service conditions rests with
the Government.
29.        CNR's present financial situation is serious and its
unsatisfactory cash position has resulted in CNR's delaying payments
to suppliers, deferring some debt service payments (not for Bank loans)
and resorting to short-term borrowings at high rates of interest.
With the rate adjustments described in paragraph 22 and control over
staff strength, CNR is expected to achieve an operating surplus by
1977 but meanwhile it would need the assistance of the Government to
meet local currency costs of the investment plan, debt service and



working capital requirements.   The Government has set up a special
fundinto which it has undertaken to make monthly deposits suffic-ent
to maintain in 1973, 1974 and 1975 a balance equal to CNR's peso
reouirements not covered from other sources during the succeeding
3 months.  The first payment into the fund (of Col$45 million) has
already been made. In addition, the Government has assumed the
responsibilit-y for servicing two new loans to CNR: one from a US
commercial bank in the amount of US$20 million to cover external
debt service obligations of C1'R for the next three years, and another
from local banks in the amount of Col$85 million to enable CNR to
pay outstanding short term bank loans and overdue suppliers' bills.
Loan Disbursements and Procurement
30.        The proposed loan would be disbursed according to the
schedule included in Annex III. All goods financed under the loan
would be procured through international competitive bidding except
about US$1.4 million for certain replacement parts for locomotives
which would be procured from the original suppliers.
31.        Colombian firms are not likely to compete except for
timber sleepers estimated at about US$1.4 million and certain minor
items estimated at about US$0.6 million. Local bidders would be
granted a margin of preference of 15 percent or the applicable
customs duty, whichever is lower. In the case of timber sleepers,
however, no preference would be given since local suppliers of
this bulky commodity already have an overwhelming locational
advantage.
Economic Benefits and Rate of Return
32.        The main economic benefits of the project will be obtained
by avoiding further diversion of railway traffic to road and by
reducing derailments. The economic return on the 1973-76 Investment
Plan is estimated at 12 percent. This evaluation does not take into
account benefits to users resulting from improved quality of service.
The successful implementation of the project will depend to a large
degree on lasting improvements in management.
33.        Toward the end of the project implementation period a
new evaluation would be made, in the light of achievements, of whether
to recommend additional Bank financing for the remainder of the
1973-76 investment program of CNR. This two phase approach is being
adcpted in view of the BankTs experience with the earlier railway
projects when results fell short of the original operational and
financial targets.

THE ECONOMY
(Extract from Report and Recommendation of the President to the
Executive Directors on a proposed loan to the Republic of Colombia
for a Third Education Project)
3.        The Colombian economy has showigimpressive gains in the recent
past. The rate of economic growth has accelerated to more than 7 percent
per annum, and the expansion of non-traditional exports has been remark-
able. Such improvements are very much needed in order to accelerate
employment generation. Colombia also needs to spread more widely
benefits from growth in order to surmount problems of poverty and
population pressures in both rural and urban areas. Concentration
of land ownership, technical backwardness and underemployment charac-
terize most rural areas. In urban areas, pressures of population
growth, compounded by heavy migration from the countryside, have
generated serious unemployment. Prospects for coping with these
problems lie in the accelerated growth path upon which the Colombian
economy has recently embarked.
4.        Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural
poverty and urban unemployment in a more systematic fashion than in
the past but much remains to be done. In spite of the passage of an
Agrarian Reform Law in 1961 and the creation of the Agrarian Reform
Institute (INCORA), also in 1961, only modest results have been
achievead in alleviating rural poverty. Recently, additional agricul-
tural legislation has been enacted, enabling a faster advance in land
reform and introducing a tax on presumptive agricultural income. In
recognition of the problems of urban concentration and unemployment
the Government is now placing greater emphasis on urban development,
particularly in the housing field. Through this program it hopes
to stimulate a pattern of demand that will maximize urban employment.
The programs have necessitated and will continue to require a strengthen-
ing of the fiscal effort.
5.       -b During the five-year period 1968-72 current revenues of
the national government have risen at an average of 9 percent per
annum in real terms.  During the past year the National Government,
pursuant to its program announced at the Consultative Group meeting
of February 1972, took new fiscal and other measures which are
expected to raise revenues by Col$1.0 bil'ion per year (6 percent
of the 1972 total revenue). This should enhance its ability to
generate local currency needed to support foreign-assisted projects.
At the latest Consultative Group meeting held in June 1973, members
of the Group expressed the view that growing needs for public invest-
ment and other public expenditures called for further increases in
domestic fiscal efforts. The Government has expressed the intention
to further increase revenues by new tax measures now pending before
the Colombian Congress and by increasing the savings of public enter-
prises. It is also in the process of improving tax administration
which should increase collections. The Bank intends to continue the



Page 4 of 6
6.        Io support the accelerated growth of the economy, measures
have been taken to strengthen the export sector and thereby reduce
the foreign exchange constraint to sustained growth.   A substantial
measure of success in this area has been achieved through policies
to encourage non-traditional exports. These have continued to grow
rapidly and their total value approached the value of coffee exports
in 1972. Although Colombia has not yet surmounted its dependence on
coffee, the rapid growth of non-traditional exports, if continued,
should achieve this result in the foreseeable future. Merchandise
export earnings during the past year exceeded US$800 million, and
were some US$150 million above the preceding yearts export earnings.
Net international reserves of the Bank of the Republic doubled in
1972 as a result of growth in exports, and reached US$345 million
by year end. Since then, they have grown to US$437 million. This
provides an import coverage of about 5 months. In order to preserve
the gains already achieved and to sustain the process of rapid
diversification by expanding both agricultural and industrial exports,
it is particularly important that Colombia continues its policy of
frequent exchange rate adjustments. The Government has declared its
intention to do so.
7.        The strong growth in GDP has been accompanied by upward
pressure on prices. Contributing to this pressure has been central
bank lending to finance part of a 30 percent real increase in
government investment during 1972. High coffee prices also
increased demand, and there is evidence that the export boom re-
duced the supply of some commodities, e.g. beef, on the domestic mar-
ket while the rise in smport prices was an additional important factor.
As a consequence consumer prices are estimated to have risen by
some 11.4 percent in 1971 and 13.5 percent during 1972, as compared
with a 7.5 percent average increase for the 1967-70 period.   Infla-
tionary pressures have continued to accelerate during the first few
months of this year. The authorities are aware of the danger this
presents and the fiscal measures referred to in paragraph 5 should
bring about some improvement. Further action is also being under-
taken, such as the issuance of special bonds to reduce excess
liquidity resulting from the boom in coffee exports. Another anti-
inflationary measure placed into effect was a substantial liber-
alization of imports.
8.        The public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.2 billion at the end of 1972, or US$1.4 billion
excluding undisbursed commitments. Service on this debt is not
high (14.8 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1972), relative
to many other developing countries. Since exports have risen at
the same rate as debt service in recent years, there has been no
increase in the debt service ratio, at a time when economic growth
has accelerated. The debt service ratio may be expected to rise
to about 20-21 percent in 1977-78 as a result of greater capital inflows
associated with a sustained high growth rate. Should economic growth
continue at a rapid pace which appears feasible, and should that growth
be accompanied by a further strong expansion of non-coffee exports and
sound economic and financial policies, Colombia should find it possible
to aecure the large amrounts of external capital it needs and to manage
servicing the indebtedness that this volume of borrowing would generate.
Some of this capital will have tobe provided to finance local costs
if foreign assistance is to make a significant contribution to projects
of high priority such as those in the social sectors, with a low foreign
exchange component.

BANK LENDING STRATEGY IN COLOMBIA
(Extract from Report and Recommendation of the President to the Executive
Directors on a proposed loan to the Republic of Colombia for a Third
Education Project)
..................................
11.       Bank disbursements as a percentage of total disbursements by
official lenders to Colombia are expected to peak at about 40 percent in
1973-74 and then decline. The Bank's share of total debt service is
projected to peak at about 31 percent in 1974-75, and the Bank group
share of total debt disbursed and outstanding can be expected to fall
from 28 percent in 1972 to 24 percent in 1978.
12.       Over the past few years, Bank lending in Colombia has become
increasingly diversified as activitie!s have expanded and as the Bank
assumed greater responsibilities as head of the Consultative Group for
Colombia. Increasingly, projects involving Bank loans in agriculture,
industry and the social sectors were developed. While so far our efforts
in these sectors have been mainly production-oriented in support of
economic growth and related export expansion objectives, we are now seeking
to develop projects in such a way as to combine increasing output with
maximum benefits in terms of employment and improving the income of the
poor, particularly in rural areas. Such a further shift in emphasis of
Bank lending, however, will require a new approach in many instances and
hence project preparation and appraisal are likely to be more time-
consuming. Also, at least in the initial stage, such projects are likely
to be of much smaller size than the traditional large infrastructure projects.
13.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing
contribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with perhaps as
much as 60 percent of our total lending, in those two sectors.
14.       The other major focus of our activities would be in such social
sectors as education and water supply, as well as in other project areas
such as the traditional sectors of Bank lending --electric power and
transportation-- in cases where support can be given to strengthening
institutional development. In addition the Bank would continue to cooperate
with the Government in its efforts to improve the fiscal system and in
developing institutions capable of increasing public savings.
15.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in (Annex
I, page 6). While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-fifths of total
external financing to Colombia in the 1961-71 period, their share decreased
to 53 percent in 1972. This results from unusually low IBRD lending in that
year as well as from recent medium and long-term borrowing abroad from
commercial banks and bond issues on an unusually large scale. The IDB has
assisted projects in low-cost housing, university education, agrarian reform,
ports, electric power, water supply, transportation, and industry. AID has
shifted the emphasis of its lending in recent years from program to sector
loans, particularly for education, urban development, and agriculture.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
fully disbursed:
Loan 502 - Irrigation (Atlantico I), US$9 million, June 1967.
Implementation of the project financed under loan 502-CO remains
two years behind schedule due to difficulties in the selection of
areas suitable for irrigation and technical problems in the
construction of major irrigation and drainage works. As a
consequence of this and poor project management, agricultural
development is still limited to a small area and mainly
restricted to dry farming. However, the few agricultural results
obtained on a small numbor of farms are very promising. To complete
the scheduled works, a second extension of the closing date by one
year beyond the revised closing date of December 31, 1973 may become
necessary.
Loan 53  - Development Finance Companies II, US$12.5 million, May 1968.
This loan is fully committed for approved sub-projects, and the
undisbursed balance of Us$0.3 million is expected to be disbursed
shortly.
Loan 536 - Water Supply (Bogota I), US$14 million, June 1968.
The major part of the First Bogota Project is in operation.
Water service in most areas with poor service is rapdily improving
The operating performance of the Empresas is good and the remaining
works should be completed by the end:of 1973. The Closing Date has
been prolonged to June 30, 1974 to permit completion of the project
and payment to suppliers.
Loan 537 - Electric Power (Bogota), US$18 million, June 1968.
The project financed by this loan is substantially completed. Lower
than anticipated participation of joint financing agencies together
with foreign cost increases due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar
led to a re-allocation of funds in mid-1972 among the loan categories.
Delays in the definition of the distribution expansions have caused
late bidding for distribution equipment. The Closing Date has been
extended to the end of 1973 to allow completion of the project.
2/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



Page h of 7
Loan 550 - Highways V, US$17.2 million, July 1968.
There have been substantial cost overruns and delays in the civil
works financed under this loan. The project is about 90 percent
complete; the present closing date of June 30, 1973, already
postponed for one year from the original, will be postponed
for one more year.
Loan 552 - Education I, US$7.6 million, July 1968.
School construction is virtually completed. All furniture and
75 percent of the equipment has been delivered to the schools
and procurement of the remainder is under way. However, procure-
ment of furniture and equipment is considerably behind schedule
and this is reflected in slower than expected disbursement.
Improvement is expected now that the procurement unit has been
strengthened.
Loan 575 - Electric Power (Interconnection), Us$18 million, December 3.968.
The project as originally described in the Loan Agreement
started operation in November 1971. Mainly due to the fact that
the joint financing arrangements raised more funds than expected
during the appraisal, the 230 KV line Guatape-Barrancabermeja,
which will incorporate the northeastern region into the inter-
connected system, was included in the loan. Completion of the
extension is ssnheduled by mid-1974.
Loan 624 - Agricultural Credit II, US$17 million, June 1969.
The Project continues to be far behind schedule. However, recent
changes in Project management and organization and an increase in
technical personnel provided the basis of the Bank's approval of
Colombia's request to enlarge the Project area and include lending
to small farmers under the Project. The Project has now begun to
move fairly well.
Loan 625 - Developmtent Finance Companies III, US$25 million, June 1969.
US$24.9 million of this loan is committed for approved sub-projects.
To permit completion of disbursements the Bank has agreed to extend
the original Closing Date from September 30, 1972, to December 31,
1973.
Loan 651 - Livestock II, US$18.3 million, December 1969.
This Project moved slowly from effe.ctiveness in March 1971 until
mid-1972. in October 1972, the Bank and Caja agreed on certain
modifications to tho Project, including appointment of one Project
General Director with overall responsibility for the Project,
extension of the Project area and greater flexibility in regard to
terms of sub-lending. At the same time it was agreed that increased
sub-lending should be directed towards small holders. These changes
have resulted in an increase in the rate of sub-lending under the
Project and it is now expected that the Loan will be fully disbursed
by mid-1976.



ANNEX II

Loan 679 - Education II, US$6.5 million, June 1970.
All major civil works for five of the nine project schools had been
completed at the time of the last supervision mission in December
1972 and the remaining four were expected to be completed by mid-
1973. There has been some delay in project execution owing to slow
procurement of furniture and equipment. Improvement is expected now
that the procurement unit has been strengthened. The Closing Date
was recently postponed by one year to June 30, 1974.
Loan 680 - Highways VI, US$32 million, June 1970.
In general, there have been substantial cost increases and serious
delays on the civil works.' The most serious problem confronting
the project relates to the financial difficulties of the Colombian
contracting industry, leading to a temporary halt in construction
on several groups of the Paving Program. In this situation, where
some of Colombia's major contracting firms were facing bankruptcy,
the Government has recently taken drastic steps to resuscitate
operations. Estimated cost increases for civil works now amount to
about 30 percent of original contract amounts, while consultant
services will be about double the original amount.  Civil works
are nearly 40 percent completed, but are about one year behind
schedule. The situation is more satisfactory on the other two elements
of the project, the construction of the Barranquilla bridge and of
the El Pailon-Buenaventura road.
Loan 681 - Electric Power (Chivor I), US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Progress of the main civil works contract is generally satisfactory
and in agreement with the contractual dates. Bidding for the rest
of the civil works financed by the Bank is proceeding as planned.
Higher than expected prices for equipment, due partly to the
revaluation of various European currencies and the yen, together
with changes in the access road program, have substantially increased
the total cost of the project. Recently we have received a revised
cost estimate and as of March 1973 total project costs are estimated
at US$140 million, that is, about US$25 million more than estimated
in the Appraisal Report. ISA plans to finance the cost overruns with
unallocated funds of the IBRD and the IDB loan and with suppliers
credit and a direct loan from a group of foreign banks. The Bank
has reassessed the economic and financial viability of the project
in view of the cost overruns and found that Chivor I remains the
best alternative.
Loan 682 - Cali Water Supply and Sewerage, US$18.5 million, June 1970.
The project was delayed for about one year due mainly to a change
in the Cali Municipal Government that occurred after theloan was
signed. The Board of EMCALI has appointed a new manager and taken
remedial actions suggested by the Bank in order to improve EKCALI's
administrative capacity and financial performance.



.I'4I  DA   - -

Loan 738 - Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage, US$2 million, May 1971.
Construction on this project was delayed due to slow project
design and administrative problems with the consultants and the
Borrower. Lower than anticipated sales of water and a shortfall
in projected local borrowing has resulted in an unsatisfactory
financial performance of the Borrower. As a consequence the Bank
has proposed to Empresas Publicas Municipales the rephasing of the
project to reflect the above mentioned financial constraints.
Loan 739 - Land Settlement Caqueta I, US$8.1 million, May 1971.
During its first year, the project has achieved about 75 percent
of its appraisal objectives. Sublending is being delayed by
administrative procedures associated with cattle purchase and
the provision of technical assistance. Arrangements have been
made to improve the organization, and there are prospects that
1973 operations will be on target. The benefits from the project
are likely to be higher than appraisal projections while the cost
estimates are likely to be about the same as envisaged at appraisal.
Loan 740 - Telecommunications II, US$15 million, May 1971.
The recent currency revaluations have caused an estimated cost
overrun of US$2 4 million. The Bank and the Borrower are considering
various alternatives of financing this overrun.
Loan 741 - Water Supply (Bogota II), Us$88 million, May 1971.
The principal civil works component of this project, the Chingaza
tunnel construction, is behind schedule. The Borrower is reviewing
the latest measures proposed by the contractors to improve performance.
Recent information shows that revenue from water sales is lower than
forecast. The Bank has suggested actions to assure that this short-
fall will not adversely affect the financial performance of the
Borrower which has been satisfactory hitherto.
Loan 742 - Development Finance Companies IV, US$40 million, May 1971.
Only US$0.7 million of this loan remain uncomnitted. Disbursements
are ahead of schedule.
Loan 842 - Development Program and Expansion Project, US$60 million, June 1972.
The second tranche (US$30 million) of this loan was cancelled
because coffee prices exceeded the upper limit set in the Loan
Agreement for release of the second tranche.

Loan 849 - Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June'1972.
This loan becane effective on Novenber 14, 1972.
Loan 860 - Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project, US$9.1 million,
October 1972.
This loan became effective on March 7, 1973. The Borrower has
experienced diffi-c-uties-in the initial phase of±the project; 'however,
the recent stationing of a Bank water supply specialist in Bogota -_
is helping solve these problems.'--Construction of-several subprojects
has recently' begun.-
Loan 874 - Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project, US$56 million, January 1973.
Construction of the Santa Rita dam (2nd stage) has started.
