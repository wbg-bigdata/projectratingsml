PREFACE
This Project Implementation Plan was prepared during pre-appraisal and appraisal
missions in May and June/July 1995 and discussed with the Ministry of Finance
during these missions and subsequent, post appraisal briefings. The World Bank
project team was led by Mr. Hiran Herat and included Messrs. Craig Neal,
Stanislas Balcera, Hemant Shah and Ms. Yvonne Jones. This document reflects
the helpful comments and generous assistance by many Croatian and other
country counterpart. Most notably, it reflects the close collaboration and support
of the Assistant Minister of Finance of the Republic of Croatia, Mrs. Ljerka
Ercegovic as well as the active participation and encouragement of the Minister
of Finance, Mr. Bozo Prka.
By consolidating the design and planning work for the project, as well as the
terms of references for the technical assistance contracts, this plan will serve as
a reference for all key project activities by current and future project participants.
This, the authors hope, will provide greater coherence and continuity of actions
over the project period. Although the plan cannot provide exhaustive detail on all
project activities, it is sufficiently detailed to remain a working document for the
duration of the project. Thus, the project implementation team is strongly
encouraged to update and revise the plan to reflect work accomplished and
further refinements in the project design and schedule.

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  --1 --       Project Implementation Plan
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Capital Markets Development Project
Project Implementation Plan
(PIP)
-THE PROJECT --
Project Objectives
1.    The overall aim of the Capital Markets Development Project is to support the
Govemment of the Republic of Croatia's economic transformation programs, by
facilitating the privatization and restructuring processes and, more generally,
developing the capital markets institutions required for a modem market-based
economy. In particular, the Govemment wants to strengthen:
a.    the policy framework for the capital markets, especially the regulation
of securities markets;
b.    the operational capabilities of key capital markets entities, especially
the securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement functions;
c.    the public's comprehension of the capital markets and their roles as
shareholders.
Project Description
2.    The Capital Markets Development Project will provide technical assistance,
training, information technologies and various office-related equipment and resources.
The total cost of the Project is US$21.0 million equivalent, including physical and
price contingencies, taxes and duties, and recurrent expenses for the three and one
half years of the project. The World Bank will finance US$9.5 million equivalent of
investment expenditures. The Project will be implemented over a period of four years
under the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), in collaboration
with the securities "depository" (VVS), the Institute for Payment Transactions (ZZPP),
Ministry of Privatization (MOP) and the Republic Fund for Pension and Disability
Insurance of Workers in Croatia (the "Pension Fund", for brevity).



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 2 --   Project Implementation Plan
3.    The Project focuses on a few key initiatives in three basic project components.
a.    Policy Support
i.    regulatory and organizational development of the Croatian
Securities and Exchange Commission (CROSEC);
ii.   technical assistance on the conversion of illiquid govemment
debt instruments into tradeable securities;
iii.   technical assistance on portfolio management to the asset
holding arm of the Pension Fund.
b.    Infrastructure Development:
i.    design, development and implementation of securities
depository, registry, clearing and settlement facilities (WS),
including a program to immobilize existing physical certificates
and secure existing share registries;
c.    Public Awareness:
i.    mass media development (television, radio and print media);
ii.    mass media campaign ("air' time, printing and distribution).
-- IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS --
Organizations Responsible for the Project
4.    The Ministry of Finance will administer the funds under the Project and
coordinate project activities through a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The PIU will
be headed by a full time Project Implementation Officer with extensive project
management experience. In addition, the MOF will organize a Project Steering
Committee with representatives from the major participants in the Croatian capital
market. The Committee will advise the MOF on matters of substance and priority
which the PIU and the project teams will bring to it (in coordination with the PIU).
5.    The MOF will establish three teams to implement the various project
components. (Figure 1 on page 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.)
a.    Policy Support. A MOF team, headed by the Assistant Finance
Minister, will coordinate the policy support activities, with participation
by staff from the Ministry of Justice, the National Bank of Croatia,
Ministry of Privatization, the Pension Fund, the banking, brokerage and
enterprise sectors, as well as foreign consultants. This team will focus
on the legislative and regulatory policy issues in the capital markets
and the establishment of CROSEC. A smaller technical assistance
effort will be directed at converting certain illiquid government debt
instruments into tradeable securities and at strengthening the portfolio
management capacity of the Pension Fund.
b.    Infrastructure Development. A second team will include personnel
from VVS and ZZPP, and will have the assistance of foreign
consultants. The team will coordinate closely with representatives
from key private sector entities, such as the Zagreb Stock Exchange,
the Broker's Association, commercial banks, the Varazdin OTC



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 3 --   Project Implementation Plan
market, and corporations, as well as with key public sector entities,
such as the Pension Fund. This team will focus on the development of
the securities depository, clearing and settlement facilities as well as
strengthening the linkages between the depository and selected capital
market entities, such as the exchanges, brokers, etc.
c.    Public Awareness. The Public Relations Unit of the Ministry of
Privatization, headed by its assistant minister and supported by a team
of public relations professionals, will manage the public awareness
component. This effort will draw on a variety of agencies in the capital
markets to define the substantive message, and on local mass media
organizations and professionals to refine the strategy and select the
most effective media vehicles.
Agreements Between the Borrower and Implementation Agencies
6.    The Borrower is the Republic of Croatia, represented by its Ministry of
Finance.
7.    The Loan finances, among other things, the development of securities
depository, registry, clearing and settlement facilities (the "depository", for brevity).
These facilities currently exist as a registered legal entity with both public and private
equity capital: WS. However, they must be developed and made operational.
8.    To avoid the delays and risks of building the administrative apparatus from
scratch, as an interim measure, the Government has decided to utilize the
administrative and technical resources of the Institute for Payment Transactions
(ZZPP) to make the depository operational. However, to preserve and extend the
capital markets' oversight of the critical depository function, WS will retain its legal
and financial identity. During the initial development phase, a formal contract
between WS and ZZPP will govern ZZPP's responsibilities, resource contributions
and how those contributions will be reflected in WS's capitalization and governance.
Details of these arrangements will be based on a strategic analysis of the securities
depository, registry, clearing and settlement functions in the Croatian context. (See
Annex D on page 45 for a description of this analysis.)
9.    To ensure long term, private sector oversight of WS, the MOF will seek
majority private sector shareholding of WS at the earliest possible date. The timing
of the privatization will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) the scope of
WS's responsibilities (as determined through the strategic analysis); (ii) the speed
and cost of the development and implementation work; (iii) the strength of private
sector entities in the capital markets; and (iv) the evolution of the demand for WS
services. Given the transitional environment of the Croatian economy, these factors
have a high degree of uncertainty. Nevertheless, an operational depository with an
initial business record will emerge by the end of the project period and provide a
concrete basis for the Government to formulate its privatization plans.

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 5 --    Project Implementation Plan
10.   Notwithstanding the Government's objective to privatize VVS, it will have
to assess what, if any, public service functions VVS will undertake and how
these will be reflected in VVS funding and governance. Specifically, during the
initial phases of corporate privatizations as well as the subsequent rationalization
of enterprise ownership, VVS will perform a major public service by lowering the
risk of misadministration of the depository functions, by, among other things,
economizing on scarce supervisory resources. Given the public's limited
understanding of capital markets and their not altogether benign experiences with
the formal financial sector (e.g., the so-called "Frozen Deposits"), lowering these
risks is critical for the viability of the capital markets and, consequently, for the
privatization program and the overall economic transformation. Once this
transition period has given way to more stable and conventional securities trading
patterns, however, VVS will face a significantly different demand for its services.
11.   Given the unavoidable uncertainty over the evolution of the demand for
trading and shareholder services, as well as the costs of operating VVS in the
post-transition period (i.e. after project completion), the Government will have to
determine what, if any, continued public financial support it will provide to VVS
and how this will be reflected in VVS's governance arrangements. The strategic
analysis for the depository functions includes the formulation of a business and
financing model to assist the authorities in these decisions. The project also
provides support for a privatization plan for VVS (most likely to be undertaken
during the last year of the project).
1 2.   The privatization plan must address, among other things, the fact that the
depository's functional requirements and most appropriate institutional
arrangements will change over time. For example, although the preliminary
design anticipates a centralized depository, with securities accounts tracked to
the final customer level (i.e., a one tier, "single vault" architecture), this design
reflects the current weakness of alternative institutions in Croatia and the fragility
of the public's confidence in the formal financial system. In a few years time, an
increase in the capacity of banks and brokers to offer high fidelity depository,
registry, clearing and settlement services and the public's greater familiarity with
capital markets will open the possibility to move to a more distributed, multi-tier,
multi-vault depository architecture. At this stage, and as part of the privatization
process, VVS could be required to achieve financial self-sufficiency (if it had not
already). In turn, full cost recovery may lead to the then infrequently and closely
traded securities devolving to banks and brokers for depository services. VVS
may then refocus on the accounts of the direct market participants (brokers,
dealers, banks and institutional investors) and on a smaller number of key publicly
traded securities. The strategic decisions, such as whether or not to distribute
the depository functions, will require careful monitoring of evolution of the
market, by CROSEC, the MOF, the National Bank of Croatia and other key capital
markets policy makers. Also, such changes are likely to require revisions to the
legal and financial arrangements of VVS. The privatization plan will need to
address these issues as well as the appropriate regulatory structures to ensure
that the public interest is properly served.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 6 --  Project Implementation Plan
Responsibilities of Implementing Agencies
13.   The Project Implementation Officer, under the supervision and guidance of
the Deputy Minster of Finance, will take overall responsibilities for the functions
of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). The responsibilities of the PIU Head
(supported by two staff: a procurement and a disbursement specialist), are
described in Terms of Reference #10 in Annex J (page 65). These include:
a.    Coordinate day-to-day implementation of tasks under the project by
the various implementing teams and agencies, as specified in the
Project Implementation Plan (PIP).
b.    Organize monthly meetings with the various project component
teams and the Project Steering Committee, to review progress on
project implementation. Organize and circulate agenda and other
communications for the Committee. Record the minutes of these
meetings. Convey the minutes to the MOF and, in English, to the
World Bank and USAID.
c.    Ensure that the Project Steering Committee, sub-committees,
evaluation committees and the project teams have the necessary
knowledge and expertise to conduct their work, including, for
example to draft technical specifications and evaluate technical bid
proposals. Procure necessary ad hoc TA to support these project
groups. Also help organize study tours for selected group members
as appropriate.
d.   In accordance with World Bank Procurement Guidelines:
Consolidate requests for procurement of goods and services.
Prepare, in conjunction with project teams, procurement
documents (e.g., invitations to bid, standard bid documents,
technical specifications, bid clarification, bid evaluation reports,
etc.). Obtain timely MOF approval for procurement documents.
Obtain timely World Bank no-objections for procurement
documents. In conjunction with the project teams, organize and help
manage bidder conferences. In due time for bid evaluations,
organize and support evaluation committees (as appropriate,
economize evaluation efforts by identifying standing members to
serve on various evaluation committees under the project). Chair
evaluation committees. Ensure proper documentation of
committees' deliberations and findings. Ensure timely MOF
approval of evaluation committees' recommendations (including, as
appropriate, Steering Committee review) and of prospective
contracts. As delegated by the MOF, sign contracts. Coordinate
and manage contract awards. Track progress of procurement
activities against the plans set forth in the PIP. Highlight variations
in progress, record reasons and identify remedial actions. Prepare
and submit for Bank review periodic procurement progress reports.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 7 --   Project Implementation Plan
e.    Manage disbursement processes. In conjunction with the MOF and
the National Bank of Croatia, establish and manage the project
Special Account (including the preparation of account statements).
Process loan disbursement applications. Verify disbursement
information in signed contracts against Loan Agreement (the
disbursement schedule and disbursement letter). Prepare
withdrawal applications and obtain authorizing signature from MOF
(or of designated persons including, as appropriate, the PIU Head).
Arrange payments for against statement of expenses (SOEs).
Track disbursements of the Bank loan and government funds.
Monitor project expenditures and costs (local and foreign).
f.    Prepare and distribute consolidated, periodic reports of the project
teams and consultants to the relevant government and other
participating institutions, including the semi-annual and annual reports
to the World Bank, reflecting: (i) the status of implementation progress,
problems encountered, corrective actions needed, rationale for
actions; and (ii) current costs of each project component and
estimated costs of completion.
g.    As required, take actions to expedite project activities, including, but
not restricted to, decision-making and document processing by the
relevant govemmental agencies. Monitor official documents and
contracts as they pass through the approval processes.
h.    In a timely fashion, prepare and submit to relevant government
institutions and the Bank of annual audit reports of project
expenditure and accounts.
i.    Ensure accurate and timely compilation of project indicators by each
implementation team.
Facilitate the preparation of the World Bank standard Project
Completion Report (PCR).
k.    Carefully manage the records and official documents of the project.
14.   The MOF will also establish a Project Steering Committee, with
representation of major participants in the capital markets. The responsibilities of
the Committee are described in TOR #11 in Annex K (page 71). These include:
a.    Review materials and presentations by the various project teams,
consultants and suppliers (as coordinated by the PIU). Assess the
validity of analyses and the appropriateness of the proposed
strategies and action plans.
b.    Actively participate in any necessary work to revise and refine the
proposals and action plans.

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 9 --   Proiect Implementation Plan
-- PROJECT FINANCING AND COSTS --
Financing Plan
17.   The proposed Bank loan of US$9.5 million equivalent will finance 46.4
percent of the total project costs, which comprise 51.3 percent in foreign
exchange costs (US$10.5 million equivalent) and 43.3 percent in local costs,
excluding taxes (US$8.9 million equivalent). USAID will provide about
US$1.1 million equivalent in foreign technical assistance. The MOF will finance
the balance of project costs (about US$9.9 million equivalent), including duties
and taxes which are estimated at US$1.1 million equivalent. Recurrent
incremental costs, which comprise equipment operations and maintenance,
facilities service costs and incremental staff costs (US$5.9 million equivalent),
will be financed entirely by the Government. The financing plan is shown in
Tables 2 and 3 on the next page.
Project Costs
18.   Table 4 on page 11 shows total project costs, by project component and by
expenditure category. Total costs are investment plus recurrent costs for the project
period. These are estimated as base costs, plus physical and price contingencies,
plus taxes and duties. Specifically:
a.    Base Costs. Base costs were estimated in June 1995, using the
experience of other World Bank projects in the region, similar activities
in neighboring countries and detailed input from various Croatian
counterparts. ( See Annex M page 89 for the detailed estimates).
b.    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency for
unforeseen physical variations (US$1.7 million) equivalent to
10 percent of the base cost of all project items. The following rates
were used to cover expected price escalation: local costs 2.6 percent
for CY95-98; foreign costs 2.6 percent for CY95-98.
c.    Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is
estimated at about US$10.5 million including contingencies, or
51.3 percent of total project cost. Calculations of the foreign exchange
component were derived from an item-by-item analysis.
d.    Customs, Duties and Taxes. Goods and external services to be
purchased under the Project will be exempt from taxes and duties.
Taxes and duties for civil works and local technical assistance are
estimated at 10 percent. Therefore, project costs include an estimated
US$1.1 million equivalent in direct and indirect taxes and duties on
goods and services, to be financed by the Government.
19.   About US$5.9 million equivalent is required to cover incremental operating
costs directly attributable to the Project during the April 1996 to December 1998
period. These consist of incremental operation and maintenance expenditure for
equipment, facilities related charges and incremental staff.

Note:  Numbers may not add up due to rounding.
Other includes: Bank-financed consulting services and training to be procured in accordance with Bank
Guidelines for Use of Consultants, with an aggregate amount of US$5.6 million; International Shopping for small
amount of goods for which the cost of ICB outweighs the any possible price advantages will be used with
contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million; and prudent
National Shopping will be used for sundry items not exceeding US$25,000 per contract, up to an aggregate
amount of US$75,000.
Direct Contracting for proprietary, time critical or special compatible equipment may be used subject to Bank prior
review and up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000.
21.    Procurement of Goods.  Equipment contracts which are estimated to cost
more than US$200,000 equivalent per contract will be procured following
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" January 1995.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 13 --  Project Implementation Plan
Equipment (2 major packages) have been be packaged according to related
specialized fields. Equipment procured through ICB (US$2.7 million equivalent)
will account for about 90.5 percent of the total Bank-financed equipment value
(US$3.0 million equivalent). The remaining 9.5 percent of the Bank-financed
equipment value will be in packages suitable for procurement other than ICB. In
the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through ICB, local
manufacturers, which have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and
the Bank that: (i) labor, raw materials and components form within the country
of the Borrower will account for more than 30 percent of the EXW price of the
product offered, and (ii) the production facility in which the goods will be
manufactured or assembled has been engaged in manufacturing/assembling such
goods at lease since the time of bid submission, would receive a preference in an
amount equal to: (i) the amount of duties and other related import charges which
a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importation of the goods
offered; or (ii) 1 5 percent of the CIF or CIP bid price of such goods if said duties
and charges exceed 1 5 percent of such price. Appropriate Bank standard
bidding documents will be used for procurement of goods and equipment. (The
General Procurement Notice (GPN) for the project appeared in the September 19,
1995 edition of Development Business Forum.)
22.   Methods other than ICB are:
a.   International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for small
amounts of equipment where the cost of ICB would clearly
outweigh possible price advantages. Contracts for equipment
estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract, not to
exceed an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million equivalent, will be
awarded under international shopping procedures, based on
comparing price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers
from two eligible countries, in accordance with Bank procurement
guidelines.
b.    National Shopping (NS). Minor sundry items, such as small lots of
information technologies and office equipment, not exceeding
US$25,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of
US$75,000 equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of prudent
national shopping by comparing price quotations obtained from at
least three local suppliers, in accordance with Bank procurement
guidelines.
c.    Direct Contracting (DCJ. Goods and technical licenses which the
Bank agrees: (i) are of proprietary nature; lii) the timely supply
thereof is critical for efficient project execution; or (iii) need to be
compatible with other installed equipment, up to an aggregate
amount of US$100,000 equivalent, may be procured through direct
negotiations with property and/or copyright owners, on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank. Such items include contracts
for intellectual property such as books, technical journals, training
materials, audio-visual materials, computer applications software,
including annual upgrading and licensing arrangements, copyrights,



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   -- 14 -                 Project Implementation Plan
translation and reprinting rights for training materials. Prior Bank
review is required for all direct contracting.
d.      Civil Works (CW). Civil works to upgrade facilities to
accommodate the offices and information systems coming under
the project represent an estimated value of US$0.7 million
equivalent. These will be financed entirely by the Government.

24.    Technical Assistance. Qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals
for technical assistance described in the TORs in Annexes A, and E, F, G, H and 1
in accordance with the 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency", August 1981. (TA
described in Annexes B, C and D will be funded by USAID and procured
according to USAID procedures.) To keep the evaluation process manageable, no



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   -- 15 --         Project Implementation Plan
more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited from a short list
acceptable to the Bank. It is anticipated that Bank-financed technical assistance
will be procured in five packages at a total cost of US$4.9 million equivalent. As
needed, the services of individual specialists (mainly for ad hoc advisory services
to the project teams) will also be contracted on the basis of short lists of eligible
candidates. It is anticipated that about US$0.6 million equivalent of the
aggregate for technical assistance would be for individual specialists. Travel and
subsistence relating to: (i) study tours to support the project teams and (ii) staff
and management development under the institutional development programs are
an estimated US$0.7 million equivalent.

Bank review periodic procurement progress reports.
27.    Bank Review. For goods and works, the Bank shall review the Borrower's
procurement decisions and procedures in accordance with Appendix 1 of the
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). In
particular: (i) each contract estimated to cost US$200,000 or more; (ii) the first
contract under each project component estimated to cost US$100,000 or more;
and (iii) all direct contracts; shall be subject to prior review, in accordance with
paragraph 2 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. Other goods and works contracts
costing US$50,000 or more shall be subject to post review in accordance with
paragraph 4 of the Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. For technical assistance
contracts, the applicable review procedures are discussed in various sections of
the Guidelines Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 16 --           Project Implementation Plan
Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). However, in the case of firms, for
technical assistance contracts, under US$100,000 equivalent, the Bank will
require prior review of only the terms of reference and short-lists of potential
consultants. In the case of individual consultants, the Bank will require prior
review only of TORs and short lists for contracts under US$50,000 equivalent.
More generally, the Bank's Country Procurement Assistance Review (CPAR) will
be completed early next year after the Procurement Law has been passed by
Parliament.
Disbursement and Financing Schedules
28.   Disbursements. The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a
period of three and one half years, which is shorter than the relevant profile in
the Region (about seven years). The shorter implementation period is possible
due to relatively tight focus of the Project, the strong commitment of the MOF
and generally high level of technical and organizational competency in the
relevant agencies. The closing date will be June 30, 1999. A summary of the
disbursement plan is shown in Table 8.

29.   To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government will establish,
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, a
Special Account in Deutsche marks in a commercial bank acceptable to the World
Bank. During the early phases of the project, the initial allocation of the Special
Account will be limited to 300,000 DEM. However, when the aggregate
disbursements under the Loan reach the level of 3.0 million DEM, the initial
allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of 600,000 DEM.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 17 --  Project Implementation Plan
30.   All disbursements against contracts for goods and services exceeding
US$200,000 equivalent will be fully documented. For expenditures below that level,
disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) for goods
and services up to US$200,000 equivalent for which detailed documents evidencing
expenditures will be reviewed and kept by the MOF and made available for the
required audit as well as to Bank supervision missions.
Audit Timetable
31.   Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited
in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects
Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). The Borrower will provide the Bank
(within six months of the end of each fiscal year), an audit report of such scope
and detail as the Bank may reasonably request, including a separate opinion by an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements against certified
statements of expenses (SOEs). The separate opinion should mention whether
the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and
internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the
related withdrawal applications.
32.   Reporting and Annual Reviews. The PIU will prepare semi-annual
descriptive and financial reports on each project component, objective and
activity (beginning from the date of Loan Effectiveness). The reports will
describe: (i) current status; (ii) deviations, if any, from the implementation plan;
and (iii) the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken. Reporting
and Bank supervision will focus on in-depth reviews of: (i) the emerging policy
framework; {ii) the effectiveness of component and sub-component activities and
their consistency with agreements reached at negotiations; (iii) performance of
the implementing groups and institutions; (iv) emerging needs for adjustments to
project parameters; and (v) possible follow-up operations which could be
supported by the Bank. Bank supervision will be based on the semi-annual
progress reports and the annual evaluation of project activities by the MOF. This
will be supplemented by a review of project expenditures and availability of
financial resources, in addition to substantive discussions with technical
assistance groups implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of various
components, and discussions with responsible authorities. A mid-term review of
the project will be carried out in September 1997. This PIP will provide the basis
for supervision and reporting.
IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES AND SCHEDULES
Project Activities
33.   Activities under each component are summarized below.
a.    Policy Support Component. The Policy Support Component entails
activities under three sub-components:



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 18 --   Project Implementation Plan
i.    CROSEC Development. Since CROSEC and securities
regulations do not already exist, activities in this sub-
component include: (i) the hiring of commissioners and
staff; (ii) legal and regulatory development;
(iii) organizational development; (iv) procedural and
administrative development; (v) staff development; and
(vi) facilities. The Government has already begun looking
for a chief commissioner. The project will provide for a
major TA contact to undertake for the development
activities. The project will also fund equipment to establish
CROSEC's facilities. (See Annex A on page 27 for the TOR
describing the development TA.)
ii.    Tradeable Government Securities. USAID is funding a small
quick-response technical assistance effort to help the
Government and its local consultants convert certain illiquid
government debt obligations into tradeable securities
(specifically, convert the so-called "Big Bonds"). USAID's
consultants have already visited Zagreb (in late 1995) and
are continuing their technical assistance. (See Annex B on
page 35 for the TOR describing this TA.)
iii.   Pension Fund Portfolio Management. USAID will also fund a
major TA effort to help the portfolio management arm of the
Pension Fund. This effort will involve assessment and
planning of the most appropriate management strategy and
administrative arrangements. This will be followed by an
implementation phase focussed on organization, staff and
procedural development. (See Annex C on page 39 for the
TOR describing this TA.)
b.    Infrastructure Development Component. Since it establishes the
common "back office" functions of securities depository, registry,
clearing and settlement under the peculiar circumstances of the
overly-corporatized and widely-disbursed Croatian privatization
program, the Infrastructure Development Component is the largest
and most complex component in the project. Activities under this
component include:
i.    A USAID funded strategic analysis TA effort to: (i) define a
basic vision for these functions; (ii) assess the gaps in the
current structures; (iii) provide a set of recommendation;
(iv) outline a business model for the relevant facilities;
(v) specify a detailed action plan; and (vi) specify the
functional requirements of the information systems required
to support the functions. (See Annex D on page 45 for the
TOR describing this TA.)



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 19 --   Project Implementation Plan
ii.    Staffing, both executives and line staff. Beginning with the
chief executive, the management and staff will be hired
based on the approved organizational and functional design
laid out in the strategic analysis.
iii.   Since the depository, registry, clearing and settlement
facilities (VVS) do not already exist on the scale required to
support the privatization program and robust capital
markets, the project provides for a major development TA
effort to undertake: (i) legal and regulatory development;
(ii) organizational development; (iii) procedural and
administrative development; and (iv) staff development.
(The TOR describing the development TA will be prepared
based on the outcome of the strategic analysis.)
iv.    Facilities development. The project provides for the
acquisition of equipment and space for VVS staff and
business management.
v.    Operational Systems. Based on the strategic analysis, the
project will support the acquisition of the necessary
information systems to support the depository, registry,
clearing and settlement functions (e.g., hardware, software,
customization and implementation services). Given the
complexity of the functionality required, these technologies
will be procured using a two-stage ICB method. In addition
to funding the equipment, the project will provide for a
small amount of TA resources to help with the preparation
of the bidding documents and the evaluation processes.
(The TOR for this TA will be prepared based on the strategic
analysis.)
vi.   Securities Immobilization Program. Since the preliminary
system design entails the immobilization of existing physical
securities and the centralization of the firm-maintained share
registries, gathering and auditing these documents and
providing investors records of their holding is a major
undertaking (probably the most challenging of the entire
project). The project envisions a major TA effort to plan,
execute and audit this immobilization program. (The TOR
for this work will be prepared based on the strategic
analysis and the development TA.) Given the large number
of shares and shareholders, the project also provides for a
major goods procurement to print and distribute receipts for
the immobilized end centrally registered shares.
vii.   Customer Support. Since the depository, registry, clearing
and settlement facilities will create a new set of technical
and procedural requirements for the various participants in
the Croatian capital markets (e.g., exchanges, broker-



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 20 --  Project Implementation Plan
dealers, issuers, corporations, institutional investors,
regulators, market observers, etc.), the project provides for
a limited number of customer terminals (to simplify
implementation) and for some TA on technical and
procedural matters.
viii.  Privatization Plan. As discussed above, the Government
wants to achieve private sector control over VVS as soon as
practically possible. Accordingly, the project provides for a
limited TA effort to assess the situation and prepare a
privatization plan. This will most probably be undertaken in
the last year of the project, once VVS is operational, has a
business record and the many factors which influence the
most appropriate approach have stabilized.
c.    Public Awareness Component. The Public Awareness Campaign
has three basic activities: (i) strategy and planning; (ii) media
development; and (iii) execution. A single large TA effort will
encompass the strategy and planning and the media development
activities, with a more limited involvement in the execution
activities. Campaign execution will be undertaken by the MOP.
Thus, reproduction and distribution of printed materials and
broadcast of television and radio productions will be procured via
separate goods procurements. Annex / on page 59 describes the
planning and development TA effort. This includes the preparation
of: (i) a strategic plan which will identify the substantive content
of the campaign, priorities, mix of mass media instruments,
integration and timing of dissemination; (ii) a media development
plan, which will specify how the materials will be developed and
the process carefully managed; and (iii) a dissemination plan, which
will specify how the broadcast and print material will be put before
the public and how this process will be managed. The TA will also
cover the preparation of the camera-ready print materials and the
broadcast-quality video and audio productions. In addition, the TA
will include a limited continuing effort to strengthen the MOP's
public relations capacity, including the capacity to conduct and
maintain public surveys.
Implementation Schedule
34.   Figure 2 on page 21 summarizes the project implementation schedule,
including activities to establish the project management structures (i.e., the PIU
and the Project Steering Committee). This summary schedule is based on a
detailed project schedule which is in Annex L on page 75.

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 22 --   Project Implementation Plan
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Project Indicators
35.   Tracking key monitoring indicators is necessary to measure the impact of
the project inputs on the project's major development objectives. Given the
essential role program monitoring and evaluation play in determining the impact
of a specific intervention on development objectives, three sets of indicators will
be used to monitor and evaluate progress during implementation of the Project:
outcome indicators, input indicators, and output indicators.
36.   Outcome Indicators. The project objectives are to facilitate the
transformation of the Croatian economy, primarily by supporting capital markets
institutions which lower the risks associated with securities markets.
Accordingly, direct measures of project effectiveness are impractical. However, a
number of indirect indicators of effectiveness are available, including trends in the
consolidation of enterprise ownership and the emergence of institutional and
strategic investors. In addition, project supervision will track:
a.    The elaboration of key securities regulations and operational
procedures, including:
i.    by-laws of CROSEC;
ii.   implementation regulations following from the Securities
Act;
iii.   guidelines for CROSEC staff conducting inspection of
investment firms, stock exchanges, brokers, dealers,
depositories, etc.; and
iv.   regulations and guidelines for confidentiality by CROSEC
staff.
b.    The impact of depository on securities activities, including the:
i.    number of enterprise share registries secured in the
depository;
ii.    number of physical certificates immobilized;
iii.   number of securities trades reflected in changed ownership
records in the depository;
iv.    number of tradeable instruments.
c.    The impact of the public awareness campaign, including:
i.    hours of electronic media air time;



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   -_ 23 --     Project Implementation Plan
ii.    number of items of printed materials distributed to the
public.
37.   Input - Output Indicators will track: (i) planned investments in terms of
contracted technical assistance (staff-months), enrollment and time (staff-
months) in training programs, and procurement of goods; and (ii) items, such as
the number of studies or reports, that have been completed by a given date
during the project cycle. These indicators are shown on the next page in Table 9.

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Capital Markets Development Project
Terms of Reference #1
Technical Assistance
for the
Establishment and Development of the Croatian
Securities and Exchange Commission (CROSEC)
DRAFT: February 15, 1996
Background
1.    During 1993-4 Croatia accomplished one of the most successful
macroeconomic stabilizations on record. Strict fiscal and monetary policies brought
inflation down from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1993 to low single digit annual
rates through 1994 where it has remained. To solidify these gains, to address public
sector financial imbalances and to set the stage for long term, private sector led
growth, the govemment has been shifting socially operated enterprises into private
hands, through buyouts, auctions, vouchers and other methods. Currently, most of
the roughly three thousand enterprises have been corporatized and a large fraction of
the equity is held directly by about three quarters of a million citizens (out of a
population of four and a half million). Liberalization and stabilization have also
prompted an inflow of funds from the roughly two million diaspora Croats as well as
from the off-shore savings of residents.
2.    Continued privatization is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal balance and
economic growth. However, like all transforming formerly socialist economies,
Croatia is struggling to devise a privatization strategy that balances equity, economic
efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete and illiquid capital
markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the authorities' options.
The absence of appropriate regulation and supervision in the securities markets are
particular concerns, as are the inadequate common "back office" facilities to support
debt and equities trading. Together with the public's poor understanding of capital
markets, these weakness present serious risks to the ongoing economic
transformation program.
3.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested and received a loan of
approximately US$9.5 million equivalent from the World Bank (IBRD) to help finance
the costs of the Capital Markets Development Project. The project will:
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and Exchange
Commission (CROSEC).



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 28 --     PIP Annex A: TOR #1
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement
facilities.
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.
Objective of the Work
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the technical assistance (TA)
required to achieve objective "a" above. Specifically these TOR cover the TA to
establish and develop the Croatian Securities and Exchange Commission
(CROSEC), in pursuant to the new Securities Act (December 14,1995).
General Responsibilities
5.    Whereas the covering Letter of Invitation specifies, among other things, the
budget for the work as well as the methods and procedures for evaluating proposal, it
is important to emphasize that: (i) the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the
"consultant") is encouraged to propose extensions, elaborations and refinements to
the work described below; and (ii) with in the allotted budget, the quality of the
consultant's proposed work program will be a central factor in the evaluation.
6.    Reporting and Communications. By the beginning of TA, the first
commissioner of CROSEC will be appointed and on site. Thus, this commissioner,
with the support of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), will be the consultant's primary
counterpart in Croatia. The commissioner and the MOF will provide the consultant
with guidance and facilitate their interactions with the various parties relevant to the
Croatian capital markets, such as the Zagreb Stock Exchange, banks, brokers and
associations. The commissioner and the MOF will also ensure the appropriate level of
coordination of the TA with the other initiatives under the project. The consultant will
present their work to CROSEC, the MOF and the Project Steering Committee, which
has been established to oversee the project. In addition to the deliverables described
in the last section of these TOR, the consultant will present to CROSEC and the MOF
concise monthly progress reports which summarize findings, actions, open questions
and next steps. The last report will be a contract completion report, with
recommendations, if any, for a follow-up actions. The consultant will present this last
report to CROSEC, the MOF and Project Steering Committee no later than two
months after the end of the contract period.
7.    Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following minimum
qualifications:
a.    Extensive hands-on experience in OECD securities markets regulatory
bodies, including the legal, administrative and operational aspects.
Knowledge of comparative regulatory systems, emerging markets and
OECD systems, European Union standards and conventions, in
particular.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 29 --     PIP Annex A: TOR #1
b.    Experience drafting and analyzing securities related legislation and
regulations. Experience in legal matters pertaining to compliance and
enforcement of financial regulations.
c.    Experience in the organization and management of securities markets
regulatory agencies.
d.    Experience organizing, running and developing private sector
enterprises and financial organizations.
e.    Experience designing, coordinating and conducting executive and staff
development programs for financial sector organizations.
f.    Knowledge of the peculiar circumstances of the transitional formerly
socialist economies, including the challenges of the political economy
and the financial systems in particular.
9.    Experience in leading and managing similar technical assistance
programs.
h.    Fluency in the Croatian Language (by, at minimum, one professional
team member).
Scope of Work
8.    Timing. The TA should begin in December 1996 and continue until December
1998.
9.    Description of Work. The TA involves four major development thrusts:
(i) legal and regulatory; (ii) organizational; (iii) procedural and administrative; and
(iv) executive and staff skills. Broadly speaking, the legal, regulatory and
organizational work will be the focus of the first few months of the TA. This work will
guide the subsequent TA in the procedural, administrative and skills development
areas.
10.   The consultant will first survey the Croatian capital markets to: (i) identify the
types of financial instruments currently or potentially in use in the Croatian capital
markets; (ii) identify all the major participants in the market; (iii) identify individuals
within the participating firms and institutions with whom a working relationship can be
established; and (iv) canvas the participant's views of CROSEC's appropriate role in
developing and regulating Croatia's capital markets. These working relationships will
be critical to the success of the TA and the development of the Croatian capital
markets in general. The consultant will present the survey findings to the
commissioner, the MOF and the Project Steering Committee.
11.   The consultant will also immediately embark on a review of existing and
proposed legislation (including, but not limited to, the Securities Act, Investment Fund
Law, Company Act and legislation pertaining to the payments system). Based on this
review the consultant will prepare a number of written assessments,
recommendations and plans.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 30 --     PIP Annex A: TOR #1
a.    Legal functions and powers. The consultant will determine the
functions which CROSEC will carry out by law and its legal powers. In
tum, the consultant will identify, discuss and recommend areas of
responsibilities and powers which similar regulatory bodies possess in
OECD economies and, as appropriate, emerging markets.
b.    Legislative consistency. The consultant will identify areas of
inconsistency, ambiguity or other potential difficulties within the set of
relevant legislation. The consultant will also identify areas which may
conflict with intemational standards and best practices. The
consultant will identify specific options, discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of each option, and recommended actions to resolve
these legal difficulties.
c.    Initial organization and staffing plan. The consultants will draft an
initial organization and staffing plan to match CROSEC's
responsibilities and the Croatian context. Organizational design must
address, but not be limited to: regulatory review, drafting and
research, regulatory enforcement, intemal and external review,
appeals, public and international relations.
d.    Basic action plan. The organizational and staffing plans will provide
the basis for a basic action plan to achieve the proposed
organizational design. The action plan will also include first estimates
of projected budgets for the next three years. In the context of the
budget projections, the consultant will also identify common and
appropriate revenue areas, including typical charges used in OECD
markets.
12.   Once the legislative survey and the above assessments and plans have been
approved by the commissioner, the MOF and the Project Steering Committee, the
consultant will assist CROSEC prepare a public statement regarding its policy and
approach to regulating the securities markets. This will be a clear statement of the
principles behind CROSEC's regulatory responsibilities and powers, market self-
regulation, disclosure requirements and enforcement mechanisms.
13.   Also, once the basic action plan has been approved, the consultant will start
drafting more detailed plans for institutional development work. This plan will include,
but not be limited to: (i) regulatory development, (ii) procedural development,
(iii) administrative development, (iv) executive and staff skills development.
14.    Pursuant to the new Securities Act, CROSEC has been charged with drafting
the secondary, implementing regulations for Croatian capital markets legislation.
These run the full spectrum of capital markets issues, from regulating (or permitting
self-regulation) of broker/dealers, to establishing listing requirements for publicly
traded companies. Thus, the regulatory development plan will need to address at a
minimum and without limitation:
a.    Conditions for admission of securities to stock exchange listings.
b.    Requirements for establishing stock exchanges.
c.    Disclosure requirements at the time of offering.
d.    Financial, auditing and other reporting requirements for listed and other
widely held companies. (The consultants should also assess reporting



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 31 --      PIP Annex A: TOR #1
arrangements for closely held companies and, if necessary,
recommend how they should be strengthened or changed.)
e.    Disclosure and acquisition or disposal of major holdings.
f.    Insider trading.
9.    Regulation of investment funds.
h.    Rights of minority shareholders.
i.    Enforcement mechanisms (fees, penalties etc.).
j.    Enforcement capacity (rights of seizure, etc.).
The consultant will also assist in the preparation of other capital market legislation
and regulations, including legislation relating to the clearing, payment and settlement
of securities, such as liability for wrongful or negligent actions taken in clearing,
paying and settling securities transactions.
15.   Each regulation creates a set of procedural requirements for CROSEC and
market participants. The consultant must, therefore, prepare plans to develop these
procedures, CROSEC's capacity to carry them out and the market participants'
understanding of their rights and responsibilities. If appropriate, the procedures
should be codified in an operations manual and promulgated through informational
pamphlets, bulletins or other such outreach mechanisms. The plan must cover the
development of professional codes of ethics, based on international best practices
and the particulars of the Croatian context. It must also cover the identification and
development of the necessary information systems tools to carry out CROSEC
supervisory and regulatory operations. These will need to be complemented with
methods to ensure effective working relations between CROSEC and other important
capital markets entities, such as the securities depository, registry, clearing and
settlement facilities, which is also being established through separate TA activities
under the project. The consultant will have to work closely with counterparts from the
various market participants, agencies and consultancies to ensure these methods are
acceptable and, thus, effective.
16.   CROSEC's organizational structure and its functional-procedural
responsibilities create a set of administrative requirements to manage and monitor
CROSEC operations. Thus, the consultant must also identify these requirements and
prepare a plan to develop CROSEC's administrative capacity. Among other things,
the plan must address reporting relationships and management functions. Detailed
staffing plans with job descriptions and qualifications must be specified. The plan
must also address the development of information systems to support management
functions (e.g., programs and budgeting, personnel, material management, etc.).
17.   As regulatory, procedural and administrative requirements emerge, these will
determine the requirements for executive and staff skills development. Accordingly,
the consultant will prepare a plan to conduct skills development programs as
CROSEC gains executives and staff over the duration of the TA.
18.   The executive development plan must address, but not be limited to:
(i) management practices; (ii) internationally accepted accounting principles;
(iii) company finances and record keeping; (iv) debt, equity, quasi-equity and off-
balance sheet instruments; (v) domestic and international capital markets;
(vi) regulation and enforcement techniques; (vii) financial sector institutions and
principles; (viii) employee-employer relations; and (ix) consensus building techniques
and communication skills. The consultant will also arrange study tours to European,
American and, as appropriate, emerging market securities regulators to see, on a



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 32 --      PIP Annex A: TOR #1
first-hand basis, regulation in action. To the extent possible, the consultant shall make
use of free training provided by some national securities regulators (such as the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission's Emerging Markets Course). The separate
travel and subsistence budget for executive skill development during the TA period is
about US$75,000. This will be administered by the overall Project Implementation
Unit. However, the consultant is responsible for all other skills development expenses
out of the budget for this TA.
19.   Similarly, the staff skills development plan must address, but not be limited to:
(i) company structure and finances; (ii) internationally accepted accounting principles;
(iii) regulatory methods; (iv) debt, equity and quasi-equity instruments; (v) customer
relations and communications; and (vi) business and operational information systems.
During the implementation phase of the TA, the consultant will undertake the various
development plans, including skills development. However, a separate budget of
about US$150,000 will cover travel and subsistence costs for staff skills development.
This should support in-country training and study tours to selected regulatory
agencies in the region. As with the executive training, all other training expenses will
be covered by the budget for the TA.
20.   Following the action plan and based on the approved regulatory, procedural,
administrative and staff development plans, the consultant will implement the
regulatory, procedural, administrative and skills development plans during the period
of the TA. Although the regulatory development work will be ongoing, the core of the
work should be completed within the first three or four months of the assignment.
The bulk of the procedural development will follow closely the development of the
core regulations. However, of necessity, substantial procedural development will
extend over the TA period, as CROSEC develops its operational capacities and as
the capital markets develop from their relatively nascent states. Similarly, the
administrative and staff development work entail significant initial efforts to get
CROSEC started as an institution. However the bulk of the effort will stretch out over
the TA period, as CROSEC is staffed and its operational activities expand.
Deliverables
21.   Deliverables under this TA contract are reports and presentations to the
relevant counterpart agencies. These reports will also be conveyed to the World
Bank by the project administration for the Bank's review. Thus, in addition to the
progress reports described in the paragraph on reporting and communications, the
deliverables for this TA (with approximate timings) are:
a.    Phase 1: Review and Planning.
i.    Initial survey of capital markets conditions and participants
(week 4).
ii.    Statement of CROSEC's legal functions and powers (week 6).
iii.    Review of legislative consistency (week 6).
iv.   Initial organization and staffing plans (week 6).
v.    Basic action plan (week 8).

Terms of Reference #2
Technical Assistance for the Conversion of Govemment Debt
DRAFT: February 15, 1996
Background
1.   In 1992, the Croatian banks received about US$1.1 billion worth of
govemment obligations -- the so-called "Big Bonds". These obligations are payable,
in Kuna, in forty semi-annual installments during 1992-2012. Interest is equal to the
rate of producer price inflation. Thirty-three installment payments are still due. Their
terms, however, make these obligations virtually non-tradable. The Govemment has
recently agreed with the banks on the need to convert them into tradeable securities.
This would permit the banks to sell them to other investors, including long-term
institutional investors (domestic and foreign), such as insurance companies, mutual
funds and pension funds. In addition to expanding the banks' portfolio management
options, this would also enhance the liquidity of the debt markets and, thus, help
clarify the structure of interest rates in Croatia.
2.   In the wake of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, commercial banks
also received government obligations of about US$2.2 billion to offset foreign
currency assets lost by the banks during the break up -- the so-called "Frozen
Deposits". These obligations are denominated in Deutsche Mark (or Kuna equivalent)
and are payable in twenty semi-annual installments, the first dated June 30, 1995,
with interest at five percent per annum. They are essentially illiquid, with a very small
secondary market. The Government has also expressed an interest in securitizing
these obligations.
3.   In early July 1995, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) contracted the services of a
local broker, INVESTCO, to prepare the design of new securities to replace the Big
Bonds. The proposal should be finalized by end-August 1995. The MOF and
INVESTCO felt the need for the services of an international debt securities expert (or
experts) to advise them on specific technical details concerning the design of these
securities and to help them in actual issuing of the bonds.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 36 --   PIP Annex B: TOR #2
Objective of Work
4.    The United States Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) has made
funds available for the technical assistance (TA) described in these terms of
reference (TOR). Specifically, the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the
Mconsultant") would assist with the conversion of the Big Bonds. Once this effort is
underway, the Govemment may wish to address the problem of the Frozen Deposits.
Thus, the authorities may ask the selected consultant to prepare a proposal to extend
this assistance to cover the Frozen Deposits. However, the current assignment
applies only to the conversion of the Big Bonds.
General Responsibilities
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Finance will be the
consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The MOF will provide the consultant with
guidance and facilitate their interactions with INVESTCO, the banks and other parties
relevant to the Croatian capital markets. The consultant(s) will present their work to
the MOF.
6.    Qualifications. The consultant will have the following qualifications:
a.    A demonstrated knowledge of the theory of modern public finance,
capital markets and commercial bank portfolio management.
b.    Extensive experience in structuring primary bond issues in OECD
countries.
C.    Experience in commercial bank portfolio management.
d.    Experience in public debt management.
Also, desirable qualifications include:
e.    Experience in structuring primary bond issues in transforming formerly
socialist economies.
f.    Experience issuing and trading Deutsche mark denominated
Eurobonds.
Scope of Work
7.    Timing. The assistance should commence as soon as possible and
conclude by end of June 1996.
8.    Description of Work. Certain features of the new securities, including the
maturity and interest rate, have been determined. Thus, the consultant(s) will
work with the MOF, INVESTCO and key representatives of the banking
community to define the features of the new securities, including, but not limited
to: fli type of bond, (e.g., zero coupon, annual, semi-annual, convertible, etc.);
(ii) currency of denomination; (iii) initial discount; (iv) amount of principal;



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 37 --      PIP Annex B: TOR #2
(v) holder identification method (e.g., registered versus bearer form) and holder
restrictions; and (vi) supporting mechanisms, such as depository, registry,
clearing and settlement arrangements.
9.    In determining these features, the consultant will assess the impact of the
proposed conversion options on: (i) the state budget and (ii) the various banks'
incomes and balance sheets. The consultant will assess which conversion features
are the most interesting for domestic and international institutional investors. The
consultant(s) will also advise on technical details related to actual issuing of the
new securities and will provide assistance identifying potential international
institutional investors that may be interested in the new securities.
Deliverables
10.   In the course of the assistance, the consultant will prepare the following
documents and present them to the MOF.
a.    An assessment of INVESTCO's proposal.
b.    A set of recommendations for the key features of the new
securities and the procedures required to support their issue and
trading.
c.    Projections of the impact on public debt and cash flow
management.
d.    Projections of the impact of the new securities on commercial bank
financial management, including, if necessary an assessment of the
impact on individual or groups of banks.

Technical Assistance
to the
Pension Fund in Managing Its Portfolio of Assets
DRAFT: February 15, 1996
Background
1.    During 1993-4 Croatia accomplished one of the most successful
macroeconomic stabilizations on record. Strict fiscal and monetary policies
brought inflation down from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1993 to low single
digit annual rates through 1994 where it has remained. To solidify these gains,
to address public sector financial imbalances and to set the stage for long term,
private sector led growth, the government has been shifting socially operated
enterprises into private hands, through buyouts, auctions, vouchers and other
methods. Currently, most of the roughly three thousand enterprises have been
corporatized and a large fraction of the equity is held directly by about three
quarters of a million citizens (out of a population of four and a half million).
Liberalization and stabilization have also prompted an inflow of funds from the
roughly two million diaspora Croats as well as from the off-shore savings of
residents.
2.    Continued privatization is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal balance
and economic growth. However, like all transforming formerly socialist
economies, Croatia is struggling to devise a privatization strategy that balances
equity, economic efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete
and illiquid capital markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the
authorities' options.
3.    Institutionally, the Croatian Privatization Fund (CPF) and the Republic Fund
for Pension and Disability Insurance of Workers in Croatia ("The Pension Fund")
are important agents in the privatization program. Specifically, in the process of
privatizing enterprises, initially unsold shares are allocated to the CPF (two thirds)
and to the Pension Fund (one third). The CPF subsequently undertakes to place
these unsold shares through various methods. The share allocation for the



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 40 --     PIP Annex C: TOR #3
Pension Fund goes to capitalizing the Fund, so that benefits are not exclusively
dependent on worker contributions and general budgetary resources.
4.    As of March 1995, the Pension Fund has received shares in over 1200
joint-stock companies, with a total nominal value of DM 3.5 billion. The
Pension Fund's equity stakes vary from negligible (0.06%) to up to a third.
However, most range between ten and twenty percent. The most significant
holdings include: one third of the oil company, JANAF, (nominal value
DM 247 million); one third of the pharmaceutical company, PLIVA, (nominal value
DM 233 million); and one quarter of the steel works, ZELJEZARA SISAK,
(nominal value DM 11 7 million). The draft of the new privatization law under
discussion in Parliament, envisages the Pension Fund also receiving a quarter of
the shares in the public utilities (nominal value about DM 12.5 billion). In
addition, the Pension Fund may be asked to manage shares that will be allocated
to current pensioners (several thousand DM worth per pensioner).
5.    Accordingly, the Pension Fund has and will receive a large and diverse
portfolio of shares to manage. Currently, the Pension Fund is trying to
"rationalize" its portfolio by selling shares in the companies that it does not want
to hold "permanently", via monthly public tenders (in which about 140 blocks of
shares have been sold to date). The Pension Fund's intention is to narrow its
portfolio to about 200 companies (in preferred sectors, such as tourism, catering
industry, food production, wood and timber processing ). This concentration, the
Pension Fund believes, will enable it to hold a significant proportion of a firm's
capital and, thus, exercise effective shareholder control. The Pension Fund also
envisages creating three separate sub-funds, organized either by beneficiary (fund
for workers, farmers and self-employed) or by sector (tourism, service companies,
industry, etc.).
6.    Notwithstanding these plans, the Pension Fund has relatively few skills
and limited experience in portfolio management. Accordingly, the Pension Fund
needs a substantial amount of external technical assistance to, among other
things: (i) improve its financial management; (ii) define the guidelines for future
operations of the proposed holding company and investment fund; and (iii) set up
and manage the holding company and the investment fund. This will require legal
and managerial advice, as well as long-term portfolio management assistance.
Objective of Work
7.   In support of these activities, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) has made funds available for the technical assistance (TA)
described in these terms of reference (TOR). Specifically, the consultant or
consulting firm (hereafter the "consultant") would assist the Pension Fund clarify
its portfolio management strategy and strengthen its portfolio management
operations.
8.    Note: this technical assistance does not cover the operational or strategic
aspects of the Pension Fund's benefits or contributions activities. These issues
are expected to be the subject of comprehensive review and reform, under the



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 41 --     PIP Annex C: TOR #3
proposed World Bank Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PSAL). These reforms
focus on introducing a multi-pillar arrangement for pensions: a pay-as-you-go,
minimum benefits First Pillar; a mandatory, funded Second Pillar of individual
retirement accounts; and a voluntary, privately funded Third Pillar. The
objectives are to: (i) create a fiscally sound pension system; (ii) diversify sources
of retirement income; (iii) link benefits and contributions more tightly; (iv) create
markets for long-term financial instruments; and (v) reduce reliance on external
funds. The contracted consultant must take these reforms into consideration in
the conduct of their portfolio management assistance.
General Responsibilities
9.    Reporting and Communications.  The Pension Fund will be the
consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The Pension Fund will provide the
consultant with guidance and facilitate their interactions with the relevant parties
in the Croatian capital markets. The consultant will present their work to the
Pension Fund and the MOF, which is the prime counterpart for the proposed,
World Bank financed Capital Markets Developrnent Project, of which this USAID
financed assistance is an integral part.
10.   The MOF and the Project Steering Cormmittee, which will be established
under the Capital Markets Development Project, will also help the consultant liaise
with other consultancies working under this project on such initiatives as: (i) the
establishment of the Croatian Securities and Exchange Commission (CROSEC);
(ii) the establishment of securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement
facilities; and (iii) the design and conduct of a public awareness campaign relating
to privatization and the capital markets in general. Close interactions with these
initiatives will be critical for the success of the selected consultants' work, since
the Pension Fund's portfolio management strategy and operations will face
constraints such as: (i) few shares are currently quoted; (ii) the capital markets
are generally illiquid; (iii) corporate governance is underdeveloped; and (iv) the
financial situation of companies are typically weak and, therefore, the value of
underlying shares is highly uncertain as is their capacity to generate dividends.
11.    In addition to the deliverables described in the last section of these TOR,
the consultant will present to the Pension Fund, the MOF and the Project Steering
Committee concise monthly progress reports which summarize findings, actions,
open questions and next steps. The last report will be a contract completion
report, with recommendations, if any, for a follow-up actions. The consultant
will present this last report to the Pension Fund, the MOF and the Project
Steering Committee no later than two months after the end of the contract
period.
12.   Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following
minimum qualifications:
a.    Demonstrated knowledge of modern theory of portfolio
management.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 42 --    PIP Annex C: TOR #3
b.    Extensive experience the in design, management and operations of
large portfolios for institutional investors, such as pension funds
and life insurance companies, in OECD countries. Experience in
both Continental European and Anglo-American contexts.
c.    Extensive experience in emerging markets.
d.    Experience in investing in capital markets of transforming formerly
socialist economies.
e.    Demonstrated legal expertise and experience in establishing public
agencies and financial entities.
f.    Demonstrated expertise in organizing and managing similar
technical assistance in transitional or newly industrializing
environments.
Scope of Work
13.   Timing. Proposed duration of the assistance is one year, from August
1996 to August 1997. During this period, it is anticipated that a full time senior
advisor would remain on site and other specialist team members would visit as
interventions are required.
14.   Description of Work. The work has two basic phases: an assessment and
planning phase, lasting roughly two to three months; followed by an
implementation phase, involving the establishment of the proposed asset
management entity and the building of its asset management capacity.
15.   The consultant will begin by taking stock of the current and anticipated
circumstances of the Pension Fund's portfolio, the capital markets, the enterprise
sector and the proposed pension reforms. This will guide the formulation of a
basic vision statement for the Pension Fund's asset management capability,
objectives and strategy. This vision will recommend, among other things, the:
(i) Pension Fund's stance as an active versus passive investor, active versus
passive shareholder, a concentrated versus diverse investor, etc.; (ii) portfolio
objectives for asset management, such as income versus asset value growth,
balance of asset types, etc.; (iii) relationship between the Pension Fund and the
asset management entity; (iv) the scope for the asset management entity to
contract asset management services; and (v) evolution of these features, as
pension reform unfolds.
16.   Based on a government approved vision, with appropriate revisions as
necessary, the consultants will then devise an implementation plan, including, but
not limited to, a portfolio management plan, an organizational plan and a skills
development plan.
17.   Among other things, the portfolio management plan must address, among
other things: (i) re-balancing the composition of the portfolio from 100% equity



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 43 --     PIP Annex C: TOR #3
to a mix of equity, debt, property and money market investments; (ii) acquisition
and sales of equity in the imperfect market environment; (iii) ensuring flow of
dividends in imperfect accounting and legal environments; and (iv) assistance to
companies in further privatization and restructuring.
18.   The authorities envision the Pension Fund's portfolio management arm as
a wholly owned independent legal entity, with a separate management. Thus,
the consultants must analyze and recommend the most appropriate: (i) legal
structure of the entity; (ii) fiscal and legal basis of its operations; and
(iii) organizational structure, including overall management, internal and external
controls, external relations, etc. In addition, the consultant must prepare a
staffing plan, with management and staffing levels, plus job descriptions and
qualifications. Accordingly, the consultant may be called upon to help evaluate
and hire staff.
19.   The main difficulty will lay in building adequate executive and staff
capacities to manage this asset management entity and carry out its operations.
Thus, a critical part of the TA will be to devise and execute a skills development
plan covering, but not limited to: (i) asset management principles and techniques
prevailing both in Continental Europe and in Anglo-Saxon countries; (ii) corporate
finance and restructuring; (iii) other capital and property market investment
instruments and strategies; and (iv) investor relations.
20.   Since the Pension Fund's portfolio management entity may contract for
external fund managers, as assessed and decided upon through the basic vision
statement, the consultant must be prepared to, if appropriate, draft terms of
reference and assist the Pension Fund in contracting for such services.
Deliverables.
21.   In addition to direct assistance to the Pension Fund, the consultant will
prepare a set of documents for the Pension Fund and the Government for their
review, approval and revision. These include (with approximate timings):
a.    Phase 1: Assessment and Planning.
i.    Initial assessment (week 3).
ii.    Basic vision statement (week 5).
iii.   Portfolio management action plan (week 8).
iv.    Organizational action plan (week 10).
v.    Skills development action plan (week 12).

DRAFT: February 15, 1996
Background
1.    During 1993-4 Croatia accomplished one of the most successful
macroeconomic stabilizations on record. Strict fiscal and monetary policies
brought inflation down from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1993 to low single
digit annual rates through 1994 where it has remained. To solidify these gains,
to address public sector financial imbalances and to set the stage for long term,
private sector led growth, the government has been shifting socially operated
enterprises into private hands, through buyouts, auctions, vouchers and other
methods. Currently, most of the roughly three thousand enterprises have been
corporatized and a large fraction of the equity is held directly by about three
quarters of a million citizens (out of a population of four and a half million).
Liberalization and stabilization have also prompted an inflow of funds from the
roughly 2 million diaspora Croats as well as from the off-shore savings of
residents.
2.    Continued privatization is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal balance
and economic growth. However, like all transforming formerly socialist
economies, Croatia is struggling to devise a privatization strategy that balances
equity, economic efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete
and illiquid capital markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the
authorities' options. The absence of appropriate regulation and supervision in the
securities markets are particular concerns, as are the inadequate common 'back
office" facilities to support debt and equities trading. Together with the public's
poor understanding of capital markets, these weakness present serious risks to
the ongoing economic transformation program.
3.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested a loan, currently
estimated at approximately US$9.5 million equivalent, from the World Bank
(IBRD) to help finance the costs of the Capital Markets Development Project. The
project will:



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 46         PIP Annex D: TOR #4
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and
Exchange Commission (CROSEC).
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement
facilities.
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.
Objective of Work
4.    In support of these activities and objective "b" in particular, the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) has made funds available
for the technical assistance (TA) described in these terms of reference (TOR).
Specifically, the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the "consultant")
will formulate an actionable strategy to realize modern securities depository,
registry, clearing and settlement facilities. These will be realized under the
project with World Bank support.
General Responsibilities
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the
consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The Ministry will provide the
consultant with guidance and facilitate its interactions with the various parties
relevant to the Croatian capital markets. The consultant will present its work to
the Ministry and the Project Steering Committee that will be established to
oversee the work.
6.    Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following
minimum qualifications:
a.    Comprehensive legal, regulatory, managerial and technical
experience in key capital market entities in OECD economies.
b.    Significant experience in institutional development in depository,
registry, clearing and settlements facilities, including organizational,
procedural and staff development.
c.    Knowledge of national capital markets strategies for transforming
formerly socialist economies.
d.    Extensive experience in the analysis of information systems in
capital markets institutions, including, but not restricted to,
securities registries and depositories, clearing, settlement and
supervisory agencies, as well as trading and corporate finance
institutions.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 47 --     PIP Annex D: TOR #4
e.    Knowledge of worldwide market for information technologies
relevant to the capital markets, particularly clearing, settlement,
book-entry, central securities depository and registration systems.
f.    Knowledge of public sector international competitive procurement
procedures.
Scope of Work
7.    Timing. The TA should begin in March 1 996 and continue for about six
months.
8.    Description of Work. The consultant would start by preparing a review of
the current and anticipated structure of the Croatian capital markets (including
the new securities, company and investment fund laws). Among other things,
the consultant must take due note of the unusually large number of shareholders
and corporations, relative to the size of the population and the economy, as well
as the inexperience of capital market participants, shareholders, corporations,
brokers, banks, etc. This will have a major influence on the most appropriate
structures, procedures and timing of developments for the securities depository,
registry, clearing and settlement functions.
9.    Based on this review, the consultants will prepare:
a.    A basic vision for the securities depository, registry, clearing and
settlement functions. This would address fundamental issues,
such as centralization versus decentralization of these functions
(i.e., single versus multi-vault registries, final customer versus
custodial accounts) comprehensive versus selected coverage of
securities, gross versus net settlement, linkages to international
capital markets and the most appropriate arrangements for
guarantee schemes, among other issues. Where necessary, the
consultants will prepare a clear statement of the key open
questions that shape the basic architecture of the institutions and
relations for these functions. These may include access to the
depository/registry, handling of preemptive rights and other
regulatory restrictions on securities holdings, the synchronization of
trading among exchanges, among others questions. The basic
vision should also outline any necessary regulatory structures to
protect the public interest in the face of any potential monopolies
arising within the basic architecture.
b.    An analysis of the gaps in legal, regulatory, institutional, procedural
and human capital. In this regard, the consultants should take due
note of and work closely with the consulting team that will be
beginning regulatory and institutional development work for the
securities and exchange commission. Also, the consultant should
review and assess the current legislation regarding the
dematerialization of new securities issues and the immobilization



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 48 --      PIP Annex D: TOR #4
and dematerialization of the existing physical securities. As
appropriate, the consultants should suggest elaborations or
adjustments to the codes.
c.    A set of recommendations regarding the remaining open questions
and approaches to close the identified gaps. These
recommendations must accord with international standards and
recommendations from the International Organization of Securities
Commission's Group of 30 and take into account the work of other
international professional organizations. They must also reflect the
relevant experiences of other countries in the region and recognize
Croatia's position as a small, open economy abutting the European
Union. The recommendations, for example, should address how
legal responsibilities should progress through the various stages of
the clearing and settlement processes. They should address
security, business continuity, auditing and confidentiality issues, as
well as public disclosure and supervisory linkages. The
recommendations should propose organizational plans, with
appropriate staffing levels and facilities requirement, and should
propose by-laws, codes of professional behavior and suggest key
procedures.
d.    A business model for the recommended facilities. This model
should provide implementation and operating costs projections,
suggested fee structures, five-year high-medium-low revenue
projections and approaches to gap financing. The plan must
address how the contributions of various agencies, such as the
Ministry of Finance, the Institute for Payment Transactions (ZZPP),
and the Croatian Privatization Fund, to the facilities implementation
and operation should be reflected in their capital and governance
structures and how such facilities can be privatized once
established and operational. The consultants should prepare a
draft charter for the facilities. However, if the time profile of
anticipated securities trading suggests that the optimal
arrangements will have to change over, say, five years (e.g., shifts
from centralized to distributed registries), this should be reflected in
the plans.
e.    A detailed action plan to achieve operational securities depository,
registry, clearing and settlement facilities, including a phased
transitional plan, time table and assessable milestones to move to
the recommended configuration from the current situation. This
should address all the relevant aspects of organizational
development, staffing, procedural, and facilities development.
Among other things, the consultants should identify opportunities
for "twinning" the Croatian facilities with comparable facilities in
other countries. Also, securities immobilization and data
acquisition (from ZZPP, Croatian Privatization Fund, corporations,
public issues, etc.) programs also must be specified in detail. This
includes auditing procures and responsibilities as well as cost



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project   - 49 --    PIP Annex D: TOR #4
effective methods to provide investors with documentation of their
immobilized/dematerialized holdings.
f.    A detailed statement of functional requirement for information
systems to support the depository, registry, clearing and settlement
functions. This should be based on a catalog of information and
flows for all capital market transactions which result in depository,
registry, clearing or settlement actions. These functional
requirements will be used to prepare international competitive
bidding documents to procure the necessary technologies and
services to implement these facilities. The consultants will also
provide a review of the market for relevant information systems
products and services, including estimated costs for the required
systems. Note: Pending the outcome of the work and the
availability of Republic of Croatia or World Bank resources, the
assignment may be extended to prepare procurement documents
and advise a project implementation unit on the evaluation of bids.
Deliverables
10.   Deliverables (with approximate timing) under this TA contract are reports
and presentations to inter-agency steering committees and key capital market
participants:
a.    Initial Review and Basic Vision (month 1)
b.    Gap Analysis (month 2)
c.    Recommendations (month 3)
d.    Business Model (month 4)
e.    Action Plan (month 5)
f.    Functional Requirements for informatics procurement (month 6)

Background
1.    During 1 993-4 Croatia accomplished one of the most successful
macroeconomic stabilizations on record. Strict fiscal and monetary policies
brought inflation down from near hyper-inflationary levels in 1993 to low single
digit annual rates through 1994 where it has remained. To solidify these gains,

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 60 --     PIP Annex 1: TOR #9
3.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested and received a loan of
approximately US$9.5 million equivalent from the World Bank (IBRD) to help
finance the costs of the Capital Markets Development Project. The project will:
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and
Exchange Commission (CROSEC).
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement
facilities.
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.
Objective of the Work
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the technical assistance (TA)
required to achieve objective "c" above. Specifically, these TOR cover TA to devise
a public awareness campaign and develop the supporting print and electronic
materials. Reproduction and distribution of printed materials and the broadcast of
radio and television programs are not part of the TA and, thus, are not to be covered
by the budget for this assistance, which is approximately US$0.7 million.
General Responsibilities
5.    Whereas the covering Letter of Invitation specifies, among other things, the
budget for the work as well as the methods and procedures for evaluating proposal, it
is important to emphasize that: (i) the consultant or consulting firm (hereafter the
"consultant") is encouraged to propose extensions, elaborations and refinements to
the work described below; and (ii) with in the allotted budget, the quality of the
consultant's proposed work program will be a central factor in the evaluation.
6.    Restrictions. As detailed in the consulting contract, all materials created
under this TA contract will remain the sole property of the Republic of Croatia.
Re-use of the materials will require the formal, written approval of the
Government.
7.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Privatization (MOP) will
be the consultant's primary counterpart in Croatia. The MOP will provide the
consultant with guidance and facilitate their interactions with the various parties
relevant to the Croatian capital markets, such as the Zagreb Stock Exchange,
banks, brokers and associations. The MOP will also ensure the appropriate level
of coordination of the TA with the other initiatives under the project. The
consultant will present their work to the MOP, Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the
Project Steering Committee, which has been established to oversee the project.
In addition to the deliverables described in the last section of these TOR, the
consultant will present to the MOP concise monthly progress reports which
summarize findings, actions, open questions and next steps. The last report will
be a contract completion report, with recommendations, if any, for a follow-up



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 61 --     PIP Annex l: TOR #9
actions. The consultant will present this last report to the MOP and Project
Steering Committee no later than two months after the end of the contract
period.
8.    Qualifications. The consultant will propose a team with the following
minimum qualifications:
a.    International experience in design and implementation of public
education or public awareness campaigns, including the
management of interdisciplinary teams and sub-contractors.
b.    Thorough knowledge of OECD financial systems and capital
markets in particular.
c.    Practical experience with the peculiar circumstances of the
transforming formerly socialist economies.
d.    Thorough knowledge of and extensive experience with the graphic
and video arts as well as the editorial and pedagogical fields.
e.    Thorough understanding of the Croatian society, culture, language,
history, economic and political situation.
f.    Fluency in the Croatian Language (by, at minimum, one
professional team member).
Accordingly, the consultant are encouraged to incorporate Croatian nationals and
firms into the team, including local graphics and video production resources.
Scope of Work
9.    Timing. The TA should begin in September 1996 and continue for about
six months, followed by more limited, period interventions through December
1998.
10.   Description of Work. The work divides into three stages. In the first, the
consultants will prepare a strategic plan, a media development plan and a
dissemination plan. The second stage involves the creation of an integrated set
of printed and electronic educational materials. The third stage entails a more
limited assistance to the MOP to help execute the reproduction and dissemination
activities. As usual, continuation of the TA from one stage to the next will be
contingent on the satisfactory performance of the earlier stage. Also, depending
on the perceived need, the Government may ask the consultant to prepare a
proposal to somewhat expand the third stage assistance. Thus, a consultant's
initial proposal should specify the anticipated effort levels and relevant fees for
the various categories of consultants for each of the three stages.
11.   During the first stage, the consultant will assess the current situation in
Croatia, in terms of the state of the capital markets and the public's



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 62 --     PIP Annex 1: TOR #9
comprehension and attitudes. Based on this assessment, the consultant will
prepare an overall strategic plan for the campaign. This strategic plan will
include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the scope of the substantive
"curriculum", priorities among the substantive topics, the best mix of various
types of printed and electronic media materials, the optimum degree of
integration among the materials, most appropriate timing of dissemination
activities, and mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of the program.
12.   Once approved by the MOP and the Project Advisory Committee, the
strategic plan will guide the preparation of a media development plan. This
would specify in detail, among other things, the array of printed and electronic
materials to be created in the second stage, the substantive content of the
various materials, how these will be created and how the whole process will be
managed and coordinated. This development plan will also require the approval
of the MOP and the Project Advisory Committee, before the consultant turn to
preparing the dissemination plan.
13.   Since the MOP, with the assistance of the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), will separately procure the reproduction, distribution and broadcast
services, the dissemination plan will include, but not be limited to, specifying the
most effective method and timing to disseminate the materials, how to monitor
and coordinate these activities, and what public relations capacities the MOP will
need to complement the PAP materials.
14.   As soon as possible during the first stage, the consultant should undertake
a preliminary benchmark survey to find out the existing public perceptions of and
expectations for the capital markets and privatization. It will also gather
information on the interests of the various groups as they relate to the capital
markets and privatization, such as current voucher holders, enterprise managers,
workers, pensioners, and entrepreneurs. Among other things, the survey should
identify what type of media (television, newspapers, radio) people prefer to
receive information from. In addition, a practical program of periodic, follow-on
surveys should be devised. Bidders should elaborate on the scale, content,
method and frequency of this survey program as part of their proposals, clearly
identifying what the consultants propose to undertake and what would be the
responsibilities of the MOP and others.
1 5.  In devising the substantive content of the campaign, the objective of the
mass education campaign is to familiarize the public with the objectives and
functions of capital markets. This includes its instruments, institutions, practices
and procedures, as well as the rights and responsibilities of share and bond
holders. Thus, the campaign must educate the general public (in contrast to
market professionals) on such topics as:
a.    Basic economic relations in a market economy.
b.    Corporate and other forms of enterprise management and
financing.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 63 --        PIP Annex 1: TOR #9
c.    The roles financial institutions, including banks, stock and bond
markets, supervisory and rating agencies, institutional investors,
etc.
d.    Privatization methods, including mass (voucher) privatization,
auctions, flotation, management buyouts, etc.
e.    Types of securities, e.g., stock, bonds, derivatives, options, etc.
f.    Basic financial terminology: shares, bonds, EPS, PER, market
versus book value, etc.
9.    Legal rights of share and bond holders.
h.    Reporting requirements and obligations of a joint-stock company.
Procedures to trade securities, including role of stock exchange,
brokers, banks and others.
i.    Specific procedures relating to other capital market development
initiatives under the project, including the development of the
securities and exchange commission and the development of
securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement facilities.
An important part of this second initiative is a program to
immobilize physical securities and centralize existing share
registries. This will require integration into the campaign.
k.    Basics of investment and portfolio management, including open
and close-ended investment funds, pension funds, etc.
I.    International linkages with the domestic capital market.
16.   The consultant will be responsible for identifying and organizing other
substantive topics as part of their proposal and, in conjunction with Croatian
counterparts, during the conduct of the TA.
17.   In addition to creating the public awareness materials (e.g., camera-ready
print materials and broadcast quality video and audio tapes) during the second
stage, the consultant will also help strengthen the MOP public relations capacity,
by, among other things, helping prepare job descriptions, training and advising
MOP staff, as well as building MOP capacities to conduct and maintain public
surveys.
Deliverables
18.   Deliverables under this TA contract are reports, presentations and printed
and electronic material ready for reproduction and broadcast. In addition to the
monthly progress reports the deliverables (with approximate timings) are:

disbursement, reporting and coordination activities relating to the project components



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 66 --   PIP Annex J: TOR #10
and the relevant interactions between the Government and the World Bank and, as
appropriate, USAID. The Govemment will also establish a Project Steering
Committee, to which most of the TA work under the various components will be
presented for decisions and guidance on matters of policy and substance. In
addition, each of the three project components will have a small team to directly carry
out and manage the detailed work in the components. (See Figure 1 on page 69 for
implementation arrangements.)
Objective of the Work
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the technical assistance (TA)
required to lead the PIU and accordingly, help ensure that project achieves each
of the above three objectives "a", "b" and "c".
General Responsibilities
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the
consultant's client in Croatia.
6.    Qualifications. The consultant will have the following minimum qualifications:
a.    Extensive experience in managing and administering large, multi-
million dollar projects, involving multiple sub-projects, contractors and
agencies.
b.    Experience in project management in both the public and private
sectors.
C.    Experience with competitively bid procurements.
d.    Experience in disbursement and audit procedures.
Desirable qualifications also include:
e.    Demonstrated knowledge of the financial sector and the capital
markets in particular.
f.    Fluency in the Croatian Language.
9.    Experience with World Bank financed projects.
7.    Training, however, will be available on World Bank procurement and
disbursement procedures for the PIU Head and PIU staff. Depending on timing of
project activities, course schedules and developments in other World Bank projects in
Croatia, the training is likely to be a mix of short, one to two week programs overseas
and/or in country. If possible, these will be coordinated with training for the two-
member loan administration team that is expected to established in the Foreign
Relations Department of the MOF under the proposed Technical Assistance Project.
This team and the PIU will coordinate activities. The PIU is likely to be tasked with
managing common procedures among this project and others under consideration.

CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 71 --     PIP Annex K: TOR #11
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Capital Markets Development Project
Terms of Reference #11
Project Steering Committee
DRAFT: February 15, 1996
Background
1.    Croatia's privatization program is central to achieving a sustainable fiscal
balance and economic growth. Like all transforming formerly socialist economies,
Croatia is struggling to devise a strategy that balances equity, economic
efficiency and expediency. The country's weak, incomplete and illiquid capital
markets significantly complicate this problem and constrain the authorities'
options. The absence of appropriate regulation and supervision in the securities
markets are particular concerns, as are the inadequate common "back office"
facilities to support debt and equities trading. Together with the public's poor
understanding of capital markets, these weakness present serious risks to the
ongoing economic transformation program.
2.    Accordingly, the Republic of Croatia has requested a loan of approximately
US$9.5 million equivalent from the World Bank (IBRD) to help finance the costs
of the Capital Markets Development Project. USAID has also pledged
approximately US$1 million in grants to fund selected technical assistance efforts
within the scope of the project. The Capital Markets Development Project will:
a.    Strengthen the legal and policy framework of the capital markets,
including the establishment of the Croatian Securities and
Exchange Commission (CROSEC).
b.    Implement securities depository, registry, clearing and settlement
facilities.
c.    Improve the public's understanding of the capital markets and their
roles as shareholders of privatized firms.
3.    In addition, the project will establish and support a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU). With a staff of about two or three, the PIU will administer the
procurement, disbursement, reporting and coordination activities relating to the



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 72 --   PIP Annex K: TOR #11
project components and the relevant interactions between the Government and
the World Bank and, as appropriate, USAID. The Government will also establish a
Project Steering Committee, to which most of the TA work under the various
components will be presented for decisions and guidance on matters of policy
and substance. In addition, each of the three project components will have a
small team to directly carry out and manage the detailed work in the
components. (See Figure 1 on page 74 for implementation arrangements.)
Objective of the Work
4.    These terms of reference (TOR) cover the roles and responsibilities of the
Project Steering Committee. Thus, the objective of the work is to ensure that the
project successfully achieves each of the above three objectives "a", "b" and "c".
General Responsibilities
5.    Reporting and Communications. The Project Steering Committee (the
Committee) will report to and advise Ministry of Finance (MOF) on matters
relating to the Capital Markets Development Project. The Assistant Minister of
Finance will chair the Committee.
6.    Composition and Qualifications. The Committee will be composed of
senior representatives of the major participants in the Capital Market, such as:
a.    Exchanges
b.    Broker/dealers.
c.    Banks.
d.    Institutional investors.
e.    The enterprise sector / chamber of commerce
f.    Republic and other public bond issuers.
g.    Croatian Fund for Privatization.
h.    Domestic Payment Institute (ZZPP) I National Bank of Croatia.
i.    The legal profession / judicial system .
j.    Financial media.
7.    The Committee will be responsible for reviewing and deliberating upon a
substantial amount of material and presentations that will profoundly shape the
financial system in Croatia. Accordingly, members must be prepared: (i) to
dedicate time and energy to the Committee's work; (ii) to even-handedly
represent the broad community for which they stand; yet, (iii) to represent the
national interest, as it may differ somewhat from the interests of that
community; (iv) to work effectively and consensually with the Committee's
representatives from the other communities within and related to the capital
markets.



CROATIA: Capital Markets Development Project  -- 73 --    PIP Annex K: TOR #11
Scope of Work
8.    Timing. The Committee will form as soon as possible and be active during
the duration of the project, which currently runs through the end of 1998.
9.    Description of Work. The primary function the Committee will be to
gather the wisdom and interests in the Croatian capital markets to guide the
many activities under the three components of the Capital Markets Development
Project: policy support, infrastructure development and public awareness. This
will primarily take place by the Committee (and sub-committees) regularly
meeting to:
a.    Review materials and presentations by the various project teams,
consultants and suppliers (as coordinated by the PIU). Assess the
validity of analyses and the appropriateness of the proposed strategies
and action plans.
b.    Actively participate in any necessary work to revise and refine the
proposals and action plans.
c.    Provide recommendations, guidance and, as appropriate, decision
making on matters of substance and priority which the teams will put
before the Committee (in coordination with the PIU).
d.    Recommend MOF approval/ or rejection of selected far-reaching
documents, such as strategies, action plans and key terms of
reference, technical specifications and other documents.
e.    Assess adequacy of contracted work undertaken. Manage the
project's Mid-Term Review in September 1997.
f.    Help the PIU monitor the substantive progress of the project teams,
consultants and suppliers.
9.    Communicate the project activities and rationales to constituencies
within each committee members community and to the public at large.
10.   Support to the Committee will come in the form of: (i) secretariat services
by the PIU, including the preparation of meeting minutes and circulation of
agendas, management of documents and relevant data, etc.; and (ii) ad hoc
technical assistance and study tours to provide the membership with the
adequate knowledge and exposure to make carefully informed decisions and
recommendations on matters put before the Committee.
