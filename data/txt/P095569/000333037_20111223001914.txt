     ARGENTINA SECOND PHASE (APL2) OF THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY
                  ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER

    A. SUMMARY
    1. The proposed restructuring would trigger the following six safeguards policies:
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Forests (OP 4.36), Pest Management (OP 4.09), Physical
Cultural Resources (OP 4.11), Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) and Involuntary
Resettlement (OP 4.12). Additionally, by approval of the Country Director, the
restructuring (i) supports a minor reallocation of the Loan proceeds; (ii) extends by 18
months the closing date of the Project, from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013, to
allow for completion of planned Project activities; and (iii) introduces minor changes to
Components 2 and 3 of the Project as explained under Section C below.
    2. No other changes are proposed to financing, institutional or fiduciary
arrangements. The Project will remain as “Category B? and the proposed restructuring
does not imply a change to the Project Development Objectives (PDO).


B. PROJECT STATUS
    3. The IBRD Loan in the amount of US$400 million was approved by the Board on
June 28, 2007, and became effective on November 24, 2008. The original closing date of
the Project is December 31, 2011. This first restructuring is in response to the findings of
the Project's mid-term review of June, 2011, and the Borrower's request.
    4. The Project constitutes the second phase1 (APL2) of a program and consists of the
following parts. Part 1 includes the rehabilitation and maintenance of the Non-
Concessioned2 paved National Road Network through the carrying out of: (a) 20
CREMA contracts3 covering a total length of about 3,290 km to be financed with the
proceeds of the Loan, and (b) 50 CREMA contracts covering a total length of about 7,637
km to be financed with local funds. Part 2 includes the restoration of 13 bridges of the
Non-Concessioned National Road Network and the carrying out of engineering studies
for 20 additional bridges located on said network. Part 3 includes the design and
implementation of a large-scale road safety pilot program in 2 corridors of the Non-
Concessioned National Road Network, as well as the upgrading of safety standards of
about 15 selected critical black spots of the Non-Concessioned National Road Network.
Part 4 includes several activities aimed at strengthening DNV’s institutional capacity,
some of which were initiated during the first phase (APL1) of the Program.


1
  The First phase, Loan 7242-AR, closed on August 31, 2010.
2
  At the federal level the Government is currently operating and maintaining high traffic highways through
toll concessions.
3
  CREMA contract means a multi-year performance contract under Part 1 of the Project entered into by
DNV with a private sector contractor which contract obligates the private sector contractor to undertake all
phases of road rehabilitation and maintenance work as a single package, from design and programming of
the works, through the execution of such works, with respect to an identified portion of the Non-
Concessioned National Road Network.
                                                     1
     5. Progress towards achievement of PDOs is viewed as satisfactory while Overall
Implementation Progress is deemed Marginally Satisfactory, largely due to delays in
procurement. To date, the Project has disbursed about 57.7% of available proceeds
(US$230.7 million), and has already met the target of contracting all 20 CREMA
contracts that are financed under the Loan. In addition: (i) 32 CREMA contracts financed
with local funds (about 4,712 km) have already been contracted, 7 are in process to be
awarded (about 1,155 km), while 11 remain to be bid and awarded; (ii) because of the
dramatic increase in the cost of road and bridge works since the appraisal, the 13 bridges
initially targeted need to be reduced to 8, of which 5 have already been contracted, with
the remainder expected to be bid in the first quarter of 2012; (iii) two pilot road safety
corridors have been designed and, while updating of cost estimates is underway, it is
foreseen that costs have increased and, thus, considering the amount of available funds,
only one corridor can be implemented; (iv) 4 contracts for the upgrading of critical spots
are ready to be bid (the 15 black spots contracts initially contemplated need to be reduced
to 7, also because of the increase in the cost of road works and the resulting constrained
loan amount); and (v) most activities under the institutional component have been
initiated and or concluded.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES
Components
    6. Component 2 – Bridge Restoration. Because of cost escalations, the bridge
component needs to be scaled back. Rather than restore 13 bridges, only 8 bridges will be
restored. Also, engineering design studies for 20 bridges of the non-concessioner national
network originally envisaged to be funded under the Project remain part of the Project but
will now be done by DNV in-house.
    7. Component 3 – Road Safety. While a large scale road safety pilot program in two
corridors of the non-concessioned national road network has been designed, only one of
the two corridors will be implemented because of an increase in the cost of road works
and the resulting constrained loan amount. Due to the same reason, rather than the
expected upgrading of 15 selected critical black-spots, only 7 will be upgraded.
    8. The corresponding change in results indicators is presented in Annex1.
Safeguards
    9. At the time of appraisal the only safeguard policy envisioned was OP 4.01 –
Environmental Assessment. Following review of existing and particularly remaining
planned mallas4 and bridge restoration to be tendered under Part 1 (b) and Part 2 of the
Project, it is found that there is a need to trigger 6 additional OPs through this proposed
restructuring. The project continues to be classified as Category B.
   10. Of a group of 8 mallas (financed with local funds) and one bridge bidding
document revised by the team, all triggered the restructuring and the Environmental



4
 The term “malla? is the Argentinean reference to those specific segments of the road network that are bid
out as a CREMA contracts.
                                                    2
Policies recommended to be triggered, except the Natural Habitats Safeguard which is
triggered only by Malla 114.
    11. A total of 11 mallas and three bridges remain to be bid and awarded for the
restructured phase under the new guidelines developed. DNV will ensure that the project
would have regular environmental supervision by qualified environmental specialists.
    12. DNV operates according to an Updated Environmental Management and
Evaluation Manual, (“MEGA?, Manual de Evaluación y Gestión Ambiental), dated from
1993 and updated in 2007. The updated MEGA Manual was reviewed by the Bank at that
time and was considered to be congruent with the Bank’s own environmental policies and
for the type of mallas evaluated and agreed at appraisal of the APL2, which did not
include environmentally sensitive areas.
    13. According to the MEGA manual and screening procedures, consultations are only
required for new roads, not for the malla contracts. However, in the case of mallas
crossing sensitive areas such as national parks or cultural protected areas, DNV consults
the National Park Authority or the Provincial Cultural Resources Authority. Also in most
mallas, the municipality and other local authorities are consulted to avoid impact on
public services.
   14. The Operational Manual will be revised and updated to include an updated
environmental checklist and agreed additional environmental procedures for the
remaining mallas and bridge contracts to be awarded.

Safeguard Policies to be triggered       Explanation
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04)               Malla 114 (to be awarded), crosses the National
                                         Park Nahual Huapi
Forests (OP 4.36)                        Possible commercial use wood from bush-tree
                                         clearance. Reforestation activities are developed in
                                         some mallas.
Pest Management (OP 4.09)                Use of agro-chemicals permitted in maintenance of
                                         vegetation along right of way of the mallas
Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11)    Excavations are common activities during slope
                                         and shoulders conformations and other malla
                                         operations.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.10)             Malla 130 (to be awarded) is found to traverse an
                                         area with indigenous population
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12)       Through supervision it was discovered that some
                                         limited resettlement had already taken place or will
                                         take place at 6 locations on 2 mallas.

   15. The MEGA establishes environmental procedures for road rehabilitation and
construction, including the elaboration by contractors of an Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) that must comply with the provisions of the Updated Environmental
Evaluation and Management Manual. The EMP is implemented by contractors while
DNV regional environmental units (CEGA) provide overall supervision. Also, bidding
documents prepared by DNV include environmental clauses, which follow MEGA
procedures. With the new 8 mallas and one bridge restoration plan, the team has provided
                                            3
DNV with additional environmental recommendations in the bidding documents,
especially for the preparation and implementation of the EMP. Therefore, subject to
DNV’s adherence to (i) its own Manual; (ii) additional recommendations in the bidding
documents; and (iii) increase environmental supervision by environmental specialists at
CEGA, environmental safeguards policies of the Bank would be satisfactorily addressed.
The Operational Manual for the project will be updated to include the MEGA.
    16. The proposed approach would apply to all subprojects in the operation and DNV
will be applying the existing MEGA manual in the project and additional environmental
recommendations.
   17. In those cases where preparation for bidding is well advanced DNV is already
applying the safeguard policies now being triggered, including incorporating additional
Bank’s recommendations regarding these safeguards.
    18. Natural Habitats (OP 4.04). Malla 114, which has not yet been awarded, crosses
National Park Nahuel Huapi. Also other mallas which are already under contract might
cross other conservation management categories such as the Malla 432 (Jujuy) under
implementation, which crosses the Cultural Protected area “Quebrada de Humahuaca
Patrimonio de la Humanidad (Volcán – Tres Cruces).? DNV environmental assessment
of Mallas within protected areas follows a standard checklist approved by the Bank, a
consultation by the National Environmental Authority and approved intervention,
Environmental clauses linked to the MEGA in the Bidding document and the preparation
of an EMP prepared by the contractor. Also, during implementation, the contractor will
need to hire an environmental professional for the implementation of the EMP. CEGA
and the National Park representatives will conduct periodic supervision.
   19. An Agreement of cooperation (Convenio Marco) between the National Park
Authority and DNV was signed in 1979 and updated and reviewed in 2006 in order to
supervise and control interventions in protected areas and reduce environmental impact.
    20. Under the “Convenio Marco?, the APN has reviewed the bidding document and
provided its no-objection to the works of Malla 114. APN has requested different
measures for contractors to remove exotic tree species and re-vegetation of intervened
areas with native species. In addition, the bidding documents of Malla 114 clearly state
that contractor will have to follow the National Park environmental management plan and
any other Park regulations or requirement in place for the protected area including, if
requested, an EIA. The road section of Malla 114 has already been under malla contract
during the first CREMA contracts of DNV with support from the Bank (in the latter
1990s).
    21. Forests (OP 4.36). Some malla contracts will include the clearing of vegetation
and reforestation activities in the right of ways. In DNV bidding documents it is
identified that DNV is the owner of all material resulting from bush and tree clearance.
DNV either disposes of this material or requests contractors to cut viable species on
commercial dimensions to harvest some of trees species. Many times, DNV will donate
the wood to the Municipality or the community.
    22. Some malla contracts request contractors to undertake reforestation and
afforestation activities in specific road sections. The MEGA includes recommendations
for contractors to develop reforestation activities, which are particularly important near
                                            4
rivers and forested areas These measures includes the use of native species and nursery
and plantation development. These forest restoration and afforestation activities are
consistent with Bank Policy to increase or maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions
in the project area.
    23. In Malla 114, the National Park Authority has authorized the cutting of 56.5 ha
along the road to extract pine trees since this is an exotic species. Also in some areas due
to security reasons and shoulder stabilization works, some protected tree species will
need to be cut and removed. The cutting of trees within the protected area will be
individually marked by the Park personnel to avoid impact on other protected species.
Also the contract includes activities of reforestation in specific sections of the malla.
    24. DNV uses in the road signs poles of several endangered native trees species and
the team has advised DNV of the possibility to exchange them for planted species such as
eucalyptus. DNV is reviewing the proposal.
     25. Pest Management (OP 4.09). Contractors are permitted to use agro-chemicals in
the maintenance of vegetation along the mallas. DNV already has provisions in the
MEGA to supervise the use of the herbicides and banned those classified as very toxic
(Ia, Ib and II) according to the WHO.
    26. Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11). CREMA contracts might include
excavation activities related to slope and shoulders conformation, realignment of river
banks and realignment of roads. These excavations in some cases might have the
possibility of disrupting cultural or paleontological artifacts. Some mallas might also
cross rich archaeological-cultural sites such as Malla 403 (Catamarca, La Rioja) and
Malla 432 (Jujuy) “Quebrada de Humahuaca Patrimonio de la Humanidad (Volcán –
Tres Cruces).
    27. The bidding document for Malla 432 (National Route 9) includes clauses for the
contractors to avoid damages to cultural resources and chance findings procedures,
including a “Programa de Protección del Patrimonio Cultural: Control de afectación del
patrimonio arqueológico, paleontológico y de minerales de interés científico, patrimonio
escénico monumental, arquitectónico, urbanístico, histórico y antropológico social en
general.? Also DNV Regional Office consulted the EMP prepared by the contractor with
the “Unidad de Gestión Quebrada de Humahuaca? in charge of the management of the
“Quebrada de Humahuaca, patrimonio Mundial- Paisaje Cultural?
    28. In future Mallas, DNV will follow the same procedure of consultation to the
Provincial National Cultural Resources Authority, implementing recommendations of
this Authority and chance finding procedures in the bidding documents. These
procedures are consistent with Bank policy as well as national and provincial laws and
regulations pertaining to physical cultural resources. The MEGA manual describe chance
findings procedures for contractor to reduce impact on cultural resources. (Annex VI).
The team has advised DNV to increase supervision of contractors across the provinces to
comply with these procedures.
    29. Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10). When revising the bid documents received for
launching Malla 130 in the Province of Neuquen, it was established that the road passes
through an area where an indigenous population is present. DNV is preparing an
Indigenous Peoples Plan to address this case and has conducted consultations with the
                                             5
indigenous communities affected. These consultations have informed an Indigenous
Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) prepared by DNV to address future cases where
indigenous peoples may be affected. The IPPF was disclosed locally and in InfoShop on
December 15, 2011. Investment in those roads will not be effected until the Bank has had
an opportunity to review and accept the resulting Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP). The
Operational Manual for the Project will be updated to include the IPPF.
    30. Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). At the time of appraisal, resettlement was not
anticipated, and therefore OP 4.12 was not triggered. The Project Appraisal Document
(PAD – No 39716-AR dated May 31, 2007) specifically established that “impacts of road
rehabilitation and maintenance operations on the local population is expected to be
minimal, as most of the network under CREMA operations affect well established inter-
urban highways passing through sparsely populated areas. The Project entails
rehabilitation works on the road network and construction works on bridges, both to be
carried out only within the existing right-of-way where no resettlements are expected.
Therefore the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policy will not be triggered?.
    31. During supervision it was found that involuntary resettlement indeed occurred in
4 cases and that it is likely to occur in 2 additional cases (see Table 2). The client only
realized that resettlement was required after works on the malla had started. These cases
involve minor taking of land and relocation of informal businesses.

       32. At the request of the Bank, DNV has documented all cases or RoW acquisition or
   displacement of occupants of the RoW and has prepared a Remedial Action Plan to
   ensure compliance with OP 4.12. In addition, DNV has prepared a Resettlement Policy
   Framework (RPF) for addressing future resettlement cases and two Abbreviated
   Resettlement Plans will be prepared for the two identified future cases. This framework
   has been reviewed by the Bank and is found to be acceptable. The Operational Manual
   will be updated to include the RPF. The Bank plans to conduct with DNV training or
   workshop to heighten awareness of proper adherence to resettlement policies and
   practices. Both the Remedial Action Plan and the RPF have been disclosed locally and in
   InfoShop on December 15, 2011.
   Reallocation
       33. The proposed reallocation of Loan Proceeds is due to higher than expected cost of
   purchase and installation of goods, specifically Videoconference equipment for the DNV
   geographic districts and axle load control system (Sistema WIN). The estimated total cost
   of both amounts to US$3.0 million. The proposal is to reallocate US$2.5 million from
   Category 1 (b) (rehabilitation work) to Category 2 (goods), as shown in Table 3.

   Closing Date
       34. Aside from delay in effectiveness of the loan, the main factors that have affected
   the pace of implementation have been delays in the design, preparation, and evaluation of
   bids as well as in the awards of contracts. Those delays were further compounded during
   2008 and 2009 by delays in provision of counterpart funding. .
       35. At client’s request the closing date of the Project will be extended by 18 months
   from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2013, to allow for completion of planned Project
   activities.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
36. Aside from the slightly reduced scope explained regarding the change in components,
    no changes in impact from the original Appraisal of the Project is expected from this
    restructuring. The PDO are still achievable. Therefore, an updated appraisal is not
    deemed to be required.
