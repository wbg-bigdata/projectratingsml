                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to further develop and implement an efficient road network management strategy, bringing about the necessary resources to
                         preserve the national road network in the long term. This is a key condition towards increasing the competitiveness of the economy and supporting a sustainable path of
                         economic growth and poverty reduction:
                          a.       Preserve the condition of vital road assets, through the gradual expansion of performance-based contracts for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the non-
                         concessioned primary paved network;
                          b.       Strengthen road sector management through carrying out a renewal program of DNV to revitalize its role in the sector by: (i) reinforcing its human resource
                         base, (ii) consolidating its transformation into a results-oriented organization accountable for specific outputs; (iii) introducing a systematic approach to bridge
                         management and (iv) enhancing road safety.
