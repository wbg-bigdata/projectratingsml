                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to further develop and implement an efficient road network management strategy, bringing about the necessary resources to
                         preserve the national road network in the long term. This is a key condition towards increasing the competitiveness of the economy and supporting a sustainable path of
                         economic growth and poverty reduction: a.                Preserve the condition of vital road assets, through the gradual expansion of performance-based contracts for the
                         rehabilitation and maintenance of the non-concessioned primary paved network; b. Strengthen road sector management through carrying out a renewal program of DNV
                         to revitalize its role in the sector by: (i) reinforcing its human resource base, (ii) consolidating its transformation into a results-oriented organization accountable for
                         specific outputs; (iii) introducing a systematic approach to bridge management and (iv) enhancing road safety.

                         The project has been effective since November 28, 2008. During this period US$370.5 million have been disbursed (93% of total) mainly under the CREMA component. Progress to
                         date includes: (i) 3,327 km of CREMA being financed under this loan; (ii) 6,228 km of CREMA being financed under client own resources; (iii) 1,547 km of CREMA under bidding
                         process; (iv) 5 bridges under execution, and 1 recently awarded; (v) several road safety interventions in critical black spot being awarded; and (vi) several activities under Institutional
                         Renewal component under implementation. Overall, it is estimated that project implementation will allow to achieve targets for the CREMA and Institutional Renewal components.
