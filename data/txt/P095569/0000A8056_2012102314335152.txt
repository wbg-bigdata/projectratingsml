                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The overall purpose of the program is to further develop and implement an efficient road network management strategy, bringing about the necessary resources to
                         preserve the national road network in the long term. This is a key condition towards increasing the competitiveness of the economy and supporting a sustainable path of
                         economic growth and poverty reduction:
                          a.       Preserve the condition of vital road assets, through the gradual expansion of performance-based contracts for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the non-
                         concessioned primary paved network;
                          b.       Strengthen road sector management through carrying out a renewal program of DNV to revitalize its role in the sector by: (i) reinforcing its human resource
                         base, (ii) consolidating its transformation into a results-oriented organization accountable for specific outputs; (iii) introducing a systematic approach to bridge
                         management and (iv) enhancing road safety.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has been effective since November 28, 2008. During this period US$315.2 million have been disbursed (79% of total) mainly under the CREMA component. Progress to
                         date includes: (i) 3,327 km of CREMA being financed under this loan; (ii) 4,868 km of CREMA being financed under client own resources; (iii) 1,912 km of CREMA under bidding
                         process; (iv) 5 bridges under execution and 2 additional being designed; (v) several road safety interventions in critical black spot being awarded; and (vi) several activities under

                         Institutional Renewal component under implementation. Overall, it is estimated that project implementation will allow to achieve targets for the CREMA and Institutional Renewal
                         components. Concrete actions are required to satisfactorily achieve the targets for the Bridge and Road Safety components. In that regard, an Action Plan was agreed during last
                         supervision mission; the Plan will be closely follow-up in the upcoming months.

                         The project was restructured in order to: (i) extend the closing date (from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2013); (ii) reallocate funds among categories; (iii) modify the scope of
                         activities described in the Loan Agreement to reflect current targets; and (iv) trigger 6 operational safeguards. The amendment reflecting this restructuring was countersigned on
                         August 2012. A supervision mission was carried out in June 2012.
