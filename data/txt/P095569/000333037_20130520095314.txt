2.     The IBRD Loan in the amount of US$400 million was approved by the Board on
June 28, 2007, and became effective on November 24, 2008. The Loan was restructured
in 2012 to trigger several new safeguards and the closing date was extended by 18
months to June 30, 2013. This will be the second extension of the project for cumulative
extensions of 21 months.

3.      Progress towards achievement of PDOs is viewed as satisfactory while Overall
Implementation Progress is deemed Marginally Satisfactory. To date the project has
disbursed about 87.9% of available proceeds (US$351.4 million), and has already met the
target of contracting all 20 CREMA1 contracts that are financed under the Loan
(component representing 90% of Loan proceeds). In addition the Borrower was
envisaged to contract 50 additional CREMA with local funds. The status of these is as
follows: 8 mallas2 from APL1 almost completed; 32 mallas procured and under
execution; 5 mallas under bidding process, and 5 mallas to be bid shortly.

4.       Regarding the bridges component (the target is 8 bridges) the situation is as
follows: 5 bridges under construction, 1 under bidding process and 1 to be bid shortly.
The road safety pilot including the program for spot improvement is ongoing and the
pilot corridor in under bidding process with local funds. Finally, activities under
institutional component have been successfully completed.

5.    The proposed extension is needed to advance further the results of the
components related to bridges and more importantly road safety.

6.      The proposed reallocation is necessary because some bidding processes (purchase
of VC and Weigh-in-Motion WIM equipment) could not take place because of current
conditions and restrictions in the country regarding imported equipment. All funds
allocated to goods are therefore reallocated towards the CREMA component under
Category 1 (b). Another reallocation is the one related to consultants’ services. At project
design it was envisaged to hire consultants to design bridges, but during project
implementation it was decided that studies will be carried out in-house. Proceeds were
also reallocated towards Category 1(b). Finally, since the pilot corridor for road safety
was delayed (mainly because of delays in reaching the final design), it will be bid with
local funds. Proceeds were reallocated towards Category 1(b). As a result, the allocation
to CREMAs (Category 1 (b)) increased from US$251.25 to US$281.5 million (12%
increase).

  CREMA contract means a multi-year performance contract under Part 1 of the Project entered into by
DNV with private sector contractor which contract obligated the private sector contractor to undertake all
phases of road rehabilitation and maintenance work as a single package, from design and programming of
the works, though the execution of such works, with respect to an identified portion of the non-
concessioned national road network.

  The term “malla? is the Argentinean reference to those specific segments of the road network that are bid
out as Crema Contracts
