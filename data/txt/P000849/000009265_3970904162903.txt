ASHANTI REGION COCOA PROJECT
(Loan 1181-GH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a completion report on the Ashanti Region Cocoa Project,
which was identified by the Government of Ghana (GOG) and formulated on the
basis of the experiences gained in the Eastern Region Cocoa Project (ERCP).
The Bank, with the help of the R?WA office and consultants, assisted GOG in
further preparing the project and after a pre-appraisal in November 1974 and
an updating mission in May 1975, approved loan 1181-GH for US$14.0 million in
December 1975. An additional loan from the Arab Bank for Economic Development
in Africa (BADEA), equivalent to US$5.0 million, was granted in September
1976. The Bank loan was initially anticipated to close by December 1978 but
after three extensions finally closed in December 1982. With final
disbursements on June 30, 1983, the loan was fully disbursed.
This completion report was prepared by the Western Africa Regional
Office and is based on a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 827a-GH of
November 18, 1975), President's Report (No. P-1687-GH of December 8, 1975),
Loan Agreement (dated December 23, 1975), supervision reports, and the
findings of a completion mission to Ghana in June 1983. The P- ect
Performance Audit Report (OED Report No. 3526 dated June 24, 1981) on the
preceding project - Ghana, Eastera Region Cocoa Project (Cr. 205-GH) - was
also consulted. During the completion mission, discussions on various aspects
were held with project staff and project farmers were also interviewed during
field visits.  A complet-ion report of reasonably good quality was also
prepared by the Project Unit and is available in West Africa Information
Center.
We gratefully acknowledge the valuable assistance provided by the
Government, particularly the project manager and his staff, whose assistance
contributed greatly to this report.
The PCR was completed on December 30, 1983, and submitted to OED.
The project was not selected for audit by OED and the PCR was sent to the
Borrower for comments on March 7, 1984. Comments received from the Ashanti
Cocoa Project JUnit have been taken into account and are attached to the PCR.

GHANA
ASHANTI REGION COCOA PROJECT
(Loan 1181-GH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
In the early seventies cocoa accounted for 62% of Ghana's foreign
exchange earnings, but despite its importance, the cocoa sector was
declining. In retrospect, the major reasons for the decline were low real
producer prices, shortages of inputs, deterioration of the transportation
network and inefficiencies of the marketing system. In volume terms, Ghana's
average annual production declined from about 450,000 long tons during
1960/61-1964/65 to about 400,000 long tons during 1965/66-1972/73 and was
about 350,000 long tons in the 1973/74 crop year. Alarmed by the apparent
trend of declining production GOG requested Bank assistance in replanting and
rehabilitating cocoa plantings in the Eastern Region which materialized in a
Bank financing of the Eastern Region Cocoa Project (CR 205-GH) for the five
years 1970/71 to 1974/75.
Recognizing the continuing importance of cocoa in the Ghanian economy
the Bank responded favorably to a second request for financial assistance by
GOG to resuscitate the cocoa industry. This time the proposed area of
activity was the Ashanti Region - Ghana's most important cocoa area. However,
there would be little justification for the Bank financing unless the project
could be seen as a 'time-slice' operation of a long-term cocoa development
program with repeat operations in later years. Due to the high inflation rate
at the time of designing the project, which made estimating costs subject to
much error and would have required an inordinately high provision for price
contingencies, it was deemed justified to confine the project to three years
only, i.e., until the first fruit-bearing, instead of full maturity, which
would have needed a seven-year period.
The project aimed at replanting 42,500 acres 1/ on the basis of the
provision of credit to smallholder cocoa farmers for hliring labor and to cover
the cost of production inputs provided in kind by the project; the farmer was
supposed to put in 20 percent of the total labor by himself. The reality was
that the project had to provide all labor, because of lack of farmer
interest. Also, because of farmer disinterest, the project could not hand
over the replanted areas to farmers for further maintenance and thus was
1/   Originally, the project replanting target was 30,000 acres, but
some six months after effectiveness, BADEA funds were added on a joint
basis and the project target revised to 42,500 acres.



iv -
obliged to add four more years to bring each replanted area to maturity.
Evidence now shows that farmers are even reluctant to harvest their cocoa
plantings which are close to maturity.
The principal reason for this lack of interest was low real producer
prices for cocoa both in absolute terms and relative to prices of competing
crops. Moreover, with the deteriorating national economy a huge out-migration
of skilled and unskilled labor took place causing labor shortages for cocoa
maintenance and harvesting which were normally carried out by sharecroppers.
In addition, the farmowner and his family were busy producing food crops to
satisfy household food requirements and the need for daily household items,
such as kerosene, soap, matches, salt, etc.
Due to low farmer participation and consequent slow achievement of
planting targets, the project implementation period was extended from 3 to 7
years. At close in December, 1982, the project had achieved about 90% of the
planting target (38,000 acres out of 42,500 projected at appraisal). Due to
the substantial time over-run as well as the persistently high inflation (not
offset by exchange rate adjustment) which Ghana experienced during the
implementation period, the project costs were 0149 million ($65.7 million)
compared to the appraisal estimate of 025 million ($21.9 million), a 490%
increase in terms of cedis and a 200% increase in dollar terms.
The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) re-estimated at completion is 13%
compared to the appraisal estimate of 21%. This is based on the assumption,
considered reasonable at this stage, that, as a result of the current sectoral
rehabilitation efforts, particularly adjustment of producer prices, farmers
will resume proper maintenance and harvesting of project planted farms. If
this situation does not materialize and the project staff continue to maintain
cocoa plantations, with a much lower efficiency, then the ERR would drop to
about 5%. The ERR in both cases would have been much higher if the harmattan
and bush fires in early 1983 had not destroyed about 30% of the project
planted farms.
As with the preceding Eastern Region Cocoa Project (ERCP), the
principal lessons that emerge from the experience of this project are that it
is almost impossible to ensure successful project implementation when major
sector issues, which have a direct bearing on project success, remain
unresolved and that small, geographically-confined projects are usually
ineffective vehicles for addressing and resolving major sector issues. This
lesson has been taken into account in the Export Rehabilitation Project
(approved by the Board on January 3, 1984) which seeks to deal with the issues
in the cocoa sector (principally adjustment of producer prices and reform of
institutions responsible for marketing, input supply and extension) on a
broad-based, sectoral level, link it with macro-economic measures and attempt
to implement a comprehensive reform package.
Other points of interest are:
- farm labor availability remained a problem (paras 3.04, 6.16-
6.19);
- no serious efforts have been made for credit recovery



(para 3.10);
-  responses to fertilizer applications by young cocoa are  small,
inconsistent and uneconomic (para 4.06);
-  training of middle level staff not beneficial to the project
as most trainees left the project for better paying jobs (para
5.03);
-  the Bank underestimated the complexities of resolving major
sect3ral issues, such as producer prices (paras 7.03 and 8.02);
-  an important consideration before the Bank in extending
the project completion date was continued presence in the most
important sector in Ghana and to endeavor to use the project
as a leverage for resolving major sector issues (para 7.04); and
-  of the six assurances sought from the Government during
negotiations in October 1975, none had been fulfilled by the
deadline of December 31, 1976 (para 7.06).



GHANA
ASHANTI REGION COCOA PROJECT
(Loan 1181-GH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01     Sector Background:  The Ashanti Region Cocoa Project (ARCP) formed
part of a first phase of a program to rehabilitate the cocoa industry of the
Ashanti region, and an integral part of the 0overnment of Ghana's overall
strategy to revamp the country's cocoa industry. At the time of project
formulation, about a quarter of the country's total population or 2.5 million
people were directly involved in cocoa farming, with the sector accounting for
between 60-70 percent of foreign exchange earnings and over 30 percent of
government revenues. The cocoa sector still accounts for over 60% of foreign
exchange earnings of Ghana and provides employment to about 24% of the labor
force.
1.02     However, despite its overriding importance, the sector has been
experiencing a secular decline over the past decade or so. This could be
interpreted in the wider historical context of production trends over the last
50 years. First, there was the broad period from around 1932/33 - 1959/60
when production levels stabilized around 200,000 - 300,000 tons. This period
also witnessed a decline in real producer prices up to the mid-1940s, due to
the low international prices resulting from World War II; however, prices
doubled during the mid-1940s and stayed at a relatively high level until the
1960s. The second broad bistorical period - 1960/61-1975/76 - was marked by
large increases in production which fluctuated at relatively high levels
between 350,000 - 450,000 tons. This was a result of new plantings and good
husbandry practices stemming from attractive price increases.
1.03     Diring the third broad period - 1976/77 to the present time -
production declined from around the 400,000 ton-level achieved in the early
1970s to the current level of about 180,000 tons. As recognized in the
Appraisal Report, this progressive decline in production was caused by the
interplay of at least six sets of factors: (1) low real producer prices; (2)
the inadequate and erratic input distribution system; (3) the spread of
Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (SSVD); (4) the unfavorable age profile of cocoa
trees due to an excessive component of over-aged trees; (5) the deteriorating
transportation system, and resultant difficulties in evacuating cocoa from
producing areas to ports; and (6) the lack of a consistent overall development
plan for the cocoa sector. In addition, the institutional network for
provision of inputs, extension and credit and the evacuation of the produce
lacked efficiency and effectiveness caused, among other factors, by
dissension between the Kinistry of Cocoa Affairs and the Ghana Cocoa Marketing
Board.
1.04     On account of the above-mentioned factors, Ghana, which was for
several decades the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa and cocoa
products, is now the world's third largest producer and exporter, behind Ivory



-2-
Coast and Brazil (Annex I, Table 1).  Further, the experience during the past
two decades reveals not only a rapidly declining export performance, but also
the worst export record among the major producing countries (Annex I, Table
2).
1.05     Sector Strategy and Bank Groop Lending:  It is against this
background that the Government of Ghana initiated a set of policies during the
early 1970s aimed at resuscitating the cocoa sector through: (a)
intensification of an ongoing replanting program; (b) promotion of research
and extension servicAs; (c) provision of financial relief to farmers in debt
through the provision of credit; and (d) assisting farmers in obtaining labor
and other inputs at subsidized rates.
1.06     As a part of the overall resuscitation efforts, an IDA credit of
US$8.5 million was provided in 1970 for the rehabilitation and replanting of
cocoa farm lands in the Suhum area of the Eastern region of Ghana (Eastern
Region Cocoa Project - (ERCP): Credit 205-GIt' (signed on June 26, 1970). The
ARCP (Loan 1181-GH dated December 23, 1975) was therefore the second Bank-
financed project aimed at reversing the decline in the cocoa sector through a
rejuvenation program of cocoa plantings. It was the sixth Bank Group lending
operation for agriculture in Ghana.  Besides the ERCP  others included:
Credit 163-GH for a Fisheries Pro,ect signed in 19694, Credit 354-GH for a
Sugar Rehabilitati4n Project' signed in January 1973, Credit 500-GH for a
Livestog5  Project4- signed in July 1974 and Credit 531-GH for an Oil Palm
Project..  signed in March 1975.
II.  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Chronology
2.01     The ERCP vas premised on the need to rehabilitate cocoa farm lands
which were extensively devastated by swollen shoot virua disease and to
rehabilitate those farms which were in a state of neglect due to a lack of
farmer interest and the unavailability of production inputs. A similar
strategy was used in the design of the ARCP since similar problems existed in
the Ashanti region.
2.02     As a first step, in 1970, the Government of Ghana commissioned the
Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) of the
University of Ghana to conduct a survey of the Ashanti region as a means of
providing data on the extent of the devastation, as well as other information
which could be used for effective project planning. The Bank was also

approached to assist in project preparation. As a result, a pre-appraisal
mission visited Ghana in October/November 1974, and an appraisal mission in
May 1975.
B. Project Design and Objectives
2.03     Project Design:  The basic project design was similar to that of the
ERCP; however, the ARCP took into consideration lessons learned from the
former project and some improvements were incorporated. In perspective, the
main components of the ERCP were as follows: (i) rehabilitating 51,000 acres
of existing low-yielding cocoa and replanting 36,000 acres on which cocoa had
died out; (ii) training farmers in modern cocoa production techniques; (iii)
improving marketing cooperatives through. the provision of technical
assistance; (iv) establishing a project administration within the Ministry of
Agriculture to plan and manage the project; and (v) resurfacing some 100 miles
of feeder roads in the project area. However, implementation of this project
was adversely affected by factors such as poor farmer participation, a large
number of absentee landlords, problems of procurement of sprayers and
insecticides, the absence of a mechanism for project evaluation, and the lack
of expertise in the inspection unit which was provided for in the project. As
a result, the design of the ARCP made adequate provisions for improvements in
the mode of procurement of insecticides and sprayers, the organization and
staffing of an inspectorate section within the Project Unit CPU), and the
provision for project evaluation. Most importantly, the ratio between
catchment area and project area was substantially increased. The ERCP project
has suffered from a shortage of resident farmers available and willing to
participate in the replanting program. This was largely due to the limited
catchment area (a total of 57,000 acres to be replanted or rehabilitated out
of a total area of 146,000 acres). Preliminary reports on the Ashanti region
by ISSER and the Soil Research Institute indicated that similar problems might
be encountered in the new project area. To combat this, the catchment area
had been increased very considerably in the Ashanti project (30,000 acres 1/
to be replanted out of a total area of 1.3 million acres).
2.04     Project Objectives.  As indicated earlier, the project was to be a
first phase of a program geared towards revitalizing the cocoa industry in the
Ashanti region. It was to be carried out over a three-year period - 1975/76 -
1977/78. The design included both physical and institutional components, as
!ollows:
(a) provision of credit to smallholder cocoa farmers for hiring
labor and provision of farm inputs in kind for replanting of
30,000 acres and their maintenance during the project period;
(b) training of farmers and project staff in modern cocoa production
techniques and practices;
I/   The figure of 30,000 acres was increased to 42,500 acres some seven
months after the project became effective, when additional financing was
obtained from BADEA (para 3.02).

(c) provision of equipment for the maintenance of feeder roads and
the planning of fature feeder road imprOvement;
(d) designing a survey of the cocoa sector with a viev to
formalating an overall development plan for the cocoa sector,
with provisions for the evaluation of project progress; and
(e)  establishment of a project administration within the Ninistry of
Cocoa Affairs (MCA) to plan and manage the project.
2.05     Project Area:   The project area would be the three main cocoa
growing zoaes in Eastern Ashanti - Manmpong, Konongo, and Bekwai, covering a
total area of 1.3 million acres. The conditions of the cocoa plantings at the
time of appraisal were as follows:
Condition            Acreage            Percentage
Good                 799,559.0             60.4
Fair                 402,653.0             30.5
Poor                  94,602.0              7.1
Dying                 27,081.0              2.0
Total              1,323,895.0            100.0
Source: MCA - Interim Report on Intensive Cocoa Survey. February 1978.
One has to note that some 122,000 acres were poor or dying cocoa. A soil
survey of the region, carried oat by the Ghanaian Soil Research Institute,
indicated that around 940,000 acres of the soil is good or very good for
cocoa.
2.06     Project Phasing. The project was to be phased as follows:
Bank Loan Disbursement period            Additional time required to bring all
plantings to maturity
year 1     year 2    year 3      year 4      year 5     year 6    year 7
(a)    acres to be replanted
4,000      10,000     16,000
(b)    acres to be maintained
4,000     14,000     30,000     30,000      26,000     16,000
It was therefore envisaged that replanting would be spread over three years,
with Bank loan disbursemeat covering this period. Further, since cocoa takes
about four years to come into bearing, it was reasoned that another four years
would be needed to maintain the entire 30,000 acres to maturity, - a total of
seven years as shown in the above schedule.
2.07     The rationale for confining the proposed loan to the first 3 years'



-5-
disbursements lies in the fact that inflation in Ghana was running close to 20
percent per .nnum; this would make estimating costs over a seven year period
subject to much error, would require the inclusion in project costs of an
inordinately high provision for price contingencies,and would result, in the
case of a se-en year disbursement period, in the tying up of a very large
proportion of the Bank loan for a long period of time (t;e commitment charges
paid by Ghana would be correspondingly heavy). Moreover, the Government
assured the Bank that the additional cost required 1o maintain all project
plantings till full maturity (that is in project years 4 to 7), estimated at
about USS28 million at the time of appraisal, would be fully met between the
farmers and the Government. However, when after three years only some 50% of
the target area was replanted and 60% of the funds still undisbursed, the Bank
decided to continue financing on the grounds that economic conditions could
improve, so as to make maintenance of cocoa by farmers a real possibility
(para 3_05).
2.08     Credit. On the basis of an average estimated acreage of 3.0 acres
per farmer participant, the project was expected to involve about 14,000
farmers, with credit requirements as follows:
Years                      1           2            3             Total
Cedis per acre            216        78                            3 361
These amounts were to cover 80 percent of labor COS .3 and 100 percent of the
cost of materials.  To be eligible for credit, the farmer participant was
expected to satisfy the following conditions:
(a)   reside on, or within 5 miles of the land to be replanted, and
be prepared to work actively and regularly on the land;
(b)   be a member of a primary cocoa cooperative marketing society,
or Produce Buying Divisicn Farmers' society; and
(c)   establish a firm proprietary right to the land to be replanted.
The residency and active participation conditions were meant to eliminate
absentee farmers, as well as ensure that farmer participants contributed a
full 20 percent of total labor time to the replanting program.
2.09     Farmer participants would receive credit for the first three years of
each planting (shown in the schedule above), and -he terms of the loan would
be 18 years with both principal and interest payments beginning in the 7th
year. Interest, at not less than 8 percent, would be capitalized over the
grace period of 6 years. Credit would be channeled by the PU to members of
cooperatives or the Produce Buying Agency (PBA) societies, as the case may be,
with the latter organizations responsible for debt collection, and retaining 2
percent or a quarter of the 8 percent rate for credit administration.
2.10     Organization and Management.  The project was to be implemented by a
semi-autonomous project unit within the MCA.  Overall project management and
control were to be exercised by a Project Manager, a Deputy Project Manager, a
Pinancial Controller, an Administrative Officer, Project Accountant, Credit'



-6-
Officer, Internal Auditor, Cooperative Officer, Rngineering Superintendent and
supporting staff. The project unit would be adequately staffed to give
technical assistance to farmers, to administer the credit fund, process credit
applications, make loans, supervise debt collections, maintain project account
and far  records, liaise with cooperatives and PBA and undertake a feeder road
study -1 The staffing ratio for technical staff was set at one field
assistant for 33 farmers, and one farm inspection assistant for 50 farmers; an
intensity wbich was thought to be required in case participating farmers were
spread thinly over the project area.  Most staff would be recruited from MCA
which had a considerable staff surplus.
2.11     Negotiations. Loan negotiations were held in Washington from October
20 to 31, 1975. Based on the experiences gained in the ERCP, the Bank's
involvement for the second time in the Ghanaian cocoa sector was dependent on
a new commitment by Government to redress the previous decade's neglect.
Among steps Government was seen to be taking were a reorganization into one
ministry of the various agencies responsible for cocoa. The Bank identified
further areas which required attention, and which became assurances for the
Loan. These were:
(C)   A study of the cocoa producer price policy and submission to
IERD by December 31, 1976 of a proposed statement of such
policy which took into account the country's needs, incentives
to producers and the findings of relevant studies on the
subject (para 1. Side Letter of December 23, 1976).
(ii) Completion of a study of the financial arrangements for, and
availability and distribution of cocoa sector inputs, to be
submitted to IBRD by December 31, 1976 (para 2. Side Letter of
December 23, 1976).
(iii) Design of a comprehensive survey of the cocoa sector by
December 31, 1976 in consultation with IBRD (para 1. Schedule
6. Loan Agreement).
(iv) Appointment of an officer within the Ministry of Cocoa Affairs
to promote and oversee replanting and rehabilitation of
cocoa. Experience and qualifications to be acceptable to IBRD
(para 2. Schedule 6. Loan Agreement).
(v)   Establishment of a seed garden unit by June 30, 1976, headed by
an officer, with experience and qualification acceptable to
IBRD (para 3. Schedule 6. Loan Agreement).
(vi)  Employment of consultants by March 31, 1976 to assist in an
annual review of efficiency and adequacy of seed garden
production (para 3. Schedule 6, and Section 3.02(a), Loan
Agreement).
1/ The Ghana Highway Authority (GHA) was responsible for maintenance of
feeder roads and the feeder road study. PU merely provided inputs
for GHA to do so (see Borrower Comments attached).

III. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Effectiveness and Start-Up
3.01     The project was approved by the Board on December 23 and signed on
December 28, 1975. There was one condition of effectiveness: Agreement was to
be reached between the Bank and the Government of Ghana on the form of the
loan agreement between participant farmers and the Project Unit. There was a
timely resolution in this iss-ie so that it did not affect project
effectiveness in any material way. On February 23, 1976, the project was
de:lared effective.
B. Physical Progress
3.02     Project Execution. At the start of the project Government showed
clearly an intention to embark on a program of rehabilitating the cocoa
industry as efficiently as possible. Even before project effectiveness key
staff were in post at headquarters, in three zonal offices and nine district
offices; a work program was prepared and some vehicles purchased through
fiannving from Government budget and from the Ghana Cocoa larketing Board
gCGNB ). Also, the cocoa sector was given high priority in the allocation of
input licenses and a study was started on the cocoa pricing policy. Dynamic
leadership of project management succeeded in achieving 6,000 acres which was
about 85% of the ambitious first year replanting target of 7,100 acres
(including BADEA program). On September 20, 1976, BADEA's loan for USS5.0
million became effective adding an additional 12,500 acres to the Bank's
replanting target of 30,000 acres. In this first year the major problems
experienced by the project were:
(i)  inappropriate attitude of extension personnel seconded from the
Cocoa Production Division of the MCA, who - in order to meet
their planting targets - explained to farmers that Government
had established the project to do the replanting and subsequent
maintenance for them;
(_i)  inadequate provision of seedlings; and
(iii) low farmer participation.
The first two problems were partially resolved by reassignment of most of the
seconded staff back to the Cocoa Production Division (CPD) of MCA and by
increasing the number of nurseries over a larger area to simplify the
logistics of the transport of seedlings. However, the underlying problem -
inadequate production of seedpods from which the seedlings were to be raised -
was not tackled until late 1977 when, under strong pressure from the Bank,
action was taken towards creation of a semi-autonomous Seed Garden Unit and
the appointment of a qualified head of the unit.
3.03     Cocoa Nurseries.  After having encountered transportation problems
resulting from long transportation distances over often rough roads, the set
up of a few large central nurseries had been changed towards the establishment
of a large number of smaller nurseries closer to the planting areas. However,



at many of the smaller nurseries, water had to be transporj qd during the dry
season. Moreover, too small polythene seedling containers±! - causing coiling
of the tap root - were used and general maintenance of the nurseries was
inadequate. Also, overgrown seedlings were used, planting was extended too
far in'o the dry season, and depleted food crop sites were selected - often
under pressure to meet planting targets. Thus, planting standards were often
poor, necessitating intensive vacancy filling. The amount of vacancy filling
required was high at an average of 30 percent, 15 percent and 5 percent in the
three years following initial planting.
3.04     Low Farmer Participation consistently haunted the project.  The
principal reason for low farmer participation was inadequate producer
prices. This is discussed fully in paras 6.06-6.11. In addtion, farm labor
availability also became an issue (paras 6.16-6.19). Since the start of the
ERCP in 1970 the supply of farm labor has dropped over the years.  It is
believed that the Alien Compliance Order enforced in 1970/71 and which ousted
most alien share croppers (Voltaic) marks the beginning of the decline in
labor availability (para 6.19). Together with the free education, which had
the effect of causing school leavers (hitherto the potentiala family farm
labor) to drift to urban communities in search of a job, and the breakdown of
the country's economy, the shortage of farm labor became increasingly
pronounced over time. With the sagging economy and increasing shortages of
food crops the owner-farmer has to devote more time to food crop production to
the detriment of cocoa for which, moreover, the required production inputs
such as insecticides, seedlings and small equipment became increasingly
difficult to come by. Summarizing the experience with project participants,
project management wrote in its Project Completion Report: 'more than 80
percent of the project beneficiaries refused to do anything on their own
project-aided (cocoa) farms. The 20 percent contribution toward labor cost
was never fulfilled by participants. PU ended up financing 100 percent of
labor cost."
C. Agricultural Achievements
3.05     A comparison of the appraisal and revised targets is shown in
Table 1. As the data show, only 52 percent of the revised target of 42,500
acres had been planted by the end of 1978 (the original project completion
date, or 73 percent of the initial target of 30,000 acres). Ab that time
doubts began to emerge as to the justification of further new planting, as
much cocoa from producing trees in the project area (non-project plantings)
was not being harvested.  At the root of the cocoa sector's problem was the
unattractively low real producer prices in absolute terms and also relative to
food crop prices. There was competition from food farming, cocoa farmer's
population was aging, and hired labor was scarce and expensive.  Moreover,
large numbers of young men from the villages were migrating to Nigeria, in
search for higher wages.  There was thus a real danger that the investment in
previous plantings would be lost for lack of maintenance and the only way to
prevent large scale losses was to continue maintenance. Since 60% of the IBRD
1/  PU (see Borrower Comments attached) disagrees:  "Sizes of polythene
seedling containers were as always used in Ghana and Ivory Coast
and were most satisfactory."



-9-
funds were still undie'brsed, and the world cocoa prices were at an all time
high, it was hoped tha  '-he problems expez-ienced were -emporary and that
within the frameworc of a contemplated IDA cocoa secto: credit, conditions
would improve sufficiently to make cocoa an attractive crop again. Therefore,
the Bank agreed to extend the implementation period from three to seven years
(first to December 1980, them :to ecember 1981 and finelly to December 1982),
which enabled the PU to achieve over 90 percent of the revised target by the
end of the sixth year, i.e. 1981.  In the last year (1982), no new plantings
were undertakeen and the PU concentrated its resources cn maintenance of
planted farms Tnurther discussion of the Bank's considerations in extending
project implementation period in para 7.04).

D.  Project Costs and Financing
3.06     Costs.  A comparison of actual project costs and appraisal estimates
is shown below in Table 2 and detailed in Annex II, Table 1. Actual project
costs amounted to % 149 million (US$65.7 million).  This represents a 490
percent increase in terms of cedis and a 200 percent increase in dollar
terms. This increase was due to the substantial time over-run (4 years) in
project completion, as well as the persistently high inflation which Ghana
experienced during the implementation period.  The high inflation rate was not
offset by exchange rate adjustment. The largest increase was in on-farm costs
followed by staff costs. In both cases, the lion's share of the increase can
be attributed to the massive escalation in labor costs.

3.07     Financing. A comparison of appraisal and actual project financing is
shown in Table 3. The actual percentage of Bank financing was reduced to
between 17 and 30 percent compared to an appraisal estimate of 64 percent,
while the government share increased to 80 percent compared to the appraisal
estimate of 36 percent. Local cost overruns were financed by increases in
Government of Ghana subventions while foreign cost overruns were financed by a
revision of Bank disbursement percentages.

E. Disbursements
3.08     To ensure financing of critical items for the replanting program and
its supervision the project's Loan Agreement 1181-GH stipulates that 100
percent foreign cost of sprayers, insecticides, vehicles and eq: ipment would
be financed out of the Bank loan. With BADEA co-financing on a joint basis,
it was agreed that foreign expenditures for the above items would be shared
between the Bank and BADEA at the ratio 71:29. When in May 1982, the BADEA
loan was almost entirely drawn down, the Bank's disbursement for the above
items went back to 100 percent. Expenditures on seedlings, staff salaries and
loan to farmers were reimbursable on the basis of 90 percent, 40 percent and
90 percent. But when it became apparent that the project period would be
extended over a couple of years to meet planting targets, the disbursement
percentages were decreased to 17, 17 and 30 percent, respectively. A
comparison of actual disbursements and appraisal estimates is shown in Table 4
and a detailed loan disbursement profile is in Annex II, Table 2.

F. Procurement
3.09     The purchase of vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles and spraying machines
followed international competitive bidding procedures, with direct payment to
suppliers; no particular problems were encountered.  Procurement procedures
following BADEA guidelines turned out to be cumbersome and the poor
communications with BADEA's headquarters caused so much delay that the Bank
agreed - on the Borrower's request - to pay suppliers directly and settle
reimbursements with BADEA later. This arrangement worked satisfactorily until
March 1980, when the Bank notified the Borrower that it was unable to continue
this procedure for administrative reasons. Local competitive bidding was far
more difficult, because frequently price quotations changed in a matter of
days due to the scarcity of the items. For hard to find critical items the PU
was often forced to pay exorbitant prices. This was avoided when spare parts
were ordered from a procurement agent in Europe, with direct payment from the
Bank.

G. Credit and Credit Recovery
3.10     Under the project, replanting loans were to be given originally over
a period of three years with farmers contributing about 20% to labor cost.
However, because of the lack of interest of farmers, replanting loans covered
100% of labor cost and material over a period of six years divided into farm
development in the first year and maintenance over the five subsequent
years. According to project management, loans furnished to farmers amount to
some Cedis 25.5 million, of which the first repayments were due in the spring
of 1982. Recovery of credit is the task of the Produce Buying Division of the
GCMB, but because of the confusion resulting from the introduction of the new
cheque system and computer problems, no serious efforts for credit recovery
had been made by spring 1983.
IV. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
A. Yield and Output
4.01     The Appraisal Report assumed that replantings made under the project
would begin to show significant yields in the 4th year after replanting, with
a progressive yield build-up from 100 lbs/acre to 750 lbs/acre dry beans in
the seventh year onward. Production was expected to reach approximately
15,000 long tons of cocoa. However, the experience shows that these forecasts
were too optimistic. A comparison of appraisal targets with estimated
achievements in acreage, yield and production is shown in Table 5. The latter
are estimates based on the results of field surveys carried out by the PU and
Bank supervision missions. Moreover, there have been several reviews of the
series of breeding trials in Ghana which include the Series 11 hybrids now
being distributed to Project farms and one of the more recent (Lockwood, G.:
Reflections on Yields from Hybrid Cocoa Varieties in Ghana, Cocoa Growers'
Bulletin io. 26, 1977) is particularly relevant because of the projected
yields of these hybrids under farmer management. Net Yields (lbs/acre) for
1971-76 from four trials in the Eastern Region, where, generally, climate and
soil conditions are favorable for cocoa, for the two highest yielding hybrids
represented in all trials, hybrids F and H, were:
1972/3      1973/4        1974/5      1975/6
F      H      F      H       F      H      F        H

Apedwa (1956)       829    730    575    795    468    322    705        655
Asikuma (1956)      480    486    354    403    692    598    841    1043

Lockwood estimated that, as a working hypothesis, the yields at maturity from
farmer managed hybrids in Ghana would be in the range of 490-580 lbs/acre.
This estimate is lower than the yield forecast of 750 lbs/acre given in the
Project Appraisal Report, and about the same as used for the ERR calculations
(para 6.20).

4.02     As of December 1981, the total incremental production of cocoa
attributable to the project was about 573 tons or about 41 percent of the
appraisal estimate of approximately 1,400 tons. Factors explaining this
relatively low incremental production are: (i) the late planting in 1976 and
poor rainfall in 1977 which made it necessary to subsequently replant over 30
percent of the farms which were initially replanted in these years; (ii) the
probability that the replanting targets set at appraisal were too ambitious;
only about 52 percent of the appraisal target was achieved by the initial
closing date of the project; and (iii) as emphasized earlier, poor farmer
participation, which, in turn, was a contributory factor in the yields
realized on the respective farms. However, if replanted areas were to be
reasonably well maintained and harvested, full production will be reached in
1993 with some 10,400 tons of dry cocoa beans annually, based on an average
yield of 600 lbs/acre instead of the appraisal estimate of 750 lbs/acre.
Unfortunately, however, because harmattan and bush fires in the project area
in early 1983 destroyed some 11,000 acres or about 30 percent Of the replanted
area, anticipated production may be closer to 7,000 tons.
B. Farm Income
4.03     Table 6 compares farmers' average returns from cocoa production under
three alternative scenario: (i) in years 4-6 when the weighted average
producer price received by project-relat-d farms was 0286 per 30 kg load, (ii)
in year 7 when the producer price was raised to 0360 per load, and (iii) from
year 10 onwards when the yield is expected to reach 10 loads or 600 lbs/acre
compared to the past average of 2 loads per acre. First, during years 4-6
(1978-81), the net value of output per acre on a typical project-related farm
was 0119, and the related return per manday only 06.3. This represented about
78d of the average wage (08.00 per Jay) which was being paid by the PU during
that period. Second, with the raising of the producer price to 0360 per load
in December 1981, and assuming the same rate of labor utilization and
incremental output level, both the net return and its manday equivalent more
than doubled during the 7th year of project implementation.



- 14 -
4.04     Third, based on field surveys and estimates prepared by the PU, it is
estimated that the aveage yield on project-related farms will reach 10 loads
or 600 lbs/acre by year 10, when the acreage replanted during the project is
expected to come into full bearing. However, field surveys carried out by the
PU indicate that, depending on differences in planting success, there may be
marked divergencies in output even among fields planted in the same season.
The reasons for this are the large differences in the quality of the seedlings
and iLj soil fertility (para 3.03) For 3-year old plantings in the project
area, field observations show that an average of 10 percent produced fruit;
comparable figures for 4,5 and 6 year-old plantings were 26 percent, 40
percent and 50 percent, respectively. On this basis, a reasonable assumption
is that during the 7th, 8th, and 9th years, an average of 80 percent, 90
percent and 100 percent of plantings would be bearing respectively.

Net revenue per acre              119       267                2,495
Returns per manday                  6.3      14                  113.4
4.05     Based on this assumption, and others concerning materibl and labor
costs (shown in the table), the net returns per manday are likely to reach at
least 02,495 per acre or 0113 per manday from the 10th year onwards. The
appraisal report indicated that during debt service farmers would increase
their net income by 058 per acre and by 0128 per acre thereafter. Income was
expected to be highest during years 2 and 3 when plaintain production was
expected to peak. However, based on the considerations given above, farmers'
actual incremental net income, both during and after the debt servicing
period, is likely to be considerably higher than the apraisal estimate.
However, this more optimistic forecast is predicated on several interrelated
presuppositions. One is that the producer price will be maintained at some
realistic level in both absolute and relative terms (in the latter case, in
relation to the price of competing crops as well as the world market price of
cocoa). Further, the policy on output pricing should be synergistic with the
overall set of macro and sector policies designed to improve the overall
quality of life in the agricultural and rural sectors.
4.06     Another factor affecting farm income, and which should be taken into
account in the design of future cocoa projects, is the nature of the cropping
pattern. Various field surveys of the Ashanti region indicate that the
typical fara family, on average, operates, between 3 to 5 farms, components of



- 15 -
each type of farm as follows:
Farm I          - Maize/Cassava
Farm II         - Cassava/plantain/cocoyam/vegetables (cassava
predominant)
Farm III        - Plantain3/cassava(cocoyam/yam/vegetables
(plantains   predominant)
Farm IV         - Cash crop: cocoa/other cash
crop/plantain/cocoyam/other cash crop: oil palm,
citrus, cola, avocado, but with cocoa predominant).
Ths experience suggests that the development of these farm typologies is not
effected in one year or season; rather, each typology, with the possible
exception of cash crops, represents a stage in the cropping pattern, with cash
crops like cocoa, oil palm and citrus normally produced on farms which were
initially established for food crop production. No fertilizers are applied to
project farms. Results from several series of trials undertaken by the Cocoa
Research Institute of Ghana have shown that responses to fertilizer
applications by young cocoa are small, inconsistent and uneconomic.
4.07     The frequent occurrence of intercropping of oil palm or cocoa with
cassava, plantain or other food crops, and the seeming neglect of cocoa farms,
may represent part of cocoa farmers' rational choice process. The pattern of
food crop production is based primarily on the need to satisfy household good
requirements and additional income for daily household expenditures on items
like kerosene, soap, matches, salt, etc. On the other hand, cash crops like
cocoa are expected to provide incomes necessary for purchasing consumer
durables - furniture, radios, building materials, etc.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Project Organization and Management
5.01     The project was to be implemented by a semi-autonomous project unit
within MCA. The first group of senior officers comprising the Project Manager
were recruited by the GCMB and assumed duty by June 1975. Management of the
project was on average good, with senior staff alive to problems and actively
seeking solutions. The project manager has proved his competence, drive and
ability to inspire and control staff in a very difficult economic
environment. Many middle level staff Project Officers and Farm Inspection
Officers resigned in 1979 to take up appointments in Nigeria but were replaced
by university graduates on National Service.
5.02     The project area was divided into three zones: Konogo, Bekwai and
Effiduasi. Initially, the zones were headed by Assistant Project Managers,
but these positions were found to be unnecessary and were finally abolished;
in doing so, comkunications between zonal officers and project management
clearly improved. Each zone was made up of units and each unit managed by a
Project Officer and a Farm Inspection Officer. A Project Officer was assisted
by one or two Senior Technical Assistants and several Field Assistants. The
Farm Inspection Officer was assisted by one Senior Field Inspection Assistant
and several Farm Inspection Assistants. The project started with 63 nurseries
(1975/76), had at its height 1272 nurseries (1978/79), and reduced this to 844



_ 16 -
in 1980/81. Nurseries were the responsibility of Field Assistants, each of
whom managed the number of nurseries necessary to supply field plantings in
his working area. This organization set-up was the most appropriate under the
given circumstances. However, due to the dispersed location of the project
farms a proper supervision on planting and maintenance activities was
impossible and consequently top production of project farms may take a longer
period than owner managed farms.
B. Training
5.03     Farmers' Training were held throughout the project period at village
level. Starting with 55 village level meetings in 1975/76, an average of
approximately 200 meetings per year were organized with an attendance of 15-20
persons per meeting. Subjects centered on technical aspects of good crop
husbandry and the need to continue maintenance after the project period; the
reRults as to the usefulness of these meetings are mixed. Also junior
technical staff and middle management personnel were trained and five senior
staff went on a six-week management training course in Managa, Swaziland. A
senior credit officer was sponsored by the USAID for a four-month course in
Credit Administration at the Ohio State University, USA. It is doubtful,
whether training of middle level staff has been beneficial to the project
since project management estimate that about 50 percent of the trainees left
the project for better paying jobs abroad almost immediately after the
training.  About 10 percent is estimated to have left the project for other
appointments in Ghana or for continued training abroad.
VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Macroeconomic Constraints on Project Implementation
6.01     The project was implemented during a period (1976-1982) in which
Ghana was experiencing acute difficulties at the political, macroeconomic and
sector levels. During this period, GNP per capita fell by an annual average
rate of at least 4 percent per annum. This was accompanied by persistently
high rates of inflation (1977: 116%; 1978: 735; 1979: 541: 1980: 50%; 1981:
1161 and 1982: 30%), and balance of payments difficulties traceable to a
decline in cocoa and timber exports as well as rising imports of petroleum and
food items. The increasing scarcity of foreign exchange has resulted not only
in shortages in imported inputs including insecticides and spare parts, but
also in an increasing lack of wage goods needed 'iy farmers. These and related
macroeconomic developments not only posed serious constraints to project
implementation, but were also contributory factors to the overall decline in
the agricultural sector.
6.02     The high inflation rate, particularly after 1977, not only led to a
denudation of confidence in the local paper currency, but was also a factor in
increased labor costs, and consequently, an escalatio': of project costs.
While the inflation in Ghana, as in the case of other open economies, reflects
a combination of cost-push, demand-push, and structural elements, one overall
effect has been the escalation in wage costs due to the escalation in minimum
wages. As the data in Table 7 show, the minimum wages paid to laborers in the
project increased more than sixfold between 1975/76 and 1981/82.  Moreover,



- 17 -
this was also accompanied by a substantial increase in the total number of
laborers employed by the project (para 7.03).

6.03     During the past few years, local food prices rose substantially, with
rural consumer price index rising much more rapidly than the urban consumer
price index. Inherent in this trend was a relative rise in the price of
locally produced food vis-a-vis the price of cocoa. In the latter case, this
meant that rehabilitation efforts were progressively affected by the more
favorable domestic food-cocoa net barter terms of trade, and in particular,
the failure of real cocoa producer prices to sufficiently align themselves
with competing food crops. These and other factors of significance are
analyzed in greater detail below.
6.04     As was the case with the earlier ERCP, a major factor which inhibited
the entire implementation process was poor farmer participation. Daring
implementation, systematic surveys and investigations carried out by the PU
revealed that about 10 percent of the farmer participants were often not
residing at the addresses given during registration,and that for the majority
cocoa farming was at best a secondary occupation. The remaining 90 percent
did practically no work on their project-aided farms, with practically all
operations, including the organization of the labor supply, carried out by PU
staff. In this context, the PU surveys revealed that active farmer
participation (defined in terms of the percentage of farmers who worked
directly on their farms or organized labor to perform specific agricultural
tasks) in the development of new farms never exceeded 18 percent (achieved in
1981), while active participation in maintenance and replanting never exceeded
6 percent in any one year during the entire life of the project. On an
overall basis, it can be concluded that low levels of motivation were
prevalent among 85 percent or more of farmer participants.
6.05     Several explanations have been offered for the increasing lack of
farmer motivation, and therefore their poor participation rates. A consensus
has emerged that one of the principal factors is the sharp decline in the real
producer price (i.e. the nominal producer price deflated by the consumer price
index) of cocoa since the early 1960s. Further, the declining trend in real
producer prices has been accompanied by a sluggish behavior of these prices in
relation to the prices of competing food crops - mainly maize, plantain, yam,



- 18 -
cocoyam, and oil palm. Returns to producing cocoa are now well below those of
these competing crops. As a result, many cocoa farmers have switched to
subsistence farming, with food replacing cocoa as the major cash crop, at
least in the short run.
B. Reel Producer Prices of Cocoa
6.06     As the data in Annex III, Table 1 show, nominal cocoa producer prices
have increased several times since the inception of the Ashanti Cocoa
Project. Further, the nominal producer price tripled during the 1982/83
season from 04000 to 012,000 per metric ton. However, in real terms, it still
remains about one half the level prevailing in the early 1970s. Thus, in one
sense, it can be argued that it is not that nominal producer prices are low,
but that the rapid rate of inflation has eroded confidence in money, and has
tended to wipe out any real gains emanating from successive increases in
nominal producer prices.
6.07     The pricing issue has received in-depth treatment in several previous
Bank reports 1/, including the Appraisal Report of the ARCP. Understanding of
the problems involved requires that the iesue be looked at from the
perspective of past and present output pricing policy. Since its
establishment in 1947, the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board (GCMB) was charged with
the responsibility of reviewing cocoa prices, and with the stabilisation of
prices, and therefore cocoa farmers' incomes. During the earlier phases of
its operations, prices were not revised on an annual basis, and, as indicated
earlier, despite large nominal increases in the recent past, real producer
prices were only a fraction of what they were in the 1950s to the 1970s. The
past experience also revealed substantial divergences between international
price movements and the domestic producer price, between the domestic prices
and comparative prices paid in other cocoa producing countries, as well as
increases in the absolute level of taxation of the cocoa sector. These
comparative trends are shown in Annex III, Tables 2 and 3.
6.08 However, there has been a marked reversal in the situation during the
past two years, with successively large increases in the nominal producer
price. This was a result of persistent Bank pressure, and was in line with an
agreement reached during negotiation of the ARCP-that a rational and informed
pricing policy should be developed. As a consequence, the average producer
price per tonne of cocoa was raised to 12,000 cedis in 1981/82. This was far
above the average f.o.b. price of 5,000 cedis (Annex III Table 4). The price
increase in 1981/82 without an exchange rate adjustment resulted in a negative
yield in the cocoa export duty, and raised questions about government's
ability to finance price levels beyond a certain point without realigning its
national currency.
6.09     Estimates provided by the GCWB showed that at a 200,000 tonnes
production level, every ¢10 increase in the price per load (30 kg) required

financing of about 067 million. With a further increase of producer price to
020.000 per tonne, the cost of purchasing 200,000 tonnes would have amounted
to 04 billion.  This amount, added to a projected deficit of 0!,  billion for
the 1981/82 fisc&l year, could not only have spelled budgetary disa -. -r, but
to the extent that it was to be financed by increasing bank borr-wing, it
would have added fuel to the already high levels of inflation, and help to
nullify the real income effect of an increase in producer prices. However,
with the exchange rate adjustment in 1983, the cocoa producer prices were
raised to 20,000 cedis per tonne without budgetary problems.
6.10     Besides the issue of government finance, a perennial concern has been
with the level of producer prices that would provide incentives for short-term
rehabilitation, and encourage new plantings and replantings over the longer
run. First, it has been argued that the decline in cocoa production ia recent
years can be attributed to factors other than price, with producer prices
having only a marginal or even negligible effect on output.  For examplt  at
the time of Ghana's highest recorded crop (the 1964/65 season), ;.he real price
of cocoa stood at around 18 percent of its value at the turn of the century,
while prices in real terms had fallen steadily over the previous decade. At
the level of empirical analysis, the specification of a supply function
(measuring the supply response) for _ocoa is an extremely complex matter.
Large fluctuations in annual output can result from the effects of other
variables (e.g. weather) which are difficult to quantity. However, a recent
econometric study 1/ has shown that Ghanaian cocoa production is influenced
mainly by real producer prices.  The statistical analysis also implies that
large supplies of insecticides are not effective in increasing production if
price incentives are absent. There are also arguments about the relative
merits of replanting vis-a- vis rehabilitation. In the latter case it is now
considered that interesting production increases can be attained almost
immediately through rehabilitation of existing cocoa plantations.
6.11     As indicated earlier, there is a groving concern over the increased
influence on cocoa production levels of food crop prices. The evidence
suggests (Annex IV Table 1) that even with substantial increases in cocoa
producer prices, they still remair. well below those of competing food crops.
Vith historically high domestic in flation levels, the attractiveness of food
cropping has increased considerablz7. It could be argued that in the past
cocoa output was subject to a high degree of inertia. With a limited number
of profitable alternative activities, cocoa farmers tended to react slowly to
falling real prices. However, the situation has changed drastically. Farmers
and caretakers are now fully aware of the opportunity costs of labor and other
resources which have to be devoted to cocoa production. These and some other
factors affecting food crop-cocoa production possibilities are highlighted in
Table 8 below. The data relate to 1982. With the 1983 increase in cocoa
producer price to 20,000 cedis per tonne, the absolute profitability of cocoa
production has increased considerably but is still unfavorable relative to
some foodcrops and oil palm.

C. Food Crop/Cocoa Substitution
6.12     In the first place, the analysis of the relevant crop budgets (Table
8) reveals the unprofitable nature of cocoa production. The returns to cocoa
for the improved method of cocoa production in the Ashanti region was *only
slightly above the minimum wage of 014 per day in 1982. Further, this return
to labor was only about a half of the farm labor market wage. The net returns
per acre on cocoa production were only a very small fraction of the net
returns on competing crops. This situation adversely affected the
establishment of new cocoa farms. The opportunity cost of producing cocoa has
become so high that a large number of farmers now find it increasingly
profitable to replace their cocoa farms with oil palm, citrus, or food crops.
6.13     A factor of some significance is the growing importance of Akpeteshie
gin production in the Ashanti region.  A large number of cocoa farms boast a
considerable population of wild palm stands, and labor which is supposed to be
actively involved in cocoa production, is actively engaged in palm wine
tapping and gin production. The evident justification is provided by the
relatively high income received from gin production. The return to labor in
this activity (0205 per manday) was approximately fifteen times the minimun
wage and about six times the farm labor market wage of 035.00 in 1982.
However, palm trees tapped for wine are destroyed and, therefore, this one-
time activity is not strictly comparable to the perennial nature of cocoa and
oil palm production.
6.14     A second set of factors relate to the considerations which influence
the farm investment decision. The data below show the types of physical
assets which are required for the production of food crops vis-a-vis major
cash crops like cocoa. Their availability tends to influence the farmer's
initial decision making, considering the scarcity of liquid capital including
credit opportunities, with the farmer's decision to engage in one type of
production activity rather than another depending, inter alia, on the
magnitude of initial and subsequent investment involved. A point of emphasis

is that investment in efficient cocoa production requires all of the types of
assets indicated above, while investments in the other crops do not. This
factor, combined with others such as the high rate of inflation, the relative
scarcity of farm labor and other inputs, as well as high food prices, has a
significant impact on the decision to investment in cocoa vis-a-vis food
crops. Other factors include: (a) the relatively long gestation of cocoa
production in relation to the evidently short time preference of investment in
a highly inflationary economy, and (b), as indicated above, the return to
labor which in turn depends on the availability of other variable inputs, the
relative prices of these inputs, and the competitive prices of agricultural
outputs.
6.15     Another factor which has militated against the attractiveness of
cocoa production is the nature of the land tenure system.  There are two basic
categories of land tenure arrangements in the Ashanti region: (a) a short
lease - normally lasting between one cropping season and two years, and (b) a
long lease lasting for a period of 50 years or more. The short lease tenurial
arrangement permits the production of annual or biennial crops such as maize,
cassava, plantaia, and vegetables. It is usually a simple arrangement
involving the head of a family that owns and works the land and the
prospective tenant farmer, with rent payment taking a variety of forms -
freehold (no rent payment), liquor and money, crop sharing, and/or working
part-time for the landowner. The cultivation of permanent cash crops like
cocoa requires a long-lease type of tenurial arrangement. Not only is this
arrangement restricted in the Ashanti region, but in general involves a
lengthy process of negotiation with the traditional and governmental
bureaucracy. In the Ashanti region, farmers cultivating permanent crops often
do so on family holdings which they occupy on a freehold basis.



- 22 -
D. Labor Availability
6.16     Project implementation was affected on a continuous basis by the
unavailability of farm labor. The relative scarcity of labor in the Ashanti
region was given due recognition in the Appraisal Report. The evidence
suggests that the labor supply was adequate up to around 1977. However, most
of this labor was confined to villages which were larger in size than the
normal farming village, and which served as semi-commercial centers for the
neighboring farming communities. However, between 1978 and 1982, there has
been a considerable outmigration of this labor from the semi-commercial
villages to urban centers and to countries such as Nigeria. Surveys by the PU
indicate that some labor is still available in these villages, but problems of
location prevent the availability for hiring. Problems have been encountered
in moving the labor to the farming localities, as well as motivating the
individuals concerned to stay in these localities. Frequently cited causal
factors include the lack of suitable accommodation, especially rental units,
as well as the unavailability of commercially prepared meals.
6.17     The above mentioned labor problems are of particular significance in
the case of two types of labor - casual labor which is paid on a daily basis,
and permanent labor which is paid on a monthly basis. Smallholder foodcrop
farmers have traditionally utilized casual labor for on-farm operations such
as land preparation and weeding, while large scale private farms and public
agricultural institutions tend to utilize permanent labor.
6.18     However, another important type of labor in the cocoa industry is
provided through the institution of sharecropping. Traditionally, the share
cropping arrangements were based on the ABUSA (one-third) system of
distributing crop proceeds, with one-third of the crop going to the
sharecropper, and two-thirds to the cocoa farm owner. This practice has
virtually ended for several reasons. One factor, previously mentioned, is
that farmers and caretakers have become increasingly aware of the opportunity
cost of labor. Partial evidence of this is the demand now being made by
sharecroppers in the Ashanti region for sharecropping arrangements on new
farms to be based on the ABUNU (one half) system rather than on the
traditional one-third system of distribution. Interviews with cocoa farmers
indicate that even the 50-50 arrangement is no longer appealing to
sharecroppers. The arrangement seems to have become increasingly unattractive
on account of the relatively hard work which cocoa production requires, as
well as the declining state of cocoa farms.
6.19     In historical perspective, the majority of sharecroppers originated
from Upper Volta, Mali and Niger. Most of these were expelled under the 1971
Aliens Compliance Order which restr_cted employment to persons with valid
resident permits. The few who remained left the country as the economy
continued to deteriorate, and as the opportunity cost of cocoa farm labor
appeared to be considerably higher in other West African countries - notably
Nigeria and the Ivory Coast. In addition, the recent forced return of many
potential laborers from Nigeria does not seem to have any noticeable impact on
the problem of labor shortage.

E.  The Project Economic Rate of Return
6.20     The economic rate of return for the project has been recomputed on
the basis of the assumptions outlined below ana tta data provided in Annex III
Table 4.  The main assumptions used in the economic analysis arc as follows:
(i)    the life of the project is assumed to be 30 year , beginning with
Project Year 1, as at appraisal.
(ii)    the yield build-up for cocoa is as follows:
Yrs        3     4     5     6      7     8     9-40
lbs/acre   18    67   144   280   360   500      600
(see paras 4.01 and 4.04.)
(iii)    as at appraisal, full on-farm costs have been included for sprayers
and insecticides at unsubsidized prices; a shadow wage rate equal to
the market wage rate is used in the economic valuation of labor;
(iv)    in contrast to the appraisal report, the cost of feeder road
improvement is assumed to be offset by road user savings;
gv)    all project administration costs have been included inti. 1982/83;
thereafter, a declining proportion of costs has beer. included to
reflect the decrease in maintenance requirements of project farms
when plant canopy is closed; and
(vi)    the foreign exchange rate has been shadow priced.
6.21     Based on the above assumptions, the economic rate of return is 13%,
taking into account the fact that 30% of the new plantings were destroyed by
the 1983 fires. The ERR at completion is much lower than the 21% at appraisal
principally because of lower projected yields from replanting compared to
appraisal estimates and the escalation in costs resulting from the extended
implementation period of 7 years compared to 3 years estimated at appraisal.
6.22     While the re-estimated ERR of 13% is based on the assumption that,
with improving economic environment, particularly a regular and adequate
adjustment of cocoa producer prices (see para 8.03 for the basis of this
assumption), farmers will be induced to return to their cocoa farms and start
proper maintenance and harvesting resulting in a yield of 600 lbs./acre at
full development, an alternative scenario was also considered. In this
scenario, farmers might continue to be disinterested and the project staff
would continue to maintain and harvest the project planted farms. There would
be considerably lower efficiency in this scenario resulting in a projected
average yield of 300 lbs./acre at full development. The ERR in this scenario
would drop to 5%.  Since it is extremely difficult to predict the developments
in the cocoa sector, the ERR could conceivably range from 5% to 13%. However,
considering the efforts currently underway for sectoral rehabilitation (para
8.03), the upper ranges of the ERR are regarded as more likely.

VII. PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK AND THE BORROWER
A. Performance of the Bank
7.01     During preparation of the project (in which the Bank assisted)
serious consideration had been given to the experiences obtained in the
execution of the ERCP, i.e. waning farmer interest and lack of hired farm
labor. To avoid similar problems the Bank recommended to substantially
increase the potential area from which the replanted area would be chosen, to
restrict credit to resident farmers only, for an area of no more than 5 acres
per family per year, and finally, to increase the producer price of cocoa to
bring alive farmers' interest in cocoa growing.  Though it was recognized that
the large project area would make the distribution of seedlings and adequate
supervision very costly, it was assumed that project management would
appropriately cope with it.
7.02     Though the Bank showed awareness of the problems encountered under
the preceding ERCP, as evidenced by the discussions in the Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR) of ARCP, it is questionnable whether the Bank had the full grasp
of the complications in the cocoa sector in Ghana. The ARCP turned out to be
an almost exact replica of ERCP with precisely similar problems. Firstly,
though the SAR indicated that the project area would be ten times that of ERCP
and only 7% would be replanted (30,000 acres), the project area obviously
included good and fair cocoa which could not be replanted. The Intensive
Cocoa Survey by MCA (para 2.05) indicated that only 122,000 acres of cocoa
were poor or dying which could be replanted. The actual proportion of area to
be replanted by the project (42,500 acres including the BADEA program) to the
potential replanting area (122,000) was thus 35% and not 7% as assumed at
appraisal. This level of farmer response on an acreage basis in three years
as envisaged at appraisal was an unrealistic expectation. Secondly, even in
absolute ter-,. the replanting target of 30,000 acres in three years appears
ambitio':a given the fact that it was not a plantation project but rather
replanting on scattered farms in a relatively large project area and problems
of low farmer participation were already well known under ERCP.
7.03     Most important, while the ARCP was formulated with a much better
awareness of the cocoa producer price issue and the SAR clearly stated that
"the present price.... is clearly inadequate, even under the most favorable
conditions, to provide a satisfactory return to labor employed in cocoa
cultivation and to induce farmers to replant and maintain their cocoa farms
sazisfactorily ........  The price must be increased .*..o", the loan was
neither made conditional on adequate price increases nor any mechanism was
introduced to ensure regular and adequate adjustment of cocoa producer
prices.  Instead, the Government was only required to formulate for discussion
with IBRD by December 31, 1976 a producer price policy that took account of
the country's needs and the findings of relevant studies. This paper was
never produced. The subject of producer prices was repeatedly brought up by
Bank supervision missions during the project implementation period. The
producer prices were increased by the Government several times in nominal
terms but they were always too little and too late. The Bank could,
therefore, be criticized, firstly, for having gone ahead with the project
despite the experience under the ongoing ERCP and, secondly, for having
underestimated the complexities of resolving major sectoral issues, such as



- 25 -
po -4ucer prices, whfih have also macro-economic i=p1i^atrons (also see para
8.02).
7.04     A judgement on the desirability of extending the project
implementatio' period from 3 to 7 years is more difficult to make. While the
project staff is at present saddled with the problem of maintaining and
harvesting a relatively large acreage of 38,000 acres on behalf of the farmers
and a smaller acreage (if the project had been closed in 1978) would have
facilitated better maintenance, it should be noted that the problem of low
farmer participation was always recognized as a transitory one awaiting
resolution of the producer price issue and efforts continued to be made by the
Bank to resolve this issue. Under the circumstances, stopping replantings in
1978, considerably short of the appraisal target, was not considered a
desirable action. It should be noted that the cocoa variety planted on
project farms can withstand years of neglect without dying or substantially
decreasing its production potential once it is rehabilitated. In this sense,
the investments made on the project planted farms are not entirely lost.
Moreover, while the explicit reasons for extending project completion date
were varied (see para 7.06), an important consideration before the Bank was
continued presence in the most important sector in Ghana (after ERCP closed in
1979) and to endeavor to use the project as a leverage for resolving major
sector issues such as producer prices, complementing the on-going IMF-Bank
dialogue with the Government for implementation of major macro-economic
reforms, principally exchange rate adjustment. The continuation of the
project was also beneficial to the later Ghana Cocoa Sector Study (1980)
undertaken by the Bank, Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board study by consultants
(1980) and Cocoa III Prefeasibility Studies by a team of consultants (1981),
the last two studies having been financed under ARCP. These studies were the
only comprehensive reviews of the cocoa sector in more than a decade and
provided valuable information and analysis for the future development strategy
for the sector.
7.05     On the technical aspects of the project, Bank supervision missions
worked effectively with project management to solve or prevent problems
through consultant advice on the production and distribution of seedlings and
special provisions to import material and spare parts expediently through the
use of a procurement agent in Europe. On the whole, the Bank did whatever was
required to make the project a success, or at least to limit the losses to the
minimum.
B. Performance of the Borrower
7.06     In spite of an encouraging start, a waning Government interest in the
cocoa industry became gradually apparent. Of the six assurances of the Loan,
which the Government gave during negotations in October 1975 (para 2.11), none
had been realized by early 1977, in violation of the ultimate deadline of
December 31, 1976. It was only by mid-1978, close to the end of the original
closing date of December 1, 1978 that a Banic supervision mission could report
that "satisfactory action had been undertaken by the Government on most of the
loan assurances". Mieanwhile, in November 1977, and again in June 1978, the
Ghana Government requested an extension of the implementation period on the
ground that replanting targets were not being reached due to poor farmer
participation, labor unavailability, and unfavorable weather conditions. The



- 26 -
project completion date was then extended to December 1980. Another request
for extension was made in November 1979. The reasons given at this time were:
the acute fuel problem, the unavailability of polyrolls for raising seedlings
in nurseries, the lack of intensive maintenance of previous replantings, and,
once again, poor farmer participation. The Project closing date was extended
to December 1981, and subsequently to December 1982. By the final closing of
December 1982, however, the Eastern Region Project Records were still not
updated as required under Loan Agreement 1181-GH, Section 3.04 (c) and road
maintenance remained unsatisfactory. The major sector issues of producer
pricing and reorganization of Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board had also not been
resolved. On an overall basis, the project developed in a manner different
from that envisaged at the time of appraisal. Instead of being a vehicle to
rekindle farmer interest, project management was forced to act as a contractor
to carry out activities that the farmers were supposed to do. The end result
was that project personnel grew from a projected 558 to nearly 6,000 persons
by mid-19B1. However, the cost overrun was financed by the Government.
Funding by the Government was also usually timely and adequate.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     An overall assessment of the project is somewhat difficult to make.
Strictly speaking, since the project objective was to "assist" cocoa farmers
in replanting but in reality the project staff carried out the replanting
program and the maintenance of the replanted area without significant farmer
participation, the project was a failure. It would be so in economic terms
also if the present situation continues (ERR of 5TO. However, if the present
sectoral rehabilitation efforts (para 8.03) bear fruit, as they are expected
to, and farmers resume proper maintenance and harvesting, the overall benefits
to the economy would be positive (para 6.22). It should be pointed out that
the economic benefits of the project would have been much more attractive
(even in the worst scenario of non-participation of farmers and
maintenance/harvesting by project staff) had the harmattan and bush fires of
early 1983 not destroyed almost 30% of the project planted acreage.
8.02     As with the preceding ERCP, the principal lessons that emerge from
the experience of ARCP are that it is almost impossible to ensure successful
project implementation when major sector issues (in this case, cocoa producer
prices and inefficient marketing institutions), which have a direct bearing on
project success, remain unresolved and that small, geographically - confined
projects are usually ineffective vehicles for addressing and resolving major
sector issues. The major sector issue of inadequate producer prices was, in
the case of Ghana, linked with macro-economic issues of exchange rate
adjustment and budgetary imbalances (para 6.09) and, therefore, more
complicated. Under both ERCP and ARCP, the Bank could be criticized for
having underestimated the significance of sector issues and for the inability
to devise proper mechanisms for addressing sector issues (para 7.03).
8.03     Cocoa continues to be the most important sector in Ghana's economy.
Past studies have shown that Ghana has a comparative advantage in cocoa
relative to other crops. Despite the unfavorable experience under ERCP and
ARCP, therefore, there is a need to continue efforts to arrest and reverse the
decline of the cocoa industry as one of the essential elements of Ghana's

economic recovery. This is possible if proper pricing policies are followed,
inputs provided, efficient marketing and extension systems ensured and a
coherent long term production strategy followed. Learning from the experience
under ERCP and ARCP, the Bank's modified strategy, as reflected in the
recently approved Export Rehabilitation Project (which inclades cocoa, timber
and gold mining components), is to deal with the issues in the cocoa sector on
a broad-based, sectoral level; link it with macro-economic measures; and
attempt to implement a comprehensive reform package. The approval of the
Export Rehabilitation Project (ERP) was made conditional on major macro-
economic refornis. These reforms were implemented by the Government in 1983,
principally including a substantial exchange rate adjustment and increase in
cccoa producer price from 012,000 to 020,000 per tonne. The ERP includes a
mechanism for regular adjustment of cocoa producer prices (as well as input
prices) through establishment of a Cocoa Producer Price Review Committee and
annual adjustment of producer and input prices in consultation with the Bank
Group. In addition, the ERP envisages institutional reform through
restructuring and reorganization of Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board and Cocoa
Services Division (responsible for extension and input supply) linked to the
provision of insecticides, sprayers, vehicles, workshop facilities, produce
and input storage facilities and spare parts for sectoral rehabilitation.
While the success and effectiveness of this broad-based, sectoral
rehabilitation program remain to be assessed in future, the direction appears
to be appropriate in the light of experiences under ERCP and ARCP.

NOTE
These comments were received after printing of the PCR
but are included as additional information. Many of the
comments (marked "***") had already been made by the
Ashanti Cocoa Project Unit (Attachment, pages 1 and 2) and
are therefore reflected in the PCR. The other comments are
of interest also, especially the final comments of ISSER in
relation to para. 6.22 of the PCR. This point of view should
be taken into account. However, at the same tine, it must
also be pointed out that the project extends over a very
long period and it is difficult (and somewhat subjective)
to judge farmers' future responses against the background
of continuing changes in the macro-economic environment.

The report is a good one and covers adequately all the
important frWts about the life of the project. However, there
are a few points that need to be given greater emphasis than.
they appear in the report,
Inatitational Sa21ort: Since the on set of the BRCP the entire
cocoa industry has suffered from leak institutional support.
The era of both ZRP and ATCP experienced a period of ineffective
extension services, where the extension staff and system could
have been efficient they were not properly motivated and supported
to offer effective and meaningful services to farmers.
The overall management and policies of the industry
concentrated attention and effort on purchases and sales of cocoa,
leamving production to take care of itself. The peasant cOcoa
farmers did not have on organised front to f4lkt for their farming
interests, so it should have been the responsibility of the
Ministry of Cocoa Affairs and more effectively the GIMB, to have
promoted on-farm production.
Trginina  A slight note must be recordid of the fact that the
field staff selected for the project did not receive adeouate
initial trainina before they were given asslgnments. Most of the
staff received what can be described an briefiing and not training.
Adequate initial training would have preuated the Oinappropriate
attitude of extension personell" See 11IB(i) (page 7).
labour: Another minor note that needs redording is that there
were three main sources of labour in the cocoa growing areas
from (i) neighbouring countries,
(ii) the Northern and Upper Regions of Ghana and
(iii) local sources,2hat happened to the labour from the
northern part of Ghana was that Just before the beginning
of ARCP, food (mainly grain crops) prodaction had
become so lucrative in that part of the country tVat this
../2

Page 5
labour decided to stay and take advantage of the situatlon,
rathar than come down south to work on cocoa famld. Thus
the cocoa areas lost a large part of the labour from the
northern sector of Ghana.
***Pare iv, ixararaph 3

se. Pauline Colman,
World Bank Mission in Ghana,
Acora,
sear Madam,
A!IICOCOA P=ENC3PIPO
I thank you for your letters of April 5 3nd April
26, giving me copies of the above report ror y cormmnts.
I have read the report and find it goneraIly
satisfactory and usefal. First I wll point out se,
diroot errore before raising ane substantive issue,
No"  Fara. 2.05      1. On page 4 para 2.05, Eastern Region should be
-  ls              rev Ashni  Region.
'lstn Amhunti        -
**   lOn page 22 para 6.18, A!h  should be AMUN=
3. On page 22 para 6.19, the Aliens were expelled
in 1969 and not in 1971.
The substantive point relates to the fammeru' conoeption
of the projeot ilbich affected their participation. In sm, the
famer  are conidering themselves only' a landlordsm. It In
canceded in para 4.07 that cash crxp like cocoa are expected
to provide incmen necessary for purchaing%onsumer durables -
furniture, radios, bUilding material. etc." Beyond that cocoa
fanms have previously been regarded as valuable ssests and
Ashanti farners especially could boast of their wealth by
pointing to the acreage of cocoa farms* This views am a reult
of all the problems with cocoa indkstry, is no longer valid.
The farmer would now turn to other tree crops such as pala
oil to invest his wealth. The farmer, as the report adhit., also
plants seve*al crops; anid an initial sociological *urw y should
have indicated the farmers' preferences between these crops. On
the bIais of the fact that the framer did not directly receive any
cash payments and also refased to pay the 20 per cent labour
charges, one is compelled to conclude that the farmer thinks that
it is the Government which is interested in increasing cocoa output,
and that he had given his farn to the Government for that exercise.
In this vein, the f amer thinks that the emu lies on the Government
to harvest and pay him his share of the proceeds, as is the practice
under abunu or .%busa. If this view is accepted, then with the



- 46 -                     ATT
Page 8
shortage of labour it is not very likely that the foners mill
undertake the harvesting. I therefore do not agree with the
conclusion of para 6.22. Indeecl the continuation of the project
should be based on th.e assumtion that the project staff mifl have
to contine with fa3r maintenace, rehabilitation and harvesting.
Yours sincerely
Director.
