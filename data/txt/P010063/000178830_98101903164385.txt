INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT
TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF PAKISTAN PROJECT
January 29, 1970



INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMNEIDATION OF THE PRESIDEIUT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRGCTOPS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTA.N FOR THIE
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPHENT BANK OF PAKISTAN PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $20 million
to tne Islamic Republic of Pakistan to help finance the foreign exchange
requiremients of the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP).
PART I - HISTORITCAL
2.       IDEP was established by Ordinance in 1961 primarily to finance
medium and small scale industries in both East and West Pakistan. Its
activi-ties complement those of Pakistan Industrial Credit and Invest-
ment Corporation Ltd (PICIC) which finances medium and large scale
enterprises. PICIC has received eight loans from the Bank in a total
amount (net of cancellations) of US $183.h million equivalent.
3.       The proposed credit would be the first Bank Group lending for
IDBP. In 1964, the company was appraised by the Bank with a view to a
loan. Two obstacles, however, prevented the loan being made. One was
the weakness of IDBP's procedures and capital structure, and the other,
the Bank's policy at that time not to lend to government-owned or con-
trolled development banks. IDBP's procedures and capital structure
have improved considerably since 19614 and it has operated with a fair
degree of autonomy from the Government. When, in 1568, the Bank revised
its policy about lending to government-owned or controlled development
banks, the way was open for the Bank to consider a fresh application
for a loan to IDEP.
4.       IDBP was again appraised by a mission which visited Pakistan
in September 1969. The mission's report was supplemented by the find-
ings (discussed below in Part V) of the Industrial Policy Mission (led
by Mr. Dragoslav Avramovic), which undertook a review of Pakistan's
industrial sector. Negotiations were held in Washington on January 5-9,
1970.  IDB? and the Government of Pakistan were represented by Mr. Zahirul
Huq, the Managing Director of IDBP, Mr. A.R. Bashir, Economic Minister
at the Embassy of Pakistan and Mr. S.A. Qureshi, Chief Officer of Foreign
Exchange Department of IDBP.



5.       The Association has made twenty-eight develonment credits to
Pakistan totalling US $379.2 million, net of cancellations, of which
eight are fully disbursed. The Bank has made thirty loans in Pakistan
for an aggregate amount, net of cancellations, of US $61h.3 million;
eighteen are fully disbur-sed. The following is a summary statement of
IDA credits and Bank loans as at December 31, 1969:

6.        In my various reports (for example in P-727 dated June 12,
1969 circulated to the Executive Directors as R 69-135), I have referred
to the slow rate of disbursement of some of the Association's credits
to Pakistan. Slow disbursements have been caused by a variety of diffi-
culties, especially administrative shortcomings in the executing agencies,
delayed availability or lack of local funds, and poor response to tender-
ing. The following projects give cause for concern. The Khairpur
Ground W'ater and Salinity Control Project (Credit No. 22 PAK) has been
seriously delayed by unsatisfactory performance of the contractors and



- 4 -
iniadequate supervision by the project authority;  hcwever, construction
is now virtually complete and more than half of the project is in oper-
ation. The Dacca and Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Projects
(Credits Nos. 1l and 42 PAK) were revised a little over a year ago
(IDA/R 68-53) and substantial portions of the credits were cancelled;
construction of both projects started very slowly, primarily due to
inadequate rupee funds, but is expected to progress reasonably well
in the Thture and disoursements should accelerate during the current
calendar year; serious financial and managerial problems continue to
exist, but the Association is attempting, through particularly frequent
supervision missions, to improve performance. The East and WVest Pakistan
Education Projects (Credits Nos. L9, 50 and 87 PAK) have all been con-
siderably delayed, primarily due to lack of rupee funds; the next super-
vision mission, which is scheduled for early March will check the progress
made on these projects. On the East Pakistan Highways Project (Credit
No. 53 PAK), there has been repeated failure to secure acceptable tenders;
recomimendations for the revision of the project are being prepared for
t'he consideration of the Executive Directors.
7.        A few other projects encountered problems in their early
stages, but, are now progressing satisfactorily (e.g., the Karachi Port
Development Project - Loan No. 376 PAK, the West Pakistan Highway Pro-
ject - C:Aedit No. 54 PAK, and the Karachi Electric Supply Project -
Loan No. 458 PAK). The Indus Basin and Tarbela Multipurpose Loans
(Nos. 266 and 548 PAK) are being disbursed in accordance with pre-
determined formulae.
8.        IFC has made eleven commitments in Pakistan totalling about
US $21.6 mIllion, net of cancellations, which include anl investmenit of
about US $6.2 million in Karnaphuli Paper laills Ltd. iwhich the sponsors
have decided not to implement. The outstanding commitment, net of repay-
ments, cancellations and sales of loans, is about US $16.5 million. IFC
is prdesently considering applications for investments in the largest
engineering company in Pakistan and in a project for fertilizer production.
9.        Several projects which are expected to be presented for the
approval of the Executive Directors during the remainder of the current
fiscal year are in various stages of preparation.   An engineering credit
for the Karaclhi Port Trust is being negotiated. Presentation of this
credit proposal to the Executive Directors wzill be deferred for a few
weeks until consultants' proposals have been received. Proposals regard-
ing the Chandpur Irrigation and Flood Control Project (US $13 million),
Tubewells in East Pakistan (about US $10 million), Small Industries in
East Pakistan (US $3 million), Telecommunications (US $15 million), and
for Power Transmission and Distr bution (US $20 million) and Technical
Education (US $5 min ion), both in West Pakistan, have been appraised
and are expected to be ready for presentation during the nest few months.
A Mission appraising the second Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drain-
age Project (US $5 million) is presently in the field, while other missions
to appraise the Third West Pakistan Highway Project (up to US $10 million),
and the Third Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Project (about US $17 million),
are scheduled for February.



PART II - DESCPIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
10.       Borrower:            Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiary:         Industrial Development Bank of
Pakistan (IDBP)
Amount:              The equivalent in various currencies of
US $20 inillion
Purpose:             To help IDEP to finance the foreign
exchange costs of industrial projects
of privat-e enterprises in Pa.istan
Amortization:        In 50 years including a 10 year grace
period through seciii-annual installmen-s
of '2 of ld from NIay 1, 1980 through
NTovember 1, 1989 and of 1½% from May 1,
1990 through November 1, 201°.
Service Charge:      3/4 of 1,' per annum
Relending Terms:     Islamic Republic of Paldstan will relend
to IDBP at the standard rate of interest
applicable to Bank loans as at the time
of the signing of the Development Credit
Agreement, with a conmitment charge of
3/4 of l/°J per annum0  Amortizatiorn will
be in semi-annual installments expected
to begin on October 31, 1972 and end on
October 31, 1986. Payments w-ill be based
on a composite amortization schedule
made up of the amortization schedules of
the individual sub-loans financed under
the project.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Industrial Development
Bank of Pakistan" (No. D3-58) is attached.
12.       IDBP wras constituted by the Industrial Developmen-t Bank of
Pakistan Ordinance of 1961. The Government of Pakistani holds 51.0
percent of the share capital and indirectly controls a further 5.7
percent;  the Government of 'Xest Pakistan holds 1.7 percent, foreign-
owned institutions 7.6 percent and some 219 Pakistani private share-
holders the remaining 34.0 percent. IDBP's Board comprises eleven
members, of wlhom the Chairman, six Directors and the Rlanaging Director
are appointed by the Government; three are appointed by the other



- 6 -
shareholders.  Government apnroval of certain decisicosof t'e Board i-s
required. However, apart from the so-called lladmiinistered loans"  and
the Sui Northern Gas Pipeline debentures (both described in detail in
paragraphs 69-71 of the Appraisal Report), the Government has not direct-
lv intervened in IDBPls investment decisions.  For tne future, the Go,rern-
ment has given assurances that IDBP wifl, in making in-vestment decisions,
be governed by its own assessment of the economic and financial vi.ability
of projects.
13.       IDBP has a well quialified management and a fair cadre of compe-
tent professional staff.  IDBP is implementing several programs to improve
its procedures, principally by delegating more authority, by increasing
supervision of matters needing special atuention and by introducing a
central accounting systen.  The Government and IDBP have also given assur-
ances to re'vieu the Ordinance rNith a view to streamlining IDBP1s proce-
dures, such as the abolition cf the Technical Ad%isory Comm_ttees. To
assure the Association an opportunity to review much of IDBP's appraisal
work, prior approval of 1BiPIs loans will be reqluired except for indozv:d-
ual projects needing less than US $2Q0O0,O e:uivalent of tbe c'edit; she
aggrezgae c individual prcjec_s exefpted from the AssociatZonls r:or
apprcval is not to exceed US $6 million equivalent. The crerdit wqill be
used exclusively for financing inported machinery and equip,ment, imported
through nornal commercial channels.
14.       ItEP has become one of the two most important financial inter-
mediaries for private industrial development in Pakistan.  Its lending
has concentrated heavily on the export-oriented industries of textiles
and jute (33 percent and 17 percent respectively of total lending).
IDBP has, moreover, made special efforts to assist in East Pakistan,
where hl percent of the total amount of past lending has been directod&
IDB? hopes to increase this percentage in its future operations. Fcr
the next phase of Pakistan's industrialization, adequate facilities for
the financing of industrial investment will be very important. Among
the chief priorities for investment are the expansion of the domestic
jute processing industry, the modernization of the textile industry and
the encouragement of certain engineering and chemical industries. IDBP
shiould continue to play a key role in financing these developments.
15.       As of June 30, 1969, IDBP had approved 3,720 loans (including
guarantees of foreign suppliers' credits) totalling Rs. 2,137 million
(US $5L9 million equivalent).  Foreign exchange loans represent 80 per-
cent of this total: rupee loanE and equity investment are generally
complementary to the foreign exchange business.  The f'oreign exchange
risk is borne by the borrower from IDBP.  Loans outstanding on June 30,
1969 amounted to Rs. °50 million (US $206 million equivalent).
16.       IDBP's capital structure is now much stronger than at the time
of the Bankts first appraisal. At June 30, 1970, the debt/equity ratio
is expected to be 4.3:1.  It is projected to increase sligh?tly to L.6:1
in 1973.  Provision is made in the Project Agreement to limit it to 5$1.
Earnings in 1963/69 were equivalent to 12.6% on average net worth and
24.5% cn share capital.  interes-t was covered about A.4 times in 196r/69
and this ratio is expected to remain constant until at least 1973/74.
17.    The average size of IDSP's loans is Rs. 3.6 nill_ion, coapared
with PICIC's average of Rs. 2.5 million. ID3P's loans under Rs. 0.5
million reDresent 81 percent of the total number of its comnitmnents, but



- 7 -
only 17 percent in amount. For the purposes of the smaller loans, IDBP
cooperates in a program with the East and West Pakistan Small Industries
Corporations (EPSIC,  PSIC) under which it extends loans, sponsored and
appraised by these corporations and assumes 25 percent of the risk involved.
These activities absorb a disproportionate amount of IDBP's administrative
time and expense;  and the arrangement with EPSIC and WPSIC does not
operate efficiently. The Government recognizes the need to streamline the
machinery for financing small business and it has given assurances that it
will formulate appropriate measures to this end and enable IDBP to termi-
nate its operations with EPSIC and WPSIC as soon as practicable.
18.       IDBP's loans have been mostly for ten or fifteen years, the dura-
tion being fixed by a Government directive requiring uniform repayment
periods. This reouiremeint imposes unnecessary rigidities in IDBP's lending.
It is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit Agreement that the Govern-
ment eliminate the requirement so that IDBP can fix each repayment period
on the basis of the nature and financial aspects of the relevant project.
19.       ID3P's portfolio includes a considerable number oi accounts
in default. Excluding arrears of less than six months and loans which
are totally or substantially covered by guarantee, the loans in default
represent 16 percent of the total portfolio. This percentage is high.
The poor quality of IDBP's appraisal and follow-up in the past is partly
responsible, but the level of arrears also reflects the difficulties
faced by medium and small business in Pa.;istan, particularly in East
Pakistan, where IDBP has been making special efforts to assist. IDBP
is endeavoring to remedy the situation, by improving its appraisals,
by pursuing strict policies of enforcement and oy rescheduling debt
or lending working capital in appropriate cases.  A full assessment of
IDBP's loan portfolio has just been made by a competent firm of account-
ants and their report concludes that the cover for arrears is adequate.
20.       IDBP's lending rate on loans in foreign exchange is 87 percent,
and on rupee loans, 8 percent-5 percent depending on the size of the
loan.  Since the proposed credit will be relent to IDB? at 7 percent, IDBP
will have a spread on this money of only l- percent.   IDBP has given
assurances that its interest rates will taoe account of the cost of the
capital provided, but at present IDBP has little say in the matter, since
the rates are fixed by the Government. The Bank Group has for scae time
been urging the Goverrment to review the interest rate question.   The
Government has given assurances that, in conjunct-on w,ith the reconsidera-
tion of industrial policy inoW being undertaken, it wjill review the
effectiveness of Pakistan's interest rate structure in encouraging savings
and ensuring the economic allocation of resources.
21.       Projections in the Appraisal Report on IDBP's operations for
1969/70through 1973/74 indicate that total commitments will amount to
Rs. 1,338 million (US $281 million equivalent), shouing a 59 percent in-
crease over total commitments of' Rs. 839 million (US $176 million equivalent)
in the previous five years. IDBP's rate of lending has been declining since
1964 and this has been largely due to the shortage of foreign exchange
resources. The Association's Credit is exp"7ected to finLance one-third of
IDBP's total foreign exchange recuirements in the next twJo years, with the
balance to be provided from the Asian Development Bank wad bilateral sources.
With these resources, IDBP should be able to increase its business in line
with the projections.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRIUTENTS AND AUTHORITIES
22.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and IDBP, the Recommendation of the Comniitte&-pro-
vided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the ve.t
of a Resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
23.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and draft Project
Agreement contain provisions usual to agreements for loans and credits
benefitting development finance companies.  Section 3.02 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement provides for the relending of the proceeds
of the Credit by the Government of Pakistan to IDBP pu-rsuant to a Sub-
sidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Association. The Subsidiary
Loan Agreement will contain provisions regarding interest rate, commit-
ment charge and repayment of principal imposing on IDBP debt service
obligations with respect to the proceeds of the Credit equivalent to
those applicable if a Bank loan had been made directly to IDBP.
PART V - THE ECONO1r11
2)4.      A Report on the Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Pakistan (SA-4a), dated April 18, 1969, has been distributed to the
Executive Dire8tors.  It referred to the social and political unrest
that led to a change in government in March 1969.  The new government
announced in Nlovember 1969 that unitary government in West Pakistan
would be dissolved in July 1970, and that elections would be held in
October 1970 for a National Assembly which is to draw up a new con-
stitution.  The social unrest that occurred in 1969, and the political
uncertainties, have contributed to Pakistan's uneven econornic perform-
ance in 1969 and help to explain the relatively low rate of investment
in that year, the sluggishness of industrial output and the slowdown
in Pakistan's export growth.  On the positive side, however, a record
wheat crop of 6.5 million tons has added credibilit-y to the claims of
a significant sustainable breu?through in agriz;;L'ctural prod:iction, as
evidenced further by a 50 per.,e nt increase in rice pVO,tAct'on in West
Pakistan. Economic growth, therefore, may still reach 5.5 0(rcent in
1969 - the terminal year of Pakistan's Third Five-Year Plan - bringing
the overall rate of GNP growth to an average of just under six percent
for the Third Five-Year Plan, a commendable achievement under the cir-
cumstances.
25.       During the last decade, Pakistan has achieved an impressive
rate of industrial growth and - in that period-managed to build up a
considerable industrial structure which provides a solid base for
further sustained advance in the future. While the initial phase of



-9-
industrialization was import-substituting, the distinctiive feature of
Pakcistan's industry is now its export orientation. In the process, some
serious problems have arisen. There is underutilization of industrial
capacity and serious price distortions have arisen, in considerable part
due to the framework of government policies that was shaped to cope with
the problems of reduced foreign aid availability and of the compartmental-
ization of foreign exchange resources. None of these problems can be
solved in the short run but with the help of the Bank's Industrial Policy
Mission the Government has been thinking about possible solutions to
these problems so as to ensure that industrial growth can continue on a
sound basis. In view of the good record that Pakistan has established
over the years in dealing with major issues of economic policy, there
is reason to believe that appropriate changes in industrial policy will
be introduced.  These changes wqould be part of the set of policy changes
required for the successful implementaion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan
which is now being prepared.
26.       The social and political unrest of 1969 has raised some import-
ant questions about the feasibility of continuing policies that aim at
accelerating economic growth in the face of declining net foreign aid
availability. The evidence so far demonstrates the need for Government
to pay more attention to the problems of income distribution, urbanization
and East-.ivest relations which admittedly were aggravated as a result of
Government policies that had to take into account the decline in foreign
aid while maintaining a growth strategy. Sizeable wage increases, there-
fore, have been granted in 1969 - particularly to the industrial labor
force, and to government employees - to rectify the situation.   These
increases, however, have tended to make it more difficult for Pakistan
to mobilize domestic resources in support of its development program.
The Fourth Five-Year Plan which is still in the preparatory stage will
be examined by a Bank economic mission scheduled to visit Pakistan in
March 1970. Its draft outline suggests that Pakistan will aim in the
first half of the 1970's to maintain the relatively high tempo of eco-
nomic development, reduce regional income disparity, make the economy
increasingly self-reliant and move towards a viable balance between
economic growth and social progress.
27.       While there must remain considerable uncertainty about the
economic policies to be followed by the new Government that will be
elected to office in a year or so, during its short history Pakistan
has displayed great pragmatism in shaping her development. This,
together with the dynamism of its entrepreneurs in industry as well
as in agriculture - should assure Pakistan's favorable long-term
growth prospects. A critical element in Pakistan's development,
however, will undoubtedly be the availability of sufficient foreign
aid. This subject will be discussed with Consortium members in Paris
at the end of February 1970. There is no doubt that Pakistan's
external debt position has become difficult largely as a result of
heavy borrowing on hard terms to supplement inadequate amounts

of soft assistance. Most of this debt will fall due during the next
five years or so, and to provide the net inflow of foreign resources
to sustain adequate economic grow+h and to protect the balance of pay-
ments, adjustments in assistance policies towards Palkistan are now
called for. In those circumstances, and considering Pakistan's good
record of economic management, the proposed IDA credit is clearly
justified cn economic grounds.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOiNENDATILON
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Deve'loprient Credit.
