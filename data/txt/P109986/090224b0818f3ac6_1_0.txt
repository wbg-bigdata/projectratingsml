                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation services in selected rural and urban areas. This will contribute to the
                         achievement of the water and sanitation MDGs. The proposed project will achieve its objective by (i) facilitating access to services through programs for improving and
                         extending water production and distribution systems and urban sanitation networks, constructing social water and sanitation household connections, public standpipes
                         and on-site sanitation facilities, and (ii) consolidating the achievements of the urban water reform, supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening
                         capacities to deliver and manage water and sanitation services.

                         The overall project implementation progress is satisfactorily and measurable development impacts are noted on the ground. In urban areas, 190,000 people, representing 100% of
                         the end-of-project-target (EOPT) have gained access to piped water, and 19,000 people (28% of EOPT) have gained access to improved sanitation services. Water production works
                         are underway in rural areas, but no development impact on access to water has been noted at this stage. Performance is modest on rural sanitation with only 2 blocks of school
                         latrines and 551 individual latrines (benefiting 5,500 people - 3% of the EOPT) completed.

                         With regards to the reforms, (i) 93 rural water users associations (representing 73% of EOPT) have been established under the project, (ii) bidding documents for the delegation of
                         the maintenance of rural water systems to private operators, are being finalized in view to launch the selection by march 2013, and (iii), negotiations are underway to extend the
                         urban water affermage contract for another five (5) years.
