                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the proposed project is to increase access to sustainable water and sanitation services in selected rural and urban areas. This will contribute to the
                         achievement of the water and sanitation MDGs. The proposed project will achieve its objective by (i) facilitating access to services through programs for improving and
                         extending water production and distribution systems and urban sanitation networks, constructing social water and sanitation household connections, public standpipes
                         and on-site sanitation facilities, and (ii) consolidating the achievements of the urban water reform, supporting the rural water subsector reform and strengthening
                         capacities to deliver and manage water and sanitation services.

                         The overall project implementation progress is satisfactorily and measurable development impacts are noted on the ground. In urban areas, 206,160 people, representing 108% of
                         the end-of-project-target (EOPT) have gained access to piped water, and 35,000 people (44% of EOPT) have gained access to improved sanitation services. Water production works
                         are underway in rural areas and first impacts are are noted with 27,380 additional people (21% of EOPT) having now access to safe drinking water. Performance has significantly
                         improved in rural sanitation with the construction of 24 blocks of school latrines and 3,112 household benefiting to 31,120 people - 18% of the EOPT, compared with the previous rate

                         of 3% noted in October 2012.

                         Moreover the following progress has been achieved: (i) 125 rural water users associations (representing 98% of EOPT) have been established under the project, (ii) bidding
                         documents for the delegation of the maintenance of rural water systems to private operators are under review for no-objection by DCMP (Central Direction for Public Markets) before
                         launching the selection, and (iii) negotiations are underway (up to June 30) to extend the urban water affermage contract for another five (5) years.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Key recommendations of the MTR: (i) to closely follow-up implementation of the rural sanitation component, (ii) to launch the bidding process to select private operators for the
                         maintenance of rural water systems by end of June 2013, (iii) to formally request the project restructuring including the reallocation of the credit proceeds and minor changes agreed
                         during the MTR mission.
