MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
ASSOCUITION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDlT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR A RURAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROJECr
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit to the Republic of
Malawi for SDR 18.0 million (US$25.0 million equivalent) are submitted for your approval. The
proposed Credit would be repayable over 40 years, indcuding a grace period of ten years at sdard
IDA terms. It would help finance a program to imprisve the access to financial services for the rural
sctr and increase competition In the financial system of Malawi.
2.    Backgrdund. Despite a series of adjustment programs, Malawi remains one of the poorest
countries in the world with a per capka GNP of US$210 (1992). Malawi is extremely vulnerable to
external shocks because of its geographically land-locked posiion and narrow resource base.
Although the county has made coi,siderable progress on the macroeconomic front over the past four
years, the medium-term economic outlook is highly uncetain because of:
the extnal shocks and the adverse impact of an unprecedented dwught in 1992
throughout Southern Africa; and
3     deteriorating relations with bilateral donors due to unresolved iswes reated to
governance.
3.    Malawi's development strategy following Independence in 1964 emphasized infrastructure and
agrclture as vehicles for increased production. While the estate sub-sector was deemed to be the
diving force for export growth, producer prices in the smallholder sub-setor were kept below world
market levels to transfer resources from the smallholder sector into the estate and agro-processing
sub-sectors. The county succesflly exploited its endowment during the 1960s and 1970s when real
GDP more thn doubled and real per capita income grew by 3 percent per year. ITe period of strong
eonomic growth came to a halt in the early 1980s when the county faced a combination of
unfvorable tems of trade, high interest rates, weatherrelated shocks, and other major domesi
policy weakneses. The first series of adjustment operations was a response to this set of shocks.
However, while the Government of Malawi (GOM) was adjustig to these shocks, the country was hit
in the mid-1980s by a worsening of the war and civil strife in neighboring Mozambique which not
only led to a major increase in inteational transporation cost but also to increased security-reted
expendiures and a large influx of refugees. ihis cawd shap deterioration in the m c
environment in the mid-1980s. With the partial reopening of the Nacala rail route to M ique in
October 1989, and the recent peace ageement, the Moambique siuation is Improving but remains
very unceain  Certain policy responses to this second and more dramatic set of shocks, including
expanded fiscal deficits and implementation of import controls, compounded the difficulties and
discouraged private sector investments and outpu.
4.    In 1992, the economy was affected by two major shocks. The wvere drought of 1992 sharply
reduced the maize crop by nearly 60 percent. Widespread poverty and food iserity  merged as
important soci dimensions to the economic difficulties. This has resulted in additional foreign
xchange requirements of US$236 million for maize imports in order to avoid widespread food
shortages, malnutition and strvato  In addition, drought-related expendiu  for Intenal
distribution of emergency food aid, water supply rehabilitaion, and health programs have furher
worsened the Government's fiscal difficulties. Furthemore, at the May 1992 Consutative Group



-2 -
(CG), bilateral donors and the European Community (EC) refained from pledging additional  ternal
assistance to Malawi mainly becuse of reasons related to political governance. To close the resuldng
fiscal and extal fiancing gap, the Malawian autorities implemented an austerity packae in June
1992, comprising - inter alia - 22 percent devaluation of the Kwadha, strict expendure controls and
additional tghtening of the monetary policy. These measures have helped the economy to remain
broadly on track. Nevertheless, dmely resumption of bilateral and EC exten  support, e.g. balance
of payments support, is crucial for the successful continuation of the adjustment program.
5.    The Government's objectives for the rura economy, of which agriculture and agriculture-
related activities form the most important part, are to promote economic growth, raise nrur Incomes,
ensure food security, and increase export earnings while conserving natural resources. Specifically,
as indicated in the Statement of Develkpment Policies (1987-96), the rural sector objectives are to
improve the economic and social conditions of the rural commities through productive self-help
programu which would enable them to contribute filly to national economic development. These
objectives are being pursued through programs undertaken wih support from IDA and several donor
agencies (IFAD, UNDP, USAID, NDF,GTZ, ODA, and EEC) with emphasis on: (a) promoting
private sector involvement in viable rural activites; (b) providing inives through liberalizing the
pricing and marketing system, and increasing producer prices of export crops; and (c) rehabilitating
rural infrsructre, and providing support services (research, extension, and input supply).
6.    Although several government programs have been put in place to develop the rural sector, the
productivity of smallholders is still constrained to a great eten  by limited access to fiancial
services. The National Rural Development Program (NRDP) was established as the main vehicle for
providig institutional credit to smallholders. Under NRDP, the coury was divided into eight
Agricultr Development Divisions (ADDs), each supported through a line of credit by different
donors. In 1988, with the assistance of IDA and IFAD, the Governmt consolidated all the credi
programs under the SmalMholder Agricultural Credit  niion (SACA), a department wihin the
Ministy of Agriculture (MOA). SACA, like NRDP before it, chnneled credk to smaliholders
through groups (Farmers Clubs) and achieved high recovery rates, averaging over 90 percent In the
1991/92 season, SACA disbursed approxnimately MK 80 million to about 330,000 beneficiaries (of
whom 93,500 were women), represting about 23 percent of rura households. Other financial
institutions dta serve the rural sector, such as Small Enterprise Development Organization of Malawi
(SEDOM), Malawi Union of Savings and Credit Cooperatives Ltd (MUSCCO), and Malawi Mudzi
Fund (MMF), which are also set up to provide credit primariy to microentprises not served by the
commercial banks, are less successful in achieving their objectives despite their high cost of
operations. Several steps are being taken to remedy their management deficiencies. It is recognized,
however, that improvemens in their performance would be slow to matialze, and their impact in
rural areas would be modest in view of their scale of operations.
7.    In connection with the preparation of the proposed Project, an in-depth review of the fnancial
services currently available to te rural sector was undertake. The data from this review show dtat
limted access to financial services remains one of the man impediments to sustained economic
growth In the rural sector. There are newly developed high yielding technologies available for maize
production, which have the potial to double the estimated daily return to labor of smallholders, but
the access to credit is an important prerequisite for the adoption of these innovations by a critical
mass of smalilolders. The fiancial instiutions (both formal and informal) dth serve tbe rral sector
do not provide adequat services, and are not easily accessible to large segments of smallholder
hfmers and microenterprises. The IDA-financed Financia Sector and Enterprise Developme
Project (FSEDP) is providing the fiamework for reformig the financia sector. However, as



- 3 -
Indicated in the Malawi Finamcial Sector Report, the liberalization and deepenig of the fiancial
system is recognized as a long-term goal. Experience from other countries shows that following
liberaization of the financl sector, commercial banks are generally not likely to increase lending to
agriculte or small-scale rural enterprises becs transaction costs and risks are higher ta in other
sectors. Furthermore, the two commercial bank in Malawi lack the infstrcture, instrument,
experience and managerial capacity to mobilize ura savmg and channel adequate resources to viable
rral enterprises. Besides, there is no effective competition in the banking system, hence the
commercial ban  have no incentive to build infrastructure, develop expertise, or cultivate with
innovative techniques for lending to the rural sector. In the short to medium term, therefore, the
financial needs of the rural sector, particularly of the emerging rural enterprises, are not likely to be
met through the existg channels in thei prese  state.
S.    The data from a review of Ma-ai's rur  finance sector carried out by IDA in 1992 show
that limited access to fiancial services remains one of the man constraints threatening sustained
economic growth in the rural sector. This review also concluded that SACA, the Governmentms main
vehicle for channelling credit to the rural sector, as cuently constituted could not be sustainable,
given high subsidization (about MK 4.0 million per year and rising) and heavy involvement of
ension staff in the provisions and recovery credit. In addition, SACA is currently serving only
twenty-three percent of Malawi's rural households, with litde prospect of either expanding the
coverage or developing new and more suitable instuments for lending to the rural sector, becase the
management of SACA is stifled by overt goverment involvement. When NRDP was consolidated
into SACA in 1988, it was anticipated that SACA would evolve into a fill service bank. According
to the review, there is a very strong case for privatizing and converting SACA into a rural bank,
capable of serving wider segment of the rural populaton, including developing new and appropriate
instuments for lending to the rural sector. Given the present stage of Malawi's financi sector
development and the limited competition within the banking system, converting SACA Into a bank is
compelling. Transformation of SACA into a viable fianci institution will, nonetheless, have to
proceed in a phased manner to ensure meaningful private sector participation.
9.    Project Objectves. The Project's fundamental objective is to improve the access to financia
services for the rural sector, incluiding women, on a sustanable basis. The immediat objective of the
Project is to lay the foundaion for sustainability of rural financial services by corporatizing and
converting SACA into an autonomous company and preparing it for privadzation and transformat
into a private rural bank.
10.   PIroject Descripton. Ihe Project would be implemented over a three year priod and has
three main componens: (1) axfasx kwbadding component (US$16.7 million or 45 percen of
total Project costs) woud support (a) the corportzation and conversion of SACA into an auonomous
lmited liability company (Malawi Rural Finance Company) which is the first phase of a two phased
program of pnvatizing and transforming SACA Into a private rural bank; and (b) the use of
Development of Malawi Traders Trust (DEMATr) to assist in prepaing investment proposas for
agriculura and small- and micro- entprises and to provide training to rural enreprenus; (2) a kw
of chditoonent (US$20.0 million or 55 percent of total Project costs) would finance primarily
short-term loan requiremens of farm and non-farm rural activities; and (3) apilotprogram
conponent would support initiatives to test innovaive approaches for providing financial services to
women entrepreneurs engged in income-generating activities in the rural sector.
11.   Project 1nadnag. The estmated total project cost would be US$36.7 million. IDA would
fnance US$25.0 million (68 percent), of which US$8.0 million would be for instution building and



-4-
US$17.0 million would be for the line of credit. The balance would be financed by Government -
US$4.0 million (11 percent), MRPC - US$4.7 million (13 percent), and the remaining US$3.0
million (8 percent) would be conributed by the beneficiaries (smallholders, microentiprlss, etc.) in
the form of equity contribution for sub-projects. lhe costs and financing plan for the Project are
provided in Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement details are provided in Schedule B. The
timetable of key processing events is provided in Schedule C. The status of Bank operations in
Malawi and the staement of IFC investments are provided in Schedule D.
12.   Project Implemenmton. All project components would be implemened by MRFC which,
though newly established, would be staffed by a large number of the former SACA staff who are
experienced in agriculural credit and are implementing an ongoing lIDA-financed project. Project
implementation in Malawi in the past has suffered from weak institutional capacity and slow
disbursement, particularly in the public sector. The implementation problem is caused by a shortage
of experienced manpower, poor knowledge of Bank's disburement procedures and policies, and lack
of counterpart fiuds. IDA has taken actions to alleviate the problem of slow disbursement by
caying out disbursement workshops in Malawi and providing assistance to vaious government
agencies in resolving disbursemen issues and clearing the backlog. However, this Project would be
Implemented by private sector entitles, and given the safeguards buil intD the project design, this
problem is not likely to adversely affect project implementation.
13.   Project Sustainabllty. The MRFC would be an autonomous financial institution, operating
on a commercial basis without government interference. The Project would conibute to deepening
the rural financi system ud imWproving the accessibility of financial services to the rural sector by
developing new instuments for lendig to viable rural activities, including farm and non-farm
enterprises. The Project would have no inremea recurrent expenditure implications for the
government budget.
14.   Lesso  Learned from Rural hiauce Opertons. IDA has supported several rural finance
projects in Malawi. These projects indicate that group lending is an effective instument for
providing credit to the rural sector, with high loan recovery rates (averaging over 90 percent),
provided the groups are self-selected, cohesive and voluntary. Experience also shows ta a disort
financial system, inadequate project design, weak isitional capacity, and unrealistic project scope
adversely affect project perfonnance. These factors have been taken into consideration in the design
of the proposed Project. The instional capacity would be strengthened, and the project design has
beea kept simple. In additon, up-front actions would be taken before project approval. Bi-annual
project reviews, including a mid-term review of project performance, would be und n at the end
of the second year of the Project to address specia issues tat may arise during project
implementaion and warant mid-course correcton.
15.   Rationale for MDA Involvement and LAnka with Country Stategy. Support for the rural
sector is an important element of IDA's assistae strate  in Malawi, aimed at fostering economic
growth, food security, poverty reduction, off-farm employment, and protectig the natural resource
base. IDA has developed a two-pronged approach to assist the Govenment in its efforts to overcome
the constaits fbcing the rura sector, namely the execution of finacial policy reforms, including
incraing the accessibility of financial services, and the rehabilition and improvement of key
agricultural sevices. IDA Credits designed to support the Government's sectoral policies
(Agrcultural Sector Adjutme  Program, Agricultural Research, Extension and Planning, and
Fisheries Development Projects) are insumental in providing the environment for, and direct
suppor to the development of ural enterprises. The proposed Rural Fianci Services Project would



complement the financial reforms under FSEDP to improve access to financial seices for dhie ru
sector. It would finance expansion of agriculturd production and a4option of new and improved
technologies, suppeot the development of rural commercial investments, and assist the expansion of
vizole rural activities. More importantly, IDA involvement would help ensure the succesu
corporatzation and conversion of SACA into an autonomous limited liability company, with
commercial operating policies and procedures, which is the first step in the process of privatzing and
transforming SACA into a full service rural bank.
16.   Agreed Actions. Assurances on the following matters were obtained during negotiations: (a)
MRFC would be a limited liability company and would be autonomous in policy, operational and
management matters and function on a commercial basis; (b) Govenment woud embark on
transformig MRFC into a rural bank under the Banking Act of 1989 with meaningful private sector
participation within three years; (c) RBM would adopt acceptable mechanisms, t     an d conditions
of on-lendig to MRFC; (d) Goverment would send to IDA at least once a year an assessment of the
impact of the Project on beneficiaries; and (e) MRFC would ensure duth investments financed under
the Project would not have negative environmental impacts. The appointment of MRFC's General
Manager and Financial Controller and the signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement betwhee the
Government and MRFC are conditions of Credit Effectiveness. The conditions of disbursement for
the Line of Credit Component are the finalization of MRPC organization structure, manuals and
policies and procedures acceptable to IDA, and the transfer to MRFC of the activities, assets and
liabiliies of SACA.
17.   Environmental Aspects. Activities to be financed under the Project would be small in scale
and pose no major environmenval issues. Under the Project, environmental guidelines would be
provided to the MRFC aud investors. Where necessay, environmenta assessments would be caried
out and subproject designs modified to include mitigaing measures. Annual lending programs would
be reviewed by the Environmental Unit in the Department of Research and Eavironental Affairs,
Office of the President and Cabinet.
18.   Project Relevance to Program of Special Emphasis. The Project would have a favorable
impact on key areas of special emphasis: (J) rural poverty alleviation would result ftom increased crop
production and non-farm incomes earned from income genag acdvities; (ii) food security would
improve with increased agriculurua production and non-farm incomes; (iii) improvement In the
economic and social condition of women would result from supportig incomegeneratig activies,
especially those tdat are owned and managed by women; and (iv) private sector developame would
be facilitated through privatizing government credit activities by conveting SACA into an
autonomous limited liability company, and by implementing the Project through private sector
entities.
19. Project Benefits. Ihe proposed IDA Credit would support additional new investments by
improving the availability and accessibility of credit to rural households for viable farm and non-faum
activities. The number of households that would benefit from the Project would be expanded from
330,000 currently served by SACA to more than 500,000 rural households (an additional 170,000
households or 52 percent). The Project would, therefore, strengthen and expand the production base
of the rural sector, increase employment and household Incomes. This would result in reducing rura
poverty while enhancng and accerating the economic development of ural areas of Malawi. In
financing smailholder agriculture and by releasing extension staff to undertake genune extension
work, the Project would support measures necessary to obtain the required production response from
agriculture that would help in increasing Malawi's export eanings, enhacing food security and



-6-
nutritonal intake, and improving mral incomes and living sandards. The improved access to credit
by micro-, smal- and medium-scale enterrises (MSMSEs) opeating in the rural areas will improve
real sector supply response. The support for MSMSEs, including women entrepreus, is likely to
gener  higher levels of employmeat. Since the involvement of women in this Project is of primary
importance, an Acdon Plan was developed for hcreasing the availability of credit to women. ITe
effective monitoring of the Action Plan would alleviate one of the major constaints facing women
entrepreneurs.
20. Projed Risks. The main risks would be: (i) possible economic slowdown which could
reduce the capac& y of farmers to repay their loans, result in higher default rates, and undermine the
viability of MRC; (ii) delays in progress toward Goverament's liberalization of input supply and
marketing, or in the pace of implementing the financial reforms as agreed under the Financial Secor
and Enterprises Development Project, which could discourage new investments; and 4iii) delays in
implementIg the restructuing of vital rural institutons. Theso risks are considered to be minimal
because the Project is designed to overcome these risks and required up-front actions. The prospet
for achieving the Project's objectives are very good.
21.   Remmedation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the Articles of
Agreemen of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

MALAWI
RURAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PROJECT
Disbrsement Delays
Ihe Bank's portfolio in Malawi is ftirly large and includes 19 ongoing opeatons.
While some improvement in project implementaton was recorded, the Governmen's limiked
capacity to implement the project remains the major issue. One of the issues observed in the
project mplemenion is the slow disburseen, i.. slower han originally anticipated in the
SAR. As hidicated in the attached Table, the overall disbs    (as of March 31, 1993)
were about 55% of the approved credits. Ihe und ed amount was affected by delays in
of Power V Project and in the release of the second tranche under EDD1RP.
it is also relevat to Me however, that 11 out of 19 operations are about 3 years old or less
(stated in 1989 or later). The major generic problems (on the Malawi side) in disburemen
are: (a) shortage of taIned/expeienced staff resulting in inalequ   knowledge of Bankes
procedures; (b) frequent turnover of disburent staff; (c) lack of countea
funds; and (d) lack of staff incentives. On the Bak's side, disbu   are slowed down
by: (a) too complex project components; (b) occasional Bank's staff delays in procuremen
pprowval; and (c) project budget isues not resolved at project egotations. To remedy the
problems, a number of disbursement worksop were carried out In additon, In FY93 the
following actions have been taken (i) disbursement workshop was carried out in Malawi (and
will contiue in fture once a year) for disbursement officers working m the Govement and
in parastatals; (ii) Bank disbursement officer visited malawi twice to assist vaious
n        istries/agencies in resolving pending disbursement issues and clearing the bacldog. As a
long-tem approach, following the CIR (May 1993), the Govenment is expected to prepare
an action program on how to imprve project Impla ion Including improvement in
disbursements.
