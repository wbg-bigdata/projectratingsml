MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A NATIONAL RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 14.2 million (US$18.4 million) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would assist in financing a project to reestablish
the national research and extension network and to provide support to the
development of farmer organizations.
2.        Background. After two decades of economic mismanagement and
deterioration, the Government of Guinea launched an ambitious economic and
financial reform in late 1985. Major progress was made during 1986 and 1987
toward liberalizing the economy, with priority given to the agricultural
sector. This encouraged a significant supply renponse. However, the policy
changes alone have not been sufficient to realiza the sector's full
potential. The prospect for significant growth is constrained by farmers'
lack of confidence in even the meager support services which exist, lack of
suitable technical advice for farmers, uon existent credit and input supply
mechanisms, and dilapidated infrastructure. Gainea has some capable staff,
and certain research stations still have some infrastructure with a stock of
suitable genetic materials. However, because- of lack of equipment and
operating funds and of a nationally oriented strategy, research and extension
services have not been operational. In addition, the Government's former
direct involvement created distrust in farmer organizations, and only now are
farmers beginning to organize into cooperatives.
3.        Recognizing these problems the Government has given priority to the
improvement and rehabilitation of rural infrastructure and agricultural
support services. Its strategy is to produce and transfer messages by
developing the local capacity to conduct decentralized adaptive research and
mass extension programs with the full participation of farmers. It is also
aware of the need to develop farmers' confidence in these services and
suitable farmer organizations to facilitate input supply, credit and
marketing. This strategy is already being implemented through the recently
approved IDA-financed National Seeds Project and the IDA-financed Extension
and Research Pilot Programs.
4.        Project Obiectives.  The proposed project would respond to the
Government's request for further assistance in rehabilitating the research
apparatus, establishing a sustainable extension system, and reestablishing
farmers' confidence in cooperatives to help the sector reach its potential.
This would be achieved by providing assistance in planning and management;
conducting research and extension; creating and consolidating links among
research, extension, and farmers; training staff; and developing an
institutional framework to promote farmer organizations.

5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The development of agricultural
support services has so far concentrated on area development or crop
development projects financed by various donors. This has resulted in a
duplication of efforts, inconsistent advice to farmers, and unsustainable
services. The Government's efforts to develop cooperatives have been
isolated and insufficient. IDA's involvement in the project is regarded by
the Government as key in helping to develop the national agricultural
services. In doing so, the project would help to consolidate and harmonize
the various doncrs' approaches and prevent the emergence of programs outside
the national strategy. Once short-term area development projects are
completed, the services established under these projects would be
consolidated into the national service, rather than disappearing. The
project is consistent with IDA's strategy for Guinea. It would build on
existing crop varieties and technologies, infrastructure and staff, ongoing
pilot programs, and organizations. It is an essential link in the chain of
agricultural projects financed by IDA in Guinea (Agricultural Services,
Livestock, Forestry, and Seeds Projects) and prospective investments
affecting the sector (Structural Adjustment Credit II, Rural Infrastructure
Project).
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project would be the first
five-year phase of a long-term plan for developing and strengthening
research, extension, and farmer organizations in Guinea. It would include:
(a) strengthening research stations to identify, select and test crop
varieties and production technologies; (b) establishing an off-station
research network to test the adaptability and acceptability of these
varieties and technologies in strict interaction with farmers; (c) training
local staff in commodity and cropping systems research, research and
extension methodologies, and management; (d) strengthening and reorganizing
extension services including activities aimed at improving women's
agricultural productivity; (e) strengthening the capacity of the State
Secretariat for Decentralization (SED) for developing cooperatives through
the creation of a national cooperative support agency (SNATC);
(f) strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal
Resources (MARA) and the State Secretariat for Scientific Research (SERS) for
overseeing project impact through the creation of small monitoring and
evaluation cells; (g) funding the preparation of projects and start-up
activities needed to achieve sector development; and (h) strengthening the
capacity of the research and extension structures for planning and managing
activities.
7.        The total cost of the five-year project is estimated at US$30.9
million equivalent, of which US$21.6 million (701) in foreign exchange. A
breakdown of costs and the tentative financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and method of procurement and disbursement, as well as the
disbursement schedule, are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Guinea are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing project coverage and
location of research centers is also attached. The staff Appraisal Report
No. 7277-GUI dated August 24, 1988, is being distributed separately. Two
Project Preparation Facilities (PPF) have been awarded: one to start the
Pilot Extension Program and the other to begin the training of key research
staff to prepare for project implementation.

8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following: (a)
project management units would maintain records and accounts; have accounts
audited; submit annual budgets, progress reports and a Project Completion
Report; recruit a financial manager or appoint an accounting firm and
establish a balance sheet at December 31, 1988; (b) key project staff would
be auth,orized to approve project expenditures; (c) the Government's portion
of incremental funding would be deposited; (d) the Di.ector of the National
Directorate for Agricultural Research (DNRA) would report to the State
Secretary for Scientific Research, DNRA would maintain its status as a
national directerate, and research centers would depend directly from the
Director, DNRA; (e) a mid-term review would be carried out, (f) the National
Research/Extension Committee to be created with membership satisfactory to
IDA would carry out, in consultation with IDA an annual review of programs,
strategies and budgets; (g) an agreement would be signed by MARA and SERS for
the execution of adaptive research; (h) SNATC would operate on the basis of
an organization and structure satisfactory to IDA; (i) local staff would
undertake tests before engaging in training; (j) technical specialists would
be recruited; and (k) two M&E cells would prepare a Monitoring and Evaluation
program. Conditions of effectiveness would be (a) the opening of project
accounts in local currency, in which the Government would have made an
initial deposit of GF 55 million, and (b) the submission of a satisfactory
action plan for compliance with the Government's debt reporting obligations
to the World Bank. The ct.;:ation of SNATC and the initial deposit by
Government of GF 10 million by June 30, 1989, would be a condition of
disbursement.
9.        Benefits.  Important benefits are expected from (a) MARA's and
SERS's increased ability to plan, coordinate, and implement research and
extension programs at the national level; (b) increased production of food
crops (about 1? per annum), and of root and fruit crops, thereby contributing
to food security and increased exports; and (c) increased incomes for most of
Guinea's rural community. The increase in food production and the
participation of women in extension activities would directly benefit women
as heads of rural households and as an important labor force in crop
production. Readily available technology delivered through the renewed
extension service would rapidly benefit over 200,000 rural families; research
results would, in the medium- to long-term, benefit the majority of the rural
families. A modest yield increase of 15? would give a 202 Economic Rate of
Return to the extension component. Additional benefits would derive from the
training of local staff and support to cooperative development.
10.       Risks.  In the current Guinean context, the project faces the risks
of ineffective management and coordination of research and extension
programs, failure to adhere to agreed priorities and balance in research
programs, and low adoption of research findings due to lack of confidence on
the part of farmers and inappropriate research conducted in isolation. The
first risk would be minimized by establishing an ad hoc committee for
research and extension, by providing technical assistance, and through the
establishment of contractual arrangements between the services to jointly
carry out adaptive research. This would ensure that adaptive research is
directed toward providing early results and that planning and coordination
are efficient. The second risk would be reduced by establishing research
priorities through an annual review of programs and budgets involving all
donors and farmers. The third risk is being addressed by the Pilot Extension



- 4 -
Program which has reestablished farmers' confidence and by emphasizing
on-farm research and linkage among research and extension staff and farmers
to make research and extension responsive to farmers' needs.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
