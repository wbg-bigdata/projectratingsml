4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project team has reviewed the draft Project Implementation Plan and found it substantially satisfactory.
Implementation Period. Five years.
Executing Agency and Principal Implementing Agency: The Directorate General of Human Settlements in the Ministry
of Public Works (DG Cipta Karya) will be the Executing Agency for the project and will be responsible for overall
technical supervision of the project on behalf of GOI. The Province of Bali will be the principal Implementing Agency.
An existing inter-ministerial coordination team for urban development (TKPP), chaired by the national planning board
(BAPPENAS), will provide overall policy guidance and sectoral oversight. A draft of the Provincial Project
Implementation Memorandum (PPIM), delineating the respective roles and responsibilities of the various levels of
government for project implementation, was reviewed at Negotiations. The PPIM, approved and signed by the relevant
authorities, is a condition for Loan Effectiveness.
A special functional organization, the Provincial Project Coordination Unit (PPCU), reporting to the head of the
provincial development planning agency (Bappeda 1), has been established through a Decree of the Provincial Governor
for overall management of the project. It will be headed by a senior person, who will be assigned full time for this task
during the first three years of the project. Each local government has established a special functional organization
(through a Decree), the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), headed by a competent person on a full-time basis, for overall
coordination of project related activities in its jurisdiction. The PCU will report to the head of the local Bappeda II.
Individual sub-projects will be implemented by the respective line agencies in the structural organization of government -
central, provincial, or local.
Annual Program Implementation Plan: The provincial government, the local governments, and the water enterprises
(PDAMs) will prepare Annual Program Implementation Plans (APIP) for the project, as part of GOI's annual
development planning exercise (Rakorbang). These will be based on the medium-term investment programs (PJMs)
developed during project preparation and will take into account emerging needs. The draft first year APIP was reviewed
during Negotiations and Bank approval of an acceptable first year APIP for each local government and PDAM is a
condition of disbursementfor goods, works and training. Draft APIPs for subsequent years will be presented by the
provincial government in October each year for joint GOI-Bank review.
ProjectAccounts andAudit: The provincial finance department will maintain the consolidated project account, and
produce consolidated financial reports. Assurances were obtained from GOI during Negotiations that the consolidated
project account, including the Special Account and the Statements of Expenditure (SOE), as well as the overall accounts
of the participating PDAMs, will be audited annually by independent auditors in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and
that the audited accounts would be furnished to the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year,
commencing GOI FY1997-98. Assurances were also obtained from GOI during Negotiations that the Bali Provincial
Inspectorate (ITWIL Prop) will carry out annual technical audits during project implementation.
Project Reporting and Monitoring: Quarterly progress reports (QPR) will be prepared by the PPCU and furnished to
GOI and the Bank within thirty days from the end of each quarter. Agreement will be reached with government on the
substance and the format of the QPR at project launch. Progress on achievement of agreed project performance
indicators will be reported annually. The Bank will formally supervise the project jointly with GOI twice a year; in
addition, there will be a number of short supervision missions each year from the Resident Mission. Implementation
progress will be reviewed at the end of each GOI fiscal year, and a mid-term review of the project will be carried out
jointly with GOI in the year 2000. The DG Cipta Karya, working closely with various implementing agencies, will
prepare GOI's contribution to the project's Implementation Completion Report within six months of the loan closing
date, for review by GOI and the Bank.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by the project:
The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia was discussed by the Board on March 21, 1995, and a
subsequent Progress Report was discussed in June 1996. These documents envisage that lending for infrastructure will
remain a large part of the Indonesia program and highlight the need for: (a) increasing the quality of urban services; (b)
greater decentralization of responsibility to local governments; (c) greater private sector and community participation;
and (d) environmental sustainability. The proposed project is consistent with these objectives and is an integral part of
the Bank's evolving urban development program in Indonesia.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector Issues
Indonesia's urbanization has accelerated during the past 15 years. The urban population has grown at an average of
nearly 6% per year, among the highest in Asia. The 1990 census reported that 55 million people (about 30% of the total
population of 190 million) are living or working in urban areas; this figure is expected to reach 90 million by the year
2000. In particular, population and settlements around major cities are growing at explosive double-digit rates.
Infrastructure Service Provision
The main issues faced in urban infrastructure service provision include: (a) serious infrastructure deficiencies and
operations and maintenance (O&M) backlogs; (b) lack of integration of infrastructure investments with land management
and transport objectives; (c) weak management of water enterprises and municipalities; (d) poor programming of design
and construction cycles; (e) complex relationships among local, provincial and central agencies with respect to
responsibilities for project and program preparation, appraisal, financing, implementation, and O&M; (f) shortage of
trained and experienced managerial and technical personnel; and (g) limited involvement of the private sector in urban
infrastructure.
Finances
Local government and PDAM infrastructure investments have been largely financed from a combination of central
development grants (INPRES grants) and direct intervention by central government sectoral ministries using their own
allocations within the State budget. GOI has recently announced a policy to phase out such direct intervention and will
instead transfer funds to local budgets through the INPRES grants system. Willingness to borrow is increasing,
especially in relation to investments in sectors where cost-recovery is possible, as revenue improvements are realized
through the Revenue Improvement Action Plan (RIAP) initiative.
Sectoral Coordination
The large size and diversity of the country, the rapid pace of urbanization, the number of concerned agencies, and poor
resource allocation and communication among agencies have led to a somewhat fragmented approach to urban
development.
Community Participation
GOI regulations for annual development budget preparation (the Rakorbang process) call for community consultation
and participation at all levels, but implementation of this process has been uneven and generally poor.
Government Strategy
In order to meet the sectoral needs, GOI's strategy emphasizes integrated and decentralized management of urban
development. GOI's Policy Statement for Urban Development, issued in 1987 and incorporated in the fifth five year
development plan - REPELITA V (1989/90-93/94) - emphasizes, inter alia: strengthening local governments' capacity to
plan, build, operate and maintain local investments and services; mobilizing local revenues; and strengthening
community consultation and participation. The operational approach of the policy, called the Integrated Urban
Infrastructure Development Program (IUIDP), requires local governments to prepare action plans for institutional
strengthening and improvements in resource mobilization, sector programming, and financing arrangements. The IUIDP

approach has been expanded in scope in REPELITA VI (1994/95 - 98/99) and is now known as the Integrated Urban
Development Program (IUDP).
Urban Issues in Bali and Government Strategy
Urban sector issues in Bali are similar to the issues discussed in the earlier paragraphs. Government strategy to address
them takes into account the special environmental and cultural considerations that are unique to Bali, as well as the
important role played by tourism, the province's leading economic sector. (Please see Background Note on Bali and
Project Design, available in Project Files.)
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project addresses a number of sectoral issues that are generic to Indonesia, as well as those that are specific to Bali.
In particular, the project addresses issues relating to: infrastructure service provision; private sector participation;
environmental sustainability; strengthening urban management capacity at provincial and local levels through
decentralization, greater community participation, revenue improvements, and better utilization of borrowing capacity;
and strengthening water supply organizations. A strategic decision has been made to exclude water supply investments
in Denpasar and Badung from BUIP loan proceeds, as there is strong potential for private sector investments.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Public versus Private Investments
The option of reserving all investments in revenue generating sectors, e.g., water supply, solid waste management,
markets, terminals, for private sector investment was examined. It has been agreed with GOI that private sector
participation (PSP) efforts under the project should focus on areas and sectors that have strong potential for
implementation in the medium-term, e.g., in Denpasar and Badung, particularly for water supply. Public investments
under BUIP are the chosen option in the remaining geographical areas and sectors.
Inter-urban Roads
The option of including investments for inter-urban roads in BUIP was considered, even though this is traditionally not a
part of IU(I)DP. It was decided to limit investments in roads and traffic management to urban centers only, because: (i)
they already constitute the single largest investment sector, and adding inter-urban roads would upset the sectoral balance
of this integrated project; (ii) a separate road sector project for the Denpasar area will be prepared by ADB shortly; (iii)
GOI wants to limit the size of BUIP loan, for reasons of regional balance; and (iv) preparation of an inter-urban road
component would delay implementation of BUIP, beyond GOI's preferred implementation target of early GOI FY 1997-
98.
9. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and
planned):
The Bank has financed 14 completed and 10 on-going urban and water supply projects in Indonesia since 1974. Annex 9
summarizes key data on these projects and the PPAR/PCRIICR and supervision ratings. In general, the IUIDP projects in
the portfolio are meeting the development objectives, and implementation performance (except for the Surabaya project,
where there have been some land acquisition delays) has been satisfactory.
The ADB and other donors also have a number of IUIDP projects under implementation. OECF has recently approved a
$60 million project in Bali to finance sewerage investments in Denpasar, Kuta, and Sanur. The ADB is expected to
support a Strategic Road Infrastructure Project in Denpasar shortly.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
* Overall Bank Experience. Bank involvement in the urban sector started in the early 1 970s with low cost investment
projects in shelter, water supply, sanitation, and urban transport, aimed at alleviating urban poverty. Many of these
projects succeeded in physical terms, but had little impact on the policies of national and local governments on urban
management. By the mid-1980s, the experience of donor-assisted projects had led to the recognition that central
governments alone were unable to meet the needs of infrastructure services for the rapidly growing urban
populations. Please also see Operations Evaluation Department's retrospective, OED Twenty Years of Lending for
Urban Development 1972-1992, Report No. 13117, 1994.

Country: Indonesia                                                                Project Title: Bali Urban Infrastructure Project
*  Experience in Indonesia. Urban lending operations in Indonesia have progressed from demonstration projects in
Jakarta, through more programmatic investments in other selected large cities, to sector lending within an agreed
policy and institutional framework. For a comprehensive review of the Bank's support for urban projects in
Indonesia till the eighties, please refer to a 1995 study carried out by OED entitled, "Indonesia: Impact Evaluation
Report, Enhancing the Quality of Life in Urban Indonesia - The Legacy of the Kampung Improvement Program"
(Report No. 14747- IND).
The East Java Bali Urban Development Project (EJBUDP; Loan 3304-IND), approved in 1991 and due to be
completed in 1997, and six other IUIDP/urban projects which were subsequently approved, represent the Bank's
support to GOI in implementing its urban policy under the IUIDP concept. The mid-term review of EJBUDP in 1994
concluded that the project had made substantial progress in demonstrating the feasibility of decentralizing
infrastructure planning and implementation as well as mobilizing local revenues. Many of the successful innovations
developed during EJBUDP (decentralization of urban services, integrated urban infrastructure development,
development of local government capacities, improving local resource mobilization, improving mechanisms for local
government borrowing and grant allocations, etc.) have since been replicated in subsequent Bank urban projects, as
well as in projects financed by other donors, particularly ADB.
*  Impact on BUIP. BUIP builds on the lessons of previous experience through its emphasis on: continued
decentralization; greater and more focused efforts at private sector participation; increased focus on environmental
sustainability; on-going community participation; support for capacity building in urban management; greater
financial responsibility at the local government level; financially responsible behavior on the part of water
enterprises; and O&M.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Bali Province initiated the GOI request for BUIP at the time of the mid-term review of EJBUDP. The Minister of Public
Works and the Governor of Bali Province have endorsed the main objectives of the project at various meetings with Bank
missions. Bali province completed work on preparation of the Umbrella Environmental Assessment (UEA) on an agreed
schedule. The Governor's Decree on the policy framework for land acquisition and resettlement under the project was
issued prior to Appraisal. Local governments demonstrated their ownership of the project by presenting their PJMs at a
Workshop in Bali during the joint GOI - Bank Appraisal of the project. Government agencies at all levels have also
budgeted counterpart funds for the first year of implementation.

12. Value added of Bank support:
Bank support for the project will add value both at provincial and national levels by addressing the sectoral issues
identified in the CAS (see Block 2, 15). GOI believes that the Bank, with its urban development experience across
developing countries and its catalytic role in mobilizing support from other donors as well as private sector, is best suited
to build on the achievements of the first IUIDP project in Indonesia (EJBUDP) through this follow-up project in Bali,
which is the first of a new generation of projects in Indonesia that will be tailored to the specific future developmental
needs of individual islands/provinces.

(see Annex 4):
*  All sub-projects were evaluated by either cost-benefit analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis, as discussed in Annex
4. Sub-projects for which cost-benefit analyses were carried out yield a weighted (by investment cost) average return
of 18.1%. Overall, the project is economically viable and sensitivity analyses show that the returns are robust.
*  In the case of water supply, financial and/or economic analyses were carried out for all proposed water supply
investments (grouped into about 16 sub-projects). (Investments to be made by the private sector were not analyzed
but are expected to yield acceptable returns.) Sub-projects went through several rounds of redesign as a result of
financial and economic evaluation and investment scales were reduced (e.g., Tabanan investments went down from
Rp.21 billion to Rp. 18 billion). Financial rates of return of the selected sub-projects are above 10%, with a weighted
average of 17.2%. In the case of urban roads and traffic management, detailed economic analyses were carried

Country: Indonesia                                                              Project Title: Bali Urban Infrastructure Project
out for road sub-projects with investment costs above Rp.500 million (about $215,000), which total about 65 sub-
projects and account for about 53% of the total urban road investments. Many sub-projects were rejected from the
original list (e.g., only eight sub-projects were selected from a list of 37 major road widening sub-projects). Rates of
return of the selected sub-projects are all above the 10% threshold; the overall weighted rate of return is estimated at
18.8%. In drainage and flood control, detailed economic analyses were carried out for those sub-projects with
investment costs above Rp.500 million (a total of nine major sub-projects, representing about 17% of the total
drainage investments). Of them, three were excluded after economic evaluation. Rates of return of the selected sub-
projects are estimated at 15.9%.
. In the case of solid waste management, the selection of landfill sites and selection of operating technologies for three
sub-projects with investments above Rp.500 million were reviewed on the least-cost basis. Investments in other
sectors, such as human waste and sanitation, Kampung Improvement Program (KIP), and Market Infrastructure
Improvement Program (MIIP), are small and quantitative economic analysis has not been carried out.
Fiscal Impact
The overall burden on government finances as a result of the project (see cover sheet) is limited: funding requirements
for the provincial and local governments represent about 5% and 15% of their respective total revenues, and about 20%
of the revenues of the PDAMs. Debt service impacts on local governments and water enterprises are within acceptable
limits. Implementation of BUIP would increase urban productivity and sustain tourism growth; government subsidies
towards PDAMs and other sectors such as solid waste management would be reduced (see section 14, Water Enterprises
Finance, and Annex 2, Private Sector Participation); and management of local revenues would be strengthened (see
section 14, Local Government Finance). The net fiscal impact of these improvements is expected to substantially
outweigh project investments.

14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5):
* Project Cost: Block 1, section 2, and Annexes 2 and 3 show the details of project cost. Urban roads and water
supply are the two largest infrastructure sub-sectors, accounting for 30% and 24% of project cost respectively.
Estimated incremental O&M expenditure accounts for $27.3 million of project cost. Agreement was reached
during Negotiations on the O&M expenditure budgets of local governments and participating PDAMs for 1997-98,
procedures for finalizing O&M budgets for succeeding years, and monitoring O&M expenditures.
* Financing Plan: The project financing plan is shown on the cover sheet. The proposed Bank Loan of $110.0 million
will provide 32.9% of the total estimated financing requirement of $334.7 million. The balance is from GOI ($162.0
million, see section 13, Fiscal Impact), the private sector ($55.6 million), other foreign funding ($6.7 million), and
community contribution ($0.4 million).
* On-Lending: An estimated $21.0 million (19 percent) of the total Bank Loan will be on-lent by the central
government to local governments ($9.5 million) and participating PDAMs ($11.5 million) under Subsidiary Loan
Agreements (SLA). Interest on SLAs is the same as the interest on GOI loans to local governments and their
enterprises through the Regional Development Account (RDA) mechanism, and is a positive real rate. GOI has
agreed to review the interest rate policy and move towards market rates; the Bank will also engage in a dialogue with
GOI on this subject in the context of .he discussions of the water sector paper, currently being prepared.
Confirmation was obtained from GOI at Negotiations on SLA loan terms, and standard pro-forma SLAs for local
governments and water enterprises respectively. Bank approval of the SLAfor each participating local government
and PDAM is a condition of disbursement to that local government/PDAM
Local Government Finance
* Local Revenues Improvement: Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs) prepared by each local government for
the BUIP period embody targets which represent a median real term growth of about 12 percent annually over the
period 1996/97 to 2001/02 and are much higher than the median forecast real growth of regional domestic product of
about 6 percent per annum. These RIAPs would require revision after the expected passage of the new national
legislation on local taxes and charges (which is currently before the legislature).
* Local Government Borrowing: Five of the participating local governments now have significant borrowing capacity
which, in line with general GOI policy, they will utilize to finance part of their investment programs through SLA

sub-loans under BUIP. GOI confirmed the borrowing commitments of local governments at Negotiations.
Kotamadya Denpasar will not borrow under the Project, since nearly all its estimated borrowing capacity is proposed
to be committed to financing the separate Denpasar sewerage scheme.
Water Enterprises Finance
Each participating PDAM furnished at Negotiations a financial recovery action plan (FRAP), designed to achieve full
cost recovery as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of the BUIP period. The FRAPs detail the size and timing
of tariff increases, and program practical and effective steps to improve operational efficiency. GOI confirmed at
Negotiations that: (i) Bank funds will be provided to the PDAMs wholly as loans through SLAs; (ii) neither BUIP loan
funds nor other GOI funds will finance connections, except those of domestic consumers to whom installment credit is
extended; (iii) grace period for loan repayment will be limited to the construction period, and interest will be required to
be paid during construction; (iv) PDAMs will be required to finance investments from internal generation, where
feasible; and (v) central government equity financing (through budgetary grants) will be reduced from 60% of overall
investment program to no more than 40%, and will be targeted to the poorer section of the population.
Financial Management and Controls
Although flow of funds to project implementing agencies is necessarily complex due to existing GOI policies and
procedures, central agencies, as well as provincial and local government agencies in Bali, are familiar with these
processes. Capacity for financial accounting and financial management for the project at provincial and local levels,
established under EJBUDP, is still weak, and requires technical assistance support.
Bali agencies demonstrated their capacity to meet Bank audit requirements (both for Project Accounts and for PDAMs)
during EJBUDP and they are expected to be able to do so for this project as well. There is adequate audit capacity in
Indonesia to carry out audits meeting Bank requirements.
15. Technical Assessment:
The project is made up of a large number of sub-projects, mainly in roads, water supply, drainage, and solid waste
management, the majority of which are fairly small and are not technically complex. GOI and the Bank have agreed
upon technical criteria for sub-projects in the various sub-sectors that had been used in recent IU(I)DP projects; these
have been updated and are now being adopted in BUIP as well. Special efforts have been made to ensure that the
technical criteria are also consistent with those used in Bank sector projects e.g., urban transport, in Indonesia.
Provincial and local government agencies, working closely with the preparation consultants, and with periodic reviews
and comments from Bank missions - which included an urban transport specialist, a water supply engineer, a solid waste
expert, and a municipal engineer - have prepared a technically acceptable project. Technical assistance is included in the
project for detailed engineering design and supervision support to the implementing agencies to ensure that the technical
quality of implementation will also be satisfactory. Bank supervision missions will also monitor the technical quality of
implementation carefully.

16. Institutional Assessment:
A. Executing Agency
DG Cipta Karya has executed several Bank and other donor funded projects in the urban sector and has competent staff.
It has worked closely with BAPPENAS and TKPP in providing guidance to the provincial government during various
stages of preparation. Under the proposed implementation arrangement (which is consistent with the recent government
policy announced in January 1997), DG Cipta Karya will be required to play a guiding and advising role, compared to the
more hands-on executing role in EJBUDP. DG Cipta Karya has already made this transition in the Second East Java
Urban Development Project (Loan 4017 - IND).

B. Project Management
Bali province participated in the implementation of EJBUDP, and thus has some experience in implementing a Bank
urban project. It has also taken the lead in the preparation of BUIP and has performed satisfactorily. As indicated in
Block 1, section 4, the PPCU will be responsible for overall project management, and will receive technical assistance.
Nevertheless, because of the province's lack of experience in playing the lead role in project implementation, lack of
familiarity with current Bank procedures (especially relating to environment, resettlement, etc.), and because of the
limited number of senior staff with project management experience at the provincial level, special attention will need to
be paid to project management by GOI and Bank supervision missions.
~~~~~~~~~.......................... ..................................................I.................................................. ..............................  ..................................... ...................................
17. Social Assessment:
All key stake holders were consulted extensively during project preparation. (See Block 3, section 19). In order to
mitigate possible adverse impact of development in general, and infrastructure in particular, on Bali's unique cultural
heritage, the project includes a component to promote sound conservation and management of cultural heritage assets.
Annex 2 provides additional details on the elements of this component.

18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category       [X] A        [ ]   B      [ ]   C
* Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan. The Environmental Assessment (EA) prepared for BUIP is a
regional/sectoral EA in Bank terms, but it is being called Umbrella Environmental Assessment (UEA) to avoid
confusion with regional EA as defined in GOI regulations. The UEA report includes: an Environmental Profile of
Bali; a system of environmental zoning for Bali; sub-project screening criteria and procedures; generic EA TOR and
mitigation and monitoring procedures for sub-projects; and recommendations for training and institutional
strengthening. The environmental management and monitoring procedures and arrangements presented in the UEA,
modified and supplemented based on Bank mission comments, are consolidated in the BUIP Environmental
Management and Monitoring Plan (EMMP). The EMMP also includes a follow-on Study on Cumulative
Environmental Impacts that will be conducted during project implementation to address the broader issues of the
environmental impact of tourism-related and other economic development. GOI confirmed at Negotiations that the
EMMP will be implemented.
* Sub-project Screening and Environmental Management. BUIP sub-project screening procedures blend Bank and
GOI criteria. Local governments will screen sub-projects in their investment programs and the results will be
reviewed by Bapedalda Bali. The proponent of each sub-project will ensure completion of the required
environmental instruments and may not proceed to implementation until they have been approved by the cognizant
government authority and, where appropriate, the Bank. The Bank will review all ANDALs (full EAs), all
UKLs/UPLs (environmental management and monitoring plans) for solid waste sub-projects, and a representative
sample of other UKLs/UPLs. Training will be provided to strengthen capacity of project managers (PIMPROs) and
other staff to supervise implementation of environmental management and monitoring activities.
* Consultations and Disclosure. All consultation and disclosure requirements of OD 4.01 and BP 17.50 have been met.
The Executive Summary of the UEA was sent to the Executive Directors on December 10, 1996 and a copy of the
full UEA has been placed in the Bank's Public Information Center (PIC).
* Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Involuntary resettlement will be avoided (where feasible) or minimized through
appropriate design of sub-projects. As BUIP is being implemented on a programmatic basis, a policy framework for
land acquisition and resettlement of project affected persons, consistent with OD 4.30, has been agreed between GOI
and the Bank and a Governor's Decree has been issued on this subject.
Bali province has identified sub-projects that are likely to require land acquisition and resettlement. Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared, as part of the APIPs, for all sub-projects to be implemented in the upcoming
fiscal year. APIPs will also indicate the agencies responsible for implementation of individual RAPs. Counterpart
funding requirements and sources of funds - central, provincial, and local, will be identified. Loan funds may be used
for infrastructure improvements in resettlement sites. Implementation of the approved RAPs is a condition for
disbursement for the relevant sub-projects.

Bali province has confirmed that for all cases of land acquisition and/or resettlement that may have taken place after
January 1, 1996 but prior to the issuance of the SK Gubernur, an evaluation will be conducted independently, on
terms of reference agreed by GOI and the Bank, to determine if any additional compensation is payable to the
affected persons in light of the provisions of the SK Gubernur as applied to such cases. These sub-projects may only
be implemented after any additional compensation payable to the affected persons is paid in full.

Consultation and Collaboration
During preparation, the urban community in Bali was consulted extensively at the provincial level, the district level and
the urban center level. These included representatives of government agencies, academics, NGOs, youth and women's
organizations, private business community, farmers, banjars (neighborhood organizations), teachers, etc. A real demand
survey was also carried out. A local (female) consultant was engaged by the Bank to carry out further consultations with
women. The findings of the consultations will be factored into the final selection of sub-projects, design, and
implementation. During BUIP implementation, the key stake holders - beneficiaries, community groups, academic
institutions, NGOs, women's groups, etc., besides relevant government agencies at all levels - will be consulted on an on-
going basis at district and urban center levels. Extensive collaboration is also envisaged with these stake holders.
Technical assistance is being provided under the project to facilitate such consultation and collaboration.

20. Sustainability:
The benefits of the project are expected to be sustainable, especially in areas such as: medium-term planning,
programming, budgeting, and implementation of urban infrastructure projects at provincial and local government levels;
more efficient service delivery in the water supply sector; and heightened environmental awareness and management
capability. The cultural heritage component is expected to have a demonstration effect and will contribute to
strengthening current government efforts in this area.
The major risk is the limited capacity of the provincial and local government institutions to address the various issues
under the project, especially in the context of decentralized implementation. The risk mitigating measures are
summarized in Block 3, 21 below.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
There are concerns about the impact on Bali's environment as a result of the rapid growth in tourism. The project could
be construed as contributing to an increase in tourism and consequent worsening of environmental conditions. The
EMMP, which will safeguard against possible negative environmental impacts of BUIP investments and, through the
Cumulative Environmental Impacts Study, will also address environmental impacts of all development in Bali, should
address these concerns. During project implementation, the Bank Project Team will maintain an effective dialogue with
the province on the need to examine all investments in Bali (including those in sectors not covered by the project) from
economic, technical, financial, and environmental considerations.
Block 4: Main Loan Conditions

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$250.5 million
Urban Infrastructure Investments. This component includes investments in the following urban infrastructure sub-
sectors: urban roads and traffic management; water supply; drainage and flood control; solid waste management;
sanitation; KIP and MIIP; market development; terminals and parking areas; incremental O&M; and engineering design
and construction supervision.
Urban Roads and Traffic Management. The project provides for a program of road development, improvement,
rehabilitation, and overlays of about 1,200 km of roads in the nine Bali local government jurisdictions. Major sub-
projects include: corridor management of the Northern Ring Road in Denpasar; development of the Western Ring Road
in Denpasar; extension of Jalan Hayam Waruk to the Sanur bypass; and the Gianyar bypass. Traffic management works
are planned mainly on a programmatic basis in Denpasar, Badung, Jembrana, and Buleleng; about ten sub-projects for
identified junction improvements will be implemented in the first two years. ANDALs will be required for some of the
roads sub-projects, as also land acquisition and resettlement; appropriate steps will be taken as per EMMP guidelines and
the framework for land acquisition and resettlement.
Water Supply. Investment programs in the four participating PDAMs are mostly for extension of secondary and tertiary
distribution networks, as well as for rehabilitation of production facilities. Altogether, water supply sub-projects
included in the proposed project and financed under SLAs include an additional 29,000 connections and 620 km of
distribution pipe. A significant portion of the project cost for water supply is for private sector in .estment, especially in
South Bali.
Drainage and Flood Control. The drainage and flood control program covers 25 towns, with a significant portion in
Denpasar, and has been prepared using existing Master Plans and Outline Plans wherever available. The program
consists of construction, widening and rehabilitation of a total of about 360 km of drains. Land acquisition is expected to
be minimal as no new primary or secondary drains are being constructed.
Solid Waste Management. Solid waste activities cover two broad areas: (i) physical equipment and final disposal site
(TPA) improvements; and (ii) "software". The physical element includes improvements to TPAs totaling 37 ha, 12
composting facilities, and about 70 collection trucks and containers. The software side includes an urban environmental
campaign, pilot education at banjars (for community composting), and composting activities at schools. A PSP study
will be carried out in the first year of the project for operation of the TPAs, especially in South Bali, and for commercial
waste collection. Land acquisition will be required for the TPAs, but much of the land is already government owned.
All EAs for solid waste investments will be reviewed by the Bank.
Sanitation. A major $60 million OECF sewerage project has recently been approved and will provide sewerage service
in Denpasar, Kuta, and Sanur. BUIP investments in sanitation are therefore modest and will be limited to construction of
sludge treatment plants in Bangli, Gianyar, and Karangasem, and purchase of a few sludge trucks. The feasibility of
contracting out the management and operation of the sludge treatment plants and private sector purchase (and operation)
of sludge trucks will be examined during implementation.
KIP. KIP will cover 580 ha of kampung and will provide infrastructure to low income and dense areas of the towns.
KIP will be funded by GOI, mostly by local governments, with no loan funding.

Markets. This sub-component has been included on a programmatic basis. Feasibility studies for two new markets in
Denpasar and improvement of an existing traditional market in Tabanan will be reviewed prior to implementation. PSP
will be a high priority.
Operations and Maintenance. In order to improve the current poor level of operations and maintenance, the project
will support incremental O&M for existing infrastructure as well as for new infrastructure. Actual increments required
have been computed on the basis of O&M consulting work done under EJBUDP. Technical assistance will also be
provided under the project for improving O&M, especially for roads and drainage.
Detailed Engineering Design and Construction Supervision. Technical assistance will be provided out of the
proceeds of a Japan Grant for detailed engineering design and construction supervision (DED&S) of first year sub-
projects. Technical assistance for DED&S for sub-projects in years 2-5 will be packaged into three TA contracts: (i) for
roads; (ii) for water supply; and (iii) for other infrastructure.
Project Component 2 - US$2.0 million from the Bank's TAP4I Project.
Private Sector Participation. The objective of this component is to involve the private sector in the provision of urban
infrastructure services. Technical assistance, estimated at $2.0 million and funded out of the Bank's TAP4I Project, will
be provided for facilitating PSP in water supply and solid waste in Bali, especially in South Bali. (TA for PSP in water
supply will include an investment program for the entire island of Bali, beyond the project period; an analysis of
institutional options for water supply in the island; and an analysis of PSP options. In the case of solid waste, the focus
will be on PSP options.) The project financing plan includes an estimated figure of about $50 million towards water
supply investments in South Bali. Private sector participation is also envisaged in new markets and terminals, specially
in South Bali, and will be considered for sludge removal contracts and possible contract management of sludge treatment
plants.
Project Component 3 - US$10.4 million.
Cultural Heritage Conservation. This component has been included on the basis of preliminary preparatory work and
could consist of five elements: (a) improvements to the Besakih complex neighborhood; (b) pilot conservation activities;
(c) establishment of a historic places inventory; (d) strengthening conservation capacities; and (e) signage in Indonesian
and in other languages at heritage sites. A Workshop is planned in Bali at the time of project launch to finalize the
elements of the component and secure bilateral donor funding and private sector support for part financing the
component.
Project Component 4 - US$15.1 million
Technical Assistance and Training. The attached table indicates technical assistance to be provided under the project
(The table includes $4.1 million for DED&S which is now included under Component 1. The table does not include $1.0
million for Greater Denpasar Structural Planning which is to be financed by ADB). Technical assistance covers four
broad categories: (i) Project Management Advisory Services; (ii) Institutional Development; (iii) Training; and (iv)
Studies. TA has been classified into two priority categories: (i) Priority I (Advisory support to PPCU, PSP Study for
Water Supply, PSP Study for Solid Waste, Training on Environmental Management, Community Consultation, DED&S
of First Year Sub-projects), for which final draft TOR and short list of consulting firms will be submitted to the Bank by
April 30, 1997; (ii) Priority II, for which final draft TOR and short list of consulting firms will be submitted to the Bank
by October 1997. Agreement was reached during Negotiations on technical assistance listed in the TA table, including
time table for various related activities, e.g., finalization of TOR and short lists, mobilization of consultants, and
completion; procedures for consultation with the Bank on the recommendations of the various studies and plans for
implementation; and implementation of training programs.

Analysis (see Economic Studies and Aide Memoires in the ProJect File):
Water Supply. The main benefits of water supply sub-projects are increased availability of clean, piped water at
reduced total cost. Demand surveys of potential piped water users were conducted in all service areas and
demand forecasts were made based on the surveys and on PDAMs' previous years' connection rates. A financial
analysis was first carried out for each proposed water supply sub-project. The analysis used a financial model
called FINPRO, which was developed by the Bank for water supply projects in Indonesia. Demand forecasts
were adjusted according to estimated income and price elasticities. For PDAMs where the tariff increases
required to comply with the financial covenants of EJBUDP were above the normal inflation rates, additional
scenarios, with tariff increases kept at inflation rates, were further examined. If the estimated financial rate of
return was above 10% in both cases, the sub-project was acceptable, and no economic analysis was required
(because the financial return is considered a lower bound to the economic return); otherwise, an economic
analysis was carried out. The economic analysis used a model named ECOWAT, also developed by the Bank for
analyzing water supply projects in Indonesia. A sub-project was acceptable if the estimated economic internal
rate of return (EIRR) was above 10%.
Urban Roads. The project consists of hundreds of urban road sub-projects in over 50 towns. Some of them are
very small investments. It is therefore necessary to develop a structured approach to economic analysis. Sub-
projects are classified according to their costs: a sub-project is small if the investment is less than Rp. 500

million (about $215,000 in 1996 price); others are large. Large sub-projects are subject to full economic
feasibility analysis. Small sub-projects are mostly resurfacing of roads (see second part of Annex 4). The
benefits of road sub-projects (widening and rehabilitation) are savings in vehicle operating costs and savings
from decreased travel time due to reduced congestion and improved road condition. A speed change model and a
road surface roughness model were used to estimate economic returns. The speed change model is based on the
Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual, Part I, Urban Roads, which was prepared under technical assistance from
the World Bank Regional Cities Urban Transport Project (Loan 2817 - IND, 1987). The road surface roughness
change model is based on the World Bank's HDM-III model. A road sub-project was acceptable if the estimated
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was above 10%.
Drainage/Flood Control. Similar to the urban roads, drainage sub-projects are also classified according to their
costs; a sub-project is small if the investment is less than Rp.500 million and large otherwise. Large sub-projects
are subject to full economic feasibility analysis. Small sub-projects are mostly dredging flood drains (see second
part of Annex 4). The main benefits are reduced flood-caused damage to household property, reduced road
maintenance, reduced traffic disruption, increased land values, and improved health, especially of poor people
residing in low lying and flood prone areas. Because the benefits are difficult to quantify, the expected land
value increases due to reduced flooding were used as a proxy for the benefits. They were estimated based on
land values obtained from surveys in similar but less frequently flooded neighborhoods. Economic rates of
return were estimated on the basis of the expected land value increases. A sub-project was acceptable if its
return was above 10%.
Terminals. The development of bus terminals is expected to affect traffic use on roads in the city. The benefits
are reduced overall travel time and reduced road congestion levels. Sub-projects with costs greater than Rp.500
million are required to carry out a financial analysis to examine if incremental revenues can cover investment
costs. If revenues do not cover costs, an economic analysis is required where the savings in road user costs are
estimated and compared with project costs. A sub-project is acceptable if the rate of return was at least 10%.
Investments for terminals will be analyzed during project implementation, once the feasibility studies are
completed.
Assumptions on Economic Costs:
Market prices in Indonesia, particularly for tradable goods, exchange rates and labor, provide a reasonably good
approximation to the opportunity costs. Therefore it has not been necessary to restate market prices in terms of
their economic equivalents. The value of time was assumed to be 30% of average wage for leisure and 100% of
average wage for work, taking into account the Bank recommendation based on a review of recent research.
Investment costs include 10% physical contingencies and 8% detailed engineering design, supervision and
technical assistance, and exclude taxes and duties. With market lending rates for working capital at 18% plus
and inflation between 8-9% per year, the opportunity cost of capital was assumed at 10%.
Sensitivity Analysis:
Quantitative sensitivity analyses were carried out as part of the economic/financial analyses for sub-projects in
water supply, urban roads, and drainage sectors. The results are reported in the Economic Studies in the Project
File. Specifically, for urban road widening sub-projects, scenarios considered include combinations of zero
traffic growth, double traffic growth, time savings included and time savings not included. For water supply sub-
projects, scenarios with varying tariff increases, amount of daily water consumption, value of time, and amount
of bottled water purchase were examined. In particular, if the financial rate of return was less than 10% with
tariff increases at inflation rates, an economic analysis was carried out for the sub-project. For drainage sub-
projects, sensitivity scenarios consist of increasing investment costs by 20% and delaying implementation by
three years. Special attention was given to those sub-projects whose rates of returns were close to the cut-off rate
of 10%. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the returns of the selected sub-projects are robust.

Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
For Small Urban Road and Drainage Sub-projects and All Investments in other Sub-sectors
Cost-Effectiveness Indicators
Unit costs, standards, and criteria for project planning as well as the designs were derived from the Ministry of
Public Works guidelines and modified to suit Bali conditions and similar previous projects. They have been
reviewed and accepted by the Bank and summarized in the agreed Technical Memoranda for various sub-sectors
(Details are in the project file).
Analysis:
Urban Roads. The small urban road sub-projects are based on planning and design criteria (e.g., traffic counts
and road conditions) which were established on the basis of past similar urban road projects and have been
accepted by the Bank and used in other IU(I)DP projects. Economic returns of these sub-projects are expected to
be high as these sub-projects are mostly in the nature of deferred maintenance.
Drainage/Flood Control. The small drainage sub-projects are based on planning and design criteria (e.g.,
frequency of floods, runoff, and drain capacity) which were established on the basis of past similar drainage
projects and have been accepted by the Bank and used in other IU(I)DP projects. Economic returns of these sub-
projects are expected to be acceptable as the sub-projects are mainly in the nature of deferred maintenance.
Solid Waste. The main benefits are health and environment related, resulting from cleaner air and water.
Because they spread not only to the direct beneficiaries but also to the whole community and are difficult to
quantify, no cost-benefit analysis was required for this component. Only least cost analysis was conducted for
sub-projects with a cost of more than Rp.500 million. The designs were based on real demand and willingness to
pay surveys and the agreed technical standards, taking into account population density and least cost
technologies. Priority was given to communities with high densities.
Sanitation. Wastewater treatment facilities will generate health benefits as a result of reduced ground water
contamination. These benefits are not easy to quantify and accrue to communities as a whole rather than to the
direct recipients of these services, and therefore, no quantitative cost-benefit analysis was required. Planning and
design was based on agreed technical standards, taking into account population density, ground water table level,
and least cost alternatives.
Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) and Market Infrastructure Improvement Program (MIIP). As
the impact evaluation conducted by OED demonstrated (OED report 14747-IND, 1995), KIP has very positive
impact on the living conditions of kampung residents in terms of road access, water supply facilities, drainage,
garbage collection, and sanitation. KIP has also been replicated throughout Indonesia without Bank financing.
MIIP investments are also very much needed; their costs are covered by municipal fees from vendors, who
participate in deciding the kinds of improvements. Because of the difficulties in quantifying KIP and MIIP
benefits, cost-benefit analysis was not a requirement for this component as long as sub-project designs follow
agreed technical standards.
Market Development. This component is similar to the MIIP component and is subject to agreed technical
standards and costs are recovered by fees from participating vendors. No cost-benefit analysis was required for
this component.

Terminals. Sub-projects with investment costs below Rp.500 million were required to comply with technical
standards (derived from the technical guidelines of the Ministrv of Communications). Larger sub-projects must,
in addition to satisfying the technical standards, demonstrate that revenues cover investment costs (see first part
of Annex 4).
Cultural Heritage Conservation. The major benefits of this component are iilproved preservation of built
heritage and landscapes. These benefits are intangible and difficult to quantit\K. Theretore no cost-benefit
analysis was required. The design and cost estimates are subject to review by the Bank and initernational experts.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of works and goods will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits",
dated January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996. Standard Bidding Documents will be used for all Bank
financed procurement. Table B indicates the threshold values for ICB, NCB, and national shopping, as also prior review
thresholds; these are identical to those agreed with GOI in urban development projects approved in 1996.
Table A indicates the proposed procurement packaging. Procurement packaging has sought to balance the province's
desire to keep contract packages small to enable small local contractors to bid for work and GOI/Bank desire for
efficiency and cost effectiveness in procurement through optimal packaging. It is further complicated by the nature of
the project, which consists of a large number of small sub-projects, spread over a number of sectors, urban centers, and
implementing agencies. As a result, only 13 ICB packages are expected, with a loan value of $13.6 million, out of a total
of about 330 packages for civil works and goods procurement. The Bank Project Team will carefully review APIPs to
ensure optimal packaging of contracts during each year of implementation. Civil works contracts financed under the
loan, up to an aggregate loan value of $70.5 million, and goods contracts financed under the loan, up to an aggregate loan
value of $8.1 million, will be procured under NCB procedures. Prior review by the Bank is expected to cover
approximately 50% of the total value of contracts financed from the Bank loan. This will be complemented by
systematic post review by Bank staff of 5% of the contracts.
Procurement of consulting services and the format for consultants' contracts will follow the "Guidelines for Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated August 1981.
PPCU Advisory Consultants will coordinate the provision of procurement training to project staff, using the services of
various DED&S consultants. RSI staff of the Portfolio Management and Implementation Support Unit will provide on-
going advice, guidance and support to project agencies on all NCB procurement. ICB procurements will be handled at
Headquarters in Washington. The APIP will include a Procurement Plan for procurement activities relating to project
implementation in each GOI fiscal year; it will show timelines for each contract or procurement activity, and grouping of
packages. A Preliminary Procurement Plan for the first year of implementation is available in project files.
Disbursement
Table C shows the allocation of loan proceeds by category and the disbursement percentages proposed in each category.
Consistent with departmental practice, some local expenditures are financed from Bank loan proceeds. The table below
shows the estimated disbursements from the IBRD loan, by IBRD fiscal year.

Cumulative                  8.4  20.9  47.1  79.8  98.2   110.0
Special account:
In order to facilitate loan disbursements, GOI will establish a Special Account in Bank Indonesia, to be maintained in US
Dollars, with an initial deposit of $6.4 million (equivalent to four months average project disbursements), which will also
be the authorized ceiling for the account. The account will be managed by the Directorate General of Budget, Ministry

of Finance. Replenishment of the account will be made on a monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the authorized ceiling
has been disbursed, whichever is earlier. All disbursements to contractors from the Special Account (except for centrally
managed technical assistance contracts) will be made through KPKN Treasury Offices at the sub-provincial level.
Documentation. Disbursements from the loan for the following types of contracts require full documentation: (i) civil
works contracts valued at $1 million (or equivalent) or more; (ii) goods contracts valued at $200,000 (or equivalent) or
more; (iii) consulting contracts with firms, valued at $100,000 (or equivalent) or more; and (iv) consulting contracts with
individuals, valued at $50,000 (or equivalent) or more. All other disbursements will be made against statements of
expenditure (SOE), for which full supporting documentation will be retained by the Directorate General of Budget and
the implementing agencies, and made available to the Bank on request.
