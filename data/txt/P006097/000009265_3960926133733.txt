MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT-
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
'TO' THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN-
TO BELIZE
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND IEXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Belize for US$7.8 million equivalant is submitted for approval.  The proposed
loan, which would be repayable in 17 yeais, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate, would help to finance an
agricultural credit and export development project.  US$0.7 million
equivalent of technical assistance would be cofinanced on a grant basis by
-,the Japanese Government tfirough the Japanese Grant Facility, the United
Kingdom Overseas Development Adiinistration and the FAO.
2.        Background.  Belize's economy expanded steadily during the 1960s
and most of the 19708, and GDP grew by 4.5-5.0% p.a. The agricultural
sector, which at present accounts for about 20% of GDP, 81J of merchandise
export earnings, and 38%of the labor force, was an imtportant contributor to
these growth rates, primarily through the expansion of the sugar industry and
the revitalization of the banana industry.  However, economic growth declined
sharply during the 1980s, mainly because of the steady deterioration in the
terms of international trade. Belize was particularly affected by falling
sugar prices (sugpr accounted for 54% of export value in 1981).
3.     -' To restimulate economic growth, the Government attaches high
priority to diversifying away from sugar production, and especially expanding
the private sector production of export crops with good market prospects,
such as bananas, citrus, cocoa and shrimp. The preemine*it characteristics of
Belize, i.e., the large underdeveloped agricultural land resource (only 15%
of the 2.4 million acres with potential for agriculture are presently under
production), its open and largely distortion-free economy, its proximity to
North American markets and its special commercial r*lationship with the UK,
provide good opportunities for development of export-oriented agriculture.
Key public sector institutions in the- agricultural sector are the Ministries
of Agriculture (MA) and Natural Resources (MNR), the Banana Cont2 ol Board
(BCB), and the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Belize's development
bank. The Government, however, relies heavily on the private sector,
including growers' associations, to expand agricultural production and
exports.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project, the Bank's
first assistance for agriculture in Belize, supports the Bank's objectives of
helping Belize realize its export growth potential and of strengthening key
developmental institutions. The Bank's involvement would help assure that
the project addresses in particular: (a) inadequacies in the institutional
arrangements for providing agricultural credit, including inefficiencies in
the credit services, liquidity problems of the DFC, limited participation of
private Banks in lending for- the sector, and lack of term credit; and
(b) weaknesses in the institutional capacity of private and public sector
institutions such as exist in some growers' associations, the Banana Control



Board (BCB) and the Ministries of Agriculture (MA) and Natural Resources
( AR).
*. 5.     Project Objectives.  The ob1ectives of the proposed project would
be to: (a)texpand'agricuitural exports as a means to improve the country's
balance of payments while ,reducing.the dependence on sugar; (b) strengthen
Bellze's agricultural- financial system as a means to stimulate private sector
investment in agriculture, and (c) further Improve the policy environment for
private investment in agricultural export activities.
6.        Project Description,-- The- proposed- pro.iect would: (a) provide a;.
line of credit through a rediscount facility, the Belize Credit Facility
(BCF), managed by the Central.Bank (CBB), to finance agricultural export crop
production-, principally bananas, cocoa, citrus and cultured shrimp through
private and public banking institutions (82% of project-costs); (b) finance
an extensive institutional strengthening program for the DFC, MA, MNR and BCB
which-would comprise (i)'long-term consultants for credit-related matters for
BCF and DFC anu for cocoa and shrimp,production technology for MA, and (ii)
on-the-job and external training for staff of DFC and MA, The project, to be
carried out over five years, provides funds for credit, consultants,
training, vehicles, equipment, and incremental operating costs. The Ministry
of Economic Development (MED) will be responsible for coordinating the
activities of-ttae various implementing agencies. The small cocoa component
will not affect international markets ,ecause of its size (1,000 acres>,  The
total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.3 million equivalent, witb a
foreign exchange component of US$7.1 million (58%).  jThe Bank would finance
US$7.8 million or 64% of total project costs.  A brei&down of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, together with the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B.  A timetable of key project processing events and the status of   *
Bank Group operations in Belize are given in Schedule$ C and D respectively.
A map is attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7011-BEL dated May 20,
1988, is also attached.
7.        Areed Actions.  The Borrower agreed to:  (a) an action plan for
DFC comprising (i) annual targets to eliminate all arrears 12 months and over
by 1992, (ii) annual collection ratios, (iii) recovery of each loan in
arrears of over US$25,000 equivalent outstanding in accordance with a~
schedule to be provided by February 15, 1989, (iv) hiring of key consultants
by December 31, 1988, (v) introducing a loan risk classification system by
September 30, 1989, and (vi) limiting DPC's on-lending under the project to
no more than one third of the funds to be made available by the Bank for
credit unless otherwise agreed by the Bank; (b) remove the export licensing
requirements-for citrus and exempt land-based shrimp production from the 5%
export tax by December 31, 1988; (c) set BCF's on-lending rate equal to the
Bank's lending rate plus a 1% fee for the Borrower's assumption of foreign
exchange risk, with rates to final borrowers to be maintained at market
rates; these rates to be reviewed by the Bank'not later than December 31 of
each year; (d) obtain Bank's prior approval for subloan proposals in excess
of US$300,000 equivalent, for any sugar subloan, and for the first ten
subloans approved by BCP, regardless of their size, and (e) authorize CBB's
Loan Supervisory Department to submit by the close of each fiscal year,
evaluation reports on the quality of lending operations and the status of

1.ending portfolio unde~r the project for Fls participating in the BCF.  As
,~nditions of loan effective'iess, the BorrQwar al'so. ag(eed td6- (a) ciuise CBB
add DFC to sign a participation agreement; (b) sign cofinancing'arrangements
or provide-~other satisfactory arrangements-with the Japanese Gove:nmei , the
United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration and the FAO; (c) es'tablish
aProject Accounts (d)-formaly-approve  CF'sStatement-of Policies '
operating Regulations and Leniding Procedures; and (e) sign a Subsidiary,
Agreement with CBB.  As condition of disbursement to Fls (other than DFC),
the Borrower agreed to cause CBB to sign participation-agreements with each
Fl.  As a condition of disbursement for BCB funids, the Borrower agreed to
aigni a'Subsid'iar'AgreementwidthB78BB
8.        Benefits.  The main benefits of the projectwould be of three
types.  First,the'project would diversify and expand Belizels exports, and
improve the balance of payments through incre'ased foreign -exchange'earnings.
By diversifying export.crop produ;-tion, the project would also help to reduce
shocks to the economy caused by mArket swings and changes in international
commodity prices.  Second, the projet would encourag Fwider participationn    o
the banking sector ain financial intermediation for agricultural development,
and strengthen DFC in its role of"financial intermediaction.  1arird, the
project would further enhance the business environmeJat ian Belize through
strenatheniRg the financial system eand eliWnating some. trade and tax
restrictions, thereby helping to attract them'eritate inveatmeis t needed to'
dtevelop Belize's agricultural export potential. Theln aredit component would
have directly quantifiable benefits consisting of-increased production of-
bananas, citrus, cocoa and shrimp; the internal economic rate ofareturn would
be 28%. 
9.        Risks. -The main risks for the project revolve around market
factors, e'specially for bananas, which Belize currently sells to the UK at a
preferential price., -HoweVer, even at wopld market prices, banana proruction
is financially and economically viable.  The project-is flenible in-design to
accommodate shifts in market conditions and development ofnew agriculturaltn
export market opportunities.  Theimain risks relating to projece
implementation concern  the capacity of DFC to implement the institutionA,
reforms needed to improve the quality of its loan. portfolio anld its
liquidity,,and the possibility of limited participation by other financial
intermediaries (tIe) in providing  "term lending.  The establishment of the
rediscounting facility, technical assistance and the introduction of improved
bankang procedures have all been designed to improve DFC's operations and to
encourage participation by- other FI.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed louanwould comply
with the Articles ofoAgrbeement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve t-He proposed loan.
