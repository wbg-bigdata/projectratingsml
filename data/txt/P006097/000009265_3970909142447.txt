AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Ln 2959-BEL
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural Credit
and Export Promotion Project in Belize, for which Loan 2959-BEL in the amount of
US$7.8 million equivalent was approved on June 15, 1988 and made effective on April 7,
1989.
After two one-year extensions, the loan was closed on December 31, 1996. Final
disbursement took place on February 27, 1997; the balance of US$1,097,003.37 was
canceled on May 28, 1997.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Daniel Moreau, Task Manager, Natural Resources
Management and Rural Poverty Division, Latin American and the Caribbean Region and
Mrs. Anne Marie del Castillo, Economist, Consultant. The ICR was reviewed by Jonathan
Parker, Acting Division Chief, Natural Resources Management and Rural Poverty
Division and Robert Crown, Project Adviser, Country Department III. The Borrower
provided its own contribution to the report (Annex C) and its brief comments on the ICR
(Annex D).
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission, December 1996. It is based on material in the project file, and discussions with
representatives of the Borrower's staff and the beneficiaries as well as with individuals
involved in the project preparation and implementation in the private and public sectors of
Belize.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LN 2959-BEL
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.    The project was the first direct involvement by the Bank in agriculture in Belize.
It responded to a Government request to support its strategy to improve the country's
balance of payments while reducing the dependence on sugar and to realize the agriculture
export growth potential of the country by promoting private sector initiatives. In 1987 a
Bank mission reviewed and endorsed the Government's policy towards fostering the
expansion of diversified exports and stimulating private sector investment in agriculture.
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.    The project objectives were to support the Government's strategy to realize the
country's agricultural export growth potential by: (i) expanding agricultural exports
which would improve the country's balance of trade while reducing its dependence on
sugar; (ii) strengthening the Belize agricultural financial system by stimulating private
sector investment in agriculture; and (iii) improving the policy environment for private
investment in agricultural export activities. To achieve these, the project provided a loan
of US$7.8 million to finance US$7.2 million in credit, to be channeled through private
(US$4.8 million) and public (US$2.4 million) financial institutions for the agricultural
export promotion and US$0.6 million in technical assistance for institutional
strengthening.
3.    As part of the project GOB agreed to policy reforms which removed the shrimp
export tax and the citrus export licensing requirements. In addition, the GOB created
the cocoa advisory board and transferred the State's banana marketing and extension
services to growers' association twelve months ahead of the target date of December
1991. However, the credit component was poorly designed and it disbursed very
slowly. The objectives of increasing the sector's non-traditional exports through policy
reform was sound. The additional objective of improving financial intermediation to
the sector proved unrealistic under the circumstances.
B. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
4.    The project's achievement of its objectives was limited. Because of slow
disbursements, US$4.2 million, 54 percent of the credit component was canceled. While



- ii -
the project assumed that two-thirds of the credit component would be channeled through
private banks, as a result of high liquidity in the banking system and lending terms
inconsistent with normal commercial banking practices, not one private bank participated
in the project. Instead, the DFC handled all project credit finance. The project did little to
significantly increase the access of small farmers to credit. Project-financed agricultural
loans were extended primarily to medium to large farmers. Ten medium to large
borrowers alone accounted for more than 80 percent of the entire sub-loan portfolio.
Substantial capital infusions from the Central Government and better financial and
accounting practices associated with the project, helped DFC improve its financial
performance during the course of the project implementation. Nevertheless, the
institution's long term sustainability remains in doubt, as loan portfolio arrears continue to
be high.
5.    Project Performance and Sustainability. On balance, the project's investments
are likely to be sustained. The project financed economically sound subprojects which
increased agricultural exports, especially of citrus, bananas and shrimp. The DFC loan
portfolio financed by the project (excluding the component's canceled portion) had a
satisfactory weighted internal financial rate of return of 27 percent. However, it is unclear
that the project significantly contributed to moving the DFC towards a financial
self-sufficient institution. The second and more important impact, was the project's
support for the government's agricultural liberalization program. In this regard, the
project was particularly instrumental in accelerating the transfer of the public sector's
banana export marketing functions to the private sector - a measure which contributed to
dynamic growth in the banana industry.
6.    Bank Performance. The Bank's performance in project identification and
appraisal was deficient. The Bank did not adequately appraise the major factors limiting
exports, nor did it to determine the extent to which scarce credit limited export growth.
Nor did it properly assess the factors impeding private financial institutions from
participating in the credit component. Supervision was rated deficient, being often weak
and incomplete. It concentrated more on the DFC than on the reasons for private bank
nonparticipation and the project's progress in achieving its primary objectives, in particular
for expanding or diversifying agricultural exports.
7.    Borrower Performance. The Borrower's performance is judged to be highly
satisfactory in terms of sector policy reform. The GOB removed the shrimp export tax
and the citrus export licensing requirements, and it created the cocoa advisory board and
transferred the State's banana marketing and extension services to growers' association
twelve months ahead of the target date of December 1991. Central Bank acting as apex
intermediary was unable to solve the problems which discouraged private banks from
participating. DFC was never able to comply with its agreed financial performance
indicators, though it was able to improve the quality of its loan portfolio over the period.
Nevertheless, overall project management was sound, maintaining control of
administrative expenses and effective working relationships with DFC.

C. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATION AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
8.    The most significant lessons learned are as follows:
(a)   Government-owned development finance institutions are unlikely to
succeed in achieving both a social objective and financial sustainability at
the same time;
(b)   Reform and restructuring of a government-owned development finance
institution is more likely to succeed, if it is subject to the discipline of the
market;
(c)   change in macroeconomic and sector policies can have a more positive
impact than project financial investments; and
(d)   Private financial intermediaries will not actively participate, unless they
are carefully consulted on all the policies and procedures for a credit line
during its preparation, appraisal and loan negotiations.
9.    Future Operation. No specific plan has been prepared yet.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LN 2959-BEL
PART I:    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
1.    Economy. Belize's economy expanded steadily during the 1960's and most of the
1970's, with a GDP annual growth rate of 5 percent. This development resulted from the
expansion of the sugar industry, the revitalization of the banana sector and the
establishment of several import-substitution industries. Economic growth declined sharply
during the 1980's, mainly because of the deterioration in sugar prices. To stimulate
growth, GOB attached high priority to its policy objectives of diversifying away from
sugar production and especially expanding the production of export crops, such as
bananas, and citrus, cocoa and shrimp.
2.    Private Financial Sector. The private banking system, which provided
60 percent of domestic credit, consisted of five commercial banks with 15 branches
throughout the country. These banks provided nearly half of all agricultural lending.
Because of the volatility of the small national financial market, private banks, adverse to
long-term lending, extended relatively short-term loans (frequently extended or
rescheduled) and overdraft mechanisms for covering inventory costs and operating capital
needs. Commercial banks tended to confine their agricultural lending to one type of
agricultural activity (mainly, citrus or banana). Their agricultural clients were medium to
large farmers, agroindustries or entrepreneurs with well-established credit histories and
good collateral. Between 1986 and 1988, commercial banks experienced substantial
excess liquidity resulting from the Central Bank's relaxation of credit restrictions', high
interest rates2, and increased foreign exchange inflows. Credit to the private sector
increased substantially, growing from US$68 million in 1986 to US$120 million by 1989.
Similarly, agricultural lending grew steadily, from US$6.4 million in 1986 to
US$17.0 million in 1989. In October 1988, the GOB transferred the Central
Government's deposits from the Central Bank to private commercial banks. In 1984, the
GOB had established a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)-financed
US$5.0 million fund to provide the private banks investment credit for agricultural export
promotion. Despite the fund's extremely attractive lending terms, in four years, no more
than 58 percent of the fund, or under US$2.9 million, were disbursed. The lack of
part of the 1984 IMF Stand-by Arrangement.
2     since 1983 the Central Bank established minimum interest rates for lenders.



- 2 -
installed capacity in the private banks to evaluate non-traditional agricultural investment
proposals was one of the major reasons cited for the failure to disburse.
3.    Public Sector Financial Institution. At the time of project preparation, the
Borrower's Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was providing 10 percent of
domestic credit and half of the agricultural credit. It relied almost entirely upon
multilateral and bi-lateral donors for its funds, with foreign liabilities representing
73 percent of the DFC's assets in June 1984. By the end of 1984, DFC's portfolio,
consisting of 6,000 loans, had a total value of about US$32 million, of which 59 percent
was allocated to agriculture. Of the agricultural loans, 40 percent was for sugar cane,
10 percent for citrus, grains, fishing and livestock, 7 percent for bananas; and 13 percent
for other activities. The average loan size was US$4,200. The DFC was the only public
sector financial institution mandated to lend to small- and medium scale farmers. Despite
its mandate, farmers, especially small farmers, were reportedly displeased with the DFC.
Specific complaints referred to excessive bureaucracy, long delays in obtaining loan
approval, burdensome security requirements (especially for small farmers), and political
favoritism in obtaining new loans and enforcement of repayment conditions. By the late
eighties, the DFC was on the verge of bankruptcy. The status of the DFC portfolio was
unsatisfactory, with at least a quarter of its value in arrears. At project preparation,
expected cash flows from the portfolio would not cover DFC's needs and it was
anticipated that the institution would generate annual cash shortfalls of at least
US$1 million.
4.    Statement of Objectives. The project objectives were to support the
Government's strategy to realize the country's agricultural export growth potential by:
(i) expanding agricultural exports which would improve the country's balance of trade
while reducing its dependence on sugar; (ii) strengthening the Belize agricultural financial
system by stimulating private sector investment in agriculture; and (iii) improving the
policy environment for private investment in agricultural export activities.
5.    Macroeconomic and Sectoral objectives: The project's macroeconomic objective
was to improve the country's balance of trade position by increasing non-traditional
agricultural exports. This was an extremely important goal to Belize as its balance of
trade position had deteriorated rapidly in recent years. The project proposed to expand
exports by increasing the supply of investment capital targeted for the production of
non-traditional agricultural export sector. For Belize, the expansion of agriculture, the
sector with the most employment and export earnings, was important. In addition, there
was an urgent need to diversify agricultural production away from sugar to reduce the
economy's vulnerability to the vicissitudes of the world commodity market. At the time of
project preparation, agricultural exports represented more than 65 percent of total
exports, of which sugar exports contributed half
6.    Financial Sector Objectives. The project's aim with respect to the financial
sector, was "to increase the efficiency in the credit services and resolve the liquidity
problems of the DFC as well as increase the participation of the private banks in lending
for the sector". The financial sector objectives were to increase private sector



- 3 -
participation in the finance of non-traditional agricultural export ventures and the coverage
of financial services throughout the sector. While the private sector participation in
agriculture was significant, (about half of the sectoral total), the range of its portfolio was
very limited to its traditional clients for only a few commodities.
7.    Institutional Objectives. The project intended to address the inadequacies in the
agricultural support institutions; including providing assistance to the Banana Growers'
Association (BGA), the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for cocoa and shrimp
development, as well as to the Ministry of Natural Resource for citrus development.
This goal was sound as poor extension and marketing services were key constraints to the
development of the agricultural sector. But, relative to the size of the project's technical
assistance component (less than US$0.6 million for these purposes), the goal appears to
have been ambitious.
8.    Evaluation of Objectives. While the project objectives identified were
well-founded and reflected genuine needs of the Borrower, the project's strategy for
achieving these objectives reflect a inadequate assessment of the realities in Belize at the
time. As the project was premised on the assumption that the primary constraint to the
expansion of agricultural exports was insufficient credit, the project proposed to inject
additional credit to increase exports. The fact that the SAR stated that "the agricultural
sector generally had good access to credit", should have suggested that non-financial
constraints were inhibiting the growth and diversification of agricultural exports.
However, logistical, legal and lending requirements were severely limiting the delivery of
these services, both from private and public sources, to the small farmer segment. More
than 60 percent of this segment was not being serviced by the formal financial sector.
While the project had no explicitly stated social objective, one of the reasons for providing
support to the DFC was to increase the access of small farmers and rural entrepreneurs to
investment credit. As the DFC was the only public financial entity with the mandate for
servicing small farmers, the project proposed to support the technically insolvent DFC.
To propose a credit project at a time when banks were faced with excess liquidity would
suggest a lack of appreciation of the Borrower's circumstances. The dismal experience of
the USAID agricultural credit line (1984-1987) demonstrated clearly enough that the
private banks were not looking for more funds to finance agricultural loans. Other
measures, such as training in agricultural project appraisal, evaluation and supervision may
have been more appropriate to strengthen the private financial sector in agriculture.
9.    General Description. The principal components to be financed under the project
were:
* Part A of the Loan Agreement (LA) with a credit line for term lending for
agricultural exports principally bananas, citrus, cocoa and farmed shrimps,
through the Belize Credit Facility (BCF), managed by the Central Bank of
Belize (CBB);



- 4 -
*  Part B which included institutional development plan for the Development
Finance Corporation (DFC) to improve its financial position, especially in
regard to liquidity and cash generation; and
*  Part C with programs for institutional strengthening of the: (i) Banana
Control Board (BCB) (subsequently the Banana Growers' Association
(BGA)) for banana development; (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
(MAF) for cocoa and shrimp development, and (iii) the Ministry of Natural
Resources (MNR) for citrus development.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS
10.   Macroeconomic and Sectoral Objectives. The project achieved its
macroeconomic and sectoral objectives. By financing operations which increased
agricultural exports, especially of citrus, bananas and shrimp, the project helped to
increase and diversify agricultural exports. While sugar remained the most important
agricultural export commodity, exports of certain other agricultural commodities,
especially, bananas, grew dramatically. Between 1987 and 1994, the value of banana
exports more than doubled (see Annex C). More importantly, agricultural exports not
only grew but also diversified. The value of non-traditional (non-sugar) agricultural
exports increased from US$36 million in 1991 to US$80 million in 1995. As a result,
during that same period, the share of sugar in total agricultural exports declined from
57 percent to 37 percent. Further, in 1995, the estimated export revenue generated from
project-financed investments in bananas represented up to 10 percent of the value of total
banana exports from Belize, and, in shrimp up to 12 percent of the value of total shrimp
exports. The project's contribution to the liberalization of the export market and
improvements in banana extension services may have had a greater impact on increasing
exports than did the project credit component.
11.   Economic Impact. The sub-loans financed through the project were economically
sound. The farm/ production models developed at appraisal were updated by the ICR
mission. The DFC loan portfolio financed by the project (excluding the component's
canceled portion) had a satisfactory weighted internal financial rate of return of
27 percent, which was very much consistent with the expected rates of return in the
project appraisal. The project financed loan portfolio consisted of loans for citrus
(20 percent of the portfolio), bananas (43 percent of the portfolio), shrimp farming
(19 percent of the portfolio) and sea fishing (18 percent of the portfolio. The rates of
returns for these activities were: 27 percent, 30 percent, 25 percent and 16 percent,
respectively (see Part II Table 9).
12.   Financial Sector Objectives. The project was unable to achieve its financial
sector objectives. As the project did not generate any private bank involvement, the
project played no direct role in increasing private long term lending to the agricultural
sector. Paradoxically, the project, by bolstering the presence of DFC in the sector, may
have, reduced the incentive of the private banks to expand their long term agricultural
portfolios. Many of the DFC's borrowers, including those who obtained project financed



- 5 -
credit, were well-established short term borrowers of the private banks. In addition,
certain DFC advantages, such as soft donor financing, Central Government capital
infusions and exemptions from normal banking regulations, may have crowded the private
banks out of long term lending to the agricultural sector.
13.   DFC used most of the project's credit to finance large enterprises rather than its
normal clientele of small or medium sized farmers. The DFC maintained its standard
applicant requirements, including the provision of a bank credit assessment, as well as
collateral of 130 percent of the loan value. These may have favored larger enterprises
participating in the credit component. As a result, ten borrowers accounted for more than
80 percent of the sub-loan portfolio3. Loan sizes were large, with an average loan size of
US$180,000. One borrower received a loan of more than US$1.0 million.
14.   Institutional Objectives. The project's attainment of its institutional objectives
was mixed. The project helped to strengthen the institutional capacities of some
agricultural institutions, particularly the Banana Growers' Association (BGA). The
project was not instrumental in increasing the long term agricultural portfolio of the
private banks. The bulk of the project's institutional strengthening was directed to the
DFC. While there was much progress towards improving its financial situation, the
institution did not meet the agreed financial performance targets and its long term
sustainability remains in doubt. As shown in Table 5, DFC's total arrears as a percentage
of loan portfolio declined from 35 percent in 1990 to 10 percent in 1996. Also a more
meaningful measurement, loan portfolio affected by arrears more than 12 months, declined
from 50 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 1996. The impressive decline in the early
nineties seemed due primarily to loan write offs and substantial capital infusions from the
Central Government. Nevertheless, project-supported activities, such as an improved
monitoring system; a more active collection program; and better project appraisal also
contributed to preventing contamination from returning to its historically high levels. But
it is doubtful that the project resolved the fundamental weaknesses of the DFC and, as a
result, the institution will continue to require financial support from the Central
Government and donors.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
15.   Factors Not Subject to Government Control. A development outside the control
of the Bank or the Borrower which influenced the project's outcome was the withdrawal
of Hershey from Belize. As Hershey was the sole cocoa buyer and processor in Belize, its
departure radically depressed the local cocoa market. This development, along with a
parallel IFAD cocoa development project, were factors which stemmed completely the
project's intended efforts in the cocoa sector.
16.   Factors Subject to Government Control. Another important factor affecting the
project's outcome, especially with respect to the response of the private banks, was the
GOB's 1989 decision, taken after loan signing, to transfer the Central Government's

- 6-
deposits from the Central Bank to the commercial banks. The significant increase in the
private bank's deposits dramatically reduced commercial banks' need for any additional
liquidity - thus dampening the potential interest of the banks in this project.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
17.   On balance the project's investments in agricultural production are likely to be
sustained. The project contributed to the establishment and expansion of banana, citrus
and shrimp businesses and the sub-projects financed were all judged to be successful. The
Government's policy reforms which liberalized the export markets for these commodities
have clearly laid the groundwork to support the continued growth of non-traditional
agricultural exports. The project's objectives concerning improvements in financial
intermediation for the agricultural sector are judged to be less important, as it was never
clear that credit was a meaningful constraint to growth in exports. It is unlikely that the
DFC will achieve financial self-sufficiency. Had the Bank been able to dedicate greater
time to understand better the circumstances and practices of the private banks, perhaps
this group would have participated in the project. By supporting a public financial
institution, the project may have inadvertently crowded the private banks out of long term
lending to the agricultural sector.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
18.   Preparation and Appraisal. The project reflects oversights during identification
and appraisal. The Bank did not adequately identify and appraise the major factors
limiting exports, nor did it to determine the extent to which scarce credit limited export
growth. A review of the level of lending available to the sector at the time of project
preparation does not suggest that the sector suffered from a serious credit shortage. In
1988, the sector contributed 17 percent of the GDP and received a proportionate
18 percent of total national lending portfolio - 65 percent of which was from commercial
banks. Moreover, the value of the national agricultural portfolio represented nearly half of
the value of the sector's annual output (see Section B of Annex C).
19.   Another weakness was the Appraisal's inadequate assessment of the factors
impeding the private financial institutions, including commercial banks and other
institutions, such as savings and loan associations and credit cooperatives from
participating in the project. This in part reflects the Bank Group's own lack of experience
at that time in dealing with private financial intermediaries operating in a market
determined environment. Given that two-thirds of project credit were earmarked for the
private sector, the level of the Bank consultations during project appraisal with banks,
credit unions and cooperatives, appeared to be insufficient. Based on ICR Mission
interviews with private bankers in Belize, it would appear that the likelihood of their
participation would have been improved had the Bank: (i) held more extensive technical
discussions on the rediscount mechanism with the commercial banks; (ii) included
representatives of these private institutions in Mission wrap-up sessions and (iii) allowed



the private sector representatives to act as observers in other project discussions, including
the loan negotiations.
20.   Throughout Appraisal, it was mistakenly assumed that the Bank funds were to be
"blended" with the softer funds of the USAID facility, thus increasing the attractiveness of
the project credit line. However, the USAID agreement with the Central Bank precluded
financing of citrus through DFC. This assumption contributed to an overly optimistic
assessment of the attractiveness of the project credit line.
21.   The appraisal accurately diagnosed DFC's financial and management problems and
at negotiations agreement was reached on an action plan to correct them during
implementation. However, the difficulties in reforming a government-owned development
bank that was not subject to pressures of the market place, were underestimated.
22.   Supervision. Supervision was weak and incomplete. Although the DFC was
intended to be only one of several financial intermediaries, supervision concentrated more
on the DFC than on the project's progress in achieving its macroeconomic and sector
objectives. By April 1991, two years after project effectiveness, there had been no
disbursements of the project's credit component. In May 6, 1991, to compensate for
delays in project start-up, the LA was amended to defer the DFC financial performance
indicator target compliance schedule by two years. Later, the loan was amended to make
available to DFC US$1.5 million, which had been previously assigned exclusively to the
private banks. The original closing date was extended twice to December 31, 1995 and
December 31, 1996 in order to complete disbursements on subloans committed, in
addition to completing other agreed project components. At the first extension of the
closing date US$3,261,842.54 were canceled; at the final closing date $1,097,003.37 were
canceled. The eleven Bank Supervision Missions were focused almost entirely on the
financial performance of DFC, and its compliance with the financial indicator targets.
Performance in this respect proved difficult to gauge, as DFC was very slow in upgrading
its loan portfolio accounting and control capabilities. This situation plus disagreements
over how to calculate some of the indicators made enforcement of the agreement
problematic. Although little supervision was given to the actual loan portfolio and its
impact on expanding or diversifying agricultural exports, the ICR mission confirmed that
good results were achieved in this respect.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
23.   Project Preparation and Implementation. The Government's participation and
commitment in project preparation and design was generally weak. Nevertheless, project
management was sound, maintaining control of administrative expenses and effective
working relationships with DFC. The Central Bank, acting as apex intermediary, was
unable to resolve the problems which discouraged private banks from participating. It also
made persistent requests to the World Bank for clarifications of the project's scope, and
this held up the sub-loan approval process and contributed to disbursements delays.



24.   Compliance with Loan Covenants. The govemment fully complied with the LA
policy conditionality in a timely fashion. The GOB removed the shrimp export tax and the
citrus export licensing requirements. In addition, the GOB created the cocoa advisory
board and transferred the State's banana marketing and extension services to growers'
association twelve months ahead of the target date of December 1991. DFC was never
able to comply with the financial performance indicators in its agreed plan of action,
though it was able to improve the quality of its loan porfolio over the period.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
25.   Outcome. On balance, the project outcome was rated unsatisfactory. Demand for
credit proved to be very slow, requiring the cancellation of nearly half of the sub-loan
component of the Loan. Private banks which were expected to channel the bulk of the
sub-loan finance, chose not to participate. The long term viability of DFC as a commercial
enterprise is doubtful. On the other hand, while it is difficult to discern the extent to
which developments would have proceeded in the project's absence, the project
contributed to the establishment and expansion of banana, citrus and shrimp as important
sub-sectors of the national economy, particularly as generators of foreign exchange. The
project's role included not only the provision of long-term credit to finance some of these
operations, but perhaps more importantly, policy reform to liberalize and stimulate private
investment in the export markets for these commodities in Belize.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
26.   No specific plan has been prepared yet.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
27.   The most significant lessons learned are as follows:
(a)   Government-owned development finance institutions are unlikely to
succeed in achieving both a social objective and financial sustainability at
the same time;
(b)   Reform and restructuring of a government-owned development finance
institution is more likely to succeed, if it is subject to the discipline of the
market;
(c)   change in macroeconomic and sector policies can have a more positive
impact than project financial investments;
(d)   Private financial intermediaries will not actively participate, unless they
are carefully consulted on all the policies and procedures for a credit line
during its preparation, appraisal and loan negotiations.

Dear M.rs. Iyde:
BE=LZE - Agric-altural Credit and Export Development Project (Ln. 2959-BF-L)
`Mlrs. Anne del Castillo, Consultant, andS Mr. Dariel Mforeau, Senior
Agriculturalist from the World BanLk who visited Beiize from December 9 to
Deceember 17, 1996 on a supervision rmission of the above-referenced project, have
returned to Washington and reported their findings. We wish to thank the
Government and DFC for the cooperation extended to the miss.on.
The Development Finance Corporation's operations during project
implementation has indeed shown some improvements especially in the financial
results. MNfost of the investment projects financed under the Loan went to the banana
and citrus industries, as we!l as for fisheries and shrimp farms. However, to dininish
the risks of lending to small farmers without credit history and sufficient collateral,
azicultural lending through DFC was increasingly limited to medium to large well
established borrowers.
At the time of project preparation and appraisal, DFC was essentially the only
financial intermediary that provided terrn credit for smaLL and medium farmers in
Belize. DFC has also been in the forefront of the efforts to diversifyr agricultural
production and exports in the country away from sugar by providing term credit for
new export crops, which the commercial banks have been initially reluctant to finance.
Because DFC does not have centralized credit poLicies, but uses instead the directives
issued by individual donors, DFC's loan application and approval process is lengthy
relative to that of commercial banks, and it involves high transaction costs. During the
recent past years, the private agricultural sector demonstrated to be very dynamic to
diversify toward new export crops and in parallel, there was an increased participatioa
of private banks in lending for the agriculture sector.

Now, the fimdamol quesdon for DFC is its role and      as a public
financn insdon sizeDFC in one hand had obvious  caziesforproviding loan
to small imnds  d in anothe hand is in direct competition wit pivate com=dal
banks for providing loans to medium and large farmers.
The firn closing date for the Aspicultural Credit and Export Developmet
Project (LoanNo. 2959-BEL) is December 31, 1996. As mentioned in the Aide-
Memoire (attached), theBank is preparing an Implemenation Completioa Report
(ICR). This ICP needs to be done during the six months foUowing the closing date of
the project and it would have to include a draft of the Borrowers Evaluation Report.
We are pleased to learn that a consultant has already been identi£ed to undertake this
work and that the draft report would be completed and sent to the World Barnk by the
end of March 1997.
I would lLke to ta-ke the opportunity to wish you ard your farnily an happy new
year 1997.

World Bank Final Supervision Mssion December 9 - 17, 1996
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    Tnis Aide-MemoLre summarizes the findings of a World Bank F-mal Supervision
Mission comprising Mrs. Anne del Castilo (Consultant) and Daniel More-au (Mission
Leader) which visited BeTize between December 9 and December 17, 1996. The
mnission underwook field visits to the Banana Growers Association, the Citrus Growers
Association, some banana and citrus farms, Nova Shrimp Farms, and the Northern
Fishermen Cooperative. Tne mission warts to tha-n al individuals, agencies and
officials corn.ct5d for the excellent cooperation and the frank discussiors held.
Background and Setting.
2.    Loan Amount - Original:                 USS7.8 million
- Revised:                USS4.7 milLion
Disbursed Amount (10125196):     USS3.0 Million
Date of Effectiveness:                 04/06/89
Original Closing Date:                 12/3 1/91
CuZ.ent Closing Date:                  12/3 1196
3.    The objectves of the project are: (i) to assist the Borrower in financing such
productive facilities and resources in Belize as will contribute to the development of
agricultural exports; and (ii) to strengthen selected financial institutions providing
agricultural services or credit. The project provides a line of credit to finance
investment projects for export crop development as well as strengthening of institutions
providing support- services for export crop production: Development Finance
Corporation (DFC), Growers Association and the Minist.ies of Agriculture and
Natural Resources.
Overall Project Performance
4.    Most of the investmnents projects financed under the Loan went to the banana
and citrus industies, as well as for fisheries and shrimp farns. However, to diminish
the risks of lending to small farmers without credit history and sufficient collateraL
agricultural lending through DFC was increasingly limited to medium to large well
established borrowers (see Table I and Table n). As of October 25, 1996, out of the



-26 -                                            ANNEX B
revised Loan amount of US$4.7 million, the total amount disbursed from the Loaa was
about USS3.0 million.
DFC Financial Performance
5.     An imrorant measure of the financial peTeorm.ance of the DFC is portfolio
contarnina ion, or the share of loans affected by total arrears as well as the distrbution
of the total loans affecttd by arrears of more than and less than 12 months. Graph A
illustates tlh-e sicnificant declines in the level of loans affec-ed by arrears. This is due
to: (i) capital infusions from the Central Government in the early 1990s to reconcile its
accounts wihi the DFC and provide the DFC with fresh capital; (ii) improvements in
the DFC r        cia  moni:oring system; (ii) the DFC's mocre active co11ecdon program;
and (iv) bete-r project appraisal acdeities w.iLir. the DFC.  Nevertheless, it can be
observed tha-, af-er the initial drop in contailna4on due to the direct intervention of
the Central Covernment, subsequent reductons ir. contarrination have been reladvely
minor in recent years and still approaches 20 percent.

6.     Tnere was also an improvement of the DFC financial performance, as
measured against the indicators in the Action Plans:
* Annual rates of total arrears as a percentase of outstanding debt fell from 11
percent in 1995 to 9.6 percent in 1996 - well above the 1996 target rate of 5.0 percent;



-27-                                          ANNEX B
*  Annual rates of collecdon of nrfncipal and interest as a gercentag of debt owed t
the DFC fell from 107.7 percent in 1995 to 87.9 percent in 1996 - approximatng the
target minimurm of 90 percent for 1996;
*  Annual administrative costs as a Dercentgge of total costs has declined steadily -
falling from more than 8 percent in 1990 to 5.7 percent in 1995 and to 4.9 percent in
1996. Thus the 1996 targe: level of 5.5 percent was satisfied.
7.    However, to fully appreciate any efficiencies which may have been realized in
admirniistative cost, this raho needs to be assessed against the number of loans in the
por-tolio. A least a part of the "efficiency gaains" realized by the DFC has been due
to its reducion in the number of loan in its portfolio obtained through its gradual
process of increasing the loan size. Small loans (under BZS10,000) as a share of total
number of Ioans in the DFC por-folio declined from 79.8 percent in 1991 to 60.9
percent in 1995. Tne small loan share in the total poorUfo value declined from 16.6
percent in 1991 to 12.7 percernt in 1995. As a result, dur-ng that pericd, the average
loan increased 30%7o. When total costs (operatiopal plus salary) are compar-d against
the nurmber of loLns in the portfolio, the cost per loan irc:eased by 17 percent
between 1991 and 1995.
*  Annual debt to ecuitv rt;cs were si:JfcantIy reduced f-oro thei- 1992 level of
17:: 1. In 1993, the -atio fell to 11::1 and, in 1995 and 1996, the ra24o has stabilized
at 3::1. outperformng te target level of 4: 1; and
-  Annual returs to ep=uitv Tatio, while declining from 12.85 percent in 1995 to 9.85
percent in 1996 - still satisfied the target level set for 1996 of 3.5 percent. Tne
apiarent decline is a reflection of the ext-aordinary gaLns recorded in 1995, when the
DEC introduced the policy of recognizing annrual unr e^l ed incorm.e (losses),
particularly from foreign exchange gains (losses).
8.    Indicators specifying desirable levels for involvement in the agricultural sector
or a particular target beneiciay group have never been set. Nevertheless, it is clear
that the DFC's agricultural and small loan portfolios have declined dramatically in
recent years. These developments are a reflection of the DFC's: (i) desire to improve
its financial performance; and (ii) increasing participation in the housing sector. For
the DFC, agricultural and small loans have traditionally been the poorest performing,
in ter=s of supervision costs and risk. By limiting its agricultural portfolio to
relatively large Icans and borrowers with established credit histories and good
collateral, the DFC can reduce its risks and administrative costs.
9.    Preparation of Borrowers Contibution to the Irnplementation Completion
Report (ICR). N=  has confirmed that in collaboration with DFC, it will prepare a
draft of the Borrowers Evaluation Report to be included in the ICR for finalization and
submission to the World Banlk. It u,as agreed that the document should be available by
the end of March 1997. The Mission has provided advice as requested regarding the
document which should provide the Borrower's evaluation of:

(a) the Projects emc=on and inital opemton including an assessment of the Poject
objecdves, deign, implemention.and opeaton eperence;
(b) the Projeces cos and benefts, and the Ztent to which the purposes of the Loan
were achieved;
(c) the Borrower's own perfornance during the evoludon and implemntention of the
Project including the Bormwees obligations under the Loan Agreement special
emphasis should be given to lessons learned that may be relevant in the future; and
(d) the perform-mace of the Bark during the evolut4on and implement-ton of the
Project including the Ban-Vs obligations under the Loan Agreemnent and the
effectiveness of the rela"onshaip between the Borrower and the Bank; sceci! emphasis
should be given to lessons lea-ned that may be relevant in the future.
10.   Tne Borrower's Evaluadon Report will be atrched unedited to the ICR unIless it
is over ten pages long, in which case a summary should be prepared which will instead
be included in the ICR. To assist in the prepration of the document., Mv:D has been
prov,ded with a copy of World Ban-k Operaornai PoEc.es OP 13.55 and Bank
Procedures BP 13.55. The content of the Borrowers Report is outlired in
Operational Policies OP 13.55 page 1, para. 3.

DEVELOPMIENT IANCE CORP ORATION
Anriculture Credit and Export Development Proiect
Borrower's Contribution to hmplementation Completion Report
I.    The main proiect obiectives were:-
1.    Expand and promote diversification of Belize's Agricultrl Exports and improve its
balance of payments.
2.    Improve Banking Services for farmers and strengthen the financial condition of DFC in its
role as a financial intermediary.
In order to achieve its objectives, the project design included the following components:-
1.    Establishment of a rediscount facility at the Central Bank of Belize, namely, the Belize
Credit Facility (BCF) to provide loans for financing export-oriented agricultural projects
throtugh public and private sector financial intermediaries.
2.    Development of Agricultural exports (bananas, cocoa, citus and cultured shrimp) through:
a) Provision of a Line of Credit;
b) Strengthening institutions providing support services for export crop production.
These included the Development Finance Corporation, the Banana Control
Board/Banana Growers Association, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and
the Ministry ofNahtual Resources
IlL    Assessment of Institutional Stren2thening and Development of Aericulthual Exports
(Cocoa and Bananas) provided by the Proiect.
The Development Flnance Corporation (DFC)
The World Bank project contributed significantly to the financial recovery of the DFC. The
Recovery Action Plan prepared by World Bank was closely monitored and evaluated by World
Bank staff To date, DFC has made satisfactory progress in meeting the financial performance
9



-37 -                                        ANNEX C
t Ltreeta and on s-quently otinue t  ccess fimds from international finding agencies ouch as the
European Investment Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank Teclhnical assistance received
under the project assisted in achieving among others the following:-
1.    Development of a Loan Administration and Collateral Administration Manual;
2.    Decentralization of branches;
3.    Establishnent of a Quality Control Department;
4.    Improvement of the Management Infornation Systems, particularly Accounting Information
Systems, and computerization of branches.
The objective of strengthening the DFC in terms of operational efficiency and credit delivery
capacity was therefore achieved.
Cacao Development
The project provided funds for a Cocoa Agronomist with support staff and vehicles to promote the
development of cocoa production in the Cayo and Stann Creek Districts. It was difficult to
convince farmers to plant cocoa instead of citrus due to depressed market conditions for cocoa and
the attractiveness of citrus. Nevertheless interest was expressed by several small fiamers to
cultivate a combination of citrus and cocoa. Most of the farmers, however, could not satisfy
lending requirements in terms of contribution, experience in the crop, and collateral. As a matter
of fact, a nurnber of these farmers had no land tenureship and those with land had poor farm
accessibilit.
Lending, as a result, was focused on existing citus farmers who required assistance for
rehabilitation and/or expansion. This was due to change in lending policies as a direct result of
fluctuating prices of citrus concentrates in the World Market and the fact that the industy required
to improve efficiency and consolidation rather than expansion. A total of 30 citrus loans
amounting to $1,500,000 to rehabilitate/expand 955 acres were granted. The project targeted
1,000 new acres by small to medium size farmers.
Banana Development.
World Bank finds were used to assist the Banana Control Board and subsequently the Banana
Girowers Association (BOA) with institutional strengthening to continue the development of the
banana industry. The assistance was received at an appropriate time, when marketing and
operational finctions were being transferred to the BGA. A Project Manager, paid from World
Bank funds assisted in this transition. Funds were also utilized to assist in the surveying and
subdivision of a parcel of land in the Bladen area for expansion. Assistance was also given to
equip the laboratory to conduct soil analysis and pest control research.



-38 -                                        ANNEX C
Due to BGA's policy to consolidate acreage tuder production (to keep production within the ECC
quotas) rathier than expand, acreage surveyed for expansion was not filly utilized, except for a
mere 100 acres. DFC loans were consequently limited to banana rehabilitation and financing of
infiastructure to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
Authorities in the industry felt that much more could have been accomplished if BGA/Project
Manager was given more authority to make decisions. The situation was further aggravated by
changes of officers responsible for monitoring this project component and the consequent transfer
of responsibilities from Ministry of Economic Development to Ministrv of Agriculture.
IIL    Establishment of the Belize Credit Facility (BCE) at Central Bank of Belize (CBB).
The BCF was set up at the CBB and became fimctional after some delays. Ihe constant movement
of staff caused some delays in the execution of loan agreements, approval of projects and
reimbursement of claims. Nevertheless, overall performance improved as the BCF Manager
improved its knowledge of World Bank policies and disbursement procedures and overall
administration of the project It can therefore be concluded that the BCF is now capable of
delivering credit to Financial Intermediaries. The project objective was therefore achieved-
IV.   The Participaion of Financial Intermediaries in Credit Delivery.
DFC is the only financial institution that signed the participatory agreement and delivered credit
under the World Bank fimds. Scotia Bank signed the participatory agreement but subsequently
withdrew from the programme.
The Commercial Bank's reluctance to participate was due to:
a)    High liquidity during project implementation;
b)    Uunwillingness to take risk by providing long-term development loans to small to
medium size farmers with no tack record
Notwithstanding the above, the DFC was able to deliver-credit for export oriented projects,
namely, citrus, bananas, shrimp trawlers and shrimp farms.

V.7.    Credit De+>r by DFC.
Despite no demand for cocoa loans and low demand for banana expansion, opportuities for
lending for banana rehabilitation and consolidation, citr  improvement and expasion, and
shrimp farning arose at a later stage. Consequently, DFC allocalion ofUSS2.4 million was
increased by World Bank to USS3.9 million. At December 31st, 1996, the following was
achieved by DFC only:-

VI   World Bank's Performance
The Supervision Mission spent many hours providing guidnce to omure DFC's compliance with
the Action Plan. It also exercised some flexibility to enable approval and drawdown of loan
fimds. Its assistance in implementing the Technical Assistace component (Training, Consultancy
etc.) was very fruitful.



-40-                                        ANNEX C
n tems of eligible sectors for lending, the borrower felt that more inestment projects could have
been financed if provision had been made for fimding rice production (Import substitultion) and
forestry products. Generally, World Bank's interest in the financial recovery of DFC and the
development of agricultural exports was great. World Bank's performance was therefore
saisactory.
VII.  Lessons Learnt
The long term future market outlook and viability of cocoa should have been studied prior to the
promotion of such crop. Identification of suitable land with accessibility, and identification of
bona fide farmers eligible for citrus loans under the programme should have been addressed prior
to implementation of programme.
Detailed studies would have showm that Belize's Banana Industrv camot compete on the World
Market due to its high production costs. The Project should have been designed to improve and
consolidate instead of expansionL BCB'sJBGA'a policy later emphasized consolidation.
Consequently fimds were lent for irrigation and rehabilitatiom Alternative possibilities that could
have been financed e.g. rice and forestry by-products were not considered by World Bank despite
the fact that earlier AIDE Memoire allowed such
With regards to non participation by the Commercial banks, flexibility in addressing banks'
concerns would have probably led to their participation.

(3)    Paragraph 5 - lines 5-6 - we would like to make the point that, in fact, th project did help to
*       ' . move the Development Finance Corporaton to a level of rinancial s f sufficiency. The
technical assistance which was received contributed significantly towa  greater efficiency
*       in loan de/ivery loan portfolio quality, accounting practices and man  menent information
sysfems. The credit component supplemented other available line of credit from the
Caribbean Development Bank and the EiE. Such strengthening  ss assisted in the
improvement in the performance of the Development Finance Corpon tion.
(4)    The statement in paragraph 7 that the 'Central Bank acting as apex intermediary
demonstrated little interest in solving the problems which discourage private banks from
*    . participating' is again cause for concerm. The Central Bank has p v/ded the following
comments.
During 1992, much effort was expended in an effort to g t commercial bank
participation.  With the exception of Barclays Bank that indic ted from the outset
their complete lack of interest in the project the Central Ba k along with IBRD
representatives held extensive discussions with commercia bank managers to
address their concerns on several occasions. All the issues arising ftm these
discussions were subsequently addressed in letters to these m nagers. As a nesult,
the 8ank of Nova Scotia executed the Participating Agree  nt in March 1993
.. .          although they were not subsequently able to identify projects uitable for fnancing
. -  :       Junder the IBRD.loan. The Belize Bank informed the Central ank in Decemrber of
* .   .     zthat year that while the Central Bank had adequately ccv red the issues and
* .  .   concams it had raised, the Belize Bank did not then have any an applications that
could be financed under the scheme. The Atiantic f3ank's lack of response to
several letters and reminders leaves open the question as to th real reason for their
subsequent decision not to participate in the project.
A more extensive discussion of the issues affecting the irpier, ntabon of this project
would. no doubt become very involved.  Commercial ba  s' excess liquidity,
satisfaction with traditional modus operandi, and inexperiene   prc] t preparation
and appraisal were all important issues which should have  propriately factored
into the I8RD's overall design of the project. For its part, th Centrl Bank's own
responsibility was more than adequately camried out. In paragr h 6 of a letter to you
dated July 21, 1993, the IBRD's Vicente Ferrer acknowledg d the Central Banks
*   .  efforts to encourage thea commercial banks to use the credit li e but also.noted that
*  .  . '    there was a general lack of interest on the part of the banks. 7 a statements alluded
to in the IMR.D's project completion report are therefore myst, ing.
: hope that the comments and observations which have been made can be ti ken account of in the
final draft of the Implementation Completion Report There is not the dou t that the project did
contribute to the development of the agricultural sector in Belize. I feel, howe ver, that we al would
have to agree that there were other extenuating circumstances which detr- :ted from the level of
* success which was foreseen at the time of project design.
. .    .WIMth best wishes!
Yours sincerely
