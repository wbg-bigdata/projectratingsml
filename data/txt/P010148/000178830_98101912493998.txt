THIRD WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
General
1.01      Nepal, located northeast of India, is about 800 km long, and lies
parallel to the main Himalayan mountain range. About two-thirds of the total
land area of 141,000 sq km consists of high mountains and their foothills (the
Mountains and the Hills), the remaining one-third, a narrow strip to the south
called the Terai, is the borderline to the Indo Gangetic plains. Rainfall is
substantial, ranging from 1,000 mm to 1,600 mm per year, but is unevenly dis-
tributed with heavy concentrations in the monsoon season from June to September.
Climatic conditions vary from tropical in the Terai plains to a tundra climate
in the mountainous north.
1.02      At the time of the last census in 1971, Nepal's population was 11.6
million. It is now estimated to be over 14.0 million (about 2.1% average annual
growth over a 10 year period). About 5% (0.7 million) live in more than 20
urban centers (Nagar Panchayats - urban community councils) whereas the rural
population inhabit about 28,000 scattered villages spread over some 4,000
communities (Gram Panchayats - village councils). Almost half of the urban
population live in the Kathmandu Valley.
1.03      Population projections are based on annual average growth rates of
1.5% for the Mountains, 2.25% for the Hills and 3% for the Terai and are as
follows:

inhabiting semi-urban environs of some project towns  (included
in the rural population).

The urban growth rate is estimated at 5% per year. There is a steady migration
projected from the Hills to the Terai, particularly to the urban areas of the
Terai market centers and the district or zone headquarters.
1.04      Water-borne as well as several other communicable diseases are
prevalent in Nepal. Poor sanitation facilities and lack of convenient access
to safe water are the main contributing factors. Insufficient hygiene results
in diseases caused by parasites found in human feces (most commonly hookworm
and ascaris) and also causes diarrheal diseases, an important cause for high
infant mortality. The following information on water-borne diseases illustrates
the situation in the proposed project towns during 1979:
Incidences     Deaths
(a)  cholera                              811            7
(b)  typhoid fever                        505           12
(c)  bacillary dysentry                   539           26
(d)- amoebic dysentry                   3,744           31
(e)  diarrhoea and gastro enteritis   2,411            104
(f)  lnfectious hepatitis                 146           10
(g)  hookworm                           2,015            1
(h)  roundworm                            155            -
The above statistics covers only the number of patients who were treated in
hospitals. 1/ It does not include an allegedly large number of unreported
cases.
Water Resources
1.05      Dense river networks make Nepal a hydrologically favorable country.
The rivers Sapta Kosi, Sapta Gandaki and Karnali are the major river systems
in Nepal. The medium river systems are Kankai, Kamala, Bagmati, Tinau, Rapti
and Babai which drain to the Southern Nepal. The medium rivers Mechi and
Mahakali form the border with India in the east and in the west respectively.
In the Hills springs are common and the possibilities of tapping groundwater
near riverbeds are believed to be promising. Surface water sources supple-
mented by groundwater are, therefore, plentiful.
1.06      In the Terai, groundwater is usually available in the required
quantities. The water table is shallow, anywhere between ground level and
20 m below ground level. In some cases even artesian pressure exists. Know-
ledge on groundwater availability has improved considerably through the two
earlier IDA projects in the Kathmandu Valley and through the work of the
Groundwater Resources Development Project (GRDP), which carries out regular
drilling programs mainly for irrigation projects throughout Nepal, especially
in the Terai.
1.07      Quality of water from spring and river intakes is generally accept-
able, however, increases in color, turbidity and suspended solids occur during
1/   The total number of hospital cases was about 31,500.

heavy rains. The bacteriological quality of the water requires chlorination.
In the Terai, the groundwater is of acceptable quality but in some cases iron
and manganese content may be above the level recommended by WHO. Chlorination
is also recommended as a minimum treatment to ensure acceptable bacteriological
quality of the water.
Sector Organization
1.08       Provision of drinking water and sanitation facilities is the res-
ponsibility of the following entities:
(a)  Water Supply and Sewerage Board (WSSB) under the Ministry
for Water, Power and Irrigation (MWPI). It is planned that WSSB
will gradually be responsible for the urban water and sanitation
sector in communities with a population of more than 10,000
inhabitants. Frequently, fringe villages in surrounding areas
also fall under its authority. WSSB carries out planning, design
construction and operation of systems and works w:ithin its areas
of operation.
(b)  Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD) under MWPI.  WSSD
will be responsible for the sector in rural communities with
populations between 1,500 to 10,000 but it presently also
deals with some urban systems not yet taken over by WSSB.
In discharging its responsibilities it carries out planning,
design and construction of systems, and normally hands them
over for operation to the respective panchayats. In case a
community does not have the expertise or the funds for
operating its system, WSSD assumes the responsibility of
operating it.
(c)  Local Development Department (LDD) under the Ministry of Home
and Panchayat (MHP). The Department is responsible for rural
systems in communities with a population below 1,500. It
carries out planning, design and construction of systems but
transfers the operation to the respective panchayats.
1.09      WSSB has taken over operation of the water systems in six town
panchayats, namely, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur (together called the
Kathmandu Valley), Pokhara, Biratnagar and Birganj, and the sewerage system
in Kathmandu. These systems are now being extended under the two ongoing
projects. WSSB's role will expand gradually through projects to cover addi-
tional urban areas.
1.10      WSSD currently operates 38 water supply systems.  Under the Fourth
Development Plan (DP - 1971 through 1975), WSSD and LDD constructed some 100
medium and small water supply schemes, and the program under the Fifth DP
(1976-80) called for construction of about 90 systems by WSSD, and over 500
systems by LDD. These targets are ambitious and it is estimated that they
will be met only by the end of FY81.



- 4 -
1.11      In addition to the above-mentioned entities, HMG's Irrigation and
Resettlement Departments occasionally provide water supply facilities on a
limited scale through their various rural development projects. These proj-
ects, however, are of limited importance and represent only a minute portion
of the total sector development.
Service Levels
1.12      Presently, all urban centers have piped water supply which serves
approximately 80% of the urban population. Only about 30% of the urban popu-
lation with water supply use private house connections and the average con-
sumption is estimated to be about 50 lcd. However, most of the systems are
not operated adequately, and many of them provide only very poor and inter-
mittent supply. Within the systems operated by WSSB, served population is
about 85% of the total population of those areas, 50% of the served popula-
tion have private house connections and the average water consumption is about
78 lcd.
1.13      In rural areas only about 900,000 people living in over 200 villages
(6% of the rural population) enjoy piped water supply. Average consumption is
estimated to be 45 lcd. The newer systems are mainly in the Hills which have
received priority over the Terai, mainly due to the fact that even untreated
water is not within easy reach there. These rural systems have gravity supply
from springs or rivers and the population is served through standpipes. The
situation in the Terai is less severe because groundwater, is generally
available. However, most of the dug wells and shallow tubewells with hand-
pumps are polluted due to poor construction and/or improper use.
1.14      Countrywide only about 10% of the total population enjoy safe water
supply and estimates are that only about 16% of the total served population
have private house connections. The population not served with piped supply
use springs, ponds, canals, streams and rivers. However, these sources are
not protected and their degree of pollution is generally high. Furthermore,
water use is reduced to a minimum because of long carrying distances which,
in turn, has a detrimental effect on personal hygiene and public health.
1.15      The existing, fragmentary sewerage system in the core area of
Kathmandu would be able to serve about 25,000 people if it were operative.
However, due to lack of proper maintenance, the system has been out of commis-
sion and is presently being rehabilitated. Together with the sewerage system
in Bhaktapur, about 5% of the total urban population could enjoy the benefits
of water-borne sewage disposal. In larger provincial towns less than 20% of
the population has some latrine facilities whereas practically no sanitation
facilities exist in smaller towns and rural areas.
HMG's Development Plans and Sector Goals
1.16      In the light of the International Drinking Water and Sanitation
Decade, HMG has carried out work for establishing a ten-year plan (1981-1990)
for sector development. This plan is now being completed and draft reports
have been made available. Utilizing the agencies described above (paras.
1.08-1.10), HMG expects to reach the following goals:



(a)  provide water supply services to all urban population in
the country's Nagar Panchayats by 1990; and
(b) provide at least one reliable source of water supply in
each rural community. The estimates comprise about 2,250
1_)ed systems in the Mountains and the Hills and 35,000
shallow wells in the Terai, covering about 65% of the popu-
lation in these areas by 1990.
The overall population coverage would be about 68% by 1990. The program also
makes a reference to providing sewerage facilities in six major urban centers,
but no specific plan has so far been developed.
1.17      WSSB is expected to continue to take over more urban systems so that
before the end of the decade it would operate all urban water systems. With
respect to rural water supply, WSSD is expected to construct all medium size
systems and 18,500 shallow tubewells, and LDD all small size systems and 16,500
shallow tubewells. The division of responsibility between WSSD and LDD seems
artificial and is being studied further.
1.18      Apart from providing sewerage (or sanitation) facilities in urban
areas through WSSB, HMG has plans to promote and coordinate environmental
sanitation activities through the Department of Health Services (DHS). The
immediate objective is to promote appreciation of the importance of sanitary
disposal of waste water, excreta and solid wastes through motivating school
authorities, government departments and local communities.  Similarly, WSSD
and LDD, assisted by WHO, UNICEF and bilateral donors, have plans to develop
latrine construction programs in collaboration with panchayats. The UNDP
Global Project on low cost sanitation, for which the Bank is Executing Agency,
is establishing two demonstration projects for improving sanitation in urban
environments.
Sector Investments
1.19      The funds required to cover the above programs are estimated at
US$162 million, US$59 million for the urban sub-sector and US$103 million
for the rural sub-sector. According to the information obtained, the cost
estimates on which these financing requirements are based represent 1980 price
levels and do not include price escalation. Consequently, much higher costs
must be expected and close monitoring of price escalations must be carried out
annually for proper budget allocations. HMG's intention is to cover these
costs under the Sixth and Seventh DPs.
1.20      In the past HMG' s investments in the sector have been as follows:

The table indicates that the water sector's share of development expenditures
has been low. To meet the goals of the ten-year plan, however, investment
levels must be increased considerably.
Sector Constraints
1.21      Overall, future development of the water supply and sewerage sector
faces three major constraints: manpower, supply of material and finances. It
will only be possible to overcome gradually the shortage of manpower through
continuous and patient training efforts which would not only provide the technical
knowledge but also instill the necessary discipline that is a prerequisite for
successful sector development and operation. Timely supply of material has
in the past been an occasional problem due to Nepal's geographical remoteness.
Sector financing is problematic mainly because of the Sector's heavy reliance
on the Government budget due to a wide spread lack of capacity to generate
sector-internal funds. WSSB has barely been able to cover its operating
expenses and indications are that hardly any cost recovery has materialized
in the rural areas. Although not yet firmed up, HMG plans to continue to use
multilateral assistance for urban developments. It also intends to utilize
external financing to a larger degree than in the past for rural schemes
together with grant funds from the United Nations International Children's
Emergency Fund (UNICEF) as well as bilateral donors. In view of the above,
the overall sector targets in respect of population coverage seem to be very
ambitious, and it will be necessary to exercise a certain degree of caution
while setting up targets for individual projects in future.

Previous Bank Involvement
1.22      IDA has had two prior lending operations for water supply and sewer-
age. The first Credit (US$7.8 million, 470-NEP) was approved on April 30, 1974,
and a supplement to it (US$4.0 million) on April 25, 1977. The first project
financed under this Credit is expected to be completed by the end of 1980.
1.23      The second IDA Credit (US$8.0 million, 704-NEP) was approved on
April 26, 1977. The Credit was later supplemented with an EEC Special Action
Credit (US$3.0 million, 26-NEP) to assist HMG in meeting its share of project
financing. In addition to the two water supply credits IDA also assists in
developing rural water supply through Rural Development Projects.
1.24      In the past IDA has concentrated on assisting HMG in implementing
its program in the urban sub-sector. The proposed Project generally continues
along the same line but also includes areas with a distinctly rural character.
After a very slow start which resulted in a delay of project completion of
about three years for the first project, WSSB has considerably improved its
project implementation capabilities and has started to build up operational
units capable of constructing, operating and maintaining their installations.
This recent encouraging performance on the technical side is unfortunately not
being matched by WSSB's financial results which is predominantly a result of
low tariff levels. Chapter V deals in detail with this aspect.
II. POPULATION, SERVICE LEVELS AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT AREAS
Project Areas
2.01      The project area covers the towns of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur
in the Kathmandu Valley (capital area of Nepal, the Valley), Pokhara (capital
of Kaski District), Biratnagar (capital of Morang District), Birganj (capital
of Parsa District) and of six provincial towns; Bhairawa (capital of Rupandehi
District), Butwal (in Palpa District), Dharan (in Sunsari District), Hetauda (in
Makwanpur District), Janakpur (capital of Dhanusha District) and Nepalganj
(capital of Banke District). The first project included the Valley and Pokhara.
The second project extended WSSB operations to Biratnagar and Birganj. Loca-
tions of the project towns are shown on map IBRD 14959.
2.02      Kathmandu and Lalitpur are separate Nagar Panchayats, and Bhaktapur,
a neighboring town, is an important trading center and historical tourist
attraction in the Valley. The nine provincial towns are important local
trading centers and some of them are district capitals. Biratnagar, Birganj
and especially Hetauda, also have significant importance as growing industrial
centers. Bhairawa, Biratnagar, Birganj, Janakpur and Nepalganj are located
in the Terai and Butwal, Dharan and Hetauda (450 m above sea level) on the
hills north of the Terai. Pokhara is located in a valley on the foothills of
the Himalayas. Because of its location close to several of the highest peaks
of the Himalayas, Pokhara is also a major tourist center in Nepal. A common
feature of the project towns is that the environs of the developed town area
include several fringe villages with considerable population and with a dis-
tinctly rural character.



-8-
Population
2.03      The latest available national census results are from 1971 published
by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Results of this census are given for
various towns by panchayats and wards but their boundaries were in some cases
changed in the following years. The present total population has been derived
from various other sources, such as data collected by panchayats for elections
and other purposes. Future growth rates have been estimated at 3% per annum
based on historic trends except for Pokhara and Butwal, where a 5% increase
has been assumed because of heavier migrations from surrounding areas to these
towns, and for Hetauda where a rate of 7% is expected because of its growing
industrial nature. In some Terai towns such as Biratnagar and Birganj, the
growth rates of environs are estimated at 4%,also due to migration.
2.04      The population projections through 2000 are as follows:
1980       1985        1990        2000
Kathmandu Valley       399,700    471,900    548,900    715,600
Pokhara                 54,300      68,500      83,300    124,800
Biratnagar              73,700      89,000      97,700    128,300
Birganj                 37,000      42,900      49,700      66,800
Six Towns /a           162,900    197,000    236,300    414,900
Total Project Area  727,600    869,300  1,015,900  1,450,400
/a   The largest town is Dharan, with the present population
estimated at 43,100, and the smallest is Butwal with a
population of about 20,000.
The details for the Six Towns are given in Annex 1.
Level of Water Supply Service
2.05      The existing service levels in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara, the
areas where improvements were already started under the first project, are
reasonably high, 94% of population served in the Valley and 90% in Pokhara.
Respective consumption levels are 80 lcd and 62 lcd. In the Valley almost
half of the served population receives its supply through private house
connections, but in Pokhara only about 37%. Service hours in the Valley are
three hours in the morning and three in the evening but are being significantly
increased after commissioning of new sources under the first project. Since
completion of the first project works in March 1979, Pokhara has enjoyed
24 hour supply.
2.06      In general the situation in the provincial project towns is much
worse. Less than 40% of the population is served (lowest 27% in Bhairawa) and
the average consumption amounts to about 60 lcd. Supply hours vary from five
hours to ten hours per day. The proportion of population served through stand-
pipes is usually more than 50% (highest 78% in Biratnagar). However, there are



- 9 -
a few exceptions: in Birganj where the existing system serves a limited area,
the population served is 59% of the total and out of that, 77% are served
through private connection; in Bhairawa only 27% of the population has acctss
to safe water supply of which 68% own private connections; in Butwal there
is a large existing system serving about 85% of the population, and out of
that, 72% through standpipes; Dharan has a similar situation. After comple-
tion of the proposed Project, about 83% of the population in the project areas
will have access to safe water. This means that the total of about 720,000
(out of that 156,000 incremental) people will have significantly improved
water supply after the Project and about 900,000 (336,000 incremental) people
by 1990. Details of existing and future service levels are given in Annex 1.
2.07      Presently, the water production is not metered and installation of
bulk water meters is underway in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara. All new
sources being constructed under the two projects will be metered. Metering
of house connections is well underway in the Valley and Pokhara (about 60% in
the Valley and 80% in Pokhara) and is being started in Biratnagar and Birganj.
All house connections in the Six Towns are unmetered and therefore the con-
sumption statistics are of questionable accuracy and only based on sample
investigations by consultants. Non-domestic consumption, including industrial,
commercial, institutional and public consumption, is also based on similar
investigations and is estimated to be from 10 lcd to 18 lcd in the Valley,
depending on the nature of the area. In the provincial towns this is esti-
mated to be 8 lcd, except in Birganj (12 lcd), and in Pokhara (14 lcd).
There are only a few large non-domestic water users who often have their own
independent supplies. Unaccounted for water is estimated to range from 40% to
60% of production based on assessment of the condition and age of the supply
system.
Level of Sanitation Service
2.08      In the core area of Kathmandu the old combined sewerage system was
established around 1900, but due to lack of adequate maintenance it is virtually
non-operational. The first project provided equipment for sewer cleaning and
WSSB has taken up the necessary rehabilitaiton work. This old system covers
an area with a population of about 25,000 which is estimated to grow to about
30,000 by 1985 and to 40,000 by 1990. Under the first project sewage treat-
ment works were constructed (three stage stabilization ponds) with a capacity
estimated to be adequate beyond 1990. The system is also being extended,
including interceptor sewers, trunk mains and laterals. This will be further
extended under the second project and the proposed project. Total population
coverage after these extensions is estimated to be about 67,000 by 1985
(104,000 by 1990).
2.09      In Bhaktapur the sewerage system is also being improved and extended
under the Bhaktapur Development Project which is assisted by the German techni-
cal aid.  The system includes house connections and public toilets; the exist-
ing population coverage is about 10,000 and is estimated to be increased to
18,000 by 1985. At present an interim sewage treatment is provided by means
of oxidation ponds, and permanent treatment works will be constructed in the
near future.



-10 -
2.10      The total population served by sewerage systems is only about 9%
in the Valley but is estimated to increase to 18% by 1985 and 25% by 1990.
About 60% of the households in Kathmandu have latrine facilities inside the
houses and 23% outside the houses. The rest use public toilets or defecate in
the fields. This information is based on a household survey in Kathmandu. The
situation is believed to be worse in other parts of the Valley. In provincial
towns (Pokhara, Biratnagar and Birganj), based on some sample surveys, less
than 20% of the population have latrine facilities inside the houses and more
than 50% are without any latrine facilities. In the six new towns there is no
data available, but it is believed that the majority,probably more than 60% of
the population,is without latrine facilities. Septic tanks are used at some
institutional and commercial buildings. A few private houses also use septic
tanks as well as pit privies.
2.11      HMG has initiated a health education program in Nepal which includes
sanitation. Health inspectors are trained and assigned to work at Health
Posts throughout the country. Technical knowhow and assistance is being pro-
vided through other donor agencies (para. 1.18), especially with respect to
sanitation in rural areas. WSSB is especially interested in the results of
demonstration projects under UNDP's global project in order to apply that
experience to improving sanitation in its areas of operation.
Water Supply/Waste Disposal Systems and Demand
2.12      Annex 1 shows the production capacities of the existing water supply
systems, as well as capacities of the proposed new works (see also paras. 3.03
and 3.04). In the Kathmandu Valley about 70% of the existing production
capacity comes from surface sources, river and spring intakes. Major surface
sources are provided with various types of treatment which usually are used
only during the monsoon season in order to reduce turbidity. All other times
of the year the physical and chemical quality is acceptable.  However, these
sources are subject to pollution. Chlorination is therefore required and will
also be needed in the future. New spring sources constructed under the first
project are designed in such a way that with the exception of chlorination,
no additional treatment is needed. The quality of groundwater to be tapped
in the future is expected to be good.
2.13      In the provincial towns where river/spring intakes are in use as a
water source, turbidity during monsoon rains has been a problem. However,
construction of infiltration galleries (para. 3.04) is believed to reduce this
problem. Groundwater quality in the Terai is generally good.
2.14      The water demand at various project towns is calculated on the basis
of population and per capita consumption projections and of the estimated
reductions in the unaccounted for water. Generally,the proposed increase in
production capacity will be adequate beyond 1990. In the Kathmandu Valley,
however, it is recommended to develop the proposed well fields gradually in
order to obtain better field data; as a first step, 1990 requirements would
be met.
2.15      In carrying out the sample consumption investigations, consultants
have classified households with different types of sanitary facilities and have



- 11 -
studied correlations relative to water consumption (modern sanitary facilities,
hand flushed toilets, dry pit toilets and no toilets). The basic estimate of
per capita water consumption in the various categories has been kept unchanged
during the forecast period. However, as a result of the fact that customers
will gradually improve their sanitation facilities and thus increase their
demand for water, a moderate growth in the overall average per capita consump-
tion has been assumed. Per capita consumption through standpipes is estimated
to be about 40 lcd and is kept unchanged over the projected period. Details
of projected service levels and future water demands are given in Annex 1. In
summary, consumption levels after completion of the Project are estimated to
be about 70 lcd average in the provincial towns (ranging from 60 lcd to 85 lcd)
and about 105 lcd in the Kathmandu Valley. Served population in the Valley and
Pokhara would be 97% and in the other provincial towns close to 60%. At that
time only 50% or less of the population is expected to be served through
standpipes, the lowest estimated figure being in Hetauda (18%). Based on the
established connection program (para. 5.11 and Annex 2), which is considered
to represent the minimum of what WSSB is expected to implement 1/, the pro-
posed Project would constitute a substantial step with respect to HMG's goal
of serving 100% of the urban population in the country by 1990 (para. 1.16).
However, it is expected to meet, by 1985, only about 25% of the incremental
population in the project towns and about 21% countrywide. This shows that
HMG should make great efforts in addition to the Project in order to reach the
1990 target of 100% urban population coverage. The scheduled works under the
Project (paras. 3.08 and 3.09) will provide a 24 hour supply for the estimated
served population.
2.16      Sewerage flows for the Kathmandu system extension were calculated
by assuming that 85% of the water used would be returned to the sewers from
households with higher standard sanitary facilities (washbasin, shower and
cistern flushed toilets). A 50% return assumption has been used for those
households which have only handflushed toilets or a latrine facility outside
the house (the proportion of these households will decrease over time). Also,
sewage flows for 1990 and 2000 have been projected and indications are that
the sewage treatment capacity now constructed under the first project will
be adequate beyond 1990. A program for installing new sewer connections has
been established and is presented in Annex 2.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Background
3.01      The Project is part of HMG's ten-year development plan (paras. 1.16
and 1.17) for the water sector. The need for the Project was recognized
when the second project was appraised and, consequently, funds were included
for preparing the necessary studies (master plans and feasibility studies)
for the proposed Project. For the purposes of the above studies WSSB
1/   A very cautious approach was taken in establishing the program and
improvements may well occur.



- 12 -
had selected six provincial towns (para. 2.01) to be included in the proposed
Project in addition to the areas covered by the first and second projects.
The Project would cover about 35% of HMG's sector development program from
FY81 through FY85 (para. 1.19).
Project ObJectives
3.02      The Project is designed to continue HMG's efforts to provide safe
water supply to all urban population by 1990. This is planned to be achieved
through a series of projects expanding WSSB's operation to new provincial
towns. The main objectives of this Project are:
(a)  to further improve the water supply situation in the four
areas now being covered under the second project through
extending supply hours and expanding services to a larger
portion of the population;
(b)  to augment and extend the water supply systems in six addi-
tional towns which also cover areas with a distinctly rural
character;
(c)  to extend the sewerage system in the Kathmandu Valley; and
(d)  to continue to assist WSSB's development into a self-
sufficient public utility organization and to improve
the local capacity in carrying out design and supervi-
sion of water supply and sanitary engineering works.
Technological Considerations
3.03      On the basis of experience from the first project the most feasible
new source of water in the Kathmandu Valley is considered to be groundwater
which will be obtained through developing well fields at three different loca-
tions. An attempt to start tapping groundwater is also planned for Pokhara,
and expectations based on the consultant's study are that this will be success-
ful.  While there are additional surface sources beyond those constructed under
the first project in both areas, they are much further distant from the supply
area, and thus proportionately more expensive.
3.04      The towns located on hills just north of the Terai (Butwal, Dharan
and Hetauda) will continue to rely on river and spring sources. The intake
structures will, however, be improved under the Project to include infiltration
galleries at spring intakes and river side collection chambers with horizontal
infiltration pipes at river intakes. The infiltration galleries are now being
tested under the preliminary engineering (para. 3.16) in Pokhara and are
believed to provide a simple, inexpensive water treatment, requiring only
supplemental treatment through chlorination.
3.05      The basic design criteria of the Project have been kept modest in
order to keep the investment costs at the lowest possible level. However,
certain system components, such as transmission mains, have been designed
for the full capacity of the respective source keeping in mind that the main



- 13 -
components of the system should be able to accommodate peak hour flows in
the future without costly modifications.
3.06      WSSB's performance with respect to implementation of the proposed
Project can be expected to improve further for the following reasons:
(a) In-house staff involvement in project design and
supervision will be significantly increased with a
corresponding decrease in consultant's assistance; and
(b) WSSB is now capable of handling major international
contracts and procurement.
Furthermore, local civil works contractors have successfully participated
to an increasing degree in the execution of works which resulted in
savings in mobilization time due to Nepal's relative remoteness.
Description of Project Components
3.07      The Project includes the following major components:
(a) further extensions of water supply source and distribution
works in the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Biratnagar and
Birganj (in towns where the water supply systems have been
or are now being constructed under the two previous projects),
Maps IBRD 14970 and IBRD 14971;
(b) augmentation and extension of water supply systems in the
Six Towns, Map IBRD 14972;
(c) extension of the sewerage network in the Kathmandu Valley
(Kathmandu - Lalitpur), Map IBRD 14973;
(d) consultants' services; and
(e) improvement of WSSB's operating capabilities.
The major physical components are shown in detail in Annex 3.
3.08      The improvements to source works are planned to increase production
capacities to meet the projected peak day demand in 1990. However, in the
Terai towns where the source is groundwater it is recommended that new wells
would have a minimum capacity of 4.0 Mid. This capacity in many smaller schemes
will, together with small existing capacities, be adequate well beyond 1990.
The investment is justified because the incremental cost for providing tubewells
with a capacity which is higher than that immediately required, is negligible.
In the Kathmandu Valley the development of groundwater sources is planned to
meet the requirements up to about 1990. Apart from meeting this demand, the
drilling program will also provide a sound basis for defining additional well
drilling programs in future.



- 14 -
3.09      The distribution systems are planned to enable WSSB to meet at least
the minimum connection program (para. 2.15). A 24-hour service would be
available, but minimum residual pressure of about 5 meters would be provided
at peak hours only. Service reservoir capacities are planned to be expanded
to meet at least three hours storage capacity at peak hour flows.
3.10      Sewerage system extension is a minimum program which will provide
sewer services to central areas of Kathmandu and will enable WSSB to meet 17%
population coverage in Kathmandu and Lalitpur by 1985.
3.11      WSSB's operational capacity will be improved through (a) manpower
training, (b) providing service vehicles and equipment, and (c) constructing
essential operational buildings, such as technical offices, workshops, stores
and garages at various project locations.  Training will include 4 to 5
fellowships for key senior level staff and equipment and facilities for imple-
menting the established training program.

3.13      As the Project consists of various components to be initiated over
a period of about three years, and due to the fact that the works are either
a continuation of the facilities being constructed under the two ongoing proj-
ects or are similar to these facilities, the cost estimates have been based on
design details from the updated master plans for the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara,
Biratnagar and Birganj and from the feasibility studies for the Six Towns. They
were compared with tender prices obtained between October and December 1979 for
similar types of work under the second project.  Physical contingencies of 10%
for common services, buildings and equipment, 15% for service reservoirs and
primary networks, and 20% for secondary networks and tubewell schemes have been
allowed for. In assessing the magnitude of the expected inflationary trends
it has been assumed that the proximity of the Indian economy will have a large
influence on the price development in Nepal. Consequently, the provision for
price contingencies uses the annual rates expected to materialize in India.
They are 10% for 1980, 8% for 1981, 7% for 1982 and 1983, and 5% for 1984 and
thereafter.
3.14      The foreign cost component of the Project is estimated at about 51%
(US$17 million equivalent) including indirect foreign costs. This is based on



- 16 -
the assumption that a major part of equipment and materials will be imported.
The average cost per capita based on 1990 served population is US$20.0 equiv-
alent for the second project towns where the works are largely extensions to
systems under implementation, and US$42.0 equivalent in the Six Towns where
works also include basic facilities such as source works and transmission
mains. These costs are acceptable.
Project Engineering and Implementation
3.15      Although adequately staffed to carry out its operational require-
ments, WSSB needs the assistance of consultants for more complex design work,
including preparation of specifications and bidding documents as well as tender
evaluation of major contracts and general construction supervision. With
WSSB's increased experience which it acquired in the context of the two pre-
vious projects, the consultant's involvement will be reduced and WSSB's own
staff will take over larger portions of the design work. It is planned that
the consultants will be responsible for the final engineering design of tube-
wells, river/spring intakes, service reservoirs, transmission mains, primary
networks and sewerage works. They will also provide specialist assistance in
tubewell drilling but only general assistance with respect to supervision
of the other works. It has therefore been agreed as a condition of Credit
effectiveness that WSSB will have made satisfactory arrangements for the
employment of consultants. WSSB will be responsible for the design of
secondary networks, chlorination stations in provincial towns and all
operational buildings; it will take the lead in all implementation supervision.
3.16      WSSB has shortlisted international consultants
for the above tasks. The consultants to be selected may associate themselves
with local consultants, or, if this is not possible, WSSB will arrange for an
adequate number of its staff to work with consultants as counterparts. The
engineering consultants' costs are estimated at US$2.10 million consisting
of US$0.25 million for preliminary engineering 1/ and US$1.85 million for
final engineering and supervision. The estimate provides for 15 man-months,
under preliminary engineering, and 135 man-months, under final engineering
and supervison of international consultants' services and for the cost of
vehicles, survey and other equipment, local transportation, printing of
tender documents and other minor items. The total cost estimate also includes
about 1,080 man-months of counterpart time to be associated with the interna-
tional consultants and about 1,500 man-months of time of WSSB in-house person-
nel. The average expatriate man-month cost (including salary, costs, fees,
international travel and subsistence) is US$10,000. The total estimate
represents about 6% of the total project cost excluding the cost for future
project preparation and for training. This is a reasonable level.
3.17      Final design documents will be ready for a well drilling contract
to cover works in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara and for all major material
supply contracts so that tendering can occur in July 1980. In the meantime,
1/   Preliminary engineering (US$0.25 million) financed under the Association's
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was initiated in January 1980 and is
scheduled to be completed in June 1980.



- 17 -
WSSB will continue field survey works started under preliminary engineering
and prepare final design documents for pipe laying works. The final design of
major civil works will have to be started in September 1980 in order to enable
bidding of these works starting in July 1981. The overall project implementa-
tion schedule is shown in Annex 5, and the contract schedule in Annex 6.
The project is estimated to be completed by July 1985.
Land Acquisition
3.18       In the past, acquisition of land and rights of way has not been a
problem for project implementation. To assure that this remains so in future,
HMG and WSSB have agreed during negotiations that they will acquire all land
and secure all rights of way in accordance with the project construction
schedule.
Project Financing
3.19       An IDA Credit of US$27.0 million is proposed.  It would finance
about 83% of the total project cost net of duties and taxes. For financing
of the feasibility studies as well as training, HMG intends to apply for UNDP
technical assistance. The Credit would finance all direct and indirect for-
eign currency costs (US$16.5 million equivalent) and about 68% (US$10.5 mil-
lion equivalent) of local currency cost of the Project. The remaining local
cost of US$4.8 million equivalent would be financed by HMG in the form of
equity through normal budget allocations. HMG will also finance duties and
taxes estimated at US$0.9 million.
Procurement Procedures
3.20       Annex 6 indicates the estimated grouping of contracts.  All major
material and equipment contracts, pipe materials, fittings, valves and water
meters, amounting to about US$10.6 million equivalent, would be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Association's guidelines. Local competitive bidding (LCB) will be used mainly
for procurement of vehicles, tools and equipment, and, possibly, for well
casing and screen pipes of mild steel and chlorination equipment (to be used
in some Terai towns) which are readily available through local agencies. LCB
will be carried out under "Local Procurement Procedures" which are acceptable
to IDA, and will cover contracts of up to US$75,000 equivalent each. These
are estimated to total about US$1.2 million equivalent.
3.21       Most civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis ICB.  These
contracts are estimated to represent about 70% of the total value of civil
works amounting to about US$12.0 million.  Construction of operational build-
ings, primary networks in Janakpur and Nepalganj and the majority of secondary
networks in all project towns, totalling about US$4.9 million, will be con-
tracted under LCB. The maximum value of any individual system so constructed
or of its annual segment is estimated at about US$150,000 equivalent. In addi-
tion, construction of some intake and similar minor structures and individual
drillings in Terai towns may take place under LCB. In well drilling GRDP



- 18 -
may also participate.  The value of such individual contracts is estimated
not to exceed US$30,000 equivalent. 1/
3.22       In the bidding process for materials and equipment, the standard
domestic preference of 15% on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duty,
whichever is lower, would be applicable in bid evaluation. Correspondingly,
for civil works under ICB a domestic preference of 7.5% is proposed for
evaluation purposes.
3.23       IDA would carry out prebidding reviews of all documents for material
and equipment contracts exceeding US$75,000 equivalent, and of all documents
for civil works under ICB.  This would cover about 90% of material and equip-
ment supplies and 70% of civil works.
Disbursements
3.24       Disbursements of the proposed Credit would cover:
(a) civil works, 100% of foreign expenditures and 40% of
local expenditures (including small contracts under LCB);
(b) material and equipment contracts, 100% of foreign expendi-
tures (c.i.f. cost) for directly imported goods, or 100%
of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured
goods, or 60% of local expenditures for goods procured locally;
and
(c) consulting services, 100% of total expenditures.
A quarterly disbursement forecast is shown in Annex 7. The closing date
of the Credit would be December 31, 1985.
3.25       Disbursements in respect of small contracts under LCB 1/ would be
made against statements of expenditures with the supporting documentation
retained by WSSB and held available for review during the course of project
supervision. Disbursement for all other items will be fully documented.
Advances drawn from PPF with the service charge accrued thereon, will be
repaid out of the proceeds of the proposed Credit as soon as it is declared
effective.
1/   In the past, WSSB has contracted reasonably small lots of pipe laying to
persons with experience in pipe fitting. These persons hire the labor
force and WSSB carries out the required supervision. This "work-team"
system has proved to be an effective and economical way of laying minor
water mains.

IV. THE BENEFICIARY
The Water Supply and Sewerage Board (WSSB)
4.01      WSSB, the Beneficiary, was created under the "Drinking Water Supply
and Sewerage Board (Constitution) Order 1973". Under this order the Board is
entitled to construct and operate drinking water and sewerage projects in areas
specified by HMG. More specifically it performs the following functions:
(a) undertake surveys and designs for water supply and sewer-
age projects;
(b) undertake all activities connected with procurement;
(c) personnel training;
(d) appoint staff and, if necessary, select consultants;
(e) formulate policies relating to water supply and sewerage
in WSSB's supply area which, after approval by HMG, gain
legal force;
(f) prepare annual and five-year budgets; and
(g) carry out all other functions necessary for proper project
execution and operation of systems.
4.02      WSSB reports to the Government through MWPI.  The Board of WSSB
has seven members under the Chairmanship of the Secretary, MWPI. The other
members represent the Ministries of Finance, Home and Panchayat, and Health,
the Secretariat of the National Planning Commission, and the Department of
Water Supply and Sewerage. WSSB's Project-in-Charge (general manager) is a
Board Member ex-officio and also functions as the Board's Secretary.
4.03      Although conceived as a semi-autonomous Board with considerable
independence, WSSB in fact functions as a Government department charged with
the responsibility of carrying out Government instructions which are not only
concerned with policy decisions but also deal with day-to-day matters. Par-
ticular areas of Government interest are tariffs (this, however, is common in
many countries and reflects the Government's concern for organized development
of all sectors in the economy), personnel and borrowing powers (WSSB is not
permitted to borrow directly abroad but HMG raises the funds and passes them
on to WSSB). Generally, these restrictions have in the past not adversely.
affected project implementation. To gain more independence in future, par-
ticularly with respect to employment of personnel and personnel remuneration,
WSSB's management has been attempting to transform the Board into a Government
corporation, either under a special legislative act or under the umbrella of
the general Corporation Law. This is a worthwhile endeavor to which the
Association does not have any objection.



- 20 -
Organization and Management
4.04      The organization chart for WSSB is shown at Annex 8.  The chief exe-
cutive officer of WSSB is the Project-in-Charge to whom the Board has dele-
gated most of its powers. The incumbent is a capable engineer and manager.
To ensure that this important position is filled with a competent person at
all times, agreement was reached during negotiations to this effect. The
top executives next to the Project-in-Charge are the managers for distribution,
design/construction water supply, design/construction sewerage, and finance.
WSSB is in the process of recruiting a qualified person for manager distribution
whereas the positions of the other managers have been filled. The two con-
struction managers together with their staff will be in charge of implement-
ing the Project. Judging from the encouraging improvement experienced more
recently in the implementation of the two ongoing, IDA-financed projects,
they are capable of carrying out the Project.
4.05      Execution of the earlier projects (Credits 470 and 704-NEP) has
been very slow and cumbersome in the beginning. The main reasons for this
were WSSB's unfamiliarity with international procurement procedures and, more
general, insufficient capability to carry out major works in a well planned
and organized fashion. Furthermore, the first project experienced consider-
able cost overruns, caused by occurences beyond WSSB's control, for which
partial financing had to be provided by IDA through a supplement to Credit
470-NEP (US$4 million equivalent). More recently, however, WSSB has been
able to accelerate noticeably the implementation of its projects. As of
February 29, 1980, about 70% of Credit 470-NEP were disbursed, and, although
about 87% of Credit 704-NEP still remain undisbursed, work is well underway.
Staffing and Training
4.06      WSSB's staff, about 700 at present, has been built up to a satis-
factory level for the present activities. Much credit in this respect goes
to experts financed from funds of the Overseas Development Administration (ODA)
of the United Kingdom who have been working closely with WSSB since the middle
of 1974. They have concentrated on assistance in the fields of general engineer-
ing and project management, finance, leak detection, metering, water production
and laboratory work.
4.07       In Nepal it is difficult to obtain trained professional personnel
in sufficient numbers because the level of schooling is unfortunately inade-
quate. For instance the Nepal Engineering Institute, assisted by IDA through
a Technical Education Credit, has introduced graduate courses for engineers
only about two years ago. The first class of about 24 students will graduate



- 21 -
in 1981. Although this will alleviate the situation as far as the availabil-
ity of professional engineering staff is concerned, there will still be need
for staff training in laboratory work such as general chemistry and microbio-
logy (about 15 staff will be required over the next several years), leak detec-
tion and repair, metering (flow measurement, fault diagnosis and meter calib-
ration) and water distribution. This will be arranged exclusively as in-house
training. The proposed Project includes a provision for scholarships for
senior level staff as well as some training material (para. 3.11) for which
UNDP financing is being sought.
Takeover of Water Operations
4.08      As in the past, WSSB will take over the assets of existing water
supply operations in those parts of the country in which the proposed Project
will be located (in practice the water operations of the Six Towns). These
operations are presently being run either by municipalities (panchayats) or,
in some cases, by WSSD of MWPI. Generally, the takeover formalities have not
created major problems in the past when municipalities were involved; in case
of operations managed by WSSD, however, cumbersome and time consuming nego-
tiations had to be held. Timely takeover is important for proper project
execution as welL as operation.  HMG has agreed that any takeover of assets
and operations of any town to be included in the area covered by the proposed
Project will be completed before start-up of physical project implementation
in the respective township.
Water and Sewerage Regulations
4.09      Satisfactory water regulations have been issued which, inter alia,
allow WSSB to provide water supply in an orderly fashion, to enter premises
for the purpose of carrying out construction and maintenance work, and to
charge for the services. WSSB is presently in the process of amending some
of the technical stipulations of the regulations in order to bring them in
line with current requirements in the country.
4.10      Acceptable draft sewerage regulations have been prepared by WSSB
which, after they have come into force,will form the legal basis for all
aspects of operation of the sewer systems as well as for levying sewerage
charges. They are a basic requirement for WSSB's operation in the sewerage
sub-sector. It was therefore agreed during negotiations that the proposed
Credit would become effective only after the sewerage regulations have
come into force.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Background
5.01      Credit 704-NEP and, later, the EEC Special Action Credit (SAC  26-
NEP)required HMG and WSSB to set tariffs at levels which would cover all of
WSSB's operating, administrative and maintenance expenses as well as asset
depreciation during FYs 77 and 78. Expectations were that during FYs 79-82 a
rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets in operation of 2% would
be achieved which could be raised to 3% in FY83 and 4% in FY84 rising grad-
ually to 6% in FY87 and thereafter. These financial performance targets
were developed on the basis of the following criteria:
(a) major portions of the source and distribution works, partic-
ularly those associated with the first project, would be
completed by FY78 and would provide adequate service to a
much larger group of customers than before;
(b) due to the availability of sufficient water, WSSB could under-
take a substantial customer connection program;
(c) WSSB would be able to raise tariffs gradually in FYs 77 and
78 preparing the ground for a necessary and large tariff
adjustment in FY79 when improved water service was available;
and
(d) charges for sewerage services could be introduced by FY79
when it was estimated that partial sewage disposal systems
would be commissioned in Kathmandu and Bhaktapur.
5.02      Up to FY78, WSSB has been able to reach modest rates of return of
about 1% 1/. This, although no tariff adjustment was made since January 15,
1975 when tariffs were increased by about 60%. Since FY79, however, a deter-
iorating trend has emerged which has the following main reasons:
(a) delay in implementation of the first project (470-NEP)
postponed accrual of the project benefits in the water
supply as well as sewerage sub-sectors;
(b) WSSB has been proceeding only cautiously with connecting
new customers due so far to inadequate service; and
(c)  despite representations by the Association, HMG and WSSB
have been reluctant to adjust tariffs claiming that no such
adjustments should be made before much improved service was
available.
1/   On non-revalued assets.  Had asset revaluation been applied, WSSB would
not have covered its operating expenses including depreciation.



- 23 -
5.03      It is evident from the above that maintenance of WSSB's financial
viability (cost coverage through revenues) will require substantial tariff
increases as well as an organized and efficient customer connection program.
Tariffs
5.04      WSSB, with the assistance of a consultant, has recently undertaken
a tariff study 1/. This study, which will form the basis for future tariff
considerations and adjustments, was initiated because WSSB's tariff and its
structure, which is still in force, was established in 1975 when only very
limited information and operating experience was available. Most importantly,
however, it was to establish the cost of water and, in certain areas, sewerage
service in the light of the rates of return to be achieved (para. 5.01) vis-a-vis
the consumers' ability to pay in general and with respect to minimum serv-
ices for the very poor through a heavily subsidized "lifeline rate" within
the tariff structure.
5.05      The conclusions of the study can be summarized as follows.  In
order to achieve gradually the covenanted rate of return of 6% on average net
fixed assets in operation, tariffs must be introduced which, on average, would
require payments which would amount to about 5% of family income. In the areas
of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur families would have to set aside consider-
ably larger portions of their income. Particularly those families whose income
levels are within the lowest 25% range 2/ (about 40% to 60% of all households)
would be affected to a considerable degree and would, for instance, have to
spend up to 12% of their income for water in Bhaktapur. Although data on the
six additional towns (para. 2.01) have not been included in the tariff study,
it can be concluded that similar percentages, probably in the higher range,
would also apply there.
5.06      The conclusions of the tariff study concerning affordability alone
(paras. 5.04 and 5.05) indicate that the existing tariff covenant (para. 5.01)
should not be maintained without modification. Additional reasons which make
it advisable to lower the financial targets are:
(a) past projects concentrated on urban areas while the proposed
project as well as future expansions will supply areas with
a distinctly rural character;
1/   The study was financed from funds of Credit 704-NEP.
2/   Income levels of about NRs 100-NRs 750 per month in a total range of
about NRs 100-NRs 3,000 per month.



- 24 -
(b) the Nepalese population has a low degree of willingness to
pay for water because alternative sources of water supply
are available in many areas.  The fact that this water
may be unsafe is not translated in willingness to pay by the
unsuspecting population.
5.07      Tariffs should be set at levels the average consumer is able and
willing to pay. It is estimated that this level is about 3% of the average
family income. The tariff structure should keep water affordable for the
very poor segment of the population. Furthermore, it is considered politically
infeasible to raise tariffs immediately to a level equivalent to 3% of
average family income (the present level is about 1.5%) requiring step by
step increases during the next several years.  It was therefore agreed that,
starting FY83, tariffs, including tariffs for sewerage service and HMG
payments for standpipe water (para. 5.10), would be set at levels that cover
WSSB's annual cash operating expenses and depreciation or debt service
including amortization, whichever is higher. As a first step for reaching
this goal, an average tariff increase of not less than 45% is a condition
of credit effectiveness. In FYs 81 and 82 revenues should cover at least
cash operating expenses and depreciation. Gradual tariff adjustments,
presently estimated at about 40% in FY82 and about 25% in FY83 would need
to be made in addition to the initial 45% increase to reach the above
targets.
5.08      The documents of SAC 26-NEP require that tariffs for sewerage ser-
ice amounting to at least 50% of the water charge of any customer with sewer
connection be introduced beginning with the operation of the first phase of
the rehabilitated and extended sewerage system in Kathmandu. However, this
is considered a heavy burden on the consumer, particularly in view of the
simultaneous water tariff increase (para. 5.07), and therefore difficult to
implement in one step from an economic as well as political point of view.
Consequently, agreement was reached that initially a charge of 25Z of the
water charge would be introduced, to be increased to 50% in FY82. Commence-
ment of sewer system operation is expected in fall, 1980.
5.09      The financial targets resulting from the above described tariff
concept do not seem very ambitious since they are aiming for not more than
coverage of cash expenses through revenues. It should be borne in mind how-
ever that even these comparatively low targets require very substantial
tariff increases during the next three years (para. 5.07) which will test
heavily WSSB's commercial sense and HMG's political will. Depending on the
progress of WSSB's actual financial improvements in the future a review of
the financial targets should be made in FY83 with the aim of achieving at
least modest rates of return after FY83.
HMG's Payments for Standpipes
5.10      HMG is paying NRs 100 per month per standpipe to WSSB,thus subsi-
dizing directly the water supply to the poorest segment of the population
within WSSB's supply area. Unfortunately, a dispute has arisen between



-25-
HMG (Ministry of Finance) and WSSB over the level of arrears at stake. As of
end FY79 the amount of the disputed arrears is about NRs 3.8 million. Since
these payments are of major importance for WSSB's finances, HMG and WSSB
have agreed as a condition of Credit effectiveness to verify the level of
arrears based on the present number of standpipes in WSSBts supply area
(including Biratnagar and Birganj) and HMG will appropriate in its FY81
budget the funds necessary to pay all arrears accumulated as of end FY80.
In future, HMG will make timely payments for the total number of standpipes
in WSSB's supply area (including those located in the additional Six Towns).
Connection and Metering Program
5.11      As mentioned before (para. 5.03), WSSB's modest financial perfor-
mance of operating cost coverage through revenues can only be maintained if
an organized and efficient customer connection program for water as well as
sewer connections will be carried out. WSSB has established the following
connection and metering program which takes into account the availability of
additional water, the expected willingness of the public to connect, and WSSB's
capability of carrying out the connections and installing the meters (for more
detail see Annex 2):

The details of the above program, which indicates the minimum of the achiev-
able targets have been agreed.
Onlending Arrangements
5.12      Existing Subsidiary Loan Agreements.  The interest rates stipulated
for the onlending of IDA funds from HMG to WSSB have in the past reflected
largely the cost of capital prevailing at the time the respective IDA Credits



- 26 -
were made (6% for Credit 470-NEP, signed in 1974, and 9% for Credit 704-NEP,
signed in 1977). The Subsidiary Loan Agreement to Credit 470-NEP requires
that the first debt service payment be made in FY79, five years after Credit
effectiveness, to coincide with the expected project completion date. Due to
the delay in implementing the project as well as insufficient tariff levels,
WSSB was not in a position to make the debt service payment in 1979. HMG has
tentatively agreed to postpone the payment to June 30, 1980. The analysis of
WSSB's financial projections (Annex 9) indicates, however, that even after full
operation of the first project and after taking into account the achievable
tariff levels mentioned in paragraphs 5.07 and 5.08, WSSB will not be able to
pay the full debt service before FY83. HMG and WSSB have confirmed their
willingness to modify the Subsidiary Loan Agreement of Credit 470-NEP 1/ so that
the first debt service payment does not fall due before June 30, 1981. The total
annual debt service payments in FYs 81 and 82 will not exceed the amount of
WSSB's annual depreciation allowance. The outstanding debt at the end of FY82
will be paid off in 40 equal semi-annual installments of principal and interest
commencing FY83.
5.13      Onlending Arrangement for the Project.  The rupee equivalent of
the IDA Credit would be passed on to WSSB on terms and conditions similar
to those of the IDA-Credit, but with a 20-year repayment period, after five
years of grace. Conclusion of a satisfactory onlending arrangement is a
condition of Credit effectiveness. This would not set a precedent for the
future. It is expected that WSSB's financial situation will improve and
that unit costs of future projects will be brought down through more
expeditious program implementation. This should allow future borrowing on
more commercial terms.
WSSB's Present and Future Finances
5.14      WSSB's financial situation and future outlook is shown in detail in
Annex 9 and its balance sheet of FY79 is summarized below

While the debt/equity ratio is acceptable in view of WSSB's function as a
water supply utility, receivables are high due to the outstanding payments
for standpipes (para. 5.10), and the very low rate of return as well as the
high operating ratio clearly indicate that the tariff level is insufficient.
5.15      Taking into account the financial criteria explained in the previous

The financing plan clearly shows the effect of a tariff policy which aims at
covering operating cost and debt service through revenues but which in the near
future does not provide sufficient internal cash generation to finance a signi-
ficant portion of WSSB's investment program. During the Project construction
period FYs 81-85, about 18% of HMG's equity contributions are expected to be
financed through foreign capital inflow (US$0.7 million through UNDP funds and
US$3 million equivalent through funds from Credit SAC 26-NEP). In addition,
about US$3.3 million represent the equivalent of the asset value of the Six
Towns to be transferred (para. 4.08) which does not involve monetary trans-
actions.  This leaves a requirement of about US$13.8 million equivalent to
be financed directly from HMG's development budget during the five-year
period FY 81-85, a feasible proposition. Together with the projected payments
for standpipe water (para. 5.10), estimated at US$2.4 million equivalent,
HMG's total budget payments will be about US$16.2 million equivalent. This
amount is counterbalanced by expected debt service payments by WSSB to HMG
of IJS$6.8 million, leaving a net transfer from HMG to WSSB of about US$9.4
million during FYs 81-85.



- 29 -
Accounting, Billing and Collection
5.16      WSSB's accounting system, on accrual basis, was designed by consul-
tants and is working well. No mechanical devices are being used but the manual
accounting procedures used are adequate for WSSB's requirements.
5.17      As of end FY79 WSSB's receivables accounted for 90% of annual
billing (NRs 5.0 million). This appears excessively high. However, NRs 4.1
million represent claims WSSB has against HMG of which about NRs 3.8 million
stem from disputed standpipe payments (para. 5.10). Private receivables do
not exceed three-month billings. This is an acceptable performance enhanced
by WSSB's policy of charging penalties for late payments and small bonuses
for timely and early payment.
Audit
5.18      WSSB's accounts have in the past been audited by professional
accountants appointed by the Auditor-General. The substance of the audit is
acceptable. However, WSSB has not been able to submit to the Association the
unqualified audit report within the stipulated period of six months after the
close of any fiscal year mainly because it was unable to obtain reconciled
account balances from the Government authorities in time. The standard audit
covenant with a six-month submission period would apply with the understanding
that the draft report (before account reconciliation) would be acceptable.
Insurance
5.19      In accordance with a requirement of SAC 26-NEP, WSSB was to establish
an insurance program for its assets-in-operation. As a consequence WSSB took
out liability insurance for its vehicles but, in line with other Government
undertakings, would prefer to follow the principle of self-insurance with HMG
providing the funds for major damage if it occurred. This concept is acceptable
within the standard insurance covenant.
VI. JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solution
6.01      Until recently water in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara has been
supplied from surface sources, rivers and springs through various types of
intake structures. In the Valley these sources are already used to their max-
imum capacity so that a larger scale extension to meet future demands would
require construction of dam(s), transmission mains and full scale treatment
plants. The recent well drillings and further investigations suggest that
wellfields can be developed close to the demand areas at reasonable costs.
Corresponding alternatives have been studied and the development of wellfields



- 30 -
turned out to be the least cost solution at a discount rate of 10%.  Incre-
mental cost of a wellfield would be only half or less of a new surface source.
Furthermore groundwater can be developed most economically in a phased manner
and more readily than surface schemes in the Valley.
6.02       In Pokhara the proposed groundwater wellfield is located close to
the existing primary distribution system. There are other surface sources
available in addition to those constructed under the first project but they
are located a long distance away from the system (Sethi Khola and its tribu-
taries) or require full scale treatment (Phewa Lake).  Consequently, it is
obvious that the development of the groundwater sources is the most feasible
solution at this stage.
6.03      The schemes in other provincial towns include only improvements to
existing river/spring intakes or drilling new wells in the Terai. Due to the
nature of these schemes and the generally adequate availability of water, there
are no practical alternatives. Primary network configuration alternatives
have been analyzed as to their capacity to meet peak flow requirements and
compared on the basis of operational costs and the recommended systems represent
the least cost solutions. Because it is not economical to stage the construc-
tion of relatively small size mains,the distribution system alternatives that
were selected are sized for the year 2000 flows.
Internal Rate of Return
6.04       In calculating the internal rate of return on the Project, the
following assumptions have been used:
(a)  the cost of the Project net of duties and taxes, expressed in
constant 1980 prices. Foreign equipment and material costs
were expressed in c.i.f. terms. The local component of the
Project cost as well as the incremental costs for operation
and maintenance were converted to border prices using the
standard conversion factor of 0.75. The labor component,
which is estimated at about 30% of local costs, was valued
at 70% of market price; and
(b)  the incremental revenues accruing as a result of investments
under the Project have been valued at WSSB's retail tariffs
increased to represent about 3% of today's average family income (para.5.07).
They also include HMG's payments for standpipe water (para.
5.10) and revenues for sewerage service from customers with
sewer connections.
6.05       The rate of return on the Project based on the above assumptions
is about 3%.
6.06       The comparatively low rate of return reflects the fact that using
revenues as a proxy for benefits disregards all additional social benefits
associated with water supply such as improvements to public health, increased



- 31 -
land values in improved neigborhoods, and reduced risks to tourism resulting
from outbreaks of disease and, consequently, understates the return on invest-
ment to a considerable degree. It is, however, within the acceptable range
of returns in a socially oriented sector. Furthermore, it is a clear indica-
tion that WSSB's tariffs, even after the considerable increases required to
achieve the covenanted tariff levels (para. 5.07) are well below the average
incremental cost of service (AIC). The tariff study mentioned in paragraph
5.04 has established that AIC based on WSSB's investment program for the
Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Biratiagar and Birganj and using a discount rate
of 10% amounts to NRs J.44 per m of water sales for water supply and sewer-
age and NRS 2.36 per m for water sales alone. This compares to about
NRs 0.83 m  of revenues for water 3alone after introduction of the 45% tariff
increase and about NRs 1.25 per m if tariffs amounting to about 3% of average
family income were charged. HMG and WSSB have indicated their intention to
apply a block 5ariff structure in future which features a low cost block for
the first 10 m per household and month, as is the case now, but to charge
tariffs much closer to AIC for any additional consumption. This is an accept-
able principle.
Project Benefits
6.07      As mentioned above (para. 6.06) the internal rate of return does not
fully reflect the benefits which accrue from improvements to water supply and
sanitation systems because they cannot readily be quantified. The important
ones are:
(a) the provision of water, especially in provincial towns,
relieves a significant manpower input (mainly by women),
presently occupied with transporting water, for productive
functions (in the Terai mainly for farming). This could
significantly improve family income of households in the
lower income brackets;
(b) the provision of water will stimulate industrial development
(Biratnagar, Birganj, Hetauda) and will benefit the economy
of all provincial towns which are important trading centers
thus creating additional employment opportunities;
(c) especially in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara, the improved
environmental quality and health conditions through improved
water supply will have significant impact on the growth of
tourism which in   turn increases employment opportunities
for the members of lower income groups.   In Kathmandu the
extended sewerage system will greatly improve the cleanliness
of the central areas heavily visited by tourists; and



- 32 -
(d) it is evident that the poor standard of water supply in
towns is the main cause for the high prevalence of water
borne diseases (para. 1.04). The use of safe water will
result in improved sanitation thus reducing health care
costs and improving productivity.
6.08      On the above basis, the high priority given to the development of
the water and sanitation sector is well justified. As an additional factor,
it can be mentioned that through the Project IDA would continue its assistance
to WSSB in developing its institutional capability.
Impact on Poverty Groups
6.09      The lower income population resides mainly in the environs of the
towns (fringe villages). The estimated absolute poverty income level (August
1979) for Nepal is NRs 595 per household per month (annual US$85 per capita)
for urban areas and NRs 280 per household per month for rural areas (annual
US$40 per capita) using seven persons per household on average. The table
below illustrates the proportion of population of some project towns below
the above urban poverty income limit and compares it with the proportion of
present population served through standpipes:
Population below       Population Served
Poverty Income        Through Standpipes
Level %                    g
Kathmandu                47                       48
Lalitpur                 60                       48
Pokhara                  63                       63
Biratnagar               55                       78
Birganj                  51                       23
Bhaktapur                68                       70
The above comparison indicates that the population below the poverty line use
mainly standpipes.  In small provincial towns where the situation is worse,
more than 60% of the served population rely on standpipes.
6.10      In view of the above, HMG's policy to pay for the supply through
standpipes is appropriate for ensuring the minimum level of safe water supply
to the lower income groups of the population. The number of standpipes
will increase especially in the additional Six Towns and will help
significantly to supply a larger portion of the low-income population.



- 33 -
6.11      The fee for obtaining a private house connection is reasonably low,
currently NRs 70. There are indications that people also in lower income
brackets are willing to pay this in order to obtain at least a courtyard tap.
It is therefore desirable to keep the connection fee as low as possible.
Project Risks
6.12      WSSB has significantly improved its project implementation capacity
in recent years gaining experience through working with international consul-
tants. Furthermore, in-house training is taking place for sub-professional
staff assisted by ODA advisors and more engineering staff will be available
from diploma courses arranged by the Nepal Engineering Institute. However,
since WSSB will rather rapidly take over new provincial systems, it may
occasionally face staffing problems. However, this is not believed to create
a critical long-term problem. It is also expected that future bid invitations
should attract more competitive offers than in the past, particularly from
India, as many project works are reasonably close to the Indian border in the
Terai. It is likely that the local contractors will successfully participate
in bidding for civil works.
6.13      In the past,HMG has demonstrated a great reluctance to permit tariff
adjustments. This may not apply so much to the initial 45% tariff increase
(para. 5.07) as to the increases required during the following years to achieve
the necessary financial targets. In order to minimize all risks associated
with the Project, close supervision is, however, required. To keep project
supervision at manageable levels and to ensure that WSSB will receive the
maximum benefit from such supervision, the existing monitoring system will be
improved so as to permit continuous scrutiny of project implementation and
institutional development
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Conditions of Effectiveness
7.01      Before the proposed credit is declared effective, HMG and/or WSSB
would:
(a)  make satisfactory arrangements for the employiment of
engineerine consultants (para. 3.15);
(b)  introduce sewerage regulations (nara. 4.10);
(c) enact an average tariff increase of 45% (para. 5.07);
(d) verify the number of standpipes in WSSB's supply area and
appropriate sufficient funds to pay for the arrears related
to water standpipes (para. 5.10); and
(e) make satisfactory onlending arrangement (Dara. 5.13).



- 34 -
Other Assurances
7.02      During negotiations, agreements were reached with HMG and WSSB
on the following major points:
(a) land acquisition (para. 3.18);
(b) appointment of a qualified person to the position of
Project-in-Charge (para. 4.04);
(c) takeover of water operations (para. 4.08);
(d) levels of tariffs and standpipe payments (paras. 5.07,
5.08 and 5.10);
(e)  connection and metering program (para. 5.11); and
(f)  onlending arrangements (para. 5.12).
Recommendation
7.03      The Project constitutes a suitable basis for an Association Credit
of US$27 million equivalent on standard terms.

Notes to table:
(a) Nos. of connections as of 7/15/79 are actual.
(b) Water supply assets in Biratnagar and BirganJ are taken over during Fl1980.
(c)  Metering of the existing unmetered connections is expected to be completed by 7/15/82 in Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and
Biratnagar and by 7/15/83 in Birganj.
(d) Water supply assets in six additional towns are expected to be taken over by 7/15/81.
(e)  Metering of unmetered connections will be done during FY1983, 1981 and 1985.
(f) Metering program is adjusted in such a way that in Kathmandu/Lalitpur the installation rate will not exceed 500 installations
per month and in provincial towns 80 installations per month (in six towns the rate will be less than 40 installations per
month.

ANNEX 9

NEPAL
THIRD WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
Water and Sewer Connections
1.       The revenues are based on the customer connection program included
in Annex 2, averaged toallow for gradual increases during the years.  This
program, which was established by WSSB and reviewed by the Association,
includes minimum targets which, if increased, would result in additional
revenues.
Water Losses
2.       At present, only about 2/3 of WSSB's customers (private connections)
are metered, the standpipe supply is entirely unmetered and metering at source
is being done only in very few places. Furthermore, the systems are only part
of the time under pressure which makes leak detection very difficult. Conse-
quently, the quantities of unaccounted for water can only be estimated. The
consultants have assumed that, on an average, system losses account at present
for about 60% of production. Ongoing work of the leak detection squads, the
progressive metering of supplies together with system rehabilitation should
result in improvements which have been assumed to reduce losses by 2% to 4%
per year during the next several years.
Revenues and Tariffs
3.       Water revenues have been calculated on the basis of the demand
projections made by the consultants corrected to take into account WSSB's
customer connection program. Revenues from sewerage service in Kathmandu
and Bhaktapur have been assumed to accrue from fall 1980 onwards when sewerage
service is expected to be available.
4.       The revenue calculations start with the present tariff levels
(see page 7).  In line with the proposed-flnancialrcovenant Th efollowing
tariff increases havebeen assumed:
45% in September 1980/
41% in July 1981
26% in July 1982
11% in July 1983
20% in July 1985
These increases (after that of September 1980), particularly their timing
and magnitude, depend heavily on the actual trend inflation will develop
in future, on the rate at which WSSB will be able to implement its projects,
and on WSSB's ability to connect new customers.
1/ Condition of Credit effectiveness.

5.       Tariffs for sewerage service have been projected at 50% (25% in FY81)
of the water tariffs for those customers having sewer connections. They
increase at the same rate as the water connections. Similarly, HMG's payments
for standpipes start at the present rate of NRs 100 per standpipe and per month
and increase in step with the general water tariff increases.
Asset Takeover
6.       The assets of Birgani were taken over by WSSB in February 1980.
It has been assumed that takeover of the Six Towns will occur simultaneously
in July 1981. The value of the assets taken over were established by the
consultants in their feasibility studies for the Six Towns.
Asset Accrual
7.       In accordance with WSSB's practice, assets are transferred from
"work in progress" to "assets in operation" at the time of completion of a
project in a certain town. To simplify matters, transfer of assets of the
first two projects have been assumed to occur in FY81 and FY82 (50% each)
for the first project and in FYs 82 and 83 for the second project. The third
project indicates transfers in FYs 83 and 85.
Depreciation
8.       The following depreciation rates (major items) are being used by
WSSB:
Type of Asset                          Rate of Depreciation
Civil Engineering Works                         2%
Plant and Equipment                             5%
Meters and Other Small Equipment               10%
Vehicles                                       20%
For the purpose of the projections an average rate of 2.7% has been applied.
In accordance with WSSB's practice, depreciation has not been prorated. Full
depreciation allowance has been made in the fiscal year following plant
commissioning.
Operaring and Administration Expenses
9.       Starting with the actual FY79 expenses and using WSSB's FY80 budget,
operating expenses were increased in proportion to the expanding operations.
An annual price escalation of 8% has been assumed. The operating expenses
for the additional Six Towns have been based on the estimates of the consultant's
feasibility study. Administration costs have been estimated in a similar way.
Fixed Assets
10.      WSSB's fixed assets are recorded at cost.  No asset revaluation has
been assumed.

HMG Equity
11.      This item represents the accumulated net value of assets transferred
from HMG . WSSB.  All transfers are made in the form of equity.
HMG Contribution
12.      HMG's contributions represent the counterpart funds HMG contributes
for financing the portion of projects not financed by IDA credit.
Borrowing and Debt Service
13.      WSSB's total borrowing consists of HMG's loans for IDA credits
470-NEP and 704-NEP and of the proposed credit. In line with the covenant
aiming at adjusting the debt service to WSSB's earnings position, amortization
and interest of the first loan (470-NEP) have been adjusted so as not to
exceed depreciation in FYs 81 and 82. Investments beyond the third project
have been assumed to be financed at 85% by future loans. These loans would
have a grace period on iterest and amortization of 5 years.
