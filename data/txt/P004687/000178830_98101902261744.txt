REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND FOR A SECOND
TELECOMMUNICATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Telephone Organization of Thailand, with the guarantee of the
Kingdom of Thailand, for the equivalent of US$26 million to help finance
the Second Telecommunications Project. The loan would have a term of 20
years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Thailand Current Economic Prospects and Selected
Development Issues" (924-TH) was distributed under cover of Secretary's Memo-
randum (M75-799) dated November 20, 1975, to the Executive Directors and to
members of the Consultative Group for Thailand. Basic data are given in
Annex I.
Recent Political Events
3.        The Government of Dr. Sanya Dhammasakdi, which came to power
after the overthrow of the military government of Field Marshalls Thanom and
Prapass, successfully adopted a new democratic constitution in October 1974
and held elections in January 1975. After the elections, in which 22 parties
won seats, M. R. Kukrit Pramoj, leader of the Social Action Party, put to-
gether a minority coalition government of four centrist parties in the
elected assembly. This coalition agreed on a policy statement emphasizing
the need to correct inequalities between rural and urban areas and between
different income classes. Its major domestic policy actions towards achiev-
ing this objective were: (a) decentralization of some government expendi-
tures to rural areas through direct transfers of funds to tambons (village
councils); (b) adoption of price guarantees for rice and sugar; and (c) sub-
stantially increased budget expenditures in FY76 for social and economic
development programs. In late December 1975 the Kukrit Government increased
the controlled retail prices of rice and sugar to bring them into line with
the minimum guaranteed prices previously announced for the current paddy
and sugarcane crops. When this action was challenged by the parliamentary
opposition, the Prime Minister requested H.M. The King to dissolve Parliament.
Elections were held on April 4; the Democratic Party, led by Seni Pramoj
(Kukrit's elder brother) won 115 of the 279, Seni Pramoj was chosen to be the
new Prime Minister and formed a four party coalition Government on April 21st.
The economic policies of the new Government are not likely to depart signi-
ficantly from the previous administration's policies.

- 2 -
4.        The international environment altered dramatically soon after
establishment of the Kukrit Government with changes in the political control
of Cambodia, Laos and South Viet Nam. In adjusting to these changes the
Government has secured the agreement of the United States to withdraw its
remaining forces in Thailand this year, established diplomatic and trade
relations with China and Cambodia, received diplomatic delegations from
South Viet Nam and North Viet Nam, and exercised restraint in responding
to diplomatic incidents with Laos while pursuing a normalization of
relations.
Current Economic Situation
5.        Thailand's real GDP expanded at an average rate of 8 percent
during the 1960s with agriculture growing by 5-1/2 percent per year; prices
were virtually stable; open unemployment was minimal; and the balance of
payments was in surplus. Recent years have been more difficult, however.
In the period 1970-75 performance has been mixed, and for the period as a
whole growth has slowed to about 6 percent as a result of stagnation of
private and public investment in the early 1970s, and adverse weather and
slow progress in intensification of agricultural production which reduced
agriculture's growth to 4 percent a year. In 1973-74 dramatic improvements
in international markets and prices of agricultural commodities raised
Thailand's export earnings by 150 percent. This export boom stimulated a
rapid expansion of demand, production, and private investment and generated
balance of payments surpluses that enabled Thailand to adjust to higher
prices of imported petroleum with less difficulty than most other develop-
ing countries. At the same time, domestic prices increased rapidly, largely
as a result of massive increases in both import and export prices. Since
the summer of 1974, however, the strong stimulus from the external trade
sector has faded as export commodity prices declined while import prices
continued to rise. Consequently, the growth of demand decelerated, the
expansion of manufacturing output slowed, and significant open unemployment
appeared. Part of the new capacity created in the 1973-74 private invest-
ment boom remained underutilized; and excess capacity, together with the
international recession and political uncertainty, caused private invest-
ment to decline in 1975. Still, real growth in 1975 was about 6 percent as
a result of the Government's expansionary fiscal policy (which raised public
expenditure by about 25 percent) and good weather. Slower demand growth and
smaller import price increases also held the rate of inflation to about 4
percent. Assuming normal weather, real GDP should grow by another 6 percent
in 1976, although private investment is likely to continue to be depressed
for at least the first half of the year.
Structural Problems
6.        Thailand's favorable performance during the last decade was not
without weaknesses. Income disparities between regions and between rural
and urban areas are substantial as Bangkok and the Central Region have
developed more rapidly than the rest of the country. The population
has continued to grow by about 3 percent per year. As a result of past
and present population growth, the annual increment to the labor force
has risen by more than 50 percent in the last decade, the dependency ratio



- 3 -
is high, and the burden on the Government to provide education, health,
and other necessary services is heavy. In the past, agricultural output
increased largely because new land was put under cultivation rather than
because productivity increased. However, evidence has now accumulated
that the supply of new land is being exhausted; population pressure on
land has already developed in some areas; and tenancy problems are becoming
more serious than in the past. Expansion of area under cultivation also
provided jobs for about half the new entrants to the labor force, as indus-
trial employment has grown slowly and still accounts for only 7 percent
of the work force. In the future, as free land suitable for cultivation
is exhausted, creating new jobs will be more difficult as they will have
to be generated by the intensification of agricultural production and the
rapid expansion of labor intensive industries.
Progress Toward Development Objectives & Recent Institutional Changes
7.        Thailand's Third Five-Year Plan (1972-76) attempted to deal with
the above structural problems. It included the following objectives:
reducing regional and rural-urban income disparities, increasing employ-
ment, intensification of agricultural production, and greater public ex-
penditure on education and other social services. Progress towards these
objectives was minimal under the Thanom-Prapass regime. The Sanya and
Kukrit Governments, however, have taken a number of steps directed towards
achieving these objectives. Public expenditures for education, health and
social services have almost doubled and expenditures on agriculture almost
tripled in the period FY73-FY76. The Government's price policy in agri-
culture has allowed domestic agricultural prices to rise with international
prices, and the real per capita income of the 75 percent of the population
that is dependent on agriculture rose by about one-third over the last four
years. Through the tambon program $125 million was transferred to village
councils in FY75 to finance rural public works and create off-farm employ-
ment and income. In the last two years, laws have also been passed to re-
form agricultural land ownership, tenancy, and rents and to establish a
Marketing Organization for Farmers and a Farmers' Aid Fund. However, for-
mulation of-detailed programs to implement many of these measures is still
necessary, and only the implementation will determine whether or not these
promising first steps lead to lasting results.
Development Prospects and the Fourth Plan (1977-1981)
8.        Recent events have complicated long-term planning, and work on
the Fourth Five Year Plan (1977-81) is not yet far advanced. The Govern-
ment presented a general policy statement and a preliminary project list
to a meeting of the Consultative Group for Thailand in December 1975. The
preliminary outline of the Fourth Plan reflects the emphasis which recent
governments have put on reducing social and economic disparities between
regions, income groups, and urban and rural areas. In order to achieve its
distributional objectives, Thailand must also adopt policies and programs
to accelerate growth to at least the 7 percent target announced at the
meeting. Generating a growth rate of 7 percent or higher is necessary for
two reasons. First, the progressive exhaustion of free land will limit
agriculture's capacity to absorb workers in the countryside; and, if growing



- 4 -
rural unemployment is not to worsen the pattern of income distribution,
employment opportunities in other sectors will have to expand rapidly.
Second, if, for instance, GDP were to continue to grow at 5 percent (the
average over 1974 and 1975) average real per capita income would rise only
very slowly, given annual population increases of 2.5-3 percent and
declining terms of trade.
9.        A greater effort than in the past will, however, be required
in order to achieve the above target. Political and economic uncertainty
will restrain private investment, particularly foreign investment, at
least in the early years of the Plan. Agricultural production increases,
improvements in rural incomes, and growth in agricultural exports will
have to be generated by raising yields rather than by extending the area
under cultivation. An ambitious public expenditure program will be neces-
sary to satisfy priority economic and social needs and support rapid employ-
ment growth. Substantial effort will be necessary to mobilize the domestic
resources required to finance the needed level of public expenditures.
Finally, the availability of foreign exchange could also become a serious
constraint to growth later in the decade, when Thailand's balance of pay-
ments position will be less favorable than it has been in the recent past.
Balance of Payments and External Borrowing Program
10.       Although Thailand's import bill doubled between 1972 and 1974,
higher export earnings and private capital inflows were sufficient to meet
foreign exchange requirements in this period and increased reserves to six
months imports. In 1975, however, the overall balance of payments was in
deficit by about $100 million as the terms of trade (which began declining
in mid-1974) deteriorated further, overseas demand weakened due to the inter-
national recession, and a smaller volume of agricultural commodities was ex-
ported due to poor weather in the previous year. The turnaround in the
balance of payments reflects the transition from a period of rapid growth in
export earnings, led by unusually high commodity prices, to a period of
smaller increases. This situation is likely to continue for the remainder of
the decade, and rising import levels required to maintain a large investment
program in the Fourth Plan will lead to a large external resource gap.
11.       A marked increase in the use of external capital for financing
public investment, which was relatively low in the past, will be necessary
to provide needed foreign exchange. At the last Consultative Group meeting
the Government indicated that it was seeking about $3,500 million in loan
commitments to finance its investment program in the Fourth Plan. It also
plans to borrow an additional $600 million from private sources and has just
raised the first $100 million of this amount. Thailand's total debt service
ratio has dropped from 18 percent in 1971 to below 12 percent in 1975 (of
which just over two percentage points are public debt service) and would
remain under 15 percent throughout the Fourth Plan. With the projected level
of borrowing, public debt service payments would not place an unreasonable
burden on the balance of payments provided the debt is incurred on reasonable
terms. However, because of the limited availability of official development
assistance and long term private capital, the Government may encounter some
difficulty in achieving this level of borrowing.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
12.       Thailand first borrowed from the Bank in 1950 and has received
31 loans amounting $708.1 million, net of cancellations. Most of these have
been transportation ($186.1 million), irrigation ($164.1 million) and power
($166.0 million) with, in addition, one for a dual-purpose power and irriga-
tion project ($65.8 million). The remaining loans have been for water supply
($55.0 million), telecommunications ($37.0 million), education ($21.4 million),
and industry ($13.0 million). Two loans on Third Window terms for rural
development ($21.0 million) and livestock ($5.0 million) have been signed,
though not yet effective. A loan for rubber replanting ($50.0 million) has
been approved but not yet signed. In addition, Thailand has received IDA
credits of $19.5 million for education and $12.5 million for irrigation
improvement. In general, Bank-financed projects have been carried out in
accordance with expectations; the Third Education Project (Credit 369-TH) has
begun to show substantial progress in contracting civil works and equipment
and furniture. Under the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 898-TH), the borrower is
slowly overcoming its financial difficulties. Under the Fifth Highway Project
(Loan 870-TH) work is being resumed on roads for which earlier contracts were
terminated due to inadequate cost escalation provisions. The Bangkok Water
Supply Project (Loan 1021-TH) after initial delays in evaluation, has completed
bidding and award of most of the tunnel contracts. Annex II contains a
summary statement of IFC investment; Bank loans and IDA credits as of
March 31,1976, as well as notes on the execution of on-going projects.
13.       The Bank is diversifying its lending program in Thailand.    In the
next few years a smaller proportion of lending is planned for transportation
and power projects, while projects to support a broad range of agriculture
development, rural works and infrastructure, family planning, education and
small and medium-scale industries would account for about two-thirds of the
proposed program. Increasingly, projects are being selected to spread dev-
elopment benefits outside the Central Plains area, and one of the main
functions of the Bank's Regional Mission in Bangkok is to assist the Govern-
ment in developing projects which will achieve this. Our readiness to finance
some local costs in appropriate cases will enable the Bank to participate more
fully in projects in agriculture and the social sectors which would have
significant social benefits.
14.       In FY76, about 90 percent, by dollar amounts, of projects proposed
for Bank lending-are expected to benefit the country-side, where most low
low income people live. An irrigation project in the northern region was
approved in July 1975, rural development and livestock projects were approved
in January 1976 and a loan for an accelerated rubber replanting project was
approved in April 1976. In addition to the proposed Second Telecommunications
Project, which is the subject of this report, a loan for an education project
designed to benefit mostly the rural population is scheduled to be presented
to the Executive Directors later this fiscal year or in early FY77.



- 6 -
15.       On March 31, 1976, Bank loans and IDA credits disbursed and
outstanding amounted to $313.5 million, representing about 22 percent of
the country's estimated total external debt and about 47 percent of public
external debt. This exposure is not excessive in view of Thailand's modest
overall public external debt (about 4.2 percent of GDP in 1975). In addi-
tion, although the level of Bank commitments is expected to increase over
the next five years, the Bank Group's exposure is expected to decline rapidly
to about 16 percent of total external debt and 26 percent of total public
external debt. Servicing of the Bank debt in 1980 is projected to account
for about 8.2 percent of the total debt service and about 34 percent of the
country's public debt service; this compares with 8.4 percent and 43 percent
respectively in 1975.
16.       IFC has made two equity investments in the Industrial Finance Cor-
poration of Thailand totalling $380,000, two loans to and an investment in
the Siam Cement group totalling $32.08 million, and a loan of $300,000 to
Concrete Products Ltd. Prospects for other IFC operations are reasonably
good; potential projects include a pulp and paper project based on bamboo and
bagasse, a zinc mining and refinery project, and the development of privately
sponsored industrial estates. The Capital Markets Department is considering
an investment in a mutual fund management company and has been invited to
assist in housing finance.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Sector Organization
17.       The public telecommunications facilities in Thailand are state-
owned. While the Post and Telegraphs Department (PTD) of the Ministry of
Communications is responsible for telegraph, telex and all international
telecommunications, the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), a state
enterprise under the same ministry, is responsible for management, operation
and development of local and long distance telephone services. Both TOT and
PTD have plans for large scale expansion of all telecommunications services in
Thailand and close coordination between the two will be essential to ensure
orderly and economic planning and efficient operations. At present this is
handled through a joint TOT/PTD Committee which has worked reasonably well.
The Government and TOT will review and as necessary strengthen the existing
arrangements for coordinating the developmental and operational activities of
agencies concerned with public telecommunications facilities including the
joint TOT/PTD Committee. (See section 4.04 of draft loan agreement and section
3.03 of the draft guarantee agreement.)
Local Telephone Services
18.      Compared with some other countries in the region, the quality and
quantity of telephone services in Thailand are poor. The telehone density
in the country is 0.76 telephones installed per 100 population which is low
compared to 2.21 in Malaysia and 1.09 in Philippines. About eighty percent



- 7 -
of the country's telephones are installed in Bangkok, which has only 11 per-
cent of the country's population; yet Bangkok's telephone density is only
5.5 telephones per 100 population against 22.8 in Hong Kong, 21.7 in Manila,
and 12.5 in Singapore. The telephone density in the rural areas is exception-
ally low at 0.2 telephone per 100 population; also many areas in the hinter-
land are without any telephone access at all.
19.      As of September 30, 1975 the local telephone network had an installed
capacity of 263,350 lines. It is equipped with modern crossbar type automatic
exchanges except for 20,000 lines of old step-by-step equipment and 10,450
lines in manual exchanges. Moreover, some of the cables, wires and intruments
are physically obsolete, causing excessive faults. Fifty-three percent of
all attempts by subscribers are unsuccessful, mainly due to inadequate ex-
change capacity, shortage of working lines, faulty cable and defective tele-
phone sets.
Trunk Services
20.      All major centers of the country are provided with backbone trunk
routes through high capacity micro-wave, UHF and VHF radio systems. However,
the service is subject to heavy delays (average 1 - 4 hours) due largely to
inadequate number of long distance circuits (installed capacity in the system
is not being utilized due to lack of complementary equipment) and lack of
terminating equipment and manual boards for operating the circuits. About 15%
of calls booked are subsequently cancelled by subscribers because of unaccept-
able delays. The inadequacy of trunk service affects most adversely the rural
areas which depend on telephone service to obtain administrative, commercial,
health and other services from nearby towns.
Demand for Telephone Service
21.      As of September 30, 1975, the total telephone demand (defined as
the sum of working lines and estimated unsatisfied demand) was assessed at
479,100 lines of which the working lines were only 218,900. In Bangkok,
against a total demand of 309,700 there were only 170,300 working lines. In
rural areas, against a total demand of 169,400 the working lines were a mere
48,600.
22.      TOT has forecast the total demand to increase to about 687,000 by
FY79, at an annual growth rate of 9-1/2 percent as against the 10-15 percent
prevailing in other developing countries. Even with this assessment and
despite a planned 66 percent increase in installed capacity during FY76-79,
the unsatisfied demand for new telephone connections in the country is expected
to rise from 260,200 at the end of FY75 to 273,500 at the end of FY79, an
increase of 5 percent. Whereas in Bangkok the increase in unsatisfied demand
is expected to be 1 percent, during the same period, in rural areas it will be
nearer 10 percent because of increased economic and developmental activity and
because additional demand builds up in areas being provided with telephone
service for the first time. TOT's development program is, therefore, modest
in scope in relation to the anticipated demand.



-8-
Sector Constraints
23.      The telecommunications sector in Thailand has been developing with-
out government budget support or local borrowings for capital investment.
Consequently, expansion of domestic telephone services has been tied to
TOT's capacity to generate funds from internal sources and to borrow external-
ly rather than by TOT's capacity to carry out a large investment program.
The average annual capital investment during the years FY72-75 was only
$19 million. Because of this, the average annual investment in telecommuni-
cations, as a percentage of GDP, was only 0.22 percent compared to 0.5 percent
proposed by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP) as
a minimum for developing countries.
Sector Objectives
24.      The telephone service in Thailand is presently largely concentrated
in urban areas, has an inadequate physical base and is constrained by limited
resources. In view of this situation and of the increasing demand for satis-
factory telephone service, particularly in rural areas, the near term ob-
jectives in the sector are (a) to improve the present quality of service
through relief of bottlenecks and phased replacement of old and worn-out
equipment and cables; (b) to serve a large segment of the population in rural
areas through extension of facilities to areas now without telephone service;
(c) to satisfy a larger proportion of demand both in rural areas and in
Bangkok through expansion of existing facilities; and (d) to provide a speedy
and efficient long-distance service through better utilization of installed
capacity in the long-distance network, accompanied by an expansion of the
network and by the introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD). The
works under the TOT's development program and the study of the economics of
telecommunications in Thailand (para 25) are designed to create a satisfac-
tory base for a balanced, sustained and more rapid development of telephone
service in the 1980s.
Study on Economics of Telecommunications
25.      TOT, in collaboration with the National Economic and Social Deve-
lopment Board of Thailand (NESDB) and with the Bank's guidance, is under-
taking an economic study to estimate the incremental costs of different types
of telecommunications usage and the incidence of its benefits; and to examine
the possibilities for cross-subsidization among user categories with particu-
lar attention to providing access to new consumers. The study will contribute
to a better definition of sector objectives and investment decisions towards
telecommunications development in the 1980s.
Previous Lending to Sector
26.       In 1972, TOT prepared a country-wide Development Program to expand
and improve domestic telephone services during the period 1972-1976. The
total cost of the Program was estimated at $188.2 million with a foreign
exchange component of $81.4 million and was to be carried out in two phases.
Financing for the foreign exchange costs of Phase I was provided by the Bank



- 9 -
Loan 864TH ($37 million) and Japanese bilateral credits ($50.4 million).
Works are progressing satisfactorily though initially execution was held up by
about a year because of general political conditions in Thailand, delays in
finalizing the Japanese bilateral credits, domestic inflation leading to
significant cost increases for all civil works and the need to negotiate civil
works contracts.
27.       In 1974, TOT reviewed and revised its Development Program after
taking stock of progress made and reassessing the sector objective outlined
in para. 24 above and Thailand's telecommunications needs. Accordingly,
TOT drew up a revised Development Program covering the needs of the sector
up to 1979. The revised Program (1972-1979) is well balanced and is based
on correct priorities and would improve the ratio of telephones available
to telephone demand by some 52 percent in rural areas and by 25 percent in
Bangkok.  The project now proposed for Bank financing is Phase II of TOT's
Development Program (1972-1979).
PART IV - THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
History of the Project
28.       The Second telecommunications Project was prepared by TOT as part
of it's ongoing Development Program (1972-1979) to be carried out in the
period 1976-1979. It was formulated during the Third Five Year National
Economic and Social Development Plan (1972-1976). The project was appraised
by a Bank Mission in April-May 1975; additional updating information was
obtained in February, 1976. The proposed loan was negotiated in Washington
from March 16, 1976 to March 19, 1976. The Thai delegation was led by H.E.
Dr. Upadit Pachariyangkun, Thai Ambassador in Washington. A report entitled
"Appraisal of the Second Telecommunications Project, Thailand" (No. 917-TH
dated April 9, 1976) is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. A loan and project summary is provided in Annex III.
TOT's Development Program 1972-1979
29.       The Program comprises a) Ongoing Works begun prior to 1972, b)
Phase I works begun in 1972-1975, c) Phase II works to be carried out during
1976-1979 and d) Future works to be completed after 1979. The total cost of
the Program is estimated at $381.8 million with a foreign exchange cost of
$159.7 million or 41.9 percent. The cost includes expenditures during the
period 1972-1975, $76.1 million, and the balance of the costs $318.6 million,
including a working capital increase of $12.9 million and contingencies of
$28.3 million, to complete the Program during 1976-1979.
Program and Project Costs
30.       During the four years that the project would be carried out,
the total costs of the different components of TOT's Development Program
FY72-79, the expenditure already incurred during FY72-75 and the balance
of the costs for FY76-79 are as follows:

TOT plans to meet the 1976-79 financing requirements of $318.6 million from
its net internal cash generation ($72.7 million), subscriber deposit ($22.9
million) and a Government equity investment ($13.7 million), totaling $109.3
million. The balance will be provided from the undisbursed balances of Loan
864-TH ($25.0 million) and Japanese bilateral credits ($65.6 million), which
are at low interest and largely untied; the proposed Bank Loan ($26.0 million)
and TOT bond sales and/or loans from Government ($56.1 million). Financing
for future works undertaken during 1976-79 ($36.6 million) would be provided
through additional borrowing when and if required.
The Project
31.       The project which is part of the investments in new facilities to
be undertaken by TOT during the period 1976-1979 will improve the present
quality of service, satisfy a wider proportion of demand through expansion
of facilities and serve a larger segment of the population in rural areas.
It comprises the following main components: a) Installation of 46,400 new
lines of local exchange equipment with associated cables and subscriber
facilities in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area to provide about 41,000 new
connections; b) Installation of about 9,500 lines of local exchange equipment
with associated subscriber facilities in the rural areas to provide about
9,000 new connections; c) Replacement of about 2,600 lines of manual exchange
and mobile exchange equipment by automatic equipment in rural areas and about
28,000 pair kilometers of telephone cables and wires and 17,000 telephone
sets; d) Installation of 53 new long distance transmission systems in the
rural areas and provision of about 6,500 channel ends for long distance
circuits on the existing and new systems; e) Installation of about 10,800
lines of trunk exchange equipment to provide nationwide STD service; f)
Installation of automatic message accounting equipment and automatic number
identification equipment for approximately 440,000 lines.

32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $94.1 million with
a foreign exchange cost of $47.8 million or 54 percent. Project costs
are summarized below.

Total Costs                         46.37          47.76      94.13
The local costs of land, buildings, and installations are based on TOT's
recent experience. The foreign costs of equipment and cables are based on
prices encountered in recent international tenders for similar items. As the
risk of cost increases due to physical overrun is small, a physical contingency
provision of about 2 percent ($1.5 million) of the local and foreign costs of
the new works has been included. To cover possible increases in prices up to
the date of contract for international procurement, a price contingency
equivalent to about 10 percent ($4.3 million) of the foreign costs of the
project has been included. To cover likely increases in the local costs
due to increases in wages and cost of civil works, a price contingency equiva-
lent to 21 percent ($8.3 million) of the local costs of the Project has been
included,
Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT)
33.      TOT, which would be the Borrower, is managed by a seven member board
of directors with the Under Secretary of State, Ministry of Communications,
as chairman.    The Board lays down broad policy and delegates full respon-
sibility and authority for day to day operations to the Managing Director, who
is a member of the Board. The incumbent Managing Director is competent and
heads a team of well-qualified senior staff members. TOT operates on com-
mercial lines but as a state enterprise, TOT's investment plans and annual
capital budget are subject to approval by National Economic and Social
Development Board and the Ministries of Communications and Finance.
34.      TOT employs a staff of about 8,400; this is expected to increase to
13,500 by the end of the project period. The present ratio of staff to 1,000
telephones is 28 which is lower than in most other developing counties and is
expected to improve to 24 through greater productivity and economies of scale.
TOT has a well-equipped Central Training Center which can annually train 400
personnel of different grades in all relevant disciplines, including finance
and management. In addition, each provincial headquarters town has a small
training center for operations and line staff. TOT will execute all aspects
of the project. Over the past years TOT's staff has demonstrated the capacity



- 12 -
for planning, detailed engineering and installation of all works under the
project including local and trunk exchange equipment, cables, subscriber
facilities and long distance transmission systems. Construction of telephone
exchange buildings and other civil works in the project would be undertaken
by contractors under TOT's supervision. Also, for administrative reasons,
the works for the junction cable networks and the microwave ratio systems,
financed under Japanese bilateral credits, will be carried out by the sup-
pliers.
Consultants Services
35.       To strengthen TOT's professional, technical and institutional
capacity to implement current and future development programs, the First
Telecommunications Project (Loan-864-TH) provided $1.97 million for
744 man months of Consultancy Services by 'Swedish Telecommunications
Consulting AB' (SWEDTEL). TOT had by March 1976 utilized 302 man months
of SWEDTEL's services, TOT is now reviewing its priority needs for further
assistance from SWEDTEL and is renegotiating its contract with SWEDTEL to
stay within the balance of funds available under Loan 864-TH. TOT will
submit its proposals to the Bank for review before finalizing a contract.
TOT's Finances
36.      TOT's operating results over the past five years (1971-75) have
been satisfactory. The operating ratio has varied between 67 percent and 74
percent and the rate of return ranged from 9.5 percent to 11.1 percent, after
deducting as operating expense remittances to Treasury amounting to 30 percent
of net income annually, being the equivalent of income tax paid by a private
concern. During this period the value of gross plant in service almost
doubled from $75.3 million to $147.5 million and TOT was able to finance about
65 percent of its requirements from internal sources and 35 percent from
borrowings. The debt/ equity ratio increased from 19:81 in 1972 to 27:73 in
1975.
37.       During the ensuing four-year period (1976-79) TOT's operating re-
sults and financial position are expected to remain satisfactory. The value
of gross plant in service is estimated to grow to $349.2 million, an increase
of 1.4 times. A rate of return ranging betwen 10.2 percent and 11.7 percent
would be achieved during this period. The operating ratio would also vary
between 69 and 76 percent. During this period there will be a substantial
change in TOT's pattern of financing as borrowings will account for about 66
percent of capital requirements. Nevertheless, the contribution from internal
sources is expected to be about 30 percent, which is satisfactory, given the
substantial projected increase in value of plant in service. The debt/equity
ratio will rise to 60:40 in 1978 and 1979 and improve thereafter. TOT has
agreed to continue to maintain a debt service coverage of 1.5 times and to ac-
hieve an annual rate of return of not less than 10 percent (see Sections 5.04
and 5.05 of the draft loan agreement).

Tariffs
38.       New tariffs for domestic telephone services, introduced from
September 1, 1975 would rectify certain weaknesses in the earlier tariff
structure, by (i) bringing government tariffs in line with those applicable to
the public; (ii) removing the free call allowance, reducing the monthly charge
and levying a charge for each call, thereby more equitably relating the charge
to telephone usage; and (iii) establishing a common telephone rental for
all services, whether provided in residences or in business premises. The
new tariffs and their structure are satisfactory and are estimated to generate
about 20 percent more revenue annually. It has been agreed that the Bank will
have an opportunity to comment on any proposed changes to TOT's existing
tariffs (see Section 4.05 of draft loan agreement) and that before introducing
its STD services, presently planned for 1978, TOT will submit its proposed
tariffs for this service to the Bank for review (see Section 3.05 (a) of the
draft loan agreement).
Billing and Collection
39.       Billing of and collections from private subscribers for both local
and long distance services are satisfactory. In respect of its departments
and agencies, the government has been earmarking funds in its budget for
rental and local call charges and has been paying these charges on a cur-
rent basis. However, in respect of long distance service and leased circuits
budget provisions are not being made and payment by Government for these
services is in arrears because of delays in verification of authorized usage
of long distance service. After reviewing the matter with TOT, the Government
is taking measures to settle all TOT's bills for telephone services on a
current basis. (See Section 3.05 (b) of the draft loan agreement and Section
3.02 (b) of the draft guarantee agreement.)
Accounts and Audit
40.       TOT's consultants, SWEDTEL, have reviewed the accounting system and
have made sound recommendations for correcting certain weaknesses in the
system. TOT, with the assistance of SWEDTEL, is implementing the recommend-
ations on which progress will be reported by TOT to the Bank as part of the
reporting requirements of the project. The annual audit of TOT is performed
by the National Audit Council (NAC). After consultation with the Bank on the
required type and scope of audit, NAC's audit has shown substantial improvement
and now meets the Bank's requirements.
Procurement
41.       Except for the trunk exchange equipment all procurement under the
proposed loan would be subject to international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement." A 15% preference margin,
or the prevailing customs duty, if lower would be extended to local manufac-
turers in the evaluation of bids. Off-the-shelf items to meet urgent require-
ments, costing less than $5,000 each and up to an aggregate amount of $100,000,



- 14 -
would be purchased through normal government procurement procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank. Trunk switching equipment will be added to small
local exchanges in rural areas originally supplied by either Bell Telephone
Manufacturing Co.(BTM) of Belgium or L.M. Ericsson (LME) of Sweden. In the
interest of standardization, maintenance and spare parts, and training and
deployment of personnel, this equipment, with a foreign exchange cost of about
$9 million, would be procured from the original suppliers provided the prices
are reasonable and satisfactory to TOT and the Bank. The total amount of such
procurement under Loan 864-TH together with the proposed loan would amount to
$12.5 million or 20 percent of the total of the two loans.
Disbursements
42.       The proposed Bank loan would finance telephone cables ($6.2 million),
subscriber facilities ($1.5 million), trunk exchange equipment ($9.0 million),
and central automatic message accounting and automatic number identification
equipment ($5.0 million). The balance amount provides for contingencies.
Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100 percent of the c.i.f. costs of
directly imported items, or the ex-factory price for items of local manufacture
procured under international competitive bidding; and at the rate of 65
percent of total expenditure for imported items procured locally. It is
expected that disbursements would be completed by October, 1979. As the
Project is part of a continuing program for development of telephone services,
any unused balance in the proposed loan would be applied, after consultation
with the Bank and under the same terms and conditions, against the costs of
goods similar to those financed under the proposed loan.
Benefits and Justification
43.       The project will expand and modernize local network capacity and
provide 50,000 new connections to help meet part of the demand in Thailand and
increase by 40 percent the number of towns and villages having telephone
service. In rural areas 42 new small towns and villages will be provided
telephone service for the first time. With this modest expansion and the
replacement of old and worn-out cables, wires and telephone instruments,
the quality of service will improve significantly. The long distance items
under the project provide for better utilization of existing transmission
systems and extension of the long-distance network through 53 new systems to
new areas in the hinterland. The trunk exchange equipment will enable intro-
duction of subscriber trunk dialling service, which will extend to TOT the
benefit of low operating costs and better utilization of long distance facili-
ties and to subscribers the benefit of an immediate and efficient long distance
service. The installation of Message Accounting equipment would minimize
present delays in verification and settling of telephone bills. The project
will substantially improve the flow of essential agricultural, business and
administrative information between industrial, commercial and agricultural
centers. The internal financial rate of return on the project investment
is 19.0 percent derived by equating the present worth of the project's con-
struction costs (excluding customs duties and taxes and price contin-
gencies) and operating cost (excluding depreciation) to the present worth



- 15 -
of attributable revenues and subscriber deposits. Even under an unfavor-
able combination of the main parameters, the rate of return is not likely
to be less than 15.0 percent. The economic rate of return would be higher
as full benefits to users would far exceed prices charged. These benefits
however, cannot be quantified.
PART V - THE LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Telephone
Organization of Thailand, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom
of Thailand and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(III) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The special features in the Loan and
Guarantee agreements are described in paragraphs 17, 37, 38 and 39 of this
Report.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 702-TH    Third Bangkok Port Project; $12.5 Million Loan of August 6,
1970; Effective Date: Novemb-er 6, 1970; Closing Date:
original, July 31, 1974; current, July 31, 1976
Construction, presently about 90% completed, is expected to
be finished by May 1976. Construction work on the project which consists
of four deep-water and two lighterage berths, together with transit sheds
and ancillary facilities is proceeding satisfactorily, but somewhat behind
the original schedule. Two berths were commissioned in November 1975, and
two more are expected to be commissioned in May 1976. The civil engineer-
ing work was placed on a fixed-price contract and the only significant cost
overruns will be those caused by changes in foreign exchange rates and the
Government's decision to compensate contractors on fixed-price contracts
for overall increases of construction costs after June 1974. The Closing
Date has been extended from July 31,' 1974 to July 31, 1976. The financial
situation of the Port Authority is very sound.
Loan 790-TH     South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project; $27 Million Loan
of November 11, 1971; Effective Date: January 27, 1972;
Closing Date: November 30, 1976
Project execution is on schedule. Costs have increased by
about 13% due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Loan 822-TH     Second Education Project (Kasetsart University); $15.4 Million
Loan of May 24, 1972; Effective Date: August 22, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
Project implementation has been delayed by about 18 months
due to late appointment of campus master planner, late Cabinet approval
of Executive Architect's fees and, more recently, delays by the Executive
Architects in preparing adequate plans and specifications on schedule. Site
development works for the Kamphaengsaen Campus have been contracted and
construction is expected to commence in March 1976 and be completed by mid-
1978. Contracts for equipment, valued at US$1.6 million, were awarded in
August 1975. Implementation of the technical assistance program is well
underway. Project costs are expected to exceed the appraisal estimate by
about US$8 million due to cost overruns for civil works. Overruns will

be met by the Government. Disbursements, currently US$2.0 million, are
expected to reach US$2.5 million by the end of FY76 and US$7.5 million by
the end of FY77.
Loan 864-TH    Telecommunications Project; $37 Million Loan of December 5,
1972; Effective Date: March 1, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The project is one year behind schedule. The delay was caused
by general political conditions in Thailand, delay in finalizing the Japanese
bilateral credit which was to finance the local network expansion in Bangkok
and the transmission equipment in the rural areas, and domestic inflation
leading to significant increases in estimated prices especially for all civil
works, and to the consequent unwillingness of the contractors to continue work
on earlier quoted tenders which had to be renegotiated. The project is now
moving forward satisfactorily and it should be practicable for TOT to over-
come some of these delays. Procurement action is well advanced and equipment
deliveries are in progress. Increased prices have required TOT to-rephase
its project financing and to redistribute some-foreign costs between Loan
864-TH and the Japanese credit. Reallocation of Loan 864-TH has been
approved. New tariffs, which came into effect in September 1975, are
expected to generate about 20 percent more revenues annually which will
help TOT finance its program.
Loan 870-TH   Fifth Highway Project; $28.6 Million Loan of December 26,
1972; Effective Date: March 26, 1973; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
Works under the project have been divided in nine contracts
of which four have been completed and two are expected to be completed
shortly, only slightly behind schedule. The remaining three contracts have
been terminated because the rapid increase in cost led to financial problems
for the contractors since, despite the Bank's recommendation, the contracts
provided only for costs escalation on petroleum products while costs from
materials, labor and equipment, and spare parts also escalated rapidly. New
bids have been obtained, of which one contract has been awarded while the
other two are awaiting Cabinet approval. Because of higher prices in the bids
for completing unfinished work, total cost of the project is expected to be
around $75 million, or about 28% above the appraisal estimate, with Government
financing the overruns. In spite of these difficulties the project is likely
to be completed no more than one year beyond the original schedule.
Credit 369-TH Third Education Project; $19.5 Million Credit of April 11,
1973; Effective Date: August 8, 1973; Closing Datei
June 30, 1978
Project implementation remains about 12 months behind sche-
dule. Delays have been caused by inexperienced project management, inade-
quate staffing of Ministry of Education design offices, late recruitment
of technical assistance and increased construction costs for civil works,



ANNEX II
Page 5
which necessitated lengthy procedures for budget approvals. Recently, ade-
quate provisions were made to meet the expected cost overruns and noticeable
progress was achieved in.civil works, proccurement and technical assistance.
About 60% of the total civil works contracts and 20% of the total furniture
and equipment contracts have been signed. Seven technical assistance experts
are in place and 50 Thais have been sent abroad for training under the project.
Project costs are now estimated at US$54.5 million, 40% above the appraisal
estimate. Actual disbursements reflect delayed implementation; they amount to
only US$0.5 million, but are expected to reach US$4.0 million by the end of
FY76. A one-year extension of the Closing Date will probably be required.
Credit 379-TH Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project; $5.5 Million
Credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: August 23, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
By the end of the 1974/75 working season, on-farm development on
5,000 ha, or 30% of the project area, had been completed; this was ahead of
the appraisal schedule. The target for the 1975/76 season is 5,300 ha, but
only 4,000 ha are reasonably firm because of problems with cadastral surveys
and lack of design staff. Organizational problems, which in the past did
not seriously impede physical progress, now appear to be presenting difficul-
ties in project implementation.
Loan 898-TH    Fourth Railways Project; $15 Million Loan of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: September 28, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project is behind schedule by about 18 months due to slow pro-
curement. However, except for rails required for track renewals yet to be
ordered, a large part of the material and equipment has been ordered and re-
ceived. The revised estimates of the project costs show an increase of about
U$16 million equivalent, mainly in local costs. Passenger traffic continues
to grow (6% per annum) but the growth of freight traffic during 1974/75 has
been marginal (2.5%) and lower than anticipated. Substantial increases
in tariffs for freight and passenger traffic were introduced in October/
November 1975 which will lead to significant improvements in the financial
situation. Even so, with increasing cost of wages, fuel and material the
SRT is not likely to reach the prescribed rate of return of 2%.
Credit 461-TH Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project; $7 Million Credit
of February 19, 1974; Effective Date: October 7, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Project implementation began about six months later than
scheduled because of delays in final approval of the consultant's contract.
There have been further delays in equipment procurements due to establish-
ment of new legal procedures for government approval of contract documents.



ANNEX II

Despite these delays, good progress was made in the 1975/76 working season
on rehabilitation and improvement of the main canal systems, and in the
setting up of agricultural extension services.
Loan 977-TH    Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric Projects; $75 Million Loan of
April 15, 1974; Effective Date: June 14, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980
Construction of the project is slightly ahead of schedule. Based
on the recent sector review, it appears that the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand's (EGAT) financial position may become difficult,
unless tariffs are raised. This and other sector issues are being reviewed
in a sector report, which will be discussed with the Government in June,
1976.
Loan 992-TH     Second Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT)
Project; $12.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1974; Effective
Date: September 4, 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The full amount of the $12 million loan has been committed.
The commitment was more rapid than originally estimated. Disbursements have
also been very satisfactory; as of February 29, 1976 total disbursements
amounted to $8.5 million. Since June 1974 when the loan was made, IFCT's
operations and financial condition has continued to be satisfactory.
Loan 1021-TH    Bangkok Water Supply Project; $55 Million Loan of June 28,
1974; Effective Date: December 2, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Construction work on the project has not commenced. Most of the
contracts have been tendered but bid evaluation and contract award, which
have yet to be finalized in several cases, have generally taken up to six
months longer than scheduled. The project is presently estimated to be
about 12 months behind schedule and to cost about 10% more than the April
1974 forecasts.
Loan 1149-TH    Phitsanulok Irrigation Project; $95 Million Loan of
July 25, 1975; Effective Date: October 31, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The loan became effective on October 31, 1975. After a delay
of several months, key project staff have been appointed and consultants
have been selected.

Procurement:        Except for trunk exchange equipment, procurement
of all items of equipment, and cables financed through
the proposed Bank loan would be subject to interna-
tional competitive bidding pursuant to Bank guidelines.
In the case of international bidding a 15 percent
preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty, if
lower, would be     extended to local manufacturers in
the evaluation of bids. Procurement of off-the-shelf
items for immediate requirements costing less than
$5,000 each, and up to an aggregate amount of $100,000
would be purchased through normal government procurement
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. About 10,800 lines
of trunk exchange equipment costing about $9 million in
foreign exchange, to be added small local exchanges in
rural areas, will be procured from the original suppliers
of local exchange equipment in these exchanges, the Bell
Telephone Manufacturing Co. of Belgium and L.M. Ericsson
of Sweden provided reasonable terms, satisfactory to TOT
and the Bank, are offered. This is necessary in terms of
standardization of equipment, organization of mainte-
nance and spare parts, and deployment and training of
personnel. For similar reasons, the local exchange
equipment for the Bangkok Metropolitan area will be
procured under the Japanese bilateral credits from the
original suppliers, the Nippon Electric Co. of Japan
(NEC).
