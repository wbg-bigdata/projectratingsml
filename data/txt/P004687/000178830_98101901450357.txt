APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
THAILAND
SU1MUFY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Second Teleconmuuni-
cations Project in Thailand for which a Bank loan of US$26 million is
proposed.  The Borrower and the Beneficiary would be the Telephone
Organization of Thailand (TOT), a state enterprise responsible for
domestic telephone services.
ii.       Telephone services in Thailand are at present deficient both
in quality and in ability to meet the demand for service. The telephone
density at end of 1975 was only 0.76 telephones per 100 population, with
service largsly concentrated in urban areas. The unsatisfied demand in
the country for new telephone lines exceeded the working lines by 19%.
Due to overloading of the available facilitieF in the local network and
the need to rehabilitate the old plant, over 53% of local call attempts
by subscribers are unsuccessful.  On long-distance calls, facilities are
mainly available at the main centers and even where service is available
there are delays due to shortage of circuits and manual boards.
iii.      To overcome the deficiencies in the telephone services and to
meet thm demand in part, TOT has drawn up an d-year (FY72-79) develop-
ment Progran with the following near-term. sector objectives: (a) to reha-
bilitate the network and relieve traffic bottlenecks; (b) to expand the
local network in both urban and rural areaF; and (c) to imprc2ve the existing
long-distance service, introduce subscriber trunk dialling (STD) and
extend service to many new areas.
iv.       The Program incorporates the following:  (a) a carry-forward
of works initiated prior to FY72; (b) the first Bank-financed Telecoruruni-
cations Project (FY72-76) under Loan 864-TH (US$37 million) now under
execution; (c) thie proposed Telecommunications Project (FY76-79) identified
for a second Bank Loan to TOT; and (d) future works. Thp total investment
under the Program is estim.ated at B 7,826.60 million (US$381.79 million)
with a foreign exchange content of B 3,272.75 million (US$1f9.64 million).
The average annual capital expenditure which wa- only US$17 million prior
tc the Program and US$19 million in FY72-75 will rise to US$76 million in
FY76-79. Even then, the average annual investment in telecommunications
in FY76-79 will cnly be 0.22% of GDP, which is low compared to the O.5%
proposed by ESCAP a.- a rainimaum for developing countries in Asia.
v.        The Project will increase local systen capacity by 15% and allow
50,0O0 new subscribers to be connected. In rural areas, 42 small towns
and villages will be connected to the telephone services for the first time.
The number of telephones per 100 population will increase by 7h% to 1.3&
by end of FY79; even so the unsatisfied demand in the country at end of



- ii -
FY79 will be 5% higher than at end of FY75.  The long-distance facilities
will be expanded by 53 new systems; addition of 6,500 channel ends fcr long-
distance circuits on existing and new sys tems and the introducticr of STD
will improve the speed and quality of long-distance corr.unicetion.
vi.        The estimated cost of the Project is B 1,929.67 million (US$94.13
million) with a foreign exchange content of B 979.00 mrillion (UkLY4.76
million).  The proposed Bank loan of US$26$ million will meet 54% of the
foreign costs, the balance of the foreign costs Is to be coveredl by the
Jananese bilateral credits.  The Project would be executed by the TOT
and Is technically and financially sound.  The works under this Project
combined with those of the First Telecommunications Project form a viable
and balanced package; they will also crealte a satisfactory physical,
financial and managerial base for more adequate and sustained delvelopment
of telephone services in the 1980's, including deeper penetration of tele-
communication in all areas of the country. In order to facilitate this,
the Bank is participating in an economic study to assess the development
aFpect of telecommunications in Thailand.
vii.      All procurement under the proposed loan would be subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Grcup's
"Guidelines for Procurement," except for the procurement of trunk auto-
matic exchange equipment costing about US$9 million which is to be added
to small local exchanges in rural areas. The trunk equipment in each
station should, it is proposed, be procured from the supplier of the
local exchange equipmert previously selected through international bidding.
This is prudent in terTns of standardization of equipment, organization of
maintenance and spare parts, and training and deployment of personnel, and
is the least-cost solution.
viii.      TOT'r management and organization are generally satisfactory.  TOT
is takir.g steps to moderni2e and improve its accounting system to provide
better ranagement information.
ix.        TOT'F past operating results have been satisfactcry and its present
financial position is sound. However, in order to meet local currency fund
requirements during FY76-79 TOT intends to raise B 1,150 million in respect
of Phases I and II of the Program and B 300 million in respect of future
works. TheFe funds would be raised through borrowings consisting of bonds
to be purchased by future subscribers as a condition of obtaining service,
from bonds sold to the public and/or loans arranged through goverrnment.
There is also a provision for a Government equity investment of B 300 mil-
lion as set out in Loan Agreement 864-TH. On this basis, forecasts show
that TOT's financing plan is viable, that TOT would be financing a reasonable
porticn (3%2 ) of capital expansion from internal sources and wou'll
maintain a satisfactory financial position while carrying out the expansion
program. The i nternal financial rate of return is estimated at 19%.
x.         -ilith thi  afreeerrents infiieated in Chapter VII, the Pro-ject
forms a ouitable basis for a Bank loan of US$26 million equivalent to the
TOT for a term of 20 years including a four-year grace period.



APPRAISAL OF
THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
THAILAND
I: Introduction
1.01      On behalf of the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT),
the Government of Thailand has requested the Bank for assistance in
financing the foreign exchange costs of the second phase of TOT's
plans for development of domestic telephone services in Thailand.
1.02      TOT is executing an 8-year (FY72-79) Program which comprises:
(a) the ongoing works spilling over into this period; (b) a development
plan for FY72-79 for rehabilitation and expansion of domestic telephone
services with particular emphasis on development in rural areas; and
(c) future works.  The development plan is divided into two overlapping
phases. Phase I (FY72-76) constituted the First Telecommunications
Project financed by the Bank through Loan 864-TH for US$37 million and
is now under execution. A major part of this phase will however be
carried out in the FY76-79 period due to past slippages.  Phase II
(FY76-79) constitutes the Second Telecommunications Project identified
for the proposed second Bank lending operation in the telecommunications
sector. The estimated cost of the Program is B 7,826.60 million (US$381.79
laillion) with a foreign exchange content of B 3,272.75 million (US$l59.64
million).
1.03      The Project now proposed for Bank financing complements the
First Project for development of telephone services and will particularly
improve telephone communications in rural areas. The proposed Project
provides for:  (a) replacement of the old worn-out equipment and cables
which will reduce faults; (b) expansion cf the local networks to provide
about 50,00 new connections to meet partially the telephone demand and
extend service to new areas in the hinterland; and (c) expansion of the
long-distance facilities and introduction of nationwide subscriber trunk
dialling which will greatly improve the quality and speed of long-distance
service and particularly ben-fit the rural areaF. The estimated cost
of the Project is B 1,929.67 million (US$94.13 million) with a foreign
exchange content of B 979.00 million (US$47.76 million).
1.04      A Bank loan of US$26 million is propcsed which would meet 54%
of the foreign costs of the Project. The Borrower and the Beneficiary
would be the TOT.
1.05      This report was prepared by Meesrs. D.F.D. Joshi and J.M. Vance
based on their findings during an appraisal missicn to Thailand in April-
May 1975 and on updating information supplied by the TOT in February 1976.



II: The Sector
Background
2.01      The public telecommunications facilities in Thailand are
state-owned. The Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), a state
enterprise under the Ministry of Communications, is responsible for
management, operation and development of domnestic local and long-
distance telephone services (paras. 5.02 to 5.04). The Post and
Telegraph Department (PTD), a government department under the same
Ministry, is responsible for telegraph, telesx and all international
telecommunications services.
2.02      In Thailand, three-fourths of the population of 4O million
depend on agriculture for a living, and agriculture makes the largest
contributicn (30%) to GDP. Rice, the staple food of the people, is
produced throughout the country and is the rnain export. Production
of other major export items such as sugar, cassava, rubber, maize and
tin is widely dispersed over 514,000 sq. Ions. of the country's area.
This geographic spread of export items, the development of industry in
different regions, the efforts being made to achieve greater equality
between urban and rural areas through increased allocation of resources
to rural areas, the 'tambon' program involving decentralization of
decision making to village levels, the development of tourism (fourth
largest foreign exchange earner in Thailand) and effective use of
transport facilities, all place special demELnds on telecommunications
for the quick flow of essential agricultural, business and adninistra-
tive information between industrial, commercial and agricultural centers.
Access to Service
2.03      Conpared with some other countries at similar stages of develop-
ment, the quality and the quantity of telephone services are poor.  Annex 1
gives relative figures for telephones in service in some countries in
January 1975.  Telephone facilities existing in Thailand at the end of FI75
are given in Annex 2.
2.04      The availability of telephones, th.at is, the ratio of working
telephones to total telephone demand (defined as the sum of working lines
and unsatisfied demand) is very low, particularly in areas cther than
Bangkok, as shown below for the end of FY75:
Working      Unsatisfied       Telephone
Lines         Demand        Availability
Bangkok Metropolitan       170,300        139,400             O.55
Area
ReFt of Thailand            48 60C        120,800             0.29
Total                 261,900                           0746
The telephone density in Thailand of only o.76 telephones installed per
100 population is low compared to 2.21 in NaLaysia, 1.3C in Papua New Guinea
and 1.09 in the Philippines. The proportion of urban telephones in the
nearby Asian region has been given by ESCAP as 63%. Against this, 80%



- 3 -
of the telephones in Thailand are installed in Bangkok (which has only
11% of the country's population). Even then, Bangkok's telephone density
of 5.5 per 100 population is much lower than for other comparable cities
in the same region of the world (Hong Kong: 22.8, Manila: 21.7, Singapore:
12.5). The telephone density in rural areas is only 0.2 and is also lower
than in rural areas of many comparable countries in Asia and Africa (Syria:
0.5, Egypt: 0.6, Zambia: 0.6). In fact, many areas in the hinterland of
Thailand are without any access to telephone service.
2.05      The proportion of telephone lines installed in business premises
in Bangkok is about 48% of the total whereas in rural areas it is about
82%.  Though the remaining telephone lines are installed in residential
premises, these are primarily used for business or commercial calls. Rec-
ognizing this fact, the TOT has abolished the distinction in tariffs ap-
plicable to the business and residential categories from September 1975.
2.o6      In local networks, 53% of the call attempts by subscribers are
unsuccessful (Annex 3). Approximately 68% of the call failures are due
to called numbers being busy, a situation caused by inadequate exchange
capacity and consequent shortage of working lines to meet the demandl.
0f the remaining call failures, the major part is due to old cables and
wires interrupted by too many joints, and a large number of old and de-
fective telephone instruments.
2.07      All major centers of the country are provided with back-bone
trunk routes through high-capacity microwave, UHF and VHF radio systems.
However, the number of active circuits in these systems is only a fraction
of the available capacity. The shortage of trunk circuits vis-a-vis even
the present traffic demand is further compounded by shortage of manual
boards to operate the available circuits, resulting in delayF of several
hours on long-distance calls in peak traffic periods. About 15% of the
calls booked are subsequently cancelled by callers because of unacceptable
delays. The shortage of circuits, poor quality of service, and lack of
spur trunk routes feeding deeper into the countryside, result in poor
exploitation of the traffic and revenue potential of the available long-
distance facilities.
Sector Objectives
2.08      A country-wide development plan for local and long-distance
services was evolved in 1972 covering the 5-year period FY72-76. Starting
from a low physical base, and with the resources available, this plan was
of necessity of an interim nature. Sub3equently, in 1974, the plan was
enlarged to incorporate nationwide subscriber trunk dialling (STD); the
plan period was also extended by three yearF to FY79. The near-term
objectives in the sector are: (a) to rehabilitate the network and provide
relief to traffic bottlenecks; (b) to enlarge the acceFs to telephone ser-
vice in rural areas and, in the process, improve the utilization of the
available capacity in the long-distance network; (c) to expand the local
networks in both the Bangkok Mletropolitan area and the rural areas which,



- 14 -
while not fully satisfying the derland for new connections, will prevent
a further build-up of congestion; and (d) to provide a speedy and
efficient long-distance service. The works under the Program and the
studies noui being undertaken (para, 2.17) are designed to create a
satisfactory base for a balanced, rapid and sustained development of
telephone services in the 1980's.
2.09      The quality of service will be improved through rehabilitation
or replacerierlt of old and defective equipment and cables and through
relief of traffic bottlenecks by addition of equipment at critical points
of congestion. However, traffic congestion due to heavy use of individual
telephones would continue because of TOT's inability to meet tLe total
demand.
2.10      While the Program provides a 66% eNpansion of lccal system
capacity in the It-year period FY76-79, even at a conservative estimate of
9.5d, average annual growth in demarnd fcr new telephone connections, the
total unsatisfied demand in the country will be higher by 51 at end of
FY79 than at end of FY75.  In Bangkok the increase in unsatisfied demand
will be 1%; however, in rural areas it will be 1Q0 due to generation of
additional demands with increaFe in economic activity, the increased rate
of telephone development, and extension of service to 52 new areas through
new long-distance spur routes. The number of towns and villages having
telephone service will increase by about 52% during the 4-year period
FY76-79. The speed and quality of long-distance service will also be
appreciably improved through introduction of subscriber trunk dialling
(STD) service in the long-distance network which will provide subscribers
with an irirmediate and efficient long-distanze service.
2.11      Expected changes in some important p2rameters reflecting avail-
ability of telephone service between FY75 and FY79 are surmmarized below.

Investment Program
2.12      To implement the sector objectives during the 8-year (FY72-79)
development period, the Progran contemplates a total investment of US$381.79
million with a foreign exchange content of US$159.64 million. Even with
the increased investments in telecommunications during the last four years
of the Program, the average annual investment as a percentage of the GDP
is only 0.22% compared to the figure of 0.5% proposed by ESCAP as a minimum
for the developing countries in Asia. The broad distribution of investment
between the local networks in urban and rural areas and the long-distance
network which primarily benefits the rural areas, is as follows:
Total       Percentage
Cost         of Total
(US$ Miillions)

Sector Constraints
2.13      The telecormrurnications sectcr in Thailand has been developing
without Government budget support or local borrowings for capital expansion.
Consequently, expansion haF been tied to TOT's capacity to generate funds
from internal sources and to borrou externally.
2 .14     The average annual capital investrent in the past was US$17
million during the four-year period FY68-71 and US$19 million during the
next four years FY72-75.  For the period FY76-79, TOT'. annual invest-
ment will be US$76 million. This increased rate of annual investment
is made possible because of higher revenues from increased and improved
quality of service, frcm new tariffs which are estimated to increase revenues
by some 20%, and by a higher level of external borrowings. Subscriber trunk
dialling, a particularly lucrative source of revenue, will have an impact on
TOT's revenues only from FY79 onwards and will thereafter be an irmportant
factor in further increasing TOT's revenues in the 1980's. The internal
cash generation for the four-year period FY76-79 is estimated to be
three times that of the four-year period FY68-71, and will allow TOT tc self-
finance 30% of their FY76-79 investm!ent program, which is more than three
times larger than that of the previous fcur years.
2.15      External borrowings form a large portion of TOT'F investment require-
ments for the FY72-79 Program. These include the first Bank loan of US$37
million and the proposed loan of US$26 million and Japanese bilateral creditE
of US$74 million, largely untied (para. 3.19).



-6-
Future Plans
2.16      During the 1980s, afte!r the completion of the current Program,
it is expected that an even greater level of internal cash generation
will provide a solid financial base for the development of the telecommuni-
cations sector.
2.17      To improve upon the definition of sector objectives and the quality
of investment decisions, the TOT in collaboration with the National Economic
and Social Development Board (NESDB) of Thailand and the Bank is undertaking
a study of the economics of telecommunications in Thailand.  The study will
estimate the incremental costs of different types of service (urban, rural,
long-distance, international), define the nature of telecommunications usage
and the incidence of its benefits, and examine the possibilities for cross-
subsidization among user categories with particular attention to providing
access to new consumers. Through a more scientific assessment of the develop-
ment impact of telecommunications in the country, the TOT will be better able
to give a more purposeful direction to its future development activities and
investments.

III: The Program and the Project
Background
3.01      In 1972, the Government of Thailand had approved a plan
prepared by the TOT for development of domestic telephone services
in Thailand during FY72-76. The total investment for the plan was
then estimated at US$168 million with a foreign exchange component
of US$87 million. Phase I of the plan constituted the First Telecom-
munications Project in Thailand under Bank Loan 864-TH (US$37 million).
The works under this Project are indicated in Annex )4 (Col. 3).
3.02      At a very early stage, TOT's development plan was overtaken
by the world price increases in 1973-74 (particularly of copper) and
increases in the local costs due to inflation. Political conditions
and changes in the government also caused delays in the early stages.
In 1974, TOT reassessed and revised its plans to fit in with the new
situation. The revised plan incorporated all the essentials of the
earlier plan. In addition, it provided for introduction of nationwide
STD service. Because of initial delays and introduction of a major
new element in the plan, the plan period was extended by three years
to FY79. The plan was divided into two phases, Phase I for the period
FY72-76 and Phase II for the period FY76-79.
The Program
3.03      TOT's FY72-79 Program comprises the following:
(a)  Ongoing works, that is,works under execution in FY71
spilling over into FY?2-79 (para. 3.06);
(b) Phase I (FY72-76) works constituting the First Tele-
communications Project (paras. 3.07 and 3.08);
(c) Phase II (FY76-79) works constituting the proposed
Second Telecommunications Project (para. 3.09);
(d) Future (Phase III) Works (para. 3.06).
3.Ol      The telecommunication facilities to be added under the Prograi
are detailed in Annex L4. The sizes of expansion of local telephone net-
workE in the Bangkok Metropolitan area and in the Provinces have been
unchanged from those proposed in the earlier plan (para. 3.01).  The size
of expansion of the lonp-distance network has been increased t  mEe^-t the
requirements of a nationwide STD service.  The target dates fcr all these
works have been extended to FY79.
3.05      The total estiuiated cost of the Program is B 7,326.50 million
(US.381.,9 million) with a foreign exchange content of B 3,272.75 million
(US$159.64 million). A sunmary of the local and foreign costs of the
different components of the Program (para. 3.03) and the loanF and credits



available or required for financing the foreign costs are indicated in
Annex 5. The annual investment program for different items is at
Annex 6. The sources of financing of the! foreign costs of different
items of equipment and services in the Program are indicated in Annex 7.
Ongoing Works and Future Works
3.06      The ongoing works are works undLer execution in FY71 spilling
over into the Program period. These primarily provide for expansion of
local telephone networks in Thailand and are expected to be completed
by end of FY75. The estimated cost of the ongoing works is B 455.81
million (US$22.24 million) with a foreign exchange content of B 53.24
million (U1S$2.60 million). The future works are works to be undertaken
during the Program period as part of the next phase (Phase III) of TOT's
development plans.  The estimated cost of the future  works is B 1,205.00
million (US$58.78 million) with a foreign exchange content of B b.50.00
million (US$21.94 million).
First Telecommunications Project
3.07      Phase I (FY72-76) of the Program constituted the First Tele-
communications ProJect now under executicn though ovter one year behind
schedule.  The delay was caused by general political conditions in
Thailand, delay in finalizing the Japanese bilateral credit which was
to finance the local network expansion in. Bangkok and the transmission
equipment in the rural areas, and domestic inflation leading to signifi-
cant increaseF in estimated prices especially for all civil works, and
to the ccnsequent unwillingness of the contractors to continue work on
earlier cuoted tenders which had to be renegotiated.
3.08      Thr estimated revised cost of the First Telecommunications
Project is B 3,857.08 million 'US$188.15 million) with a foreign exchange
content of B 1,790.51 million 'tUS$87.34 million). The revised costs are
being met by rephasing of investments under the TOT's Pro-ram4 a chanoe
in allccation of the Bank loan due to financing of the transmission equip-
ment from the Japanese credit instead of the Bank loan, and a redistribu-
tion of costs because cf drop -.n copper prices since 1'97a. The realloca-
tion of the proceeds of the loan to the different categories as proposed
by the TCT has since been approved by the Ban1 (Annex 8).  The realloca-
tion took into account the higller costs encountered on items already
procured under the Bank loan and possible price increa.ses on the Bank-
financed items still to be procured.
Second Telecommunications Pro_ ect
3.09      The Second T-lecommunications Project (FY76-79) identified for
the proposed seccnd Bank loan to TOT comprises the following works:
a) Installation of )46,416 lines cf additional capacity in
local exchanges and associated cables and subscriber
facilities in the Bangkok Metropolitan area for giving
about 41,OC00 new connections.



- 9 -
b)  Installation of 9,518 lines of additional capacity in local
exchanges and associated cables and subscriber facilibies ir
the Provinces for giving about 9,000 new connections.
c) Replacement of (i) 2,090 lines in manual exchanges and
576 lines in mobile exchange7 by automatic exchanges,
(ii) 28,100 pair kilometers of telephone cables and
wires, and (iii) 17,000 telephone sets.
d1)  Installation of 53 new long-distance transmission systems
ai.d provision of 6,500 channel-ends for long-distanef
circl1its on the existing and new systeme.
e)  Installation of 10,8CO lines of trunk exchange equipment
to provide nationwide STD service.
Project Costs
3.10      The estimated cost of the Project is 1 1,929.67 million (UJS$94.13
million) with a foreign exchange content of B 979.00 million (US$47.76
million).  The schedule below sets olit the costs of different items of the

3.11      The local costs of land, buildings and installation are based
on TOT's recent experience. The foreign costs of equipment and cables
are based on prices encountered in recent international tenders for
similar items. A Bank loan of US$26 millicn to the TOT is proposed to
finance 54% of the foreign costs of the Project. The balance of the foreign
costs are covered by Japanese bilateral credits.
Contingencies
3.12      Telecommunication development is a continuous process that
occurs through new installations or plant expansion at hundreds of
locations in any year. Because of this, additional requirements of
equipment and cables at some points are generally compensated by
reductions at others; hence, the risk of cost increases due to physical
overrun is small.  A physical contingency provision of about 2% of the
local and foreign costs of the new works has been included, amounting to
B 31.81 million (US$I.55 million) with a foreign exchange component of
B 16.61 million (US$0.81 million).
3.13      In teleconmmunication equipment contracts, it is usual to have
firm prices through the period of delivery.  To cover possible increases
in price up to the date of contract for international procurement, a
price contingency provision of B 88.4L7 million (US$4.32 million) equiva-
lent to about 10% of the foreign costs of the Project hap been included.
To cover likely increases in the local costs due to increase in wages
and costs of civil works, a price contingency of B 167.13 million (US$8.15
million) equivalent to 21% of the local costs of the Project has been in-
cluded. Details of the contingency provisions are shown at Annex 9.
Items for Bank Financing

Procurement
3.15      Except for the trunk switching equipment, all items to be
financed through the proposed Bank loan will be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guide-
lines applicable to such procurement. A 15% preference or the prevailing
customs duty whichever is lower will be allowed to local manufacturers.
TOT would also be allowed to procure locally off-the-shelf items for
immediate requirements. The cost of each such item will be limited to
US$5,000 and the total such purchases under the Bank loan limited to
US$100,000.,
3.16      TOT proposeE to procure through negotiations from suppliei-s
of existing equipment about 10,800 lines of trunlc switching equipment
at a cost of US$9.00 million subject to prices being satisfactory to
the TOT and the Bank. These 10,800 lines of trunk switching equipment
are to be installed in 132 provincial towns throughout Thailand. The
average size of trunk installation per location will be only 80 lines.
These towns are now equipped with local telephone exchanges varying
from 40C to 2,000 lines. The equipment for each of these local ex-
changes was originally supplied by either Bell Telephone Manufacturing
Co. (BTM) o. Belgium or L.M. Ericsson (LME) of Sweden after inter-
national competitive bidding.  Thp trunk switching equipment to be
installed at each station will be only about 10% of the total (local
plus trunk) switching equipment in each station. The correct solution
in terms of least cost, standardization, training and deployment of
personnel, and organization of maintenance and. spare parts iF for the
small quantity of the trunk switching equipment to be added at each
station to be of the same make and procured from the same supplier as
the local exchange equipment now existing in that station.
3.17      The foreign costs of trunk switching equipment to be procured
from the two suppliers of the local exchange equipment is estimated at
US$9.00 million or 34.6% of the proposed loan amount.  Wlhile this is
higher than in other telecommunications projects, it is due to the way
in which procurement outside international competitive bidding has been
apportioned between the Bank-financed items in Phase I and Phase II.
Under the first loan, procurement outside international competitive
bidding was agreed to for an amount up to US$3.50 million (or 9.5% of the
loan amount). The total procurement outside international competitive
bidding under that loan and the proposed Bank loan taken together would
be US$12,.50 million or 20% of the total of the two loans. IBRD/IDA have
agreed in the past to procurement outside international competitive bidding
up to this Jevel in other telecommunications projects.
Project 'rxec.tion
3.18      TOT staff has the canability of planning, detailed engineering
and installation of all works under the Project including local and trunk
exchange equipment, cables, subscribers facilities and the long-distance
transmission systems. However, for administrative reasons, TOT proposes



- 12 -
to have the microwave radio equipment in rural areas and junction cable
network in Bangkok (both financed by the Japanese credits) installed by
the equipment and cable suppliers. The annual local and long-distance
telephone d1evelopment targets are at Annex 10.
Disbursements
3.19      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed at the rate of (a) 100%
against the CTn  costs of the directly imported items, (b) l0C% against the
ex-factory costs, net of local taxes, for locally manufactured items, and
(c) 65% of total expenditures for imported items procured locally.  The
schedule of quarterly disbursements is at Annex 11.  As the proposed Pro-
ject is part of a continuing development program for the telecommunications
sector, it is proposed that any unused balances sholuld be applied, after
consultation with the Bank and under the sane terms and conditions, against
the costs of goods sirilar to those financed under the Bank loan.

IV:  Project Justification
General
.0l1      TOT's FY72-79 Program is designed to provide satisfactory domes-
tic telephone services in Thailand to support the national development
objectiver in the fields of commerce, industry, agriculture and govern-
ment administration, with particular emphasis on rural areas. The Program
is modest in scope in relation to the demand because of financial con-
straints, but lays stress on improvement in the long-distance service
(which is of central importance to rural areas) and on the provision of
service to areas now without telephones.
4.02      The Program comprises priority works designed to (a) improve
considerably the present quality of service through relief of traffic
bottlenecks and phased replacement of the old worn-out equipment and
cables, (b) satisfy a larger proportion of demand through expansion of
facilities, and (c) serve a larger segment of the population in rural
areas through extension of facilities to areas now without telephone ser-
vice.
Local Telephone Service
4.03      The historical and forecast growth of the total demand and the
working lines are indicated in the table and diagram at Annexes 12 and 13.
TOT does not maintain any waiting lists of potential subscribers desiring
telephone connections. Instead, it assesses the demand by block-by-block
field survey of each area to determine the telephone potential of each
existing and projected building. TOT has assessed the total demand (work-
ing lines plus unsatisfied demand) to increase from about 479,100 at the
beginning of the Project to about 687,000 on its completion. The fore-
cast growth in the total demand over the Project period thus averages only
9.5% per annum; this is conservative and less than 10-1% obtaining in
most developing countries. The actual demand is likely to exceed the pro-
jected growth since TOT's own past experience has shown that, when new
facilities are added in any area, the number of applicants for new connec-
tions in that area has been considerably higher than forecast. Hence,
there is little danger of over-provision of facilities. Even based on
TOT's conservative forecast of growth of demand, and in spite of 66% in-
crease in the local telephone system capacity, the unsatisfied demand for
new telephone conrections in the country will rise by 5% from about 260,200,
to about 273,500 during the Project period.  The availability of telephone /
is however expected to increase from 46% to 60% during the same period.
4.04      In the rural areas, the local networks will be expanded to pro-
vide ll5% more connections during the Project period (against 80% increase
for the country as a whole). All the remaining manual exchanges will be
replaced by modern automatic exchanges in preparation for the introduction
D_ natiorLwiJe STD service.  In addition, the number of towns and villages
having telephone -ervice will be increased by )40% by providing telephone
service for the first time to 42 new areas.  The unsatisfied demand in the
rural area- will increase from about 120,800 to about 132,500 during the
Project period.
1,.o5     In the Bangkok Metropolitan area, the working lines will be in-
creased from 170,30C to 309,000 (an increase of 833) during the Project
KL/ Telephone Availability is working lines expressed as a percentage of
-   total demand (working lines plus unsatisfied demand).

period.  Thi availability of telephones will increase from. 55'% to 69X';
this will reduce the present heavy usage of existing telephones and
thereby the nunber of repeat calls clue to called telephones being bu-sy.
The unsatis.ied demand in Bangkok will increase from about 139,4C0  tD
T41,OC0 dur:Lng the Project period.
I,.o6     The considerable quantities of old telephone cables and tele-
phone instrumnents in service cause EL high number of faults.  To reduce
fault incidence and improve service, particularly in view of the STD
program, TOT has plans for phased replacement of 28,100 pair-kilometars
of old cables and wireF and 17,000 telephone instruments by FY79.
Long-Distance Telephone Service
4.0f'f7   In any country, telephone subscribers in the rural areas use
the telephone facilities largely to make calls to nearby towns and other
centerF which provide administrative, commercial and other services. The
local telephone network in the rural areas, particularly in the very small
exchanges, serves primarily as an adjunct to the long-distance telephone
network. Therefore, for proper development of the rural areas, an effi-
cient long-distance service is of prime impcrtance. The present Project
lays emphasiis on the expansion and extension of the long-distance tele-
phone netwcrk in Thailand.
4.08      Al, present, the long-distance service! is me.ager and poor, being
subject to heavy delays due largely to unbalanc:ed development and existence
of bottlenecks. While the basic long-distance network of' transmission
sqystems is f'airly wide-spread, past investments on this network are not
yielding full benefits due to insufficient utilization of available capacity
in the transmission systems and lack of terminating equipment and manual
boards for operating the circuits.  rhe Project aims at providing the balanc-
ing items like the multiplex eoquipment for better utilization of the availa-
ble transmission systems and the add:ition of 53 new transmission systems for
extending telephone service to new a:reas in the hinterland.
4.09     The rumber of channel ends for long-distance circuits will be
ir,ereased fror 15X,L40 to 11,900 under the Project. Thr ocid1itiori of 10,C.'.-
lines of trunk automatic exchange equipment will provide adequate termina-
tions for the long-distance circuits and junctions to local networks and
enable introducti.on of natiornide STI) service. This service wi1ll extend
to TOT the ben-iit of low operating costs and better utilization of long-
distance facilities and to subscribers the benefit of an immediate and
efficient long-distance service.
Least Cost Solution
4.10      TOT's Program is based on long-term fundamental plans for develop-
ment of domestic telephone services in Thailand.  These plans are based on
accepted practices in telecommunications and on sound engineering designs
appropriate to particular disciplines in telephony.
1/  TO'" has assessed the number cf lcng-di-8-:^ce e!rrn]n    and trurk aut-
matic exchange eqipment on the basis that  'n converFion of any route
from urcEent manual working to STD, the nr-'ber of long-distance calls
will imr:-Aiqtely increase by three times while sinultaneously the
average holding time per call will reducp from present average of three
minutes to one and a half minutes.



- 15 -
4 .11     The local exchange equipment and telephone cable network designs
follow accepted practices to minimize costs. Automatic operation of local
and long-distance services provides for fast and efficient servaice at least
cost through economy in operation and high usage of available facilities.
TOT's decision to provide at each station the trunk exchange equipment of
the same make as the local exchange equipment installed in that station is
also the least-cost solution on grounds of organization of maintenance and
spare parts, and training and deployment of personnel.
4.12      The dimensioning and timing of works under the Program and the
Project have been determined by (a) the requirements of improving the ser-
vice to existing subscribers, meeting new demands in existing areas and ex-
tending telephone service to new areas, and (b) the constraints of available
resources and the capacity for execution.
Return on Investment
4.13      The internal financial rate of return - defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the
project with the capital and operating costs, excluding taxes - is 19%
(Annex 14). A sensitivity analysis shows that, under an unfavorable com-
bination of the main parameters, the rate of return would be not less than
15. The rate of return suggests that on average the price that the
telephone subscribers are required to pay for telecormunications service is
considerably in excess of the long-run marginal costs.
4.14      The economic rate of return is undoubtedly higher than the fore-
going suggests since (a) the prices charged do not adequately measure the
full benefits to the suibscribers, primarily business, industry and agri-
culture, and (b)  the costs include the full costs of extending the net-
work and providing facilities in new areas even though the full benefits
will only obtain in the future when additional lines are connected.

V: The Borrower
Legal Status and Authority
5.01      The Borrower and the Beneficiary would be the TOT, a state
enterprise under the Ministry of Communications constituted through an
Act of Parliament in 195la. TOT oiperates along commercial lines with
adequate autonomy, but like all state enterprises in Thailand, TOT's
inveFtment plans and annual capital budgets have to be approved by the
Government.
Organization and Mianagement
5.02      Annex 15 shows the TOT's organizational structure and the
functional responsibilities of the various departments. TOT is managed
by a seven-member Dcard of Directors. It comprises the Chairman (who
is the Under-Secretary of the iMinistry of Communications), the Managing
Director of TOT (who is also its Chief Executive) and five other mem-
bers of whom one is the former Managing Director, and two each from the
civil service and the military.  The Board lays down broad policy for
TOT and delegates full responsibi:Lity with adequate authorityr to the
Managing Director for day-to-day operations.
5.03      Recent changes have been made in the TOT's management struc-
ture and personnel.  While causingr some temporary unsettlement, the
changes are expected to have a positive impact on TOT's operations.
A new Managing Director was appointed on January 1, 1975.  He is a
knowledgeable engineer and a strong manager. The other senior members
of the organization are competent and well-qualified, many having ob-
tined c?raduiate degrees and/or training abroad.
.olo     TOT has progressively made changes to streamline its organiza-
tion for more effective execution of the devolopment programs and opera-
tion of its services.  The main changes since January 1975 are the
creaticn of a new Department of Plant Engineering, and realignment of
eertain functions between different departments.  For examplo, internal
audit has keen strengthened and transferred from the Departmrent of
Economics and Finance to the Office of Manag:Lng Director as en independ-
ent division.  These changes are in order and will benefit TOT's opera-
tions.
Coordination with PTD
5.o5      lri-hile TOT is responsible for domestic telephone services, the
PTD is responsible for telegraph, telex and all international services.
Although this separation has some disadvantages, the arrangement has
thus far worked reasonably well ir. Thailand. A joint TOT/PTD committee
was set up in 1973 to coordinate the developmental and operational
activities of the two entities. With the future plans of both entities
stressing large scale expansion of their respective services, close
coordination between them will be essential to ensure econoaric develop-
inent and efficienm  operation of the public telecommunication services.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the TOT will maintain,
and strengthen as necessary, the existing arrangements for coordination
between the TOT and the PTD, and that the Government will review these
arrangements to ensure satisfactory coordination and consultation be-
tween all agencies concerned with public telecommunication services in
Thailand.



- 17 -
Coneultants
In March 1973, the "Swedish Telecommunications Consulting AD"
(S&4EDTEL) were appointed to aFsist the TOT in implementation of its
FY72-76 Development Program and in reorganization.  The contract required
SWEDTEL to provide 744 man-months of their servicee up to September 1975
at n cost of US$1,971,000.  The cerformance of the consultants has so far
been satisfactory and as per eurrent program  of work, the consultants would
hava. nomnleted by March 1976 part of their assizned tasks equivlaent to 302 man-
months out of 744 man-months provided in the contract.  TOT haF prepared
a revised schediule of work to conplete the renaining tasks which were
originally expected to use up the balance 14142 man-months in the contract
by extending the contract period up to December 1978.  The original con-
tract price was based on the rate of USQ2,650 equivalent per man-month
during the contract period 1073-75. Because of the extension cf coritract
period, the consultants have now proposed an escalation in the rate per
man-m,onth for period 1976-78 based on 9% annual increase in consumer price
index in Sweden during 1973-75 and anticipated 8% annual iricrease during
1976-78.  Without reduction irn the balance 4l,2 man-months for carrying
out the remaining taslcs, the proDosed eacalation would raise the cost of
consultants' services by 40% and total contract amount to US$2,441,577
equivalent.  During negotiations the revised proposals of the TOT and
the consultants were discussed. It was the Bank's view that TOT would
be able to get the tasks completed within the original price of
US$1,971,000.  It was agreed that the TOT would discuss the suibject fur-
ther with the ccnsultants keeping in mind the Bank's view Anrd  end the
draft of the proposed revision to the contract to the B-n} for review
befo.e finalization.
Staff and Training
.C7       TOT employs a staff of  pp.roximately  8,400 which will increase
to about 13,500 by end of the Project. Annex 16 gives the category dis-
tribution of staff as existing now and as anticipated during the Project
period.  At present, the number of ermployees per 1,000 telephones is 28
(which is less than in most other developing colntries).  TOT expects
this number to reduce to 21t by end of the Project period because of in-
creaFed productivity, economies of scale (increased size of unit instal-
lation) and reorganization of maintenance and construction.
5.08      There is a well-equipped national training center in Bangkol
constructed under a UNDP Project with the assistance of the International
Teleconnunication Union (ITU). The Trairing Center has a capacity for
training bOO personnel of different gradec  at a time in different disci-
plines.  Thirtyr-two of the 57 teaching staff members have received train-
ing ahroad. The Center trains new recruits, and runs special and re-
fresher courses for staff in service, inrluding a course for instructors
in teleconmunications.  In addition, it provides selective training in
finance and management.  Apart from the naticnel training center, each
provincial headquarterstown has its own small training center for train-
ing telephone operators and junior line staff.  TOT supplements the



- 18 -
training oi a selected nunber of senior staff with training abroad or
in the factories of manufacturers whenever new designs of equipment are
introduced in the system. The training facilities are adequate to cater
to the additional staff to be recruited for execution of the Project and
for operation of the expanded network.
Accounting and Audit
5.09      The main weaknesses in TOT's accounting systen are that it lacks
a proper chart of accounts, the works order accounting systen needs im-
proving and the budgetary system needs to be nore fully integrated with
the accounting system.  Br correcting these deficiencies, the management
will be better able to follow up on the progress of the projects and to
better neer're perforrnance against planned objectives.
5.10      TOT, recognizing these weaknesses, requested its consultants
(SWE5DTEL) appointed under the First Telecoimnuriic'ations Project to in-
clude in *ts terms of reference a review of the TOT financial operations
in order to make recommendations for improving the system and to guide
TOT in the implementation process. This review has been completed and
recommendations, which are sound, have been made. TOT, after some delay
during the time of senior management change, is now implenenting the
rsco=mendations under the direction of the Director, Finance with assist-
ance of the consultants.  Progress on the izplementation will be reported
by TOT to the Bank as part of the reporting requirements on the Project.
5.11      The TOT Act stipulates that the National Audit Council (NAC)
will perform TOT's annual audit.  In the past, the NAC audit had been
weak.  In order to assist the NA.C in meeting tho Bank's audit require-
ments, the Bank -orovided a description of the type ard scope of audit
that should be -er:orred and which should be covered in NAC's arnnal
audit re?ort on TOT.
5.12      The efforts of both the TOT and the 1WAC over the past two years
to improve the audit have been considerable as evidenced by the vast
improvement in the 1974 and 1975 audited financial statemente over the
previous years.  The auditor's report, the financial statements and the
supplementary data are well constructed and informative. While there
are still a few areas of the audit that need attention and on which the
Bank has advised both the TOT and the NAC, the 1974 and 1975 NAC audit
based on the financial statements and supplementary data provided by
TOT meets the Bank's requirements. The present; audit arrangements
described in Loan Agreement 864-TIT will continue under the proposed loan.
Insurance
~.13      The Government and TOT have not ir the past seen fit to pur-
ch-ase insurEnce against losses on TOT's fixed assets from typhoons or
oth'r catastrches or from the-more ncrral risks sueh as fire and theft.
Cost of thi.s type of insurance is very high and TOT'F management feels
that th- wide geo-raphical spread of its assets provides r-asonable dis-
-ersion of risk.  This is reasonable for TOT and in line with the approach
adopted by many telecommunications entities in TOT's position.



- 19 -
VI: Finances
Background
6.01      TOT's past operating results have been satisfactory and its
present financial position is sound. The main change taking place is
in the pattern of financing. During the past five years, TOT financed
some 65% of its requirements from internal sources and 35% from bor-
rowings. However, with the increase in amount of investment necessary
for maintaining a reasonable growth rate and for improving the facili-
ties, TOT will be using debt to a greater extent than in the past. Fore-
casts show that 66% of capital requirements over the next four years
will be financed with borrowings and that the debt/equity ratio will rise
fron a conservative 27s73 in 1975 to 60:40 in 1978 and 1979 after which
the ratio is shown to improve. While this ratio is on the high side, the
terms and interest rates of the debt are quite favorable and TOT should
not have difficulty in servicing the debt while carrying out its expan-
sion program.
Tariffs
6.02      The tariff policy as stated in TOT's Act stipulates that in-
come shall be adequate to meet expenses, including maintenance and depre-
ciation, and provide surpluses for debt service and capital expansion.
6.03      As part of the First Project, TOT undertook a review of its
tariffs in order to correct certain weaknesses in the tariff structure,
more specifically: (i) to bring Goverrmient tariffs in line with those
applicable to the public; (ii) to remove the free call allowance, reduce
the montly charge and assess a charge for each call, thereby more equita-
bly relating charges to telephone usage; and (iii) to establish a common
rental for all services, since most service is for business purposes even
though it may be located in a residence. The review also aimed at esta-
blishing a tariff for Subscriber Trunk Dialling at a suitable time before
STD is inaugurated.
6.04      During negotiations, it was confirmed that all the above changes
exceDt the establishment of tariffs for STD became effective on SeDtember 1.
1975. The new tariffs, which are summarized in Annex 17,are satisfactory and
estimated to generate about 20% more revenue annually than the former tariffs.
The STD tariffs are still being worked out and will be sent to the Bank for
review before being finalized. Since STD is scheduled to be introduced
only in 1978, this poses no problem. During negotiations, agreement was
reached that thle TOT will submit to the Bank for its review not later than
June 30, 1977, proposals for STD tariffs before submitting such proposals
to the Government for approval, and that the Government on its part will
take such measures as are necessary to enable TOT to implement the STD
tariffs not later than December 31, 1977. It was also agreed that before
making any further changes in the existing tariffs for local and long-
distance service, TOT would afford the Bank an opportunity to comment on
the changes before submitting them to the Government for approval.



_ 20 -
6.05      With the changes introduced in September 1975, the tariff
level would appear to be satisfactory, with forecasts showing that
TOT would have sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, debt
service, payments to Government (see para. 6.08) and, with subscriber
deposits, would be able to finance 30% of the expansion program. A
rate of return ranging between 10.2% and 11.7% would be achieved during
the period of the construction Drogram.
6.06      During negotiations, agreement was reached that, except as
may be agreed by the Bank, the tariffs will be maintained at a level
to produce revenues, after deducting the payment to Government, suf-
ficient to earn a minimum rate of return of 10% on average net plant
in service.
Past Operations
6.07      Income statements for 1971-1975 are shown in Annex 18.  TOT's
operating results over the past five years have been satisfactory with
operating ratios varying between 67% and 74%. Net operating income as
a percent of average net plant in service ranged from 9.5% to 11.1%.
Operating ratios and net operating income, as well as internal cash
generation, throughout the report are stated on a basis which includes
as operating expense payments to Government equivalent to income taxes,
and bonus payments (see paras. 6.08 and 6.09). On this basis, TOT has
during the past five years fnnanced about 65% of its requirements from
internal sources and 35% from borrowings.
Payments to Government
6.o8      TOT makes annual payments to Government in accordance with a
Cabinet Resolution passed in 1965 that requires state enterprises to
return to Government an amount equal to the amount of taxeF a private
concern pays under the Revenue Code. This payment. which is analogous
to an income tax, amounts to 30% of net income.
Bonuses
6.09      In accordance with another Cabinet Resolution, pertaining to
state enterprises, TOT pays an annual bonus to its staff and members
of the Board of Directors.  The staff's bonus amounts to 9% of net in-
come and the Board's to 2%, with the latter not to exceed a total cost
of B 400,00C (US$19,512). TOT'C management feels that the incentive pro-
vided by this scheme is beneficial, giving staff members a personal
interest in the entity's well being. The bonus payments are treated as
an operating expense in the accounts.



- 21 -
Collections
6.0o      Earlier, while collections from private subscribers were
satisfactory, there was considerable de]ay in settling Goverrnent
accounts for both local and long-distance services. In addition,
Government was paying for local service at a I1o% discount on an
already concessional tariff applicable to Government subscribers.
In respect of local service, the difficulties and anomalies created
by special tariffs and discounts applicable tc Government subscribers
hare been corr9cted. Government is now paying the rental and local
call charger promptly as a result of arrangements made whereby funds
for this purpose are earmarked in the Central Budget. With the intro-
duction of the new tariffs in September 1975, the discount and the
concessional tariff have been eliminated (see paras. 6.03 and 6.oL).
6.11      For other than rental and local call charges, mainly long-
distance service and leased circuits, Government has been in arrears to
the extent that these particular receivables account for some 25% of
total receivables, whereae with prompt settlement they should account
for only about 5%. The delay is due to verification of the use of
long-distance calls in Government departments and to funds not being
earmarked in the Central Budget for this purpose.   The problem of veri-
fication will become even more acute with the introduction of STD. To
overcome this, TOT has accepted the Bank's recommendation to provide
Message Accounting and Automatic Number Identification equipment simul-
taneously with th= STD equipment. This will enable TOT to record particu-
lars,of all STD calls and thus enable verification of such calls. To
further assure prompt payment, TOT has asked Government to apply the same
mechanism of earmarking funds in the Central Budget for long-distance
charges as for rental and local call charges.
6.12      During negotiations, it was agreed that the TOT shall bill the
Government departments and agencies according to tariffs applicable to
other users (para. 6.O4) and that the TOT and the Government will establish
such measures as will ensure settlement by all Government agencies and
departments of their bills for local and long-distance services on a
current basis.
Present Financial Position
6.13      Balance sheets for fiscal years 1971-1975 are at Annex 19.
The book value of assets is realistic, there having been over the years,
with the exception of 1973 and 1974, a high degree of price stability in
Thailand. Also, a high proportion of the assets are relatively new and
reflects current costs. Almost all plant additions have been from TOT's
expansion programs except assets valued at B 50.5 million transferred from
the Posts and Telegraphs Department in 1954 at the time of TOT's formation,
and microwave routes valued at B 352 million transferred by Government in
1966 and 1970. The value of these transfers amounts to about 13% of the
value of plant in service at the end of fiscal year 1975.
6.14      Depreciation has been computed on a straight-line basis, based
on the estimated life of the various catagories of plant in service. Rates
vary from 2% for buildings to 20% for vehicles, resulting in a composite
rate of about 5%. Forecasts assume the same composite rate until 1978 when
a rate of 5.5% is assumed; these rates are realistic.

to invest a large part of its earnings in p;Lant expansion and Government
inr-,estnent in eariier years was provided as equity.  Retained earnings have

6.18      Included as sources of funds are borrowings of B 1,150
million (US$56.1 million) pertaining to Phases I and II, and B 750
million (US$36.6 million) pertaining to assumed future works. The
B 1,150 million are local funds and would be raised through borrowings
consisting of bonds to be purchased by future subscribers as a condition
to obtaining service, from bonds sold to the public and/or loans arranged
through the Government. During negotiations, these financial arrangements
pertaining to Phases I and II of the Program were confirmed. The borrow-
ings are assumed to carry an annual interest rate of 8.5% and a term of
10 years. The B 750 million borrowings for assumed future works
will be arranged in the later years of the Program and comprise B 300
million as local funds, which would be arranged as described above, and B 1x5O
million as foreign funds, which it is assuned TOT will be able to arrange
as in the past on satisfactory terms. Details of other bcrrowings and
further information on the bonds are in AnnexeF 21 and 22 respectively.
6.19      Also included as a source of funds is a B 281.9 million Government
equity investment as part of the total of B 300 million to be providled to
TOT as stipulated urder Loan 864-TH.
6.20      Based on the foregoing assumptions, during the four-year period
1976-1979 the net internal sources of funds, after providing for debt
service and including subscriber deposits, would be equivalent to 30% of
the construction costs including capitalized interest, and working capital
increase; Government equity investment would amount to 4% and borrowings
661J, of which the undisbursed portion of IBRD Loan 864-TH and the proposed
Bank loan would each amaount to B?0. The self-financing of 3C0 of total
requirements is satisfactory, considering that TOT's value of plant in
service is expected to increase by B 4.1 billion (US$0OC :dllion) - an
increase of 1.4 times in four years.
Future Finances
6.21      Forecast income statements and balance sheets for 1976-1981 are
at Annex 18 and 19 and notes and assumptions are at Annex 21. A summary
of operating results for the six-year period is given below:
Year Ending Sept. 30:            1976    1977     1978     1979      1980     1981

6.22      Revenue projections are based on planned average increase in tele-
phone connections and traffic forecasts with allowances for additional reve-
nue from STD service scheduled for introduction in 1978. Expenses are



- 24 
forecast based on the growth of the system and number of staff, with
allowances for increases in wages and cost-of-living allowances and
taking into account past experience. Operating revenues and expenses
are estimated to increase at an average annual rate of about 22%. On
the basis cf the six-year forecast, rates of return are between 10.2%.
and 12.1%.  This is satisfactory, parti-.ularly when considering that
TOT will be paying part of its net income to Govermnent as the equiva-
lent of the income tax normally paid by a private concern. Before
deductinz this payment, the corresponding rates of return would be be-
tween 13.2% and l5.1%.  The operating ratio would be satisfactory at
betweern 68% and 76%.
6.23      The forecast financial position is satisfactory.  The debt/
equity ratio is shown to increaee from 27:73 in 1975 to an acceptab]e
maximum of 60:40 in 1978 and 1979.  The current position (ratio of current
assets to current liabilities) would be satisfactory as would the
annual coverage of debt service byT internal cash generation.
Debt Limitation Covenant
6.24      Loan 864-TH includes the Bank's normal debt limitation covenant
which permits the Bank to monitor TOT's debt position. ForecaFts show
that TOT may need to seek the Bank's approval for non-Bank debt incurred
during the construction period. Tmhe debt/equity ratio, which should be
maintained below 65/35, will be a major factor in the approval decision.
The proposed loan wiJ-   continue the same covenant stipulating a 1.5
times debt service coverage of maximum future debt service by internal
cash generation.
Fiscal Impact
6.25      The fiscal impact of TOT"s operations on Government over the
eight-year period (FY72-79) will be favorable. Estimates showi that
Government benefits by taking in El 2,2214 million as a result of TOT',
operations; this compares with TOT receiving B 282 mrillion fromr Govern-
ment (see Annex 23).
Performance Indicators
6.26      Indicators given in Annex 24 will help monitor TOT's future
perf crmance.

1/ Differrn3es between nuzber of complaints reported by subscribers and
number of faults cleared on those complaints is due to "repeat" complaints
and complaints due to transient faults which disappeared before the lines
could be tested.
2/  This does not include faults detected by maintenance staff on inspec-
tions or routine tests. Also, the number of faults cleared is less thar
lines tested faulty du3 to large nurnber of transienit faults.
3/ The number of exchange faults cleared on routine test of equipment for
the same perJod was 5 per 1,000 lines per month.  90% of the exchange faults
were cn 20,000 lines of old step-by-step exchange equipment due to be re-
placed by end of 1975.

Return on Investment
Project Period
1.        In calculating the internal financial rate of return,
a study period has been taken corresponding to the mean life of
the various items of plant making up the project (Phases I and
II), which are assumed to have a composite life time of 20 years
commencing in 1975.
Costs
2.        The estimated project costs exclude import duties and
taxes on TOTK' imports as well as price contingencies.  The
average rate of import duties is 30% and taxes are paid at the
rate of 11%.
3.        The operating costs were estimated from the income
statement by assuming that operating expenses, excluding depre-
ciation, per exchange line added under the project are attribut-
able to the pr,ject.
Revenues
14.       The estimates of subscriber deposits are based on the
number of lines connected under the project.
5.        Local service and other revenues were estimated from
the number of lines connected under the project, and assuming
that the exchange fill relating to these lines would reach 90%.
6.        In forecasting toll revenue, it was assumed that the
existing toll plant would be saturated by 1976 and that subse-
quent increases in toll revenue, up to the date when the circuits
provided under the project would be fully utilized, are the re-
sult of additions made under the project. The increases in toll
revenue after 1976 have been related to the forecast grcwth in
traffic, including the stimulus expected in 1079-80 resulting
from the introduction of subscriber toll dialing.

THAILAND
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND (TOT)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
Balance Sheet - Annex 19
Plant in Service and Depreciation
1.        Estimated plant in service, 1976-1981, is based on the annual
investment program detailed in Annex 6 and assumed future works. The
basis for charging depreciation is stated in para. 6.14 of the report.
Assets were transferred to TOT from the Posts and Telegraphs Department
during the period 1954-1962 valued at B 50.5 million, and from the
Government in 1966 and 1970 valued at B 351.9 million. In addition,
the Government has over the years provided TOT with funds for investment
amounting to B 112.3 million, making a total Government investment
equivalent to US$25.4 million. Plant retirements are deducted from both
the plant account and depreciation reserve. Salvage from retirement is
either sold or taken to stores. Plant recovered and reinstalled is
recorded in the books at its estimated depreciated value. In the case
of any premature retirement of plant, the plant account and depreciation
reserve account will be reduced only to the extent of the estimated
expired life of the asset.
Plant under Construction
2.        The forecasts assume that the amount of plant under construc-
tion each year will be the sum of 50% of the plant under construction in
the previous year plus the construction prograia during the current year.
This was discussed and apreed with the officinls of TOT'ls PnginoerinR
and finance departments.
Cash
3.        Forecast cash balances are derived from the Sources and
Applications of Funds statement and amount to an average of four months' cash
operating expense.
Subscriber Accounts Receivable
4-        Forecasts assume that with improved collections from the
Government, the amount of anuiual subscriber accounts receivable will
be Aquivalent to about six weeks' billings.
Inventories
5.        Forecasts assume that inventories will amount to B 450 per
connected exchange line.



ANNEX 21
Page 2 of 4 pages

8.        Government investmert consists of funds made available to TOT,
assets transferred from both the Posts and Telegraphs Department and
Government (see paragraph 1 of this annex), and in future from Govern-
ment taking up equity in TOT (see paragraph 6.19 of the report).
Subscriber Contributions
9.        Subscriber contributions represent a small amount of equip-
ment purchased by subscribers which became the property of TOT.
Retained Earnings
10.       Retained earnings each year consists of the sum of retained
earnings of the previous year plus net income transferred to retained
earnings in the current year.

million equivalent, consisting of outstanding borrowings as follows:
(i)  Japan Exim Bank - B 507.0 million (US$24.7 million equiva-
lent) at annual interest rates of 5% and 5.75% and terms
of 18 and 20 years, including 5 and 7-year grace periods;
(ii)  Bell Telephone Manufacturing Comparn  - B )40.9 million

lent) at 7:4% annual interest rate and a term of 20 years,
including a 4-year grace period.



ANNEX 21
Page 3 of 4 pages
12.       Further borrowings during the remaining period of the program
1976-1979 are aF follows:
Loans Obtained
(i) Japan Exim Bank - undisbursed balance of B 1,380 million
(US$67.3 million equivalent) at interest rates of 4%, 5%,
and 5.75% and terms of 18 and 20 years, including grace
periods of 5 and 7 year.
(ii) IBRD Loan 864-TH - undisbursed balance of B 512.1 million
(US$25.0 million equivalent) at 74 interest and a term
of 20 years, including a 4-year grace period.

(i) Proposed second IBRD loan - B 533 million (US$26 million
equivalent) at 8.5% annual interest and a term of 20 yearF,
including a 4-year grace period.
(ii) Local fund borrowings of B 1,150 million pertaining to Phases
I and II to be raised fromX bonds to be purchased by future
subscribers and the balance from bonds sold to the public and/or
arranged through Government at an annual interest rate of 8.5%
and a term of 10 years.
(iii)  Borrowings for future works totaling B 75C million (US$36.6
million) are assumed to be available as in the past and at
similar terms (see para. 6.18 of report).
Current Liabilities
13.       Current liabilities include accounts payable, accured expenses,
the 30% payment to Government and bonus payments for the current year
(payable the following year) and other current liabilities. Forecasts
assume accounts payable to amount to 15% of the local fund portion of the
annual capital investment.
Advance from Subscribers
14.       In order to augment funds for capital expansion, TOT hae at
different times instituted schemes whereby a new subscriber was required
to make a lump sum payment.  In one of the sch.mes the payment was
B 15,000: B 500 for the cost of connection, B 1,500 set deposit, and
B 13,000 as prepaid telephone rental. This scheme was in effect a few
years when Government abolished it. More recently, in June 197h, TOT
invited applications for telephone service in the metropolitan area where
new service had become available; an advance payment of B 2,500 was



ANNEX 21
Page 4 of;14 pages
required. The number of applicants exceeded the available service
and TOT is in the process of making a refund to the unsuccessful
applicants.
Subscriber Deposits
15.       This is a non-interest bearing deposit made by each nev
subscriber (B 3,000 in Bangkok and B 1,500 in the provincial areas)
and is refundable upon disconnection of service. The annual total
of these deposits is the sum of the deposits at the end of the pre-
vious year plus deposits collected during the current year less
refunds made during the current year.
Statements of Income - Annex 18
Operating Revenue
16.       Operating revenue includes (i) local revenue (telephone,
rental, call charges, installation fees and rental of auxiliary
equipment); (ii) toll revenue (domestic and international); and
(iii) other revenue (yellow page advertising, fees for extra main-
tenance and installations). Forecast revenues are based on planned
average increase in telephone connections and traffic forecasts  nd
reflect the new tariffs that became effective on September 1, 19T7.
Operating Expense
17.       Forecasts for staff remuneration, maintenance expense, and
other operating and administrative expense (wages for temporary
workers, fuel, and overhead expense) are based on the growth of the
system and number of staff, with allowances for increases in wages
and cost-of-living allowances and taking into account past experience.
Depreciation in the past has been calculated at a composite rate of
about 5% on average gross plant in service at the end of the year.
The same rate is used for the forecast.
Bonus Payments
18.       Bonus payments (see para. 6.09) are calculated on net in-
come and are considered as part of the remuneration paid the
staff and Board of Directors and are treated as operating expense.
Payment to Government
19.       The payment to Government equivalent to income taxes (see
para. 6.08) is assumed to continue at 30% of net income.
Other Income (Net)
20.       Other income (net reflects interest earned on TOT's deposits
o0  cach and foreign exchange loss on long-term debt.  After fiscal year
19W75, TOT is not expecte>i to have cexcers cash and therefore other income
is shown to be nil.

Bond Issues
Included as a source of local currency funds are TOT bor-
rowings of B 1,150 million pertaining to Phases I and II of TOT's
program and B 300 million pertaining to assumed future works. These
funds will be raised through borrowings consisting of bonds to be
purchased by future new telephone subscribers as a condition to
obtaining service, from bonds sold to the public and/or loans arranged
through Government. The extent to which the two latter sources are
used would depend upon the amount that TOT will be raising from sub-
scriber bonds.
TOT in the past has experimented with selling subscriber
bonds and is confident that this is a good source of funds to help
fill the local currency financing gap. TOT calculates that with
the number of subscribers to be connected in different parts of the
country, and with the bonds to be priced at B 30,000 and B 10,000
for the Bangkok area depending on whether the purchaser desires tele-
phone connection within eight months or later, and at B 1,000 and
B 3,000 for the provincial area, depending upon the si~ze of the ex-
change, it will be able to raise as much as B 370 million during
fiscal years 1976 and 1977 and B 750 million during 1978 and 1979.
Estimates show that the provincial areas would account for about 7%
of the total to be raised and the Bangkok area about 93%.
To the extent that subscriber bonds would fall short of
providing the required local funds, bonds would be sold to the
public and/or equivalent funds arranged through Governi.ent. While
the public bonds would be a new source of funds for TOT, EGAT has
successfully issued bonds of this nature in substantial amounts.
The procedure has been one where Government has in effect guaranteed
the success of the issue by arranging for a group of financial insti-
tutions to accept the entire issue, which is then sold to the public
and any remainder purchased by the institutions.

Fiscal Impact of TOT's Operations on Government (1972-1979)

1972-1975 operations, the fiscal impact of TOT's operations on
Government will be favorable. During the period 1972-1979 Government
wiU benefit by taking in B 2,224 minlion as a result of TOT's opera-
tions; this compares with TOT receiving B 282 million from Government
