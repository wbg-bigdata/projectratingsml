PEOPLE'S REPUJBLIC OF THE CONGO
THIRD HIG2       PROJECT. LOAN 2227-COB
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
bvaluation Summary
Obiectives
1.        The main  objective  of  the  project was institutlon bullding and
training which concentrated on the two pilot areas where unpaved roads would
be rehabilitated  and maintained.  The project  included: (a) a 3.5 year time
slice of a rehabilitation and maintenance program for unpaved roads in two
pilot regions (Pool and Cuvette) through the establishment of three mechanized
brigades, three grading units  and mobilized  crews  for  nuunal maintenance,
through establishment or improvement of workshops and through the provision of
laboratory equipment for soils and materials testing; (b) technical assistance
to RNTP for the training of maintenance personnel, for strengthening its
*capacity to plan and manage  road maintenane, and  for  the  management of
mechanical workshopsg (c) technical assistance for highway planning and for
development of a local construction industry; and (d) the refinancing  of PPF
No. P-136 COB.
=Imlementation Experieneo
2.        As the  project  consisted  of  a  time-slice of rehabilitation and
maintenance works, time rather than quantity of work determined when the
project was completed. As the Governmont only partially mot its financial
commitment to the project, only 452  of the  planned physical works were com-
pleted by the end of the 3.5 years time-slice period when the project came to
a stop.
3.        The overall economic rate of return (ERR) for the project was about
242 at appraisal.  ERRs of the eleven roads built under the project range from.
-112 to 1682 (para 21).
Results  Sustainability and Findinrs
4.        Points of particular interest highlighted in  the project completion
report are:
(a)  Although less  than half of the physical road works envisioned were
carried out, the project substantially met  its lnstitution building
objectives by  strengthening the  executing agency's (RNTP) capacity
,      to maintain roads  in  two  pilot  regions,  and  by  establishing a
training unit capable of carrying out similar training programs in
-A



- vi -
other  regions  of the  country. Under the circumstances, the
overall performance of the  project  as  considerod reasonably
good (par. 22).
(b) The project was defined as a Itim-slice- of a rehabilitatlon and
maintenance program to be carried out by a specLfied number of force
account brigades.    Because  of experience with shortage and delays
in counterpart funding under provious loans and confirmed by this
project, it might have been more appropriate to specify Individual
rehabilitation works and carry  them out under contracts  for which
the  financing  plan was  complete  prior to  initiating the works
(para 19).
(a)  The project provides usefvl lessons for the Bank  e d the  b  ais 5or
follow-up projects.  The project has demonstrated to the Goverment
how to plan. economically-justified rehabilitation and maintenanee
programs and has allowed RNTP to develop its institutional capabill-
ties for carrying out such programs  in an  efficient manner.  These
lessons have bean incorporated in the follow-up road rehabilitation
and maintenance project now under preparation.   In  this project,
emphasis is being placed on defining comprehensLve maintenance
programs and specific rehabilitation works as well as a project
financing plan which takes past experience with counterpart funds
into account (para 23).
5.        The Goverment indicated to the Bank that it had no objection to the
project completion report.

PEOPLE*S REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT, LOAN 2227-COB
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.  I1TRODUCTION
1.        The Bank Group  has been closely  involved with upgrading
highway maintenance In the Congo since 1969 when It financed a Road
Engineering Project.  This project  included a study for a highway
maintenance program. This was followed by a smll Righway Improvement
Project in 1970. and a Hlghway Kaintenance Project In 1971 based on the
recommendations  arising  from  the above study.  The  latter project
consisted of a  four year  country-wide highway maintenance program
Including consultant services to help reorganize the Public Works
Department, advise on highvay maintenance and assist with equipment
repairs; and procurement of some maintenance equipment and spare parts
to repair existing equipment. The PCR prepared in 1978 noted that the
project had made some contributions to hlghway maintenance, but the
overall performance was disappointing. It concluded that the project
was especially handicapped by a shortage of local funds and an underes-
tlmtion of technical needs. The Third Highway Project was designed as
a demonstration type institution-building effort concentrated In two
regions of the country, with the view that a pilot demonstration of
proper road maintenance could eventually be expanded thsoughout the
country. Both aintenance projects were executed by the R4gie Nationale
des Transports et des Travauz Publics (RNSP), an autonomous agency in
the Ministry of Public Works, Construction, Urban Affairs and Housing.
II. PROJECT IDEMTlFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.        The Third Hlghway Project was Identified in 1974 and was
appraised first in April 1976 as a four year country-wide highway
maintenance program. Because of the shortage of counterpart funding
which delayed completion of the preceding project, and on the grounds of
poor national economic management leading to an Inability to meet local
costs of a new project, further processing of the project was suspended
late in 1976. In 1979, the Government undertook an IMF stand-by program
and a number of other measures which led the Bank to conclude, early In
1980, that it was appropriate to resume project preparation. While the
Government had taken steps to resolve the problem of insufficient
funding, the poor condition of maintenance equipment and weaknesses In
the management of the RNTP, was a concern. In May 1980, the Bank made
available a PPF of US$125,000 to finance studies to determine RNTP's
specific needs for maintenance equipment and technical assistance, and
their cost.



-2-
3.        The  studes  provided the basis  for a reappraisal  in Ap-
ril 1981. By that time, the need for road maintenance in the Congo was
so large that the proposed project could only partially meet demands.
For that reason, two pilot regions were selected to gain experience in
organizing and executing a maintenance program which could be subse-
quently introduced in other regions.  By selecting the Pool region in
the south and the Cuvette region in the north, the Government tried to
maintalu a regional balance In rehabilitating the country's road net-
w?wo1r!.
-          4.        Concern was expressed In the Issues Paper that the project
scope was constrained by the absorption capacity of RNIP, in particular
the limited manpower available for executing the maintenance program.
The Government was platning a large paved roads construction program for
which it was in the process of buying construction equipment.  The
manning of this equipment would pose a heavy demand on the already
scarce manpower resources of the country. This concern led the Bank to
send a special mission to the Congo to assess the Government's capacity
to implement the paved roads program by force account.  The Bank con-
eluded that the Government's assumption that force account work vould
*          result in a 301 savings over contracting the vorks, was doubtful and
that it would be more effective to carry out the paved roads program
through contracts.
S.        As a result of the Bank's recomuendations, the Government sub-
stantially reduced its paved roads program and decided to have nart of
it carried out by contract.  To further protect the maintenance %roject
from diversion of equipment, technical staff and funds, the Baut pre-
pared an action program for the implementation of the road maintenance
program in the pilot regions which was agreed on at negotiations. The
Action Program specified in detail the number and composition of the
working units to be employed in the two pilot programs, the number of
kilometers to be rehabilitated and maintained, the staffing for each
unit, and the annual budget requirements for each of the two pilot
-          regions.  Lastly, to further encourage the Government to contract out
construction, the proposed project scope was amended to include techni-
cal assistance to help develop the domestic construction industry.
6.        The main objective of the project was institution building and
-*         training which concentrated on the two pilot areas where unpaved roads
would be rehabilitated and maintained.  The project included:
(a)  a 3.5 year tine slice of a rehtsilitation and maintenance
program for unpaved toads in twc pilot regions (Pool and
Cuvette) through the establishment of three mechanized bri-
7      gades, three grading unit. and mobilized crews for manual
maintenance, through establishment or improvement of workshops
and through the provision of laboratory equipment for soils
and materials testing;
A
(b)  technical assistance to RNTP for the training of maintenance
personnel, for strengthening its capacity to plan and manage



-3-
road maintenance, and for the management of mechanical vork-
shops;
(c)  technical assistance for highway planning and for development
of a local construction industry; and
(d) the refinancing of PPF No. P-136 COB.
7.        The. loan vas negotiated in April 1982, but was not signed
until January 20, 1983, because of the need to resolve a problem con-
cerning the negative pledge clause which arose after the decision to
proceed with a loan, rather than a credit as originally intended. A
condition of effectiveness was the appointment of consultants to provide
technical assistance. The loan was not declared effective until Septem-
ber 26, 1983. mostly attributable to slov processing of documents on the
part of the Borrower.
1II   PROJECT IWPLEDENTATION
A. General
S.        Despite the delay in effectiveness, the project got off to a
good start. The Goverrment appointed the consultants at the beginning
of 1983 and by mid-1983, tenders for equipment had been called, con-
struction of the workshop was well untervay, and training had been
started. Hovever, a decline in the Congo's oil revenues led to delays
in local currency paymuents which slowed down the vork. By late 1983,
bidding for the equipment,  including evaluation of bids,  had been
completed.  Unfortunately,  the Government's  financial situation had
worsened, and the Bank made the ordering of equipment and co-financing
of workshops and stores conditional upon the Government's depositing
CFAF 321 m into a special account to cover one year's operating cost of
the project. This procedure had not been required originally when the
project was negotiated, and it took the Government until early 1985 to
set up the account. The equipment for rehabilitation and maintenance
was delivered between mid-1985 and early 1986, over one year later than
originally  scheduleJ.   This delay  substantially  contributed  to the
reduction in physical output to about 45S of what was originally planned
because the loan funds allocated for the overhead costs of the project,
technical assistance and workshops, ren out in accordance with the time
slice definition of the project which ended in October 1986. Except for
the delay, procurement of equipment was carried out in line with Bank
guidelines. The cost of the equipment was noted as being considerably
mess than normally the case in the Congo.
B. Civil Works
^             9.         Grading, rehabilitation and regravelling was confined to two
pilot regions. The originally scheduled program in comparison to that
actually accomplished is shown in Table 1. The delay in the delivery of



-4-
equipment  (para 8),  and  the  Government's  increasing  difficulty  in
providing annual counterpart funds, led to further deterioration of the
road network s.nce appraisal, necessitating more extensive rehabilita-
tion than foreseen at the time the project was prepared.  As a result,
the mileage of roads completed under the project was somewhat less than
half  that  scheduled.  Despite  these problems,  about  50-70% of the
targets were achieved in the Pool Region and 25-552 of the targets in
the Cuvette Region, or about 452 overall.  As regards regravelling,
248 km of road out of 310 km scheduled were finished despite the late
availability of most of the trucks, an 802 completion rate for this
important periodic maintenance operation.  Under the above circumstanc-
es, the performance on civil works is considered reasonable. As regards
the construction of shops and stores, the central workshops and two
-'         regional workshops were completed under the project.  A larger training
center to replace an inadequate facility was also built and equipped
under the project. Unfortunately, most of the staff trained under the
project have been laid-off; however, many could be quickly recalled.
C.  Technical Assistance
10.       The technical assistance component included training of local
personnel as  equipment operators  and  foremen  for  road maintenance
operations, and mechanics and  supervisors  for the workshops.  The
training program was successfully executed due in large measure to the
efforts of the consultants. Considerably more than the 400 employees of
the UNTP originally envisaged under the project were trained in various
skills. During tne last year of the project, the RNTP was able to focus
some attention on road maintenance outside thc project areas with the
assistance of the consultants. However, output was handicapped by the
general shortage of funds.
11        The technical assistance consultants carried out a study of
the domestic construction industryi Including the preparation of a
program to assist the industry. Local construction capabilities were
Identified and minor subcontracting of maintenance of bridges and
culverts was started.  The consultants also provided assistance  to
prepare a maintemance and rehabilitation program, a strategy for extend-
ing road maintenance nationwide, and the economic justification of each
of the roads in the investment plan. Again, the work done to date
should provide a useful basis for a future project.
Accounting
12.       In June 1983, for the first time, a Bank financial analyst
visited the project to review RNTP's accounts and found the general
levgl of both accounting procedures and record keeping inadequate. He
resommended adding a technical assistance component to improve financial
management and accounting standards within RNTP. This was agreed and by
February 1984, a consultant had analyzed the problem of the RNTP and
recommended new procedures and controls.  It was intended that addition-
al technical assistance to implement these procedures and train local
personnel be made available, but in view of the increasing financial



5
constraints facing the project. this work had to be deferred. However,
following the consultant's initial recommendations, changes were made to
RNTP's financial management which resulted in some improvement in this
i           area.  There remains considerable scope for further improvement and this
uthould be provided  for in any future road project.  The project's
accounts, which were later audited, were satisfactorily kept by the
consultants.
Costs
i           13.       As the project consisted of a time-slice of rehabilitation and
maintenance works, time rather than quantity of work determined when the
project was completed.  At the time of completion,  the total funds
expended on the project overran the estimated costs at appraisal by
about 4S. However, as the Government was unable to make available its
1986 budget for the project of ClAF 360 a, the real cost would have been
somewhat higher if budgeted funds had been provided. Costs of regra-
ealling per km, lnciuding equipment depreciation and technical assis-
tance, averaged about US$6,000 for a 10 to 15 cm overlay, a figure
considered reasonable in the context of the Congo.   Rehabilitation,
which included clearing shoulders and reshaping the roadway, ran to
about US$2700 per km while grading of rehabilitated and regravelled
roads cost about US$200 per kn. These costs compare reasonably well
with those estimated at the time of appraisal, after adjustment for
Inflation and further road deterioration due to the delay in starting
the project (para 8).
14.       The cost of technical assistance was higher than anticipated.
At negotiations, about one third of the loan funds was allocated for
technical assistance or about 242 of the total estimated cost of the
project. Because of the one-year delay in availability of equipment,
together with minor additional technical assistance costs for computeri-
zation of stocks and accounting. and the failure of the Government to
provide all of the local currency needed for operating expenses, the
cost of technical assistance finally amounted to 362 of the total cost
of the project.  Under the organizational set-up, the cost of technical
assistance was an overhead cost with little scope for adjustment in case
of shortage of operating funds.  While th  cuts in the local currency
budget necessitated a cut in the scope of physical works executed, the
other components of the project, financed mostly out of the loan, were
fully completed.  The infrastructure for personnel training is now in
place, and the experience gained in setting up maintenance organizations
in two regions provides a basis for accurately estimating the costs of
maintaining the roads in the other regions of the country.

IV. CONSULTANTS
15.       The  consultants,  who provided  technical assistance  to the
RNTP, performed well.  Their initial contract was for 300 man-months,
but this was subsequently extended to 450 man-months.  Each expatriate
was assigned counterparts from RNTP to carry on after their departure,
in particular at the operational level in the workshops and in the
field.  As noted in para 9, most of the counterparts have been laid-off,
but many are expected to return to work when called b#c!.  The consul-
tants produced progress reports and a completion report on the execution
of the project which were satisfactory. The auditors (an international
firm in association with a local firm) satisfactorily carried out the
accounting study of the RNTP and the auditing of the project accounts
kept by the consultants. Their report on the latter work indicates that
the accounts are generally in order.
V   BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
16.       The Borrower's performance was mixed; the Government only
partially met its financial commitment to the project; but RNTP, the
executing agency, performed reasonably well under the circumstances, and
the Ministry of Public Works even diverted funds from its own programs
to maintain project momentum, when possible. The RTP and its Central
Directorate of Equipment, which is responsible for the operation of the
central workshop and spare parts stores, were the prime beneficiaries of
the project.  Good experience  in the operation and maintenance  of
equipment was gained as well as benefits in the way of training and
on-the-job experience, thus building up RNTP's capability for further
expansion.
VI. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
17.       Counterpart funding problems in the Congo were apparently not
anticipated during the appraisal of the Th:'rd Highway Project, despite
similar experience in previous projects, because of the Government's
high oil revenues at the time.  This is presumably the reason why a
special account was not required at negotiations.  The preceding Highway
Improvement Project had suffered delays when local funding became tight
(para 1), and the same problem was encountered shortly after the Third
Highway Project got underway (para 8).
is.       Whether it was wise for the Bank to hold up the procurement of
the equipment for over a year until lczal funding was made available, is
difficult to judge. However, in retrospect, it certainly contributed to
the delay in getting the field work underway and the Borrower's failure
to meet  the physical  targets.  Following  the establishment of  the
special account,  the physical works progressed without  interruption
.1q



-7-
until the end of 1986 when the Government was once again unable to
provide the replenishment it had promised and operations stopped. Since
the loan account was depleted at that time, the Bank lacked the leverage
to force release of these funds.  Adequate conditionality for counter-
part funding and revolving funds should be part of any follow-up opera-
tion.
19.       Given the experience with counterpart funding, it does seem
surprising that the project was defined as a "time-slice" of a rehabili-
tation and r'aintenance program rather than as a program of specific
works. While the description of the project did spell out the works,
the time-slice appears to have governed in setting the project costs and
the items to be financed by the Bank. Thus, at the end of the period.
when all the items financed from the loan funds had been implemented as
scheduled, the items to be financed from insufficient counterpart funds
could only be completed for about half the anticipated target. At the
end of the time-slice period, the works had to be stopped because of
lack of loan and counterpart funds, and the crews demobilized. In view
of the delay in procurement, and the delays in making counterpart
funding available, the Bank might have tried harder to negotiate a
one-year extension of the time-slice or have a follow-up project immedi-
ately. However, because of the general financial constraints in Congo
at the time of completing this project, it is unlikely that better
results could have been achieved. By May 1987, the financial situation
in Congo had become more clear and a PPF to continue maintenance while
preparing a follow-up operation has been started.
20.       The Bank closely supervised the project with an average of
about four supervision visits per year. It quickly responded to the
financial problem when it arose by pressing the Government for a solu-
tion.
VII. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
21.       The overall economic rate of return (ERR) for the project was
estimated at about 241 at appraisal; ERRs were not determined for
individual roads.  The local currency shortages discussed above have
affected the progress in improving eleven roads, two of which were not
fully completed.  It was therefore more appropriate to assess the ERRs
on individual roads.  Table 2 shows tuhat the estimated ERRs of the
eleven roads range from -11% to 1682.  They are based on costs of
construction and overheadp and benefits related to savings in vehicle
operating costs. Four out of the eleven roads in Table 2 have an ERR
ress than the prevailing opportunity cost of capital, four have satis-
'factory ERRs and three have ERRs far in excess of the opportunity cost
of capital. Two out of the four roads with unsatisfactory ERRs had not
been completed, and it is therefore, not surprising that their ERRs are
* not satisfactory.  It is not clear why two other roads have unsatisfac-
tory ERRs; however, it may well be that insufficient attention was given
'             to  the  development  of  agricultural  activities  in  their  areas  of
,',



-8-
influence. The roads with the higher ERRs demonstrate the viability of
Improving roads in areas with agricultural potential.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
22.       Although only about 45% of the physical road works envisioned
were carried out, the project substantially met its institution building
objectives by strengthening the RNTP's capacity to maintain roads in the
two pilot regions and by establishing a training unit capable of carrv-
ing out similar training programs in other regions of the country.
Under the circumstances, the overall performance of the project is
considered reasonably good.  Additional benefits of the project were the
introduction of sound procurement practices, which led to better prices
than normally obtained lh the Congo, a start on the development of a
local road construction industrv, and some improvement in accounting
practices.
23.       The project provides useful lessons for the Bank and the basis
for a follow-up maintenance project which should be easier to implement
now that the RNTP has acquired the experience of executing the pilot
program.  The project has provided the background information such as
costs, timing and equipment input needed to prepare the next project.
Any follow-up proj ect should require that the Government budget provide
the necessary local currency funds, that these be placed in a special
account in accordance with an agreed schedule (para 18), and that most
of the rehabilitation and maintenance program be executed on the basis
of contracts for which the financing is fully secured.
24.       The project demonstrated that force account operations  for
road works are feasible, but at high overhead costs. Given the uncer-
tainties about local funding and the loss of trained staff from RNTP due
to intermittent funding, it is more efficient and less costly to place
more emphasis in future on contract-based maintenance and construction
works.
25.       In a telex dated Februarv 12, 1988, the Government indicated
that it had no coument on the PCR (Annex).
