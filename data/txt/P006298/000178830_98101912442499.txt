BRAZIL
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
COPEL SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Brazil in 1978
was 109,733 M.T.o.e. (0.93 T.o.e. per capita, compared to about 0.79 T.o.e.
per capita for Costa Rica and 1.6 T.o.e. for Mexico) 1/ and it is expected to
grow at about 6% per annum in the next 5 years, reaching about 1.11 T.o.e.
per capita in 1983. Oil products account -or about 42% of the national energy
consumption, mineral coal, wood products and wastes 32% and hydroelectricity
26% (see Annex 1).
1.02      Brazil's proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic produc-
tion of crude covers only 15% of the country's requirements and is concen-
trated in the Northeastern region. To increase domestic production Government
accelerated exploration in 1977 by granting risk type contracts to private
concerns, putting an end to government monopoly in this field. Bituminous and
sub-bituminous coal reserves which are located in the Southern region are
estimated at about 3,200 million tons. Coal extraction is rather costly
because shaft mining is predominantly required. Nevertheless, coal is an
important fuel used in thermal generating plants in the South; recent proposals
of the State of Rio Grande do Sul envisage two major power projects with open-
pit mining and one coal gasification project with underground mining.
1.03      Brazil has vast water resources with a potential for hydroelectric
development estimated at about 200,000 MW, of which only about 21,600 MW have
been utilized. An additional 35,000 MW are scheduled to be in operation by
1990. Many watersheds could be developed economically but they are relatively
remote from the demand centers. In addition to the future hydroelectric
plants, 3,000 MW of nuclear generating capacity has been scheduled for 1985
operation in the Southeastern region, the largest demand center in the country.
The first unit of 600 MW, supplied by Westinghouse (USA), is expected to
operate in 1980. The Brazil-West Germany agreement of June 27, 1975 provides
for the supply of an additional 2,400 MW in nuclear plants and a Brazilian
option for six additional 1,200 MW units. The configuration of major generat-
ing and associated transmission facilities in Brazil has few load concentra-
tions. Under pronounced differences in regional hydrological regimes,
electrical interconnections could economically substitute or attenuate
complementary thermal generation.  This diversity exists between the Southern
and Southeastern regions and a high voltage interconnection is under construc-
tion and being financed with Loan 1343-BR to ELETROSUL. Other electrical
interconnections are being considered by sector authorities leading towards
least cost intraregional investment programs.
1/   T.o.e.:  tons of oil equivalent, approximately 10  kcal; M.T.o.e. =
1,000 T.o.e. Data source: Ministry of Mines and Energy, Balanco
Energetico Nacional of 1978.



1.04      With respect to other energy sources, firewood, charcoal and sugar-
cane bagasse are also used but not for electric public service. Firewood is
used only in some small industries and for cooking in rural and some urban
low income households. Charcoal is also used for cooking, in blast furnaces
and steel mills. Bagasse is burned to produce steam in sugar milling. These
fuels represent about a quarter of Brazil's energy utilization and would
probably not increase. Among other energy sources of lesser current signifi-
cance in Brazil is natural gas, with apparently small reserves in Northeastern
fields for local supply.  There are few sites for tidal energy development,
and geothermal fields have not yet been discovered. Brazil has been active
in exploring alternative energy sources; the largest endeavor, in the use
of alcohol as fuel in internal combustion engines.  In the power sector, tests
are being conducted on wind-driven generators and on use of electricity for
public service that was obtained in association with production of steam in
a petrochemical plant.
1.05      In 1978 electricity generation amounted to 110,000 GWh; its annual
rate of growth since 1973 has been 11% with per capita consumption in the
same period going from 550 to 830 kWh.
Energy Use in the Southeastern and Southern Regions
1.06      The Southeastern region, with 42% of Brazil's population accounted
for about 71% of the total electricity utilized in the country in 1978. The
Southern region, with 18% of the population utilized 12%. The two regions,
where most of the country's agricultural and industrial production takes place,
used in 1978 about 80% in all energy forms. In the last five years, electric
generation in the Southeastern region grew at 11% p.a. and at 15% in the
Southern region.
1.07      The Southern region, comprising the States of Parana, Santa Catarina
and Rio Grande do Sul has an area of 577,723 sq km, or 7% of the Brazilian
territory; Parana has about half the population of the region and in 1978
utilized about 5% of Brazil's electricity generation.
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.08      Since 1949 the Bank has made 31 loans in the Brazilian power sector.
Most have been for hydroelectric plants and associated transmission facilities
in the Southeastern and Southern regions. Bank participation has contributed
to sector organization and planning and facilitated foreign commercial finan-
cing of the sector. Bank lending has also assisted Government in its effort
to implement a tariff policy which has enabled the sector to contribute a
considerable proportion of the funds required for sector investments. Project

performance audit reports on power plant 1/ and distribution system 2/ projects
have been distributed to the Executive Directors. These reports state that,
despite construction delays and cost overruns, the projects were substantially
successful.
1.09      The most recent loans have been for transmission and distribution
projects: Loan 1257-BR of May 1976 to COPEL for its 1976-1979 distribution
expansion program; Loan 1300-BR of August 1976 to ELETROBRAS for the system
expansion programs of three Northeastern utilities; Loan 1343-BR of February
1977 to ELETROSUL for its high voltage transmission project, and Loan 1538-BR
of May 1978 to ELETROBRAS for the system expansion programs of three state-
owned utilities; two in the Southeastern reRion and one in the South.
1.10      The proposed loan, which would be for subtransmission and distribu-
tion would be the second to COPEL, and would build on the experience acquired
under the previous loan (para. 2.09). As in the first loan, Bank participation
is principally oriented towards providing financing for least cost procurement
of project equipment and materials, as well as effectively facilitating foreign
commercial financing of the sector through cofinancing arrangements. In
addition, the agreements on the proposed Bank loan would encourage expansion
of rural electrification and electricity services to urban low-income house-
holds in the State of Parana.
Sector Organization
1.11      Though complex and one of the largest in the world, the sector is
well organized and the policies well formulated and applied. Decree 68204
of June 7, 1967 estabished the current sector arrangement, wherein the
Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE) performs regulatory
functions, grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions, sets
tariffs and approves expansion plans; Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras
(ELETROBRAS), a holding company for those utilities owned by the Federal
Government, administers public funds for use by its subsidiaries and state-
owned utilities, and coordinates external borrowings, expansion plans for
major generating and transmission facilities, and operation of interconnected
systems in the country's network.
1.12      The five geographical regions are served by ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries
(bulk suppliers), in conjunction with state-owned utilities (principally in
distribution) as follows: Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil (ELETRONORTE)
for the North and part of the Central-West; Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao
Francisco (CHESF) for the Northeast; Furnas-Centrais Eletricas (FURNAS) in
the Southeast and part of the Central-West; and Centrais Eletricas do Sul do
Brasil (ELETROSUL) for the South. A joint Brazil-Paraguay authority (Itaipu
Binacional) has responsibility for the Itaipu hydroelectric project, under
construction on the Parana River where it defines the border between the two
1/   Loan 404-BR (Sec.M 77-532 of June 28, 1977); Loans 442-BR and 566-BR
(Sec.M 78-34 of January 13, 1978).

countries. In January 1979, the Federal Government, through ELETROBRAS,
acquired from Brascan Ltd. of Canada about 83% ownership of LIGHT, the distri-
bution utility serving the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
1.13      Government guidelines contained in the 1967 decree (para. 1.11)
promote concentration of public electricity services in the individual states
into single state-owned utilities. The resulting action produced mergers and
acquisitions by the major state-owned companies of most municipal and privately
owned utilities. The main existing state-owned utilities, ranked in value of
assets, are: Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo (CESP); Centrais Eletricas de
Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica (COPEL);
Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE) - Rio Grande do Sul; Centrais
Eletricas de Santa Catarina (CELESC); Companhia Eletrica da Bahia (COELBA);
Companhia Eletrica de Pernambuco (CELPE); and Companhia Eletrica de Ceara
(COELCE).
Tariffs
1.14      Consumer bills contain the following charges:
A.   On a nationwide basis, tariffs provide about 78% of revenues collected
from consumers. According to current legislation, these charges
should be set at levels to cover:
(a)  operation, maintenance and administrative expenses;
(b)  taxes other than for income (mainly property taxes);
(c)  foreign exchange losses arising from foreign exchange
borrowings;
(d)  straight line depreciation of average gross revalued
fixed assets in operation;
(e)  reversion (federal tax of up to 5% of assets in operation
to fund loans to concessionaires for facility expansions,
compensation of private utilities for acquisition of their
assets, and the Global Guarantee Fund--a tariff equaliza-
tion facility); and
(f)  a legal return (normally between 10 and 12%) on remunerable
investment (net average plant in service plus an allowance
for working capital).
B.   The sole tax on residential, commercial and small industrial 1/
consumer bills which provides about 12% of sector revenues. From
this source 40% goes to federal sector agencies, 50% to state and
federal district utilities, and 10% to municipal utilities; and
C.   The Compulsory Loan (10% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers of more than 2,000 kWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding
6% and revalued through monetary adjustments).
1/   Industries utilizing less than 2,000 kWh per month.

1.15      In 1973 DNAEE initiated application of a policy to reduce regional
tariff inequalities in order to promote a more balanced economic development.
By 1976, with minor exceptions, average tariff levels had been equalized.
The Global Guarantee Fund (GGF) was used in the tariff equalization process
through distributions to eligible utilities to supplement their earnings,
allowing them to obtain a return on remunerable assets up to 10%. The GGF
is financed through a surcharge of up to 2% on assets in operation of all
the utilities. DNAEE has used its control over the GGF to encourage improved
performance by participating utilities. To be eligible for transfers from
the Fund, utilities are required: (i) to have a valid agreement with the
state government where they operate for the payment of all bills in arrears
by the state government agencies; and (ii) when owned by the federal, state
or municipal governments, and these have assumed a legal obligation to reinvest
their dividends into the utility, to have all such dividends reinvested.
1.16      Under Loan 1257-BR COPEL agreed to maintain its earnings (including
transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund) at levels consistent with sound
financial public utility practices and in accordance with existing legislation.
COPEL also agreed to maintain its eligibility under norms prescribed by DNAEE
in the event it requires transfers from the GGF, and Government confirmed
the Bank's understanding that DNAEE would allow COPEL a return on remunerable
assets of at least 10%. Furthermore, any change in legislation which would
materially and adversely affect COPEL's financial position would be an event
of default. The same conditions have been agreed for the proposed loan.
1.17      In connection with the proposed loan, the Government has informed
the Bank that: (i) in fixing the annual remuneration to be allowed to con-
cessionaires, DNAEE recognizes all reasonable costs of operation, administra-
tion and maintenance, taking into account the service characteristics of the
concessionaire and the feasibility of increasing its efficiency; (ii) DNAEE
will provide to the Bank, by July 31, 1979 comprehensive information regard-
ing the criteria being applied in determining whether a utility's service
costs are to be recognized; and (iii) DNAEE will exchange views with the Bank
regarding the foregoing, and will inform the Bank of any changes in such
criteria.
1.18      The legislation summarized above has been used to establish power
tariffs which have enabled most of the Brazilian utilities to attain a reason-
able return on invested capital and allowed them to finance a considerable
share of sector investments. Present tariffs also contain generally appro-
priate features such as separate demand and energy rates for industrial and
commercial consumers, discounts to encourage large industrial consumers to
accept supply at higher voltages, and life-line rates for rural and minimum
residential consumption. However, the tariffs do not provide for differentia-
tion between peak and off-peak rates, and the equalization feature warrants
reassessment. There are also some indications that current tariff levels may
need to be raised. In order to ensure that the tariffs would provide adequate
revenues, to evaluate the economic effects of pricing policy and to consider a
new rate structure design, DNAEE, with Electricite de France assistance, is
undertaking a comprehensive study. Under Loan 1300-BR, Government agreed to
present to the Bank the results of the study, expected to be completed by
mid-1979.



-6-
Existing Facilities
1.19      By the end of 1978 the power sector had about 25,200 MW of installed
generating capacity of which about 86% was in hydroelectric stations and the
remainder in thermal plants (one-third in oil-fired steam units, about 15% in
coal-fired units and the remainder in diesel internal combustion and gas units).
The high voltage transmission system contains about 34,000 circuit-km at
voltages ranging from 230 to 500 kV.
Coordination of Operations
1.20      In order to achieve the most economic operation of interconnected
systems, Government established regional coordinating groups (Grupos
Coordenadores para Operacao Interligada - GCOIs); in July 1973 for the South-
Southeastern regions and in March 1977 for the Northeast. In these groups,
the regional operating utilities under ELETROBRAS coordination plan and carry
out improved allocation of loads to generating stations, compensate for
diversity in regional load peaks and hydrological regimes and control opera-
ting costs through reductions in operation of thermal plants, by higher use
of hydro facilities.
Access to Service
1.21      About 80% of Brazil's urban population is receiving electricity
service.  However, the number of people receiving this service in the rural
areas (where about 40% of the population lives) is very low. Government is
promoting expansion of subtransmission and distribution facilities to provide
electricity service to a higher proportion of the population, particularly in
rural areas. The proposed loan would contribute towards this objective in the
State of Parana.
Rural Electrification
1.22      Rural electrification on a national level was started in 1970 when
the Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria, a self-governing
agency attached to the Ministry of Agriculture, was made responsible for the
planning, promotion and control of rural electrification through consumer
cooperatives. Progress, however, was slow (4 to 5 thousand customers/year)
and in 1974, ELETROBRAS created a rural electrification department to comple-
ment the Ministry of Agriculture's activities. ELETROBRAS' approach to rural
electrification has been that of financing distribution networks in rural
areas close to existing lines. It does not finance household wiring or
connection fees. ELETROBRAS finances 50 to 80% of the cost of individual
rural electrification projects at a subsidized interest rate of 12% (principal
not subject to monetary correction) with 15 years maturity including a grace
period of 5 years. This results in a large subsidy given inflation rates
much in excess of the interest rate charged. The remaining cost is borne by
the utilities or by consumers. The Ministry of Agriculture's program (which



-7-
has been assisted by two Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) operations
totalling US$84.4 million, including US$68.7 million of funds provided on
concessionary terms) grants similar terms to participating rural electrifica-
tion cooperatives.
1.23      About 43,000 rural customers (about 200,000 people) were connected
in 1978 through ELETROBRAS-assisted programs and at a total cost of about
US$100 million. Of these new customers, about 44% were located in the South-
eastern region and 43% in the South. Over the period 1979-1981 ELETROBRAS
expects to participate in projects estimated at about US$570 million, and
provide services to about 160,000 new rural consumers (45% in the Southeast,
32% in the South, 3% in the Central-West, and 19% in the Northeast and 1% in
the North), thereby providing services to about 800,000 people.
Sector Development
1.24      No constraints have been observed in sector organization that could
adversely affect continued sector development. The high level of investment
required in the sector (about 9% of the country's gross capital formation) and
the Government's present policy of limiting public sector investments as
part of the program to control inflation may, on the other hand, affect future
sector investment programs. In connection with Loan 1538-BR, ELETROBRAS
expects to complete by the end of 1979 a master plan for sector facility
expansions to the year 2000. This plan should permit assessment of various
solutions for maintaining adequate service reliability while adjusting long-
range investment programs affected by Government actions to curb inflation.
1.25      More serious constraints could arise in the future if utilities are
unable to obtain revenues sufficient to appropriately contribute to their
own expansion programs. This concern has prompted DNAEE to review sector
financial requirements and tariffs. This study is being carried out together
with a review of rate structure which has been agreed with the Bank (para.
1.18). DNAEE expects to present to the Bank by mid-1979 the results of
these reviews, including an integrated financial forecast for the sector
through 1985.

2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The borrower would be Companhia Paranaense de Energia Eletrica -
COPEL, a joint-stock corporation which is the major public service electric
utility in the State of Parana. COPEL was established by State Decree 14-947
of 1954 and charged with the responsibility for planning, building and devel-
oping systems of generating, transmission, transformation, distribution and
sale of electric power in Parana. Before COPEL was established, the electric
power sector in the State of Parana was very fragmented.  Service was provided
by Companhia Forca e Luz do Parana (CFLP), 1/ a subsidiary of American and
Foreign Power Inc., as well as by a number of smaller private companies and
municipal entities.  There was no coordination of planning to provide electric
power service in the State because of the multiplicity of concessionaires and
the absence of a central coordinating authority; the quality of service was
poor because national tariffs then in effect did not provide the utilities
with sufficient revenues for expansion and also because the utilities did not
have technically qualified staff in sufficient numbers. The decision to
establish COPEL, thus, grew out of the recognition on the part of the Parana
state authorities, of the need for a more effective organization arrangement,
for better coordination of electric power service within the State. COPEL has
grown very rapidly since its inception and has acquired most of the other
power utilities in Parana; it currently supplies about 90.5% of the electri-
city services in the State. At year end 1978, COPEL had 6,382 employees, its
installed generating capacity amounted to 420 MW and it had total assets
valued at about US$780 million. Its voting capital stock was valued at
Cr$3,741 million (US$207.8 million) of which the State of Parana, its munici-
palities, and agencies owned about 86%, ELETROBRAS 13%, and other entities the
remainder.
Organization, Management and Staff
2.02      COPEL's organization is well structured (Annex 2 shows the organiza-
tion chart). General policy directives are set by a 7-man Administrative
Council elected for a 3-year term by the General Assembly of shareholders.
Current members of the Administrative Council include three representatives
from the Parana state government--the state secretaries for finance, for
planning and for commerce and industry; one from private industry in Parana;
one from ELETROBRAS and two officers of COPEL--its president and its financial
director. The diversity of the composition of the Council brings the necessary
depth and broad perspective to decisionmaking in the Council while the
presence of the two key COPEL officials provides an important link between
policy formulation and implementation within the company. The utility is
managed by a six-member Board of Directors appointed by the Administrative
Council, consisting of the President and the directors of COPEL's five depart-
ments. The organization of the company also includes an independent 3-member
Fiscal Council, elected by the General Assembly, to advise on the corporation's
accounts and proposed capital increases.
1/   CFLP was acquired by ELETROBRAS in 1964.  It was the borrower for Loan
476-BR, which has been assumed by COPEL.



2.03      COPEL is organized along functional lines:  there are five depart-
ments each headed by a director. The departments are: Administration,
Economic and Finance, Distribution, Operations, and Engineering and Construc-
tion. Each department has two or three subdivisions headed by a superintendent.
COPEL's regional operations covering Curitiba, Ponta Grossa, Londrina, Maringa
and Cascavel come under the Distribution department. This organizational
structure is similar to those in other Brazilian distribution companies and
works well for COPEL.
2.04      COPEL's policy of systematically identifying, training and promoting
staff from within has enabled the company to build up a core of competent
upper and middle management. Several of the upper and middle management
personnel, including the president and some directors, rose through the ranks
within the company. At year end 1978, COPEL's permanent staff numbered
6,382; about 50X were professionals. Through a program of carefully recruiting,
placing and training its work force, COPEL has been able to build up an
efficient, well motivated and competent work force. COPEL's policy of identi-
fying the potential of its staff through appropriate evaluations and training
them accordingly for higher positions has resulted in a rather stable work
force. Despite absorption of several smaller and less efficient utilities in
recent years, COPEL has been able to achieve steady increases in its customer
to employee ratio which was 98 in 1975 and 124 in 1978. COPEL has a well
designed training program covering its supervisory, technical and financial
personnel. In 1977, about two-thirds of the permanent staff participated in
in-house or external training programs. COPEL has also been a beneficiary of
the training program financed by the Bank under Loan 1343-BR and administered
by ELETROBRAS. COPEL is expected to carry out a satisfactory training program
during the project's execution.
Management Information Systems and Audit
2.05      COPEL's financial planning and budgeting systems are good.  Its
financial forecasts have been computerized and tie in with its technical and
market forecasts. COPEL prepares 10-year financial plans and an annual budget
covering projected expenditures for capital investment and operations. These
are supplemented by several auxiliary budgets including its borrowing needs,
projected debt service and cash flow. Through a computer model, which allows
projections of its daily cash needs, COPEL is able to keep its cash balances
to a minimum and to borrow efficiently.
2.06      COPEL's internal reporting and management information system is
also good. It has established a modular linked computerized system covering
its customer accounting, payroll and personnel administration, accounting,
property control, financial control, inventory management and transport
management. Operating and financial reports are prepared accurately and
promptly.
2.07      COPEL has a well staffed internal audit division under the Financial
Director. The division carries out a program of continuous audit and internal
controls on all aspects of the company's operations. The internal audit
program is satisfactory. The independent Fiscal Council (para. 2.02) reviews



- 10 -
all financial transactions of the company. COPEL's financial statements have
been audited and certified by Arthur Andersen and Company annually. The scope
of the audit is satisfactory. COPEL should agree to continue to appoint inde-
pendent external auditors satisfactory to the Bank and to send to the Bank
audited financial statements and the auditor's report within four months of
the end of its fiscal year.
Billings and Collections
2.08      COPEL's billing is part of its computerized information processing
system. Bills are rendered monthly and are due 15 days after receipt.
Through strict enforcement of its disconnection policy COPEL has been able
to bring down its outstanding receivables from an unsatisfactory 83 days sales
at year-end 1975 to 68 days sales at year-end 1978.1/ Outstanding accounts
receivable are expected to remain satisfactory throughout the execution of
the project.
Performance under Loan 1257-BR
2.09      COPEL's performance under the ongoing Bank-financed project (Loan
1257-BR) has been satisfactory. Engineering designs, preparation of equip-
ment specifications, and supervision of project works have been carried out
by COPEL's staff. COPEL used the services of CABEB for the preparation of
bidding documents for ICB procurement of Bank-financed items and for
fabrication inspections. Project execution has been smooth, but completion
may be delayed by about 3 months due principally to initial administrative
difficulties in the preparation of bidding documents.

3. THE MARKET
General
3.01      The State of Parana, in Brazil's Southern region, has an area of
199,554 sq km and, though situated on the Tropic of Capricorn, its climate is
varied. The Northern, Western, and Eastern zones are tropical, while the
Central and Southern, due principally to higher terrain, are temperate.
Parana has a population of 9.8 million (42% urban, 58% rural), close to 8% of
the country's total; and about one million people live in Curitiba, the state
capital. Parana's share of Brazil's agricultural production represents about
25% (soya 31%, cereals 20%, cattle 15%, coffee 10%, cotton 6% and potatoes,
sugarcane and various other products 18%).
3.02      In the early sixties, Parana had primitive electricity services;
per capita utilization amounted to 23 watts (86 watts for Brazil as a whole)
and total generation in 1961 amounted to 660 GWh, compared to more than seven
times as much (4,940 GWh) in 1978, when total utilization in all energy forms
amounted to the equivalent of about 5.9 million tons of oil, or 5.4% of the
country's total (see Annex 1). Of the total electric energy utilization,
COPEL supplied 90.5%, captive plants 8%, and small public utilities the
remainder.
Sales Forecast
3.03      From 1973 to 1978 COPEL's sales grew at an average annual rate
of 22% and from 1979 to 1983 a growth rate of 15.9% is forecast. The main
factor contributing to the relatively high growth rates has been the sub-
stantial development of the industrial sector, which in 1978 accounted for
41% of total sales, while residential sales amounted to 20% and the commercial
share was 15%; the remainder went to rural, government, and public service
customers. The relative market share of the industrial sector (75% agro-
based) is expected to continue to grow during the project period, as shown
below. During the period 1980-1983 the total number of consumers is expected
to increase by about 400,000 (335,000 residential, 35,000 rural, and 30,000 in
other categories.

3.04      Except for large industrial consumers, the above forecasts were
prepared essentially on the basis of population trends in the State and well-
recorded consumption indices. Exponential equations were derived to project
requirements by categories for the period 1978-1987. In order to define forecast
figures using averages and standard deviations, several study hypotheses were
developed. In each hypothesis, a random form of population evolution was
estimated. Through the population estimate and historical consumption rates,
a series of per capita consumption rates were evolved. The forecast figures
were also adjusted to reflect market saturation effects.
3.05      With respect to large industrial consumers COPEL received service
requests from 60 concerns, totalling 320 MW for the period 1979-1983. Of these
requests, 50% of the firms have signed supply contracts with COPEL and the
remainder, letters of intent. The probability that these loads will materialize
during the period is estimated at 85%, which is reflected accordingly in the
forecast.
3.06      The analysis to define the sales forecast was comprehensive and
thorough and reflects well-substantiated trends, and the results have been
reviewed by ELETROBRAS and approved by DNAEE for COPEL's system expansion
planning. Because COPEL has maintained good market statistics and its dis-
tribution planning staff is well experienced in this field, the Bank selected
this utility to carry out a case study in 1978 for the formulation of a fore-
casting procedure and studies to define economic system reliability levels. 1/
The case study performed jointly by Bank staff, consultants and COPEL staff
proved successful and the Bank will publish a book by year-end 1979 on the
case findings. Also as a result of this work, COPEL has initiated implemen-
tation of the forecasting methodology and economic analysis. However, due
to the recent completion of this work and the time they would need (about 2
years) to phase it into their planning programs, it was not applied in prepar-
ing the current forecast.
3.07      Under Loan 1257-BR COPEL is carrying out a program to provide
electricity services to about 20,000 low income households. For purposes of
this program, low income households are defined as those within COPEL's
concession area which, though located near existing feeders or distribution
circuits, are not served because of their inability to pay for connection fees
(about US$100). In order to provide service to these households, COPEL
financed the connection charges without interest and for a period of three
years. This program was also coordinated with state government urban devel-
opment agencies.  The results of this undertaking have been much more favor-
able than expected and COPEL will extend it during the project period to
45,000 additional low income households covering approximately 225,000
people; the Bank obtained assurances from COPEL and state authorities that
the new program would be executed.

- 13 -
3.08      Although COPEL's expansion program for the period 1979-1983 is well
balanced and designed to appropriately provide forecast service requirements,
service to the rural areas could be expanded. Of the 3.7 million rural
inhabitants, about 128,000 (3.5%) have electricity service. Under current
planning (covering the period 1980-1983), which is based on the expected
availability of subsidized credit for rural electrification, COPEL expects to
connect about 35,000 new rural customers, representing about 175,000 people,
close to one-and-a-half times the number presently served. However, this
figure could be increased to about 50,000 consumers without requiring an
increase in COPEL's staff or straining its financial position, provided COPEL
obtains the borrowings included in the financing plan on reasonable terms
(which is expected to be facilitated by the proposed cofinancing arrangements).
Through this effort, the number of rural inhabitants with electricity service
could be nearly tripled in three-and-a-half years. COPEL agreed to prepare
and implement a program to provide services that would permit about 50,000
connections to new rural consumers during the project period; the program
should be presented for Bank review by November 30, 1979.
Energy and Capacity Balance
3.09      The requirements for electricity supply by COPEL and its energy
purchases (primarily from ELETROSUL, the regional bulk supplier), have been
forecast under the assumption that COPEL would gradually reduce its own con-
sumption and system losses by 1983. COPEL would be capable of meeting its
energy needs and power requirements from its own plants and purchases from
ELETROSUL under average hydrological conditions (see Annex 3). Hydrological
conditions in 1978 were below average and some rationing of electricity
services was applied. As a consequence, year-end sales were 243 GWh (6%)
lower than expected. These conditions have since improved and current sales
figures confirm the accuracy of the original forecast for the first quarter of
1979. Forecast figures for the period 1979-1985 have, therefore, not been
modified. ELETROSUL is familiar with COPEL's demand forecast and has current
contractual arrangements to supply these requirements. ELETROBRAS, ELETROSUL
and COPEL review these requirements about every six months and through past
experience have been able to adequately adjust system operation schedules to
maintain service reliability.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background
4.01      The relatively rapid economic growth of the State of Parana, which
became stronger since the early seventies and closely linked with industrial
development in the state, produced proportionate increases in demand for
electricity services provided by COPEL. Expansion of COPEL's electric system
was planned to meet this demand and implementation of the first program
covering the period 1976-1979 is scheduled for completion by mid-1979. The
first Bank loan (1257-BR) to COPEL partially financed the distribution system
expansion in this program and was instrumental in the execution of a plan to
provide electricity service to about 20,000 low income households. The second
major expansion program would be initiated in July 1979 and completed by
mid-1983. The project proposed for Bank financing would comprise the program's
subtransmission and distribution facilites which are needed to supply the
required reliable electricity services. Bank particiption would also be
instrumental in expanding rural electrification and services to an additional
45,000 urban low-income households.
Generation
4.02      COPEL owns and operates 23 hydro and thermal generating plants with
an aggregate installed capacity of 420 MW (390 MW hydro and 30 MW thermal)
which provide about 35% of COPEL's system generation requirements.
4.03      COPEL's Foz do Areia hydroelectric plant (1,674 MW), under construc-
tion and partially financed by the IDB, constitutes an integral component of
the 1975-1990 least-cost generation and transmission expansion program for
the South and Southeastern regions that was prepared by ELETROBRAS in December
1974. ELETROSUL's Salto Santiago hydroplant, also under construction and with
partial financing by the IDB, is part of the same program. By 1981 these
plants will be linked to a 500 kV transmission system which in addition to
providing an interconnected grid in the Southern region will also be connected
to the Southeastern regional grid and, before commercial operation of Itaipu
(1983/1984), supply complementary generation to that region. The 500 kV
interconnection is being financed under a Bank loan (1343-BR) to ELETROSUL.
The original 1975-1990 program undergoes periodic updating, and the proposed
second loan to COPEL would give the Bank an opportunity to review any major
investment in generation or high voltage transmission that COPEL may consider
to undertake and not included in the utility's 1980-1983 program described
below. Thus, the Bank could contribute towards attaining compatibility in
sector investments.
The Program
4.04      COPEL's 1980-1983 construction program comprises the following
works:



- 15 -
(a) Generation - completion of the Foz do Areia hydroelectric project -
1,674 MW; expected completion of first stage 1981; 2,512 MW ultimate
capacity;
(b) Subtransmission - substations: improvement and installation of
about 1,320 MVA of transformer capacity at 230 kV, 400 MVA at
138 kV, and 450 MVA at 69 kV; lines: 360 circuit-km at 230 kV,
480 circuit-km at 138 kV, and 140 circuit-km at 69 kV;
(c) Distribution - improvements and installation of about 470 MVA
of aggregate transformer capacity at 34.5 kV, 13.8 kV, and lower
voltages in distribution transformers; installation of lines at
34.5 kV, 13.8 kV aggregating about 2,850 circuit-km, expansion of
feeders, distribution circuits, street lighting fixtures (102,300
new units), consumer meters (410,000 new units) and about 400,000
new service connections, including some 45,000 for urban low income
households and 35,000 for rural consumers;
(d) Communications and control equipment - expansion of communications
and control facilities and equipment for system operation;
(e) General plant - expansion of the electric center laboratory and
physics and chemistry laboratories, operations and maintenance
equipment and materials for subtransmission and distribution
systems, tools and equipment for electromechanical shops, motor
vehicles and office equipment and civil works related to
expansion of administration and abovementioned facilities; and
(f) Rural electrification - an aggregate of about 17,500 circuit-km
of lines at 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV to provide connections for about
35,000 new rural customers. 1/
Program Costs
4.05      The cost estimate of the 1980-1983 expansion program appears in
Annex 4.1 and is summarized below:

1/   As noted in para. 3.08, this portion of the program would be increased
and program costs would rise accordingly.



- 16 -
The above estimate, which does not contain price contingencies and was pre-
pared by COPEL on the basis of a well-balanced program and prices prevailing
in June 1978, is considered to be sound and realistic.
The Project
4.06      The program containing the project proposed for Bank financing has
been defined, considering priority facilities that would permit COPEL to meet
the rapid growing demand with reliable service. The project, consisting
mainly of subtransmission and distribution works to be initiated by January 1,
1980 and completed by June 30, 1983, would represent about 55.7% of COPEL's
1980-1983 investment program and comprise the following facilities (details
appear in Annex 4.1):
(a)  Subtransmission
Substations: improvements and installation of about 1,300 MVA of
transformer capacity at 230 kV, 380 MVA at 138 kV, and 440 MVA of
69 kV; lines: 320 circuit-km at 230 kV, 380 circuit-km at 138 kV,
and 110 circuit-km at 69 kV;
(b) Distribution
Ci)  line extensions at 13.8 kV and 34.5 kV aggregating about
2,250 circuit-km;
(ii)  installation of about 6,900 transformers (34.5 kV-13.8 kV/
220-120 V) with an aggregate capacity of about 410 MVA:
(iii)  installation of about 590 km of 13.8 kV feeders;
(iv)  improvement of about 1,300 circuits at 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV
(340 m average length);
(v)  installation of about 1,360 new circuits at 34.5 kV
and 13.8 kv (340 m average length); and
(vi)  installation of about 410,000 watt hour meters (315,000
single phase and 95,000 polyphase);
(c) Auxiliary facilities
Ci)  modernization and enlargement of metering, general electrical
equipment and chemistry laboratories;
(ii)  subtransmission and distribution maintenance and operation
equipment, tools and equipment for electromechanical workshops;
and

(d) Consultant services
for preparation of bidding documents (100 staff 1/-months)
and equipment fabrication inspections in and outside Brazil
(145 staff-months).
Project Cost Estimate
4.07      The project's estimated cost is US$361.7 million; the foreign cost
amounts to US$161.8 million (44.7%), part of which would be financed with the
proposed loan. The project cost estimate was prepared by COPEL's engineering
staff using as a basis equipment and material prices, as well as installation
and construction costs, obtained from contracts recently made under COPEL's
current project (Loan 1257-BR), adjusted to prices prevailing in June 1978,
plus the assumption that about 50% of the contract values would be won by
Brazilian manufacturers. Items financed by the Bank are exempt from taxes or
duties. Taxes on items procured locally and not financed by the Bank amount
to about US$16 million, or about 4.5% of project cost. The consulting services
required for equipment fabrication inspections outside Brazil were calculated
on the basis of equivalent expenditures for ongoing project items (Loan 1257-BR)
and amount to about 72 staff-months, estimated at US$5,000/staff-month, exclud-
ing subsistence and travel expenses. Adding these expenses, the corresponding
figure would be US$8,100/staff-month. The foreign cost of subsistence, travel,
and miscellaneous expenses for COPEL's inspection supervisors has been estimated
at US$217,000. A thorough and comprehensive analysis was carried out by COPEL
to define sound project base costs. Physical contingency allowances of 5% for
equipment and materials and 10% for equipment installation and civil works
have also been used. These values are considered appropriate in relation to
the type of project involved and degree of accuracy of the base cost estimate.
4.08      Allowances for price increases have been incorporated in the cost
estimate using the following annual percentages and at a constant (Cr$18.0/US$)
exchange rate:

4.10      The proposed Bank loan would finance equipment and materials suitable
for procurement under ICB, as well as the foreign cost of equipment fabrication
inspections. The estimated cost of the equipment and the foreign cost of the
inspection, including price contingencies, but not interest during construc-
tion, is US$109 million, which would be covered by the proposed Bank loan.
Implementation
4.11      As in the ongoing project (Loan 1257-BR), COPEL's own staff will
carry out engineering designs, prepare specifications for equipment, materials
and works, as well as supervise construction for the whole project. COPEL
will continue to use the services of its consultant, Companhia Auxiliar de
Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras (CAEEB) for complementary services in the
preparation of bidding documents for IcB procurement of project items and in
related fabrication inspections. COPEL's technical staff has demonstrated its
high professional performance in the diligent and well-managed execution of
the ongoing project, expected to be completed, with minor delays, by mid-1979.
4.12      Project subtransmission and distribution works will be spread
throughout the State of Parana (para. 3.01) and most of these works will be
executed concurrently. Consequently, they are not suitable for effective and
economical handling by a single contractor. COPEL, therefore, expects that
state-based contractors (of which there are many qualified to perform the work)
will submit the winning bids for these works. Installation of major equipment
will be done in most instances by the suppliers, under COPEL staff supervision.
Some construction and equipment installation will also be performed by COPEL's
own forces. The abovestated arrangement has worked effectively and economi-
cally in the implementation of the first project; through the experience
recently gained with it by COPEL, higher performance in the execution of the
proposed project should be attained.
1/   US$20.24 million for items financed by the Bank.



- 19 -
4.13      In the first project (Loan 1257-BR) bidding documents were jointly
prepared by COPEL's staff, which was unfamiliar with ICB under Bank guidelines,
and CAEEB, their consultants in this work who had the necessary experience.
The main objective in this arrangement, proposed by the Bank, was to provide
an effective transfer of knowledge to COPEL's staff in this field and in that
of equipment fabrication inspections. The period to implement this arrange-
ment and issue well-prepared bidding documents was longer than orLginally
foreseen. This delayed procurement of Bank-financed items, requiring adjust-
ments in the scheduling of some project works and introducing a considerable
lag in the initial loan disbursements. This lag has recently been substan-
tially reduced but completion of the project is expected to be delayed by
about three months; final loan disbursements may require a corresponding
extension of the closing date.
4.14      COPEL's staff is now fully capable of handling the preparation of
all bidding documents and supervising equipment fabrication inspections.
However, COPEL will continue to use CAEEB's services to complement its staff
when necessary. Since project items are similar to those for the first
project, bidding documents for most of them are ready and the sets of documents
could be issued shortly after loan approval.
4.15      By mid-1979, COPEL's 1976-1979 expansion program would be substan-
tially completed and its 1979-1983 program initiated. The project to be
financed with the proposed loan comprises facilities to be initiated not
earlier than January 1, 1980 and completed by June 30, 1983 (para. 4.06).
Annexes 4.2 and 4.3 contain the project implementation schedules, which will
serve as a basis to monitor project progress.
Procurement
4.16      Procurement of equipment, materials and instruments to be financed
by the Bank will be through international competitive bidding (ICB) and in
accordance with guidelines for procurement under Bank loans. Special imported
metering and system protection and operation equipment that is not appropriate
for ICB because of the advisability of maintaining standardization would
be acquired through direct purchases at an estimated cost of US$3 million.
Miscellaneous imported items required in small quantities, and therefore
not suitable for ICB, would also be imported and purchased directly through
international shopping (US$2 million). The aggregate cost of direct purchases
amounts to US$5 million.
4.17      Based on the outcome of ICB recently completed for COPEL's first
distribution project (Loan 1257-BR), about half of the value in contracts
is expected to be won by Brazilian suppliers. Bids for equipment and materials
to be financed with the proposed loan that contain elements of Brazilian
manufacture, equal to at least 50% of the bid price, would be given a margin
of preference of 15%, or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower.



- 20 -
4.18      Items not financed by the Bank loan include equipment and materials
which are unlikely to attract foreign bids under ICB. Bulky items such as
concrete poles and cross arms, construction materials, as well as miscellaneous
low voltage switches, connectors, lighting fixtures are examples of this
category of goods, which COPEL would procure in accordance with its normal
competitive bidding procedures which are satisfactory. In the unlikely
event that foreign bidders would wish to participate in the supply of these
items, COPEL would not be eligible to receive import licenses for such goods
unless financing of more than 15 years' maturity is available from sources
other than the Bank.  A sufficient number of local suppliers and contractors
are available to expect a satisfactory degree of competition. The total cost
of these items (including price contingencies) is estimated at US$132 million,
with a foreign component of about US$44 million.
Disbursement
4.19      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed as follows (disbursements
will be fully documented):
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and materials,
including foreign costs for their installation, and the ex-factory
cost of locally manufactured equipment and materials; and
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment fabrication inspections
outside of Brazil.
4.20      The estimated schedule of disbursements is based on the formulated
procurement program and actual experience with Loan 1257-BR to COPEL. Dis-
bursements are expected to proceed at the rate shown below:

- 21 -
The closing date would be June 30, 1983 to coincide with the expected date
of project completion, because no retention of payments are envisaged (equip-
ment performance would be guaranteed through appropriate bonds).
Environment
4.21      COPEL has carried out previous projects with due regard to environ-
mental protection. Under the proposed project all high voltage line routes
have been selected to skirt urban concentrations, and clearing of rights-of-
ways would be kept to a minimum. The terrain traversed by the lines is rela-
tively flat and natural drainage patterns would not be affected. Distribution
system rehabilitations, particularly of feeders and disarrayed overloaded
aerial circuits will be executed with special attention to safety and, in
congested urban zones, reduction of adverse visual impact.
Project Risks
4.22      The execution of project works does not have associated risks aside
from those normally inherent in this type of work for construction crews,
particularly in transmission line construction and energized line work in some
distribution system installations. However, COPEL's construction supervision
staff is highly experienced in this work and applies stringent safety standards;
their low accident record is excellent. Construction schedules have been
defined on the basis of normal and well-recorded progress attained by COPEL
on similar projects; consequently, major delays in project execution are
unlikely.

5. FINANCES
Financial History and Present Position
5.01      Compared to other utilities in the Brazilian power sector, COPEL's
financial performance has been good, reflecting the effectiveness of its stable
management and its operating efficiency. Annexes 5.1, 5.2 and 5.9 give data
on COPEL's financial performance during 1975-78. During this period COPEL
achieved a 10% rate of return on its revalued "remunerable assets." Its
average financial rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets in
operation, achieved during the period, was about 14.6% which is quite satis-                  
factory.  Consumer-based resources financed about 22%o of total investment
during the period which is reasonable considering that the capital investment
undertaken, including Foz do Areia, was quite large. These results fell
somewhat short of those forecast in the appraisal report for Loan 1257-BR
(16% financial rate of return and 25% self-financing, respectively).
5.02      COPEL's financial management has been good.  By means of a computer-
ized cash flow forecast which enables it to estimate its cash needs on a daily
basis, COPEL has been able to keep its cash balances at a minimum while
temporary cash surpluses are invested in short-term securities. At the end
of 1977 COPEL's debt/equity ratio was 41/59 which provides a reasonable margin
for borrowing. COPEL's capitalization at December 31, 1977 was as follows

Local currency loans represent about 75% of COPEL's outstanding debts.
ELETROBRAS is COPEL's major creditor accouting for about 77% of the local
indebtedness. About 40% of the outstanding foreign currency loans are owed
to commercial banks. While COPEL's ratio of debt to equity financing is
conservative for a power company, the terms of COPEL's past loans are short
compared to the useful life of the related assets. The weighted average re-
payment period for COPEL's outstanding debt is about 11 years, while the average
economic life of the assets they financed is about 33 years. This disparity
could result in cash flow problems for COPEL unless it is offset by high
levels of equity financing. It will, therefore, be necessary for the Bank
to scrutinize COPEL's financing of its investments during project implementa-
tion.
5.03      Accounts receivable from customers, which had been high in the
past because of delays in payments by state government agencies, is now at
a reasonable level. It declined from the equivalent of 83 days sales at year
end 1975 to an estimated 68 days sales at year end 1978. This improvement
resulted from a reduction in the billing lag and strict enforcement of the
disconnection policy. COPEL is currently implementing a program to further
reduce the billing lag in order to achieve further improvements in its outstand-
ing receivables. The ratio of receivables to billings will continue to be
monitored during the project's execution.
5.04      Notwithstanding COPEL's relative operating efficiency and favorable
financial performance achieved over the past several years, there are signs
of financial imbalance. For instance, over the 1975-1978 period it received
transEers from the Global Guarantee Fund each year in order to earn a minimum
10% return on remunerable assets. Except in 1981, it is expected to continue
to require transfers from the Fund. COPEL's annual debt service coverage
ratios (Annex 5.9) are low, expected to average 1.2 between 1978 and 1980.
The internal rate of return obtained for COPEL's investment program suggests
that the overall tariff levels may need to be raised. The problems described
above also point to possible deficiencies inherent in the existing power
sector tariff and financing policies--among them the cross-subsidization
and reversion features (para. 1.14) of the tariffs and the appropriateness of
the terms of ELETROBRAS loans (the principal source of borrowing for the
utilities).   On-going studies on sector tariffs and finances, which are being
undertaken as part of the agreements related to Loan 1300-BR are expected to
lead to recommendations on these issues.
Capital Investment Program and Financing Plan
5.05      COPEL's capital investment program and the financing plan during the
construction of the proposed subtransmission and distribution project (1980-83)

3/   In addition, COPEL will need about US$30 million of cofinancing in 1979.



- 25 -
5.06      The investment program includes the co,npletion of the Foz do Areia
hydro project being financed by: (a) a US$74 million loan from IDB, (b) loans
from ELETROBRAS and other federal financing agencies, (c) equity investments
by ELETROBRAS and the State Government, and (d) by COPEL's own internal cash
generation.
5.07      The ongoing projects also include extension of distribution lines
to serve Parana's rural population. This rural electrification program is
currently financed 60% by ELETROBRAS and 40% by the consumers. As explained
in para. 3.08, the current and projected level of investment in rural electrifi-
cation could be expanded and, therefore, COPEL is expected to formulate a
program of additional investments in rural electrification to provide services
to about 50,000 new rural customers during the project period.
5.08      The financing plan for COPEL's capital investment program during the
construction of the proposed project is reasonable. Consumer-based resources,
consisting of COPEL's internal cash generation, customer contributions in
aid of construction and reinvestment by the state and municipal governments
of their proceeds of the sole tax, will cover about 53% of COPEL's financial
needs. Borrowing, for the on-going Foz do Areia hydro project, the existing
and proposed Bank loans, ELETROBRAS loans for rural electrification and
commercial bank cofinancing are expected to cover 39% of requirements and the
remaining 8% will be covered principally by equity investments consisting of
capital subscriptions by ELETROBRAS and the State of Parana for the Foz do
Areia project.
5.09      Financial arrangements for the first power loan included a US$20
million cofinancing operation with the Bank of Nova Scotia. COPEL was able to
secure better terms for this loan than it would have obtained without Bank
participation. It is, therefore, proposed that COPEL's financing gap for
the 1979-80 period amnounting to about US$60 million 1/ be met with a similar
cofinancing operation. COPEL has received a large number of indications of
interest from commercial banks and is not expected to have any difficulty
in obtaining cofinancing on favorable terms. The contracting of the cofinanc-
ing operation would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
5.10      The financial forecasts assume the reinvestment of dividends earned
from COPEL by ELETROBRAS and the state and municipal governments during the
construction of the project. The reinvestment of these dividends and other
projected equity investments by ELETROBRAS and the State Government are
necessary to enable COPEL to maintain a satisfactory ratio between debt and
equity financing. The State Government agreed to report the provision under
Loan 1257-BR under which it undertook to reinvest in COPEL's capital stock all
dividends received through the completion of the project (or December 31, 1983,
whichever date is later). As was the case with the first power project, the
State Government agreed to provide all funds necessary to complete the project
1/   US$29.5 million and US$24.9 million in 1979 and 1980, respectively, in
June 1978 prices, plus US$5.6 million to cover price increases.



- 26 -
should COPEL's financial resources be inadequate. ELETROBRAS is expected to
continue its current practice of maintaining its 15% share of COPEL's total
capital stock through the completion of the Foz do Areia projeeL and to
reinvest all dividends received from COPEL during the period of the project
proposed for Bank financing.
5.11      As is customary with Brazilian power borrowzers, the financial projec-
tions in this chapter including the annexes are based on constant (June
1978) prices. The capital investment program as well as Bank and other loans
shown in the financial forecasts do not include price contingencies. The
reconciliation between the project cost shown in para. 4.09 and proposed Bank
loan shown in para. 5.05 is as follows:

5.12      The proposed Bank loan of US$109 million is assumed to be made to
COPEL for a term of 15 years including 3 years of grace. The financial
forecasts have been based on an annual interest rate of 7.9% for the proposed
Bank loan.
Future Financial Performance
5.13      Within the limitations described in para. 5.04, COPEL's financial
and operating performance is expected to continue to be satisfactory during
the project's execution. The entering into service of the Foz do Areia hydro
plant beginning in mid-1980 will reduce COPEL's energy purchases and reduce
its operating ratio accordingly (Annex 5.9). COPEL has projected its operating
revenues on the assumption that tariffs would be maintained in real terms at
their 1978 level; the forecasts also assume that COPEL would be allowed a
minimum 10% return on remunerable assets. As already noted, COPEL would
require transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund to achieve this objective in
every year except 1981. Its financial rate of return on revalued average net
fixed assets will not fall below 13% and its debt/equity ratio will improve
from 44/56 in 1978 to 35/65 in 1983.
5.14      Because the maturity of COPEL's existing debt is relatively short,
compared to the useful life of the related assets, COPEL's annual debt service
coverage ratio is expected to be low, when it would improve to
1.4 times, remaining at satisfactory levels thereafter. To provide the Bank
the opportunity to review COPEL's finances on a systematic basis, a series of



- 27 -
tests applicable to future investments and borrowings were agreed. With
regard to investments, COPEL would not carry out any major expansion other
than the program described in para. 4.04 without giving the Bank evidence
that such expansion is economically justified, that adequate financial
resources are available and that it conforms to the power expansion program
for the South/Southeast endorsed by ELETROBRAS. For this purpose, a major
expansion is one whose cost excees 2% of gross fixed assets in operation plus
work in progress in the case of generation and transmission projects, and 1%
in the case of distribution projects. In addition, COPEL agreed not to incur
debt with an original term of less than 8 years without the Bank's consent, if
by so doing the total outstanding principal of such debt would exceed 5% of
its total fixed assets. These two provisions are included in the existing
agreements with COPEL (Loan 1257-BR). COPEL's performance under these provi-
sions has been satisfactory. COPEL also agreed to seek the Bank's concurrence
prior to contracting any long-term borrowing during project execution if its
forecast annual debt service coverage ratios fall below the levels indicated
in Annex 5.9 (or 1.5 times, whichever is lower). To establish a mutually
agreed basis for the test, COPEL would furnish financial projections, which
would be deemed acceptable to the Bank if not specifically objected to by the
latter. COPEL has secured (principally in connection with rural electrifica-
tion) fixed-interest borrowings in Cruzeiros. The inclusion of such borrow-
ings would distort the forecast debt service coverage ratio, as they would
not be comparable to the index-linked local currency debts and borrowings
in foreign currencies making up the bulk of COPEL's indebtedness. It was,
therefore, agreed that the debt service on such debts would be excluded for
purposes of the test, subject to a maximum of 15% of total debt service.
5.15      As with the first power project, the Federal Government should agree
that should funds provided by the State of Parana be inadequate for carrying
out the project, it would make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the
provision of these funds.
Performance Indicators
5.16      Annex 5.9 contains a representative selection of indicators of
COPEL's operating and financial performance (other than those covered by
proposed covenants) through the year following project completion. Perfor-
mance as measured by these indicators would be monitored during project
execution.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      The subtransmission and JLstribution expansion program was designed
oa the basis of a load forecast covering the period 1978-1987 (para. 3.04).
However, in order to confirm long-range adequacy of the fundamental configura-
tion of the subtransmission grid, the study period was extended to 1992.
Final arrangement of this system was defined by economic comparisons of several
subtransmission schemes considering different voltage levels, substation siting,
and line routes. In all comparisons COPEL selected least-cost solutions (using
an 11% discount rate). Under the comprehensive planning performed, improve-
ments in system communications and control equipment were incorporated to
achieve higher economic system operation and reductions in reserve capacity
without impairing reliability. For the project period (1980-1983), the average
system transformer reserve capacity would be about 10%.
Return on Investment
6.02      The return on investment was estimated as the discount rate that
equates the present values of the benefits and costs associated with the
1980-1983 investment program. Benefits were measured by the forecast revenues
from the sales of electricity at the average retail level, using the tariff
in effect in December 1978, plus the sole tax. The return for the program is
about 14% which compares somewhat favorably with the opportunity cost of
capital for Brazil, estimated to be 11% (the return figure would be 12% if
program costs increase by 15%). If program costs do not increase but benefits
decrease instead by 10% or 20%, the return on investment would be 12% and 11%,
respectively. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the effect
of exchange ratesl/ different from the June 1979 (US$1 = Cr$18.0) figure
used. The results indicate that the return on investment would not be signi-
ficantly affected by the foreign exchange rate. It should be noted that on
recent similar projects in Brazil, return figures have been significantly
higher than that obtained for this investment program, thus permitting the
conclusions that tariff levels may need to be raised (para. 1.18). The tariff
study currently being carried out by DNAEE and expected to be completed by
mid-1979 should provide a more definitive basis to determine the appropriate
act*ons that would need to be taken bv sector authorities on this important
1/ Undervaluation of the Cruzeiro by 26% in 1980, 23% in 1981, 19% in 1982
and 15% in 1983 and subsequent years.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with the Federal
Government, the State Government of Parana, and COPEL on the following prin-
cipal matters.
With COPEL, to:
(a)  implement, during project execution, a program to provide electric-
ity services to at least 45,000 low-income household (para. 3.07);
(b)  prepare a program to provide electricity services to at least
50,000 new rural consumers. The program would be presented
for Bank review by November 30, 1979 and implementation
completed by June 30, 1983 (para. 3.08);
(c)  have a signed cofinancing agreement, satisfactory to the Bank
(as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan), for the
entire US$60 million (para. 5.09); and
(d)  not incur, during project execution, any long-term debt without
the Bank's concurrence if its forecast annual debt service coverage
ration falls below 1.5 (or, 1.3 in 1979, 1.2 in 1980, 1.4 in 1982
and 1983 (para. 5.14)).
With the Government of the State of Parana, to:
(e)  reinvest in the capital stock of COPEL all the dividends
received from the utility up to December 31, 1983 (para. 5.11);
and
(f)  provide, in the event of COPEL's fund insufficiency, all the
funds which may be required to carry out the project to be
financed with the proposed loan (para. 5.11);
With the Federal Government, to:
(a)  make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the provision
of funds to carry out the project, in the event that the funds
available to COPEL, included those provided by the State Govern-
ment, are insufficient for said purpose (para. 5.16).



- 30 -
7.02      The following provisions of Loan 1257-BR would be repeated under
the proposed loan:
(a) COPEL should:
(i)  maintain its earnings (including transfers from the Global
Guarantee Fund) at levels consistent with sound financial
public utility practices and in accordance with existing
legislation; to maintain its eligibility under norms
prescribed by DNAEE in the event COPEL requires transfers
from the Fund;
(ii)  not incur debt with an original term of less than 8 years
if by so doing the total outstanding principal of such debt
would exceed 5% of its total fixed assets; and
(iii)  not to carry out any major expansion without giving the
Bank evidence that such expansion is economically justified,
that adequate financial resources are available, and that it
is in accordance with plans for the Southern and Southeastern
regions endorsed by ELETROBRAS.
(b)  The Federal Government would allow COPEL to obtain a return
(together with transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund,
if required) of at least 10% on its remunerable investment.
7.03      The project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$109 million equivalent.  The loan would be repaid over a period of
15 years, including 3 years of grace.

Parana has some interest), CESP and the Adninistra-icn Nacional dA  Electricidad (ANDE), a utility in neaihbbring Paraguay.
if/  Dpr-ciation rates used in the for-ests are those contained in the guidelines issued by DNAEE.  The oaximm depreciativn rates currently allowed by DNAEE are 37
for  on- thernal plant, 4. for distribution plant and 5% fir therml plant.  As is the case with additions to fixed assets, depreciatios on assets entering into
service duins  the year are pro-rated.
k/  As di-sconed in para. 1.14 thy Bra-ilian poer tariff legislation includes a provision for revereion reserve used so co-pe-sate utilitie  whose assets are taken ever by the
gvnernent. Currently, the sesen qu-ta for the utilities is set up to a maxinum of 3% of their rever-ible fieed assets (defined as gr... fixed assets Ease extsnr
contribut ons in aid of construction)   The legislation also has a provision fur a Glohbl Guarantee reserve- a tariff equalization fund.  Fr 1981,  hen COPELRI
earnings  are espected to exceed the statutory milnimum,  the comined  reversion/Clobal Guarantee quota was calculated at the masimum  legal limit of 57 of ie reversible
ssnts (3. becin  for rever-io  and the remaining 2% for the Global Guarantee Fund). For other forecast years, the combined quota eas set at the 1978 level of 3.5.
1/   COPEL's cntribution tc the fuel consumption occount is  set by the  COI in proportion to its   rket.  For the forecast pericd COPEL's contribution to this acconct
has been assumed to grox in proportion with the mar-et gro-th.
o/  Per DNARE regalstion, beginning in 1978, tth  aceumulated depreciation  .ed in the  -           lti     f the tt cf s-ci-e i  the year end value.  This differs frs the
treatment of gexs flied assets in foonote a/ sabve.
n/   Other revenues are niecellaneous non-operating revenues conis-ting principally of penalties for late payments and charges to the telepho-e company for the use of poles
owned by COPEL.
2/ The values of the transfer frum the Glohal Guarantee Fund are those necessary to maintain the statutory mininum 10% return on re-onerable assets.
C OPEL's actual 1970 cot of service calculation (ohich is subject to approval by DNAEE) is  e.e.rally consistent with the forecast, except as noted in
Annec 3, Note 5/ and A-nee  5.2, NoEt  g/

a/ This account represents miacellaneoos  income and expenses unrelated to operations such as interest on rever-sin reserve, losses (gain) on disposal of fixed assets,
earnings on short term investments, etc. In 1980, it includes loss on flooding of the Salto Grande do Iguacu power plant.
b/ In accordance with existing legislation (Decree 1506/76) interest charged to construction has been cllculated as io0 of work in progress (pro rata tempore).
c/ COPEL is subject to the payment of income tax at the rate of 6% of net profit after deducting interest charged to construction and employee profit sharing
(with the latter estimated at about the equivalent of 1  months payroll)
d/ Elployee participation in profit sharing is estimated at the equivalent of 1$  months payroll.
i/ Beginning in 1978 dividenda are charged to income during the period they are declared rather than a year later as was the former practice. Therefore in 1978
the dividend charged to income includes about Cr$200 million declared in 1977.  Dividends are declared at the rate of 6% and 10% respectively o  paid-in common
and preference shares respectively.  As shown in Annex 5.3,          EI1TRORRAS and the state and municipal governments of Parana would reinvest moat of their
dividends in COPEL.
f/ The annual appropriation for the legal reserve is 5% of net income after participation and taxes.
L/ Audited results for 1978 are gener-lly close to the forecast, with the exception of purchased power, depreciation and receipts from the Global Guarantee
Fund, which were somewhat higher and interest expense, which was lower then forecast.  The net effect of these changes is to improve the 1978 financial
performance with respect tI that which was forecast.
