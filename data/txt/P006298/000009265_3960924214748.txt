PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT (PCR)
COMPANHIA PARANAENSE DE ENERGTA ELECTRICA (COPEL)
CQPEL SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1721-BRI
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the COPEL
Second Power Distribution Project, for which Loan 1721-BR (US$109 million)
was approved on June 7, 1979. The Borrower was Companhia Paranaense de
Energia Eletrica (COPEL), the power utility serving and belonging to the state
of Parana.
Twice (in 1982 and 1985), COPEL and the Bank amended the
description of the project, at which times its scope was substantially
enlarged. With its objectives fully achieved, the project was completed in
late 1987, about four and one-half years late as compared with the original
completion date (June 30, 1983) and about a year late as compared with the
revised completion date (June 30, 1986). At the time of the second amendment
(1985), the Bank divided the loan into two tranches to reflect new policies on
interest charges and repayments. About US$1.1 million was cancelled. The
last disbursement was on December 10, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy ane Industry Operations
Division, Country Department I (Brazil, Venezuela, and Peru), Latin America
and the Caribbean Region. COPEL prepared a final project report which was
factual and contained opinions on the performance of the Bank, suppliers, and
contractors; but not on itself or on the Government.
Preparation of the PCR was started in February 1991, following
receipt of the final project report prepared by COPEL. It is based on, inter
alia, the final project report prepared by COPEL, the Staff Appraisal Report,
the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, cupervision reports, correspondence between
the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda, and interviews with COPEL
staff in Brazil. A mission to gather information on this project returned
from Brazil in early May 1991.

COPEL SECOND POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1721-BRI
EVALUATION SUMMARY
The Project. At a cost of USS286 million (in current prices),
COPEL completed this technically low-risk transmission/distribution prcject in
1987, four and one half years late as compared with the original project com-
pletion date (June 30, 1983) and over a year late as compared with a revised
completion date (June 30, 1986). The actual project cost is comparable with
the revised project cost (USS280 million), as estimated in 1985 in connection
with the second amendment of the project description; but it is not comparable
with the appraisal estimate (US$361.7 million) because the completed project
is larger (about 47%) than the project as appraised. The lower cost for a
larger project reflected agreed increases in the scope of the project together
with substantial reductions of the unit prices for many items.
In 1982, COPEL and the Bank agreed to amend the project des-
cription to include the transmission/distribution program of a company which
COPEL had just acquired. Subsequently, COPEL also obtained Bank agreement to
disburse proceeds from Loan 1721-BR for works which were not part of the pro-
ject description but which were compatible with the objectives of the loan.
Underlying the financing of these additions were savings on the loan due to
substantial reductions in the unit price of equipment. There were also many
changes to the project reflecting a slower-than-expected growth rate of
demand. In 1985, as there still were savings on the loan, the Bank and COPEL
agreed to amend the project description a second time to incorporate all of
the additions since the first amendment plus new additions. In this fashion,
the scope of the project was greatly increased.
Performance. COPEL executed the project efficiently. By
redefining this project as a time-slice of a larger expansion program rather
than as a precisely defined list of works, the Bank responded in an innovative
manner to the realities confronting COPEL. This innovative approach has been
incorporated into Bank procedures.
In contrast to these cooperative efforts, the Government-Bank
dialogue on the level of tariffs and other financial policies led to financial
recovery programs (in 1981, 1983, and 1986) which were not fully implemented.
These recovery programs reflected the underlying attitude of understanding on
the part of the Bank toward the difficulties of Brazil. Because it relied on
the good faith of the Government to implement these programs, the Bank
continued tt disburse existing power loans and to make new loans. However,
the Governmern gave priority to short-term anti-inflationary and political



- iii -
During 1987-1989, the Bank and the Government tried to reach
agreement on a sector adjustment loan, but these efforts failed because of the
choice of other strategic objectives -- again, anti-inflationary and political
-- on the part of the Government.
Lessons to be Learned.   There are two lessons to be learned,
one related to the project and the other related to Bank-country relations.
(i)  ProEict.  The redefin.tion by the Bank of the project as a time-slice of
a larger expansion program provided COPEL with flexibility appropriate to its
changing market and regulatory/financial circumstances. This approach
replaced the earlier approach which defined transmission/ distribution
projects as a list of works subject to no or little change after loan
approval. This was an innovative adaptation on the part of the Bank; and has
been incorporated into Bank procedures.
(Li) BAnkfqCountrv Relations. On the larger level of policy and Bank-country
relations, _.ne lesson to be learned from the Bank-Government dialogue on
sector finances during the period 1981-1989 is that lending in circumtances of
continuing financial deterioration sends the Government the wrong message; and
that enforcement of agreed conditions sends the Government the right message.
In 1990, the Bank conditioned effectiveness of a newly approved investment
loan benefitting electric utilities to the implementation of an agreed sector-
tside tariff level. To date, because the Government has been unwilling to
implement the agreed tariff level, the loan agreeement remains unsigned. Even
if the Government chooses not to observe its agreements, the Bank, by
enforcing such agreements, establishes its credibility.

2. Backaround
2.01 Bank Lending to the Sector and to COPEL. Since 1949, the Bank has made 42
loans totalling almost USS4.0 billion to benefit the electric power sector,
including four loans (Part III, Table 1) to benefit Companhia Paranaenue de
Energia Eletrica (COPEL) -- the electric power utility which belongs to and
serves the state of Parana. The first loan was to an electric utility absorbed
by COPEL. The second and third loans were to COPEL. The third loan, 1721-BR,
helped to financed the COPEL Second Power Distribution Project, which is the
subject of this report.   The holding company for Federal power companies,
Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, SA (ELETROBRAS) was the borrower of the fourth
loan benefitting COPEL (Loan 2365-BR, US$222.8 million, 1983).   ELETROBRAS
reloaned about US$104.5 million to COPEL to help finance a rural electrification
program. This loan closed on June 30, 1990.
2.02        Through the mid 1970s, the bulk of Bank lending helped to finance
hydroelectric stations and transmission works in the Southern and Southeastern
regions.  From the mid 1970o to 1985, the emphasis shLfted to financing the
expansion of transmission and distribution systems nationwide. In 1986, a sector
adjustment loan aimed at encouraging financial rehabilitation, conservation, and
environmental/social safeguards.   The Bank approv'ed a loan (3227-BR; US$385
million) in June 1990 for an electricity transmission and conservation proj(ct;
but the loan remains unsigned.
2.03 Organization. The sector consists of a relatively compact group of state
and Federally-owned utilities with primary responsibilities for, respectively,
distribution and generation/transmission. Although the authority of the Federal
Government to supervise sector financial decision-making, especially with respect
to levels for tariffs, borrowing and investment expenditure, is paramount, its
exercise of such authority in recent years has reflected the impact of political



2
and short-term anti-inflationary considerations; and has resulted in the
deteriorated financial performance of the electric power sector. Complicating
the financial problems of the sector are unresolved insues of the Federal-state
relationship. For example, to solve their financing problems, state companies
hav-, with increasing frequency, withheld payment to the Federal companies which
*ell bulk power for distribution by the state companies and withheld payment to
the RENCOR, which distributes excess operating income (above 12% on remunerable
asets) from the financially stronger companies to the weaker ones. In 1990, the
Bank and the Government agreed on a sector-wide tariff level as a condition of
effectiveness for Loan 3227-BR; however, since Bank approval, the Government has
made no progress toward compliance with this condition and the loan remains
unsigned.
2.04        In 1978, when the project was appraised, the Government supervised
the sector through two agencies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry cf Mines
and Energy: Departamento Nacional de Aquas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE), a
regulatory body which approved, later alia, tariff levels and expansion plans;
and ELETROBRAS, a holding copany for Federally-owned power companies with sector-
wide planning and financial functions. In 1981, in connection with its larger
macroeconomic strategy, the Government required the final approval of the
planning agency, the Secretaria de Controle de Empresas Estatais/ Secretaria de
Planejamento (SEST/SEPLAN), for tariff increasee and for levels of investment
expenditures by state- and Federally-owned enterprises, including power
utilities. These three agencies -- DNAEE, ELETROBRAS, and SEST/SEPLAN
-- established the regulatc y environment in which the project was carrie4 out
during the years 1980-1987.
2.05  Develo2mpnt Obiectives.   In order to reduce dependence on  imported
petroleum and to improve the netional balance-of-payments situation, the
Government, following the oil crisis (1974), adopted a national energy policy
which emphasized maximum exploitation of: (i) local primary energy sources,
especially hydro; and (ii) the economic benefits resulting from interconnecting
and coordinating the operation of generation and transmission facilities. The
Government also sought to extend electric power nupply to areas with little or
inadequate service.
2.06        To achieve consistency with these sector development objectives, Bank
lending, beginning in the mid 1970s, began to emphasize the financing of trans-
mission and distribution works. Through Loan 1343-BR (1977: US$82 million), the
Bank helped the Federal generating company ior the Southeastern reg^on (Centrais
Eletricas do Sul, S.A. -- ELETROSUL) to interconnect its transmission system with
that of the Federal generating company of the Southern region (Furnns Centrais
Eletricas, S.A.); and through Loan 1895-BR (1980: US$125 million), the Bank
helped ELETROSUL to reinforce and expand its transmission system. Through the
second and third loans benefitting COPEL (see para. 1), the Bank helped COPEL
expand and reinforce its subtransmission and distribution systems.
2.07        in 1978, the Country Program Paper for Brazil proposed that the Bank
support Government sector objectives by: (a) providing a portion of the large
financial requirements of the sector; (b) acting as a catalyst for the mobiliza-
tion of long-term funds from other external financing agencies; (c) promoting
rational tariff policies enabling sufficient self-financing for the sector; and



3
(d) helping to strengthen the management and planning of power utilities. As
COPEL was a well managed company, Bank support for the project was primarily to
achieve the first three of the aoove objectives.
3. Descriotion and Obiectives.
3.01        Consisting mainly of eubtransmission and distribution works, the
project war part of the COPEL construction program for the period January 1, 1980
to June 30, 1983. This program included completion of the hydroelectric plant
at Foz do Areia (1674 MW) whichn was part of the least-cost regional expansion
plan (1975-1990) prepared by ELETROBRAS. The project also included auxiliary
facilities in the form of equipment for the COPEL electrical/chemical laboratory
and consultant services to prepare bidding documents and to inspect equipment
farbrication.
3.02        The main objective of the project -- and its underlying central
concept -- was the reliable supply of electricity services to meet growing market
demand with expanded subtransmission and distribution facilities selected on
least-cost criteria and utilizing traditional design criteria. COPEL covenanted
to provide service connections for low-income urban customers and rural cus-
tomers, although these facilities were not part of the project description. Bank
pai.'ticipation was also expected to facilitate foreign commercial financing
through co-financing arrangements.
4. Prenaration and Implementation.
4. 01  Preparation Bank staff executed preparation/appraisal efficiently in June-
November 1978; and successfully investigated such subjects as the works to be
executed, plus their timetable, cost, financing, market, and economic
justification. Staff were also successful in their efforts to include in the
loan agreement covenants to ensure the implementation of distribution works to
benefit low-income customers and rural customers. The Board of Director approved
the loan on June 7, 1979; the loan agreement, which was signed on June 20, 1979,
became effective on November 21, 1979 (Part SII, Table 2).
4.02  Implementation: Completion Date, Changes and Cost. In December 1987, COPEL
completed an enlarged project, which reflected many changes, at a cost of US$286
million (Ln current prices). The actual completion date was four and one-half
years late as compared with the appraisal estimate (June 30, 1983), but only a
year late as compared the with the completion date (December 1986) expected in
connection with the second amendment of the project description. Twice (1982 and
1985), COPEL obtained Bank agreement to amend the project description by enlarg-
ing its scope. Both before and after the second amendment, COPEL also persuaded
the Bank to finance with proceeds of the loan certain works which were compatible
with the objectives of the project but which were not part of the original or
amended project descriptions.  As measured by the percentage increase of the
various project sub-categories weighted by their contribution to the appraisal
cost estimate (excluding price contingencies), the completed project was 47%
larger than that expected at appraisal and 19% larger than the project as amended
in 1985. The final project cost of US$286 million was about 2% greater than the
1985 cost estimate, US$280 million (in current prices).  The appraisal cost
estimate was USS361.7 million (in current prices), but given the substantial



4
enlargement and other changus to the project, the actual cost is not corparable
with the appraisal estimate. Actual Bank financing amounted to US$107.9 million;
COPEL furnished the balance.
4.03        An early as 1981, before agreement on the first amendment to the
project description, implementation was about a year behind schedule. This delay
was primarily due to the fact that COPEL management in 1979, which was new and
inexperienced with the Bank, had deferred starting procurement action until after
the loan became effective (November 21, 1979). Also in 1981, COPEL, anticipating
a reduced project cost (US$338 millions) with savings on the loan (US$24 million)
because of lower-than-expected equipment costs, sought to apply those savings to
the purchase of spare parts, etc. The Bank did not agree, as the equipment would
have been used for non-project purposes.
4.04        In 1982,  COPEL obtained  Bank agreement to amend the project
description by adding the subtransmission/distribution expansion program of a
small power company acquired by COPEL -- Cia. Hidroeletrica Paranapanema (CHEP).
This increase in scope was expected to cost about USS30 million; and involvse . o
change in project completion date (June 30, 1983).
4.05        Cost reductions (and therefore savings on the loan) continued to
materialize in 1983 and the following year due to the fact that: (1) price
escalation on Brazilian contracts was lower than the rate of excnange variation,
resulting in lower equivalent costs stated in US dollars; (2) actual price
escalation rates for imported goods were lower than the ones utilized during
appraisal; and (3) competition among Brazilian suppliers and contractors resulted
in lower prices than had been expected at appraisal. About 70.5% of the proceeds
of the loan were disbursed for conductors, meters, and power and distributiun
transformers, all but one of which items experienced substantial unit price
reductions, as shown below:

Later, in connection with the second amendment, the deletion/deferral of certain
sub-transmission works (para. 4.09) due to market changes also contributed to the
size of the savings.



S
4.06        Besides delaying project start-up (para. 4.03), COPEL carried out the
project at a slower-than-expected rate because demand grow more slowly than
expected over the rariod 1979-1983 (8. 6% p. a. vs. 14. 1% p. a.)  Over the next two
years (1984 and 1985), the actual rate of demand growth (13.% p.a.) exceeded the
forecast rate (1.3% p.a.); but the actual level of sales in 1985 (8,035 GWh)
remained 19.3% below the forecast level (10,285 GWh).  When the project was
completed in 1987, actual sale. in that year (8,499 GWh) had not rcrehed the
level projected for 1985 (10,285 GWn).  The lower rate of demand growth was
primarily due to the delay and/or cancellation of two major industrial projects
and the unanticipated decline of the state's rural population (see para. 5.08).
4.07           As a response to lower demand growth, COPEL also introduced, with
Bank agreement, many changes to the project -- substitutions, cancellations/
postponements, and additions. For example, in circumstances of lower demand,
COPEL found that 69 kV facilities reinsulated to operate at 138kV constituted an
excellent substitute for 230 kV facilities which, being unneeded, were cancelled
or postponed.
4.08          In 1984, COPEL, with Bank agreement, applied savings on the loan
to purchase additional transmission equipment which was compatible with the
purposes of the loan. The transformer capacity at SSs Pilarzinho and Gov. Paro-
got de Souz& @ 230 kV were examples of such additions.   Anticipating a
substantial unused balance on the loan, COPEL proposed a second amendment to the
project description which would again increase the scope of the project. The new
project description would incorporate all the additions and changes agreed since
the first amendment plus new changes and additions -- namely a two-year time
slice (1985-1986) of the COPEL subtransmission/ distribution program.
4.09        In 1985, the Bank agreed to the new amendment of the project
description. Besides being 26% larger than the project as appraised (based on
the percentage increases of the sub-categories weighted by their respective con-
tributions to the appraisal cost estimate), the project as amended for the second
time included the addition (and deletion) of works to take into account the
slower growth rate and different geographic pattern of growth.  With a new
completion date of December 30, 1986, the newly amended project was expected to
cost USS280 million.  As for the project as amended the first time, the Bank
estimated that as of June 1985: (i) execution of that project (incluc  ng the
changes agreed in 1984) was 95% complete and 18 months behind schedule; (ii)
expenditures on these works amounted to about US$205 million as compared with the
appraisal estimate of US$362 mtllion; and (iii) the unused balance of the loan
would amount to US$22.3 million.
4.10        In connection with the second amendment, the Bank did not follow its
normal policy of cancelling loan savings. This change meant explicit recognition
that distribution projects, unlike unitary civil-works projects, are continuous,
changing, multi-year activities; and that because distribution projects are not
defined, like unitary civil works, by precise amounts of material, they should
not be subjected to the savings-cancellation policy applied to loans financing
civil-works. Also contributing to Bank thinking was the recognition that in 1985
the sector urgently needed resources and that meeting that need thrcagh savings
on an existing loan was more cost effective than processing a new loan.

4.14  Connectione to Low-Income Urban Customers and Rural Customers.  COPEL
fulfilled its covenanted obligations to complete by June 30, 1983 progame of
service connections to 45,000 low-income urban customers and 50,000 rural
customers (LA, Sections 3.06 and 3.07).  Through 1983, COPEL supplied service to
approximately 54,000 new customers who whould qualify as the urban poor and
almost 59,000 new rural customers.
4.15 Closino Dates.  Because slow market growth led to delays and changes in the
project, COPEL sought and obtained Bank agreement to extensions of the closing
date.  The original closing date of June 30, 1983 was extended to June 30, 1985.
In connection with the second amendment of the project description (June 22,
1985), the Bank and COPEL agreed on a new closing date, Jane 30, 1986. This was
later extended to June 30, 1987.
4.16  Tranchino. Allocation of Proceeds and Disbursment Schedule.  At the time
of the second amendment, the Bank split the loan into two tranches: US$86.7
million and US$22.3 million. This action was consistent with two new policies:
(i) substituting a variable interest rate to reflect the changes in the borrowing
costs of the Bank for a fixed rate, and (ii) repaying the amounts borrowed on a
"currency-pooling"' approach to spread the rate-of-exchange risk fairly among all
borrowers.   The first tranche would continue to be repaid in the currencies
disbursed and under the conditions originally negotiated: a term of 15 years,
including three years of grace, at a fixed interest rate of 7.9%. The term of
the second tranche remained unchanged, but the interest rate would be the Bank's
variable rate and the currencies would be repaid to reflect the "currency
pooling" approach.
4.17        Actual and forecast allocations of the loan were close; but the
actual and forecast timing of disburesmente were very different.   Actual
disbursements lagged expected disbursements by four and one-half years. A total
of about US$1 million was cancelled from the two tranches because they were not
utilized within the prescribed period (Part III, Tables 5 and 6).
5. Financial Performance
5.01 Background. The legal structure of the sector is such that, in order to
understand the financial performance of the individual power company, it is
necessary to analyze the performance of the sector. Sector finances and deci-
sions on levels for taziffe, borrowing, and investment expenditure reflect the
paramount regulatory authority of the Government; and the same is true for com-
pany finances.  Also impacting on sector and company finances, but of lesser
importance, are economic conditions (local and national) and the skills of
management.
Sector Financial Performance
5.02  Tariff Levels.   After 1978,  sector finances deteriorated because the
Government, mainly due to political considerations, allowed tariff levels to
decline in real terms (Part III, Table 7). The financial difficulties of the
power sector were exacerbated by greater reliance on borrowings and a heavy debt-
service burden (Part III, Table 8). By late 1981, due to low tariff levels, the



9
sector rate of return had declined below the legal minimum of 10% established by
law, and moat of the power borrowers of the Bank were unable to comply with their
respective revenue covenants which were based on Brazilian power-tariff
legislation.
5.03 In their initial effort (September 1981) to address the financial problems
of the power sector, the Government and the Bank agreed on a tariff recovery plan
featuring *real" tariff increases of 3% in 1982 and of 5% annually thereafter
until the sector earned a return of 10% on remunerable assets. The Bank con-
firmed this agreement by its letter to the Government of December 23, 1981. The
letter also provided that the Bank would not enforce the covenants of previous
loans relating to rate of remuneration as long as the Government and the sector
complied with the plan for financial recovery.
5.04 In 1982, because the Government implemented tariff increases at a slower
rate than needed to raise the "real" level as called for under the plan, the
level of the average tariff in "real" terms was about 10% below the level of
1981; and the sector did not cover its debt service (Part III, Table 8). The
plan failed to achieve its objective because political considerations dominated
the thinking of the Government. Also contributing to this result were defects
inherent in the plan, implementation delays, and high levels of inflation.
5.05   In 1983, the Government and the Bank amended the 1981 plan to reflect new
financial targets and a new timetable for financial recovery; and when the sector
again did not meet the new targets, the Government and the Bank agreed in 1986
on a third plan of financial recovery (Power Sector Recovery Plan -- PSRP) which
the Bank supported with Loan 2720-BR (USS500 million). The PSRP was part of a
larger plan for macreconomic stabilization, the "Cruzado" Plan, which featured
price controls, including a freeze on electricity prices. In August 1987, the
Bank and the Government discontinued their efforts to negotiate a second sector
adjustment loan due to the re-introduction of price controls, including a freeze
on electricity tariffs. The Bank and the Government renewed their efforts to
negotiate a second sector adjustment loan in 1988 and in 1989 but these efforts
failed due to the choice by the Government of other strategic objectives and
deteriorating economic conditions. A full discussion of the expectations and
results for Loan 2720-BR appears in its PCR (prepared by the Brazil Department,
LAC Region I and dated December 6, 1989).
5.06     During the years  1981-1986,  the Bank,  noting the difficulty  and
complexity of the macroeconomic and political problems of Brazil, felt that it
would be more useful to help the Brazilians to formulate and implement a credible
plan of tariff and financial recovery than to terminate the dialogue by suspend-
ing disbursements or by stopping the processing of new loans. Accordingly, the
Bank, relying on the recovery plans agreed with the Government in 1981, 1983, and
1986 continued to make investment loans (2138-BR, 2364-5-BR, etc.) and a sector
adjustment loan (2720-BR); and subsequently tried to process additional sector
loans in 1987-89. Notwithstanding their disappointing results, the plans and the
subsequent loan-processing efforts provided a useful vehicle for dialogue with
the Government. It is likely that they helped to prevent worse financial deteri-
oration, although this cannot be proven.

5.07  Sales & Economic Conditions.   During the years 1979-1983 (and later), the
economy of Parana did not grow as rapidly as anticipated when the project was
appraised  (1978).   In addition to operating in a difficult macroeconomic
situation, the local economy reflected the impact of deferred or cancelled
industrual projects and a profound change in agricultural production techniques.
As a result of these factors, during the years 1979-1983, COPEL sales grew at a
much slower rate than expected, 8.6% p.a. vs. 14.1% p.a. (para. 4.06).
5.08   Sales to industrial customers are the largest category of total sales
(about 47%) sales; and according to COPEL, the delay and/or cancellation of two
major industrial projects were the most important factors accounting for the
shortfall in total sales. Due to easier supply conditions in world oil markets,
PETROBRAS cancelled its NSchist Program"; and a project in the paper industry,
which used only half the load originally expected, was completed two years late.
Sales to other categories of urban consumers (residential, commercial, and
government) grew less than expected because the urban population grew less than
expected (actual net increases of only 40.9% vs. expected net increases of
53.4%). Fewer people moved to the cities because there was a large, unantici-
pated decline (18% between 1978 and 1987) in the rural population. The decline
was due to the migration of rural labor to neighboring states because of the: (i)
displacement of coffee, corn, and beans, which is cultivated with labor-intensive
methods, by wheat and soybeans, which is cultivated with efficient labor-dispens-
ing machines.   Also facilitating the movement of the rural population to
neighboring states, especially Matto Grosso do Sul, were various incentives
(subsidies and tax breaks) offered by the Federal Government.   The factors
underlying these changes could not be reasonably foreseen.
5.09  Technical Performance Indicators.   COPEL management is competent and
operates one of the more efficient utilities in Brazil. Except in 1984, COPEL
consistently reduced the actual ratio for energy losses below the annual targets
(about 10%) established at appraisal. Further, while sales levels in 1987 (8,499
GWh) were about four years behind schedule, the customer/employee ratio (175) was
only about a year behind schedule. These were outstanding achievements, which
were reflected in the financial performance of COPEL.   Part III, Table 9.0
compares actual and forecast technical indicators.
5.10 Finances. During the period 1980-1983, as shown in the schedule on the
following page, due to low tariff levels (paras. 5.03 -.06) and advorse market
developments (para. 5.08) -- factors outside the control of the borrower --
actual summarized levels of sales, average tariffs, revenues, and net internal
cash generation, etc., including investment expenditures, were below forecast
levels.   Shortfalls with respect to net internal cash generation (Cr51,925
million), borrowing (CrS258 million) and equity contributions (Cr$392 million)
were offset by lower financing requirements (Cr$2757 million), including a
shortfall of investment expenditure (CrS3789 million) which was partialy offset
by an increase in other applications (Cr51214 million). The corresponding ratios
of financial performance for this period were: debt-service coverage (1   X),
self-financing (18.3%), operating (69.8%), and returns on remunerabl'    sets
(5.4%-7%), long-term debt as a percent of equity plus long-term debt (5: 53%),
and accounts receivable outstanding (64-52 days).   As measured by these key



11
ratios, the performance of COPEL, while below what was expected in most cases,
remains quite acceptable.  The same is true with respect to the performance of
COPEL for the years 1984 and 1985.   During the remaining years of project
implementation, 1986 and 1987, the performance of COPEL, while surpassing that
of the sector, deteriorated as compared with its earlier performance, especially
with respect to coverage of debt service and self financing.    Part III, T&bles
9.1-.4   set  forth actual and forecast  financial data for COPEL -- income
statements, sources and applications of funds, etc

5.11        COPEL did not earn the rate of return on remunerable assets (10%)
expected at appraisal and convenated in the Loan Agreement. However, since the
revenue covenants of loan agreements for power projects in Brazil had been
succeeded by a series of sector financial recovery plans, the Bank considered
these low returns to be acceptable, as long as the financial performance of the
sector conformed to the targets and timetables of gradual recovery set forth in
the different plans (para. 5.03).
Proiect Results.
6.01 Obiectives. Completion and energization of the various works -- ST1.s, SSs,
circuits, etc. -- marked achievement of the fundamental objective of the project:
reinforcing the reliability and flexibility of the COPEL system. This objective
was consistent with the development objectives of the Government which emphasized
maximum exploitation of local primary energy sources and the economic benefits
resulting from interconnecting and coordinating the operation of generation and
transmission facilities (para. 2.05). As for the objectives of the Bank, the
loan provided a portion of the financial requirements of the sector. The results
of this loan (and other loans benefitting the power sector) fell well short of
the desired objectives of promoting rational tariff and self-financing policies
(paras. 5.02-.06; Part III, Schedules 7 & 8).  The loan did not serve as a
catalyst for mobilizing long-term funds from other financing agencies; but this
was not a constraint for COPEL.
6.02 Return on Investment. At appraisal, the rate of return on the regional
investment program for 1980-1983 was estimated at 11%. The actual rate of return
was 6%, which is low -- reflecting the impact of the Government's tariff policy.
The actual rate of return is based on: (i) actual investment expenditures for the
period 1980-1987, actual operating costs for the period 1980-1989, and expected
operating costs which are based on operating costs in 1989s and (ii) actual and
expected benefits. Actual benefits are based on actual retail revenues for
1982-90 times (x) actual sales for 1982-90 associated with the expansion program.
Benefits for 1991 and later years are based on expected sales for the correspond-
ing years times actual retail tariffs as of January 1991 (and maintained in
subsequent years). If the Government were to raise tariff levels in line with
recent Bank-Government agreements, the internal rate of return on investment
would be 9% (Part III, Table 11).
7.0 Performance of the COPEL. the Bank. and the Government.
7.01 COPEL responded rationally and flexibly to its changing circumstances,
market and financial (paras. 4.04, 4.06, and 4.09). The changes to the project
were appropriate. COPEL was satisfied with the performance of its suppliers and
contractors. The financial performance of COPEL primarily reflected the impact
of decisions taken by the Government. It complied with the major covenants of the
Loan Agreement (Part ISI, Schedule 12). COPEL expressed no dissatisfaction with
the performance of its suppliers and contractors.
7002   The level and extent of Bank supervision was appropriate  (Part III,
Schedule 13), as the Borrower was technically competent. The redefiniton of the
project as a time-slice of the multi-year expansion program was innovative and
appropriate (para. 4.10).



13
7.03 The involvement of the Bank with COPEL took place in the wider context of
its continuing dialogue with the Government on restoring sector finance& (paras.
7.03-.09).   Between 1981 and 1986, the Bank, taking account of the complex
economic, financial, and political problems of Brazil, made a series of invest-
ment loans and one sector adjustment loan based on the underfAtanding that the
Government would implement three credible plans negotiated in 1981, 1983, and
1986 for rehabilitating the finances of the sector. The plans failed to achieve
their objective because the Government, due to political considerations plus
other factors, did not support the sector with adequate tariff levels. Between
1987 and 1989, despite strenuous efforts, the Bank and the Government were unable
to agree on terms for new lending due to tariff, macroeconomic, and other
conditions. In such circumstances, there was very little that the Bank could do
to influence pol,cy.
8. Lesoons to be Learned.
8.01 COPEL performed well in executing this technically low-risk project which
required many changes; and the Bank responded flexibily and in an innovative
manner by re-defining the project as a time-slice of a continuing, multi-year
transmission/distribution expansion program rather than as a precisely defined
list of works. This new approach has been incorporated into Bank proedures and
characterizes the handling of transmission/distribution projects.
8.02   As for the financial regulation of the sector by the Government, the
comments of an earlier PC'i on a trasmission project (ELETROSUL Second Power
Transmisson) financed by Loan 1895-BR are relevant: " On the larger issue of the
financial deterioration of the sector and the role of the Bank, it seems clear
that lending in circumstances of continuing financial deterioration sends the
borrower the wrong message and leads to a significant risk that agreements for
financial  rehabilitation will  not be observed.    Between  1987-89,  due to
marcoeconomic, tariff, and other issues, the Bank and the Government did not
agree on the terms for new loans to the power sector.  In June 1990, after the
Government implemented major tariff increases, the Executive Directors of the
Bank approved a new loan to support a power transmission and conservation
project.   Effectiveness and continued disbursement will be conditioned on
achieving and maintaining an even higher tariff. This appears to be the right
way to maintain the dialogue."

PART II: PROJECT REVIF  FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
(Note: The commentary on the performance of the Bank -- Part A -- was excerpted
from portions of the final project report prepared by COPEL. The commentary on
the performance of the Government -- Part B -- was communicated by fax.)
A. Role of the Bank.
IBRD is a fundamental development agent and financing source for COPEL, and
its participation has represented a significant improvement in several areas,
besides guaranteeing medium and long-term financing support, allowing for a
rational and optimized planning of the electric system execution. As for Loan
1721-BR specifically, various benefit.s accrued from the relationship, as.. .will
be detailed below:
" 1.0 Social Benefits
A total population of 2.7 million was reached by the project financed thorugh
Loan 1721-BR ......"
'" 2.0 System Improvements
The project promoted meaningful improvements in several aspects of (the) COPEL
electric system. Energy losses... (were] reduced signficantly, falling from 13%
in 1978 to 8% in 1987.    Stability of the transmission  system was  also
improved... In terms of reliability, indeces (of outages] fell considerably
through the period 1979 to 1987..."
0 3.0 Technological Improvements
The community as a whole was benefited from the project.. .through a reinforcement
of the technological cooperation among COPEL, Universidade Federal do Parana and
the state's productive sectors, which was brought about by the enlargement of our
Central Laboratory of Eletrotechnics and Electronics..."
"4.0 Cost Reduction
As for ICB processes, they proved very beneficial.. .Proposing more competitive
prices, small and medium size local contractors were successful in the majority
of tenderings for works at substations and transmission lines....A  a negative
aspect, owing to the variations verified in the world economy, som times the use
of the exchange rate of the bid opening date did not reflect that actual cost....
Such deviations occured only as for bids submitted in currencies whose values
rose in relation to the the US dollar."
"5.0 Bank's Participation in System ExDansion
"An analysis of the physical execution of COPEL's electric system during the per-
iod 1980 to 1987 shows that around 30% was executed with Bank financing. The
table... (on the next page] compares the total execution to what was effectively
financed by IBRD in the period through Loans 1721-BR and partially through Loan

2. Role of the Government.  Concerning tariff levels in 1991, COPEL stated that
the Government has not abandoned the goal of restoring sector finances.   "We
would only like to comment that, as far as the Government's performance is
concerned, we must also emphasize that, for the last years, efforts have been
made to increase (the) sector tariff level, as evidenced by the measures taken
under the Economic Stabilization Plans of March 1990 and February 1991."

Table 3: Actual, Amended, and Forecast Proiect Works
Page 1 of 8
1.                        The attached bchedules compare actual, amended, and
forecast project works, including completion dates. Works are identified on
these schedules by certain initials in the "Works" column, which indicate what
was added to the project. For example, "SAR" indicates the works listed in
Annex 4.2 of the Staff Appraisal Report (dated May 3, 1979, No. 2411b-BR) --
69 substation works @ 69 to 230 kV, 39 substation works @ 34.5 kV and 26
tranamission line works to be executed in 1980-1983.
2.                        The other initials are "CHEP", "I", "I - 06/84",
"P.E", and "N". "CHEP" indicates the works added to the project in June 1982
following the acquisition by COPEL of another power utility. These works
included 4 substation works at 69 kV and 138 kV, 13 substation works @ 34.5 kV
and 6 tranmission line works. "I" corresponds to 13 substation works @ 69 kV
and 230 kV, 62 substation works at 34.5 kV and 18 transmission line works
executed in 1980-1983. "I - 06/84" corresponds to 6 substation works @ 69 to
230 kV and 12 transmission line works @ 69 kV and 138 kV, which were financed
with proceeds of Loan 1721-BR after discussions with the Bank mission visiting
COPEL in June 1984. "P.E." stands for "Project Extension" and refers to the
57 substation works @ 69 kV to 230 kV, 59 substation works @ 34.5 kV and 15
transmission line works to be executed in 1985-1986. These works were added
to the project description in 1985. "N" stands for "New Works" and refers to
5 substation works at 230 kV and 9 transmission line works at 69 kV and 138
kV, which were not included in "P.E.", but which were gradually included the
works financed under the loan because they were compatible with the objectives
of the project.
3.                         Pages 5-8 of this table set forth reasons for the
deletions and/or postponement of the individual works.

Table 3. (Continued)

2. Reproduced below are the details for cancellations and postponements of
the various works, as taken from the final project report prepared by COPEL:
As it was indicated in the previous table, subsequently we present
the justifications for the works which have been cancelled or
postponed to later than 1987.
As for the works considered in the SAR, CHEP and PE and that, for
various reasons, had their executions delayed but were concluded
until December, l997, as well as the works which were altered in
relation to forecast and executed services, no justifications are
presented as they involve long explanations with planning, supply
and executive details.
a.  PARANA'S COAST SYSTEM
The extension plan  (1978  through  1987)  presupposed  the
reinforcement of the system which already existed on the
Coast of Parana, through the superposition of a system at
230 kV, derived from the 230 kV TL "Governador Parigot de
Souza" - from Uberaba to Paranagua and the construction of
the Substation "Posto Fiscal", with transformation 230/69
kV and its connection to the lines at 69 kV.
Further restudies have demonstrated the feasibility of
reinsulating part of the existing 69 kV system to operate
at  138  kV  and  postponing,  for  a  long   period,   the
superposition of 230 kV.
Due to the considerable economic advantages, this solution
was adopted and its implementation was concluded in 1987
with the construction of the second transmission line at
138 kV "Governador Parigot de Souza" - Paranagua.
The works cancelled or included owing to this solution are
indicated in the table named "Physical Implementation of
Works".
b.  SUBSTATION "ALMIRANTE TAMANDARE" - CONSTRUCTION
owing to a smaller charge growth in relation to what had
been foreseen for the region, the construction of the
substation, to be fed by TL "CCO - Rio Branco do Sul", was
cancelled and later substituted for a 34.5 kV substation to
be constructed in 1988.
c. SUBSTATION vBACACHERI AND BARIGUI'" - Extension
These works corresponded to the installation of the second
power transformer to reinforce the supply and improve
service reliability.



- 23 -                Table 3
Page 6 of 8
Because of a smaller charge growth and changes in the
distribution  network  planning,  these   works   will   be
necessary only by 2989 and 1988 respectively.
d. SUBSTATION "CENTRO" - EXTENSION
Work cancelled owing to changes in the distribution network
planning, so as to avoid charge concentration at this
substation.
e. SUBSTATION "ISANTA QUITERIA" - EXTENSION
Works related to the construction of a new output for TL at
69 kV, postponed to 1988 due to technical difficulties at
execution.
In 1988, a complete reform in the 69 kV bars will be
executed.
f. SUBSTATION "QUATRO BARRAS- - CONSTRUCTION
work being executed and expected to be concluded in 08/88.
It was postponed for about 20 months due to a smaller
charge growth in the region.
g.  TL "ATUBA - BACACHERI" - 69 kV
Substation  "Atuba'  was  expected   to   feed   Substation
"Bacacheri".Because of changes verified in the planning of
the  system  and  in   the   construction   of   substation
"Pilarzinho" 230/69 kV, that work was substituted for TL
"Pilarzinho - Bacacheri'.
h. THE MIDDLE IGUACU SYSTEM
In the Extension Plan 1978 to 1987, it was foreseen the
reinforcement of the existing system of 69 kV in the Middle
Iguacu River, constituted by the interconnection of Foz do
Areia, Socorro, Guarapuava, Irati, Rio Azul and Uniao da
Vitoria, through the superposition of a system at 230 kV.
The construction of the TL 'Areia-Guarapuava' at 230 kV and
of   the   substation   "Guarapuava"   with    230/69    kV
transformation    was    envisaged.    Further    restudies
demonstrated that the reinsulation of the system from 69 to
138 kV would  be  much  more  economical  for  serving  the
region.
This solution was adopted and its implementation will be
concluded by 1990. Since 1985, the interconnection between
Ponta Grossa and Guarapuava has been operating at 138 kV.
i.  TL "CPSTRO - PIRAI DO SUL" - 138 kV
Work cancelled because of a smaller charge growth and the
doubling of the 34.5 kV system serving the region.

Page 7 of 8
j. TL "IVAIPORA - PITANGA" - 138 kV
Works postponed to 1989 due to a smaller growth of  charges
in the region.
k.  TL "CAMPO MOURAO" 230 kV - EXTENSION
Work being executed, assumed to be concluded by 05/88. The
delay in the execution was due to problems with a 230/138
kV - 150 MVA transformer during delivery from the port to
the substation.
1.  WESTERN PARANA SYSTEM
The expansion of the Western Parana System, formed by the
interconnections Cascavel, Pinheiros, Guaira, Palotina,
Assis Chateaubriand, Ipora, Altonia and Umuarama, was
planned   to   have   the   substations  "Cascavel"  230kV,
"Palotina" 230kV, "Umuarama" 230 kV and 'Foz do Iguacu"
230kV as power injection points and to have Ilha Grande
Plant interconnected only with Itaipu's 750 kV System.    A
further appraisal of this Plant pointed out the advantages
of using it as an energy source for the region and
integrating it to the system 500 to 230 kV.
Counting   on  this  source,  besides  the  possibility  of
reinsulating the existing 69 kV system to 138 kV, a new
alternative for serving the region was considered.
Such an alternative proved to be much more economical than
the one previously proposed and consisted of:
*   the power injection points turned out to be substations
"Cascavel" - 230 kV, "Campo Mourao" - 230 kV and"Guaira
- Ilha Grande' - 230 kV.
*   the  superposition of a 230 kV system was postponed for
a long period of time.
*   all interconnections will be at 138 kV.
This solution was adopted, is now being implemented and
must   be  concluded  in  1990  with  the  construction  of
substation "Guaira" - 230 kV.
m.  SUBSTATION "SARANDI" - 138 kV
Works postponed rt 1990 owing to the fact that the region
was served by the 34.5 kV system through the construction
of a 34.5/138 kV substation.

n. SUBSTATION  "PATO  BRANCO"  -  230  kv  -   EXTENSION   AND
SUBSTATION "CLEVELANDIA" - CONSTRUCTION
As  it  happened  with  Parana's  Coast  and  Middle Iguacu
Systems, these works will be significantly altered with the
reinsulation of the existing 69 kV system to 138 kV. The
works were reprogrammed and the reinsulation will be
started at Substation *Pato Branco' and must be concluded
by 1990.
o. substation "CATANDUVAS" - 69 kV - CONSTRUCTION
works cancelled due to a smaller charge growth and to the
reinforcement of the 34.5 kV system which serves the
region.
