PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUATEMALA - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1212-GGU))
PREFACE
The project completion report (PCR) for the Second Education
Project in Guatemala (Loan 1212-GU, in the amount of US$14.5 million) com-
pares the objectives defined at appraisal with actual achievements, and
analyzes the project outcomes and the issues concerning project implementa-
tion. The Loan Agreement was signed March 5, 1976; the original closing date
was June 30, 1979 but was delayed until June 30, 1983, and the final
disbursement was made in March 1984.
The PCR was prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean
Regional Office, following a mission to Guatemala (February 13-24, 1984), and
is based on:
Ca) a draft project completion report (DPCR) prepared by the Project
Implementation Unit (the last PIU for this project was Unidad de
Construcciones de Edificios Escolares-UCEE);'/
(b) the Bank's files related to the project, including Board Resolu-ion
No. 7624 (dated February 17, 1976), the Loan Agreement and the
Appraisal Report No. 926-GU (dated January 30, 1976);
(c) the findings of the mission; and
(d) the findings and recommendations of a team from the Research and
Planning Office of the Ministry of Education (Unidad Sectorial de
Investigacion y Planificacion Educativa-USIPE).
The Bank acknowledges the assistance of the borrower in the
preparation of the PCR, particularly of the PIU staff in preparing a DPCR and
the recommendations made by USIPE team.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this project completion report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff as
the project was a comparatively simple one and the PCR appears to give a good
account of the project experience.
The draft PCR was sent for comment to the Borrower and its agencies
in September 1985. No comments have been received.
1/   Project implementation was initiated by PEMEM (Program de Extension y
Mejoramiento de la Educacion Media of the MOE).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUATEMALA - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1212-GU))
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Second Education Project in Guatemala was appraised in April
1975 following preparation by the Government, and a Loan of US$14.5 million
was approved in February 1976. Total project costs were estimated at US$22.1
million. Actual costs of the project have amounted to US$31.1 million. The
Closing Date of the Loan, originally December 31, 1979, was extended twice.
The loan account was finally closed in March 1984 when the small sum of
US$14,500 remaining in it was cancelled.
Objectives
The principal objectives of the project were (a) to continue Bank
support for pre-vocational secondary education; (b) to improve access to
education for disadvantaged groups; and (c) to improve educational data.
These objectives were intended to be achieved by constructing and equipping
21 secondary schools; providing equipment for another eight schools; training
700 staff as teachers and administrators; financing technical assistance and
fellowships and relevant studies.
Implementation Experience
This project suffered serious implementation delays during its
first phase of operation; meeting the conditions of loan effectiveness alone
took 12 months. The project was adversely affected by the priority given to
the reconstruction of schools damaged in the 1976 earthquake, changes in
school sites, cumbersome goverment procedures and, on occasion, lack of
counterpart funds.
Implementation improved dramatically in 1982 when a new project
implementation unit director took over, and three separate school construc-
tion units were amalgamated. The outstanding problems concerning school
sites were resolved and loan disbursements accelerated. However, the
original delays could not be made up and project implementation lasted eight
years, twice as long as had originally been expected. The increase in
project costs is largely attributable to this delay.
Results
An additional school was constructed additional to those envisaged
at appraisal; as a result the total number of school places provided under
the project increased from 9,800 to 11,200. The additional enrollment made
possible, taking account of multisessional operation, has increased from
17,400 to about 20,000. At the time of the PCR mission however the schools
were still developing and their enrollment was only 6,700. Problems have



- vi -
been experienced with the initial operation of the schools; these problems
are expected to be temporary.
The software elements of the project have been generally well
implemented: nearly 200 administrators and over 700 teachers have been
trained, and the training program has also had Important institutional
development effects. The training program for secondary school teachers,
handled by three local universities, was particularly successful in training
teachers for practical subjects, including agriculture. The training
programs for teachers of agricultural subjects were less successful, though
even here educational technologies not previously used have been introduced
into the curriculum. The study component of the project was also successful,
providing inputs into the curriculum development efforts already noted.
Sustainability
A practically-oriented curricul'm is more costly than a more
theoretical curriculum because smaller classes are called for, together with
consumable stores. In part these costs can be recovered by the sale of
school produce, but this is insufficient to meet the increased costs
entirely. Thus strong commitment from the Government is required for the
benefits of a project such as this to be sustained. It is difficult to judge
whether this commitment will continue or not. It seems that non-project
schools will continue to teach the traditional curricula because they lack
the resources (qualified teachers, equipment, laboratories and workshops) to
implement the practical courses as designed for the project institutions.
Thus, countrywide examinations in the subjects included in the new curricula
may not be developed. In addition, the non-formal training programs for
adults have not been developed. The sustainability of project benefits is
thus rather problematic.
Findings and Lessons
(i) Some covenants and conditions were over ambitious. The Bank should
limit the number of covenants to those that are directly related to the
project and that can be monitored adequately (paras. 2.16, 5.03 and Annex 3);
(ii) There were minor problems with technical assistance. However,
accepting technical assistance from local agencies proved to be feasible and
cost effective in the Guatemalan context. This practice should be encouraged
in future projects (para. 5.04);
(iii) Education programs were somewhat fragmented in two different
ministries and there was poor coordination in the Technical Committee under
the Ministry of Communications and Public Works (para. 2.01(b)). In future
education/training projects in Guatemala the Bank should verify that the unit
in charge of implementing the program is adequately staffed, and that the
coordinating committee has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Education and has been given clear terms of reference before the loan is
made; and
(iv) The scattered placement of buildings on sites resulted in high
ratios (40Z in some cases) of circulation and covered walkway areas to
available space. More concentrated arrangements of buildings should be
sought in future projects (para. 2.08).



I. OBJECTIVES AND CONTENT OF THE PROJECT
1.01      Although development of this project began in July 1972 with a
UNESCO project identification mission and was partly prepared by the
government with CONESCAL/Bank assistance in early 1973, it was eAchdrawn from
consideration in 1974 because: (a) the government wished to seek softer
leading terms from the Inter-American Development Bank (TUB); and (b) a
conflict had arisen between the Bank and the government during that year over
the bid award for a proposed power project. Preparation was reinitiated
after a Bank mission in February/March 1975. The Bank appraised the request
ia April 1975, negotiations took place in December 1975, and the Loan
Agreemeat was signed on March 5, 1976, but did not become effective until
April 1977 due to delays in obtaining congressional approval. Project
uCmmlzation (omitting the time lost i" the conflict) took about 24 months
which is 3 months less than the average preparation time (27 months) for an
average education project.
Project Objectives
1.02      The three priacipal objectives of this project were:  (a) to
continue assisting the goverament in improving the quality of secondary
educatioa initiated by the First Education Project (Loan 576-GU) through
teacher and administrative staff training, curriculum development, technical
assistance and additional learning equipment; (b) to correct unequal access
to education by:
(i) catering to those students who will not pursue higher education,
including Indian students, who need to learn agricultural skills;
(ii)  expanding school opportunities for lower (grades 7-9) and upper
,grades 10-12) secondary education students;
and (c) to improve the educat±onal data collected on secondary education
through a series of studies.
ProJect Content/Revisions
1.03       The project content at appraisal and the subsequent revisions are
summarized as follows:
(a) building, furnishing and equipping the educatioaal institutions
listed in Table 1.1;
(b) providing additional equipment for the Agricultural Technical
Institute (ITA) and seven secondary schools constructed as part of
the First Educatioa Project (Loan 576-GU);
(c) providing pre-service and in-service trainiag for approximately
600 teachers of pre-vocational subjects, and 100 administrative
staff and school supervisors;



- 2 -
(d)  allocating technical assistance (TA) in the form of 132 staff/
months of specialist services for technical assistRace and 540
staff/months of fellowships for training educators, supervisors and
Ministry of Education (MOE) officers abroad; and
(e) financing some education research studies.

Target Groups
1.04       The project strove to improve access to education for (a) poor,
secondary school age childrea in marginal urban areas and medium sizad
cities; (b) Indian children in the highlands, whose participation iln
secondary schooling was less than that of the non-Indian students; (c) the



- 3 -
chlldren of the small farms in rural areas, whose agricultural education and
training had been neglected. It also strove to improve the quality of
education by providing in-service and pre-service trainiag for teachers
of practical disciplines and for school administrators, who needed to upgrade
their qualifications to implement the new pre-vocational curriculum. The
project was .o construct about 9,400 new student places in secondary schools
and 390 boarding places ia agricultural schools, put in place nontraditional
secondary school curriculum, in-service training, techaical assistance, and
conduct studies to consolidate basic education information. Finally, by
using double and multiple shifts the project was to serve about 17,370
students, as indicated in Table 1.1.
Explanation of Revisions
1.05      The only major revisions involved modifying the technical
assistance program, changing the feasibility studies, and relocating school
sites. The re-siting of the CFCs was done to reduce the number of students
commuting from poor neighborhoods to the center of Guatemala City, and to
provide a lower secondary school (originally planned for the CFC of Zone 10)
where it was more urgently required (Zone 19), as explained in Annex 1. The
changes in TA and in the studies are explained in Table 1.2.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
2.01       The project required eight years (1976-1983) to complete instead
of the four (1976-1979) originally planned (Annex 2). It was stalled for
nearly four years because of:
(a) difficulties in obtaining congrespional approval due to local
political problems (first year);
(b) problems with the functioning of the Technical Committee (La
Comision Coordiaadora de Aspectos Cualitativos - CCAC, under the
MOPW), which was to coordinate teacher training, curriculum
development, techaical assistance and compilation of master lists
for equipment and furniture at the central level (first three
years);
(c) changes In school sites;
(d) delays in contract approval by both the Ministries of Education and
of Finance owing to cumbersome bureaucratic procedures;
(e) lack of counterpart funds (the first two years);
(f) unsatisfactory management during the first phase of project
implementation; and
(g) changes ia priorities following the earthquake of 1976.

Project Management Organization
2.02      The project faced its most critical problems just after its
iaitiation (1976 - early 1982) because of poor management, lack of government
commitment and the change in priorities to repair schools damaged in the 1976
earthquake. With the aew administ.ration (March 1982) there was increased
governmeat support and many beaeficial changes were made, including a change
in the organization and staffing of the Pil.
2.03      First Period (1976-1982).  Because of the satisfactory performance
of PEMEM (Programa de Extension y Mejoramiento de Educacion Media) which was
the PIU in the First Education Project, the government, in agreement with the
Bank, designated PEMEM as the agency responsible for most of the physical
aspects of the Second Project. Other areas such as educational aspects and
technical assistance, fell to the care of the Department of Secondary
Education and USIPE (Sector Unit for Education Research and Planning of the
MOE - Unidad Sectorial de Icvestigacion y Planificacion Educativa). A
Technical Committee, comprised of representatives of the Ministries of
Education, Agriculture and the PIU, was to coordinate the project activities
by: (a) analyzing and reviewing architectural designs and specifications for
equipment and furniture to ensure suitability, and (b) reviewiag the
proposals for technical assistance.
2.04       Due to the lack of full government support (i.e., as reflected in
the slowness of decision taking concerning school sites, curriculum, contract
approval and, at times, allocation of counterpart funds) aad due to the
inadequacies of the Technical Committee (personality conflicts, lack of
motivation to attend coordinating meetings and the incapacity of those
meetings to take needed critical decisions), the performance of PE4EM was
less than satisfactory during the first period of project implementation.
This was aggravated by several changes in the senior staff of the unit (there
were three different senior architects and four educators). The Bank's
efforts to improve the situation were successful only in the short run; a
lasting solution was not found until the change in administration.
2.05      Second Period (1982-1984).  Under a new Minister of Education, the
project became more dynamic and efficient because of increased government
support. The authorities ensured that counterpart funds were readily
available and made final decisioas on the selection of three schools sites.
In addition, the Ministry of Communications and Public Works appointed a new
PEMEM Director, whose first task was to address the outstanding problems in
both the physical and software implementation of the project, including
personnel problems. In agreement with the Bank, the aew PEMEM Director
undertook a complete overhaul of the PIU, which resulted in the creation of
a new project implementation unit-UCEE-from absorption of CONACE (MOE's
National Center for School Construction) and the Bank-financed project
implementation units under the Ministry of Communications and Public Works:
PEMEM itself and CEEP (Unidad de Construccion de Edificios Escolares para el
Proyecto de Educacion Primaria). From this point, the performance of the
project was more than satisfactory.



-6-
School Sites
2.06      By the time of the first Bank supervision mission (March 1976), 15
sites out of 21 had been selected. However, their final acquisition faced
continuous problems:
(a) the unit of USIPE charged with selecting and acquiring sites for
all public schools had to refer its decisions on school sites to at
least three Ministries (Education, Finance, and Public Works);
(b)  selection of sites in the marginal urban areas of Guatemala City
and other medium sized cities proved to be difficult and costly;
(c) payment for some sites using 100% government funds was difficult
because of budgetary constraints, particularly during 1979-80; and
(d) the government changed its decision orn the location of the two CFCs
(Table 1.1) to avoid transportation problems.
2.07       Although the Bank's new policies concerning the timing of site
acquisition and the lessons learned from the site related problems have
already been taken into accouat in processing the Third Education Project
(Loan 2328-GU), for future projects the cost of sites should be clearly
stated in the financial plaa of the project, so that the goverament is
prepared to meet all necessary expenditures. In addition, since site related
drawbacks have been reported in other PCRs (Colombia III, Dominican Republic
I and II, Peru I, among others) the Bank should seriously consider the
inclusion of a lump sum in the so-called -revolving working fund", for
short term financing of site acquisition, so that the Government of
Guatemala, as well as other borrowers, will not be hindered from acquirilng
sites ia the early stages of implementation by lack of capital.
Designs
2.08      Designs, which had been contracted to nine private firms, were
adequate. Most met the educational specifications set out ia the schedule of
accommodation prepared with Bank assistance, and the majority (17 out of 21)
fully met standards of function and comfort, and complied with architectural
briefs prepared by the PIU. However, four designs for schools in Antigua,
Quetzaltenango, and Zones 7 and 19 did not meet the standards. Their most
important weaknesses were:
(a) scattered placement of buildings on the sites (versus arrangement
in clusters), which resulted in a high ratio of circulation and
covered walkway areas to available space (40% in some cases);
(b) designs specifying large multipurpose rooms, imported windows and
internal concrete gutters (subject to cloggiog and leaking) proved
to be unnecessarily sophisticated and expensive; and
(c) lack of dropped ceilings in areas where insulation is necessary, so
that some schools are too hot on sunny days and too cold in the
winter.



- 7 -
2.09      In retrospect, these problems could have been minimized if the PIU
Director had taken into accouat the experiences of the First Education
Project and the Bank's recommendations concerning designs (see letter of July
1977). Lack of follow up was an oversight in Bank supervision.
Civil 'xorks
2.10      As discussed in Table 1.1, about 9,790 additional student places
were built. Procurement for civil works proceeded in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. Building contractors were pre-qualified and contracts
were awarded on the basis of locally advertised, competitive bidding
(Sche4ule 4 of Loan Agreement). Except for two schools (Zone 5 and Peten),
th, -ie.-ige time of construction was about 18 months, normal In the
Guacemalan context. Construction supervision was the responsibility of the
PIU. The performance of both supervisors and contractors was satisfactory.
Not only is the quality of construction good, but the project completion
mission (PCM) reported that the schools already in operation were functional
and easy to maintain. The two CFCs are also functional but have not begun
full academic operations.
Furniture and Equipment
2.11      The procurement of furniture proceeded without major problems,
following local competitive bidding procedures.  The quality of furniture is
good. There were some minor distribution errors (student desks for the
primary education project under Loan 1314-GU were sent to some secondary
schools under Loan 1212-GU and vice versa), which the PIU Director promised
to correct at the time of the PCM. Most of the equipment was procured
following international competitive bidding procedures and most of the
deliveries took place during January/ February 1984. Two problems are worth
mentioning here:
(a)  Inadequate Specifications.  The agency in charge of preparing the
master lists did so without participation of MOE staff. Therefore,
some expensive equipment is too sophisticated for the intended
users and is lying idle; and
(b)  Distribution Errors.  Some schools were assigned and received
equipment which they did not need, while others did not receive
equipment which had beea purchased for them. For example, the
schools in Tecpan and San Pablo Jacopilas asked the PIU Director to
exchange two laundry machines erroneously delivered to each for the
additional equipment they required in woodworking shops.
2.12      Bank correspondence (letters of June and July 1978) and early
supervisioa efforts to correct the above situation were aot successful.
While the situation ia (b) has now been corrected, to address point (a), the
government should be advised that the idle equipment be redistributed among
technical/vocational schools, which can effectively use it.



-8-
Maintenance
2.13      Routine maintenance is being carried out by the schools themselves
in the absence of a budget allocation from MOE. In addition, maintenance
programs are being implemented by the PIU for those schools which are still
under the six month liability period as specified in the legal agreement.
The PCM advised the PIU Director to take into account the observations/
reco-mendatioas offered by the USIPE team in March 1984. The Bank should
advise the Government of Guatemala that most of the equipment and furniture
will need to be replaced in 10-15 years so that the cost may be incorporated
in budgetary planning for the future.
Technical Assistance, Training and Studies
2.14      The technical assistance program was combined with teacher and
school administrator in-service training. These programs and the studies
were contracted to three local universities and to UNESCO, following
locally advertised competitive bidding in which at least three international
organizations (UNESCO, Organization of American Stqtes, IDB) took part.
Table 1.2 sunmarizes these combined activities.
2.15      Except for the INTECAP program (Table 1.2, para. 4.07), most of the
goals of the technical assistance and teacher training program were met
successfully. Their overall impact depends on the commitment of the new
administration to: (a) act on recommendations concerning the curriculum for
teacher trainers and for the secondary school system; (b) appoint and retain
the newly trained teachers and school administrators; and (c) implement the
fellowship program noted in Table 1.2.
Compliance with Covenants
2.16      Annex 3 gives the details of compliance with covenants.  The points
of noncompliance are briefly analyzed below.
(a)  Section 3.01(c):  the establishment of a Consejo de Administracion
for the agricultural institutions included in the project, to
coordinate curriculum development in the subsector.   It was
established, but it has not met regularly because of weak
management at the Ministry of Agriculture and within the
institutions themselves.
(b)  Section 3.06:  the establishment of the special techaical
committee which icclude, inter alia, representatives of the
Ministries of Education, of Agriculture and of Public Works. Due
to internal problems and personality conflicts, the technical
committee had difficulty meeting regularly, particularly during the
first period of project implementation. Although committee action
is generally a good way to address inter-organizational problems,
the PCM thinks that the Bank did not assess properly the location
of the committee leadership, which rested with the MCPW. Alterna-
tively, the coordinating responsibilities should have rested with
the MOE, which has the main responsibility for education. This
alternative is being utilized in Loan 2328-GU and seems to be
working well.



-9-
(c)  Section 3.08(d):  the establishment of tracer mechanisms for
systematic follow up of secondary student dropouts, graduates and
their subsequent patterns of employment.   Despite the assistance
provided by the Baak du.ring supervisioa, the government showed no
interest in carrying out this work. This was mainly because the
government did not forsee any major investment at the secondary
education level. Hence, this item was deleted from the project
(Supervision Report of November 1, 1982).
2.17      Bank Performance.   The project was visited by a total of 17
supervision missions representiag 23.6 staff weeks of field work. More than
half of the missions (10) were staffed by educators, architects, or
engineers, and seven by a combination of specialists. There were at least
two missions per year. There was continuity of staff providing supervisioa,
only two architects, four educators and one sociologist were involved. In
addition, there were at least six trips to Bank headquarters by the PIU
Director to discuss implementation problems and solutions.
2.18      The Bank was flexible, twice agreeing to an extension of the
closing date. It was also prompt in responding to the crisis following the
earthquake in 1976, combining some of the selected schools sites for Loan
1212-GU with those of the reconstruction project under Loan 1314-GU (Schools
of Zone 7). There are two key points concerning the Baak's performance in
monitoring the technical assistance and teacher training:
(a)  the contracting of the TA and training programs to local agencies
is an experience worth repeating, because (i) it promoted
collaboration between local universities and government agencies,
(ii) it stimulated a great deal of involvement from local staff of
the university community, (iii) it generated new ideas concerning
curriculum development, teacher training and school mapping,
(iv) it produced reports and materials acceptable in operational
terms (copy in LAC files), and (v) it involved some university
staff in TA (the Vice-Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of
Education) who are aow in a position to make decisions on the
recommendations of the studies; and
(b)  the Ban: has not found an effective means of monitoring the long
term staffing plan and the proposed curriculum changes aationwide,
except for continued dialogues in future projects.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
3.01       The total project cost at completion was USS31.1 million, or about
412 more than the appraisal estimates. Civil works, equipment, project
administratioa and the studies absorbed their planned share of the budget and
more than their expected share of contingencies. The studies category
escalated 193% because preparatioa of the Third Education Project was
included in this component. Administration rose 102% and civil works 75Z.



- 10 -
Other categories (furniture, professional services, teacher training,
technical assistance) used less than cheir original budget. Details of the
costs are shown in Annex 4 and summarized in Table 3.1.

* Inflation over the implementation period averaged 6%.
3.02      Civil works exceeded appraisal estimates (contingencies included)
by 75%. The reasons for this increase were (a) overall inflation,
particularly following the earthquake of 1976, which not only affected the
country's economy but impacted on the construction industry particularly
(Annexes 5 and 6), (b) the need to modify designs to make them earthquake
resistant, (c) the greater aumber of classrooms were provided (30 more than
planned), which increased gross costs 8% (Aanexes 7 and 8), and (d) the
sophistication of some of the designs which pushed up construction costs.

The locally procured furniture was 30% cheaper than appraisal estimates, but
there were some delivery problems. As mentioned in Table 3.1, the studies
component increased the most on a perceatage basis because project
preparation expenditures for Loan 2328-GU were financed through this item.
The government financed the additional cost of about US$9.0 million
equivalent.
IV. OPERATIONAL OUTCOMES
4.01      The project has now (a) provided facilities (buildings, equipment,
furaiture) enabling the secondary education system to iacrease its enrollment
and give students access to a practically oriented curriculum in the project
schools; (b) located facilities in the marginal urban areas of Guatemala and
in medium sized cities (Annex 1), allowing the system to cater to the
education needs of specified groups (urban students and poor rural Indian
youths); and (c) the project is enhancing the quality and efficiency of
secondary education through teacher training, curriculum development,
technical assistance and studies. However, critical problems have occurred
surrounding operational expenditures, the policies concerning the hiring of
teachers, adequate organization of the CFCs, complete implementation of some
practical courses in the secondary school curriculum, and the nonformal
training programs for adults have yet to be organized. Furthermore, the
in-service training programs on education planning and school administration
and pre-vocational subjects, being contracted with INTECAP, have yet to be
implemented.

4.03       Access to Secoadary Education.  The project's broad educational
objective of extending secondary education facilities to the marginal urban
areas of Guatemala and to the medium sized cities has not yet been fully
achieved due to:
(a)  the limited operation of some project institutions; three lower
secondary schools, one combined lower/upper secondary institution
are not in full operation. This helps to explain the difference
between the planned and actual enrollment in lower secondary
institutions;
(b)  the delays in opening the CFCs, which should have increased
enrollment at least by 4,500; and
(c)  the under-enrollment at the two agricultural schools which are
currently at 50% capacity, because they have been in operation only
one year.
4.04      However, these problems are temporary; the government plans to
address them in the academic year commencing February 1985.
4.05       Quality Improvements.  Technical assistance provided by the project
enabled the government to implement the project efficiently and allowed
studies to be conducted which collected and analyzed data on education
subsectors and resulted in specific recommendations for further improvement.
In teacher training, the TA program trained about 900 teachers and school
administrators for the project schools, as described in Table 4.2.

4.06       The training program also produced important institutional
developments- First, the planning, programming and implementing of the
various training subprograms were undertaken by staff from two universities,
San Carlos University (SCU) and University del Valle (UDV'); in return they
were provided with theoretical models for training teachers and school
administrators designed by Rafael Landivar University (RLU). This work was
the result of a lively discussion and interaction among at least 50 local
university staff who were directly involved in teacher training. Second, a
good training model was created, tested and used for the training of teacher
trainers ia practical disciplines (subprogram No. I in Table 4.2). It
consisted of a "sandwich" training course for prospective teacher trainers (a
regular two year university training period leading to six months of
supervised student-teacher practice in the field and followed up by a month's
evaluation at the University). Supervision was carried out by SCU staff and
cooperating teachers of project schools.   The model is practical,
replicable, and worth using elsewhere. The PCM saw therevised curriculum in
several schools where new crops were being grown with modern agricultural
techniques (i.e. small green houses for seedings, plastic covers for
protection against excessive rain, and natural fertilizers for nitrogen
fixation) and food preservation skills were being taught in the home
economics courses. These skills will indeed enhance the quality of life of
the students and their communities. Its unit cost (about US$200 staff/month
of training) is reasonqble.
4.07      The training programs for teachers of agricxiltural subjects were
less successful. Only 50% of ITA staff attended the courses offered.
However, the ITA participants introduced innovations and educational
technologies into the ITA curriculum, which had not previously been used.
For example, a well-designed entrance exam was used to select new students in
1983. ITA participants were given a course on "Evaluation Technologies" and
gained experience in efficient approaches to training by visiting
agricultural agencies dealirg with agricultural fertilizers, pest control,
and genetics. In-service training of ITA administrators and teachers was
also begun. A permanent student evaluation unit at ITA was established with
the technical assistance provided under the project. The borrower should be
asked to accelerate the implementation of the in-service training programs
which have been contracted by INTECAP.
4.08      The project also made several useful studies concerning curricula
for the project institutions. A team of curriculum specialists from RLU
(one of the TA agencies), in cooperation with MOE staff, prepared,
curricula syllabi for lower and upper secondary project schools in practical
subjects, and worked out a good course proposal for training teacher trainers
in practical disciplines.  The RLU team findings and recommendations or
curriculum are now used in the project institutions that were operating at
the time of the PCM. Although it is expected that all project institutions
will follow the curricula syllabi noted above, it is likely that the
nonproject schools will continue to teach the traditional syllabi because
existing public schools lack the resources (equipment, laboratories and
workshops, and qualified teachers) to implement the practical courses as
designed for the project institutions. Hence, the expansion of the



- 14 -
practically oriented courses would require additional resources (buildings,
equipment, qualified teachers).  Fiaally, the aonformal training programs for
adults have yet to to be developed.
4.09      Adult Training Programs.  Except for the nonformal training
prc rams being organized at the agricultural schools (paras. 1.07 and 4.02),
the_e is no evidence at the moment that some of the lower and upper secondary
schools are being used for nonformal training programs as it was originallY
envisaged (at least 10 of these schools were to be used). Therefore, the
government should be advised to follow up on this plan for nonformal training
programs, in addition to the formal education programs, which are aow being
implemented on their premises.
V. LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      Lessons were learned in four major areas by both the Bank and the
Government of Guatemala in the implementation of Loan 1212-GU.
5.02      Selection of Sites.  Final selection and acquisition of school
sites proved to be a major cause for delay in project implementation (paras.
2.07 and 2.08). Despite agreement on the selection of 70% of the sites at
appraisal, the final acquisition was held up because a number of schools had
to be re-sited to fulfill project objectives. Cumbersome procedures and lack
of resources to pay for the sites, also slowed the acquisition process. This
lesson has been taken into account in the processing of Loan 2328-GU, well
over 3O0 of the school sites were selected prior to Board presentation of
this project. The Bank should:
(a)  continue to insist on advanced site selection and acquisition,
which is critical for adequate and timely execution of future
education projects(paras. 2.06 and 2.07); and
(b)  include estimates of site costs in the total project cost, so that
the government can budget the necessary expenditures (para. 2.07).
5.03      Compliance with Covenants.  Some covenants and conditions were
inadequate or over ambitious (para. 2.16 (b) and (c)). There are at least
two lessons learned from the experience with these covenants; these have
already been taken into account in Loan 2328-GU. The first is that in
Guatemala there should be two separate project implementation units: one for
the implementation of educational programs and another for physical aspects.
The second is that technical coordinating committee of education matters did
not function well under the MCPWs. It may work best under the chairmanship
of the MOE, which will take initiative in establishing educational policies,
guidelines, norms and educational specifications for school building, then
discuss them with the directors of other PIUs. Hence, for future education
projects in Guatemala the Bank should:



- 15 -
(a) continue to insist on the need to have two separate implementation
units: one for educational programs and another for physical
aspects; and
(b) exercise caution in preparing covenaats concerning technical
coordinating committees, assessing the idea that they may be better
located in the MOE instead of the MCPWs.
5.04      Technical Assistance.  Accepting technical assistance from local
agencies proved to be feasible and cost efficient in the Guatemalan context
(paras. 2.14 and 2.15). However, support from external executing agencies
(para. 2.14 and Table 1.2), particularly in the areas where local expertise
is not available (in Guatemala: school mapping, planning and programming of
fellowships, computer assisted educational technology) should be expected.
Therefore, joint ventures of local and foreign organizations should be
encouraged in Guatemala to provide technical assistance in future projects.
5.05      Monitoring of Educational Programs.  In view of the problems
associated with site selection and acquisition, and with the procurement of
the hardware elements of the project, the PIU management (the Director, an
assistant and two senior architects) concentrated on monitoring the physical
aspects of the project, delegating the coordination of the education aspects
to a single educator at first, and later to two supervisors. In future
before making a loan, the Bank should verify that the unit in charge of
implementing education programs is adequately staffed and that the committee
coordinating educational components has been placed under the jurisdiction of
the MOE and has been given clear terms of reference.   This committee will
give guidelines and education specifications to the physical implementation
unit (under the MCPWs), which should be only in charge of building schools.
5.06      The Bank should be prepared to assist the government in following
up these recommendations during supervision missions for Loan 2328-GU.
