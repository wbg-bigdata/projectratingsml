REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$14.5 million to the Republic of Guatemala for
a second education project. The loan would have a term of 3U years including
10 years of grace, with interest at 8-i percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "Memorandum of Recent Economic Development
and Prospects of Guatemala" (Report No. 681-GU) was distributed to the
Executive Directors in March 1975. An economic mission is scheduled for
June Ic-76.   A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Guatemala has the largest population and the most diverse physical
environment among the five countries in the Central American Common Market.
The varied climate and rich soils allow the cultivation of almost any type
of agricultural product. There are some mineral resources, especially
nickel,which will be commercially exploited with the participation of IFC
and marble quarries with a good potential for export. Some exploration for
oil is under way. Guatemala's natural beauty, climate, archeological monu-
ments, folklore and proximity to the United States give her a high potential
for tourism development. Most of the country's population and economic acti-
vity is in the highlands. The principal food crops -- corn and beans -- are
grown there; most of the coffee is grown on the southern highland slopes.
Nearly all the major urban centers and most of the country's industrial acti-
vities are located in the highlands.
4.        Guatemala's population has been growing at between 2 to 3 percent
per annum and now totals about 5.2 million. The most significant characteristic
of the population is its sharp ethnic division. The pure Indians, who make
up about 4O percent of the total population, are economically, culturally
and linguistically separated from the rest of the population, which is mainly

-2-
of mixed Spanish and Indian origin. A large part of the Indian population
does not participate in the money economy. They are engaged in subsistence
agriculture and have a standard of living well below that of most of the
rest of the population.
5.        The economy has been growing at an average rate of 6.5 percent
per annum for the past four years and at close to 6 percent when the slightly
deteriorating terms of trade are taken into account. The main impetus for
this growth was the growing volume of exports. Provided the present OECD
countries' recession does not significantly weaken the country's traditional
exports for a lengthy period of time, the economy can continue to grow in
the next few years at rates similar to those of the recent past.
6.        Although Central Government savings increased significantly in 1973,
they reached only 1.4 percent of GDP. Both current revenues and current expendi-
tures remained at a low level. Central Go ernment investment,however, reached
2.9 percent of GDP in 1973, which represents an all time high for Guatemala.
Investment in the social areas increased by more than 100 percent compared
to 1972, especially in education and health. During 1974, sharp increases
in the price of construction materials resulted in a decline of Government
i+vestment in real terms.   Largely to offset inflationary cost increases in
the face of an inelastic revenue system, the last administration during the
first half of 1974 proposed to raise tax rates and to establish new export
taxes but these measures were substantially modified as they passed through
Congress. As finally enacted, new export taxes were introduced for sugar, beef
and fish, and a more progressive sliding scale (tied to world price movements)
was adopted for export taxes on coffee and cotton, the two most important
export commodities. The new law, however, estaolished a very high cut-off price
before these taxes have effect, and partly because of this, when a new Govern-
ment came into power in July 1974, it proposed, and the Congress approved, an
additional tax package which was expected to permit a slight improvement in
the share of current revenues in GDP during 1975 and to enable revenues to
continue to grow at roughly the same rate as GDP during the next few years.
Current expenditures, however, would need to grow more rapidly than GDP to
ensure a successful implementation of the new development program outlined
below.
7.        The investment program for 1975-79 places considerable emphasis
on two areas. It gives high priority to accelerating investments in the
electric energy sector, where rapid action is required to prevent a shortage
of energy capacity from becoming a bottleneck to the development of the
economy, and it stresses the need to increase the productivity of small and
medium-sized farmers. Rural sector objectives are expected to be achieved
through Government invesumerlt in infrastructure, in marketing and credit
facilities, and in technologicil improvements. In addition, the plan contem-
plates consolidation of small farms into larger family size units.



-3-
8.        The Government's program for 1975-79 would imply more than
doubling the level of public investment and substantial increases in
current expenditures. Even though full achievement of the investment
targets may be difficult because of weaknesses in their project content,
there is ample capacity for raising public investment substantially
above past levels if steps are taken to improve fiscal performance.
The 1975-79 Development Plan proposes an increases in the tax effort
from the present 7.5 percent of GDP to 10 percent by the end of the decade,
which should permit a substantial increase in public savings.
9.        The balance of payments has been strong in recent years, in particular
in 1973, when foreign exchange reserves increased by US$67.0 million and
Central Bank reserves attained an all time high of US$213.8 million, the equi-
valent of five months' imports, at the end of the year. This was possible
(despite an increase of nearly 25 percent in the value of imports) because of
a substantial improvement in the prices of coffee and cotton, an increase
in sugar volume, and an increase of more than 37 percent in the value of
manufactured exports. Tourism continued its strong growth of previous years.
lt is estimated that for 197h, although receipts from exports of goods and
services increased by about 33 percent, payments for imports increased by
about 60 percent, mainly because of fuel price increases and speculative
stockpiling of raw materials and intermediate goods. The net impact of these
developments was a shift from n USO$3.0 million current account surplus in
197' to a US$75.0 million deficit in 197L, and a decline by about US$10.0
million in net reserves for the year.    (Preliminarv data for 1974 inetcate
that the current account deficit reached US$100.0 million, but that an
exceptionally large inflow of capital resulted in a substantial increase
in net reserves.)
10.       Over the medium-term, coffee will continue to be the single most
important export, while tourism is expected to continue to grow at a high
rate and become the second most important foreign exchange earner. Manu-
factured products are expected to increase their share of merchandise exports
and, by 1977, nickel will be added to mineral exports, accountirg for about
6 percent of merchandise exports thereafter. Even though exports are expected
to continue to grow at a satisfactory rate, the stepped up public investment
program, together with a projected increase in private investment activity,
will be reflected in a widening of the resource gap and, therefore, a need for
increasing amounts of external assistance. As noted above, the Government
intends to increase public savings substantially; however, measures to achieve
this have to be prepared with care and will, in any event, take some time
before they are fully effective. Meanwhile, the Government must rely on some
external financing in excess of the foreign exchange cost of its foreign
financed projects.
11.       Guatemala is in a position substa&tially to increase foreign borrowing
on conventional terms without impairing its creditworthiness.    The external piDlic debt



repayable in foreign currency amounted to US$210.0 million at the end of 1974,
of which US$123.0 million had been disbursed. Guatemala's debt-service ratio
has been relatively low in the past and has been reduced further by the last
two years' fast export growth. The average terms of the external public debt
have improved substantially over the last few years as a result of increased
borrowing from international financial institutions. A debt-service level of
about 3 percent of exports is expected to be maintained for the remainder of
the decade.
12.       Apart from the Bank, external financing has been provided princi-
pally by USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). IDB funds have carried a
substantial concessional element and contained large components repayable
in local currency. The IDB has made loans for agriculture (credit, irriga-
tion and fisheries), housing, transportation, water supply and health
services. USAID has financed mainly rural development and primary education,
but has also granted loans for industrial development, rural electrification,
housing and health facilities. CABEI has concentrated mainly on projects
with regional impact in highways, telecommunications, agriculture and in-
dustry. The lending of these agencies from 1950 to the end of 1974 is sum-
marized below:

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       Guatemala to date has received seven Bank loans, totalling US$92.5
million.  The last operation, a loan for a second telecommunications project,
amounting to US$26.0 million, was signed on April 29, 1975. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of December 31,
1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
le.      Apart from a loan for a first education project, the Bank has provided
assistance through two loans for power, two loans for telecommunications and
one loan each for highways and livestock development. After an initial loan
for highways, made in 1955, the Bank suspended operations in Guatemala because
of the failure of successive Guatemalan Governments to settle a dispute regard-
ing three outstanding sterling bond issues. Following settlement of the
sterling debt, the Bank resumed lending to Guatemala in 1967.
15.       In its future lending activities in Guatemala, aside frcm continuing to
assist Government programs in education and training, the Bank is planning (1)
to support developmental initiatives in the more traditional sect'xs where
we expect to be able to make a meaningful contribution to sectoral objectives,
and (2) to give increased emphasis to the rural sector. In power and telecom-
munications, the Bank would help to meet the growing resource requirements, and
to strengthen major institutions operating in these sectors. In power, the
3ank has been reviewing with the Government and the power generating company
Guatemala's future energy requirements and the possibility of the Bank's pro-
viding financing for two major hydro-electric projects. Given the size of the
envisaged power investment program, the Bank would also help to mobilize the
external financing required beyond what the Bank might be in a position to
consider. In the rural sector, the Bank is participating in an analysis of
Guatemala's agricultural plans and programs, which is being conducted as part
of a joint IBERD, IDB and AID agricultural and rural survey of the five Central
American countries. It is hoped, through this process, to identify specific
rural development projects and, more broadly, to help the Government to carry
out its expressed intention to give high priority to rural sector development.
In addition to lending directly for agriculture, our intention is to direct
the major part of planned support for transport development to roads directly
benefiting the rural sector.
16.       It is expected that the Bank's share of total external public debt
disbursed and outstanding will remain at about 20 percent on average through
1980.   The Bank's share of debt service in 1974 was 10 percent; it is pro-
jected to peak at 25.7 percent in 1979 and to decline thereafter.



-6-
18.       IFC has made two investments in Guatemala. The first, a US$200,000
loan in 1958 for a flour mill, has been fully repaid. The second, a loan
of US$15.0 million to Exploracianes y Explotaciones   Mineras Izabel, S.A.
(EXMIBAL), a Guatemalan company established to exploit a nickel ore deposit
at Lake Izabel in eastern Guatemala, was approved in July 1973. After some
initial delays in finalizing the project design and in arranging additional
financing made necessary by substantial cost overruns, construction is pro-
gressing satisfactorily and plant operation is expected to begin in lid-1977.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
19.       The fornal education system comprises six years of primary education,
six years of secondary education and courses varying in length from three
to six years at the higher level.
20.       The Ministry of Education has the major responsibility for formu-
lating policy and administering all formal and non-formal public education
institutions except higher education and certain specialized schools. Private
institutions account for about one-sixth of primary school enrollment, one-
half of secondary school enrollment and one-sixth of hkigher education en-
rollment. Various types of non-formal education and training are provided
by the Ministries of Education, Agriculture, Health and other public insti-
tutions. Education administration is highly centralized and weak because
of low salaries, incomplete professional training, and lack of coordination
among education institutions. The Government now proposes to reorganize
the Ministry of Education to improve and streamline management and to improve
non-formal education.
21.       The basic educational objectives, as outlined in the National
Development Plan for 1975-79, are to raise the literacy rate from 46.5
percent in 1973 to 57.2 percent by 1979 and 90 percent by the year 2000,
to increase educational opportunities outside Guatemala City, and to make
the entire system more relevant to requirements for trained manpower.
Primary Education
22.       In 1973 about 64 percent of all children aged 7-12 were enrolled in
primary education (grades 1-6). In urban areas about 50 percent of first grade
entrants completed the sixth grade, compared to only 3.5 percent in rural
areas. Two of the major causes of low primary school efficiency In rural
areas are the lack of complete primary schools (only 17 percent provide all



-7-
six grades), and in Indian areas, the need to learn an alien language
(Spanish) and culture.
23.       Over the next four years (1976-79) the Government proposes to increase
rural enrollments from 271,000 in 1975 to 379,000 in 1979, to improve promotion
rates in the first four grades from 52-58 percent to 62-90 percent, to re-
strict the enrollment age in first grade to those between 7 and 9, and to pro-
vide non-formal primary education to over-aged students. However, the resources
are not available to implement these ambitious goals, and a more likely target
date is 5 to 10 years later. USAID has been involved in assisting primary
education for some time and recently completed negotiations for a second loan
for primary school improvement and expansion.
Secondary Education
24.       In 1973 enrollment in lower secondary schools (grades 7-9) was equal
to about 18 percent of the 13-15 age group and in upper secondary schools
(grades 10-12) about 8 percent of the 16 to 18 age group.l" These figures are
low for Guatemala's level of economic development and for future middle level
manpower requirements. The predominance of fee-charging private institutions
restricts intake to middle class children, and the concentration of secondary
education facilities in Guatemala City, where 64 percent of total secondary
enrollment is located, restricts opportunity geographically. In addition,
qualified teachers are lacking in all areas, especially in practical subjects.
25.       In view of the numerous quantitative and qualitative problems,
particularly the shortage of qualified teachers, the Government has proposed
enrollment increases of 5 percent per annum to 1979 -- less than the average
increase of 8.5 percent per annum since 1966 -- with emphasis on growth outside
Guatemala City. These increases are likely to be achieved and probably
exceeded, especially through expansion of private education and locally orga-
nized "cooperative" schools partially aided by the central government.
26.       The Government's plans for improving the quality of secondary edu-
cation include: (a) expanded teacher training to produce qualified teachers
in the vocational areas; (b) implementing further new curricula with practical
subjects in both lower and upper secondary education; (c) strengthening
curriculum development, research, and other aspects of quality control at
the Ministry of Education; and (d) developing an information system on existing
physical and human resources in secondary and other levels of education and a
plan establishing priorities for future investments.
1/ Enrollment totals include overaged students.



-8-
Teacher Training
27.       With regard to teacher training, in 1973 almost 90 percent of
all primary school teachers were qualified graduates of upper secondary
teacher training schools, but these schools were producing about 1,600 per
year more than the 1,000 per year the primary system actually needed. At the
same time only about 4 percent of secondary school teachers had full univer-
sity level qualifications, and another 21 percent had other university training
or specialized secondary level certificates in art, music, home economics or
physical education. The rest of the secondary school teachers had only primary
school teachers' certificates.
28.       The Government's policy in primary school teacher training is to
restrict expansion and to begin to provide viable alternatives to the tradi-
tional upper secondary teacher trainirg course.  At the post-secondary
level, government policy is to encourage public and private universities
to expand their extension courses which provide university level certificates
to teachers of academic subjects, to continue to assist the National University
(San Carlos) in the preparation of science teachers (begun under the first
Bank-financed project), and to develop post-secondary training courses for
teachers of practical subjects. The Government pLans to utilize a number of'
institutions, including the two main universities, Jandivar (private) and
San C-tos (public), to ir.pDement the training programs for teachers of practica.
Agricultural Education
29.       The Government has begun a major effort to improve and expand
agricultural education in order to alleviate the existing shortage in the
number and quality of agricultural technicians. It intends to strengthen
further the Technical Agricultural Institute at Barcenas (supported under
the first Bank education project) and to improve the quality of its graduates.
It plans to establish two new experimental agricultural schools which
would train middle-level technicians for employment in government services, on
farms, in farmer youth clubs, and in proposed non-formal education activities
that would be conducted principally for the rural Indian population. These
schools have been included in the proposed second Bank project. The Government
would also offer pre-vocational agricultural education in lower secondary
schools included in the proposed project. The Government plans further to
expand farmer training through centers recently constructed with assistance
from USAID.



-9
Non-Formal Education
30.       In non-formal education the Government proposes rapid expansion
of existing institutions as well as creation of four new training programs
("educational modules") which correspond roughly to grades 1-4, 5-9, 10-12
and higher education in the formal system. The educational content of
these programs and their implementation are now being developed with
assistance from UNESCO, UNICEF and USAID.    In this regard, te Government
plans to reach 275,000 persons by 1979 with programs of information and
education, at grade levels 1-4, in agriculture, health and community deve-
lopment. A National Non-Formal Education Committee has begun to function,
and Guatemala has already developed some expertise in non-formal radio
education. In addition, the national apprenticeship institute (INTECAP)
is planning to expand its activities in Guatemala City and four provincial
cities with assistance from IDB. Guatemala's limited numbers of personnel
with the administrative, managerial, technical, instructional, and linguistic
skills needed to reach previously untouched populations will restrict rapid
expansion of these programs. Careful study of the environment and the
indigenous population will be required, and the programs will have to overcome
centuries of rural peasants' perception that the Government has not been
concerned with their welfare.
Financial Aspects
31.       Education expenditures of the Central Government in 1975 are expected
to amount to about Q60.0 million, or 16 percent of total Central Government
expenditures (4 percent of investment expenditures and 21.5 percent of
current expenditures). In terms of GDP share, the Q60.0 million would repre-
sent 2.1 percent, whereas during 1965-73 education's share of GDP never exceeded
1.9 percent. Government plans for expansion and improved quality (including
the proposed Bank project) are expected to require an increase in education
expenditures to 19.5 Dercent of Central Government expenditures by 1979 (6
percent of investment expenditures and 24 percent of current expenditures).
The growth in expenditures for primary and non-formal education would be
more rapid than those for secondary and higher education. The projected
increases would raise Central Government education expenditures by 0.4 percent
of GDP (from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent) which should be entirely feasible if
the Government continues the recent trend of placing higher priority on educa-
tion.



First Bank Education Project
32.       The first education loan,signed in 1968, provided US$6.3 million
for construction, furnishing, and equipping of 14 new secondary schools, a
secondary teacher training institution at the autonomous national university
(San Carlos), and expansion of facilities at the Agricultural Technical
Institute.  Project construction is complete and all schools are open. The
project was designed to help develop and expand pre-vocational education at
the secondary level, to provide qualified teachers in these areas, and to
improve and expand the supply of agricultural technicians. However, full
implementation of these goals, especially in training of practical subjects
teachers andin implementation of a pre-vocational curriculum at the upper
secondary level, was not achieved. Difficulties in teacher training were
caused by a lack of coordination between the Government and the San Carlos
University and by the fact that technical assistance provided by UNESCO
did not cover practical subjects, as originally planned. Difficulties in
curriculum reform were caused by insufficient cooperation between the pro-
project unit (located in the Ministry of Communications and Public Works)
and the Ministry of Education and lack of a permanent curriculum development
unit. The Government is anxious to correct these deficiencies. It has improved
lower secondary school curriculum and has set up committees to develop the
pre-vocational curriculum at the upper secondary level. It also has set
uD a curriculum department in the MtnistrnJ o Paucatinn ana is acting to
improve coordination between the project unit and other Government agencies.
PART IV - THIE PROJECT
33.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education Project, Guatemala"
(No. 926-GUa dated January 30,1)7T)   is being distiibuted separately.
The main features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III. Initial
sector work in connection with a proposed secondary and vocational education
project was carried out by a UNESCO mission in July 1972. In Auguist 1973
the Government decided to wi-thdraw the project from the Bank and to submit
it to the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for consideration.    The main
reason for this decision probably was the expec-ced availability of softer term
finance from the latter institution. IDB eventually advised -the Government
that it was not prepared to consider that part of the project which represented
a follow-on to the first Bank project, and the Government resubmitted the
secondary education component to the Bank.    In February 197', a Bank mission
visited Guatemala to discuss the project content and provide assistance to
the Secretariat of the Planning Council in project preparation. The project
was appraised by missions in April and August, 1975. Negotiations were held
in Washington from December 9 - IL  197K.   The Reoub2ic of Giiatemala was
represented by Mr. Guillermo Putzeys, Minister of Education, and Mr. J. Rohrmann,
Vice-Minister of Agriculture.



- 11 -
34.       The project is designed to assist the Government in implementing
more fully the educational improvements supported by the first project. Its
major objective, therefore, would be to enable the secondary education system
to provide students with a more practically oriented education and thus pro-
vide them with skills for further on-the-job training or further studies more
relevant to national development needs. In addition, the proposed agricultural
training schools would prepare technicians needed to upgrade agricultural
kno,wledge and skills in some of the most backward rural areas. Most project
schools would function as community training centers available for non-formal
training programs, and both first and second project schools would be assisted
through teacher and administrator training programs, and through technical
assistance to implement new curricula.
iements of the Project
(a) Lower Secondary Schools
35.       Eleven new lower secondary schools will be constructed, furnished
and equipped. In addition, three existing schools will be extended principally
through the addition of science laboratories and workshops for practical subjects.
All of the schools would be outside Guatemala City and five would be in the
priority central highlands area. At least nine of the schools would also function
as centers for non-formal education and training programs which would serve
the local community. At full capacity (two shifts), these schools would reach
over 10,000 students with the new practically oriented curriculum and would pro-
vide an annual output of about 3,000 students. The Government has agreed that
(i) the Ministry of Education would make at least nine of the schools freely
available to non-fornmal training agencies; and (ii) the detailed curriculum
for practical subjects to be taught in these schools would be submitted to the
Bank for review within one year of the signing of the Loan Agreement. (Sections
3.11(i) and 3.u0(ii) of the Loan Agreement.)
(b) Combined Upper and Lower-Secondary Schools
36.      Two new combined upper and lower secondary schools providing 1,800
student places will be constructed, furnished and equipped. One will be
located in Guatemala City and will replace existing inadequate facilities for
a lower secondary school and for the training of home economics, art and
physical education teachers for lower secondary schools. The second school
will be located in Antigua. In addition, an existing school in Flores will
be expanded, principally through the addition of a science   laboratory and
workshops for practical subjects, and will provide 240 student places. The
schools in Antigua and Flores would provide, in lieu of the traditional
teacher training courses, practical subject courses which are relevant to
the development needs of these areas. The school in Antigua would also serve
as a center for non-formal education and training for the local community.
Development of an appropriate pre-vocational curriculum would be a condition
of disbursement for construction, furnishing and equipping of the three schools.

(c)   Common Facilities Centers
37.        Two common facilities centers would be constructed, furnished and
equipped in Guatemala City. These centers would provide 1,120 student places
to serve up to 5,600 students on a multiple shift basis. The main purpose
of the centers would be to provide workshops for practical subjects and
laboratories for existing lower secondary schools with inadequate facilities
and to enable these schools to implement the new lower secondary school curricu-
lum. The utilization of these centers would permit significant economies
in initial investment per student and in operational costs through intensive
utilization of resources and facilities. The centers would also provide faci-
lities for organized non-formal education and training for out-of-school youths
and adults. The development of skills to manage these centers would enable the
Guatemalan Government to organize similar centers in other areas of Guatemala
City and in other cities and the larger towns. A coordinating committee to
include directors of feeder schools and representatives of participating non-
formal institutions would oversee their use.     The Government has agreed that
the Ministry of Education would make the centers freely available to non-
formal trainina agencies.  'Section 3.11 (iii) of the Toan Agreement.)
(d)    Agricultural Training Schools
Th.       Two new e-nerimental agricultural training schools will be cons-
tructed, furnished and equipped.   The schools will be located in the Western
.ighland and Y'orthern regions, and will have a capacity of 210 and 180 student
places respectively, including boarding facilities. Thirty of the 210 places
in the school to be located in the Western Highlands would be for non-formal
education and training. The main course would be designed to qualify about
120 students per year for positions as middle level technicians in Government
service, on farms, in farmer youth clubs and in the proposed non-formal edu-
cation and training activities.   As it would be intended that graduates provide
leadership in the development of improved agricultural techniques in some of
the most backward rural a_eas, the Government has agreed that new students
would be at least 13 years of age and, to the extent possible, would have
appropriate linguistic and socio-economic background.   The Government has
agreed that within six months of the signing of the Loan Agreement a council
to administer the agricultural training schools would be established and its
director appointed. (Sections 3.12 and 3.02(i) of the Loan Agreement.,
(e)   Additional Equipment and Teaching Materials
39.       Additional equipment will be provided for about two workshops each
to seven selected secondary schools which were constructed under the first
Bank project and which are going to implement the new pre-vocational curriculum
at the upper secondary level. The equipment now available in these schools
is sufficient only for lower secondary instruction. A condition to disbursement
for the additional equiprnent would be the development of an appropriate voca-
tional curriculum for the schools involved. In addition, about US$80,000 in
equipment will be provided to the Agricultural Technical Institute in Barcenas
to supplement equipiment rmade available under the first project, and to enable
the institute to assist in training agricultural teachers for the new agri-
cultural schools ana the lower secondary schools to be constructed under the
project. A condition of disbursement for this equipment would be the imple-
mentation of a program of in-service training and fellowships for teaching
staff.

(f) Training of Teachers and Administrative Staff
40.       The project will provide training for more than 600 teachers in
industrial arts, commerce, home economics and agriculture, and for about
100 directors, supervisors and coordinators of both first and second project
schools. The main purposes of the teacher training courses will be to help
develop a permanent institutional capacity in Guatemala for both pre- and
in-service training of teachers in vocational subjects and to insure the
proper use and maintenance of school equipment to be financed under the pro-
ject. The emphasis in training of administrators will be on efficient
management of school resources. The Government has agreed that: (i) Within
six months of the signing of the Loan Agreement, an operational plan would
be completed,for the teacher training to be supported by the proposed project,
including agreements with the participating institutions, which would be
acceptable to the Bank; and (ii) within one year of the signing of the Loan
Agreement, a more comprehensive long-term plan for developing a permanent
institutional capacity for training of teachers would be prepared and put into
effect.(Sections 3.08 (a) and (b), respectively, of the Loan Agreement.)
(g) Technical Assistance
41.       The project will include about 11 man-years of specialized services
and about 45 man-years of fellowships. Specialists services will include:
(a) an expert in teacher training and school management who would serve as
leader of the technical assistance mission (two and one half man-years); (b)
four specialists in commercial, agricultural, industrial, and home economics
education (four man-years); (c) two or more specialists to improve educational
management at both the local and national level (two man-years); (d) three short-
term specialists to help to improve and expand production of educational materials
and assist the procurement process (one and one-half man years); and (e) two
specialists to develop non-formal vocational programs and youth programs to be
conducted in the schools to be constructed (one man-vear). About 31 man-years
of fellowships would be provided to improve teacher training, 10 man-years to
improve educational management, planning, and curriculum development, and four
man-years to improve school administration.
(h) Studies
42.       The project would also include (1) preparation of a mapping survey
of the formal and non-formal educati-nal resources, (2) a study to establish
future priorities and develop an action program for further physical expansion
of the education system and for qualitative improvement in teaching, adminis-
tration and curriculum, and (3) assistance in establishing a tracer system to
tollow progress of graduates of project schools.

Cost and Financing
43.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$22.1 million,
of which US$11.0 million, or 50 percent, represents the foreign exchange costs.
The base costs are estimated in prices projected to the end of November, 1975.
Added to these base cost estimates are contingency allowances for (a) unfore-
seen physical expenses equal to 5 percent of base costs for equipment and
10 percent for all other items; and (b) price escalation equal to 24 percent of
the base price plus physical contingencies over the four years of project imple-
mentation. Total physical and price contingency allowances amount to US$5.8
million, or 36 percent of the US$16.3 million base cost estimate. With the
proposed loan amount of US$145 million, the Bank would finance 65 percent
of total project costs (US$11.0 million of foreign exchange and US$3.5 million
equivalent of local costs). The balance of the project costs will be borne
by the Government. The proposed amount of local currency financing is justified
for the reasons discussed in paragraph 10 above.
Project Entjty
44.       The existing project unit which was established within the Ministry
of Communications and Public Works performed satisfactorily in physical exe-
cution of the first project, but education aspects, especially teacher training
and curriculum reform,were rather neglected. In order to correct this deficiency,
the Government will restrict the project unit to the physical implementation of
the project and has created a new Department of Curriculum Development within the
Ministry of Education, whose responsibilities would include implementing the
educational aspects of the project. Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would
be (i) the appointment oI a director of the Department of Curriculum Development
who would be the coordinator between the project unit and the Ministry of Education,
and (ii) the appointment by the Ministry of Agriculture of a coordinator for the
agricultural education components of the project. The Government has agreed to
establish, within six months of the signing of the Lcan Agreement, technical review
committees with representatives from the Ministries of Education and Agriculture
and the project unit to analyze and review architectural designs, equipment and
furniture lists and specifications, and ascertain whether they meet economic and
functional standards and the educational objectives of each project institution.
(SectiorB5.01 (a) and (b) and 3.06 of the Loan Agreement, respectively.)

Procurement and Disbursement
45.        Contracts for civil works would be awarded on the basis of compe-
titive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures
acceptable to the Bank, but interested foreign firms would be permitted to
participate.  Contracts for procurement of furniture and equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Furniture and equipment that cannot be grouped in
packages of at least US$25,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive
bidding in accordance with the Borrower's regular procurement procedures
which are satisfactory to the Bank; procurement under this procedure would not,
in aggregate, exceed US$450,000 equivalent, or 10 percent of the total
cost oF f'urniture and equipment. In accordance with the Central American
Agreement on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Development, domestic and other
CACN member countries' manufacturers would receive a preferential margin of
15 percent of the c4i.f. base price or 50 percent of the tariff payable by
non-CAGM manuf'acturers, whichever is lower. The Project Unit would be responsible
fcr preparing and issuing tenders, evaluating bids and awarding contracts.
16.        The loan would be disbursed over a period of four years to meet:
(i) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for furniture and equipment and 85
percent of total costs of such f'urniture and equipment when procured locally;
(ii) 45 percent of the total costs of civil works; and (iii) 100 percent of
teacher and administrator training, technical assistance studies, and the
costs of key personnel Of the project unit.   An amount of up to US$300,000
would be disbursed retroactively for expenditures incurred after July 1, 1975,
for professional services, technical assistance and project administration.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Guatemala and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided f'or in Article III, Section I (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of' a draft resolution approving the
proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directos separately.

and (ii) the appointment by the Ministry ot' Agriculture of a coordinator for the
agricultural aspects of the project.
hR.        I am satisf'ied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
O0r Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Ln. 722         Livestock Project; US$4.o million of February 10, 1971;
Effective Date: July 19, 1971; Closing Date: December 31,1976.
Progress of this project has been slower than anticipated,
and it is likely that disbursements will not be completed
until about one year after the original closing date of
December 31, 1975. Operations improved somewhat when the
Bank and the Borrower (Government of Guatemala) agreed
to extend the project areato include the Central Northern
and Atlantic Coastal regions in addition to the Pacific
Coast, but a handicap is the lack of interest by banks
other than the Government-owned National Agricultural
Development Bank (BANDESA). The Government is considering
a series of measures suggested by the Bank to accelerate
commitments and disbursements.
Ln. 792         Telecommunications; US$16.0 million of January 5, 1972;
Effective Date: July 17, 1972; Closing Date: December 31,1976.
Initial delays, resulting from the consolidation of the
principal sector entities and lags in procurement will
delay completion of the project by about 21 months beyond
the original schedule. The project is now progressing
satisfactorily, and all contracts for the procurement of
goods have been signed.
Ln. 11o0        Telecommunications:  US$26.0 million Of April 29, 1975;
Effective Date: November  E 1975; ClosingDate: June 30, 1979.
This loan was declared effective on November 25, 1975.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in this seBe, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of the strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.
