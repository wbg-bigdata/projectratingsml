INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RFCONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECONVENDATION OF THE PRESIDFNT
TO TH.E EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ThIE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Swaziland for the equivalent of US$7.0 million to
help finance a second highway project. The loan would have a term of 23
years, including three years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2% per annum.
PART I - TE ECONOM1Y
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Memorandum on Recent
Economic Developments and Prospects of Swaziland" (AE-25), was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 1, 1972 (R72-91).    An updating economic
mission visited Swaziland in January/February 1975 and is expected to issue
its report shortly. The findings of the mission are summarized below.
Country data are summarized in Annex I.
3.        Swaziland, which became independent in 1968, is one of the smallest
countries on the African continent. Located in southern Africa, it is complete-
ly surrounded by the Republic of South Africa and Mozambique. In 1974 its
population was estimated at 498,000, of whom approximately 20,000 live abroad,
mainly as migrant workers in South Africa.    The country is well-endowed with
natural resources. It has a variety of mineral deposits, and its soil and
climate are favorable for a diversified agricultural production. Almost half
of the land is owned by foreigners, and foreign companies hold substantial
mining concessions. The 1950s and early 1960s saw a rapid development of
modern economic activities on foreign-owned land. Several mines (asbestos,
iron ore and coal) were opened up, and foreign companies established large
plantations (forestry, sugar, citrus, pineapple), which in turn gave rise to
industries, such as a pulp mill, saw mills, sugar mills, fruit processing
plants and various secondary industries. During this period, real GDP grew
at a rate of about 12% a year. Apart from tourism enterprises, no major new
industries have been established since independence, but expansion of existing
enterprises and the government sector, together with the establishment of a
number of smaller industries led to a well-sustained real growth in GDP of
about 7% a year between 1968 and 1974. Because of the improvement in the
terms-of-trade, real income grew even faster (9% a year). At current prices,
GNP per capita was estimated at about $450 in 1974.
4.        Swaziland's sustained economic growth has been a result of vigorous
private investment activity. Since independence, gross private investment
has averaged about 19% of GDP. Government capital expenditures were on the



- 2 -
average no more than 5% of GDP. These developments have led to a distinct
dualism in Swazi society and the economv. As Swazi entrepreneurship was,
and still is, virtually non-existent, all modern activities have been carried
out by foreign companies, under foreign management, and with foreign capital.
The foreign-otned modern sector now contributes about 70% of GDP, 80% of wage
employment and 90% of direct taxes. The traditional rural sector, which has
remained stagnant over the years, contributes no more than 14% of GDP. Because
of the sharp growth in wage employment in the modern sector, the relative
significance of the traditional rural sector, in terms of numbers of Deople
dependent on it, has declined. In 1960, 72% of the total labor force (men
and women) were available for work in the traditional sector. By 1973, this
percentage had decreased to 57.   Oving to the population growth, the labor
force in the traditional sector has nevertheless remained stable at about
110,000 persons (40,000 men and 70,000 women). In 1973, employment in the
modern sector was about 67,000 persons. Projections of the increase in wage
employment, based on likely trends in output and investment in the various
sectors, indicate that at least 30,000 new jobs will be created by 1980.
Most of the present labor force consists of unskilled workers, and there is
a serious shortage of skilled Swazis to work in the modern sector.
5.        Agriculture and forestry accounted for 36% of GDP in 1971/72 with
about 60% originating in the modern, foreign-owned sector. The majority of
this output came from estate production of cash crops such as sugar cane,
fruit and vegetables, for export after processing. In addition, a number of
large forestry plantations produced raws materials for saw mills and a pulp
mill. Approximately 40% of total wage employment in Swaziland is provided
by the modern agricultural sector. Some 80% of the total population live
in rural areas and have some land for grazing and the cultivation of crops.
Many men, however, commute to the centers of modern economic activity which
are all within easy reach.   Mining contributed about 7%. of GDP in 1971/72,
and manufacturing accounted for 13%1 of CDP.
6.        Together with Botswana, South Africa and Lesotho, Swaziland belongs
to the Southern Africa Customs Union. Swaziland receives a proportion of
the total customs and excise revenue of the whole customs area, related to
her total imports and production of taxable goods. Movement of goods and
funds within the area is virtually free. Swaziland and Lesotho are also
members with South Africa in the Rand Monetary Area. In September 1974,
Swaziland issued its owJn national currency, the emalangeni (E). The emalangeni
has the same par value as the rand and both currencies are legal tender in
Swaziland. The Government, with the assistance of the IMP, has established
a Monetary Authority to operate Swaziland's new financial system. In order
to remain in the Rand Monetary Area and be able to continue drawing on its
foreign exchange reserves, Swaziland has agreed to maintain 100% of the value
of the emalangeni in circulation in a rand account with the South African
Reserve Bank. This requirement and the free convertibility of the two cur-
rencies will restrict the Monetary Authority's control of the volume of
domestic credit.



7.        In 1969 the Customs Union Agreement among the four countries was
re-negotiated; this provided Swaziland with substantially increased revenues.
In addition, the strengthening of the tax administration and the introduction
of new taxes (hotel tax, sugar levy), have led to a steady increase in re-
current revenue from E8.5 million in 1967/68 to E29 million in 1973/74. At
the same time recurrent expenditures increased from E13 million in 1967/68
to E26 million in 1973/74. As a result, budget deficits (E4.5 million in
1967/68) turned into surpluses (E3 million in 1973/74). In future, budget
surpluses are expected to become even larger, and this should make it possible
for the Government to finance almost 50% of future public investment. To
complement the finance from domestic sources, new commitments of external aid
will be necessary in the medium-term, increasing from about E7 million in 1975
to E15 million in 1980. Part of the public sector investment program cannot
be translated into projects that would attract external financing. To provide
sufficient support for the investment program the external assistance agencies
should be prepared to finance about 75% of the cost of the projects they can
assist.
8.        Given Swaziland's membership in the Rand Monetary Area and thus its
access to the area's exchange reserves, the conventional analysis of foreign
exchange costs and balance of payments position are not of much practical
significance. Swaziland's exports increased from E39 million in 1968 to E73
million in 1973. At the same time, imports rose from E34 million to E68
million. As Swaziland sells most of its exports overseas, and imports from
South Africa account for about 90% of total imports, Swaziland is a substan-
tial net earner of foreign exchange for the Rand Monetary Area.
9.        Swaziland's National Development Plan (1973-77) emphasizes four
objectives: (1) to create the conditions for a sustained further growth of
the private sector; (2) to promote the transformation of traditional agri-
culture to commercial farming; (3) to improve the relevance and usefulness
of education; and (4) to provide better housing and health conditions for
low-income families in urban and rural areas. The Government realizes that
most of the momentum in the economy will come from the modern sector, and
much of Swaziland's development plan is geared to improving productive capa-
city of the country's modern economy. At the same time, a significant per-
centage of the population remains in traditional agriculture and will continue
in that activity through the next decade. The major constraints to the de-
velopment of traditional agriculture have been the cautious approach taken
by the Government and the general lack of planning and implementing personnel.
Recently, the Government indicated its intention to step up its programs
aimed at improving traditional agricultural productioA. The Ministry of
Agriculture has expanded its staff and a promising start is being made on
implementing several rural development programs.
10.       Until 1970 the United Kingdom provided funds to cover Swaziland's
budget deficits as well as grants and long-term interest-free loans for devel-
opment purposes. During the last few years, Swaziland has sought to diversify
its sources of foreign assistance. In addition to the UK, several bilateral
agencies have begun to make contributions to the financing of Swaziland's



-4-
capital budget. Because of the slow build up of absorptive capacity, the
utilization of foreign assistance has been sluggish. Recent experience
suggests that the country's absorptive capacity is improving, as the local
staff benefit from training and experience.
11.       On December 31, 1973, Swaziland's external public debt (including
undisbursed) stood at US$35 million. Service obligations on this debt
amounted to $4 million in 1974, which amount, however, included a $3 million
final repayment for the railway loan. In 1975, service payments on existing
debt will amount to only $1.7 million, just 1% of export earnings. Swaziland's
future external public debt (including undisbursed) is expected to increase
to some US$250 million by 1985 and annual debt service obligations to US$15
million, or 3% of exports. Since the Government is able to draw on the
foreign exchange earnings of the Rand Monetary Area, the debt service ratio
expressed as a percentage of exports is mainly an indication of what
Swaziland's external debt carrying capacity would be if the country withdrew
from the Rand Monetary Area. A more useful indicator of the Government's
current debt service capacity at present is the ratio of debt service payments
to government revenue. In 1974, servicing of existing public debt represented
4% of current government revenue; by 1985 we estimate this will have increased
to 6%.
12.       As a result of favorable export and public revenue prospects, Swazi-
land's ability to service debt on conventional terms has improved considerably
and the country is now considered creditworthy for Bank lending. We do not
at this time anticipate additional IDA lending to Swaziland.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SWAZILAND
13.       Of the five Bank Group operations in Swaziland to date, the first
three were before independence.   An IDA credit of $2.8 million, approved in
1962, helped finance the construction of the first highway project, an all-
weather road across the country; the construction was completed in 1964.
Thereafter, two loans (guaranteed by the UK) were made to assist the
Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB) in the development of the power sector.
The first, a $4.2 million loan made in 1963, enabled SEB to carry out the
Edwaleni hydroelectric project; the second, a $2.75 million loan in 1967,
financed the extension of the same project and the provision of an additional
diesel plant. All three loans are fully disbursed.
14.       We did not have any operations in Swaziland between 1968 and 1974.
The one major project we considered during that period, the Mapobeni Irriga-
tion Project, was determined to be uneconomic at appraisal. In recent years
we have intensified our preparatory work and, consequently, have presented
three projects for consideration in FY75. An IDA credit of $5.0 million was
made in December 1974 for an education project designed to strengthen
Swaziland's vocational, technical and commercial educational systems with
funds included for the phased development of a rural and adult education



-5-
program. A $3.5 million loan also was made in December 1974 to assist the
extension of water supply and sewerage facilities in the Mabane and Manzini
areas (Swaziland's only urban centers) and in the small toxn of Nhlangano.
Both projects have made promising starts. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits to Swaziland.
15.       In our proposed operations we are aiming to support the Govern-
ment's priorities as spelled out in the National Development Plan (see
para. 9). While assisting in the development of the modern sector, we will
also attempt to stimulate growth in the traditional rural sector which, de-
spite its diminishing size and importance, will continue to support a sig-
nificant percentage of the population. Preparatory work is underway on
several potential projects. We are attempting to identify a development
finance company project to help promote Swazi enterprise in the industrial
sector. In addition, we are in the early stages of identifying a rural
development project which would focus on improving livestock and crop pro-
duction through the introduction of grazing controls and conservation meth-
ods, and the provision of inputs such as credit and extension services.
16.       As a result of the substantial increase proposed in Bank
operations, debt to the Bank as a percentage of total debt is projected
to increase from 15.1% to about 21% in 1985. The Bank's share in total
external public debt service would increase from 16.2% at present to
about 34% in 1985.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
17.       As a small landlocked country, Swaziland depends upon its trans-
portation links with neighboring countries to conduct its international
trade. In the early 1960s, during the closing years of the colonial adminis-
tration, a vigorous road and railway building program was initiated to up-
grade Swaziland's inadequate transport facilities. The Government has con-
tinued this program and, in the last 15 years road length has increased by
close to 50% (with a five-fold increase in paved roads), a trans-territorial
rail line has been built, and air transport services begun. The Government's
Second National Development Plan (see para 9) emphasizes improvement of
the transport network based on a policy that has two broad aims: (1) to
aid development, particularly in rural areas, by improving transport services
and expanding the highway network in areas of high economic potential: and
(2) to reduce transport costs between Swaziland and neighboring countries.
Guided by this policy, government expenditure in the transport sector in
the 1973-1976 period is planned at E5.2 million, or 12% of total projected
public expenditures.



- 6 -
18.       The transport system of Swaziland reflects both the short travelling
distances within Swaziland and the dichotomy that has developed in the
economy's trading pattern. The majority of Swaziland's imports come from
South Africa and are brought in and distributed over the road network. The
passenger traffic and the locally-traded commodities are likewise carried
over the roads. Since most of the marketed production is exported overseas
(with little domestic consumption or processing of local products), it is
cheaper to haul exports over the longer distance to the port of Lourenco
Marques (Mozambique) by the railway. Thus, despite the importance of the
fairly intensive network of gravel and dirt roads to the economy, only 15% of
total freight traffic is carried by road transport while the majority (agri-
cultural and mineral exports) is carried by the single-track, non-passenger
railway. Air transport accounts for a small amount of passenger and mer-
chandise traffic using the international airport in Mbabane-Manzini area and
several dirt airstrips.
Roads
19.       Only 190 Ian of Swaziland's roads are paved, less than 10% of the
2,600 km road network. A number of higlhwav projects are under preparation
whichl, when completed, will more than double the total length of paved roads
in the countrv.  In addition, British ODM is financing some rural roads which
arc now under construction by force account. The largest segment of paved
road is a portion of Swaziland Trans-Territorial Highway which links up with
the South African road system in the west and Mozambique's in the east.
Engineering and paving of this road was undertaken under the first highway
project in 1962 (see para. 13). The road density equals approximately 5 km
per 1,000 inhabitants which is about the average of other countries at a
comparable stage of development. Due to inadequate maintenance, the gravelled
and dirt roads are of moderate to poor quality, and consequently, transport
costs are high. The vehlicle fleet in 1972 comprised 4,800 automobiles, 3,200
trucks and 300 buses, and was growing at a rate of 3.2% per annum.
Railway
20.       The railway was constructed between 1962-1964 to transport iron
ore from a nmine at Ka Dake, on Swaziland's western border, across the country
to Mozambique where it joined an existing rail line to Lourenco Marques.
The railway runs for 220 km., roughly paralleling the Swaziland Trans-
Territorial Highway except where the railwav makes a swing through the
agriculturally rich southern part of the country. The role of the railway
.n internal economic integration has been limited mainly because of the
l;ck of inter-regional trade within Swaziland (see para. 18), but also because
oC the lack of a link with the South African railway system.
21.       At present, the Swaziland Railwav is operated by the Mozambique
Railway unrler a contract which includes the provision of locomotives and
rolling stock. The railway construction was financed by short-term loans
that will be fully repaid by 1975. The Ka Dake mine's high grade iron ore



deposits are expected to be depleted by 1977, raising the question of continued
viability of the railway.    The railway also carries coal, sugar, wood pulp,
citrus fruits and other agricultural products to Lourenco J4arques and returns
with supplies, equipment and some petroleum imports, but three-fourths of the
railwav's traffic volume and most of its revenues come from the iron ore
traffic.  Although consultants are presently examining the future viability
of the railway, the Government has indicated its firm intention of maintaining
local operations and assuming control from the Mozambique Railway.     The follow-
ing options appear available to Swaziland regarding the railway but no clear
decision has emerged so far:    (i) find a purchaser for lower grade iron ore
or increase the beneficiation process on the lower grade deposits; (ii)
operate only the eastern section of the railway which passes through the
country 's fertile agricultural areas thereby reducing the railway's operating
costs: (iii) continue the railway's operation by initiating passenger services
and encouraging growth of commercial traffic (establishing passenger handling
facilities will require considerable additional investment).     The Government
has also explored the possibility of linking up with the South African Railway
and diverting import/export traffic from the road system, but projected cost
estimates do not justify the proposal at this time.
Transport Planning and Administration
22.       The Ministry of Works, Power and Communications (MWPC) controls
Swaziland's transport system through separate agencies responsible for the
road, rail and air transport network. Transportation planning is coordinated
by the Economic Planning Office (EPO), a branch of the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning. The EPO is responsible, through its selection of
projects, for implementing the Government's transport policy (see para 17).
To assist the EPO in transportation planning, the Government commissioned
the University of Natal in 1970 to conduct an overall transport study. Tnis
study was revised and updated in 1973, and has served as the principal basis
for the Government's transport development strategy.
23.        The Roads Branch of the I%PC has the executive responsibilitv for
planning, constructing and maintaining Swgaziland's roads. The Roads Branch
does not at present have the capacity to design or supervise the construction
of any roadworks beyond minor improvements. The Government is aware of the
need to strengthen the Roads Branch and has secured four engineers as part
of UK Government (ODM) assistance and is in the process of negotiating
Canadian (CIDA) assistance to build up the maintenance capability. The
Government has recentlv initiated a program to train local staff as engineers,
but for the next few years it will continue to depend on expatriate staff to
provide this expertise. In order to provide basic data for future transport
planning, the Government has agreed to improve its system of periodic traffic
counts (see Sec. 4.03 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
24.       The Roads Branch's maintenance performance has not kept pace w.ith
the expansion in Swaziland's road network.    Although the Poads Branch has
a bitumen unit, three gravelling units and tw-o bridoe construction and



-8-
repair units, only one of the three gravelling units is adequately staffed
and the bitumen unit is not operational. Two factors account for this
situation: (i) lack of trained road maintenance personnel; and (ii) the
inefficiency of the Government's Central Transport Organization (CTO) which
is responsible for maintaining and hiring out all public vehicles and mainte-
nance equipment. To improve this situation the Canadian Government (CIDA)
is 'nancing a study aimed at increasing the maintenance capacity of the
Roads Branch, and may finance a technical assistance program for the purpose.
The study will review the operations of the CTO and its relationship with
the Roads Branch, and its recommendations will be available shortly. The
Government has given assurances that a program will be agreed on for ensuring
the most economic and effective utilization of its road maintenance equipment
and vehicles (see Section 4.03(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).    The Government
has also agreed that sufficient funds will be allocated annuallv for highway
maintenance (see Section 4.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
25.       The 4MWPC regulates road use under the 1973 Road Traffic Law which
conforms to a similar law in South Africa. The regtulations provide strict
guidelines on size and weight of vellicles, axle and wheel loads and other
matters.  As road regulations are strictly enforced in Soutlh Africa, our
major concern is that the new regulations be also enforced within Swaziland,
particularly with respect to locally operating bulk sugar cane carriers.
The Government has agreed that it will ensure that the dimensions and axle-
loads of vehicles using its highway system are consistent with the structural
and geometric design standards of the roads (see Section 4.03(a) of the draft
Loan Agreement).
26.       Road users in Swaziland pay fees in several forms:    (i) vehicle
registration fees; (ii) an excise tax on fuel and lubricants; (iii) customs,
excise duties and sales taxes on motor vehicles and components. Pup, to
Swaziland's participation in the Soutlhern Africa Customs Union (see para. 6),
customs and sales duties on goods imported into the common customs area as
well as excise and sales duties on goods produced within the area are paid
into a central revenue pool. Each member receives a share of the pool
determined by a formula based on the level of imports into that country.
Consequently, vehicle license fees are the only road charges collected
directly by the Swaziland Government. While it is no longer possible to
trace total road user payments because Swaziland's share of the revenue pool
is not attributed by source, we believe they are more than adequate.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The proposed project is based on the transportation study con-
ducted by the Department of Economics, at the Universitv of Natal in South
Africa (see para 22). Consultants financed by UNDP and the Swaziland
Government, with the Bank acting as executing agency, completed detailed



- 9 -
engineering in mid-1974. A Bank mission appraised the proposed project in
August/September 1974. An Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of a Second
Highway Project, Swaziland" (Report No. 626-SW) is being circulated separately.
A loan and project summary is provided as Annex III. The proposed loan was
negotiated in Washington, D.C. in March 1975; the Government negotiating
team was led by  Mr. James Nxumalo, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning.
Description
28.       The proposed project consists of:
(a) improvement of the road between Tshaneni and Mlaula (about
39 km) to a two-lane bitumen paved standard; and
(b) improvement of the Helehele-Siphofaneni-Phuzumoya road
(about 43 km) to two-lane bitumen paved standard.
Both these roads were identified as priority roads in the University of Natal
study. Their improvement is consistent with the transportation policy of
the Second National Development Plan (see para 17). The Tshaneni-Mlaula road
passes through a rich agricultural region in the northern part of the country
where sugar cane and citrus fruit plantations predominate. The present road
has a rough gravel surface and is expensive to maintain under existing traffic
conditions. The second road is located in the central part of the country,
also an agricultural area, and branches off the main Trans-Territorial Highway
(paved under the first highway project, see para 13) at Helehele. Its con-
dition is poor, particularly in the rainy season when driving conditions become
dangerous.
Execution
29.       Although the Roads Branch in the MWPC will be responsible for the
execution of the project, consultants will be engaged for supervision of the
road improvement under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (see
Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). Improvement works will be under
one unit price contract, awarded after international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Prequalification of contractors will be
undertaken. There is no domestic contracting industry capable of executing
the project. Improvement is expected to take about two years.
Costs
30.       Total project costs are estimated at US$9.9 million equivalent
(including duties and taxes of US$500,000) with a foreign expenditure com-



- 10 -
ponent estimated at US$7.5 million (80% of net project costs). 1/ The US$7.0
million Bank loan would finance most of the foreign expenditure component of
the project or 74% of total project cost net of duties and taxes. The Govern-
ment will provide the balance from its own funds. The costs of improvement
were estimated by the engineering consultants in December 1974 on the basis
of final design quantities, and have been updated to March 1975. As no major
road construction work has been carried out in Swaziland for the past 10 years,
unit prices have been arrived at after a detailed survey of prices in the
adjoining South African provinces of Transvaal and Natal where an extensive
road construction program is underway. A 10% physical contingency has been
provided for construction and supervision to allow for possible quantity
variations and time extensions. A price contingency of 25% has been provided
to cover expected price increases during the project period.
Disbursement
31.       The proposed loan would be disbursed over three years.    Disbursement
would be made against the following expenditures:
(a) 70% of the total expenditures for civil works, and
(b) 100% of the foreign expenditures for consultants' services.
Justification
32.       The principal benefit from improving the Tshaneni-Mlaula and
Hlelehele-Phuzumoya roads would be lower vehicle operating costs. Both roads
provide important links to the national road system and the railroad, enabl-
ing the agricultural products of the nearby regions to be delivered to com-
mercial centers. The two roads pass through areas containing small- and
medium-sized Swazi farms as well as several foreign-owned plantations. The
area served by the Tshaneni-Mlaula road produces close to a million tons of
sugar cane annually, more than one-half of Swaziland's total cane production.
The cane is hauled by truck to a mill in Mhlume for processing after which
the sucrose and molasses are transported by truck to the railway station
at Mlaula. The mill and the large sugar cane estates are owned bv the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), a British Government development
institution which specializes in private sector operations. An increasing
number of Swazi smallholders also supply cane to the mill, in addition to
growing fruit, cotton, maize and potatoes.
1/   The term "foreign expenditure" means expenditures for goods and services
outside the country of the Borrower, thereby including expenditures in
South Africa, Lesotho and Botswana, even though these countries along
with Swaziland used the rand as legal tender.

33.       The traffic on the Helehele-Phuzumoya road will come from both
directions; the northern terminus of the road connects with the Trans-
Territorial Highway while the southeastern terminus crosses the railway
and is in the center of a cotton, maize, and vegetable producing area.
Traffic along this road includes several thousand tons per year of cotton,
produced by both a large number of Swazi smallholders and foreign-owned
farms. In addition, there is significant smallholder activity in other
food and cash crops within this region, and these smallholders are expected
to benefit from the road improvement.
34.       Traffic on the project roads is expected to grow by 7% per annum
over the 20 year life of the project. Savings in vehicle operating costs
and road maintenance costs are the principal quantifiable project benefits.
Since a portion of the traffic on both roads is related to the CDC-owned
sugar operations and other foreign-owned enterprises, we have deducted
benefits to these groups in order to calculate the project's economic rate of
return to Swaziland. Analyzed individually, the Tshaneni-Mlaula road shows
an economic return to Swaziland of 13% and the Helehele-Phuzumoya road yields
an economic return to Swaziland of 17%. After receiving expert advice and
the necessary technical assistance from the IMF, the Government introduced
a sugar levy in 1973, to share in the high profitability of the sugar industry.
ITnder the present formula used to calculate the levy, 50% of the savings in
the transport costs received by the CDC sugar operations would in effect be
transferred to the Government. The application of the levy depends on the
export price of sugar exceeding a minimum level which is based on production
costs. The Government has assured us of its intention of retaining the sugar
levy as it has become an increasingly important source of current revenue
(estimated at E20 million or about 40%'. of 1974/75 recurrent revenue). If
assumed it is that during the life of the project about half of CDC's
increased profits resulting from lower transport costs will be recovered
through the levy, our economic rate of return calculation gives a 20% return
to Swaziland on the Tshaneni-Mlaula road. The total benefits of the project
accruing to both Swaziland and the CDC/foreign-owned enterprises give an
economic rate of return of 28% for the Tshaneni-Mlaula road and 25% for the
Helehele-Phuzumoya road. Reasonable variations in projected traffic growth
and savings on vehicle operating costs cause only minor fluctuations in the
economic rates of return projections.

Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approv-
ing the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Certain distinctive features of the draft Loan Agreement, which
in general follows the usual pattern of loans for projects in the trans-
portation sector, are referred to in paragraphs 23, 24, 25 and 29 of this
Report.
