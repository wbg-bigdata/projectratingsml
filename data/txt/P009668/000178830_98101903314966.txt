APPRAISAL OF FIRST SHIPPING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The demand for petroleum products for fuel and energy has bqen
growing rapidly in India in recent years and is forecast to grow at an
even faster rate in the future. The Indian Fourth Plan (1969-74) provides
for increased refinery capacity and increased imports of refined petroleum
products to meet this .3emand. The shipping required to handle the imports
of crude and refined petroleum is well beyond the capacity of the Indian
tanker fleet and foreign carriers are currently handling 95% of import re-
quireoents. In order to reduce the foreign exchange cost of oil imports and
provide long-term assurances of reliable tran' ;port for a larger proportion
of oil import requirements, it would be desirable and economically justifi-
able to increase the Ir.dian flag tanker capacity.
ii.       This report appraises a project which would provide ships to:
(a) meet the crude oil requirements of refineries at Haldia
and Barauni; and
(b) partially meet the requirements for the import, export
and to a limited extent, the coastal movement of petroleum
products.
The project makes provision for the purchase of:
-    Four crude oil tankers each of 80,000 deadweight tons (dwt)
class;
-    Two oil products tankers, each of the 20,000 dwt class.
In addition, the Government will arrange for the provision of pollution con-
trol equipment at certain ports and a crude oil transfer vessel.
The Association would provide the foreign exchange required to purchase the
tankers at a cost of US$83 million equivalent. The Government would provide
transfer vessel(s) and the pollution control equipment associated with the
project at a cost in rupees equivalent to US$2 million. The credit would be
the first major Bank Group lending for oceangoing ships in recent years, al-
though shipping has been financed through the Development Finance Companies
Department, and included as A small portion of some port and highways loans
(e.g. dredgers and ferries).
iii.      The Government, acting through the Shipping Development Fund Com-
mittee (SDFC), would loon the proceeds of the credit funds to the Shipping
Corporation of India (SCI) at .8-/2% p.s. to be repaid within 17 years. SCI
would own the ships and time-charter them to the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)
for 16 years. The charter end a mortgage would secure the loan and provide
the revenue to service the debt. The loan, the charter, and the mortgage



- ii -
would be denominated in rupees of constant value, in order to pass on the
exchange risk to the ultimate beneficiary. Disbursement of the credit would
follow agreed procedures related to the terms of a shipbuilding contract.
This contract would result from international bidding which has already been
undertaken in accordance with Association practices.
iv.        SDFC is experienced in making and administering shipping loans.
By mid-1971 it had disbursed over US$200 million equivalent. In the case of
the proposed credit, SDFC will amend its usual lending documents to reflect
the Association's requirements. SCI, the proposed recipient of the loan,
is a well-managed, expanding shipping company owning over one million dwt
of shipping. IOC, the proposed charterer, markets about half of the oil
products sold within India. It is financially sound and can readily accept
the charter obligations involved.
v.         Technical specifications for the ships incorporate the highest
safety standards, pollution control devices and comply with all current major
international conventions dealing with shipping. Construction of the ships
wrould be supervised by representatives of internationally recognized ship
classification societies 1/ acceptable to the Association. Engineering and
design would be carried out by the successful shipyards. The Government
would be asked to undertake further studies of certain aspects of shipping
operations, such as barging coastal oil products for distribution to terminals.
vi.        The financial rate of return for the project would be around 12%
on the investment in crude oil and products tankers, before taxes. The eco-
nomic analysis indicates that the project would have a rate of return of
about 12%.
vii.       Agreement on a number of points referred to in Chapter 7, below,
has been reached during negotiations. The project would be suitable for a
credit of US$83 million equivalent.
1/    A group of independent naval architects and engineers whose established
regulations for ship construction and maintenance are internationally
recognized for insurance and safety purposes. Lloyd's Register of
Shipping and American Bureau of Shipping would be the two societies
involved in inspecting the proposed ships.



INDIA
APPRAISAL OF FIRST SHIPPING PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested the Association to
assist in financing a project consisting of: (i) the purchase of four crude
oil tankers required to supply new refinery facilities at Haldia on the
Hooghly River, below Calcutta, and at Barauni; (ii) the purchase of two oil
products tankers to carry imports, exports and coastal movements of refined
petroleum. The total cost would be US$83 million all in foreign exchange to
be provided by the proposed credit and expended upon the six tankers. The
Government has agreed to provide promptly pollution control equipment and
crude oil transfer vessel(s), the approximate value of which is Rs. 131.0
lakhs (about US$2.0 million).
1.02      The Government would provide the ships through the Shipping De-
velopment Fund Committee to the Shipping Corporation of India through a 17
year 8-1/2% loan from SDFC payable in constant value rupees. They would be
chartered to the Indian Oil Corporation for the period of the loan for use
in trades essential to the Indian economy. SDFC is the major source of ship
finance in India, while IOC and SCI are, respectively, the largest oil and
shipping companies in India. The Association would utilize SDFC facilities
for rupee financing procedures and loan administration, much in the manner
that a Development Finance Company (DFC) is utilized.
1.03      The proposed project derives from an October 1970 GOI memorandum
relating to the need for assistance in expanding the Indian merchant fleet.
Subsequent discussions between India and the Association have identified a
specific need in the petroleum sector. This would be the first major Bank
Group credit for ocean-going ships since the post-war reconstruction period
although dredgers, tugs and harbor craft have been included in several previ-
ous loans. Bank financed Development Finance Companies in India, Philippines,
and Korea have financed ships in the recent past.
1.04      Bank Group lending to India's transport sector has been directed
primarily towards railways; no loans have yet been made to India's petroleum
sector. Since 1949 there have been six loans and four credits for railways
totalling US$631 million equivalent; nine operations have been satisfactorily
completed. The most recent, Credit 162-IN, was made in 1969 for US$55 mil-
lion equivalent and has been fully disbursed. There have been three loans
and one credit for the Indian ports of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras - a total
of US$82 million equivalent. The loans to Calcutta and Madras were satisfac-
torily completed. The undisbursed balance of US$1.2 million equivalent of
the loan to Bombay was canceled in August 1970, after those elements of the
project requiring foreign exchange had been completed. The local expendi-
ture features of the Bombay project will be completed by December 1971. A
loan for civil aviation (US$5.6 million equivalent) and a credit for roads
(IJS$60 million equivalent) have also been made. Commercial vehicle com-
ponents were financed as part of six industrial import credits made between
1964 and 1970. An eleventh railway project is currently being negotiated.

1.05      An appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. Bain (Port Specialist
and head of mrission), Burns (Financial Analyst), Roberts (Economist),
Skrastin and Professor Frankel (Consultants) visited India in July 1971.
Professor Nawacki and Mr. Swift (Consultants) and A/S Shipping Consultants
(Norway) undertook preparatory studies for the Association.
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Petroleum Demand and Import Requirements
2.01      Total energy consumption in India is estimated to have grown at
about 5% per annum over the period 1961-69. Reflecting the industrializa-
tion of the Indian economy, consumption of commercial forms of energy has
increased at nearly triple the rate of non-commercial forms, such as wood
and dung. Petroleum and hydro power, with growth rates of about 13% per
annum over the period 1961-69 have been substantially more dynamic than the
other forms of commercial energy. As a result of these differential growth
rates the percentage contribution of petroleum to total energy consumption
has risen from about 16% in 1961 to about 24% in 1969, while that of coal
has remained static at about 20% and that of non-commercial energy has fallen
from about 60% in 1961 to about 52% in 1969. The Indian Fourth Plan (1969-74)
assumed that, in the absence of Government action to change them, these trends
would continue throughout the Plan period, giving petroleum a 31% share of the
energy market in 1974.
2.02      The growing demand has been, and will continue to be, met partly
by increasing refinery capacity and partly by increasing imports of refined
products. India is, however, becoming progressively more dependent on crude
oil imports. It produces at present only about one-third of its crude oil
requirements or 7 million out of the 18 million tons required in 1970. The
Assam and Gujerat areas produced 3 million and 4 million tons respectively
in that year. None of the fields is prolific and total reserves are cur-
rently estimated at 140 million tons - equal to a 20-year life. Reserves
have been steadily expanded and production growth has kept pace with the
increase in demand. However, in absolute terms, there has been a large
increase in crude oil import requirements, from 6 million tons in 1961 to
11 million in 1970.
2.03      In consequence, the cost of crude oil imports, excluding freight,
rose from US$50 million in 1961 to US$120 million in 1969. The 1969 freight
bill was US$28 million, nearly 90% of which was in foreign exchange. Since
the Government estimates 1975 crude oil import requirements at about 18 mil-
lion tons the cost in that year, based on Persian Gulf crude oil price in-
creases negotiated in 1971, will be about US$330 million, exclusive of freight
costs.
2.04      In view of the substantial impact of crude oil import costs on
India's balance of payments, GOI is studying the feasibility of diverting
more of the growth in energy demand towards domestically produced fuels. In



-3-
addition, GOI intends to reduce, so far as possible, the foreign exchange
element of freight on crude and refined oil imports. The proposed project
will assist in this aim by reducing the foreign exchange component of the
freight bill by about US$11 million annually.
2.05      Present annual refining capacity totals about 20 million tons.
Refineries under construction or planned will add a further 11 million tons
annually by 1976. GOI's policy calls for the widest feasible geographic
dispersion of refining capacity in order to minimize distribution costs of
refined products and to spread associated employment opportunities. In
furthering this policy, refineries were built at Gauhati (1962), Barauni
(1964), Koyali (1965), Cochin (1966) and Madras (1969) while expansion of
the established Bombay refineries has been restricted (Map 1).
2.06      The newest elements in this policy are a refinery now under con-
struction at Haldia on the Hooghly River estuary, and a million ton addition
to the Barauni refinery. Both will utilize imported crude oil. The Haldia
refinery will go on stream in 1973 and reach a crude oil capacity of 2.5
million tons per year in 1974 rising to 3.5 million tons annually in 1977.
The Barauni expansion will require one million tons of imported oil per
year in 1974 and two million tons in 1975 when part of the refinery's pre-
sent flow of Assam oil will be diverted to another new refinery at Bongai-
gaon. Thus the combined import requirements of Haldia and Barauni, both of
which will be served through an oil jetty at Haldia, will be 3.5 million
tons of crude oil in 1974 and 4.7 million tons in 1975 or about 25% of total
national crude oil import requirements.
B.   Tanker Fleet Capacity
2.07      In 1971 the Indian merchant marine totalled 250 ships of 2.4 mil-
lion GRT (Table 3). The tanker element was limited to 21 vessels of 547,185
GRT (28% of the fleet) consisting of 11 oil tankers and 10 ore/oil ships
capable of handling crude or fuel oil in combination with grain, coal or iron
ore. Only 5% of India's crude oil requirements are carried in Indian ships,
in contrast to about 40% of general cargo imports and exports.
2.08      Of the 11 oil tankers in operation (Table 4), four are small coast-
al oil products tankers ranging in size from 11,000 to 16,000 dwt and seven
are crude oil tankers. The coastal tankers are nearly obsolete and have poor
service reliability. They are to be replaced in 1974 and 1975 by three new
products tankers each of about 16,000 dwt, acquired under bilateral arrange-
ments with the USSR. These ships, temporarily supplemented by two ore/oil
carriers each of 21,000 dwt in refined oil service, make up the Indian coast-
al tanker fleet. Several foreign ships are on charter to meet the remaining
demand for coastal oil product movements.
2.09      Of the existing fleet of seven crude oil tankers the two largest
are currently on charter to foreign oil companies. When the charters expire
in 1972, these two tankers of 87,600 dwt each will be utilized to carry
crude oil to the Cochin refinery. The five remaining tankers, ranging in
size from 33,000 dwt to 59,000 dwt, supplemented from time to time by eight



-4-
ore/oil carriers, currently make up the existing Indian overseas oil fleet.
Total capacity for crude oil movements is therefore quite restricted and far
below the current and anticipated requirement of the Indian oil refineries.
The capacity for refined oil products, other than that which can be carried
in ore/oil ships, is negligible. India must therefore now rely heavily on
the use of foreign flag carriers for both crude oil and oil products.
2.10      Currently there are 58 ships on order by Indian shipping companies
(Table 5); of these, five are tankers (the three coastal tankers mentioned
in para. 2.08 above and two, of 87,600 dwt each, which will be used to carry
oil to the Madras refinery). The proposed project would provide four addi-
tional crude oil tankers of about 87,500 dwt each for the specific purpose
of serving the needs of the Haldia and Barauni refineries commencing in 1974
(see para. 2.06). It would also provide two 24,000 dwt oil product tankers
to fill the need for import and export capacity as well as limited coastal
movements.
2.11      The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), a publicly-owned, auto-
nomous company, dominates Indian tanker operations. It is the largest of
the 37 registered Indian shipping companies, operating 50% of India's GRT
and 40% of the ships in operation. It owns nine of the 11 tankers in opera-
tion; the five new ones on order; six of the 10 ore/oil ships currently op-
erating and the two on order. The vessels to be provided under this proposed
project would be owned by SCI.
C.   Coastal Oil Movements and Inter-Modal Planning
2.12      With the demand for oil products rising rapidly throughout India,
constant improvements in the nationwide distribution system will be needed.
The long coastline, providing connections between many important centers
offers considerable scope for low-cost bulk movements by water in addition
to the one to two million tons of oil products which currently move by
coastal tankers. As stated above, however, only a few Indian tankers are
available for this trade and they must be supplemented by foreign ships or
by ore/oil carriers pressed into service on a temporary basis.
2.13      It is probable that the scope for coastal services could be con-
siderably enlarged, not only by the provision of additional tankers on these
services, but also by the eventual introduction of new innovations such as
the use of push-tugs and barges which have been demonstrated to have ad-
vantages over the use of ships, particularly for smaller-volume, short-haul
operations. Since the use of barges on the open sea is a relatively new de-
velopment requiring advanced technology, the system does not appear appro-
priate for immediate implementation. However, in view of its potential not
only as a supplement to or replacement for coastal tanker movements, but also
as an economical alternative to increased rail and road transport, GOI in
cooperation with IOC has agreed to undertake a detailed study of tthe use of
tugs and barges in the secondary distribution of oil products.



2. 14     Such a study, undertaken in isolation, wculd n"t give proper
weight to the complexities of inter-modal relationships. This reflects a
c'irrent weakness in the Indian transport planning mechanismii which provides
for little coordination of modal planning done at various levels within a
number of agencies.  There is no provision for the plaznning and management
of the transport sector as a whole in the Central Coavernpient. As a result,
governmental action, which is fundamental in any trans,port :;ystem, falls
unequally on the various modes.  This problem has bse'mn 'l.7cussed at length
with the Indian authorities during negotiations i,iit. tori.rlet-Pd for an eleventh
railway project and the Government has agreed to undertaKe a review of recent
progress with respect to investment plannine and rationalization of pricing
and regulatory policies. This review, in which the Bank Group would partic-
ipate by means of a comprehensive sector review nission scheduled for February
1973, would emphasize the need for better coordination and effective institu-
tions to achieve policy objectives. The Indian authorities would carry out
the review with a view to agreeing with the Bank on a framework for future
Bank group activities in the sector.
3. ORGANIZATIONS INWOLV D
3.01      The proposed credit to the Government would be lent to SCI through
the agency of the SDFC. The ships purchased by the proceeds of this credit
will be chartered to the Indian Oil Corporation for 16 years.
A.   Shipping Development Fund Committee
3.02      The Shipping Development Fund was established in 1958 as a statu-
tory fund under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (relevant
sections are given in Annex 2) to provide long-term assistance to the na-
tional shipping industry. The Fund provides a continuous source of finance
for ship acquisition. Finance for the Fund comes mainly from Central Gov-
erment grants and loans and partly from repayment of existing loans.
3.03      The Fund is administered by a Committee consisting of a chairman
and up to six members appointed by the Central Government. These members
are drawn from the Ministries of Shipping and Transport, Finance and Law
and include the Government Director on the Boards of Indian shipping com-
panies. The Committee is a body corporate having perpetual succession and
a common seal, with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property, and to
sue and be sued.
3.04      SDFC is the Government channel through which loans are provided
for the acquisition of ships. From its inception in 1958 until the middle
of 1971 it had disbursed US$200 million equivalent in loans (Table 6) and
there have been no cases of default during that period. It is thoroughly
competent and experienced in making and administering loans. The content
and form of loan agreements, mortgage deeds and covenants are entirely ade-
quate and impose stringent conditions and controls to preserve the security
of the loans. The special conditions required by the Association could,



-6-
without difficulty, be incorporated in these documents.  By using SDFC as the
lending agency, the administration of the loan to be granted from the proposed
credit would be simplified. The Association would be relieved of much of the
detailed preparation and supervision which would otherwise be necessary. Under
the project agreement the Association would share the right SDFC holds under
its loan agreement with respect to information about the ship and its owner.
SDFC would be reimbursed for these services by a 1% spread between the lend-
ing to SCI and the rate which it must pay to GOI.
B.   The Shipping Corporation of India
3.05      SCI was formed in 1961 when the Western and Eastern Shipping Cor-
porations were merged by virtue of the Shipping Corporation Amalgamation Order,
1961. SCI is a state-owned but autonomous body managed by a Government-
appointed Board of Directors. Annex 3 details SCI's corporate history and
pattern of development.
3.06      SCI, the largest Indian shipping company, operates general cargo
and passenger services and is also active in the bulk dry cargo and tanker
markets. Its fleet has grown from 20 vessels of 203,000 dwt in 1962 to 78
vessels of 1.4 million dwt in June 1971 and it currently has 29 vessels
totalling over one million dwt on order representing a total investment of
some Rs 18,000 lakhs (US$240 million).
3.07      The Jayanti Shipping Company Ltd., managed by SCI since June 1966,
became a wholly owned subsidiary of SCI on October 17, 1971, as a result of
an Ordinance promulgated by the President of India on that date. The Cor-
porations fleet was, thereby, increased by 17 to 95 vessels of 1.51 million
dwt (approximately 50% of the current total Indian deadweight tonnage). The
Jayanti Company has specialized in tramping operations.
3.08      SCI is well managed and compares favorably in operation with many
shipping companies in developed countries. New methods and techniques are
gradually being introduced which should improve managerial and technical ef-
ficiency still further. An adequate supply of merchant seamen and officers
will be available through the training facilities provided by the six mari-
time training establishments in India. The Corporation would be able to
efficiently manage and operate the vessels being considered for purchase
under the proposed credit.
C.   The Indian Oil Corporation
3.09      The Corporation is wholly owned by GOI and managed by a Govern-
ment-appointed Board of Directors. It came into existence on September 1,
1964, as a result of a merger of two public sector undertakings - the Indian
Refineries Ltd., and the Indian Oil Co. Ltd. - as GOI wished to secure ef-
fective coordination and control of refining and marketing activities. It
operates through its two major divisions: (i) refining, which has included
the pipelines division since February 1968 and (ii) marketing. It is the
largest refining and marketing oil company in India with sales of nearly nine



million tons in 1970, 52% of the market. Sales have grown at a compound rate
of 29% per annum over the period 1966 to 1970 and continued rapid growth is
expected for some years.
3.10      IOC owns and operates refineries at Koyali, Gauhati and Barauni,
with a total rated capacity of 6.65 million tons. It will also own and
operate the refinery at Haldia.
3.11      The marketing division is responsible for sales of petroleum pro-
ducts produced by its own refineries and sales of imported refined products.
It also handles the marketing of products from the Cochin and Madras refin-
eries in which GOI has a majority interest of 52% and 74% respectively. It
controls distribution of these products through four branches in Bombay,
Madras, New Delhi and Calcutta. In 1970, IOC handled imports of over one
million tons of refined products and exports of 400,000 tons. Coastal tanker
movements by IOC amounted to about 1.1 million tons in 1970. At present, IOC
lacks a formal marine department and the Planning, Research and Statistics
Department performs these function on an ad hoc basis which may partly ex-
plain the conservative scheduling and poor turnaround rerformance of coastal
tankers. A marine department will be established by InC by December 31, 1972.
It will schedule tankers and study ways and means of improving their turn-
around.
3.12      IOC would charter the vessels being considered under the proposed
project from SCI for a period of 16 years from the delivery of each ship.
The term and the formula for the cost of the charter have been agreed and
approved by the Association. The financial obligations arising from these
time charter contracts are small in relation to overall commitments amount-
ing to around 2% of total operational expenditure at 1970 levels.
4. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project forms part of the Indian Fourth Plan (1969-
74) investment program to increase oil refinery capacity and, at the same
time, provide appropriate tanker capacity. The project tankers will be
used to import and distribute oil products to meet part of the growing
demand for fuel and energy. The project would consist of the following
elements:
(a)  the purchase of four crude oil tankers each of 87,500
dwt, for the import of crude oil to meet part of the
requirements of the Haldia and Barauni refineries;
(b)  the purchase of two refined oil product tankers each
of about 24,000 dwt, for the import, export and the
coastal distribution of refined petroleum products.
These ships are designed to operate with 71,500 dwt at 39 feet draft and
19,500 dwt at 30 feet draft, respectively.



-8-
A.   Crude WlI Tankers
4.02      The crude oil tankers would be operated between Persian Gulf oil
ports and the laldia oil jetty on the Hooghly River Estuary (see Map 2). The
four shipm would have an economic operational life of about 20 years and could
be maintained and repaired in India.
4.03      Responses to bids indicate that all ships could be delivered in
series during 1974. The project ships can meet refinery demand for crude
oil shortly after the refineries come on stream in 1973. Some recourse to
the short term (spot) charter market may have to be made after 1976 depend-
ing on the rate of refinery expansion.
4.04      Studies by Association consultants, based on anticipated volumes
of oil to be moved, available drafts in the approaches to Haldia, alongside
depths at the Haldia oil jetty, refinery oil storage facilities, and other
pertinent factors indicate that a ship delivering approximately 1,000,000
tons of oil per year would be most suitable. Studies of other alternatives
(Annexes 4, and 5) confirm that this size is both economically and financially
close to the optimum.
4.05      The choice of ship size assumes completion of on-going dredging
and realignment works in the Hooghly River estuary to provide and maintain
adequate depths of water for large ships. By 1975, minimum depths in the
approach channel and at the Haldia oil jetty will permit ships drawing 36
ft to lie alongside. By 1980, dredging will increase these depths suffi-
ciently to allow ships drawing 40 ft to sail up the channel and to lie along-
side at lowest low water. Completion of the Farakka Barrage may yield another
two to three feet draft. All of the works in the Hooghly estuary are the
responsibility of the Commissioners for the Port of Calcutta (CPC) who have
commissioned studies of whether the improvement of the Haldia oil jetty is
necessary to berth the project tankers. Work on estuary training and dredg-
ing is underway and CPC have ordered a new dredger for delivery in 1974.
Assurances have been obtained that all of the work necessary for the success-
ful operation of the tankers to the Haldia terminal will be completed as
scheduled.
B.   Transfer Vessels
4.06      Until the Hooghly estuary channel is deepened to its full poten-
tial in 1980, the crude oil tankers would have to be substantially lightened
in order to cross the bars and lie alongside the oil jetty. This may be a
more economical approach than operating them with a light load throughout
the entire journey from the Persian Gulf oil ports. During the first five
or six years of the project, the oil tankers would have to be lightened on
each trip. Thereafter, it may be cheaper to navigate with cargo holds near-
ly full and sail direct to the terminal than to delay the ships and maintain
transfer vessels for only a small cargo on each trip.



- 9 -
4-07      The lightening operation would be similar to that currently carried
out for grain movements in this same area and is technically feasible. Indian
authorities are not familiar with the transfer of oil at sea but SCI, CPC and
TOC have been asked to review the technique through observation of transfer
operations in order to be assured that the method is srTeedY, practical and
safe. During negotiations, GOI has agreed to the use of transfer vessel(s)
and to the provision of such vessel(s) at SCI expense 7.-rlnr to the delivery
of the first crude oil tanker.
4.n8      The transfer could be effected bv new self-pro5-clled barges confined
to estuary operations or, alternatively, refurbished small products tankers
similar to those currently being replaced on coastal services. The equiva-
lent of about 16,000 dwt would be required initiallv. In either case, the
vessel(s) could be constructed or refurnished in Indian shiryards at a cost
of about Rs. 94.6 lakh (about US$1.3 million). The capital cost and estimated
operating expenses have been included in the estimates of the delivered price
of oil given in Annex 5.
C.   Petroleum Products Tankers
4.09      Tankers of this type are involved in the import of naptha, gasoline
and other oil products, as well as their distribution from refinery to other
coastal and foreign port facilities. A tanker operating at 19,500 dwt with
a draft of 30 ft is the maximum possible for these operations as such a ship
could utilize every Indian port with the exception of Okha which will be
served by the smaller products tankers now on order. In some ports the prod-
uct tankers could utilize their full draft and deadweivht of 24,000 tons.
Products tankers are relatively expensive because of the elaborate internal
fittings required to permit the simultaneous handling of several types of
products. Their economic life is limited to 12-16 years due to the corrosive
effects of their products and the sea-water which must be used as ballast
under certain conditions. The chartering of such shins is difficult since
most are owned and operated by oil companies on their r,wn services.
4.10      In order fully to realize the benefits of these larger more modern
ships, pipe sizes from the water's edge to storage tanks would have to be in-
creased and shore pumping facilities modernized. Provision for night naviga-
tion in some harbors would also be necessary. Agreement has been reached dur-
ing negotiations that the required improvements would be made prior to the
delivery of the ships. The required expenditures would he small, entirely
in rupees, and would be included in the regular annu'l improvement program
by the Ministry of Shipping and Transport and IOG.
D.   Pollution Considerations
4.11      As crude oil tankers would be discharging oil at Haldia and taking
on water ballast, no discharge of oil slops would occur. The specifications
of the ships to be purchased by the credit include provision for the most
modern oily water treatment and collection facilities. Agreement has been
obtained that the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organizations'



- 10 -
(IMCO) recommended operational procedures would be used aboard ships to re-
duce or eliminate the discharge of oil into the sea. Facilities exist at
some Persian Gulf loading ports for the reception of oily wastes. Adequate
standards or sewage treatment are included in ship specifications.
4.12      Product carriers which load and unload around India's coasts
require oily water collection and separation systems ashore, as voyage
times are too short to permit efficient separation at sea. These facili-
ties are required at major loading points. Except for Cochin such instal-
lations exist or are under construction at all major refineries, including
Haldia. Agreement has been reached that the required facilities would be
built at Cochin.
4.13      The cost of improving oil product terminal facilities and of
providing oil waste treatment at Cochin is a small portion of project cost.
It is not likely to exceed Rs. 36.4 lakhs or about US$500,000 equivalent.
The improvements of Haldia are underway and will, in any event, be completed
prior to deliveries of the project tankers.
E.   Project Costs
4.14      The cost estimates for the project are based upon fixed price
quotations received by SCI for crude oil tankers and for product carriers.
Estimates of Indian costs involved were obtained from discussions with
Indian shipyards. The total project cost would be:
Rupees (Lakhs)                 US$ Million

il   Di.sbursements (Annex 6)
A.15      The tenders call for about 20% of the tntal nojP.'t cost to be
r'td within six months of signing shipbuilding contracts w- th two shipyards.
risb:'rsements thereafter are related to constructioi' Lra! .elivery.  Disburse-
ments wi]l be completed in December 1974, when the sh1rs are 3elivered.
4.16      Bidding procedures for the ships have been cakri-.d oit by SCI in
a manner consistent with Association procedures.  T'J-   151qi4Oiries were sent
to 28 shipyards in 11 countries for crude tankers and to ?E ahiovards in 10
countries for product tankers. Inquiries were also s'ont to 11 sale and pur-
ciiase brokers with international representation. Repl_es were received from
five shipyards for crude tankers and from five shipyardq tor rroduct tankers.
One shipyard bid for both types of ships.  Bids were e-scluated according to
criteria provided to bidders, who were asked also to estimate thie actual costs
of any escalation. SCI organized a technical committee Lo evaluate all bids.
The Association has reviewed this evaluation ant1 has agir-ed tc iCI beginning
detailed contract negotiations with two shipyardz so that an award may be made
if the credit is approved.
4.17      The final shipbuilding contract and th" loor. a'.reement to be signed
between SDFC and SCI will contain arrangements satistactory tc the Association
for the protection and security of advances and of work in progress. These
clauses will be approved by the Association prior to contract signing. The
detailed contract documents will be subject to Association approval.
G.   Project Execution and Organization
4.18       During the period of ship construction representatives of the
classification societies under whose rules the ships are to be built, of the
shipowner, and of the Government, would be in attendance, as is usual. In
addition, SDFC and the Association would have the right to inspect the ship
during construction.
4.19      The Association would have rights with respect to:  (i) inspection
during the construction of ships to be built under thp credit; and (ii) re-
ports on company operations from the shipowner during the period in whIch the
sub-loan is outstanding. The proposed Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and SDFC and SCI deals with the sub-loan conditions, ship mortgage and
covenants, and the protection of Association-financed Rd-.&ances under the
shipbuilding contract.
4.20      As the agreed sub-loan agreement, mortgagc, and covenants are satis-
factory to the Association and as the ships are to be maintained to the stand-
ards of a major classification society, it is not considered necessary that
Association representatives physically inspect the ships after delivery dur-
ing the proposed 17-year loan period. The effect of the SDFC mortgage and
loan will be to isolate the ships from SCI's other assets. TPnder the pro-
posed Project Agreement the Association and SDFC will have adequate remedies
against default or poor management. The power to obtain direct payment of



- 12 -
the time charter revenues and the power to appoint new managers for the ship
are acquired by SDFC and the Project Agreement requires SDFC to exercise its
rights in the interests of the Association.
4.21      The foreign exchange arising from the credit would be paid to the
shipyards according to the terms of the shipbuilding contracts. The rupee
funds to acquire this foreign exchange would be lent to SDFC by the Govern-
ment and on-lent by SDFC to SCI.  A loan agreement satisfactory to the Asso-
ciation would govern the repayment of rupees by SCI to SDFC. A maintenance
of value clause will be included so that the exchange risk during the life
of the ship loan and charter period is borne by SCI and passed on to IOC.
Repayment by SDFC to the Government will be on the same terms as the loan
from SDFC to SCI, except that the interest rate will be 1% less. This pro-
vides a fee for SDFC's administration of the loan over its life.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The proposed tankers would provide necessary transport services
with a substantial saving of foreign exchange. The economic benefits of
the project are based on a comparison of the costs to India of owning and
of chartering the proposed vessels.
A.   Traffic Forecast
5.02      The demand for crude oil for delivery to the Haldia terminal is
estimated as follows:
1975    1976    1977    1978    1979    1980
(Millions of mt)
Haldia Refinery           2.5     2.6      3.5      3.5     3.5      3.5
Barauni Refinery          2.2     2.2      2.2      2.2     2.2      2.2
Total         4.7     4.8      5.7      5.7     5.7      5.7
5.03      The proposed tankers would be capable of satisfying this demand
until 1977.
5.04      On the basis of present and planned refinery capacity, the follow-
ing imports of refined products will be required (Annex 1, Table 1):
1976       1978        1980
(Millions of mt)
2.4        4.4         8.6



- 13 -
In view of the indicated rapid growth and volumes involved, additional re-
fining capacity may be justified. On the assumption that an additional five
million tons of refinery capacity is operating by 1978, the demand for imports
will be reduced to (Annex 1, Table 2).
1976       1978        1980
(Millions of mt)
2.6       1.2          5.3
5.05      The proposed refined products tankers would be capable of trans-
porting a maximum of about 1.2 million tons of these volumes. This repre-
sents the following percentage of forecast imports:
1976       1978        1980
Case 1 - Present and Planned
Refinery Capacity (Annex
1, Table 1)                 50          27          14
Case 2 - Including Possible
Additional Refinery Capac-
ity (Annex 1, Table 2)      46         102          23
5.06      Three 16,000 dwt tankers, at present under construction, will
transport only about 80% of the forecast volumes of coastal movements. If,
therefore, imports of refined products fall short of the forecast, the pro-
posed products tankers could be used on coastal oil products movements.
Whether used for imports or coastal movements, they would displace chartered
tonnage.
5.07      The foregoing volumes do not in themselves guarantee the full em-
ployment of the project vessels during their economic lives. This could be
assured by an IOC agreement to charter the vessels from SCI for an appro-
priate period. Such arrangements are normal in the trade. Accordingly, a
time charter rate formula has been agreed between SCI and IOC and approved
by the Association.
5.08      Further details of Indian demand for crude oil and refined prod-
ucts are contained in Tables 4 and 5 and in Annex 1.
B.   Benefits
5.09      The economic benefits of the proposed investment would derive from
the difference between the costs to India of carrying crude oil and petroleum
products in Indian-owned ships as opposed to vessels chartered from foreign
shipowners. Available data and consultants' estimates indicate that there is
no appreciable difference between the operating costs of Indian and foreign
tankers. However, the long-run foreign charter rates also include elements



- 14 -
for capital recovery at an acceptable interest rate (depreciation plus ade-
quate financial return on the investment). By owning the vessels rather
than leasing them the Indians retain these returns on capital within the
Indian economy. These returns are thus translated from foreign exchange
costs to India into transfer payments within the economy.
5.10       Long-term charter rates are estimated on the basis of several
studies 1/ to include on average, a financial return on gross investment of
atleast 8X per annum after depreciation but before taxes over the life of
the vessel. This 8% average is considered to be the minimum long-term return
that will induce investment in shipping and is therefore a conservative basis
for calculating project benefits.
5.11       The element of depreciation included in the foreign charter rate is
a function of the capital cost of the ship and its economic life. Long-term
charter rates will tend to reflect the underlying capital costs whatever the
short-term effect may be of temporary conditions of over-supply or shortage
of shipping. Tanker shipbuilding costs and long-term charter rates are as-
sumed to remain constant, in real terms.
C.    Economic Return
5.12       The saving of the 8% return and depreciation elements in a foreign
charter rate based on the criteria explained above yields a return of about
12% on the capital investment by India in tankers. This calculation includes
the costs of minor port improvements and the corresponding benefits in faster
ship turnaround which will be derived therefrom (Table 7).
5.13       An increase in the 8% minimum financial return, assumed to be re-
quired by foreign shipowners, would increase the project's return. For
example, should a financial return of 10% be required, the return to India
would be 14%.
5.14       Another factor critical to the internal return calculation is the
operating costs of Indian ships relative to those of foreign shipowners.
Should Indian costs in practice prove to be lower or higher, the economic
return would be affected inversely. Annex 7 summarizes the sensitivity of
operating cost elements to relative variation. The only significant factor
capable of adversely affecting the competitive position of Indian-owned
tankers is the poor turnaround performance of Hindustan Shipyards, the only
Indian facility capable of dry-docking the crude oil tankers. However, even
1/    Z.S. Zannetos "Time Charter Rates", Analysis of the World Bank Ship
Fleet (Philadelphia: Sun Oil Company, 1967).
R.O. Gross "Cargo Liners - Turnaround and Costs" Journal of Transport
Economics and Policy, (January 1967).
Trevor D. Heaver, "The Economics of Vessel Size", (Ottawa: National
Harbours Board, 1968).



- 15 -
a 50% increase in docking time for each of the project ships would reduce
the return only to 11%. Taking all possible adverse factors into considera-
tion, it is unlikely that Indian operating costs would exceed foreign costs
by more than US$200,000 per annum for each crude oil tanker or US$165,000
for each products tanker. The net effect would be a reduction in the return
to about 10%.
5.15       Since the project's costs are largely in foreign exchange, a change
in the exchange rate of the Indian rupee would have a similar impact on both
the costs and the benefits of the project and, hence, the return would not
be significantly changed.
5.16       The proposed vessels would require a total of about 300 crew mem-
bers. However, it is quite possible that these men would find employment at
sea if the project did not materialize, since Indian crews are in demand in
international shipping. The project therefore would be unlikely to have any
significant effect on employment.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.    General
6.01       As mentioned in para. 3.01, the proposed Credit to the Government
would be relent to SCI through the agency of the SDFC. All the ships in-
volved in the project would be subject to time charter (T/C) agreements be-
tween the shipowner (SCI) and the charterer (IOC) for specific services for
periods of sixteen years - the same period as the amortization period of the
loan to SCI. Since such critical factors as ship prices and delivery dates
will not be known until the shipbuilding contracts are signed, a formula is
necessary for determining the T/C rates. The formula will ensure sufficient
revenues to the shipowner to cover its capital and operating costs and pro-
vide a fair profit margin.
6.02       The normal SDFC lending terms are interest at 8% per annum payable
half yearly and amortization periods of up to 17 years. If the borrower pays
amount due by prescribed dates and fulfills all obligations under the Loan
Agreement and other documents executed in respect of the loan, the effective
interest rate is reduced to 4-1/2% per annum.
6.03       The terms proposed by the Association are based on the following:
(a) an interest rate of 8-1/2% per annum payable half yearly;
(b)  repayment of the principal amount of the loan within 17
years in 16 equal annual installments.



- 16 -
B.   Time Charter Rate and Delivered Cost of Oil
6.04      The basic elements in the T/C rate formula would be:
(a) base year operating costs plus allowance for escalation
over the period;
(b) the amortization factor for the SDFC loan to SCI; and
(c) a fair profit margin as agreed between SCI and IOC.
The terms of the T/C and the formula for determining the T/C rate would be
included in a letter of intent from IOC, the draft of which has been agreed
upon by the Association and the various Indian agencies prior to negotia-
tions.
6.05      The delivered cost of oil will be affected not only by the relend-
ing terms and SCI's agreed profit margin, but also by the tonnage and price
of the ships. Annex 5 (Tables 1, 2 and 6) contains calculations of the de-
livery cost per ton of oil for the various fleet and ship sizes which could
meet the crude oil import requirements at the Haldia oil terminal. The cal-
culations indicate that the delivered cost of oil in 1980 would be lowest
with the use of ships of about 87,000 dwt. This financial forecast is in
line with the Consultants' tanker optimization study (Annex 4). In the case
of the products tankers, it is difficult to forecast the delivered cost be-
cause the trading pattern of the ships is unknown at present.
C.   Financial Return on the Investment
6.06      Given the proposed relending terms and T/C rate formula, the only
real scope for variations in the internal financial rate of return arises
from variations in the profit margin to be allowed to SCI. Table 8 shows
that the financial rates of return (before tax) would be about 12% on the
crude oil tankers and the products tankers.
D.   Financial Evaluation of the Shipowner
6.07      SCI's past financial performance is illustrated by the following:

6.08      The expansion in fleet tonnage over the next five years (including
the ships under consideration in this project) consists of 35 vessels total-
ling 1.4 million dwt, which would be financed by deferred credits from ship-
yards, foreign currency loans from Banks, SDFC loans and partly from SCI's
own resources. As a result of these commitments the debt/equity ratios com-
pared with the 1971 position are expected to be:
1971     1972      1973      1974     1975      1976

fleet expansion over the period 1970/71 to 1975/76, liouid balances must be
taken into account. The existence of adverse debt/equitv ratios concurrent
with satisfactory favorable current ratios and liquid positions is mainly
due to the restrictions imposed by the Government on the utilization of for-
eign currency earnings which prevents the use of cash accruals for ship pur-
chases, thereby increasing dependence on foreign exchange credits. On the
other hand the SDFC loans at concessional terms (long repayment period and
low interest rates) help alleviate the strain on finances which might other-
wise arise from such a financial structure. The withdrawal of the develop-
ment rebate 1/ on ships delivered after May 31, 1974 will have adverse ef-
fects on the company's liquid position, and may compel SCI to seek addi-
tional funds. Since existing SDFC loan agreements provide that SCI's debt
1/   A development rebate, akin to special extra depreciation, is available
to all companies in "priority industries".

equity/ratio should not exceed 86:14, the Government itself would most like-
ly have to provide the additional funds in the form of equity.
6.10      SCI's profits up to 1975/76 are forecast as follows:
1972    1973    1974    1975    1976
(Rs Lakhs)
Gross Profit                     1,903   1,891   2,419   3,754   4,394

Return on Equity                  10.9%   10.5%   10.2%    15.8%  11.7%
The estimates include earnings and expenses for additions to the fleet and
provide for escalation in freight rates and costs as detailed in Annex 3.
6.11      The Corporation's finances are sound and, it is expected to con-
tinue trading profitably.
E.   Financial Evaluation of the Charterer
6.12      IOC's financial position is sound (Annex 8) and, while profit
margins may contract owing to the rising prices of imported crude oil and
Government control of refined products prices, it can be assumed that this
will not be allowed to impair the financial strength of IOC in view of India's
dependence on this major supplier of energy and its importance to the Indian
economy. The withdrawal of the development rebate on May 31, 1974 will af-
fect the IOC's liquid position since the outflow for taxation payments could
be significant. Any resultant liquidity problems would be rectified by the
infusion of equity or loan capital by GOI.
6.13      IOC's financial performance over the past five years is illus-
trated by the following:

6.14      No detailed forecasts of future results are available but net
profits have been estimated to increase from Rs 2,040 lakhs in 1970, as
follows:
(Rs Lakhs)
1971          1972          1973          1974
2,115        2,583          2,993         3,416
% increase over
previous year           3.4%         22.3%        15.9%          14.1%
These estimates are in line with the forecast expansion in sales which is
based on the anticipated demand and product availability from the refineries
in India and on an increasing share of the total market.
F.   External Audit
6.15      SDFC's accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General
of India who has the same rights, privileges and authority in conducting the
audit as with other Government accounts. These accounts, together with the
audit report thereon, are subject to Parliamentary approval.
6.16      SCI's accounts are audited by two independent auditors and are
subject to review by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in accord-
ance with the provisions of the Indian Companies Act of 1956.
6.17      IOC's accounts are audited by three independent auditors and are
reviewed and reported on by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in
accordance with the provisions of the Indian Companies Act of 1956.



- 20 -
6.18      The auditing arrangements for all three organizations are satis-
factory and do nor require further action on the part of the Association.
7. CONCLUSIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
7.01      During negotiations:  (a) a time charter rate formula was negotiated
between SCI and IOC and approved by the Association (paras. 3.11 and 5.07);
(b) agreements have been drafted and approved by the Association regarding
terms and conditions of the sub-loans to be made by SDFC to SCI, including
clauses to be used by SCI in the shipbuilding contract providing for security
of advances (para. 4.20); and (c) the draft of a letter of intent from IOC
containing the terms of the T/C and the formula for determing its rate has
been agreed upon by the Association and the various Indian agencies (para.
6.05).
7.02      During negotiations agreement has been reached and assurances re-
ceived that:
(a) the applicability of tug and barge systems to Indian
coastal oil products movements will be studied (para.
2.13);
(b) the proposed dredging program for the navigation channel
to Haldia will go forward as planned as well as required
modification of the Haldia oil jetty. This work will be
paid for by CPC and recovered through port charges (para.
4.05);
(c) steps will be taken to acquire and operate such transfer
vessels as are needed to permit the most economic use of
the project crude oil tankers by 1975 (para. 4.07);
(d) necessary improvements to pollution control equipment will
be made at shore facilities prior to delivery of the ships,
including provision of slop tanks, improvement in practices
aboard ship and construction of facilities at Cochin (paras.
4.10, 4.11, and 4.12);
(e) IOC will study ways and means of improving tanker turnaround
time, including improved scheduling and the organization of
a marine department (para. 3.10); and
(f) details of the bidding procedure will be acceptable to the
Association (para. 4.17).
7.03      The proposed project is suitable for an IDA credit to GOI of
about US$83 million equivalent on the usual terms. GOI acting through SDFC
would lend the proceeds of the credit to SCI in accordance with the terms of



- 21 -
the shipbuilding contract. The loan would be repayable in 16 equal annual
installments within 17 years after the delivery of each ship and with in-
terest at 8-1/2% per annum payable half yearly calculated on the outstand-
ing balances from time to time.

Petroleum Forecast - Details
Forecast Assumptions
1.        The forecast of demand for refined petroleum products (Table 5) is
based on the following general assumptions:
(a) Indian economic growth will be maintained at the current
level throughout the period 1971-1976, giving an average
annual growth in national income of 5 to 6%.
(b) Growth in industrial and agricultural production will be
substantially in accordance with Fourth Plan targets.
(c) No administrative restrictions will be imposed on the
availability and consumption of petroleum products.
(d) Uniform development of all regions and the elimination, so
far as possible, of regional imbalances will continue to
be long-term objectives of Government policy.
(e) Sufficient foreign exchange will be made available by the
Government to permit purchase of the forecast volumes of
petroleum products imports (Tables 1 and 2).
2.        The forecasts for individual products are based on many detailed
assumptions of which the only ones of significance for purposes of this
project are:
(a) Shortfalls from target in the construction of fertilizer
and petrochemical plants will be made up before the end
of the Fourth Plan (March 31, 1974), and this will be re-
flected in the growth of demand for naphtha and fuel oil.
(b) The Government will not substantially change, by fiscal
or other measures, the prices of naphtha or fuel oil in
order to contain demand for these products.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
(c) The feedstocks of planned fertilizer and petrochemical
plants will not be changed from a petroleum base to a
coal base.
3.        If the foregoing detailed assumptions are not borne out, the maxi-
mum impact will be reductions of 955,000 tons in the 1975 volume of naphtha
and about 100,000 tons of fuel oil in 1975 through 1980. This is insuffi-
cient to affect the employment of the proposed products tankers.

4.        This was derived from a comparison of refinery output with demand
within each refinery region. The resulting imbalances indicated the volumes
of product which will need to be moved into, or out of, each region.
5.        Estimates of refined products movements appear in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 1 is based on the refinery capacities shown in Table 3, and shows a
rapid growth in imports such that additional refining capacity may well be
justified. Table 2 is based on the assumption that an additional 5 million
tons of refining capacity will be in place by 1978. This appears to be the
most reasonable and conservative basis for calculating required tanker
capacity.
Forecast of Required Tanker Capacity - Coastal Movements
6.        Using mileages for all combinations of origins and destinations
shown on Table 2, total ton-miles of 1,705 million were calculated for coast-
al movements in 1976. Three 16,000 dwt tankers, at present under construc-
tion, have an annual capacity of about 1,053 million ton-miles on the given
routes, leaving 652 million ton-miles available for the proposed product
tankers. Using the average mileage of 870, this is equivalent to 750,000
tons, or 39% of the annual capacity of the proposed tankers.

The Shipping Corporation of India
A. Background
The company was formed in 1961 by merging the Eastern and Western
Shipping Corporations under the Shipping Corporations Amalgamation order,
1961. The Corporation is an autonomous body working under the administrative
superintendence of the Ministry of Shipping and Transport through a Government-
appointed Board of Directors. It operates general cargo and passenger serv-
ices and has in recent years engaged in bulk dry cargo and tanker markets.
The following table illustrates the growth of the company's liner
services over the past nine years:

ANNEX 3
Page 2
The company's fleet has grown from 20 vessels of 203,000 dwt in
1962 to 78 vessels of 1.4 million dwt in 1971 (30% of the national tonnage),
consisting of 54 cargo liners, 6 passenger-cum-cargo vessels, 4 overseas tankers,
1 ore/oil carrier, 3 bulk carriers, 3 coastal tankers, 3 coal carriers and 1
timber carrier.
Services
The Corporation operates regular overseas cargo liner services to Canada,
the US, Japan, Australia, Poland, East Africa and is engaged in the coastal dry
cargo trades carrying coal and timber.
Tanker Fleet
Two coastal tankers are on charter to the private sector oil companies
and one to the State oil corporation. One overseas tanker of 36,000 dwt is on
charter to Caltex (India) for 10 years and moves crude oil between the Persian
Gulf and India; another of 48,000 dwt is chartered to the B.P. Tanker Company.
Two 88,000 dwt tankers delivered in 1969 and 1970 to carry crude oil from the
Persian Gulf to the Madras Refinery were time chartered to the B.P. Tanker Company
and a Norwegian shipowner because, owing to draft limitations, they were unable
to operate at Madras. As a result the company had to resort to chartering to
carry this traffic which amounted to 1,460,000 tons in 1970.
Bulk Carriers
During 1968 the company took delivery of three 41,000 dwt bulk carriers,
which are on time charter carrying ore and grain. The first of the company's
85,000 dwt oil/ore carriers, delivered in February 1970, was placed on time charter
to Seabridge, London.
The company currently has 29 vessels on order: 7 general cargo liners,
6 container vessels, 6 bulk carriers, 3 coastal tankers, 2 overseas tankers,
3 OBO carriers and 2 passenger-cum-cargo vessels (Table 1).
Suxmmaries of the company's balance sheets and profit and loss accounts
for the last five years and ending March 1971 are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Salient features are:
1. Freight earnings increased steadily from Rs 2,838 lakhs in 1966/67
to Rs 6,330 lakhs by 1970/71. The freight increase in 1966/67 was largely accounted
for by the devaluation of the rupee and consequent increase in rupee revenue. The
increase in freight earnings in other years arises from the continuous expansion
of services from 11 to 20 and in the cargo carried from 1.7 million tons in 1966/67
to 2.4 million tons in 1970/71. Gross profits rose from Rs 967 lakhs (34% of
freight) in 1966/67 to Rs 1,947 lakhs (31% of freight) in 1970/71. Operating
profits have risen from Rs 500 lakhs (17% of total income) in 1966/67 to Rs 706
lakhs (10.9% of total income) in 1970/71, while the 10.2% return on capital employed



ANNEt 3
Page 3
in 1966/67 has since declined to 6.6% at the end of 1970/71, due mainly tc
an increase in operational expenses, which exceeded the increase in freight
earnings and the effect of advance payments for ships under construction.
2. SCI's authorized capital is Re 3,500 lakha. The issued and sub-
scribed capital as at March 31, 1971 amounted to Rs 2,345 lakhs all in ordinary
shares of Rs 100 each. The company's reserves on that day stood at Rs 3,095
lakhs. The company paid its first dividend in 1968/69 - 5% continued at this
level up to 1969/70 but in 1970/71 the rate was increased to 6%.
3. SCI's long-term borrowing as at March 31, 1970, amounted to
Rs 8,632 lakhs as follows:
Rs Lakhs
SDFO                        5,562
Banks                         498
Deferred Credits            2,572
4.  At the end of 1970/71 the gross block of fixed assets amounted to
Rs 14, 476 lakhs. The net block after writing off depreciation of Rs 3,571 lakhs
(about 24%) stood at Rs 10,905 lakhs. Payments on account of ships under con-
struction amounted to Rs 2,175 lakhs on that date. The company's fixed debt of
Rs 8,632 lakhs was covered about 1.5 times by its net fixed assets including
advance capital expenditure.
5. The company's cash and bank balances as at March 31, 1971, amounted
to Rs 635 lakhs and the liquid position as indicated by the ratio of current
assets to current liabilities at 1.5:1 was satisfactory.
6.  Cash accruals during the five-year period 1966/67 to 1970/71 averagec
Es 920 lakhs per year.
7. Taxation during the period under review has been limited to foreign
income tax payments since, through its considerable investment program, the
company has benefited from the relief granted by the development rebate and
other tax concessions on new vessels.
B. Management and Organization
A chart showing the organizational structure of the company is attachec'
(Table 4). The management caliber compares favorably with many shipowning
companies in developed countries. As the largest shipping company in India, it
has had no difficulty in recruiting well-trained staff to fill key positions,
as witnessed in particular by the competence and efficiency of the Research,
Planning and Development Department, the Comuercial and Traffic Department and
the Finance Department. The delegation of responsibility which is a feature of
this company encourages decision making and makes the staff feel that they play
an important role in their respective fields and thus help improve overall
efficiency.

Operating costs tend to be aomewhat higher in certain areas, e.g.
insurance, when compared with some Indian private sector companies.  Budgeting
is carried out to a fairly detailed extent and there is excellent cooperation
between the Budget and Control division and other departments; budget variations
did not exceed 10%. The delay in producing management information should be
roduced once the oomputer is installed. Improvements in ships' operational
performancea are being introduoed by the technical departments concenied.
There ia an aotive training policy and managers are sent on various
courses, and ohanges are readily accepted in this company. Much of the company's
success is due to the organizational and managerial ability of the Chairman n
Managing Director in directing, controlling and leading a team of competent
managers.
C. Fleet Expansion and Financing
In addition to the capital expenditure involved in financif.- le
purchase of the 29 vessels on order, SCI will have to make repayments agp. '
its existing and new commitments inoludifig the  project tankers.  Total funcId
required during the period are estimated at Re 33,954 lakhs (Table 5) as o1lo;

Repayment of deferred credits                                2,405
33,2564
The above requirements will be met by:
Deferred credits                                             4,469
Foreign currency loans from banks                              562

AN^NEX 3
Cash Accruals
The company's net cash accruals over the past five year-s averaged
Rs 920 lakhs. For the five-year period, 1971/72 to 1975/76, the net cash
accruals are estimated at Rs 10,358 lakhs.  A part of these accruals wil- bt.
used for the down-payment on some of the ships and for meeting other corltdntns
during this period.
Deferred Payment Credits
The company has suppliers' credits totalling Rs 2,785 lakhls repayabilu
over 10 years at an interest rate of 3.75 per annum for four R manian bu.ik carrieCs
and six East German cargo liners.  The Japanese OBO carrier has a sUpi tr2 credit
of Rs 1,140 lakhs repayable over 8 years at 74  interest per annum.  There is
also a supplier's credit available on one of the Yugoslav tankers amounting to
Rs 5T44 lakhs repayable over 5 years at 5% per annum.
Foreign Currency Loans from Banks
The company has negotiated a loan of Rs 562 lakhs to finance 40% of
the cost of one of the Yugoslav OBO carriers. This loan is repayable in five
equal semi-annual installments commencing three years after the date of drawing
down. The interest rate is 6% per annum.
Loans from Government and SDFC
At the end of March 31, 1971, SCI's outstanding amount of the '&oans froa
the Government and SDFC was Rs 5,562 lakhs.  The coapany has arranged for loans
from SDFC covering from 45% to 95% of the payments on various vessels being- purchzse
over the period under review and also against the suppliers' credit installments
as they fall due. On this basis the company would be able to obtain Rs 21,955
lakhs during 1971/72 to 1975/76.  These SDFC loans will bear interest at 3% per
annum on loans up to March 31, 1971 and 44  per annum thereafter.
On the basis of the above financial plan SCI's debt equity ratio which
was 61/39 at the end of March 1971, is expected to go up to 77/23 by the end of'
March 1974, improving to 74/26 in 1975/76.  Its ratio of current aEsets to current
liabilities is expected to improve somewhat from 1.5:1 in 1970/71 to 2.1:1 by
1 975/76.
The company's total long-term debt will increase from Rs 8,632 lakhs
to around Rs 30,000 lakhs by the end of March 1976.
D. IFture Financial Position
Projections of the company's results and financial position during the
period 1971/72 to 1975/76 (Tables 6 and 7) are based on the following asswriptionIs
(i) Estimated income and expenditure includes the operating
results for all vessels expected to be delivered during
the next five years.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
(ii)  Coastal tanker charter hire rates have been taken at
Rs 41.85 up to 1973/74 and Rs 46.50 thereafter. For
overseas tankers and large bulk carriers a rate of
Rs 22.50 has been assumed and Rs 30.30 for small bulk
carriers. All rates have been taken on the basis of
330 operational days, which is conservative.
(iii) Costs will be matched by freight rate increases. However,
stevedoring charges have been escalated at 8% per annLu.
Based on the above, the company's gross profits for the year 1971/72
are estimated to be Rs 1,903 lakhs, rising to Rs 4,394 lakhs by 1975/76.   Thle
operating profit would increase from Rs 776 lakhs in 1971/72 to Rs 2,774 lak1-s
in 1975/76. The rate of return on capital employed would decline from 6.6/.
1970/71 to 4.3% by 1973/74, improving to 8.9% in 1975/76, when the corpan;;arr
new fleet would become fully operative. The decline in the rate of returi i-s
mainly due to the costs of ships under construction. For the period up ;
1974/75 the company's liability for income tax is expected to be conrfined to
a foreign tax liability of around Rs 50 lakhs per year. Due to the developmsnt
rebate and other tax allowances available under Indian income tax law, the
company has not incurred any liability for Indian income tax.   c -wver, the
development rebate is to be withdrawn from ships delivered after Hay 31, 1974
and unless other concessions are introduced this will have a considerable impacb
on the company's cash position.

Tanker Optimization Study
Computer runs were undertaken for the Association by Prof. H.
Nowacki and Mr. P.M. Swift of the Department of Naval Architecture and
-rine Engineering, University of Michigan to determine the optimum tanrker
'imensions to serve Haldia. A summary of the optimization data produced
by these runs is given below. The data show, for given assumptions, the
delivery cost per long ton of crude oil, and may be summarized as follows:
No. of trials                        13
Range of dwt, lg ton                 75,030 - 79,813
Range of draft, ft                   39.5 - 40.5
No. parameters tested                18
The sensitivity results of the various computer runs are set out
below in terms of the effect on the freight rate required to provide the
returns noted. A period of 20 years has been used for the amortization of
interest and principal. The index numbers indicate the general effect of
alterations in the various parameters on the delivery cost of crude oil.
They indicate that, for example, a 50% increase in fuel costs would affect
the freight rate about as much as an increase of 15% in capital costs and
that a 15% increase in capital cost alone results in an 8% increase in
freight rate. The data are not comparable with those calculated for spe-
cific ships as shown in Annex 6.

Crude Oil Transportation Systems
1.        The attached tables depict the various transportation systems
considered for appraisal.  The demands to be met are set according to the
estimated refinery requirements taken at 95% of rated capacity in the years
.oted.  CPC provided the available draft in the approach to the oil unload-
ing pier.
2.        The cost data developed is based on the following:
(i) Capital costs - Actual quotation made to SCI for a 76,600
dwt ship. Interest during construction has been added to
this price to obtain the total capital invested which is
to be amortized.
(ii) Amortization - for comparative purposes the total capital
investment in each ship has been amortized annually accord-
ing to an annuity formula.
(iii) Standing charges per ship, are the remaining elements of the
time charter cost of the ship, consisting of wages, victualling,
ship stores, sundries, repairs, management costs, survey allow-
ance, and insurance. The current costs of these items for
various sizes of ships have been checked against SCI data.

Comparison of Vessel Operating Costs - Owning Versus Chartering( ) -
and Sensitivity of Economic Return to Cost Factors
Expenditure                      Comment               Degree of Sensitivity
Capital Costs       Same whether owned or chartered            None
Fuel Costs          Not included in charter rates,
therefore same whether owned or            None
chartered
Port Charges        Not included in charter rates,
therefore same whether owned or            None
chartered
Insurance          For comparable risk coverage, costs
to an Indian shipowner would be            Insensitive
similar to those for a foreign
shipowner with similar fleet policy
Management          Similar whether vessel is owned or
Expense           chartered and only a small element         Insensitive
of total costs
Crew Costs          Indian manning scales are sub-
stantially higher than those of
many other maritime nations but pay        Insensitive
scales are substantially lower. Net
effect is that crew costs to the
Indian shipowner are similar to
those for the foreign shipowner
Stores and          These costs are largely a function
Sundries         of the ports to which ships operate         Insensitive
and therefore would be similar whether
the ship is owned or chartered.
Surveys and         Survey and repair costs at Indian ship-
Repairs           yards are not significantly different    Sensitive
from those of foreign ship repair docks.
(1) Assumes long-term (at least 3-year) charters. Such charters are normal
practice in the oil industry in order that a substantial proportion of
its oil movements is guaranteed at a fixed cost.

However, ship detention time in yards
other than Mlazagon Dock is 50% to 100%
higher than in other countries. Indian
crude oil tankers would use Hindustan
shipyard's dry dock which is the only
one large enough to accept 80,000 dwt
ships, while foreign tankers might use,
say, Singapore. Hindustan's repair and
survey performance is not precisely known.
Ilowever, abnormal delays of, say, 12 days
for such a ship would cost about $100,000.
This delay would be sufficient, if experi-
enced by all four crude oil tankers, to
reduce the economic return from 12% to
11%. Indian products tankers would use Insensitive
Mazagon Dock whose costs and turnaround
performance are comparable to those of
foreign dockyards.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd-
The Corp-,oration was form,e.d in 1964 as a result of a merger of the
Indian Oil Co. Ltd., and Indian Reil         ltd. 'boh cf whi.ch were public
sector companies.
Sales increased from Rs 2.06)2 milllion JIn 1965/66 to Rs 6,356 mil-
lion by 1969/70. Gross profit has az>o7,m fzow R.s 95 millij.n (4.6% of revenue)
in 1965/66 to Rs 363 million (5.7,, o1: -rrvenue) j.) 1969/70.  The return on
capital employed has improved from 3,8'% i'.l 1965/66 to 13,7% irn 1969/70
(Table 1).
Authorized capital iF Rs 850 i fllhion and the issued and subscribed
capital at March 31, 1970 was R5 712 mil.ion, all in ordinary shares of
Rs 1,000 each.  The company's reseries on that date amounted to Ks 390 mil-
lion.  The following dividends have been paralpd on ordinary shares:  1965/66:
nil; 1966/67: 6% and 1967/68 to 1969/70: 7%.
Long term debt at Mlarch 31, 1970 amounted to Rs 752 million; this
included a GOI loan of Rs 537 million, Bank loans of Rs 148 mi llion and a
foreign credit of Rs 67 million (Table 2).
As at March 31, 1970 the gross block of fixed assets amounted to
Rs 1,731 and after writing off depreciation of Rs 343 million, stood at
Rs 1,388 million.  Construction work in progress amounted to Rs 108 million
on that date. The companyvs fixed debt of Rs 752 million was covered about
twice by its net fixed assets, including advanced capital expenditure at
the end of March 1970.
Rs. 7.4 million in subsidiaries and Rs 2.2 million in trade in-
vestments are included in the company's investments of Rs 11 million. The
subsidiaries are: the Indo Burma Petroleum Co. Ltd., and the Indian Oil
International Ltd.; both companies are engaged in the sale of petroleum
products.
The debt/equity ratio at March 31, 1970 was 41/59 and the ratio
of current assets to current liabilities was 1.5:1, both of which are satis-
factory.
Profits are estimated to increase from Rs 211 million in 1970/71
to Rs 341 million in 1973/74 (Table 3)r These estimates are in line with
the forecast expansion in sales which is based on anticipated demand and
product availability from the Indian refineries and on obtaining an in-
creased share of the total market.

IOC has not incurred any income tax liability as a result of the
development rebate and other tax concess,ions. However, in common with other
companies in "Priority Industries", the withdrawal of the development rebate
after May 31, 1974 will have a considerable impact on IOC's cash generation
as the outflow for taxation payments in the future could be significant.
Financial and accounting management has been strengthened by the
streamlining of budgeting and accounting systems, thus insuring optimum
utilization of resources and manpower.
