INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXEUCTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA
FOR A SHIPPING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recomnendation on a
proposed Credit in an aaount in various currencies equivalent
to US$83.0 million on standard IDA terms to finance a shipping
project in India.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank Group has so far played a limited role in
financing shipping. The Bank made several loans for ships to the
Netherlands in 1948 and loans to the Republic of China in 1963
and 1967 for deep-sea fishing vessels. Ships have been financed
indirectly through lending to development finance companies in
India and elsewhere, but the credit now proposed would be the
Bank Groups' first direct lending for ships in recent years.
3.        The project would widen  the scope of the substantial
Bank Group assistance for the transport sector in India. The
Bank and the Association have made six loans and five credits to
the Indian railways for a total of US$706 million (net of cancel-
lations), of which about US$125 million has been repaid. Other
Bank Group lending in this sector comprises three loans and one
credit for the ports of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay (totalling
US$82 million), one credit for highways (US$60 million) and a loan
for civil aviation (Us$5.6 million), The Bank Group has also
assisted the local manufacture of commercial vehicles through the
six industrial imports credits between 1964 and 1970.
4.        In recent years, the share of agricultural projects in
Bank/IDA operations has increased substantially, reflecting the
high priority which the Government accords to agriculture in the
current Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-74). Agricultural lending
is expected to account for a large share of future Bank Group
assistance to India. There are also plans to provide assistance



-2-
for education, family planning, urban investment, and possibly
rural works programs; however, the scope for lending in these
fields would not be very large, at least initially. Quite
apart from these efforts to achieve greater diversification of
our lending, financing of investments in industry, public
utilities and transportation will. continue to play an important
role in our program to meet the large and increasing needs for
funds in these areas. Reports and recommendations on proposed
credits for an agricultural credit project in Maharashtra, and
a wholesale markets project in Bihar were distributed on
February 16. During the remainder of this fiscal year, I expect
to present credit proposals for a further industrial imports
project, a family planning project and a development finance
company project designed specifically to assist small-scale
industry.
5.        Since 1949, the Bank has made forty loans amounting to
US$1 ,111 million and the Association forty credits amounting to
US$1 ,696 million (both net of cancellations) to India. Of these
amounts, uS$512 million has been repaid and US$662 million is still
undisbursed. Comments on the status of disbursements of effective
loans and credits are given in ny report and recommendation on a
proposed credit for the Maharashtra agricultural credit project.
6.        IFC has made thirteen conmmitments in India since 1957
totalling US$42.3 million, of which US$3.3 million has been
repaid, US$5.9 million sold and US$6.3 million cancelled or ter-
minated. Of the balance, US$18.6 million represents loans and
US$8.2 million equity. Of this total, US$5.9 million was undisbursed
on January 31, 1972. The largest IFC commitment to date has been
US$18.9 million to Zuari Agro-Chemicals Limited for a fertilizer
plant in Goa. A summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as
of January 31, 1972 and IFC investments as of January 31, 1972 is
in Annex I to this report.
7.        The proposed project was identified and prepared  in
March/April 1971 and appraised in July/August 1971. Negotiations
were held in Washington from January 31 through February 7, 1972.
The Borrower was represented by Mr. Ge C. Baveja, Joint Secretary,
Ministry of Shipping and Transport, Mr. R. Tirumalai, Joint
Secretary, Mr. P. N. Jain, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance;



-3-
and Mr. Bose, Ministry of Justice. The Shipping Corporation of
India was represented by its Chairman, Mr. C. P. Srivastava;
Mr. L. M. S. Rajwar, Manager, Research and Planning and Mr. K.
N. G. Mennon, Chief Development Manager.
PART II  - THE ECONCMY
8.        An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-25a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 24, 1971 (R 71-120) and a memorandum entitled "India: Major
Economic Issues" (R 71-249 dated November 9, 1971) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on November 9, 1571.  A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II.
9.        Since the recession of 1966-68, the Indian economy has grown
at an average annual rate of about 5 percent, largely reflecting the
encouraging progress of agriculture. Foodgrain production in the last
crop year reached 108 million tons, which is 8.5 percent above the
level of the preceding year. This is due in part to substantial
investment in irrigation and also to the increased and more effective
use of current inputs, such as improved seeds, fertilizer and pesti-
cides. But weather remains an important factor both in agriculture
and - because agriculture contributes nearly half of India's aIP - in
determining overall economic growth.
10.       Manufacturing now contributes about 20 percent of GNP.
India's current Five-Year Plan (1969-74) aims at an annual growth rate
of 5.5 percent for the economy as a whole, and an increase in manu-
facturing output by about 8 to 10 percent a year in both the organized
and the small-scale industrial sectors. Medium and large-scale
industrial production rose by about 7 percent in both FY 1968 and FY
1969, by just over 5 percent in Fl 1970 and remains low in FY 1971.
The main reasons for this disappointing performance appear to have
been shortages of raw materials, especially steel and cotton, and also
inadequate demand for investment goods reflecting the shortage of
financial resources.   In contrast, small-scale firms seem to have
benefited directly from the advance of agriculture and have made con-
siderable gains.
11.       The Government has followed strict budgetary and monetary
policies in recent years and net foreidg exchange reserves are now just
over one billion dollars. During 1967-71 imports (especially of food)
came down sharply and, as a result, India's trade deficit decreased
from US$1.3 billion equivalent in FY 1967 to US$130 million equivalent
in FY 1 971.



-4-
12.       A major cause of concern has been the low rate of invest-
ment. Net investment was 12 percent of national income in FY 1970
against nearly 15 percent in FY 1966. Among the reasons for the
low level of investment is the sharp decline of net aid receipts
from US$800 million in 1966/68 to about US$300 million in 1970/71.
13.       At the beginning of this fiscal year (April) the basis
was laid for substantial expansion of investment activity through
the introduction of additional taxes and an expected increase level
of public savings. However, events intervened before economic
development could benefit from these efforts. Large numbers of
refugees started ccming across India's eastern border requiring
food and shelter. From December 3 to 16, there was open conflict
in the sub-continent. The majority of the 10 million refugees have
now returned to their homeland but the Indian Government is providing
substantial financial support for their resettlement and to the
economy of Bangladesh.
14.       According to preliminary estimates, the net budgetary cost
of refugee support in the current Indian fiscal year may be in the
order of US$285 million equivalent. By-December 31, 1971, the
Government had incurred direct expenditures of about US$400 million
and estimated that a further US$40 million would have been spent by
March 1972. In addition, repatriation of the refugees is expected
to cost about US$40 million. Total budgetary expenditures may,
therefore, reach US$480 million equivalent. Against this figure,
international contributions received and pledged, excluding US$25
million earmarked by voluntary agencies for use in their own programs,
amounted to US$195 million. The financial burden imposed by the war
on the Government's budget is more difficult to estimate. About
Rs. 12.5 billion or 3 percent of GNP was budgeted for defense expen-
ditures for this year. No supplementary appropriations for defense
were sought but some contingency funds may have been used.
15.       Special taxes for meeting refugees' costs were imposed in
October and may yield approximately US$45 million. Further taxes to
cover expenditures incurred during the emergency were introduced in
December and may yield a similar amount. The bulk of the funds
required to meet net expenditures related to the refugee program and
the armed conflict were apparently raised through recourse to deficit
financing. In fact, there are indications that the budget deficit
for the fiscal year will substantially exceed the planned amount of
Rs. 2.3 billion. Increased inflationary pressure would thus seem to
be the most serious economic problem arising from the refugees and
the war, and to the extent it cannot be contained, the effects will
be diffused throughout the economy, affecting the level of real
consumption as well as of real investment.



-5-
16.       In real terms, food made up by far the largest Indian
contribution to aid to refugees, but since India's stocks of food-
grains have been and remain ample, the impact on the economy has
been deferred. The disruption of transport and coimummications due
to military operations was confined to the border areas and the
dislocation of production has been minor.
17*       Public sector investment has not been cut in monetary
terms.   On the other hand, the large increase in deficit financing
may well mean that the planned increase of investment will not
materialize in real terms. Furthermore, the additional taxation
introduced at the beginning and in the course of the fiscal year
may well reduce the level of private savings and investment.
18.       Despite considerable and well planned efforts to mobilize
dcmestic resources there has been, and will eontinue to remain, a
substantial resource gap in India. This has led to the accumulation
of a large amount of external debt and a high debt service burden.
For the past four years, the Consortium has provided debt relief to
India. Thus, India's debt position calls for cautious debt management
and particular restraint in eontracting additional short-term debt in
the form of suppliers' credits. A realistic development plan which
is responsive to priority investment needs and sound monetary and
fiscal policies designed to stimulate private and public savings
qualify India for continued IDA assistance.
PART III - THE PROJEfCT
19.       A report entitled "Appraisal of First Shipping Project -
India" (PTR-102a), dated February 5, 1972, is being distributed
separately. A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III.
20.       Shipping is an important industry in India. The Indian
merchant fleet ranks fifteenth in tannage among those of the world
and comprises about 250 ships, totalling 3.8 million deadweight ton
(dwt). India's ships carry about 15 percent of her overseas trade;
about 5 percent of crude oil imports are at present carried by
Indian tankers.  Imports of crude oil, which amounted to 11.6 million
tons in 1970, are expected to be more than twice that much by 1976.
Imports, exports and coastal movements of refined petroleum products
are expected to grow no less rapidly than imports of crude oil.
Coastal transport of petroleum products offers scope for substantial
expansion in a country with a long coast line and with important
consumption centers located on or near the coast. At present, only
aboutlO percent of total consumption of refined products is being
distributed by coastal shipping. As Indian demand for refined
products is expected to grow from a present level of 18 million tons
to 32 million tons in 1976, the growth of coastal transport of
petroleum products is likely to be particularly impressive.



-6-
21,.      The project, which forms part of the Indian Fourth
Five-Year Plan (1969-74), would provide some of the transport
services required by increasing oil refinery capacity and by
rapidly increasing consumption of refined products. The project
consists of: (i) the purchase of four crude oil tankers in the
80,000 dwt class for use between the Persian Gulf and Haldin, and
(ii) the purchase of two refined oil products tankers in the
20,000 dwt class for the import, export and coastal distribution
of refined petroleum products. In addition, shore facilities will
be improved and pollution-control equipment installed at Haldia,
Cochin and other oil-handling ports. One or more crude oil transfer
vessels totalling about 16,000 dwt for use at Haldia will also be
provided.
22.       The four crude oil tankers would be capable of transporting
about 4.8 million tons per year, meeting the initial demand for crude
oil delivery at Haldia for use at both the Haldia and Barauni
refineries. Crude oil demand by these two refineries is expected to
increase from 3.5 million tons in 1974 to 4.7 million tons in 1975
and 5.5 million tons per year in 1977 and thereafter. The product
tankers would be used primarily for the import and export of refined
products. They would be capable of transporting about 102 million
tons per year, about 50 percent of the estimated import demand for
refined petroleum products in 1976.
23.       The cost of the oil tankers, on the basis of bids received
by the Shipping Corporation of India Limited (SCI), is estimated at
about US$82.6 million made up of about US$63.6 for the crude oil
tankers and about US$19 million for the products tankers, all in
foreign exchange, The proposed credit would provide this sum plus a
contingency of Us$40O,000. The Government of India has undertaken to
finance the shore facilities and pollution-control equipment needed,
and SCI has committed itself to provide the crude oil transfer vessels.
The cost of these is estimated at US$0.5 million equivalent and
US$1.3 million equivalent, respectively; the expenditures would be
entirely in local currency.
24.       In the course of appraisal, the Association examined with
SCI the alternative of buying used ships. SCI opposed this alternative
on operational grounds. While it might be possible to find ane tanker
meeting the necessary specifications, it would be very unlikely that
as many as four tankers could be found to meet the delivery schedule
defined by the plan of new refinery capacity. The price of a used
ship, the cost of refurbishing it and the costs relating to synchro-
nizing its delivery, with capacity requirements was estimated at least
to equal, if not to exceed the price of a new ship.
25.       Current depressed short and medium-term charter rates are
not comparable alternatives to the proposed purchase and a comparable
long-term charter could only be obtained at a significant premium.



-7-
Furthermore, the proposed shipbuilding contracts appear to be
well timed to take advantage of the current relative slack in the
shipbuilding business and consequent competitive prices and short
delivery periods for new ships.
26.      The Government will lend the proceeds of the proposed Credit
to SCI through the Shipping Development Fund Committee (SDFC), a statu-
tory body created by the Government in 1958 to facilitate the growth of
the Indian shipping industry. Although its charter would permit it to
borrow funds in the market, SDFC is in practice a channel for Government
loans and grants made available to it to meet approved loan commitments
to public and private shipping companies. SDFC has proved itself
thoroughly competent in making and administering shipping loans. The
conditions required by the Association for the on-lending of the credit
proceeds to SCI can be readily accommodated in SDFC's standard loan agree-
ments, mortgage deeds, and covenants. By using SDFC as an intermediary,
the administration of the project will be considerably simplified. SDFC
lending to shipping companies out of government funds is typically for
periods of up to seventeen years for large new vessels or two-thirds of
the residual life of used ships, with one or two years grace period.
Effective interest rates have hitherto been 4-1/2 percent perannum.
27.      The Government loan to SDFC would be at 7-1/2 percent and
repayable in sixteen equal annual installments beginning two years
after the delivery of each ship.  SDFC's loan to SCI would be at
8-1/2 percent repayable on the same terms. The SDFC loan to SCI
would be secured through mortgages an the tankers and on other vessels
owned by SCI, as well as by the right of assignment of charter revenues.
SDFC will pass the foreign exchange risk on to SCI.
28.      SCI will purchase, own and operate the six tankers to be
financed by the proposed Credit. SCI is the largest shipping campany
in India. It is a well-managed public sector corporation and its
performance compares favorably with shipping companies in developed
countries. SCI operates general cargo vessels, dry bulk-cargo vessels,
tankers and passenger ships. In June 1971, its total fleet consisted
of 78 ships totalling 1 .4 million dwt; a further 29 ships totalling
over 1 million dwt are on order, not including the tankers to be
purchased under the project. SCI's financial position is sound. In
1970/71, operating profits produced a return of around 7 percent on
capital employed, which after a period of fleet expansion will increase
moderately. SCI's debt-equity ratio wiUl increase from 61:39 in 1971
to a peak of about 77:23 in 1975, as a result of the heavy expansion
program undertaken by the company. The loan agreement to be concluded
between SDFC and SCI under the proposed project will require that
SCI's debt-equity ratio does not exceed 86:14. This isin accordance
with SDFC's standard policy and is considered satisfactory.
29.      The six tankers to be financed with the proceeds of the
proposed Credit would be chartered to the Indian Oil Corporatimn (IOC)
for sixteen years from the delivery of each ship. The charter rates



-8-
would cover base year operating costs plus allowance for escalation
over the charter period, amortization and interest for the loan
from SDFC to SCI, and provide a margin to SCI equivalent to 4.8
percent of the cost of the ships declining to 2.55 percent over the
charter period. A maintenance of value provision would pass the
exchange risk on the SDFC loans to SCI on to IOC.
30.       IOC, like SCI, a Government-owned corporation, is the
largest oil company in India. Its financial positicn is sound.
IOC owns and operates several refineries, including the refinery
at Barauni, with a total capacity of 6.65 million tons. IOC will
also own and operate. the refinery which is being constructed at
Haldia. IOC's operations are efficient. At present, IOC does not
have a department to supervise and coordinate marine transport. In
connection with the proposed project, IOC has undertaken to establish
a special marine department to be concerned with tanker movements,
uidch should improve the present turn-around performance, especially
of coastal tankers.
31*       The six project tankers are being procured by international
competitive bidding. SCI solicited tenders from 28 shipyards in
eleven countries for the crude oil tankers and from 22 shipyards in
ten different countries for the products tankers. In addition,
sale and purchase brokers of international standing were asked for
bids. The bids received by the January 10 deadline will be valid
until March 9, 1972.
32.       Disbursements under the proposed Credit would be made
against payments under shipbuilding contracts after March 1, 1972.
Up to 20 percent of the value of the contracts would be payable
within six months of signing; further payments would be made during
construction and on delivery of the ships. Disbursements would be
completed by late 1974.
33.       The economic benefits of the project to India derive from
the difference between the costs and benefits to India of owning and
operating the ships compared to chartering equivalent tankers from
foreign shipowners. It is estimated that a foreign-owned tanker
would operate on the basis of a before tax return on capital
employed of 8 percent, and that operating costs of India and foreign
tankers would be roughly the same. On these assumptions, the
annual return to India would be 12 percent.
34.       The three largest international oil companies own from 33
percent to 60 percent of their tanker requirements. The average for
all major oil companies is 45 percent. These companies charter the
balance of requirements on long, medium, short and spot charter
markets. During any one period on3y from 10 percent to 15 percent
of total requirements are competitively offered on the "charter market'".
A team of Government-owned companies such as IOC and SCI,interested in secu-
ring a steady flow of oil from a closely defined geographic area to a few
refineries, will tend to rely for only a small part of its needs on the
charter market. This is borne out by the policy of such companies as Pet-
robras (Brazil), IFtrofina 3elgium) and of French and Japanes oil interests.



-9-
The proportion of crude oil requirements carried by Indian tankers
falls far short of the industry's normal level, and a significant
expansion of India's tanker fleet in the interest of steady oil
supplies at relatively stable prices would appear to be fully
warranted. As India has started to enter into a number of long-term
contracts with other governments for the supply of crude oil, the
desire of some measure of independence in transporting these supplies
would appear particularly understandable.
35.       The economic return calculation does not take into account
possible benefits to the economy to be obtained by stabilizing the
delivery cost of petroleum. The tanker charter market has been
subject to sharp fluctuations in the past and as a consequence,
excessive reliance on its subjects the delivered price of oil to
substantial fluctuations. Tanker ownership provides a safeguard
against these fluctuations.
36.       The Government, through the commissioner for the Port of
Calcutta, is undertaking substantial investments for the improvement of
navigation channels up to the Hooghly River to Haldia amounting to
about US$74 mil1ion equivalent. These works involve the deepening of
the water at the Haldia pier, and the turning area and dredging of
the Hooghly estuary gradually to a usable depth of 41 feet by 1980.
Until that time, the project tankers would have to be lightened by
up to 16,000 tons in order to cross the bars and enter the channel.
The provision of transfer vessels srves this purpose. The lightening
and transfer operations would be similar to those carried out for
grain in the same waters and are technically feasible. In order to
improve turn-around time, the Government will improve shore pumping
facilities to facilitate quick unloading and loading of crude oil
and product tankers.. Further measures to speed up the turn-around
of tankers would be the subject of a special study to be undertaken
by IOC. Further, the Government and IOC will undertake a detailed
study to investigate whether the eventual use of tugs and barges for
the coastal transport of petroleum products would be feasible and
economical.
37.       Matters of transport policy and coordination have been
discussed recently with the Government of India during negotiations
of the Eleventh Railway Credit. The Government has decided to under-
take a full review of the transport sector, and the Association will
contribute to this review by means of a comprehensive sector mission.
The review is expected to take about eighteen months and to lead to
an understanding between the Government and the Association on the
basic policies to be followed in the sector as a framework for future
Bank Group lending for India's transportation system.
