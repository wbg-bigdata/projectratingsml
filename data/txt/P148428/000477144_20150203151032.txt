A. Summary of Proposed Changes
The proposed changes are: (i) the extension of the closing date from February 27, 2015 to April 30, 2015; (ii) reallocation of
funds; (iii) update of the results framework (Annex 1); and (iv) dropping of some activities under component two of the
project.

a.       Closing date extension. An extension of the closing date from February, 28, 2015 to April 30, 2015. This is the first
request for extension of closing date to April 30, 2015. With this extension, the Project will be eight months old at the time
of the new closing date. The extension will enable financing of eligible civil service salaries in non-security sectors in
Mogadishu; and salaries and allowances for Subject Matter Experts for January and February 2015. Additionally, it will
facilitate the extension of contracts of consultants supporting the External Affairs Fiduciary Section (EAFS) for project
implementation to April 2015.

b.      Reallocation. A reallocation from component three and two to component one to finance the payments of civil
service salaries in non-security sectors and payment of fees and allowances to Subject Matter Experts who are supporting
the core government functions for the months of January to March. The project description in the amended Grant
Agreement reflects this change.

c.      Results/indicators. A revision of the Results Framework based on the findings of the mid-term review to be able to
better measure the PDO indicators, baselines, progress data and targets for all indicators and adjust and/or add any
indicators to show all the results that the project has been achieved. There are no changes in the PDO. This is reflected in
Annex 1.

d.      Dropping Activity: Dropping of two activities under component two (Strengthening Systems for expanded
operations and service delivery). The activities to be dropped are as follows:

i.       TA for EAFS/Monitoring and Evaluation work – The activity was included with the understanding that the support
by the government of Norway (GoN) for the services of the Monitoring Agent supporting the review of the salary payments
will end by December 2014. However, GoN has extended the services of the MA up to March 2015. As a result, this
activity is no longer required.
ii.      HR/payroll support in CSC US$300,000: The activity on strengthening reliability and integrity of payroll and
engagement of Technical Assistance is already supported by another Development Partner. To avoid duplication of donor
support, this activity would be dropped under the project.

B. Project Status
The project objectives continue to be achievable. Based on the current Implementation Status Report and the
implementation support in October 2014, the progress toward achieving the development objective and implementation
progress are satisfactory. As of January 26, 2015, ten million dollars (sixty three percent) of project funds are disbursed.
Seventy two percent of project funds are fully committed. With this restructuring, all project funds will be fully committed.
The progress towards achieving the PDO and overall implementation progress are satisfactory. The performance of the
project is rated satisfactory. Details of the project components and results achieved are as follows:

Component 1: Emergency Support to Core Government Functions in Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) -
US$13.0 million. This involves financing of eligible civil service salaries in non-security sectors in Mogadishu; financing to
subject matter experts and allowances; and financing of eligible non-salary recurrent cost expenses in four pilot agencies.

The project has financed the payments of civil service salaries in non-security sectors and payment of fees and allowances
to Subject Matter Experts who are supporting the core government functions for the months of July to December 2014. The
project is financing about ninety percent (about 3,600 staff in 34 MDAs) of civil service salaries in non-security sectors; an
increase of eighty nine (89) percent from the baseline of 1,907 staff at project effectiveness. The initial plan in the Project
Appraisal Document was to finance the salaries of the eligible civil servants and SMEs from July to December 2014. This
was based on a projected total number of civil servants of 3,909 indicated in the government 2014 civil service projection.
However the number of staff eligible for financing in each of these months was less than projected, resulting in a savings
than is sufficient to pay salaries for the months of January and February, prior to the effectiveness of phase two of the
project in April 2015.

The regularity of salary payments has improved. The December salaries were paid after twelve days of the statutory
payment date. This is an improvement on the baseline time lag of fifty eight days in June 2014. Additionally, the
Monitoring Agents (MA) has carried out regular payroll verifications for all the five months of salary payment from July to
November 2014. The December verification is on-going.

The guidelines for payments of non-salary recurrent costs are being finalized by government. A draft has been circulated
and will be finalized by January 31, 2015. The component is rated as satisfactory.

Component 2: Strengthening Systems for Expanded Operations and Service Delivery (US$1.0 million): This involves
expanding support for recurrent cost expenditures to Puntland and the Interim Jubbaland Administration; support to


                                                                                                          Page 6 of 16
strengthen the reliability and integrity of payroll; support to strengthen the social sectors and strengthening the external
affairs fiduciary section (EAFS). Regional reviews are on-going in Puntland and Jubbaland Administration in respect of
subsequent plans for support in recurrent costs expenditures. Additionally, the contract to support the strengthening of the
social sector is being finalized. The support to strengthening the reliability and integrity of the payroll has not progressed
because similar activity is currently being supported by another development partner and it is proposed to be dropped under
this project. Additionally, the contract for the Monitoring Agent was extended by the Government of Norway from
December 2014 to end of March 2015. As a result, the project allocation under this component for monitoring agent support
from January 2015 to the project closure would not be required and the restructuring proposes the dropping of this activity.
The component is rated as moderately satisfactory.

Component 3: Project Management and Coordination (US$ 2.0 million) including audit, training and operational costs. An
unallocated amount of US$1 million is also included under this component.

C. Proposed Changes

                                           Development Objectives/Results
Project Development Objectives
Original PDO
The Development Objective for the Series of Projects is to enable the Somali Government to achieve reliable and
transparent financing of critical civil service operations to help strengthen the legitimacy of the state. The Development
Objective of this first project in the Series is to finance and support an operational payroll and payment system for the
non-security sectors. This aligns with the MPF objective is to foster socio-economic recovery and stabilization by
supporting the payment of civil service salaries, and the running costs of government institutions; financing technical
assistance and supporting the building blocks of larger public investment programs across a range of sectors.
Change in Project's Development Objectives           No change
Change in Results Framework
Explanation:
Indicator 1: Number of civil servants in non-security sectors paid - A revision downwards of the end target from the initial
projection of 3,909 staff (based on the expected FGS payroll number in the 2014) to 3,600 staff. The mid-term review
revealed that while the total number of civil servants on the government payroll as of October 2014 was 4,012 (above the
government 2014 projection), only 88% are currently authorized and eligible for payments under the RCRF project. The
projection for the end of project is that about 90 percent (3,600) will be eligible and paid.

Indicator 2: Reduction in days of delay in payments of Civil servants salaries in non-security sector. The indicator name is
amended and rephrased from 'percentage of registered civil servants salaries paid on time'; and the unit of measured
changed from percentages to days. This reflects a robust indicator based on the lag between the statutory and actual pay date
of the salaries to eligible civil servants and a more definite measurement in days rather than percentages.

Indicator 3: Number of Payroll verifications undertaken by independent agent: With the new closing date extension by two
months, the end target value for this indicator is also increased to six.

The intermediate results indicators have also been amended to reflect the changes in the PDO indicators.

Change in Loan Closing Date(s)
Explanation:
The restructuring involves the extension of project closing date by two months from February 28, 2015 to April 30, 2015.
This will enable the financing of eligible civil servants’ salaries in non-security sectors in Mogadishu and financing of
subject matter experts for January to February 2015, prior to the preparation of phase two of the project. This is the first
request for extension.

Other Change(s)
Explanation:
The restructuring includes the dropping of the activity related to the strengthening of reliability and integrity of payroll and
engagement of Technical Assistance for monitoring and evaluation for the External Affairs Fiduciary Section under
component two of the project as this is already supported by another Development Partner.

The restructuring also involves a revision of the Results Framework based on the findings of the mid-term review to better
measure the PDO indicators, baselines, progress data and targets for all indicators and adjust and/or add indicators to show
all the results that the project has been achieving. This is reflected in Annex 1.

                                       Change(s) in Appraisal Summary
Appraisal Summary Change in Risk Assessment
Explanation:
With the change in the risk assessment tool from ORAF to SORT, this is the first update of the SORT in the system.
Apart from technical design of the project which is now rated moderate because of the implementation progress, all
other risk ratings are same as during the project preparation and effectiveness.

The overall risk rating is high. Somalia is a high-risk environment and careful management of risks is required.
Major country risks include the overall security situation, with incessant instability and a volatile security situation
due to an active insurgency being led by Al-Shabab. This could have a number of direct and indirect impacts on the
program, ranging from periodic travel restrictions to a direct attack on the CBS – the primary pay point for civil
servants – by Al-Shabaab. The program will mitigate these risks by taking account of the regular security advice
issued by the World Bank and UN, and by relying heavily on the more flexible security arrangements and access
arrangements used by the Monitoring Agent to ensure that Phase I project implementation can continue when staff
travel is restricted. The project will also rely on the security measures that the FGS has taken to protect the CBS and
other core PFM institutions from attack.

Country risks also include overall insecurity and political instability, and more specific risks related to
macro-governance challenges such as poor FGS policy choices. The project seeks, to the extent possible, to mitigate
against overall insecurity and political instability by adopting a phased approach under the Series of Projects,
whereby Phase I is relatively small, and future allocations are flexibly negotiated on an annual basis as part of the
budget process, thereby making the project responsive to a highly uncertain and rapidly changing country risk
environment. The project will mitigate against more specific macro-governance challenges through strong policy
dialogue with the authorities, focusing on their macro-fiscal and economic governance track record.

Sector and Multi-Sector risks include the risk of poor macro-fiscal management by the FGS. Specifically, poor
revenue forecasting, under-collection of revenues, insecurity, and weak cash management could result in liquidity
constraints leading to non-payment of salaries and accumulation of arrears. The program seeks to mitigate these
risks by, under the Phase I project, providing an advance equivalent to three months of salaries with a revolving fund
structure. This should ensure that civil servants’ salaries continue to be paid irrespective of revenue performance in
the second half of 2014. In addition to using the revolving fund model, Phase II will also help to mitigate this risk by
including an incentive-based allocation to promote domestic revenue mobilization.

There are also multi-sector risks relating to the integrity of payroll system data resulting from multiple payroll lists
being managed by different institutions (NCSC, CBS, MoF, MDAs). This risk is currently being mitigated by
multiple manual checks, and by use of biometric data and ID cards at the point of payment (CBS). A more
comprehensive mitigation will be achieved through the a more ‘scalable’ payroll system, which is being developed
in coordination with other projects, including: i) the SFF, which is supporting the rapid development of an interim
HR information database tool to consolidate payroll information in a single place, and; ii) by the PFM Strengthening
project, which is developing an SFMIS HR and payroll module to ultimately perform this function under NCSC.

There is also a risk that the number of civil servants eligible for reimbursement under the RCRF program is
significantly lower than the number budgeted for. As explained, this gap arises because some posts have not been
filled, and because some FGS institutions prefer to remain ‘off-SFF’ and hence ‘off-RCRF’. This risk will be
mitigated by ensuring that reimbursements are solely based on eligible expenditures and reallocating unspent funds
within the MPF. In addition, lack of policy on the award of allowances and uncollected salaries (arrears and
liabilities) is a potential risk. This will be mitigated by supporting the Government and coordination with other Bank
supported projects to develop the requisite policy guidelines. The Phase II project will also, through dialogue, seek


                                                                                                      Page 10 of 16
to ensure that more ministries and departments come onto the RCRF program, thereby increasing the transparency
and accountability of the FGS payroll.

Implementing agency capacity constraints are severe, particularly in procurement and financial management,
representing a risk to implementation. Specifically, there is also a short-term capacity risk during the Phase I project
that transitioning from the FMU (used by SFF) to the EAFS could disrupt the timely preparation of accurate
withdrawal applications. This is being mitigated by the leadership of the FMU/EAFS change management and
merger process by the Ministry of Finance, by the retention of FMU consultants within the EAFS, by additional
advisory support to be provided by three PFM Strengthening project advisors within the EAFS, and by additional
support and backstopping from the monitoring agent.

 Governance risks, including the risks of corruption are high. There is a reputational risk to the World Bank if RCRF
program funds are found to have been diverted to other purposes, either directly or as a result of the freeing up of
domestic resources which would otherwise have been spent on civil servants’ salaries (i.e. a ‘fungibility’ risk).
These risks are being mitigated through: i) the adoption of controls around payroll introduced under the SFF, and the
retention of the SFF Monitoring Agent to provide quality assurance and due diligence on the salary payments and
non-salary recurrent expenditures, and; ii) the relatively small size of the Phase I project, coupled with budgetary
dialogue and flexible annual allocations under the Phase II project.

The primary Delivery Monitoring and Sustainability risk relates to the role of the monitoring agent and the banking
and payments arrangements. On the monitoring function, the Phase I project is heavily reliant on the role of the
Monitoring Agent (MA) to provide quality assurance and due diligence on the salary payments and non-salary
recurrent expenditures. An MOU will be agreed with Norway on the use of the consultant currently engaged under
the SFF program, an agreement which runs until December 31 2014. The primary risk here is therefore that the
monitoring agent role will need to be covered for the final two months of the Phase I project period (January –
Februarys 2015), and development of a new monitoring function for the Phase II project will need to begin well in
advance given the lead times typically involved. This risk will be mitigated by the development and implementation
of a plan for the monitoring agent function after December 31 2014.

As regards risk pertaining to banking and payments, there is a risk that the established banking and payments
channel may prove fragile. This is due to perceived AML/CFT risk in the banking sector, as well as concern that the
ultimate beneficiaries of transactions may be sanctioned individuals. This was a major lesson from the experience
with the SFF, under which there was a delay after the project effectiveness date in finding a private bank willing to
act as a financial intermediary between the Government of Norway and the FGS. This risk is being mitigated by: i)
the successful transfer of funds from the World Bank to the CBS under the recipient executed PFM Strengthening
project (albeit smaller amounts than under the Phase I project); ii) the rapid development of a banking and payments
contingency plan for MPF projects and programs; iii) the World Bank and IMF financial sector work, including
support for the licensing of financial institutions in Somalia (both transfer and banking licensing), and to support the
development of new correspondent banking relationships iv) migration of the payroll function to the Financial
Management Information Systems (FMIS) payroll module to take advantage of the embedded ex-ante and post ante
payroll controls. The World Bank can also draw on extensive experience of managing banking and payments
arrangements in fragile and conflict affected contexts, including situations where electronic funds transfer was not
possible. Finally, the appraisal mission found that the risk that civil servant salaries might benefit sanctioned
individuals is low, with the Monitoring Agent to perform a check against consolidated lists of total civil servants
upon entry to the RCRF program. The risk that non-salary recurrent expenditures may benefit sanctioned individuals
was adjudged low to moderate, with all vendors to be checked against targeted and global sanctions lists, and
adopting a risk-based approach to detect abnormal transaction patterns.

A likely risk is the possibility of delay in payments of civil servants salaries in subsequent months after period
covered under this restructure. This could arise if there are delays in effectiveness of the phase two of the RCRF

Project Development Objectives
Original Project Development Objective:
The Development Objective for the Series of Projects is to enable the Somali Government to achieve reliable and transparent financing of critical civil service operations to help strengthen
the legitimacy of the state. The Development Objective of this first project in the Series is to finance and support an operational payroll and payment system for the non-security sectors. This
aligns with the MPF objective; to foster socio-economic recovery and stabilization by supporting the payment of civil service salaries, and the running costs of government institutions;
financing technical assistance and supporting the building blocks of larger public investment programs across a range of sectors.
