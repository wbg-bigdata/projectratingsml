                   acceptability, provided that no event has
                   occurred since such notification which has, or
                   may reasonably be expected in the future to
                   have, a material adverse effect on the financial
                   condition or operating results of such
                   Participating Local Government; and
            (v)    whenever for the purposes of this Section it
                   shall be necessary to value, in terms of
                   currency of the Borrower, debt payable in
                   another currency, such valuation shall be made
                   on the basis of the prevailing lawful rate of
