MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO rHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO $180.3 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE
EAST JAVA - BALI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for $180.3 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 20 years including five years grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would assist in financing urban
infrastructure and improved service delivery in up to 36 of the 37 local
governments in East Java and all eight in Bali plus a limited program of water
distribution expansion for the City of Surabaya. Part of the proceeds ($50.0
million equivalent) would reimburse the Government of Indonesia (GOI) for
loans to the participating local governments and their water enterprises for
periods of 5 to 20 years and at annual interest rates indexed to market rates
through a formula resulting in rates ranging from 9 percent to 11.5 percent
per annum. A Japanese grant of $4.2 million equivalent would partially defray
costs of technical assistance. The Central Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
2.        East Java is Indonesia's largest province with an estimated 1990
population of 33 million including an urban population of about eight million,
including the second largest city in the country, Surabaya (about 2.5 million)
and hierarchies of smaller cities and towns spread across the 36 other local
governments. The much smaller neighboring province to the east, Bali, has a
total population of less than three million and an urban population of about
700,000, but is nevertheless of major importance to the regional and national
economies due primarily to its dynamic tourism industry. This tourism
industry relies upon services, facilities and labor that are based largely in
urban areas. The urban areas of East Java and Bali are central to the
economies of both, and are expected to increase from about 25 percent of total
population in 1990 to between 35 and 40 percent in 2000. Surplus rural labor
has been absorbed rapidly in the urban economies of both provinces during the
past two decades, which has contributed to the reduction in rural poverty
during this period. The continued absorption of such labor into productive
employment and with improved living conditions is critical to economic and
social development of the provinces.
*        3.        Urban Infrastructure Development Issues for East Java and Bali.
Urban infrastructure investment, rehabilitation and operations and maintenance
(O&M) in East Java End Bali have not kept pace with needs, even though the
economies and living conditions in both provinces have improved markedly since
1970. Considerable deficiencies remain in both coverage and quality, raising
doubts about the capacities of either province to continue their relatively
good records of economic growth and improved living conditions. Doubts are
particularly strong regarding the physical coverage and quality of what GOI
has designated as the seven urban infrastructure subsectors: water supply,
roads, drainage, sanitation, solid waste management, improvement of kampung
neighborhoods (the Kampung Improvement Program--KIP) and improvement of market
neighborhood infrastructure (the Market Infrastructure Improvement Program--
MIIP). In addition, a range of environmental, financial and institutional
problems include: (a) poor cost recovery, organization and management; (b)
severe pollution of surface water (and increasingly of groundwater), from
human and municipal wastes, and from a rapidly rising volume of industrial and



-2-
toxic wastes; (c) inadequate micro-infrastructure and basic environmental
sanitation services in the urban kampungs, where most low-income people live,
resulting in unhealthy environments which limit the social and economic
potential of the human resources; (d) inadequate policies and operational
programs for O&M of infrastructure and utility services; (e) inadequate local
revenue generation and limited use of municipal borrowing and private sector
participation in delivery of municipal services; and (f) unclear relationships
between local, provincial and central government authorities with respect to
assignment of responsibilities for preparation, appraisal, financing,
implementation and O&H of infrastructure services. Although these
shortcomings are common to most provincial and local governments in Indonesia,
the provincial and local governments of East Java and Bali have skilled
personnel and experience for addressing most of the *rban challenges.
4.        Government Strategy.  To address these priorities on a nationwide
basis, the Government issued a Statement of Policies for Urban Development in
1987 which provided a consolidated view of the principal constraints arising
from, and the objectives prescribed for, the development effort in the sector.
The Policy Statement emphasizes: (a) strengthening local governments to
assume the leading role in developing, operating and maintaining local
services on a sustainable basis over the long term; (b) improving the
planning, programming and implementing of investments on the basis of a
decentralized and integrated approach (Integrated Urban Infrastructure
Development Program--IUIDP); (c) revising grant flows and mobilizing local
revenues to better balance local government revenue and service
responsibilities; (d) implementing a coordinated financing system for the
development and administration of local services; and (e) strengthening the
consultative process at all levels of government. The current national five-
year plan (Repelita V) refers to all of these objectives, and the five-year
plans for East Java and Bali refer explicitly to the IUIDP approach as the
appropriate vehicle for overall improvement of the urban sector.
5.        Bank Strategy.  Bank strategy takes into account its long
association with the sector and GOI's current priorities. However, based on
lessons from from completed projects, as well as the experience gained under
ongoing operations, the Bank also recognizes that implementation of the IUIDP
approach would require flexibility depending on the degree of institutional
capacity of individual provincial and local governments. For example, in
provinces such as East Java and Bali and large cities such as Surabaya and
Semarang, where institutional capacity is relatively more advanced, a
programmatic type of operation through the IUIDP approach would be justified.
This approach could not be applied fully in much of eastern Indonesia, where
institutional capacities are too weak. In such cases traditional project
lending focussing on a single or selected group of subsectors such as water
supply or urban transport, or a combination of KIP and solid waste management
would be more appropriate. The full IUIDP approach is also not appropriate at
the present time in metropolitan Jakarta where subsectoral requirements are so
large and complex that they should be financed separately or in small groups.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would:
(a) support the urban sector strategies of GOI and the Bank; (b) provide
financing for types of subprojects that would support both economic
development and poverty alleviation that have been confirmed to be feasible
and beneficial in a variety of GOI and Bank experiences in two provinces with
capable governments; (c) provide the first opportunity for GOI and the Bank to
test and develop the full IUIDP approach; and (d) provide a programmatic model



for evaluation and the choice of approaches in other provinces. The proposed
project would also be of special interest to other donors, who are involved
with preparation or implementation of IUIDP-type projects in 16 of the 27
provinces. GOI has requested Bank support for similar projects in the other
eleven provinces, adjusting the approach in line with local capacities.
7.        Proiect ObJectives.   The fundamental objective of the proposed
project would be to improve the quality of urban infrastructure investments
and service delivery in East Java and Bali. Operational objectives would be
to: (a) support urban infrastructure investment (including rehabilitation) in
*        45 local governments in East Java and Bali including a limited expansion of
water distribution in the City of Surabaya (other investments in Surabaya City
would be covered under a separate project now under preparation); (b) improve
urban infrastructure expenditure programming, financial planning and
information management for these local governments; (c) encourage local
revenue generation, improve financial management and, more generally,
strengthen local government human resources and institutions including
capacities for more effective community participation and environmental
management; and (d) support sector development nationwide, including
preparation of future urban projects.
8.        Project Description.  In support of these objectives the project
would include three components to be implemented over six years: (a) the
infrastructure expenditure program covering the costs of investment and O&M
in up to 45 local governments in East Java and Bali for seven urban
infrastructure subsectors (urban water supply, roads, sanitation, drainage,
solid waste management, KIP and MIIP), including only water distribution
improvements in Surabaya; (b) program management support covering costs of (i)
program and subproject preparation, and (ii) program management; and (c)
institutional development support covering costs of (i) implementation of
national municipal management improvement programs (local revenue
administration reform, financial accounting and management reform,
environmental assessment and IUIDP training) in selected East Java and/or Bali
local governments, and (ii) sector development (co-financing of the ongoing
UNCHSIUNDP IUIDP Implementation Support Project and preparation of future
projects for Bank financing). The infrastructure expenditure programs have
been fully prepared, appraised and adopted for a first Obatch" of 13 local
governments, nine in East Java and four in Bali. Second and third batches, as
identified on the attached map, are scheduled to be ready for implementation
*       no later than during the second year of project implementation.
9.        The proposed project would be carried out by participating
provincial and local governments, led by the GOI Coordination Team for Urban
Development (TKPP) composed of the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Home
Affairs, Ministry of Finance and the National Development Planning Board
(BAPPENAS). The Project cost is estimated at $360.5 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of $123.5 million equivalent (34.3 percent), and
taxes and duties estimated at about $24.4 million equivalent. The total
financing required, including interest during construction, is $373.4, of
which the Bank would finance $180.3 million equivalent (100 percent of the
foreign costs plus 19.5 percent of local costs). The project cost summary and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement
arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of up to $2
million has been recommended for civil works, goods and consultancy services
expenditures incurred after March 31, 1990. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are



given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report No. 8756-
IND, dated February 25, 1991, is being distributed separately.
10.       Actions Agreed.  Assurances and confirmations were reached with GOI
on the following: (a) local government borrowing terms, conditions and
operating procedures; (b) the content of the Program Implementation Agree-ents
(PIAs) including subproject selection criteria; (c) revised grant channeling;
(d) project accounting and auditing arrangements; (e) project management
arrangements; (f) Bank review of new and revised subprojects and programs;
(g) water enterprise tariff reviews and levels; and (h) environmental
assessment arrangements.  Signing of a local PIA between a Project Province
and a participating local government, and making a domestic lending
arrangement between the Ministry of Finance and a participating local
government satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement for
the funds to be provided for each participating local government. Each local
government is also required to establish the project accounting and monitoring
system (PFAMS) in the local Project Finance Office within three months of each
participating local government receiving funds under the Project.
11.       Benefits and Risks.  The most important expected benefits and risks
of the project are inherent in GOI's gradual movement toward regional
autonomy. The chief benefits would flow from more efficient use of resources
allocated to the sector through better programming of urban infrastructure and
services by increasingly capable local governments. The chief risk is that
the pace of required institutional development--for decentralized systems of
management, resource generation and implementation responsibility--is
difficult to predict and may not be adequate for full and timely achievement
of all project objectives. The quality of subproject preparation and
implementation will be a focal point of Bank supervision as local governments
learn how to fulfill new roles. These risks would appear to be relatively low
in East Java and Bali given their high livel of institutional capacity.
Moreover, total urban infrastructure expenditure programs during Repelita V in
East Java and Bali will not be substantially higher in real terms than during
Repelita IV, and there will be few, if any, new or complex kinds of
subprojects. Finally, the UNDPIUNCHS IUIDP Implementation Support Project and
funds supplied under a Japanese technical assistance grant would provide
substantial support in carrying out effective project supervision.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
