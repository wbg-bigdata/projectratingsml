MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO BURKINA FASO
FOR A HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT (PDSN)
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed development credit to Burkina Faso for SDR 21.2 million, the equivalent of US$29.2
million on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a health and nutrition
project.  The Government of Burkina Faso would contribute US$2.0 million.  Parallel
cofinancing of about US$4.1 million and US$3.6 million is expected from the Federal Republic
of Germany (KfW) and UNICEF respectively.
2.           Country Economic Backgrround. Burkina Faso is a landlocked country with a
population of about 9.5 million. With a per capita GNP of about US$290 in 1991, Burkina Faso
is among the poorest countries in the world. In particular, the level of ht.,nan resources
development is extremely lo-v. In a 1993 UNDP ranking of 173 countries according to their
level of human resources development, Burkina ranked 170th. Basic social services are relatively
undeveloped. The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector, which accounts for about
30% of GDP, generates over 60% of export earnings and employs almost 90% of the
economically active population. With the other 12 countries of the CFA franc zone, Burkina
Faso devalued its currency by 50% relative to the French franc in January 1994.
3.           Sector Background. The health status of the Burkinabe population is poor as
reflected by a life expectancy of only 48 years (1991) compared with the average for Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) of 51 years (1991). A major contributing factor to this low life expectancy is high
infant and child mortality caused by widespread contagious diseases, unfavorable hygienic
conditions, malnutrition, and the limited capacity of the health system to prevent these conditions
and to treat them effectively once contracted. The maternal mortality rate is also high at 810 per
100,000 births (1988). Less than half of all pregnant women receive any prenatal care, and only
a third have births attended by health personnel. Nearly one in five babies has a low birthweight,
greatly increasing the risk of infant morbidity and mortality. Only 19 percent of children under
five are completely immunized, and the leading causes of infant and child mortality are measles,
meningitis, malaria, respiratory infection and diarrheal disease. The impact of infectious disease
is compounded by malnutrition. Nutritional surveillance data from 1991 indicate that 30-40
percent of children age one to four are at least moderately malnourished and nearly 13 percent
are severely malnourished. Micronutrient deficiencies are widespread, resulting in high incidence
of anemia, goiter, xerophthalmia and other nutrition-related illnesses.
4.           Burkina Fasc, has traditionally been one of the countries in the world most
severely afflicted with onchocerciasis (riverblindness). By the mid-1970s, this disease had
reached epidemic proportions in 85% of Burkina and constituted a severe public health problem
and major constraint to socioeconomic development of the rural areas. It was estimated that 15 %
of the population at that time was infected with the disease. The blindness rate in the most
heavily infected villages averaged 10% generally and 50% among villagers over 40 years of age.
Through the Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP), a regional Program now supported by 22
donors, including the Bank, and covering eleven West African Countries, transmission of
onchocerciasis has since 1975 been interrupted throughout the entire country and the disease has
ceased to be a public health problem. However, without further action at the national level to
detect possible recurrence of the disease and provide treatment, the prospect of a resurgence of
the disease in Burkina and a spillover into neighboring countries remains.
5.           Project Objectives. The project would assist the Government in its efforts to:
(a) improve significantly the quality, coverage and utilization of basic health services for the



2
Burkinabe population, (b) enhance the nutritional status of the population, and (c) develop a
national capacity for achieving sustainable control of endemic parasitic diseases.
6.            Project Description. (Percentage ef total project costs are indicated for each sub-
component.) To achieve the above objectives, the Project (PDSN --Projet de DWveloppement de
Sante et Nutrition) would support policy reforms and investment designed to: (1) improve qualihy,
coverage, and utilization of health services by: (a) strengthening the health system pyramid
(49.6% of total project costs) through : (i) functional upgrading/construction of health facilities
and increased supervision of staff operations and of referrals at the primary and secondary levels
which comprise the "health district"; (ii) establishing an effective maintenance system for
"district" facilities; and (iii) improving operations of regional and national hospitals; (b)
rationalizing staff use and promoting staff development (3.1 %) by: (i) establishing realistic and
efficient staffing nLrms and implementing a staff redeployment action plan based in part on the
results of the hospital sector study; (ii) supporting in-service training for district medical officers
in supervision procedures; and (iii) upgrading skills of district level physicians in emergency
surgical procedures; (c) decentralizing tlte public health system (10. 1%) by: (i) defining a
country-wide system of health districts; (ii) providing for increased autonomy in planning and
budgeting at the district and sub-district levels; and (iii) providing for community co-management
of primary health services; (d) increasing availability of essential drugs (9.0%) by: (i) supporting
policy reforms and implementing actions to promote importation and distribution throughout the
health system of low cost quality generic drugs as a substitute for high cost specialty drugs; and
(ii) establishiing an effective cost recovery policy which would ensure a sustained supply of
essential drugs at the primary and secondary levels; (2) Reduce 'nicronutrient deficiencies by: (a)
supporting supplementation of vitamin A, iodine, and iron in severely deficient areas (10.5%);
and (b) developing a longer-term, durable national strategy for reducing micronutrient
deficiencies, which would include inter alia dietary modification and/or food fortification (1.6%);
(3) Achieve control of endemic parasitic diseases by: (a) strengthening the capacities of the health
system to carry out epidemiological surveillance and treat detected cases of onchocerciasis
(riverblindness), trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), and dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) through
training and supervision of mobile teams and local health workers (2.7%); and (b) sensitizing
target populations regarding prevention of transmission of these three diseases, through training
and IEC campaigns (1.0%); (4) Strengthen the Ministry of Public Health and Social/Family
Action (MSASF) by: (a) enhancing and rationalizing its capacity to more effectively concrol
endemic parasitic diseases (1.8%); (b) strengthening its capacity to implement the reform of the
pharmaceutical sector (0.7%);  (c) establishing a management information system to track
physical assets and personnel throughout the public health system (1.4%); (d) improving capacity
to coordinate, monitor, and evaluate donor-supported health projects (4.3%); and (e) enhancing
capacity to coordinate implementation of PDSN (3.9%).
7.            Project Imnlementation.  The project components would be managed and
implemented by the MSASF. However, UNICEF will be the executing agency for the nutrition
component, and subcomponents to decentralize the public health system and promote staff
development related to the distribution of essential, generic drugs, under an agreement to be
signed between the Government and UNICEF as a condition of project effectiveness. The Project
Coordination Unit, set up under the First Health Project (FHP), would be responsible for
interacting with IDA and for coordinating with MSASF directorates at the central and district
levels as well as with the Ministries of Finance and Plan, and outside organizations such as
NGOs, the Onchocerciasis Control Program, and UNICEF.
8.            Project Sustainability.  A  major objective of the project is to promote
sustainability in the health system by: (a) enhancing the autonomy and financial independence of
the first and second tiers of the system, (b) redeploying personnel from urban to rural areas and



3
ensuring that they remain where posted, and (c) restoring the confidence of the population in the
system to ensure effective use of existing health infrastructure. The project's emphasis on
substituting generic for expensive brand-name drugs would make possible a partial cost recovery
system (i.e.; covering at least the cost of essential drugs), which would help in sustaining the
functioning of health services at all levels of the system. The nutrition component, in addition
to immediate micronutrient supplementation, would pursue sustainable solutions to micronutrient
deficiency based upon dietary modification and, where feasible, food fortification, (e.g. ensuring
iodized salt). The principal objective of the project's endemic disease control component is to
enable Burkina to sustain its single greatest health achievement in the past 20 years - full control
over onchocerciasis. Simultaneously, the devolution component would aim to sustain control of
trypanosomiasis in the onchocerciasis-fTeed areas and eradicate dracunculiasis.
9.            Lessons Learned. The design of the proposed project corrects two weaknesses
identified in the Operations Evaluation Department audits of World Bank health projects. These
weaknesses have also hampered implementation of the First Health Project (FHP) in Burkina
Faso. They are: (1) lack of decentralization, and (2) lack of improvement in the quality of care.
PDSN emphasizes decentralization coupled with training and supervision through district
management teams designed to improve the quality of care, and priority is given to improving
the quality of services through existing structures. There are three other lessons to be learned
from the implementation of the FHP. First, emphasis on providing buildings and other
infrastructure will accomplish little if complementary changes in health care policy are not
forthcoming. It became clear by 1988 that decentralization of health care services would be
essential to project success but virtually all project activities were concentrated on the
implementation of the investment component. Dialogue on the need to give the peripheral health
facilities inore autonomy and discussions on the drug supply/distribution/import situation did not
start until after the 1988 mid-term review of the FHP-too late to achieve timely adoption of the
necessary complementary policy reforms. Under the proposed project these policy issues have
been addressed during preparations and most necessary actions have been taken prior to
negotiations. Second, despite a sizable project/Government input for training in the FHP, the
impact of the training on improved health care is unknown. To avoid such a recurrence in the
proposed project, IDA will review and approve the content of iraining programs prior to their
implementation, and the Government will introduce a rmonitoring system under which supervisors
will--at regular intervals-report on the accomplishments/shortcomings of former trainees. Third,
introduction of the necessary policy reforms urder the FHP took too long because agreement on
these reforms was only sought through policy dialogue during implementation rather than earlier
during the processing of the Project. Under the proposed project virtually all policy reforms have
been addressed up front, prior to negotiations.
10.          Rationale for IDA Involvement. Low life expectancy ard high infant and
maternal mortality rates partly reflect the low quality, unavailability, and underutilization of
Burkina's health services. The second Five Year Development Plan calls for an ambitious
program of construction and upgrading of health facilities during the 1991-95 period. To reach
the rural and urban poor, improvements in, and expansion of. basic health facilities receive
highest priority.  Budgetary constraints preclude financing the basic health program without
donor assistance. System-wide reforms such as those proposed by this project invK,lving the
organizational structure of the health delivery system, redeployment of staff. basic financing
mechanisms, and the refcn'm of the pharmaceutical sector go beyond most aonors' scope of
intervention because of the extensive analytical work and policy dialogue required to get these
reforms accepted and ensure that they are implemented.  Health problems caused by
micronutrient deficiencies such as blindness, cretinism, anemia, etc., could be corrected through
relatively low-cost remedial action. The proposed development credit is consistent with the
Bank's countiy assistance strategy (CAS) for Burkina Faso which was discussed by the Board in



4
February 1992. The proposed pzzJect address>z the CAS objectives of strengthening of basic
health services with emphasis on the delivery of essential generic drugs, and improving the
nutritional status of the population, so as to promote human resources development and poverty
alleviation. The next CAS Board discussion for Burkina Faso is scheduled for May 1994. The
country's tight financial situation would make it difficult to continue the wativities necessary for
surveillance of the areas cleared from onchocerciasis and to prevent recrudescence of the disease.
Integrating trypanosomiasis control and dracunculiasis eradication actMities with control
maintenance of onchocerciasis, as defined in Burkina's "devolution plan", would be a
cost-effective approach to eliminating these endemic diseases and would make a significant
contribution to rendering oncho-freed areas safer for resettlement. Burkina has sought bilateral
sources of financing for its devolution plan since 1989 without result. Supporting Burkina's
devolution plan would safeguard a major donor investment of US$500 million in the
Onchocerciasis Control Program--including US$50 million in grant financing from the Bank-to
successfully rid the West African region of this endemic disease which has been a major
constraint to development.
11.          Aereed Actions. During negotiations, the Government provided assurance that
it will: (a) complete the hospital sector study by June 30, 1995, and implement a resulting action
program, acceptable to IDA, by March 31, 1997; (b) complete preparations of a national
redeployment plan consistent with the conclusions of the hospital sector study, by June 30, 1995,
and implement said plan by March 31, 1997; (c) ensure that each operating Health District, once
its Medical Center has been fiully upgraded with a Surgical Unit (CMA), has in place throughout
the duration of the project: (1) minimal personnel based upon norms defined in Decision No. 93-
304/SASF/SG  to staff the CMA and each of its constituent Health and Social Development
Centers (CSPS); (2) a District Health Plan for the district concerned; (3) a trained district health
team; (4) a financial accounting system for the CMA and each of its constituent CSPS responsible
for stocking and selling essential generic drugs; and (5) legal registration of community
management committees for the CMA concerned and for each of its constituent CSPS; (d) ensure
that the Procurement Center for Essential Generic Drugs (Centre d'approvisionnement des
medicaments essentiels generiques or CAMEG) meets the performance criteria which were agreed
upon between IDA and the Government and are incorporated in the Letter of Sector Policy,
throughout the life of the project; (e) integrate micronutrients in the algorithms, supervision
manuals, training curricula for the health district teams, patient cards, and ongoing training
sessions of Maternal and Child Health and the Expanded Program on Immunization services by
October 31, 1994; (f provide a detailed implementation plan of the micronutrient component for
the first year of the project by the Project Launch Workshop; (g) conduct a feasibility study, prior
to the project launch workshop, concerning the promotion of the importation of iodized salt; (h)
based on the results of the feasibility study, take actions to promote the importation of iodized
salt according to WHO standards and implement appropriate legal regulations thereto by March
31, 1996; (i) complete a national prevalence survey on dracunculiasis by July 31, 1995; 0)
complete a survey of ongoing external financing in the health sector in Burkina Faso by July
1995, and implement a monitoring, coordination, and evaluation system for such support by July
31, 1996; (k) ensure that the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) functions according to terms of
reference acceptable to IDA and not recruit any key staff of the PCU without the prior consent
of IDA; (1) ensure that a budget and deposit account in a commercial bank in Ouagadougou is
arranged by January 1, 1996, with an initial amount of US$100,000 deposited to meet
expenditures under the project (the remainder to be deposited in subsequent quarters in advance);
(m) following the results of the mid-term review, prepare and implement an action plan which
is acceptable to IDA for further implementation of the project; and (n) submit to IDA annual
audit reports, of reasonable scope and detail, within six months of the end of each fiscal year,
and, in the case of SOEs, semi-annual reports shall be submitted within three months after the
end of each audit period.

12.           As a condition of Board presentation, the Government adopted the approved letter
of sector development poli;.y and an accompanying action plan, including quantitative, annual
targets for the 1995-2000 period. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government agreed
to: (i) sign the Government-UNICEF Agreement regarding components to promote staff
development and decentralize the health system in order to promote the distribution and cost-
recovery of essential, generic drugs, and to reduce micronutrient deficiencies, (ii) sign the
contract with Faso Baara for the management of civil works financed under the project, (iii)
ersure that the PCU is fully operational, with the Director and two professional staff in their
posts, (iv) recruit a qualified accounting company, acceptable to IDA, experienced in working
according to international accounting standards, and (v) appoint an independent auditor under a
multi-year contract, with terms of reference, acceptable to IDA.
13.           Environmental Aspects. T'his is a category C project. Improved coverage and
quality of basic health care services will have a positive impact on the environment through
increased provision of family planning services, and its expected effect on pcpulation growth.
Other components, such as devolution, woula also have a positive impact on the environment.
One possible concern is how the district health facilities dispose of medical waste. This is an
issue which wiil be explicitly addressed in the training of, and supervision by, the district medical
teams.
14.           Program Obiective Categories. The project responds primarily to the country's
antipoverty and human resource development strategies by addressing largely the rural poor, and
in particular groups that have traditionally been marginalized such as women and children.
15.           Project Benefits.  By reversing present trends of low CSPS utilization, the
project will address the basic needs of some of the poorest segments of the Burkinabe population,
improve the productivity of sectoral investments including those financed under the FHP, and
support the Government's efforts in establishing a more responsive decentralized health care
system. The health services component has been designed to directly benefit about 3 million
people (30% of Burkina Faso's population) who will gain access to quality health care. With
special attention to be paid to maternal and infant care, the project should have a major impact
on reducing inaternal and infant mortality rates. The project's emphasis on substituting expensive
brand-name drugs with low cost generic drugs will both benefit patients by reducing their
financial burden during sickness episodes, and also make possible the introduction of cost
recovery, wvhich would provide the Government with additional revenue required for more
efficient functioning of health services at all levels of the system. Short supplies of drugs have
been one of the major problems of the present CSPS system, which has led to the underutilization
of basic health facilities. Stocking the CSPS with essential generic drugs coupled with instituting
cost-recovery would help overcome this major problem. It is also expected that community
participation in the management of the CSPS would greatly enhance the population's trust in the
reorganized health care system.
16.           Provision of additional surgical facilities at the district level should contribute to
more immediate medical/surgical interventions in emergency cases, and at the same time, reduce
the overcrowding at the Regional and National Hospitals. Training of general practitioners in
abdominal surgery would break an existing bottleneck by increasing the supply of doctors capable
of performing acute abdominal surgeries such as appendectomies. Additional training of doctors
at the district level would improve their skills in coping with increased supervision of the CSPS,
thus assuring improved performance of the basic level health facilities in the new decentralized
health care system.



6
17.          The nutrition component would be a major complement to the IDA-financed Food
Security and Nutrition Project (Credit 2414-BUR) by providing supplies of necessary
micronutrients to the diet. In particular, high rates of anemia among expectant mothers leading
to low birthweights will be reduced due to supplementary iron to be administered during pre-natal
care. Dispensing of iodine and vitamin A should greatly reduce incidences of iodine deficiency
and vitamin A deficiency caused blindness and death. A feasibility study to be financed by
UNICEF under the project should lead to actions to promote the importation of iodized salt.
18.           [he endemic parasitic disease control component would contribute to sustai,ling
the success of the OCP. Possible reintroduction of onchocerciasis through immigrants settling
in the oncho-freed areas would be prevented through the devolution component's control system.
Simultaneously, similar controls should make it impossible for new outbreaks of trypanosomiasis
to occur. Through these measures, seven million Burkinabe would remain protected from any
recurrence of onchocerciasis. And about 17% (43,000 km2) of Burkina's agricultural lands--with
relatively fertile soils--would remain safe for agricultural production.
19.          Through improved surveillance and education of the population, substantial
reductions in the incidence of dracunculiasis would be achieved. Although dracunculiasis is not
a mortal disease, it leads to economic losses due to absence from work and/or school. Official
estimates, based on village surveys, indicate that about 34% of the villages in Burkina are
afflicted by dracunculiasis. Preventive action taken under the project would reduce the incidence
of dracunculiasis considerably and make a substantial contribution to worker productivity in the
rural areas. The estimated economic loss avoided through eradication would be a miniYnum of
US$3 million per annum.
20.           Project Risks. The project faces three major risks. The first risk is that the
expected procurement of essential generic drugs and their distribution may be slow to materialize.
The Government has approved the required legislation and, with Bank assistance, established
CAMEG, an organization likely to undertake imports and distribution more efficiently than its
predecessor, SONAPHARM, since CAMEG would be freer from the influence of the Burkinabe
pharmaceutical lobby. The Government has provided assurances that it will operate CAMEG in
compliance with "satisfactory performance" criteria as defined jointly by ,ne Government and the
Bank during negotiations. Supervision during the first half of the project will focus heavily on
ensuring satisfactory cost-recovery and a continuous supply of essential drugs at the district level.
The second risk is the resistance to redeploying doctors and other health staff to rural areas and
ensuring that they remain there in order to fulfill their assigned responsibilities. This risk has
begun to be addressed through implementation of the redeployment action plan. The third risk
is the time required for regaining the confidence of the population in the CSPS especially in light
of the proposed cost recovery scheme and the recent devaluation of the CFA franc. Special
attention needs to be paid to the level and pace of implementing cost assessment so as not to
prevent people from seeking help at the primary level of the health care system. This last concern
is closely linked to the first, i.e. the widespread availability of low cost generic drugs.
21.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
