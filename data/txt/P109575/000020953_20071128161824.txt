Summary of Land Acquisition & Resettlement Policy Framework 
JAMAICA: JM Hurricane Dean ERL Project
 
A. Introduction 
No land acquisition or involuntary resettlement is comtemplated under the Project. Nonetheless, 
the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework summarized below applies to all JSIF-
funded community projects.  For JSIF-funded community projects, the Policy Framework will 
supplement existing Jamaican law pertaining to land acquisition and resettlement (the Land 
Acquisition Act of 1947) by introducing additional compensation measures to achieve 
compensation at replacement cost and income restoration together with implementation and 
consultation arrangements to minimize land acquisition impacts and obtain the informed consent 
of those affected by land acquisition.   
 
JSIF has prepared a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework (LARPF), which 
establishes equivalence with the objectives and operational principles in OP 4.00 and OP/BP 
4.12. The LARPF has been reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank and was approved by the 
JSIF Board on January 25, 2006.  The framework was also disclosed by the Bank though the 
InfoShop on February 6, 2006 and has been made publicly available in-country by the client.
1
The final EMF is also included as part of the JSIF Operations Manual. A complete Policy 
Framework has been incorporated into the JSIF Operations Manual.  
 
JSIF-funded community projects comprise a range of infrastructure investments including 
drinking water supply, sewerage, sanitation, storm drainage, small roads, school buildings, and 
community and recreation facilities.   
 
Since the land acquisition impacts deriving from these community projects will be minor, the 
appropriate instrument to manage such impacts shall be an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan 
attached as an annex to the project proposal/plan agreed between the community and JSIF.  If 
land acquisition under a community project causes displacement, the Abbreviated Resettlement 
Plan shall include economic rehabilitation measures.   
 
B. Means
 of Obtaining Land 
The infrastructure investments undertaken in JSIF-financed community based projects are for the 
most part located within and identified by the beneficiary communities, which implies that access 
to land may be obtained through other means than just land acquisition through eminent domain.  
Thus, land for different investment components in a community project could be obtained though 
one or a combination of the different means listed below.  While all of these means of obtaining 
land would require documentation, not all would necessitate payment of compensation and/or 
provision of relocation and rehabilitation assistance.  However, in all cases, care shall be taken to 
ensure that the persons involved are fully informed about the project, about the avenues for 
grievance redress, and confirm that the donation or long-term lease is voluntary.  This 
information is provided during the consultations that take place as part of the participatory 
community project preparation process.

In-country disclosure has been done through publication on the JSIF website 
(http://www.jsif.org/inner_city_basic_serv.asp).

C. Community Project Preparation, Consultation, and Land Acquisition Planning
 
Given that the persons potentially affected by land acquisition and displacement in JSIF-financed 
community-based projects are in most cases also project beneficiaries with a voice in decision 
making on both the type of investments and technical alternatives, there is a strong incentive to 
seek solutions that avoid or reduce adverse impacts from land acquisition.  During the 
community-based participatory project preparation process, consultation on technical options will 
involve a concurrent assessment of potential associated land acquisition impacts as described in 
the table below. This will facilitate an early and ongoing identification of feasible technical 
design alternatives to avoid or minimize such impacts, and will also enable consultation with 
persons affected by land acquisition to obtain their consent regarding mitigation measures.

D. Institutional
 Arrangements 
The overall responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of the Land Acquisition & 
Resettlement Policy Framework rests with JSIF.  Within JSIF, there shall be an Environment & 
Resettlement Officer and a Legal Officer.   
 
Acquisition of the land required for a particular community project will be undertaken by the 
Commissioner of Land based on information and documentation provided by JSIF. Valuation of 
the assets to be acquired will be conducted by the Land Valuation Division of the National Land 
Agency.

Grievance redress will be pursued at different levels (community, JSIF, specialized arbitration 
institutions) with recourse to the courts as the last option for 
the aggrieved party
.
E. Monitoring
 Arrangements 
For each community project, information on land requirements and the means of obtaining any 
land required by a particular project component will be recorded in the MIS for different stages of 
the project cycle: 
 
Community Project Cycle 
Data for MIS 
Project Application 
·
Estimated need for land for specific investment 
components; 
·
Means of obtaining such land (donation, govt. 
land, purchase, land acquisition); and 
·
Scale of resettlement, if any. 
Review of Application 
·
Approval; or 
·
Rejection (> 10 families to be resettled) 
Project Concept Development and 
JSIF Technical & Social Review 
·
Community consultations (date, # of participants 
including potential PAPs, issues); and 
·
Documentation provided on voluntary land 
donations and transfer of unused government land. 
Abbreviated Resettlement Plan 
·
Data from census with inventory of assets lost by 
PAPs, entitlements, and socio-economic data; 
·
Dates of receipt, review, and approval by JSIF of 
ARP; 
·
Dates of submission and approval by Bank of ARP 
(for Bank assisted projects); and 
·
Date of disclosure of ARP.  
Implementation 
·
Delivery of compensation and rehabilitation 
entitlements as per ARP; and 
·
Data on grievance redress  
Post-implementation 
·
Evaluation including assessment of economic 
rehabilitation/income restoration. 
Each Abbreviated Resettlement Plan will establish a baseline through the census of PAPs which 
will comprise socio-economic data, the inventory of assets lost, and the compensation and 
resettlement benefits awarded to the PAPs.  Progress monitoring by JSIF will record the timely 
provision of compensation to PAPs (whether provided before or after possession was taken of the 
asset), and the timely provision of resettlement assistance.  
The data will be entered into JSIF’s 
MIS together with information on land provided through voluntary donations, nominal long-term 
leases, and vacant government land.  An evaluation will be undertaken to establish whether the 
objective of the measures to mitigate the land acquisition and resettlement impacts have been 
achieved, namely, whether PAPs affected by land acquisition and resettlement have been able to 
improve, or at least restore, their livelihoods and standards of living to pre-displacement levels.  
Data on grievance redress will also be entered in the MIS and summarized in status reports. 
 
For projects assisted by the World Bank, periodic supervision will assess whether the 
implementation is in compliance with the provisions in approved Abbreviated Resettlement 
Plans.

The project will refurbish the existing sewer network, which will be connected to a sewage treatment facility to be funded 
from other sources.  Since the two activities are linked, the access to land for the treatment facility needs to be clarified.

The Community Center will be located on a piece of land presently used in part as a community sports/play-ground, and in 
part as residential area by squatters.  At the consultation on JSIF’s Policy Framework on January 13, 2006, community members were 
of the opinion that the Community Center could be constructed on the site without disturbing the squatter settlement or the 
sports/play-ground.

During a Bank team field visit to the Flankers’ neighborhood on January 12, 2006, it was found that the planned 
rehabilitation and extension of a storm drain from Providence Heights in Hog City would require at least temporary relocation of 3 
squatter houses built on the bank and partly over the gully.  An assessment of the need for temporary or permanent relocation needs to 
be made as part of the finalization of the community plan for Flankers, and if required, the plan needs to be amended with resettlement 
mitigation measures.

Road rehabilitation will require minor realignment and shifting of a fence.
