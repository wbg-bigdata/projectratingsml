1. Introduction
This environmental protection action plan is prepared to implement the
environmental protection measures set forth in the "Statement of Environmental
Impact Assessment for the National Road Project III in Hubei Province", to prevent or
mitigate the negative impact caused by the project.
This action plan is made based on the features and concrete situations of the
construction project as well as the reference materials provided by the World Bank.
1.1 Main conclusions of the EIA report
(1) Air
The current status of the air quality along the proposed road area is fairy good,
with the concentrations of NOx, CO below the class II air quality standard level limit.
The concentration of TSP is also below the standard level limit, except for that at
individual sensitive spot (Liuwan Primary School).
After the proposed road put into operation, the measured concentration of CO
along the areas within a distance of 200 m from the road, in the short term (by the
year of 2000), the mid term (by the year of 2010), and the long term (by the year of
2020), are below the standard level limit. The concentration of NOx will be below the
standard level limit in the short term; in the mid and long term, the concentration of
NOx will also be below the standard level limit except that at the Jinkou
Pharmaceutical Factory, Baoxie, Liuhuan Primary School and Xinfu Primary School,
which will be over the standard limits.
(2) Noise
Investigations show that the current status of the acoustic environrent along the
proposed road area is good, with both of the daytime and nighttime noise level below
the standard level limit.
After the proposed road put into operation, the noise level will be over the
standard level limit in different extent for the main route 21% of the 14 sensitive spots
in daytime, for 79% of the 14 sensitive spots at nightime by the year of 2000; the
noise level will be over the standard level limit in diff rent extent for the main route
21% of the 14 sensitive spots in daytime, for 93% of the 14 sensitive spots at
nighttime by the year of 2010; the noise level will be over the standard level limit in
different extent for the main route 43% of the 14 sensitive spots in daytime, for 93%
of the 14 sensitive spots at nighttime by the year of 2020. The noise level will be
slightly over the standard level limit for 3 of the 6 sensitive spots of the connection
road by the year of 2020.
(3) Ecological environment
According to the survey along the proposed road area, the surface water quality,
land use, vegetation, farmland soil, growth of the crops are in good condition. In the



area within 500 meters from both sides of the road, no rare animal or plant lawfully
protected by the state has been found.
The construction of the proposed road will last 3.5 years, with several rainy
seasons. A total of 2146900 m3 earth and stone work will have to conducted in the
construction period for the subgrade construction, with great amount of cutting and
filling as well as the ground base treatment for some road sections. Therefore the
surface vegetation damage, landform transformation and more soil erosion will be
inevitable during the construction period.
The land occupation for the road includes the subgrade, earth borrowing site,
spoil area, and other temporary occupation area, therefore, there will be impact on the
farm land crops.
In the road construction period the impact on the surface water mainly arises from
bridge construction, including the impact on river water quality caused by the bridge
substructure construction and the sewage from the labour camp.
The impact on the ecological environment during the operation period mainly
comes from the vehicle emission of lead. The impact of the flying dust on the crops
will be small due to the fact that the area is abundant of rainfall, usually heavy and
long lasting raining. The analysis and forecast of the lead pollutant content in the soil
show that by the year of 2020, the lead pollutant in the soil on both sides of the
assessed road area caused by the vehicle emission will be far less than the critical
content level for the soil to bear.
As mentioned above, the major environmental impact caused by the proposed
road project includes the noise impact on the noise sensitive areas of Xinfu Primary
School, Liuhuan Primary School, Hanyang No. 3 Second School, Liuwan Primary
School and several other resident areas in the short term, mid term, and long term of
operation period; and the air impact on the air quality sensitive areas of Jinkou
Medical Plant, Baoxie, and Liuhuan Primary School in the mid and long term
operation period.

2. Environmental Protection Management Program
2.1 Environmental protection program in the project feasibility study stage
The main environmental protection work in this stage is the EIA work for the
construction project.
Entrusted by Hubei Provincial Communications Planning and Design Institute,
the Environmental Engineering Design and Research Division of the Research
Institute of Highway (RIOH) of the Ministry of Communications undertook the
environmental assessment study for this project. In March, 1994, the RIOH completed
the "Terms of Reference of the EIA for the Motorway Engineering of Hubei section
of Beijing-Zhuhai national trunk road", which was approved by the NEPA on 7th
October, 1994. Therefore the "EIA Report on the Project of Northern Section of
Beijing-Zhuhai National Trunk Road in Hubei Province" was completed in October
1995. Preliminary examination of the "EIA Report on the National Road Project III in
Hubei Province" was accomplished on 4th March 1996 by the MOC.
2.2 Environmental protection program in the project engineering design stage
To carry out the environmental protection measures set forth in the EIA report, to
prevent and mitigate the potential negative environmental impact arising from the
project, this environmental protection action plan is specially prepared.
The main purpose of the environmental protection management during the
engineering design period is as follows.
2.2.1 Road design  h¢  f,t
Road alignment sholed be selected taking into consideration of the overall natural
and socio-economic environment of the areas along the proposed road, so as to
prevent or mitigate the pollution and damage to the ecological environment caused by
the road project. Therefore the following principles should be observed in the road
design:
(1) Road design should be harmonized with landform, with reasonable land use
and less farmland occupation as much as possible.
(2) Road should be away from the drinking water sources.
(3) Road should be away from cultural and historical relics and the scenic spots.
(4) Road should be away from city, town and densely populated areas as far as
possible.
(5) Great importance should be attached to geological survey, to provide reliable
basis for engineering design, particularly for the soft soil ground base treatment, so as
to prevent the negative environmental impact caused by the unexpected road distress
from being occurred later on.
6



(6) Pay attention to the selection of earth borrowing site and spoil area, by taking
into account of water and soil conservation and other environmental impact.
(7) Careful design of the underpasses, so as to reduce the partition impact caused
by the road and to provide convenience for the local people.
(8) To stabilize the subgrade, motar slab combined with grass or totally covered
grass slope should be used to protect the filled side slope. For the cut side slope,
shotcrete, motar slab, etc. surfacing technology can be used for protection. Subgrade
protection can be done together with the engineering work and implemented by time
schedule.
(9) Transition slab should be provided between the approach road and the bridge
to make joint smooth so as to reduce vibration and noise caused by the joint.
(10) Protection forest belt should be planted along the air quality sensitive areas.
2.2.2 Attach great importance to drainage system
(1) Complete and perfect drainage system should be provided in road design. The
pavement run-off and the surrounding surface run-off should be discharged to
specifically designed area, other than the drinking water sources or fish ponds.
(2) The run-off from the bridge deck should be collected by pipes and discharged
to the road side ditches, other than the river.
(3) If there is any damage to the original drainage system due to the new road
construction, proper treatment or rehabilitation should be made to prevent any
negative impact.                                          I
ftiq c t(4(,          /S   (  4     Se      6-f
(4) Attach great importanceA"the draina syst   esign and the sewage
treatment for the 4 service areas and the  road maintenance  cuidings, to make the
sewage discharged to the loca sewage s stem as far as possible, otherwise it should
be considered to set up an independent sewage treatment and purification system
before discharging.            /
(5) To prevent water     on caused by the pollutants spillage from road
accident in some1 sensitive areas it is necessary to build anti-collision structures,
special design for the drainage system, or sewage filter, so that once accident happens
the pollutant can be cutoff to prevent the water sources from being polluted.
2.2.3 Impact of the bridge and culvert design on hydrology
The opening, clearance, as well as the filling height of the bridge head should be
designed based on hydrologic calculation, flood control and navigation condition
requirement.
7



For the bridges and culverts in connection with farmland irrigation system, flood
discharge should be considered in the design to prevent the farm land from being
damaged.
The designed flood discharge capacity for the bridges and culverts along the route
of this road project is higher than the local flood control standard, without any
negative impact on the hydrologic conditions.
2.2.4 Road management control areas along both sides of the road
According to the provisions set by the Hubei provincial people's government,
Jhrc road management control areas will be set up by both sides of the road. Within
the road management control areas it is not allowed for any buildings to be built, if
buildings such as power supply, water supply, gas supply and telecommunication
facilities are to be built in the area, it should be applied and got to be approved before
hand. The set up of the road management control area has good effect in
environmental protection.
2.2.5 The environmental management target of the engineering design
The above mentioned measures have been included in the engineering design. A
total of 340 underpasses, 16 pedestrian overpasses and aqueducts have been designed
with all their locations being decided based on local area public inquiry and approval
of the local government.
The location and layout of the building materials worksite for the engineering
work are shown in Fig. 2-2-1.
Earth materials used for subgrade and pavement: There are enough earth
materials for subgrade and pavement use for all the road sections except for that at the
East-West lake area. The road passes through the hilly area with terrain fluctuations,
which requires balanced cutting and filling work. The earth materials' in the hilly areas
are sandy or clayey with good physical performance to meet with road engineering
requirement. In the light hilly and plain area, however, the earth quality is poor for
engineering work with high level of water content due to the rich underground water
resource and high level of the water table. So special treatment will be necessary for
the local earth materials, or the earth from the nearby areas will have to be transported
for the road section.
Sand: The area is rich in sand resource mainly distributed alongside the Huanshui
river, Shawo river and Sheshui river, with good quality and many varieties. It is easy
to get with good transport conditions.
Stones: Stone materials are distributed in the area along both sides of the road,
with the main quarry site including Sigudun, Fangfanzhen and Xiaohezhen in Dawu

4. Environmental Monitoring Program
4.1 Purpose
The environmental impact during the construction period mainly includes water
pollution caused by the wastes and sewage, noises from the construction machines,
water and soil erosion caused by earth and stone cutting and filling, flying dusts and
bitumen smoke from the mixing plants, and other pollutants. In the operation period
the emissions from the traffic vehicles will be the main source of pollution. In
addition, contingent pollution accident rmay have serious impact on the environment.
Therefore it is necessary to understand the environmnent conditions and development
trend to improve environmental management service, through environmental
monitoring program.
4.2 Organization
In the road construction and operation periods the Environmental Protection
Office of the         l Communications Department, the Environmental Protection
Office of thHNBd    its subordinates will be responsible for the environmental
monitoring woIHlong the whole route.
4.3 Implementation of conventional environmental monitor work
Conventional monitor work will be carried out by qualified monitor unit under
the HPCD, accoreding to the monitor plan, with the details shown inTable 4-3-1.
