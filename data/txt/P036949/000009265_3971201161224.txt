CHAPTER 1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION
1. Background
National road project III in Hubei province is part of the "Two Longitudinal and
Two Lateral" national trunk roads, which shall be built by the year of 2000 planned by
the State Council. Hubei Provincial Communications Department commissioned the
desk study on Hubei section of Beijing-Zhuhai national trunk road in December 1992.
Therefore, in November 1993 Hubei Provincial Communications Planning and
Design Institute (HPCPDI) completed the pre-feasibility study report of Hubei section
of Beijing-Zhuhai national trunk road. In December 1993, Hubei Provincial Planning
Commission and Hubei Provincial Communications Department submitted the
proposal of the project to the State Planning Commission. In September 1995,
additional report concerning with the two sections of the Shanhai-Chengdu national
trunk road was submitted.
Entrusted by Hubei Provincial High-grade Highway Management Bureau
(HPHHMB) on March 8,1994, the HPCPDI asked the Research Institute of Highway
(RIOH) of the Ministry of Communications (MOC) to undertake the environmental
assessment study for this project on March 10, 1994. In March 1994, with the
assistance from HPCPDI and Wuhan Municipal Highway Division, the engineers
from RIOH conducted survey and investigation on the whole road section and solicit
opinions from the commission unit, which forms the basis of the terms of reference
for environmental impact assessment for this project.
On October 7, 1994, the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA)
gave an official reply on the Terms of Reference for Environmental Impact
Assessment for Jiuliguan-Junshan Motorway, the Northem Section of Beijing-Zhuhai
national trunk road in Hubei province after which the RIOH started the EIA work.
Through analysis and assessment of the environmental impact of this engineering
construction project, it is expected to achieve the following results: to approve the
rationality of the route selection plan in terms of the environment protection; to
propose reasonable measures for environmental protection and to feed back to the
engineering design and construction in order to provide a scientific basis for
optimization of engineering design; to provide scientific and technical consultant
service for the environmental protection and management.

3. Assessment Scope
The assessment scope of the project is within the area of 200 meters from both
sides along the central line of the proposed road. The assessment scope of the social
economic development, living standard, ecology environment and the pollutant source
shall be in a properly extended areas, up to 500 meters.
4. Environmental Control and Protection Target
4.1 Protection of ecological environment along the road area
Through assessment of such environmental impact as soil erosion, vegetation
destruction, flying dust caused by earth cutting, recommendations optimized road
design; reasonable engineering construction and land occupation, feasible prevention
and mitigation measures as well as vegetation recovery and remedy measures shall be
proposed to materialize the target.
4.2 Protection of local residents' health and sustain normal everyday life
The target shall be realized through management and control of the traffic noise
and vehicle emissions, well arranged resettlement and relocation compensation,
2



5. Assessment Method
Road construction project is a kind of linear development project. On-site
investigation shows that the environmental conditions of most road sections along the
proposed route are similar, except for a few areas being more environmentally
sensitive. Therefore, the EIA method adopted is based on typical sensitive points
representing one road section, combining points with lines to get the whole picture of
the assessment area. According to the forecast of the environmental impact on the
sensitive points or sections, correspondent mitigation measures are proposed to
control the negative impact to the minimum possible.
Theoretical models shall be used to calculate the traffic noise, air pollution,
vibration impact in the assessment. Socio-economic and aquatic ecological
assessment shall be made mainly through investigations and analyses.

3. Geographical Position
The area along the proposed road is situated in the eastern part of Hubei province
and in the middle reaches of the Yangtze river near the eastern border of Jianghan
plain, with Huanggang area adjacent to its east, Jingzhou and Xiangfan bordering on
its west, Xinyang region Henan province on its north. In the south across the Yangtze
river it is connected with Xiangning region, which is the "joint area" linking not only
the south and the north, but also the east and the west of Hubei province.
The terrain of this area is higher in the north than that in the south, with Dabie
and Tongbai Mountain in the north, connecting with Damnufu Mountain in the south.
Wuhan city and part of Xiaogan are located in Hanjiang plain area, with altitude
generally less than 50 m. The hilly areas are mainly in Dawu county. Most of Xiaogan
region are situated between the hills and the plain with altitude being generally less
than 200 m. The alignment of the road is principally along the roof of high ground and
plain platform with high altitude and little longitudinal fluctuations, while in alluvial
plain area the alignment is smooth.

CHAPTER 3 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT CONDITION AND
ASSESSMENT
1. Terrain and Landforms
The area, the proposed road passes through, is very vast with great terrain
variation. From Jiuliguan to Xiaohe village of Xiaochang is heavy hilly area; from
Fuhe to Junshan is plain lake area; with other areas being plain and light hilly.
There are_soft soils in this area, therefore 22.7 km of road section need to be
treated artificially. Meanwhile, the ground surface is characteristic of long time
temporary water accumulation with higher water table. The soil quality is poor with
higher water content. Therefore, soils for subgrade and pavement have to be
transported far away from other places, which makes the engineering construction
difficult and increases the cost.
The geologic condition of the road section in the north of Fuhe is quite good, and
so far no landslide, rock cracking and soft soil ground have been found in the area.   6".
The stratum from Jiuliguan to Huayuan is ancient with bedrock along this route being
shallowly buried, with outcropping rock seen everywhere. The stratum from Huayuan
to the north of Fuhe is dominated by middle and ancient time Pleistocene series with
hard soil texture. Along the route, the slope of the irrigation canals and ditches is not
only steep, but also stable with higher loading capacity. The good geologic conditions
provide reliable subgrade for the engineering work.
As for the road section from the south of Fuhe to Junshan, the low-lying land is
characteristic of short term deposit, soaked with surface water and underground water
for many years, so that the soil is soft with low bearing capacity; except for the
highland of Dushan, Hengshan, Zhashan, Junshan, etc. within Hanyang area being in
good geologic condition. Most soft soil are in the East-west lake area, where the soft
soil layer is thick and deep, and where the subgrade and bridge structure for the road
section have to be properly treated, or appropriate support structure selected. The
areas from Zhushan to Yongan and from Jinkou to Baoxie belong to denudation
depositional high plain area. Due to the action of surface laminar flow, the area is
characteristic of hilltops alternating with depressed ditches and branching streams. So
the average filling height of the subgrade will be 3.5 m - 4 m. The area along the
proposed road is in good geologic conditions, dominated by soil ground with few
stony section.
2. Meteorology and Hydrology
The affected area of this project is of middle and low latitude, belonging to the
tropical continental monsoon humid climate characteristic of clear four seasons, long
frost-free period, with plentiful heat and abundant water resources, warm and shiny as
8



well as rainy and hot season. The local climate in different areas, however, has its own
characteristics due to different terrain effect, such as lake water body effect,
depression and cool lake effect, mountain and slope effect and etc.. In spring the
weather changes easily, the temperature tends to go up rapidly with more rains,
sometimes it is cloudy and raining with very low temperature. The warm and cool air
replace each other alternatively, which causes more raining in spring. In surnmer, the
weather is warrm with plentiful rain and plum rains season so that the flood is easy to
happen. In midsummer, it is usually clear and hot, with hot and dry wind from south
occurring before or after slight Heat. In the fall, the temperature drops down quickly
with more clear weather and less raining, meanwhile, dry weather easily occurs. In
winter, it is very cold with few raining and often freeze with heavy wind and snow.
The annual average temperature is 15 IC - 17°C. Normally January is the coldest
with average temperature being 2 °C to 4.1 IC, the lowest - 13 °C and the extremely
lowest   -18 'C. Historical record shows that the Hanjiang river and the Yangtze
river froze several times. Particularly in Wuhan urban area, it is very hot in summer,
with atmospheric pressure of 751.43 mm Hg and the highest relative humidity up to
80% and the highest temperature up to 41.3 'C; therefore Wuhan is known as one of
the three "stoves" beside the Yangtze river.
The area abounds with rain, with annual rainfall of 1100 - 1450 mm. In terms of
rainfall distribution, it is increasing southwards, with rainfall isopleth distributed
latitudinally and the annual rainfall varies greatly from year to year, with record high
up to 2262 mm and record low down to 657.1 mm. Rainfall variation between seasons
is also great, with summer rainfall accounting for 36% - 45% over 430 - 530 mm,
spring rainfall accounting for 29% - 36% over 330 -490 mm, autumn rainfall
accounting for 17.% - 19% over 100 - 240 mm, winter rainfall accounting for 8% -
i i% over 90 - 160 mm.
According to the statistics, the highest wind speed in the area is 29.6 m/s (January
27, 1976), from the north-west with strongest wind force up to 4th scale, and with
most heavy wind in April, least in September and October. North wind prevails across
the year, except in June and July with wind from south sea, which is characteristic of
high speed and lasting with longest duration up to 16 days.
The area is abundant in surface water, with crisscross rivers and lakes, reservoirs
and ponds spread all over the area, with much run-off and transit flow. The Yangtze
river passes through the area from the south-west to the north-east, the Hanjiang river
converges into the Yangtze from the north-west to the south-east. There are branch
rivers of Dongjin river, Huanshui river, Fuhe river, Lunhe river, converging into the
Yangtze river and the Hanjiang river. The rivers and lakes for the proposed road
passing through and by include Huanshui river, Fuhe river, Lunhe river, Wild Pig lake,
Wangmu lake, Hanjiang river, Tongsum river, Yangtze river, etc..
9



The area for the proposed road passing through is located in the east of Hubei
province and Jianghan plain characteristic of heavy rainfall and serious flood in some
heavy hilly areas. Drainage and protection measures have been considered in subgrade
and pavement design and construction.

3.2 Current vegetation status investigation and assessment
Grain crops in the area along the proposed road mainly are rice, wheat, barley,
beans and the others; cash crops mainly are cotton, rape, sesame, peanut and tobacco.
In addition there are certain amount of tea, mulberry, fruit and vegetable along the
area.
On the whole the area has rich plant resources, but differences do exist between
areas along different road sections, i.e. some areas with well grown vegetation, some
bad.
3.3 Agricultural soil pollution investigation and assessment
3.3.1 Principles of agricultural soil pollution survey point disposition
Since in the area along the proposed road most lands have been cultivated for
10



agricultural use for a long time. The proposed road is a new road, which shall occupy
farm land definitely. Therefore, only farmland soil is considered while soil condition
survey points being disposed. First, the representativeness of the soil samnpling should
be considered; secondary, scattered distribution of sampling should be considered; in
addition, terrain features have to be considered in sampling.
3.3.2 Survey results of agricultural condition
Farmland soil survey items analysis method and results are shown in Table 3-2.

3.3.3 Current condition assessment of agricultural soil
T he background value of organic matter in the cultivated soil in Hubei province is
0.37 - 12.33%, with its geometric average being 2.3%. In the light of the survey, the
content of organic matter in farmland soil along the proposed road is slightly less than
the provincial average in Hubei. Only in terms of content of organic matter, the
fertility of soil is at the mid lower level. Therefore, attention should be paid to using
more organic fertilizer. The measured PH of the soil is over 6.85 - 7.52, which is
neutral suitable for the crop growing. The measured Pb content in the soil is close to
the provincial geometric average in Hubei province. Table 3-3 shows the statistical
analysis results of the background Pb content in the soil.

Source: Chinese Soil Element Background Value, China Environmental Science Publishing House, 1991
Single index method is used for the current condition assessment of lead content
in the soil, with formula as follows:
P=C/S
where: P - pollution assessment index;
C - actual measured content (mg/kg);
S - selected standard content for assessment (mg/kg);
II



Since no assessment standard content for heavy metal in soil has been issued in
China, the standard content recommended by the "Specifications for Road
Construction Environmental Impact Assessment (Draft)" is adopted, i.e. the geometric
average of the background content of Pb in the A layer soil in Hubei province
multiplied by the geometric standard deviation, with formula as follows.
B = MD2
where: B - assessment standard content;
M - geometric average content of Pb in the A layer soil in Hubei province
(mg/kg);
D - standard deviation for geometric average content of Pb in the A layer soil in
Hubei province.
The calculated assessment standard Pb content in the soil is 43.43 mg/kg.
The soil environmental Pb content depends on PH value of the soil. 200 mg/kg is
taken as the critical Pb content when the PH value is less than 6.5; and 300 mg/kg is
taken as the critical content when the PH value is greater than 6.5. The current
condition survey shows that the PH value of the soil along the proposed road is
i greater than 6.5, therefore, the critical Pb content taken is 300 mg/kg.
The classification of Pb pollution in the soil is shown in Table 3-4.
Table 34 Classification of Pb pollution in the soil
Classification  Non-pollution   | Slight pollution    Medium pollution   Serious pollution
Index P          51.0           1.0- 2.5   1     2.5 -7.0          Ž 7.0
Source: Specifications for Highway Construction Environmental Impact Assessment (Draft)
The assessment of current status of Pb content in the soil of the area is
summarized in Table 3-5.
Table 3-5 Current status of Pb content in the soil of the area
Place sampled  Daxindian |  Dawu  | Sancha  | Dabati   Dingiatai  Shenshan    Baoxie
Index P     0.58      0.59      0.46       0.64      0.65      0.52       0.46
It can be seen from Table 3-5 that Pb pollution index P is less than 1.0 for all the
places sampled. Comparison of the index P with that in Table 3-4 shows that the Pb
pollution in the soil along the proposed road is of "non-pollution" class. The lead
content in the soil is ten times less than the critical content of 300 mg/kg.
3.4 Current condition investigation and assessment of crops
Due to great differences in terrain and climate conditions from the north to the
south along the proposed road area, the agricultural resources from the north to the
south are different accordingly. The resources, however, are very rich with all the
varieties. Comparing with that of the southern area of the province with better
conditions for agriculture, the output the crops in the north are obviously lower,
especially in the hilly dry area. Another problem in the north area about agricultural
12



production is the low efficient of the land use with high cost, e.g. in Dawu some
farmlands have not been fully developed and utilized yet.
3.5 Current condition investigation and assessment of soil erosion
On-the-spot investigation shows that soil erosion is very serious in Dawu area,
with soil erosion module being about 5500 ton/(km2-year), comparing the acceptable
module over 2500 - 5000 ton/(km2-year) and with area of soil erosion accounting for
about 25% of the total. The major reasons are: firstly, the terrain of this area is
dominated by hilly areas, most of which are in the form of short strip ridges
vulnerable to water flow action, especially after the vegetation having been destroyed;
secondly, due to great proportions of loose soft parent materials most in yellow-brown
vulnerable to erosion; thirdly, the area saw more and more cultivated and reclaimed
land, particularly at mountain slopes and in the forest by labour intensive farming
easy to cause soil erosion. By comparison, in areas of Caidian, Jiangxia and East-West
lake along the proposed road, the soil erosion is less serious, with average erosion
module about 1000 ton/(kin2-year), and the erosion area accounting for about 5% of
the total, the terrain of which is a kind of transition area from alluvial and deposit
plain to hilly lake plain area. In the area, the soil erosion mainly happens in the mature
soil zone formed through cultivation on alluvial deposit and deposit parent materials
with features of strong acidity, high viscidity, thick -soil layer, dense texture, poor
pervious function and poor anti-erosion capability, suitable for such trees as tea-oil
tree and pine tree. In this region, formed by modem time river alluvial materials and
lake deposit the soil is vulnerable to erosion, but the soil is fertile with well grown
vegetation and less soil erosion.
3.6 Current status investigation of rare animals plants and nature reserve area
The area along the proposed road is rich in animal and plant resources.
Investigation shows that the animals frequently seen include mountain badger, yellow
weasel, wolf, raccoon dog, fox, deer, squirrel, hedgehog, wild pig, owl, kite, ring-
necked pheasant, turtledove, woodpecker, big cuckoo, cuckoo with four tones, myna,
magpie, gray magpie, crow, wild duck, swallow, and parietal duck etc.. There are pigs,
cows, sheep, rabbits and Equus animals as well as chickens, ducks, gooses along the
road area. The coverage rate of forest along the proposed road area is very high; the
grain crops mainly are rice and wheat, the cash crops mainly are peanut, sesame, rape,
cotton and etc.. The area along the proposed road, is also rich in herbal medicine
resources, such as, the root of ballon flower, Chinese atractylodes, fuling and etc. The
mature timber along the proposed road is dominated by masson pine and China fur.
There are rich grassland resources mainly with arbor family as well as the composite
family and the pulse family herbage.
The proposed road shall not pass through any natural preservation area of the
state and the Hubei provincial level. No precious wild animals and plants of the state
conservative species have been found within the areas of 500 m from both sides of the
proposed road.

Liujiawan, Xujiawan, Shangtianwan, Liujiachong, Wangjiawan, Sitangwan,
Yangpingzhen, Wangjiadun, Yanjiaqiao, Guanyinyan, Lilindian, Zhaojiahe,
Lijiaxiang and etc.. The city of Dawu county is a densely populated area passed by the
road, with middle schools and primary schools, of which the Liuwan primary school
is only_j  mLawayfothe proposed ro1ad, and the Erlang middle school 600 m from
the interchange. The heavy hilly features of the Dawu county area make the cutting
and filling greatly affected by the terrain conditions as well as by that of the buildings.
So the road alignment is finalized in such a way that the minimum height of cutting
and filling for the subgrade near buildings being limited at about 3 m.
The Xiaogan city (including Xiaochang county and Xiaonan district) has a total
area of 2216 Ian2 and population 1.3346 million. The v   of Xiaowu and 
Xiaoheguan In Xiaochang are densely populated, being abou. l00m 'away from the
proposed road. The Xiaochang county area is hilly with moderate undulation and
relatively balanced cutting and filling of average filling height for the subgrade at
about3 -4.5m.
In Xiaonan, the road passes through the mountain area between the Wangmu lake
and the Wild Pig lake via Yangdian, Chanchuanpu and Sanchazhen; across the Fuhe
river at Beijinzui via Yutan; then across the Lunhe river; entering into the East-West
lake area of Wuhan at the brickyard. The Pyzh n an village at Sanchazhen is a
densely populated area, being about 10Onim away from the proposed road, where near
the Sanchazhen a separate highway-railway grade crossing shall be built. The Xiaonan
district is an area of plain hilly, with average height of the subgrade for the road being
about 3.65 m.
In the East-West lake area, the road passes through the Zoumalin farm, crossing
with the national road 107 at Dabati, across the Hanjiang river at Dingjiatai, then
entering into Caidian area. The Jianguo village and Dingjiatai near Dabati are resident
area, only 50 m away from the proposed road.
In Caidian area the road passes through the resident areas of Hongguang village,
Quanli and Xiaojialing near the Dongjing river after across the Hanjiang river.
Hongguan         population over 300. Quanli is also densely populated only 50
m away from the proposed road with interchange. The Zhushan-Yongan connection
road starts from Zhusiian~ and ends at Yongan, via Zhangwan, Bianjiang Primary j | 5c
School, Liuhuan Primary School, and Xiaguancun village. The Bianjiang Primary
School is 150 m away from the proposed road; and the Liuhuan Primary School a two
story building, with over 400 students and 15 staffs, is only 60 m from the road. The
proposed road shall pass right through Xiaguangcun village with over 100 families
and population of 400. The East-West lake area and Caidian area are plain with low
14



terrain, and the average height of filling for the subgrade is about 4.75 m.
In Jiangxia area, the road passes through Jinkou, Shenshan, Yaojiazui,
Zengjiawan, Shenglicun, Xingfu  Primary  School, Xinwanli, Limiaocun, Xinwu,
Yangqiao, Sunluowan, Siwangcun, Zhaowangshan and Guijiawan then enters into
Biaoxie. The relatively densely populated area includes: Yaojiazui and Shenglicun
with farnilies over 30 - 50; the Xinfu Primary School a two story building with 300
more students in 9 classes, about 40 - 50 m away from the proposed road.

4.3 Current status assessment of noise environment along the proposed road
The proposed road is away from cities, and most of the areas passed through by
the road are the suburbs and villages, with more than 170 villages, and only a few
large scale resident areas with typical rural area features. 14 monitoring spots were
established along the road. The survey results show that all the spots surveyed are up
to the acoustic environmental quality standard, except for some spots in the non-
resident areas of the Dabati interchange and the separate highway-railway grade
crossing, with noise level over the standard limit (Dabati 91.2 dB(A) in the day time,
81.7 dB(A) at night; Sancha 79.8 dB(A) in the day time, 75.5 dB(A) at night).
The proposed road crosses with the national road 107 at Dabati, where the traffic
volume reached 480 - 1200 pcu/day during the survey, so this is the main reason why
the noise level exceeding the standard limit.
The proposed road crosses with the railway at Sancha, which is the main reason
why the noise level exceeding the standard limit. It is, however, below the standard
limit when there is no train passing by.
To sum up, the acoustic environment along the proposed road area are in good
condition, except for the two crossings with the national road 107 and the railway,
where the noise level is over the standard limit caused by the road and railway traffic.
Therefore, proper measures should be taken to keep the noise level as low as possible
to make the socio-economic development sustainable.
5. Current Status and Assessment of Air Environment
5.1 Current environment status investigation
Most areas along the proposed road are far away from air environment sensitive
areas, only a few places in Dawu being passed by and close to some road sections,
such as part of the county township area, Liuhuan Primary school, Xinfu Primary
School. Although the road passes through Wuhan city area, it is 18 km away from the
downtown area. There are by passed densely populated large areas, including the city
of Dawu county, Xiaohe township, Sancha township, etc., where no obvious industrial
pollution sources has been found during the on-the-spot investigation.
The air pollution factors (daily average) got from air environment survey for the
city of Dawu county in 1993 are shown in Table 3-7.

The analysis results of the concentration of CO, NOx and TSP measured along
the motorway of the national road project III in Hubei province are shown in Table 3-
14, 3-15, and 3-16 respectively. From Table 3-14, 3-15 and 3-16 it can be seen that
the measured concentration of CO along the road is 0.17 - 2.35 mg/Nm3, and the
daily average is 0.27 - 1.92 mg/Nm3, which are less than the limits specified in the
class II standard of GB3095-82 for the anytime measured CO concentration and the
daily average.

The anytime measured concentrations of NOx from 19 monitoring spots along the
proposed road are in the range of 0.002 - 0.096 mg/Nm3; and those of the daily
average in the range of 0.005 - 0.065 mg/Nm3, all of which are below the standard
limits.
The anytime measured concentrations of TSP from each monitoring spot along
the proposed road are in the'range of 0.076 - 0.444 mg/Nm3; which are less than the
limit specified in the class II standard of GB3095-82 for the anytime measured TSP
concentration and the daily average in the range of 0.094 - 0.425 mg/Nm3, which are
below the standard limit except for the No. I spot (inside Liuwan Primary School) and
the No.2 spot (outside Liuwan Primary School) with some overage.
As mentioned above, the concentrations of CO and NOx measured at the
monitoring spots along the proposed motorway of the national road project III in
Hubei province are below the assessment standard limits; and the daily average TSP
concentration is below the stattdard limit, except for few monitoring spots with a little
overage, due to the unpaved exercising ground in the Liuwan Primary School.
Therefore air environment along the proposed road is good.
5.4 The background of the air environment quality
The five-day average is taken as the background for the daily average
concentration forecast.

6.4 Current status assessment of surface water quality
Based on the function of the water sources in the assessment area, correspondent
water quality standard is used for the assessment of each of the measured items. The
standards and the parameters are listed in Table 3-20.
Table 3-20 Water quality assessment standards and the parameters
Item    GB3838-88, Type 11 of the    GB5749-95, Drinking Watcr  GBI 1607-89, Fishery Water
Surface Water Quality Standard  Hygienic Standard         Quality Standard
PH            6.5 - 8.5                 6.5 - 8.5             Fresh water 6.5 - 8.5
Pb S             0.05                      0.05                      0.05
Oil S            0.05                                                0.05
BOD5S              3                                                    5
Single index method is used for the surface water quality assessment. The
formula is as follows.
P=C/S
where: P - pollution assessment index;
C - actual measured value (mg/kg);
S - adopted standard limit (mg/kg);
23



The formula to calculate the assessment index for PH is as follows.
PHj - 7.0
SPHJ=                   (when PHI > 7.0)
PHSU - 7.0
where: PH, - PH value at spot j;
PH,, - the upper limit of PH value in water quality standard.
The calculated standard index for PH by using the formulas are shown in Table 3-
21.
Table 3-21 The calculated standard index for PH
Index   Huanshui Wild Pig lake Wangmuhu Tongshunhe  Hanjiang   Xiaozhahu Liangzihouhu
river               lake      lake      river     lake      lake
SPHM    0.45      0.50      0.23      0.27      0.55      0.27       0.45
It can be seen from Table 3-21 that all the standard indexes for PH calculated on
the basis of on-the-spot sampling are less than 1.0, which shows that the current status
of the water quality in these places up to the standard.
Comparisons between Table 3-19 and Table 3-20 show that the indexes for Pb
and BOD are all below the correspondent standard upper limit. In terms of the index
for oil materials, except those from the Wild Pig lake and the Wangmuhu lake, which
are a little over the standard upper limit, those from all the other places are below the
correpondent standard upper limit. The reason for the overage of oil in the Wild Pig
lake and the Wangmuhu lake is due to the oil leakage and waste oil from the
motorships. In addition, the sampling time is in the end of October, i.e. the dry season
with lower water level, and there is no connections with any river for the lake. What is
more, contingency might occur for anytime sampling. Generally, the surface water
quality along the proposed road is fine.
7. Administrative Division and Population Distribution
Along the proposed road area, there are Dawu county, Xiaochang county and
Xiaonan district, originally under the jurisdiction of Xiaogan prefecture, and the East-
West lake district, Caidian district and Jiangxia district under the jurisdiction of
Wuhan municipality. According to statistics, total area of Xiaogan prefecture and
Wuhan municipality were 20024.11 km2 in 1992, accounting for 10.7%  of the
provincial total, with population of 12.3869 million, accounting for 22.5% of the
provincial total, and the population density of 619 person/km2.
8. Socio-economic Index
The main social economic indexes of the Hubei province and the areas directly

9. Current Status of Living Standard
9.1 Analysis of current living standard
The main statistical socio-economic indexes concerned with the living standard of
the affected area by the proposed road project are shown in Table 3-23.
Since 1987, along with the development of opening and reform policy, the
national economy of Hubei province has been increasing continuously and steadily,
and the people's living standard has been improving greatly, with paralleled
increasing of income level and consumption level. The per capita income for the
urban resident of Hubei province reached CNY 2453 in 1993, the average salary per
employee CNY 2933, per capita consumption CNY 2098 and per capita living area
10.5 m2. There are, however, still 1.6 %o of the families lack of house to live in and
2.6 %o of the families living in privately leased houses. The balance of the bank
deposit in 1993 is 68 times as much as that in 1987.
In Dawu county along the proposed road area is the poor mountain area of the
Hubei province, with per capita income for the farmer only CNY 625.27 in 1993.
Although the basic living conditions for food and accommodation have been solved,
further improvement of living standard is needed. Of the areas directly affected by the
proposed road project, Caidian district is relatively better in terms of per capita cash
income for peasant family, which was CNY 1106 in 1993, CNY 376 more than the
provincial average, with commercial monetary income accounting for 73.05% of the
annual total, 8.76% more than the provincial average. The living standard, however,
in most of the areas is still below the provincial average and the national average, and
shall have to be improved further. The proposed road project shall be an impetus to
enhance the living standard of the local people as well as the local economy.

9.2 Tourism resources and cultural and historical relics
Hubei province is very rich in its tourist resources. Along the proposed road
project area there are many green hills, beautiful water areas and famous historical
sites, particularly in those places in conjunction with the mountains and lakes in the
Wuhan municipal areas. The tourism resources in Xiaogan area is unique in its natural
beauty and there are 24 minority nationalities with variety of local conditions and
customs. The Double-peak mountain is located in the north-east of Xiaogan 45 km
away from the city and in the north of Jiuzongshan mountain. The name of "Double-
peak" comes from the natural scenic spot of the two peaks standing face to face, with
waterfalls hanging in the air; where a bird's-eye view of the Jianghan plain is
magnificent, when it is clear. The tomb of Dongyong, a character in a famous fairy  'V
tale in China, is beside the Dongjia lake, 6 km away from the south-east of the urban
area, with 2 stone tables in front of the tomb. There are Dongyong Park, Jiuzong
Mountain, Yellow Grass Mountain, Cemetery of Revolutionary Martyrs, historical
site of the Soviet Government buildings and many ancient cultural relics.
In brief, the areas directly affected by the proposed road project, are rich in tourist
resources with prosperous development prospects. According to the initial
investigation, no important cultural relics have been found along the road area
assessed.
9.3 Current status of local diseases
Investigation shows that , there is no class I infectious disease reported in Hubei
province. There are 17 kinds of class II infectious diseases, with total incidence of a
disease being 260.41/100000 person in 1993, of which the incidence of 9 kinds of
infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, dysentery, scarlet fever, anthrax, poliomyelitis
have dropped down considerably. Hubei province is the area with high occurrence of
snail fever, which has also been found in the East-West lake area and Caidian area.
For many years great efforts have been put to wipe out the snail, fighting against the
disease, therefore the incidence of snail fever has been greatly come down. The
incidence of local hyperthyroidism has been decreased substantially by effective
dissemination of the knowledge of the local disease and by using iodine salt.
To guarantee healthy growth of children, preventive inoculation has been
conducted in the area, with accomplished preventive inoculation rate of 98.52%, the
CG vaccine inoculation rate of 96.1%, measles vaccine inoculation rate of 91.64%,
poliomyelitis vaccine inoculation rate of 92.35%. The survey shows that the ratio of
underweight children has reduced down to 2.7%; that of the people with rickets
reduced to 3.1%, that of the avitaminosis reduced to 0.05%, that of the anaemia lack
of iron reduced to 30.8%, which basically reach the target set in the village
development program.

CHAPTER 4 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FORECAST AND
PROTECTION MEASURES
1. Analysis of Impact on Agricultural Production Caused by the Proposed Road
Total land occupation by the proposed road is about 18009 mu. In some areas the  I    C
land occupation may make the current condition of more hands than needed on farm
lands more serious. For some areas the reduction of the economic forest land will   t s -
reduce the income of the local farmers in short term. The impact for different areas
seems different, such as in the area of Caidian, Jiangxia, East-West area there are
more paddy fields loss; most of the dry land occupied by the road are in Dawu county;
but the total dry land area taken is less than that of the paddy field; and the impact
caused by lost of dry land is much less due to its low output value. However road is a
kind of linear type building, with land occupation only accounting for a very small
part of the whole directly affected area. The great impact to some of the local area can
be compensated by proper land acquisition and resettlement program and by taking
the advantage of the new development opportunity brought over by the road project.
In the hilly area, borrowing earth from hillslope during the road construction
might be good for reformation of useful farm land, so as to enhance land use
efficiency. After completion of the road, improvement of the transport condition can
be a good advantage to develop the unused land. Road infrastructure development is a
great impetus to the economic development of the whole area, by providing more
opportunities for employment, easier access to market for local industrial and
agricultural products, and more value the land. On the whole the land occupation of
tea plantation, fruit gardens, fish ponds, and etc. is small in scattered places, with little
social economic impact.
In addition to the permanent land occupation, there are some lands have to be
occupied temporarily during the road construction period, which is going to have
impact on the local farm production. The temporary use of land including the bypass
or detour road, work sheds, road construction plant sites, etc., can be rehabilitated and
used again. Compensation
is available for temporary land occupation, therefore the impact for temporary use of
land is also limited.
In the operation period of the road negative impact arising from the road can be
summarized as follows.
(1) Flying dust caused by road traffic has negative impact on vegetation in terms
of photosynthesis and respiration.
(2) Motor vehicle emissions are detrimental to the growth of agricultural crops.
(3) Lead pollutant from motor vehicle emission is poisonous to the crops.
Of the above mentioned impacts, the flying dust has the least impact, since the
29



proposed road area is situated in the south with abundant rains and less wind. The
main pollutant in vehicle emission is NOx, the concentration of which is not
exceeding the threshold to be detrimental to the crops under normal condition. Lead
emission from the traffic seems one of the major concern for the agricultural crops
during the road operation period.
2. Impact analysis of Pavement Runoff on Subgrade and Farmland
The road pavement runoff is dependent on such factors as precipitation,
precipitation intensity and time. Due to geographical position of the proposed road, it
is warm and rainy in the road area with annual precipitation over 1100 - 1450 mm,
the impact of pavement runoff on the subgrade and the farmland have to be considered
in the road design. Drainage systems for the pavement, dividing area, and the
subgrade etc., are going to be constructed. To prevent the side slope from being
eroded by catch water, catchment well, catch water drain, culvert and ditch drainage
are to be built, so that the rainfall runoff on the pavement and the adjacent areas can
be discharged away from the drainage systems, without damage to the subgrade. The
side ditch and catchment channel provide protection for the farmland from being
eroded by the pavement runoff. Therefore, the impact of pavement runoff on the
subgrade and the farmland is very small.
3. Impact Analysis of Soil Erosion
-Soil erosion is a king of geological disaster of great loss of land surface soil and
weathered rock fragments caused by running water. Soil erosion may damage the
water and land resources eventually, by blocking river, causing flood and draught
disasters, deteriorating geological and ecological environment. The factors attributable
to soil erosion include complicated natural environment and geological conditions, as
well as long time abuse of land resources in the history. At present the acceleration of
the soil erosion mainly caused by such human activities as unplanned reclamation,
open up wasteland at steep hillslope, denudation of forest and grassland, engineering
work ignoring the geological law.
Within the assessment area, the precipitation and wind are two main factors to
cause soil erosion. It is because that precipitation is the resource of surface runoff and
the permeating water in the soil, the motive forces causing soil erosion; and the wind
is the motive force causing the soil wind erosion and sand migration. In addition the
vegetation coverage and the growth condition of the soil can also be important
affecting soil erosion. According the analysis of the precipitation condition and other
factors within the proposed road areas, the time for soil erosion most likely to happen
is in July, August and September, followed by May, June and October. Therefore, the l
impact on the ecological environment along the road area during construction period
can not be ignored, especially it is necessary to reduce the soil erosion during road
construction period.
30



During the construction period and the beginning of operation period of the
proposed road, since the road construction will last 4.5 years and go through several
rainy seasons. The surface vegetation might be destroyed and the original terrain
changed due to earth borrowing, slope cutting, and treatment of speciallgeological
conditions for some road sections. It is estimated that some 21,464,yOOI?earth and
stone works will be needed, which indicates that in short term, soil erosiaan not be
avoided and the total increased area of the soil erosion will be up to about 10.3 kr2-"
along the proposed road area. The most serious soil erosion happens along the-
Jiuliguan-Xiaochang road section area with total increased erosion area of 2.5 km2?the
soil erosion module about 5500 ton/(km2fk year), and the annual growth of soil
erosion volume about 14000 ton. The soil erosion along the road section area from
Xiaochang Xiaohe to the final destination, is less serious, with total increased erosion
area of 7.8 kmrthe soil erosion module about 1000 ton/(kmlu     year), and the annual
growth of soil erosion volume about 7800 ton. However, some measures are going to
be adopted in engineering construction, such as motar paving or dry pitching for
abrupt slope, cut-off drain on the top of the slope of the road section with cutting. At
the end of the construction period and the operation period, the slope, the borrowing
and cutting area shall be recovered by vegetation. So, despite the increase of erosion
L:. ll    area in the short term, it is limited eventually. The measures to reduce the soil erosion
during the construction period can be as follows.
6 411) ((     (1) The construction of road section with large scale cut-fill work should be
arranged to avoid the rainy season, especially to avoid the heavy stormn season.  i  &  e
(2) The construction method of stepwise platformn earth borrowing should be
adopted and the discretional earth borrowing should be forbidden along the slope.
(3) During the cutting and filling work, it is better to keep the vegetation
untouched as much as possible, and any destroyed vegetation should be recovered as
soon as possible.
(4) Proper earth and stone work should be arranged, giving priority to highland
and waste land to be selected as borrow pit. To plant vegetation timely or take other
measures to recover the borrow pit and the waste land.
(5) At road section with deep cut, necessary platform should be built by the side
ditch and the catch ditch be built at the top of the slope. For large area soil side slope,
slab stones, retaining wall or turf should be used for protection.
&   (i) ;  (6) During road construction period, it is better to built retaining wall first then to
\     start subgrade filling, or cut-and-fill, cut-and -transport, spread-and-compaction
should be adopted as much as possible so as to reduce soil erosion during construction
period.
Meanwhile during the design stage, design of comprehensive drainage system
should be conducted, with side ditch, catch channel, drainage trench for the subgrade,
and drop water or swift running water trench built when necessary, so that to channel
the surface run-off into the natural drainage ditch or directly into the inlet or outlet of
Thi                         . 9       lQc      



the culvert. In the design stage greening design should also be included, to reduce the
soil erosion as far as possible.
4. Impact Analysis on Farmland Vegetation by Road Construction
Land occupation is necessary for road construction, including the land for
subgrade, borrowing pit, waste area and other temporary land occupation. Therefore
road construction affects the farmland vegetation to some extent. The land occupation
for subgrade use is permanent and the farmland thus occupied will be lost, usually
loss of land for grain crops. But after completion of the proposed road, more cash
crops will be planted instead of grain crops, due to the improvement of transport
condition. The changed land use pattern. will bring more income for the farmers. In
addition, there are some waste land in the area need to be developed with great
potentials. So the impact caused by occupation of land by subgrade can be reduced to
the minimum. As for the temporary land occupation for earth borrowing, the surface
soil of the cultivated land should be put aside to be preserved, and at the end of the
temporary land use, the surface soil will be put back for farm use. In this way the
surface soil may be preserved, but some impact still may have in terms of soil
nutrition loss. The content of organic matters in the soil is related to the soil depth. In
general, the depth of cultivated soil is about 15 - 17 cm, where the soil nutrient and
50 - 60% of the roots of wheat, maize and cotton etc. are distributed. Therefore, it is
better to borrow earth from the depth 20 cm down below the surface for the subgrade
construction. It usually takes at least 3 - 4 years for the organic fertilizer of the soil to
be recovered to original level by intensive and meticulous farming. So the farmland
vegetation will be affected in the road construction period, but the impact can be
reduced to the minimum through proper treatment and preservation of the surface
cultivated soil for temporarily occupied land.
5. Forecast of Lead Emission Impact on Farmland Soil and Crops
5.1 Analysis of lead emission impact on farmland soil
The migration and accumulation of heavy metal in the soil can be described by the
following equation.
W=K(B + R)
where  W - accumulated lead in the soil;
K - residual rate of lead in the soil;

5.2 Calculation of the soil environmental capacity
The pollutant content in the soil may have a threshold concentration or critical
level, below which no accumulation or no harm  shall be produced for plants. Only
when the pollutant content in the land exceeds the threshold the crops from the land
may not meet the standard for food production, or the output of the crops may be
decreased. Therefore it is allowed for the soil to have some pollutant. The maximum
pollutant content allowed in the soil without harm to the crops is called soil
environment capacity, which can be calculated with the following formula.
Q   (Ck  -  Wn) X  150
where:  Q - soil environmental capacity;
Ck - critical content of lead in the soil (mg/kg);
Wn  accumulated lead in the soil (mg/kg).
The results of calculated soil environmental capacity of lead for each road section
are listed in Table 4-2.

5.3 Forecast of soil pollution index
Single index method is used to forecast the soil pollution index, with the formula
as follows.
33



p=c/S
where: P - pollution assessment index;
C - forecasted total lead amount;
S - selected assessment standard (mg/kg).
Based on the forecast of accumulated lead in the soil, shown in Table 4-1, the
forecast of lead pollution index can be calculated, as listed in Table 4-3.
It can be seen from Table 4-3 that the lead pollution index for the soil of depth
0 - 20 cm along the proposed road area covered by EIA is less than 1.0 in all the
forecast years of 2000, 2010 and 2020. So the lead pollution caused by the vehicle
emissions from the traffic during the road construction and after the road in operation
will be of no harn to the soil along the road area covered by the EIA. Although the
lead content in the soil along the road in a distance of 30 - 50 m from the road center
may be higher than that in a distance over 50 m, the pollution index is not easy to
reach 2.5. Even when the index reaches 2.5, it is still regarded as in a state of light
pollution.
The analysis of soil environmental capacity for lead pollution, based on Table 4-2,
shows that in-the years of 2000, 2010 and 2020 after the road in operation, the soil
environmental capacity of lead for all the road section is over 40 kg per mu, i.e. 40
kg/mu can still be accepted before the critical threshold of lead content 300 mg/k& is
reached, which indicates that by the year of 2020, the soil pollution caiig    elead
emission from the traffic is far from serious.
6. Impact Analysis on Water Environment
6.1 Surface water pollution caused by road construction
During the road construction period, the impact on the surface water quality is
mainly caused by the engineering work, including bridge substructure construction,
discharge of waste water from worksite and living area. The boring pile construction
process shall be adopted for the deep water pier construction, which separates the
water area from the working face and can significantly reduce the negative impact
caused by the substrate silt resuspension . The cement concrete materials used for
the bridge pier are mixed at mixing plant a distance away from the river, therefore
there is no waste water discharged into the river. Little amount of sand and soil may
drop into the river, but no quality deterioration can be observed. In the labour camp t   )
area, since the number of the workers is| limitedl only small amount of sewage water
(with COD and BOD5 will be produced, with little impact on the water quality of the
river. To protect the water resource from being polluted during road and bridge
construction period, it is re commended that dustbin and sanitary facilities be used
including sewage tank, at the worksite and the living area, and regular cleaning and
treatment of the wastes be carried out to prevent diseases from spreading. It should
also be forbidden to drop any wastes and construction materials into the river.
6.2 Impact on farmland irrigation system and waterlogged lowland
The proposed road area is in the area of Yangtze river system. The rivers for the
34



road to have to cross over include Hangjiang river and its branches Tongshun river,
Fuhe river, and Lunhe river. Total length of major road is 200.408 km, one 1370 m
long extra-large bridge, 10 medium and large bridges with span greater than 20 m
with total length of 4664 m, 73 small and middle bridges with span less than 20 m and
total length of 2418.9 m. For the extra-large bridge, the design is based on the
assumption of flood occurrence of once every 300 hundred years, and for the large,
medium and small bridges, it is once every 100 years, which implies that there will be
no impact on the river's flood discharge. The design of the road facilities has been
made based on the area investigation of water irrigation and farmland system. A total
of 698 culverts are going to be built, with average of 3.5 culverts every one kilometer
for proper farmland irrigation on both sides of the road, basically evenly distributed.
On the whole, there will be no great change for the farmland irrigation system along
the road area only with ane     a        some parts. TBe proposed road areain ,
Dawu is hilly, with road aligrnent along the foot of hillslope, and the subgrade can be
obstruction of flood from the hill, to protect the farmland from being damaged by ||
mountain torrents. Therefore, the road construction will positively promote the local
agricultural-production.
6.3 Impact on surface water quality in operation period
The road construction project is a kind of development project. Different road
structures of bridges and culverts are going to be built to accommodate the natural
conditions. Once the road is put into operation, the road traffic will be the major
source of pollutants, which mainly include vehicle emissions of lead and its
compound, the oil materials, etc.. The pollutant concentration in the rainfall catched
on the pavement is shown in Table 4--3-1; and the allowable pollutant concentration
discharged is shown in Table 4-3-2. Comparisons between the two tables, Table 4-3-1
and Table 4-3-2, show that for the run-off water, the PH is 7.4, and the pollutants in
the run-off water such as CODCr, BOD5, oil, lead, are all within the maximum
allowable emission concentration of class two standard, only with SS pollutant being
higher above the standard limit.
Table 4-3-1 Pollutant concentration in pavement run-off (Unit: mg/kg)
Item           PH      COD,,   BOD         Oil     PB       SS

Table 4-3-2 Water pollutant maximum allowable emission concentration (Unit: mg/kg)

Class 1i standard  6 - 9     150      60  J   10   |  1.0       200
Based on the assessment of the current status of water quality, great differences
still exist between the content of lead compound and the correspondent standard.
According to the forecast of lead content in soil, by the end of 2020, when the traffic
reaches the forecasted level, the accumulated lead loaded into the soil will be 7.11
mg/kg. The Wangmu lake, Wild Pig lake, Huanshui river, Xiaozhahu lake and
35



Liangzihouhu lake, etc., are more than 100 m away from the proposed road, so there
are almost no impact on these water sources., except for large rivers, such as Hanjiang
river and Tongshun river. As for the flowing river, the lead content will not exceed the
standard level because some of the lead will be absorbed by the silt and some diluted
by the water. For oil materials, when the vehicle passes by, the tire will take some oil
away. It is possible for some lead to reach the slope ditch and come into water body
during heavy rainy season. However, there is only few oil materials dropped on the
pavement and the survey shows that the current status of water quality is fairy good.  3
Moreover the pollutants may be adsorbed by the mud and sand, while they are carried
over by run-off a long way through the side ditches before getting into the water body,
where the running water usually may go through self cleaning process. To prevent the I!   t 
road side water body, such as fish ponds etc., from being polluted by the run-off,  r
comprehensive drainage design is 2rommen    which makes the run-off being H
discharged into the natural ditches, neither to any farm use water body nor to any 1
farmland.
The sewage and waste water from the road service area, vehicle washing, fueling
and maintenance station should not be discharged directly into water source and  -
farmland. Two stage sewage and waste water treatment system is recommended for  (&_f^<
the four service areas of the proposed road, with cycled water cleaning system for
vehicle washing and oil/water separation device for oil containing waste water  -
treatment so as to meet the class I emission standard specified in the state standard of
GB8979-88.
7. Forecast and Assessment of Acoustic Impact
7.1 Forecast and assessment of noise environment during the construction period
The impact of noise on the work site workers and the vicinity areas is likely to
happen during the road construction period, because of the large scale and long lasting
time of the motorway construction as well as the high level noise construction
machines. It will take 3.5 years for construction of the road project, with total length
of the Liuliguan-Junshan and Jinkou-Shenshan motorway of Beijing-Zhuhai national
trunk road being 173 km, plus 57.4 km of the Wuhan East-West Section of Shanghai-
Chengdu national trunk road. So it is of practical significance to do noise impact
assessment and to take some protection measures.
The source of noise during road construction period mainly comes from the
construction machines and the worksite traffic. The road construction machines used
in China mainly include excavator, bulldozer, road grader, road roller, mixer and etc..
The "Specification for Highway Traffic Environment Impact Assessment (Draft)"
gives the measured noise level of some of the road construction machines, seen in
Table 4-4.

The noise level of the stabilizer measured at the spot of 30 meters away from the
center of the machine is 84 dB(A), and will reach 90 dB(A) when measured 10 meters
from the machine, When driving on the field the noise level is 75.5 dB(A) at the place
30 meters from the machine and will reach 88.5 dB(A) when the distance reduced to
7.5 meters.
Noise endangers the environment seriously, with potential threat to human health.
Long period exposure to the noise environment may cause diseases, particularly deaf
incurred by noise is incurable. Statistics shows that the deaf rate is increased with the
increase of noise level.
Noise incurred deaf is not only dependent on the noise level but also on the
duration exposed to the noise. The longer the duration the more serious would be the
hurt.
Taking the average hearing threshold of the frequencies of 500, 1000 and 2000
Hz as the limit of deaf, which is 25 dB, the analysis of 2824 persons' hearing ability is
made and shows that the noise environment with 90 dB(A) will endanger the workers'
hearing to some extent, but 6.4% of the persons with less than 30 years standing show
obvious language and hearing barrier. The environment with noise level above 90
dB(A) will seriously affect workers' hearing ability.
During the road construction period, the noise level produced by the road
construction machines can usually reach over 80 dB(A), or even over 90 dB(A). These
noises are greatly detrimental to the workers, especially the machine operators. With  iM.  
the increase of the workers' service length, various damage effects will emerge,
37



particularly the incurable hearing damage. In addition, the noise during the road
construction, will have great impact on the vicinity areas, such as resident areas,
schools and hospitals which are sensitive to the noise. In order to protect the
environment, the State Public Health Ministry and the State Labour Bureau have
issued the "Hygiene Standard of Industrial and Enterprise Noise", and Table 4-5
shows the summary. Therefore it is recommended that proper working shift should be
arranged by taking turns in operating the road construction machines to reduce the
time for the workers to be exposed to the high noise environment, so as to have time
to recover hearing ability. Meanwhile proper maintenance and operation of the
machines are also important in order to keep the machine in low noise level. some
measures of labour -protection, such as to wear noise-proof earplug, head helmet,
should be adopted for the workers with longer time close to the noise source, or in
accordance with the state labour and hygiene standard, to reduce working time
properly.

|ote: The maximum noise level Sbe above 105 dB(A)
Due to the serious noise impact during the road construction period, the following
environmental and labour protection measures are recommended.
(1) The rest room for the workers should be in a distance to the worksite,
normally 200 meters away from the worksite. For the resident areas, hospitals and
schools nearby, such protection measures as relocation, installation of sound
insulation doors and windows should be adopted.
(2) For the workers with longer working time, the noise-proof earplug and cotton,
ear-cover, and head helmet should be put on. Or according to the noise level, the
working time may be reduced properly.
(3) Since the noise at night usually disturbs people from going to sleep, night
work (22:00 - 6:00) should not be arranged as far as possible for such road sections
with villages, towns and resident areas nearby (within a distance of 100 meters).
(4) For construction machines, it is possible to reduce the noise level by proper
selection of low noise machines, careful maintenance and operation.
7.2 Forecast of traffic noise during road operation period
The equivalent traffic noise level Leq during the operation period depends on the
traffic volume, vehicle composition, vehicle speed, vehicle acoustic frequency level as
well as longitudinal grade of the road, pavement roughness, and etc..
38



7.2.1 Traffic volume
According to the road project feasibility study report, the traffic forecast have
been made for the 10 road sections, shown in Table 2-1. The night time traffic
accounts for 36% of the total, with the daytime and nighttime traffic 4-6 ratio being
1.74:1.
7.2.2 Traffic composition
The vehicle sunning on the road can be classified into small-type vehicles,
medium type vehicles and large type vehicle vehicles in terms of noise level. Table 4-
6 shows the details.
Table 4-6 Classification of vehicles
No. Vehicle type                       Definition
Small  Truck: less than 2.5 ton; Passenger car: less than 26 seats (including motorcycle, tricycle)
2   Medium  Truck: 2.5 - 7ton; Passenger car: 26 - 55 seats.
3    Large  Truck: more than 7 tons; Passenger car: more than 55 seats; Trailer
4   |    Other    |Tractors, etc.
Based on the above mentioned classification, the forecasted vehicle composition 1   5
in the future for the small/medium/large vehicle ratio in the year of 2000, 2010 and | |
2020 are: 34/54/12, 41/45/14 and 51/33/16 respectively.
7.2.3 Road classification
The proposed road is motorway, with the road section from Jiuliguan to
Xiaochang Xiaohe being 49.821 km, mainly passing through hilly area, where the
motorway standard of 4 lanes in heavy hilly area is adopted with subgrade width of-
24.5 m; bridge deck net width of 2 x 10.75 m; designed vehicle speed of 100 km/h,
the maximum longitudinal grade of 4%; the minimum radius of horizontal curve of - -  2

designed vehicle speed of 120 km/himum  longitudinal grade of 3%; minimum
radius of horizontal curve of 1000 m. Thle road section from Zhushan to Shenshan is
10.433 km, mainly in plain a area, which is the joint section of Beijing-Zhuhai
and Shanghai-Chengdu national trunk road. The motorway standard of 6 lanes in plain
hilly area is adopted, with subgrade width of 33.5 m; bridge deck net width of 2 x
14.75 m; design vehicle speed of 120 km/h; the maximum vehicle longitudinal grade
of 3%; the minimum radius of horizontal curve ofllO00     The road section from
Shenshan to Baoxie is 44.526 km, with main technical indexes similar to those for the
road section from Zhushan to Yongan.
39



7.2.4 Vehicle speed
The design speed for vehicles on the motorway in heavy hilly area is 100 km/h; in
plain slight hilly area and the joint section is 120 km/h, but according to analysis of
vehicle condition in China and the survey on current motorway in China, the vehicle   i¢4rfct
speed can not reach the design speed, the average speed of small freight vehicle 70
km/h, small passenger car 80 km/h, the medium and large freight vehicle 50 km/h.
The future vehicle condition might be better but the increase of the traffic volume will
limit the vehicle speed. Therefore the following vehicle speed is assumed: small l 7
vehicle 80 km/h; small truck 70 km/h; medium and large truck 50 km/h, which are the
vehicle speed used in the assessment calculation.
7.2.5 Assessment year
The assessment year for the proposed road is based on the following: the year of
2000 representing operation base year, the year of 2010 representing medium term
operation, the year of 2020 representing long term operation, for which the noise
impact assessment is made respectively.
7.2.6 The formula for traffic noise prediction
According to the requirements of the terms of references for environment impact
assessment, by using the environmental assessment specifications proposed by the
MOC, the traffic noise during the 3 periods will be forecasted. The formula used for
the forecast is as follows.
N1
(LA.q)i =LWi+ IO1 g(  ) - ALDs+ALLG+ ALpv - 13(dB)
V1T
where: (LAeq)i  - per hour traffic noise level, recorded by i-type vehicle through the
measuring spot for the daytime and nighttime forecast;
L,. i   - average radiation noise level of i-type vehicle, dB;
i      - large, medium, small vehicle;
N1     - daytime or nighttime average hourly traffic of i-type vehicle,
Veh./h.;
V1     - average speed of i-type vehicle, km/h;
T      - forecast time of (LAq), here it is I h, h;
ALDS   - noise damping of i-type vehicle at forecast spot in a distance of r
from the noise equivalent driving line, dB;
ALLG   - traffic noise correction caused by road longitudinal grade, dB;
ALPv   - traffic noise correction caused by the pavement, dB;
The traffic noise level (LA¢q)tCff, received by different types of vehicle at the
forecast spot in the daytime or nighttime can be calculated as follows:

7.2.7 Determination of the parameters in the forecast formula
7.2.7.1 Average radiation noise level
Average radiation noise level of different types of vehicle L can be calculated as
follows:
Large vehicle:  Lw i = 77.2 + 0.1 8VL        1
Medium vehicle: LW M = 62.6 + 0.32VM         >  (dB)
Small vehicle:      LW,S = 59.3 + 0.23Vs     J
7.2.7.2 Calculation of noise damping with distance ALDS
The distance between vehicles of i-type in the daytime and nighttime can be
calculated as follows:
Vj
di= 1000
N,
The distance from measuring spot for forecast to the equivalent noise level
driving route r2 can be calculated as follows:
r2=ADN   DF
where: DN  -   distance between measuring spot for forecast and nearside lane;
DF  -   distance between measuring spot for forecast and farside lane;
ALDS can be calculated as the following.
r2
when r2 < di / 2, AL0s, i = K, * K2 * 20
7.5
0.5di
when r2 > di / 2, ALDS, i = 20K1(K2lg + lg r12 / 0.5di)

The surface condition related constant K, and the distance related constant K2 are
determined as shown in Table 4-7 and Table 4-8.
Table 4-7 Surface condition related constant K,
Hard surface                              K = 0.9
General clay surface                         K = 1.0

7.2.7.3 Traffic noise correction (ALLD) caused by longitudinal grade of road
The traffic noise corrections taken for the large, medium, and small type vehicles
in heavy hilly area are 3.92 dB, 2.92 dB, and 2 dB respectively; in plain slight hilly
area the corrections are 2.94 dB, 2.19 dB and 1.5 dB respectively.
7.2.7.4 Traffic noise correction (ALpv) caused by road pavement
41



The traffic noise correction (ALpv) caused by road pavement is listed in Table 4-9.
Table 4-9 Traffic noise correction (ALpv) caused by road pavement
Pavement                            AL v (dB)
Bitumen concrete pavement                      0
Cement concrete pavement                     I - 2
Note: Since the proportion of small type vehicle is less than 60%, the lower limit level is taken.
7.2.7.5 Traffic noise correction (AL,) caused by curve or length of the road
The traffic noise correction (AL,) caused by curve or length of the road can be
calculated as follows.
0
AL,= -l10 Ig              (dB)
180
where: 0 - angle between the visual lines at the measuring spot to both ends of the
road
7.2.7.6 Traffic noise correction (AL2) due to the barriers between the measuring
spot and the road
Traffic noise correction (AL2) due to the barriers between the measuring spot and
the road can be calculated as follows.
AL2 = AL2FRT + AL2BUD + AL2NIA
where: AL2RT - level A equivalent noise damping due to forest barrier;
AL2BUD - level A equivalent noise damping due to building barrier;
ALMh  - level A equivalent noise damping due to the measuring spot for
forecast being located in acoustic shadow area on both sides of high
embankment or low cutting, which can get by looking up from the
traffic noise forecast table.
7.2.8 Traffic noise forecast
By using the above mentioned formulas and data, forecasts of the noise level of
different road sections in the 3 operation period can be made, as shown in Table 4-10.
It can be seen from Table 4-10 that in all the 3 operation period of short term, mid
term and long tern period, the distance from the isopleth of 70 dB(A) to the roadside
in daytime for different road sections of the proposed road is less than 60 m. In the
short term period, the distance from the isopleth of 55dB(A) to the roadside is 100 m
at nighttime for road sections of Zhushan - Yongan, Shenshan - Baoxie, Dawu -
Hanlao, Hanlao - Sancha; and for road sections of Quanli - Zhushan, Sancha -
Quanli, Zhushan - Shenshan, the distance is 120 m.

(     In the mid term period, the distance from the isopleth of 55dB(A) to the roadside
at nighttime for road sections of Zhushan - Yongan, Dawu - Hanlao, Shenshan -
Baoxie is 140 m; for road sections of Hanlao - Sancha - Quanli, the distance is 160
m; for road section of Quanli - Zhushan it is 180 m; and for the road section of
LAs 6    Zhushan - Shenshan it is 190 m.
In the long term period, the distance from the isopleth of 55dB(A) to the roadside
is less than 180 m at nighttime for road sections of Zhushan - Yongan and
Shenshan - Baoxie; for road sections of Dawu - Hanlao it is 200 m; and for road
v $; *t  sections of Hanlao - Sancha - Quanli - Zhushan - Shenshan it is less than 220 m.
The traffic forecast shows that the nighttime noise pollution is more serious with
more impact area. Since people is more sensitive to noise at night, it is very important
to take necessary measures for protection.
7.2.9 Noise impact forecast for the operation period
The forecast of the environmental noise at both sides of the road is the sum of the
forecasted traffic noise and the background noise, with calculation formula as follows.
Leqfc. = 10 lg(10° "lzffrc + 0° O"back. )
To protect the noise sensitive area, it is necessary to forecast the noise environment in
the different operation period (short term, mid term, long term), with quantitative
analysis so as to provide basis for environment protection suggestions and measures.
Based on the survey of the national road project III in Hubei province, the
sensitive spots within the assessment area are shown in Table 4-1 1.
The sum of the current noise level (i.e. background noise level) and the forecasted
traffic noise level in different operation period, makes the forecast of the environment
quality of the noise sensitive spot during road operation period, with the details of the
forecast shown in Table 4-12
7.2.10 Assessment of noise impact in operation period
The results of the forecasted noise level at each noise sensitive spot in different
operation period are listed in Table 4-13.
Table 4-13 shows that the noise condition at night during different operation
periods is very serious, all of which is over the standard level at each sensitive spot,
except for those at Xiaohe Guanshan village and the Dazhangguan village, where the
noise level is below the standard level in the short term period, and at the Baoxie area,
where the noise level is below the standard in all the operation period. In the short
term period, the nighttime noise overage is 0.2 - 0.92 dB(A) above the standard level;
in the mid term period, the nighttime overage is 2.4 - 11.5 dB(A); and in the long
term period, 4.7 - 13.1 dB(A).

In the initial operation period, the daytime noise overages at the primary schools
of Liuhuan, Xinfu and Liuwan are 3.9 dB(A), 5.7dB(A), and 0.6 dB(A) respectively,
and those at all the other noise sensitive spots is below the standard level. In the mid
term operation period, the daytime overage at the above mentioned three primary
schools is over 3.8 - 8 dB(A), with those of the other sensitive spots being below the
standard level. In the long term operation period, the daytime overage at the above
mentioned three primary schools is over 6.2 - 9.6 dB(A) and those at Jianguo village,
Quanli and Xiaojialing being 0.1 dB(A), 0.4 dB(A) and 1.2 dB(A) respectively, with
those at all the other sensitive spots being below the standard level.
As mentioned above the most serious daytime noise impact happens at the school,
and the most serious nighttime noise impact happens at the densely populated area.
Therefore it is necessary to take some measures to protect the schools and the | 8
residential areas from being disturbed by the noise environment based on the local
conditions.
8. Forecast and Assessment of Air Environment Impact
8.1 Analysis of air impact in the construction period
The pollutants produced during the road construction period mainly are dust,
particulate and bitumen smoke. The dusts and particulate mainly arise from open or
uncontrolled bitumen mixing plant, construction material spillage during transport
over the worksite, worksite traffic and the construction machine operation. The
bitumen smoke arises from the worksite heating and mixing of bitumen materials as
well as paving of the bitumen materials.
46



The mixing of lime and soil materials produces a lot of dusts. There are two kinds
of mixing technology: road-mixing and station-mixing. The station-mixing mixes the
construction materials in a stationary plant, with the mixed materials being transported
by vehicles to the worksite; and the road mixing mixes the construction materials at
the roadside mixing plant. Comparison shows that the impact area of the stationary
mixing plant is greater than that of the road mixing plant. The impact area for the
stationary mixing plant can be 150 m in the leeward direction of the plant. The impact
area for the road mixing plant is smaller but it goes along with the road. Great amount
of lime materials are needed for the lime soil mixtures. The lime content in the dusts
may damage the roadside vegetation or crops.
The dusts are small in size, with diameter over 10 - 200p.m. The dust distribution
in terms of its size over unpaved road area is as follows: dusts with diameter less than
5p.m accounting for 8%, 5pm  - 30p.m  accounting for 24%, greater than 30pm
accounting for 68%. So it is easy to cause the dusts flying over the construction area.
The flying dusts are less hazardous and in shorter duration comparing to lime dust.
Table 4-14 shows some of the TSP survey results.

_____________________       Leeward direction 150                5.039
Based on the survey conducted by the RIOH, the bitumen smoke measured at
place in the leeward direction 150 m from the Italian made bitumen mixer MVZA is
below  150 mg/Nm3, which is the class I of the standard limit specified in the
"Bitumen Industry Pollutant Emission Standard" GB4916-85; the measured other
pollutants emitted from the MVZA include benzo-pyrene, which meets the reference
standard for Beijing area and the TSP, which meets the class II state standard. This is
a relatively advanced bitumen mixer, a totally closed mixing plant, with much less
impact.
If totally closed advanced bitumen mixing plant is used, the environment quality
may meet the standard requirement even at placeF3_ away in the leeward direction
of the plant. Therefore, it is recommended that proper selection of bitumen mixing
plant be made; and that the mixing plant be set at places 200 m away from the air

quality sensitive areas, such as schools, hospitals and densely populated areas.
8.2 Air quality impact forecast and assessment for the road operation period
8.2.1 Calculation of linear pollution source
The statistical survey shows that the driving mode for most of the vehicles on
high grade road, especially on motorway, can be regarded as constant speed cruise
mode. To make the calculation easier, the vehicles in the road traffic are classified into
three types: large, medium and small. The emission factors for all these types of the
in-use vehicles under the constant speed cruise mode have been worked out by the
RIOH.
According to the traffic forecast in the feasibility study report for this road
engineering project, the forecasted traffic volume proportions shared by the three
vehicle types can be summarized as shown in Table 4-15.
Table 4-15 Forecasted traffic volume proportions shared by the 3 vehicle types (%)

2020                51                 33                 16
The road traffic forecast for the new road is shown in Table 2-1.
Peak hour traffic volume
The peak hour traffic volume accounts for 6.4% of the daily traffic volume, i.e.
ratio of the peak hours traffic volume to the daily traffic volume is 1.536.
Daytime/nighttime traffic ratio
The ratio of 12 hours daytime traffic volume to 24 hours daily traffic volume is
1.74, i.e. the ratio of the daytime volume to the nighttime volume is 0.87/0.13.
Based on the above data, the traffic volume forecast for each road section can be
calculated, as shown in Table 4-16.
The emission intensity of each pollutant by road sections can be calculated. Table
4-17 shows the emission intensities of CO and NOx by road section.

8.2.2 Air pollutant concentration forecast model
According to the approved "Terms of Reference for EIA", the freeway traffic
emission dispersion model developed by the Federal Highway Administration of the
USA is adopted in air pollutant concentration forecast, which is as the following.
2               QL                        - He2
C(XM   )=(    )i/                                exp
7t      U  * SinO [azo + cz (X)]          2 [Go + az (X)]2
where:  C   -   pollutant concentration at spot x from the linear source (mg/m3);
X   -   vertical distance from  the linear source to the leeward measuring
spot;
0   -   angle between wind direction and road (0);
QL  -   linear intensity of the road (mg/m i         s);
U   -   wind speed over road (m/s);
He -   average effective height of the linear source (m);
sz  -   vertical dispersion parameter (m);
ozo -   initial vertical dispersion parameter (assuming 3 m).
The determination and modification of the parameters of the forecast model are
usually made as follows.
The wind  speed, wind  direction  and  the air stability  refer to those  in the
"Statistics and Analysis of the Pollution and Meteorological Information along the
Road Area";
The angle between the average year prevailing wind direction and the road alignment
of each road section of the proposed road is 0 = 250, 450, 600 or 900.
The parameter of He is based on average embankment height of 4 m of the road.
50



It is known from the feasibility study report that the lane width is 7.5 m or 11.25 m.
The dispersion parameter: cz (X) = ozo + r2X2
According to the method recommended by the state standard GB3840-90,
calculation of the dispersion parameter is subjected to the condition of open rural area.
8.2.3 Forecast and analysis of CO and NOx concentrations
The dispersion forecast of the concentrations of the CO and NOx emissions along
the road areas in the short term (by the year of 2000), mid (by the year of 2010) and
long term (by the year of 2020) of the road operation period is summarized in Table 4-
18 - Table 4-23.
The forecasts show that there will be slight overage of NOx in a distance of 50 m
or 20 m from the roadside for road sections of Zhushan-Shenshan, Quanli-Zhushan
and Hanlao-Sancha by the year of 2020 (long term forecast), except for which the CO
and NOx emissions for all the other road sections will be up to the class II of the State
Air Environment Quality Standard.
The pollutant concentration at the major sensitive spots along the proposed road
area should be the sum of the model based forecast and the background concentration
(CB), with the details shown in Table 4-24 - Table 4-26. It can be seen from the table
that neither the daily average nor the anytime measurement of the CO concentration
shall over the class II standard limits (4 mg/Nm3, 10 mg/Nm3), specified by the State
Air Environment Quality Standard, either in the year of 2010 or in the year of 2020. In
the short term (by the year of 2000), the sum of forecasted NOx and the background
concentration is below the class II standard limits (0.1 mg/Nm3 and 0.15 mg/Nm3),
specified by the State Air Environment Quality Standard. It is known from Table 4-25
that in the mid term (by the year of 2010), the sum of forecasted NOx and the
background concentration at the Jinkou Medical Plant, Baoxie and Liuhuan Primary
School is over the class II standard limits in terms of the anytime measured
concentration in a distance of 25 - 60 m in leeward direction; and is below the
standard limit in terms of the daily average concentration. In the long term (by the
year of 2020), the sum of forecasted NOx and the background concentration at the
Liuhuan Primary School, Xinfu Primary School and the resident area near the Jinkou
medical Plant is over the standard limits in terms of the daily average and the anytime
measured concentration in a distance of 15 - 50 m and 25 - 140 m respectively in
the leeward direction.
On the whole, after the proposed road open to the traffic, either in the year of
2000 or the year of 2020, when the expected traffic volume is reached, the CO
concentration on both sides of the road will not be over the standard limit; however, in
the mid term (by the year of 2010), particularly in the long term (by the year of 2020),  fr ;
the concentration of NOx may be over the standard limit in a distance of 15 - 140 m
from the road center, but the probability is small.

9. Social Environment Impact Assessment
9.1 To promote high speed economic development along the road area
The proposed road is the major part of the trunk road in Hubei province, and a
key link connecting with the five provinces and one city, i.e. the capital Beijing,
Hebei, Hubei, Henan, Hunan and Guangdong. Therefore, the implementation of this
road project will not only promote social economic development along the road
project area but also that of the whole Hubei province.
The GNP of the Hubei province is expected to reach CNY 210 billion by the year
of 2000, the gross output value of the industry and agriculture CNY 448.4 billion. The
industrial structure and layout in Hubei province will be greatly changed with more
investment and export-oriented enterprises to be developed. The GNP of Xiaogan area
will reach CNY 15.4 billion, the gross output value of industry and agriculture CNY
25.9 billion. Wuhan city is developing into an open, modem, important industrial and
commercial base of iron and steel, motor vehicle manufacture, scientific research and
development, multi-functional international city, with three economic development
areas of Donghu (East Lake) Economic Development Zone, Wuhan Economic
Development Zone and Yangluo Economic Development Zone of high economic
strength. by the year of 2000, the GNP of the Wuhan city will reach CNY 50 billion,
gross output value of industry and agriculture CNY 99.3 billion.
The completion of the road project will be an impetus to materialize the above
mentioned target, by improving the transport system, promoting the rural and
township enterprises development, with more enterprises emerging along the newly
constructed road area, to form new industrial belt and providing more employment
opportunities.
The completion of the road project can improve the traffic conditions of the road
network, increase the transport capacity and service level of the road network system,
ease the urban traffic congestion, function as key link connecting with other transport
mode of railways, airport, inland waterways and ports, and attract more investment in
the area along road etc..
The proposed road area is rich in tourist resources, with beautiful rivers, lakes and
mountains. The completion of the road project can of great help to the development of
the local and the provincial tourism, by providing direct, fast, safe and comfortable
high quality transport service to make full use of the local natural resources.
The road project will speed up the rural and small township development along
the road area, by providing basic condition of the infrastructure facility, a convenient
and fast transport corridor, which is good for the local farm and sideline products'   I  >(,
marketing as well as production.
As mentioned above, the proposed road project will provide necessary material
61



guarantee for the rapid development of social economic system along the road area.
9.2 Harmonization of the road and the natural landscape
Road should be an integrated system of different road structures such as
embankment, side slope, viaducts, bridges, tunnels, interchanges, separate grade
crossing, vegetation, and the natural environment. The completion of Jiuliguan-
Junshan motorway together with Zhushan-Yongan road and Jinkou-Baoxie road is a
motorized corridor with broad and smooth pavement with eye-catching road markings,
traffic signs boards, modem traffic engineering facilities and the 'road sidereen belt| .
forming a magnificent picture, a new unique scenery harmonized with the nature.
To harmonize the road structue  th the local beautiful natural environment, it is
proposed that       teirchange    oll facility buildingsj    t i nd service areas,
rest area anmaintenance base areas be specially designed and built in
terms of the colour and building style. In addition, included in this proposed road
there are a total of 5 extra-large bridges, 28 large medium sized bridges, 64 small
bridges, 13 separate grade crossings (including highway-railway separate grade
crossing). It is also important to take into account not only the colours and styles but
also the local traffic and tourist information service for the road users and tourists in
the design of the road structures and facilities.
The green belt engineering should be done not only for the protection of the .
embankment and the side slopes, but also for landscape harmony and integration by
proper selection of suitable tree and grass species. It should have good visual effects
for the road users for a safe and comfortable journey. Special attention should be paid'
to treat roadside stone and earth borrowing pit areas. The afforesting along the road
area should be well planned, not only the road construction department but also the
whole society should be mobilized to take part in the work, to make the road green
belt and the local area greening an integrate system.
9.3 Land acquisition and resettlement
Early in the design stage, effort should be made to avoid the road passing through
the cities, towns, villages and farmland, so as to reduce the relocation and resettlement
as much as possible. According to the feasibility study report of the road project, a
total of land acquisition of 17003.3 mu is needed, with relocation areas of 139593 m2 .
for the main road; and a tQtal of land acquisition of 1005.7 Mu, with relocation area of
13327 m2 for the connection road. The project owner and the local government attach
great importance to the land acquisition and ritne`ment for the road project.
Specialized office has been set to deal with the land acquisition and resettlement work,
and to carry out various related policies and coordination.
The resettlement work will follow the principle of in the interests of the general
public based on unified leadership and public consultation and participation. The
owner of the land property will be compensated according to the relative documents
62



of Hubei provincial people's government. The farmland compensation will be t
collectively controlled by the village government for land development, local
farmland condition improvement, local people resettlement, without lowering the
resettled people's living standard.
The compensation for local people's houses will be given to the house owner,
according to the provincial or local government regulations and documents. The land
development and new house construction will be arranged by the local government.
There will be no negative impact on the people's living standard.
9.4 Partition impact caused by the road
The proposed road is a totally closed motorway, with all the crossed intersections
being built in the forms of interchanges or separate grade crossings. The road will
partite the local farmland and community. To mitigate the partition impact measures
have to be taken in the design of the road, so as to provide convenience for the local
people's farm work and daily live. Therefore in the design stage'340iunderpasses,
with average of one underpass every 589 meters, have been arranged for the existing
minor roads, farm rods, and pedestrian paths. The underpasses can be classified into
three types by theirs use.
(1) Underpass for the major rural roads intersected with the proposed road is
mainly for various motor vehicles and farm tractors, with width 8 m and height 3.5 m;
(2) Underpass for tractor-ploughing farm roads intersected with the proposed road
is mainly for small farm tractors, with width of 6 m and height of 2.7 m;
(3) Underpass for tractor ploughing and pedestrians is with width of 4 m and
height of 2.2 m.
In heavy hilly area, there are some overpasses with reinforced concrete hollow
plate of 16 m and 20 m long or 40 m rigid frame arch for superstructure and
substructure. The location and layout of the under passes for both pedestrians and
machines should determined after consultations with the local people and the under
passes should have enough clear height and width for future development.
9.5 Living stand assessment
9.5.1 To improve the people's living standard along the road area
The proposed road will promote the regional economic development, which will
improve the living environment and living standard.
The road project will give impetus to the multi industrial development and more
effective utilization of the local natural resources, providing more employment
opportunities for the local people. The improvement of the transport system brought
about by the proposed road will speed up inter regional and urban/rural commercial
and trade activities so that there will be more market supply and demand to meet
everyday life needs with more monetary income for the people.
63



The investment environment will be improved greatly due to the more efficient
transport system. Therefore more investment can be expected not only in energy and
communications,  but also in culture, entertainment, education, public health and
other public utility facilities, all of which shall be of great significance for
enhancement of the people's living standard.
The forecast of the living standard improvement for the people in the area
affected by the proposed road is summarized in Table 4-27.

9.5.2 Public health
The area along the proposed road is not an area with serious endemic disease. By
adhering to the principle of prevention first, before the construction team entering into
the area, it is necessary for them to go to the local hospital to understand the situation,
e.g. in the area lack of iodine, taking iodine added salt with iodine content of
1/10000 - 1/50000 or taking iodized potassium tablet or even injecting iodized oil
may be necessary. Since road construction team usually moves from place to place, so
long as proper measures having been taken, the endemic disease will not impact the
construction team workers.
As for the prevention of infectious diseases and the snail fever, it is better to be  N d
achieved by proper training with basic knowledge of the infectious diseases and
snail fever, and cultivating good hygiene habits.
For workers working at the construction site with high level noise or TSP
concentration, health care should be strengthened by regular physical health checkups.
During operation period of the road the public health will not be seriously
affected.
9.5.3 Risk assessment of dangerous goods transport
The risk arising from dangerous goods transport mainly comes from traffic
accident, which may cause exploding, fire or leakage of the dangerous goods and
environment pollution.
The proposed road is an important transport corridor for freight transport as well
as dangerous goods transport. In order to ensure transport safety the road transport
department will strengthen dangerous goods transport management and enforce
dangerous goods transport regulations set forth by the MOC. To timely control
possible pollutant emission caused by accident, fire-fighting and first aid teams should
be established with professional staff and special measures to timely clear and control
the pollution.
I  I 
It is proposed that special authority should be established responsible for
dangerous goods transport admninistration, including to conduct qualification test and
issue license to the carriers and the -vehicles, training of the drivers and the first aid
technicians, in order for them to grasp specialized knowledge to deal with any
incident or accident concerned with dangerous goods transport.
Enforcement of the dangerous goods transport regulations should be strengthened.
Special technology should be developed to monitor the conditions of the dangerous
goods while transported to prevent accident. Once accident happens the first aid team
should be informed in time and quick in response. Dangerous goods transport accident
report system should be observed strictly.
65



So long as the above mentioned measures having been taken, the risk of
dangerous goods transport will not be high. Even though the accident happens, the
leakage of the dangerous goods can be dealt with properly in time.
9.6 Land use                                         f
The grand total land area along the proposed road is 17442 6arfthe total land
occupied by the proposed road is 18009 mu, accounting for about 0.1% of the grand
total. So the road project itself has no significant impact on the land use condition.
Due to the significant social and economic benefits brought about by the road
project, the special value of the land occupied by the road will be materialized.
Meanwhile, after completion of the road, new industry belt will be formed along the
¢:c:'    road area. The land value in the area near the road will be increased. The new road
may have some impact on the land use pattern in a way that some farmland may be
.taken for industrial use. Therefore the land administration authority should strengthen
i the enforcement of the land law and related regulations.
9.7 Tourism, landscape and cultural relic
There is no large scale well developed tourist area along the road, but there are
rich historical and cultural tourism resources. The completion of this road project will
promote the development of the tourism resources along the road area. Due to the
improvement of the transport facility and economic development, there will be more
travel demand for different purposes, including entertainment and tourist.
The landscape along the road area is unique, with the terrain changing from heavy
hilly to slight hilly then to plain hilly area, characteristic of beautiful rural scenery.
The artificial modem road will be specially designed to be harmonized with the
natural scenery.
The radius of the circular curve have been reasonably designed for the proposed
road creating conditions for good comfortable alignment. It is proposed that in the
next stage design, long curve with large radius be adopted instead of long straight line
within the approved route corridor specified in the feasibility study report.
On the whole, the longitudinal alignment will be of high quality, which is
dominated by straight line with long and smooth grade.
Beautification of the large scale road structures, such as interchanges, extra-large
bridges, motorway service area, will greatly improve the travel environment for the
road users. Since proper measures have been taken into consideration, the completion
of the road project will not destroy the natural scenery, but to some extent will have
positive effects.
66



Since road side earth borrowing may spoil the natural environment, large scale | 
road side earth borrowing should be avoided. Road sections to tourist attractions
should be decorated with more green plants. Local maps, travel guide and tourist
information should be provided for the road users.
No important cultural and historical relics have been found along the road area, so
the road project will have no negative impact on the cultural and historical.relics (the
details seen the cultural relics report). Once any cultural and historical relics are found
during the construction period, the construction will be stopped immediately and
timely report to the Cultural Relic Administration Department to take proper
protection measures.
10. Proposals and Measures for Environment Protection
10.1 Design period
(1) Environmental factors should be taken into account in road alignment
selection, alternative design scheme comparison and modification, adhering to such
principles as bypassing the urban and densely populated area, reducing relocation and
resettlement work, reduce farmland occupation as much as possible.
(2) Road alignment should fit the variation of the terrain to reduce earth cutting,
to keep the natural conditions, fully taking into consideration of the "Surmmary of the
Provincial Coordination Meeting".
(3) Concrete measures should be taken for the road passing through the East-West  aZ 4 4 r.
lake flood discharge area subject to approval by the provincial and municipal flood
control headquarters.
(4) The noise and air quality sensitive areas such as residential area, school,
institution, hospital, etc., should be avoid in road alignment design.
10.2 Construction period
(1) Proper program for provisional land use should made before hand to reduce
temporary land use as much as possible, to shorten the occupation time, timely return
the land for original use. Protect the wild animals and plants, to reduce forest loss as
much as possible, when the road section passing through forest area.
(2) To reduce destruction of terrain and vegetation as far as possible, to enhance
utilization of the construction materials of earth, sand and stone, to reduce the wastes
to the minimum; For earth borrowing pit the Contractor should be responsible for
rehabilitation of the borrowing site by planting or necessary engineering measures,
such as, building sideslope for the wastes materials to meet the requirements of
stability and flood prevention, etc..
For road section with high filling and deep cutting, the earth side slope should be
compacted appropriately and reinforced by stones, limestone, retaining wall, with turf
67



and climber planted, to prevent soil erosion.
(3) Before entering into the construction area, the construction team should take
initiative to understand the situation of the local endemic disease through local
hospital, pay attention to dietetic hygiene, take iodine added salt and store the
standing medicines.
(4) Where residential area exists within a distance of 150 m (for large
construction machine, 200m) from the worksite, the construction time schedule
should be reasonably arranged and no working shift should be arranged from 22:00 to
6:00. The construction machines should be meticulously maintained to reduce the
noise as much as possible. Labour protection measures should be taken for the
workers working on-the-spot, by using of earplug, noise-proof cotton ear cover as
well as noise-proof head helmet or working shift alternation.
(5) Bitumen mixing plant should be set at wide and qpen area 250 Wn away from
residential area and should be equipped with fully closed dust-removing device. It is
necessary to prevent dust from flying over the work site.
(6) During the construction period of the bridge, it is forbidden to throw away or
pile up the wastes and the construction materials into the water body or the nearby
area, to prevent the water field or the water body from being polluted or obstructed.
Temporary drainage system should be built if necessary to discharge the wastes. The
earth side slopes should be timely compacted.
Construction engineering work being conducted over the river should be well
organized better with advanced equipment and technology, coordinating with
engineering ship in the river.
(7) Inform the public of the state policies concerning with land acquisition and
resettlement, listen to and take into account the public opinions, carry out state
policies and regulations.
(8) Personnel training should be provided and strengthened for the workers as
well as administrative staff and road engineers for better grasp of basic environmental
protection knowledge and its concrete application in road construction.
10.3 Operation period
(1) Underpasses, for the existing minor roads, pedestrian path, farm tractor road,
should be established for convenience of the local people. So far 340 underpasses
have been considered in design, with average of one underpass every 589 meters.
(2) The dangerous goods transport administration should be strengthened by strict
enforcement of related regulations concerned with dangerous goods transport and road
safety. The carrier and driver should be qualified through training. The dangerous
68



goods should be properly packaged, labeled and loaded. First aid team should be
organized for accident with professionals from related departments, such as fire-
fighting, public security, environment protection, hospital, transport administrative
authority, etc.. Vehicles used for 'dangerous goods transport should also be qualified
and checked regularly.
(3) Motor vehicles are the main mobile pollutant emission source in the operation
period. Proper administrative measures can be taken to reduce the emissions from
road traffic, such as, road side check to ban the use of vehicles with overage emissions,
encourage use of advanced emission cleaning technology and device, use of unlead
asoline, and proper traffic management.
(4) There will be some traffic noise impact on some sensitive spots along the road
area. Forecast shows that the noise level by the year of 2000, the daytime noise level
will be over the standard noise level limit of 60 d B(A) specified in the state standard
GB3069-93 at such spots as the Hanyang No.3 Second School, Liuhuan Primary
School, Xinfu Primary School, Liuwan Primary School. By the year of 2020 the noise
level at those spots will also be over the standard level limit.
Such measures as heightening the school yard wall and making the building
sound insulation by rehabilitating the road side doors and windows for the Wusicun
and Wanjiafan primary schools have been proposed. Noise barriers will be built for
schools close to the road, each one 150m long for Liuhuan Primary School, Xinfu
Primary School and Liuwan Primary School; and a 200m long one for the Hanyang
No.3 Second School. It would be better if flexible pavement is paved for the road
sections, about one kilometer each, close to the above mentioned schools. The
measures of heightening courtyard wall and replacing road side doors and windows
with sound insulation ones are also recommended for the residential buildings in
villages close to the road, such as Quanli, Xiaojialing, Jianguocun, Dingjiatai,
Xiahehuan mountain village, Bengjianyuan, Zhangwan, Dazhangguancun and
Hongguangcun, where the nighttime noise level is over the standard level, and more
vegetation should be planted around these buildings. For the residential buildings
within 220m  to the road side, environmental monitoring will be conducted,
meanwhile   above mentioned measures will be taken to mitigate the noise impact.
Of the to  170 villages in the assessment area along the proposed road, there are 161
villages hivebeen included in the resettlement program, so that no more mitigation
measures for these spots.
(5) During operation period, the daily average pollutant concentration for CO and
NOx will not be over the standard limit in the short and mid term for all the sections
along the road, however, in the long term period (by the year of 2020) the pollutant
concentration for NOx in the area at a distance of 15 -. 140m to the road center line
will be over the standard limit. Therefore the recommended protection measures
mainly include vehicle administration and traffic management, supplemented by road
69



side plantations of arbors and bushes to mitigate the pollutants emitted from the traffic
and also to decorate the road environment.
(6) To protect the public health along the road area, in addition to the measures
for the existing schools and resident areas, no more new schools and hospitals should
be built within 220m to the road side, and resident buildings should be built more than
1 OOm away from the road side or the interchanges or separate grade crossings.
(7)Proper drainage systems should be built at both sides of the road to ensure the
run-off water being not directly discharged into the road side farmland or pond. The
earth side slope should be protected and compacted.
Septic tank should be provided in the four service areas for treatment of the
surrounding sewage and wastes to reduce pollution.
(8) To harmonized the road structure with natural environment, artistic design
should be made for the buildings such as interchange, service area, toll station, etc.,
with trees, grass land and flowers, making the environment comfortable.
(9) To strengthen traffic management by forbidding unqualified vehicles with
overage emissions and noise levels on road. Road maintenance and management
should also be strengthened. Forest belt should be planted on both sides of the road
when conditions arise for some road sections.

According to the forecast, the noise level will not be over class IV standard limit
in the area over 50 m in the daytime, 200 mn at night, away from road side for the road
section of K29+100 - K59+200; as for air environment, the distance for the pollutant
concentration up to the standard limit is within 10 m for CO and within 50 m for NOx,
and there are similar ecological environrnent for the two alternatives, but since the
east link will pass through the town of Yangping and along the side of Huangmailing
mineral area with relatively more environmental sensitive spots and more noise, air
and ecological impacts, the west link scheme is better than the east link scheme.
2.1.2 Shanhe east link scheme and west link scheme
The east link scheme will avoid densely populated areas of towns and villages
with less resettlement and farmland occupation, so there will be relatively less noise,
air and ecological impact in the construction period and operation period; whereas for
the west link scheme the route will be close to towns and villages such as Yangjiasi,
Songlinzhen, Xiyanggang, Chanchuan, etc., with more environmental sensitive spots
and more air, noise and ecological impacts; therefore the east link scheme is better
than the west link scheme.
2.1.3 Wild Pig lake west link scheme and east link scheme
In terms of noise and air sensitive spots, there are less villages and resident areas
for the west link scheme, so that the west link scheme is better; and in terms of water
environment, since the east link scheme will cross over the confluence of the Fuhe
river and Lunhe river, there will be more impact in the construction period and
operation period on water quality; therefore the west link scheme is better.
2.1.4 Hanjiang -Caidian bridge location and Zhangjiatang bridge location
schemes
T-he ecological environment for these two schemes is similar. However, since
there are more noise sensitive spots and more impacts on water quality for
Zhangjiatang bridge location scheme, Caidian bridge location scheme is better.
2.1.5 Houguan directly through scheme, east link scheme and west link scheme
The ecological environment for all the three schemes is similar. However, the
noise and air sensitive spots are less for the directly through scheme than the two
other schemes, with less villages and resident areas passed by the route, therefore the
directly through scheme is better than the other two schemes.
2.1.6 Fenghuang mountain west link scheme and east link scheme
According to the forecast, the noise level will not be over class IV standard limit
in the area over 40 m in the daytime, 170 mn at night, away from road side for the road
section,; as for air environment, the distance for the pollutant concentration up to the
standard limit is within 10 m for CO and within 110 m for NOx, and the ecological
environment is similar, and in the operation period there is little difference in air,
noise and ecological impact for the two alternatives. In the construction period,
75



however, there are more impact on air quality for the east link scheme mainly due to
the pollutants and noise produced during the construction materials transport arising
from earth and stone cutting with relatively more ecological impact; therefore, the
Fenghuanh mountain west link scheme is better.
2.1.7 Schemes of Zhushan-Yongan, Quanli-Yongan and by use of national road
318
According to the forecas,t, the distance from the isopleth of 70 dB(A) to the
roadside in daytime for the road section is 40 m, the distance from the isopleth of
55dB(A) to the roadside is 170 m at nighttime; the distance for the pollutant
concentration up to the standard limit is within 10 m for CO and within 25 m for
NOx.
There are less villages and resident areas for Zhushan-Yongan scheme with less
environmental sensitive spots than the other two alternatives. There are more resident
areas for the other two schemes with some of the road sections having become streets,
therefore Zhushan-Yongan scheme will have less air, noise and ecological impacts
and is better than Quanli-Yongan scheme and the scheme by taking advantage of
national road 318.
2.2 Social economic benefit
2.2.1 Huanshui west link scheme and east link scheme
There are more terrain undulations for the east link scheme, and the route will
pass through the town of Yangping, interfering with the Huangmailing Phosphorous
Minerial Plant to some extent, so that there will be more resettlement work than the
west link scheme and more difficult for the resettlement. The local governments of
Xiaogan municipality and Dawu county agree with the west link scheme. Therefore
the west link scheme will be better.
2.2.2 Shawo east link scheme and west link scheme
The land occupation and resettlement for the east link scheme are less than those
for the west link scheme, with the details shown in Table 5-1. The resettlement work
for the west scheme is great and difficult with more cost, therefore the east link
scheme is better.
2.23 Wild Pig lake west link scheme and east link scheme
The land occupation and resettlement for the west link scheme are less than those
for the east link scheme, with the details shown in Table 5-1. The resettlement work
for the east scheme is great and difficult with more cost, therefore the west link
scheme is better.
2.2.4 Hanjiang Caidian bridge location and Zhangjiatang bridge location
schemes
The land occupation and resettlement for Caidian bridge location scheme are less
than those for Zhangjiatang bridge location scheme, with the details shown in Table
76



5-2. The resettlement work for Zhangjiatang bridge location scheme is great and
difficult with more cost, therefore Caidian bridge location scheme is better.
2.2.5 Houguanhu directly through scheme, east link scheme and west link
scheme
The land occupation and resettlement for Houguanhu directly through scheme are
less than those for the other two schemes, with the details shown in Table 5-2. The
resettlement work for the east link scheme and the west link scheme are greater,
therefore Houguanhu directly through scheme is better.

2.2.6 Fenghuang mountain west link scheme and east link scheme
T*he social economic impact for the two alternatives is similar, the only difference
is the total cost of the west link scheme is less that of the east.
2.2.7 Schemes of Zhushan-Yongan, Quanli-Yongan and by use of national road
318
There are more villages and resident areas for Zhushan-Yongan scheme with
more difficulties for land acquisition and resettlement, and the route will pass by the
Tushan Power Transmission Station with interference of high voltage electricity lines.
in Caidian area. The scheme by taking advantage of national road 318 is not in
conformity with Wuhan municipal road development program with land acquisition
and resettlement difficulties, therefore it will not be adopted. The Zhushan-Yongan
scheme has less resettlement work and less cost, so that it is better than the other two
schemes.
2.3 Comparisons in terms of engineering cost
2.3.1 Huanshui west link scheme and east link scheme
Table 5-1 shows the major engineering features of the two alternatives, from
which it can be seen that the west link scheme is little bit longer than the east link
scheme, with two more extra-large bridges over Huanshui river and relatively more
farmland occupation; but the west link scheme has such advantages as better terrain
conditions with less earth and stone work, having been avoided Dawu industrial area
78



at the east bank of Huanshui river with less resettlement; therefore the west scheme is
recommended.
2.3.2 Shawo river east link scheme and west link scheme
Table 5-1 shows the comparisons for the two alternatives, from which it can be
seen that the west link scheme is longer than that of the east link scheme by 0.92 km
with 392800 m3 more earth and stone work, 10260 m3 more for the drainage
protection engineering work, and CNY 92.12 million more cost; therefore the east
link scheme is better.
2.3.3 Wild Pig lake west link scheme and east link scheme
Table 5-1 shows the engineering comparisons for the two alternatives. It can be
seen that the east link scheme is longer than that of the west link scheme by 0.49 km
with 345300 rn3 more earth and stone work, 4070 m3 more work for the drainage
protection engineering work, and CNY 123.65 million more cost; therefore the west
link scheme is better.
2.3.4 Hanjiang Caidian bridge location and Zhangjiatang bridge location
schemes
Table 5-2 shows the engineering comparisons for the two alternatives, from
which it can be seen that the Zhangjiatang bridge location scheme is 5.239 km longer
than that of the Caidian bridge location scheme; therefore Caidian bridge location
scheme is better.
2.3.5 Houguanhu directly through scheme, east link scheme and west link
scheme
Both of the east link scheme and the west link scheme are longer than the directly
through scheme with more earth and stone work and more land occupation; therefore
the Houguanhu directly through scheme is better.
2.3.6 Fenghuang mountain west link scheme and east link scheme
Table 5-3 shows the comparisons for the two alternatives, from which it can be
seen that the west link scheme is 0.339 km shorter than that of the east link scheme,
with 158200 m3 less earth and stone work and CNY 9580000 less cost; therefore the
west link scheme is better.

2.3.7 Zhushan-Yongan Scheme, Quanli-Yongan scheme and the scheme by use of
national road 318
Table 5-3 shows that the Zhushan-Yongan scheme has 483300 m3 less earth and
stone work, 39160 m3 less drainage protection work, and CNY 16.62 million less cost
than the other two alternatives; therefore Zhushan-Yongan scheme is better.
3. Comprehensive Assessment and Recommendation
As mentioned above, on the basis of the comparisons in terms of environmental
benefit, social economic benefit, engineering cost, and resettlement cost, the Huanshui
west link scheme, Shawo east link scheme, Wild Pig west link scheme, Hanjiang
Caidian bridge location scheme, Houguanhu directly through scheme, Fenghuang
mountain west link scheme and the Zhushan-Yongan scheme are obviously better
than the others. Therefore the Huanshui west link scheme, Shawo east link scheme,
Wild Pig west link scheme, Hanjiang Caidian bridge location scheme, Houguanhu
directly through scheme, Fenghuang mountain west link scheme and the Zhushan -
Yongan scheme are recommended.

CHAPTER 6 BRIEF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
The environmental cost and benefit analysis for road engineering project deals
with many aspects, including the analysis of natural environment and social
environment along the proposed road. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis will
be adopted for the environmental cost and benefit analysis for this project, mainly
discussing the comprehensive benefits from the proposed road and preliminary
estimating the investment cost of the environmental protection for this project.
1. Social Benefit
1.1 The national road project III in Hubei province is an important part of the national
and Hubei provincial trunk road systems, of which the Beijing-Zhuhai motorway is
located in the middle of China, via Beijing, Hubei, Hunan and Guangdong; the
Shanghai-Chengdu (Hurong) motorway starts from Shanghai in the east coast to
Chengdu in the midwest, via Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Sichuan and etc..
On the whole, the proposed road is the link for the east and the west, the north and the
south in terms of the national economy layout as well as the important transport pivot
connecting with the domestic and international market.
1.2 The completion of the project will promote the industry development along the
areas, with more new industrial belt, including transport industry, manufacture and
processing industry, building industry, tourism, breeding industry, agricultural and
side line products, etc..
1.3 The construction and operation of the project will provide more employment
opportunities for the local people, to absorb and arrange large quantity of the surplus
farm labours and to help improve the people's living standard.
1.4 The completion of the project will greatly improve the road transport condition
along the road area, enhancing the transport capacity and service quality, providing
more convenient connections with other places, other transport modes of airports
inland waterway ports, railway stations, and improving road traffic safety.
1.5 The completion of the project will greatly improve the investment environment
along the road area, give impetus to commercial and trade activities, as well as
personnel and information exchange.
1.6 The completion of the project will make it possible to develop and use the local
natural tourist resources with rapid, direct, safe, comfortable travel service.
1.7 The completion of the project will improve the village and township development
along the road area, and change the situation of production output constrained by
inadequate transport conditions.
81



1.8 The completion of the project will diverge the traffic passing through the major
cities, and it will be better to mitigate the traffic congestion in the urban area, reduce
the environmental pollution, with the completion of the road sections of the Jiangxia
area project III Hurong east section and the Caidian area project III Hurong west
section.
1.9 Great importance has been attached to the environmental protection for this
project, and the effective environmental protection measures will enhance the local
residents' consciousness of environmental protection.
2. Economic Benefit
After the road being put into operation, the direct economic benefits brought
about by the road include the cost reduction of passenger and freight transport due to
the upgrade of road, the congestion reduction due to the diversion of traffic, transport
distance reduction, travel time reduction and speed increase for transport service,
speed up of working capital due to improvement of transport and commercial
efficiency, and benefits from reduction of traffic accidents, with the details listed in
Table 6- 1.

2. Environmental Monitor Program
2.1 Purpose and principles
86



P"7- -^f the environmentoi protection monitoring program is to supervise
the implementation of the environmenm?i protection measures; based on the
monitoring results to modify the environmental protection action plan, and to provide
information for the post assessment for the project. The principles to set forth the
environmenital monitoring program are in accordance with the main environmental
impacts in different forecast periods and the road sections possibly with pollution
indicators over the standard limits, with emphasis at each environmental sensitive
spots.
2.2 The purpose and item of the monitoring in different periods
The main environmental impact during the construction period includes TSP,
construction noise, bitumen smoke produced by the bitumen mixing plant, the
vibration caused by pile driving and the impact of bridge construction on river water
quality.
The environmental impacts in the operation period mainly are the vehicle
emissions, traffic noise, and the road surface run-off on the river water quality.
The monitoring items will be TSP, noise, COD,r, SS, BOD5 and oil in the
construction period; and NOx, CO, TSP, noise, COD,,, SS, BOD5 and oil in the
operation period.
2.3 Environmental monitoring organization
The environment monitoring program for this road project includes monitoring of
air, noise and water quality, with the details shown in Table 7-3, Table 7-4 and Table
7-5. It has consulted with the provincial communications department that the routine
environmental monitor work will be conducted by the unit under the communications
department, which is qualified for the monitor work. To ensure the implementation of
the monitoring program, the construction unit will sign the contract with each monitor
unit under the communications department for the environmental monitor work before
construction; the provincial motorway management bureau will sign the contract with
each monitoring station for the environrmental monitoring work before the road
project is handed over for operation.
2.4 Monitoring cost
The total monitoring cost for the main road is CNY 1970.8 thousand; and the
total monitoring cost for the connection road is CNY 200 thousand.
2.4.1 Air
The monitoring cost for air quality is CNY 200000 during construction period,
and CNY 1400000 during operation period, with a total of CNY 1600000.
2.4.2 Noise
The monitoring cost for noise is CNY 57600 during construction period, and
87



CNY 193200 during operation period, with a total of CNY 250800.
2.4.3 Water
The water monitoring cost is CNY 120000 during construction and operation
period.
To ensure implementation of the monitoring program effectively, necessary
personnel training is an important issue, which will be discussed between the
monitoring station (consignee) and the consignor. The monitor unit under the HPCD

etc., at different level. The local governments actively participate in the selection of
the road alignment and ask for the road passing through the areas under their
jurisdiction with preferential policy offered for the project.
During the preparation of the EIA report, many departments were visited,
including the local environmental protection bureau, local communications bureau,
agricultural department, statistics bureau, forest bureau, sanitation and antiepidemic
station, etc., with opinions and comments collected from the experts and the general
public. Meanwhile the significance and the outlines of the project have been made
known to and got support by the general public.
To fully understand the opinions and proposals from the general public and to
protect the public interests, different forms of the public participation work have been
conducted, including to get public opinions by inquiry form, small meetings and
discussions. To make the public participation more effective and more efficient, the
inquiry was made in different groups, as follows:
(1) Non-government organization;
(2) Enterprises and institutions;
(3) Local residents affected by the proposed road project.
The investigation covered the area along the road, including Dawu, Xiaochang,
Xiaonan region, Xiaogan city, East-West lake area, Caidian and Jiangxia. The inquiry
form used in sample survey is shown in Table 8-1. 95 inquiry forms have been
received for the proposed road project. The summary of the public inquiry analysis is
shown in Table 8-2.
The results of the investigation show that the general public and most of the
families, which are going to be resettled, along the proposed road area are looking
forward to the construction of the road. 100% of the people who hand over the inquiry
form in favour of the road project; 88% of the people aware of the resettlement and
compensation policy concerned with the road project; most of the people to be
resettled accept the resettlement arrangement. The public have shown great concern
for the environmental problem arising from the proposed road project, particularly the
noise impact. Most people suggest that green belt should be built along the road. 14%
of the people suggest that noise barrier should be built in noise sensitive areas to
protect people from being disturbed by the noise. 35% of the people expressed their
concern about the dust nuisance during the construction period. 18% of the people
93



concerned about the vehicle emission pollutants, which indicates the environmental
consciousness of the general public and should be taken into consideration seriously.
Besides, many people have realized that underpasses should be built near the villages
for convenience of the local farmers' farm work and daily life.

To further understand the public opinions on this road project, it is proposed that
the owner of the project should send the EIA report and the Action Plan for

environmental protection to the local areas along the proposed road (Dawu county,
Xiaochang county, Xiaonan region, East-West area, Caidian area and Jiangxia area),
to make the road project known to the general public and to get more feed backs to
enrich the action plan.
To sum up, the people along the proposed road area understand the great
significance of the project and actively support the project for promotion of the local
economic development. Therefore there is little problem for land acquisition and
relocation work. As for the environmental impact arising from the road project,
various measures have been proposed to reduce the impact and to protect the
environment. So long as these measures are to be implemented in the design,
construction and operation of the road project, the environmental impact problems
will be solved properly.
The land acquisition, relocation and resettlement are also important issues for the
people concerned. Thoughtful relocation and resettlement schemes and time schedule
should be programmed according to goverrnent policies and regulations, so as to
ensure the living standard being kept at certain level.

CHAPTER 9 CONCLUSIONS
1. Conclusions of EIA
1.1 Natural environment
The landforms features along the proposed road area are complex including heavy
hilly area, hilly area, plain, rivers and lakes, and arid regions. During the road
construction period, the land forms of some areas along the road will have change to
some extent, due to cutting and filling of earth and stone works. But this kind of
effects can be reduced to the minimum when engineering prevention and protection
measures are adopted in the road design, construction and operation stages
respectively, and the hidden peril of water loss and soil erision can also be eliminated.
The impacts of the road and the bridge construction on the water quality of the
rivers and the lakes along the proposed road are temporary and slight. There is no
conspicuous impacts on the water environment along the route during the road
operation period, which is supposed to be caused by the runoff from the pavement and
the sewage from the service areas.
1.1.1 Ecological environment
According to investigation, there is no any natural reservation area with rare wild
animals and primeval forest, nor is there any rare animals and plants or animals in
extinction lawfully protected by the state distributed in the area. The damage of the
plants within the road area during the road construction period can be rehabilitated
through green belt planting. The limited impacts on the wild animals will disappear
once the construction period is over. During the operation period, the impacts on the
wild animals along the road area are very small.
It has been considered in the road design to keep the route away from forests and
farmland, and to make use of waste land. Since most of the areas along the route of
the proposed road are uncultivated mountain area or waste lands, the overall impact
on the agricultural production along the proposed road area is very small. But for
some villages and farmers, some farmland will be lost, therefore proper relocation and
resettlement should be arranged.
After the road open to the traffic the lead pollutant from the vehicle emissions
will be not cause severe pollution to the soil along the road area. There are still
potential capacity for the land to bear the pollutant.
1.1.2 Noise
On-the-spot investigation shows that the noise level can be controlled below the
standard level limit.
The noise impact caused by the road construction is only temporary, and can be
controlled by the measures suggested in the Action Plan Report.
96



After the road open to traffic, the noise impact is mainly at night. With
implementation of the measures recommended in the Action Plan Report, the noise
level can be controlled below the standard level limit.
With the local economic development, traffic volume is increasing on the existing
road , such as the national road 107, if the proposed road is not going to be built, the
traffic noise over the existing road will be more serious with more negative impact.
Therefore the proposed road can improve the environment by mitigating the traffic
noise to some extent over the existing road.
1.1.3 Air environment
The air quality over the proposed road area, is good, with the measured
concentrations of the pollutants of CO, NOx, in the monitoring spots being below the
standard assessment limit; and the concentration of TSP is also below the standard
assessment limit except for some individual spots, which show that the air quality
along the road area is good. And there are still potential capacity for the air
environment to bear the pollutants of CO, NOx and TSP.
The air pollution during the road construction period is mainly caused by TSP
from the mixing plant.
The air pollution during the operation period in the long term is mainly caused by
NOx emitted from the traffic and the impact caused by the pollutant of CO is very
small. Therefore, 200 m long 30 m wide green belt will be planted for the road
sections near the Jinkou Medical Plant and the Baoxie air quality sensitive spots.
The motorway has the advantage of less pollutants from the traffic, so that the
construction of the proposed road will have the effect of improving the air quality
over the road area.
1.2 Social environment
The annual growth rate of GNP will be expected at 9.5% in the directly affected
area along the proposed road; that of the national income 8.5%; and that of the gross
output of industry and agriculture 10.6%; with those for the Xiaogan area being 9%,
8.6% and 11% respectively; those for the Wuhan city being 10.4%, 9.4% and 11.5%
respectively. The economic index for the directly affected area shall be 119.22%,
140.75% and 179.51% in the year of 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively; and the
people's living standard index 134.37%, 173.44% and 234.62% in the year of 2000,
2010 and 2020 respectively.
The proposed road project will have positive impact on the social economic
development, as well as people's living standard, along the road area. The
contribution of the road project to the social economic growti will be 18.95%,
97



22.72% and 27.32% in the year of 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively; the contribution
to the improvement of the people's living standard will be 21.35%, 28.00% and
33.18% in the year of 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively.
Compensations will be provided for the relocation of the houses, power
transmission stations, high voltage electric wire poles, low voltage electric wire poles,
telecommunication wire poles, etc., due to the construction of the proposed road.
There is no impact on the other facilities. However attentions should be paid to
protection of the Beijing-Guangzhou telecommunication cables for the engineering
project later on.
The permanent land occupation for this road project will be 16485.4 mu.
According to estimation, the land use value for road is 2.49 times higher than that for
farming. The road project will promote the tourism development along the road area,
particularly give impetus to the mineral development in the north area.
On the whole the proposed road project will not cause great pollution impact on
the -area enviromnent along the road. And the recommended scheme will produce
good environmental effect. Due to the great social economic benefits the road project
will bring about, it is necessary to construct the road as soon as possible.
2. Measures and Suggestions
2.1 To optimize the design, in order to reduce the negative impact caused by the road
project on the social economic enviromnent to the minimum
The alignment of the road avill be so designed that the environmental sensitive
spots will be avoided away from the road. Road aesthetics, environmental features,
overall land use development program, and various environmental protection
measures, such as green belt, noise mitigation measures etc., will be taken into
account in the design stage of the road project. Attentions will be paid to the drainage
systems of the road subgrade and pavement to prevent pollution caused by the run-off.
The location and structure of the bridges should not cause any negative impact to the
river and the environment.
The East-West lake area passed by the road is one of the floodwater storage area
at the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze river, and the alignment scheme of the
road has been examined and approved by the competent authorities of the municipal,
provincial and the center government. During the design period the impacts caused by
the road structures on floodwater storage function should be studied and the special
requirements from the water conservancy and flood control departments should be
fully taken into account.
2.2 All possible and reasonable measures should be taken in the course of road
construction and rehabilitation, to protect the environmental pollution caused by the
noise and the pollutants. Therefore, a reasonable environmental protection plan based
98



on this EIA report should be worked out and be implemented by the construction unit.
In order to prevent soil erosion of the land, river bed, the base of waterway and
drainage systems, and to prevent silt deposition, intercepting ditches should be
constructed together with road subgrade. If the construction site is by or near the river,
dam should be built to keep the const+uiction site to e sepaatd from the river so that
no deposit will be drained into the riyer. The water for agrezate washing or for other
construction works should be filtrated and settled. If bored piles have been adopted,
the waste silt generated by    ing shall be id  at a designated site by barge, so
that little impact shall be produced by the engineering dredge and the silt disposal. All
necessary measures should be taken by the construction unit to prevent waste water
containing pollutants and other visible suspension materials from being discharged
into the river, waterway, and existing drainage systems. The storage sites for the bulk
materials such as lime and cement should be set far away from the rivers or ditches.
Temporary sewage and waste water treatment system should be set up to treat the
waste water from the work site and the living areas. Only after the waste water has
been treated appropriately, can it be discharged into the rivers. The daily life garbage
should also treated to prevent pollution. Measures should be taken to control flying
dust in construction site and to prevent materials from flying or being spilt over when
they are stored or transported, to prevent air pollution. The storage sites for bulk and
easy-to-fly materials should be located in the leeward direction of the villages. In dry
season, water should be spread over such materials to prevent the dust from flying.
The bitumen mixing plant should be set at the place in the leeward direction of
resident area, in a distance of 300 m away. The mixing plant should be totally closed
and equipped with secondary dust removal equipment.
To effectively control the noise level, vehicle maintenance should be
strengthened, keep the construction machines away from the resident area or ban the
night work if the worksite is near the resident area.
One of the major environmental impact during the road construction period is the
vegetation damage caused by cutting/filling. The subgrade for most of the road
sections for the proposed road is constructed by filling. The earth borrowing sites
should be selected in consultation with the local government. For road sections with
great amount of cutting/filling work, reasonable time schedule should be programmed
and cutting/filling in rainy season, particularly in the heavy rainstorm season should
be avoided as far as possible.
In order to protect the environment of the earth, sand and stone borrowing site,
the near-by natural drainage system should not be damaged and no more erosion
effects should be added to the natural drainage system. Attention should be paid to the
changes of the river situation when sands are borrowed from the riverbed. The
location of quarry should be selected taking into consideration of environmental
protection.
99



Terraced platform method should be taken for the earth and stone cutting, and
discretional earth borrowing along the hillslope should be prohibited strictly. While
cutting/filling it is necessary not to damage the surrounding vegetation as much as
possible. After earth borrowing, the hilltop can be developed as forest land or arid
farmland. If water sources can be guaranteed, the large earth borrowing pit can be
developed as fishponds. There are several hilltops with poor fertility in Dawu county,
along the road area. So when selecting the earth borrowing sites, the land areas with
less production value should be chosen first, to reduce the impact on agricultural
output. At the earth borrowing site, supervisors should be on-the-spot, to ensure the
cultivated soil of 20cm- deep should be set aside and returned back for farm-use. If
there are great amount of waste soil have to be piled up, less vegetation should be
damaged; e.g. if there exists a waste pond, the fillings may go into the pond to make it
a farmland, which has the effect of not only reducing the soil erosion, but also
increasing farmland area.
The construction method for stone cutting should have no damnage to the subgrade
and the side slope, nor any harmn to the residents, livestock, buildings and other
facilities. The loosened stones at the side slope of stone borrowing site should be
cleared and stored in a safe place.
Storage of spoil soil should not pollute and block the irrigation ditches and
natural waterways. Unnecessary land occupation and affects to landscape should also
be avoided. The spoils from the hillslope should not damage the plants, farnland, and
other engineering structures; and the spoils alongside the river should not block the
river, or change the flow direction or increase the water level causing threat to the
farmland and buildings, and should not affect breeding of fish. If conditions arise, the
top surface of the spoil can be planted or leveled as farmland.
Proper underpasses should be built to provide paths for the local residents'
convenience. More underpasses are recommended to be added when it is possible.
For engineering cutting, it is necessary to abide by the "Law of the People's
Republic of China on Protection of Historical Relics", to protect the historical relics.
The policies for the resident relocation and resettlement should be made known to
the public and reasonable suggestions from the public should be accepted and adopted.
The living standard of the residents should not be lowered after the resettlement.
Meanwhile, training and education of basic knowledge of environmental
protection should be strengthened for construction workers so that environmental
protection as a basic state policy can be implemented throughout the whole
engineering construction process.
2.3 Monitor of vehicle emissions should be strengthened during the road operation
100



period so that the vehicles as the pollutant sources can be controlled. It should be
suggested that test equipment for vehicle emission and vehicle noise should be
available for random vehicle inspection. Supervision over vehicles carrying dangerous
materials should be strengthened and efficient emergency first aid program should be
worked out.
For road sections where the traffic noise is over the standard level limit, the
measures such as planting, renovation of windows and doors, as well as building of
noise barriers should be adopted to improve noise insulation efficiency and to provide
better environment for the resident areas and schools.
The newly developed resident areas should be built over 100 m away from the
road. Septic tanks should be set in the service areas to treat sewage. Trees should be
planted along the sides of the road, near by the sensitive areas and around the service
areas. Maintenance of the subgrade side slope and the road drainage systems should
be strengthened.
The environmental protection agencies under the road administration departnents
should be set up. Such agencies should be responsible for implementation of
environment monitoring program during the road construction and operation periods.
Based on the results from environment monitoring, implementation program and the
time schedule of the road area environmental protection can be adjusted. In order to
compensate vegetation damage caused by the road construction, design of road
planting engineering should be carried out as soon as possible, so that planting on the
side slope and road side can be guided by such rational and scientific design and the
ecological environment along the road will be recovered, improved and optimized as
earlier as possible. This will turn the idea of "Planting a route and benefiting a large
area" into reality in the road engineering project.
As mentioned above, the impacts of the proposed road project on the ecological,
acoustical and air environment can be controlled and compensated as long as
environmental protection consciousness can be strengthened in the road construction
and the measures proposed in the EIA report can be implemented. That is to say that
the proposed engineering project is feasible.
