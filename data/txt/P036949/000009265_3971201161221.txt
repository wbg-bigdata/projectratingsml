National Road Project III and
Junshan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Project
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
1. Background
1.1 The national road project III of Beiijng-Zhuhai national trunk road (including
Junshan Yangtze Bridge) in Hubei province is part of the "Two longitudinal and two
lateral" national trunk roads, which shall be built in the year of 2000 as planned by the
State Council. The Wuhan Junshan Yangtze River Bridge is an extra-bridge located at
the joint section of the Beijing-Zhuhai national trunk road and the Shanghai-Chengdu
national trunk road. In December 1992, the Hubei Provincial Communications
Administration commissioned the desk study on Hubei section of Beijing-Zhuhai
national trunk road. Therefore, in November 1993, the Hubei Provincial
Communications Planning and Design Institute (HPCPDI) completed the pre-
feasibility study report of Hubei section of Beijing-Zhuhai national trunk road. In
December 1993, the Hubei Provincial Planning Commission and the Hubei Provincial
Communications Administration submitted the proposal of the project to the State
Planning Commission. In September 1995, the additional report related to the two
sections of Shanghai-Chengdu route.
The HPCPDI conducted the "Pre-feasibility Study Report for Junshan Yangtze
Bridge" and the "Feasibility Study Report for the Engineering Work of Junshan
Yangtze Bridge". The Hubei Provincial Planning Commission submitted the "Written
Ask for Adoption of BOT for Wuhan JunshanYangtze Bridge Project" to the State
Planning Commission in October 1995.
1.2 Entrusted by the HPCPDI on behalf of Hubei Provincial Communications
Department (HPCD) in March 1994, the Highway Research Institute of the Ministry
of Communications (a First Class Certificate holder for environmental impact
assessment issued by the National Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter
NEPA)) undertook the environmental assessment study for the national road project
III. The "EIA Report for Hubei Province National Highway Project III" passed the
preliminary exmination by the Ministry of Comrmunications (MOC) in August 1996,
and passed the final examination by NEPA in October 1996, with official written
reply.
Entrusted by the HPCPDI on behalf of HPCD in May 1994, the Shanghai Ship &
Shipping Research Institute undertook the environmental impact assessment studv for
the Beijing-Zhuhai national trunk road Junshan Yangtze river bridge engineering
project. The "EJA Report for Wuhan Junshan Yanetze Bridge" passed the preliminary
exmination by the MOC in August 1996, and passed the final examination by NEPA
in March 1997, with official written reply.

3. Present Situation of the Environment
3.1 Landform and topographical features
The area along this route is vast with great landfonn fluctuations. From Dwu to
Xiaohe township of Xiaochang is heavy hilly area; from Fu river to Junshan is plain
lake area; and the other areas are plain hilly.
Soft soil is dispersed over this project area, so that there are about 22.7 km road
section of this project have to be treated artificially. Meanwhile, the ground surface is
characteristic of long time temporary water storage, with higher water table. The soil
quality is poor with great water content; therefore, the soil shall have to be transported
from a long distance for subgrade and pavement, which makes the engineering work
difficult and the cost up.
The geologic conditions of the area in the north of Fu river is quite good,
according to the investigation, no areas with poor geologic conditions, such as
landslide, rock slide, and soft ground, have been found. Ancient stratum has been
found from Dawu to Huayuan, with bedrock along the route shallowly buried and the
outcropping rock can be seen everywhere. The stratum from Huayuan to the north of
Fu river is dominated by the middle and ancient time Pleistocene series with hard soil
texture, along the route.  The slope the irrigation canals and ditches is not only steep
but also stable with high load capacity. The good geologic conditions provide reliable
subgrade for the engineering work.
The low-lying land in the road section from the south of Fu river to Junshan is
characteristic of short term deposit, soaked with surface water and underground water
for a long time, with soft soil texture and low load capacity, except for the highland of
Dushan, Hengshan, Zhashan. Junshan, etc. within Caidian area, which has relatively
good geologic conditions. The road section in the east of the West Lake area is mainly
soil ground with thick and deep soft soil layer. The sections from Quanli to Yangan
and from Jinkou to Baoxie belong to corrosion hilly area. Due to the corrosion by
surface runoff, the landscape with topographical features of hills zigzagged with
ditches has been formed. The average subgrade filling height shall be 3.5 - 4 meters.
The section along the route is dominated by soil ground with relatively good geologic
conditions with a few rocks; and poor geologic conditions having not been
discovered.
5



3.2 Meteorology and hvdrology
The impact areas of this project are located in the middle and low latitude,
belonging to tropical continental monsoon humid climate featured with clear four
seasons, long frost-free period. The annual average temperature is 15 - 17 °C: and the
annual average rainfall is 1100 - 1450 mm. The rainfall in sunimer is up to 430 - 530
mm, accounting for 36 - 45% of the yearly total, with the rainfall in June being the
most, followed by that in spring 330 - 490 rrmm accounting for 29 - 36% of the yearly
total; that in autumn is 100 - 240 mm accounting for 17 - 19% of the yearly total; that
in winter is 90 - 160 mm accounting for 8 - I I%.
The areas along this route are abundant in surface water, with crisscross rivers
and lakes, reservoirs and ponds spread everywhere, with rich run-off.
The flow direction of the Yangtze River in this area is from southwest toward
northeast. The statistics show that the annual water flux of the Yangtze River is 660
billion cubic meters. At normal water level, it is usually 1000 - 1700 meters in width
and 17 - 26 meters in depth, with the maximum flow rate being 78800 m3/s and the
minimum 4060 m3/s. The historic record highest water level at the bridge site is 27.64
meters and the lowest 10.08 meters, with the annual average 19.15 meters.
The major water resources in the areas along the route is of good quality and are
the main water source for industrial and agricultural production. The daily life
drinking water is mainly from the underground and the water quality is good.
3.3 Socio-economic conditions
Along the proposed road and the road section where the Yangtze River bridge
shall be located, there are Dawu countv, Xiaochang county and Xiaonan district
originally under the jurisdiction of Xiaogan prefecture; and the east of the West Lake
area, Caidian area, and Jiangxia area under the jurisdiction of Wuhan municipality.
According to the statistics, in 1992 the total area of Xiaogan prefecture and Wuhan
municipality is 20024.11 square kin, accounting for 10.7% of the provincial total, with
population of 12.3869 million, accounting for 22.5% of the provincial total, and the
density of population is 619 person/km2.
The Dawu county, within the area along the route, is the under-developed poor
mountain area in Hubei province. In 1993 the per capital income for the local farmer
is only CNY 625.27. The income for those in Xiaochang, Xiaonan, the east of the
West Lake area, Caidian and Jiangxia within the directly affected area by the project is
highcr than the provincial average.
3.4 The eco-environment
The area along the route of the project has been relatively developed with manrv
human activities. The original vegetation in the area has been destroyed and evolved
into second growth and artificial vegetation. The standing timber in the area along the
6



route is dominated bv masson pine and Chinese fir; and the grain crops mainly are rice.
wheat, barley, beans, and others; the main economic crops include cotton, rape,
sesame, peanut. and tobacco; in addition, there are certain arnount of tea. mulbernr.
fruit and vegetable along the area.
The proposed road shall not pass through any national or provincial natural
reservation area. In the area within 500 meters from both sides of the road, no rare
animal or plant lawfully protected by the state has been found.
The Yangtze River is the part of the habitat and pathway for river migratory
fishes. Class I national conservative aquatic fauna such as white-flag dolphin (LVM).
Chinese sturgeon (ASG) and Chinese paddlefish (PGM) can be found in Wuhan
section, where Junshan Yangtze River Bridge is located, but it is not the major habitat
area for these animals. The number of these precious aquatic animals is very small and
they rarely occur in the river section where Junshan bridge is located. Further
investigation of the conservative aquatic fauna shall be made with a special report to
be submitted to the World Bank.
3.5 Tourist attractions and culture relics
In the area along the proposed road, there are many tourist attractions, with
prosperous prospects. According to the investigation conducted by the Cultural Relics
Archaeological Research Institute of Hubei Province, there are two ancient cultural
relics in the proposed road area, i.e. Buddhist Monk Tomb and Zhuge City Ruins. The
Buddhist Monk Tomb is located in the northeast of Bashi village, Wangdian township
Xiaochang county of Xiaogan municipality, with the proposed highway involved area
being about 600m2. Zhuge City Ruin is located in the south of Zhuge villages
Huanglin township, Caidian district of Wuhan municipality, with the proposed
highway involved area being about 240m2.
3.6 Air quality
According to the surveys in the recent years, the statistics analysis results show
that the densities of SO2, NOx, TSP and CO in the air along the proposed project area
of Dawu, Xiaogan, and Caidian, are all up to the Class II of the national air qualitv
standard. 30 spots were set up to monitor the air quality conditions along the proposed
road for measurement of CO, NOx, and TSP. The results showed that all the densities
for 'Ox an CO were up to the standard of Class 11, except for TSP measured in fcz\-
individual spot. Therefore the air environment condition is good enough for The
construction of the road and the bridge project.
3.7 Noise and vibration
According to the measured results at 26 monitor spots along the proposed project
area, the noise levels in the daytime and night were all below the State standard level.
except for that at individual spot, which shows the good condition of acoustic
environment.
7



According to the rmeasured results at 6 monitor spots along the proposed Junshan
bridge project area, the ground surface vibration is small, all below the standard limit,
which shows the good condition of the environment.
3.8 Water resources and water quality
The area along the proposed project is located in the east part of Hubei Province,
the middle reach of the Yangtze River, and the east side of Jianghan plain area, with
average annual rainfall of 1100 - 1450 mm for many years. The area is abundant in
surface water, with crisscross rivers and lakes, reservoirs and ponds spread
everywhere, with rich run-off. In the area there are Huan river, Fu river, Lun river,
Wild Pig Lake, Wangmu Lake, Hanjiang river, Hougong Lake, Tongshun river, the
Yangtze river etc. According the measured results by the Xiaogan Environmental
Monitor Station, the water quality in the area is up to the correspondent standards,
except for that of the Wild Pig Lake, which is polluted by oil. Therefore the water
quality along the project area is fine.
The measured results got from the monitor spots near the bridge site along the
Yangtze River showed that all the 4 of the 6 measured factors: PH, BOD, Oil, and
Permanganate Index wete up to the Class I - II standards, which meet the assessment
standard. SS is seriously over the standard, because the Yangtze River is a high silt
bearing river.
3.9 Soil erosion and soil pollution
Comprehensive investigation and analysis show that in the assessment area of the
proposed project, serious soil erosion has been found in Dawu county, with the
erosion rate over 5500 tons ' (km2   year), annual growth of soil erosion about 21.8
thousand ton, annual growth of soil erosion area about 10.3km2, and the soil erosion
area accounting for 25% of the total natural area. The soil erosion in the project area
of Caidian district, Jiangxia district, the east of the West Lake area is less serious,
with the erosion rate about 1000 tons / (km2 . year) the erosion area accounting for
5% of the total.
According to the measured results from the 7 monitor spots along the proposed
road project, the organic contents in the farm land soil were below the provincial
average. The fertility of the soil is at the lower middle level in terms of organic
content. The measured PH results (6.85 - 7.52) show that it is neutral, suitable for
farm crops. The measured Pb content was close to the geological average of that in
Hubei Province, which belong to non-pollution class far from the critical content of
300 mg/kg, which indicates a very small accumulation of lead.
3.10 Transport
The transport system in the proposed project area has been developed to some
extent, with crisscrossed railways, highways, inland waterways and airlines. The
Yangtze river and Hanjiang river are two golden waterway along the project area.
8



passing through most of the economically developed areas in China. Wuhan Port has
become a key hub of waterway transport with Shanghai downstream in the east and
Chongqing up stream in the west, and a modern port city for combined transport of
inland waterwav barge and ocean shipping. Due to the recent years economic
development, the traffic volume has been increasing and the road capacity can not
meet the demand, with road traffic conditions deteriorating with each passing day. To
improve the current situation, it is necessary to have the project for the economic
taking off along the project area.
4. Expected Environmental Impact and the Protection Measures
According to road project EIA, protection and mitigation measures, and the
environmental action plan, the presentation and implementation of the expected
environmental impact, and the protection measures shall be in three stages as follows,
and the key EAP factors are set out in Appendix I.
4.1 Design period
(1) Reasonable route selection
The route scheme selection shall be based on technical standard, taking into
considerations of such factor as cost, farmn land occupation, impacts on farm land,
schools, resident areas, culture relics, irrigation and flood control, risk probabilities,
resettlement, coordination with local development planning program, building
material sources and processing work site selection, etc.. The route selection shall
follow the principle of "close to but not get into the urban area". The public opinions
shall be fully taken into account, including those from local government, the industrial
enterprises, to make the route to be away from built-up areas.
(2) Public convenience
The partition effects caused by the road project shall bring inconvenience for the
local people. The location and the class of the underpasses shall be decided through
consultations with the local communities, as well as the local governments and parties
interested, to adapt to the current conditions.
A total of 352 underpasses shall be set out. The connection road is second class
road with mixed traffic.
Based on the principles for the underpass design set forth in the "Engineering
Feasibility Studv". underpass shall be classified into three classes, as shown in Table 1.
When condition allows, the underpass shall go dowrward at a depth of less than one
meter. with drainage. Water shall be drained into the cvaporation pool or the side
ditches (or deep borrow pit). The downward underpass section shall have concrete
pavement. In addition, a number of large, median and small bridges shall be available
for the local pedestrian and vehiicles traffic.
9



(3) Flood control
This road section is characteristic of crisscrossed and densely distributed rivers,
lakes and reservoirs, pools. Tongshun river is a seasonal river, and Fu river is a
mountain river. The main rivers crossed over by this road section include Huan river,
Fu river, Lun river, Hanjiang river, Tongshun river, Yangtze river, etc. 6 extra-large
bridges, 28 large median and small bridges, 711 culverts will be built; for the
connection road 13 large medium and small bridges, and 73 culverts will be built, for
flood control in rainy season. The subgrade and the surface drainage systems have
been included in the engineering design for protection of road from being damaged bv
flood.
Table 1 Underpass classification and its layout principles
Class Width (m) Clearanice (mi)                Layout principles
l     8.0       3.5    Maior crossed county & township roads, mainly for vehicle & tractor traffic
1I    6.0       2.7    Major crossed village & farmland roads, mainly for small tractors & farm truck
III    4.0      2.2    Crossed farmland paths, for pedestrians
The flood discharge capacity has been fully taken into consideration in the design
of the proposed road. Two flood gates have been set at the middle and lower stream of
the Hanjiang river, which make the peak flood flow under control. Since part of the
well irrigation system will be partitioned due to the construction of the road, proper
measures will be taken to meet the irrigation needs. For the rivers crossing the road
section and the irrigation system fed with river water, the water tunnels will be
designed based on the existing irrigation system. Double or three hole tunnels will be
set for major irrigation channels for both pedestrian and water passage. These
measures will protect the original irrigation system in the best possible way.
(4) Cultural relics protection
So far there are two cultural relics have been found in the proposed project land
use area, with total involved area of 840m2. The construction work of the road section
involved with the relics shall not start until the excavation work for the relics have
been completed. During the construction period, it is necessary to require the
contractor to pay attention to the protection of the relics. Once any cultural relics
unexpected before are found. construction shall stop immediately and the relic site be
under protection, in which case the relics administration authority shall be informed in
due course. Then decisions shall made by the authority to excavate the relics or to
bypass the relics site.
(5) Reduce land occupation
Most area of this project are located in the Hanjiang plain area. Thc main
engineering work shall need 22118700 cubic meters of earth and stone materials. The
major borrow earth and stone cut shall be near by the both side of the route or 15 km
away in the two directions of the road, with less farmland occupation as much as
possible. Since this area is characteristic of more population and less farmland, in the
10



preliminary desian reasonable measures such as taking advantage of the near by
barrens.
(6) Land acquisition and resettlement
It has been emphasized in the feasibility study and the preliminary design the
principles which shall be followed in the route selection, i.e. to be away from the
urban area as much as possible, to reduce resettlement as much as possible, and to
reduce farmland occupation as much as possible, etc.. Therefore the number of the
resettlement of the houses shall be 160, with building area of 156111.9 m2. A
resettlement agency shall be established in Dawu, Xiaochang, Xiaonan, the east of the
West Lake area. Caidian district and Jiangxia district by the project owner,
responsible for land acquisition and resettlement, so that the land acquisition and
resettlement can be accomplished before the project contractor entering into the
construction site. Meanwhile, an independent supervision agency shall be set up
composed of social scientists, responsible to supervise resettlement and compensation
implementations to protect the interests of the affected people. The details are set out
in the resettlement action plan (RAP).
(7) Dust or air pollution
The service area of the road shall be 100 meters away from the road center. The
road administration building shall be 200 meters away from the separate grade
crossing. To prevent the dust arising from the stone cutting, borrow pit, and the
mixing plant affecting the sensitive resident areas, the above mentioned work site has
been properly selected far away from resident areas.
(8) Water pollution
A total of five service and rest areas shall be set for the whole section. In the
service area there should be waste water treatment equipment, to prevent the waste
water from being discharged into the water area for public use. Only after having been
treated can it be discharged for public use.
(9) Noise barrier design
A total of 5 noise barriers shall built for the whole section, with total length of
1500 meters, 3 meters high, and with estimated cost of CNY 1.5 million. The impact
of the noise barrier on the pavement water discharge will be considered in the desigcn
of the noise barrier, with the details shown in "Environment Protection Design'".
4.2 Construction period
(1) Noise impact
'The noise during construction period mainly comes from the construction
machines and transport vehicles. Long time exposure to intense noise environment
shall cause many kinds of illness for human body, including deaf. The noise related
deaf usually is in connection with noise level as well as the duration for the person
exposed to the noise. For hurnan being's health, according to the "Industry and
II



Enterprise Noise Hygiene Standard", reasonable working shift shall be arranged, to
reduce the time for the workers to be exposed in the noise environment, or by
changing work shift so as to have time to recover his/her hearing abilitv. Meanwhile.
proper maintenance of the construction machines is important to keep the noise in
lowest possible level. For those working close to the noise source, such labour
protection measures as wearing noise proof-earplug , head helmet, shall be adopted,
with work time reduced properly.
Since human body is sensitive to noise, to guarantee the night rest for the
residents close to the work site, the construction machines shall stop working in the
work site, which is less than 200 meters away from the resident area, from 22:00 at
night to 6:00 in the morning.
The noise from road construction machinery is characteristic of abrupt, irregular,
discontinuous, and high intensity, which can be mitigated by changing its operation
manner, such as the machine with high intensity noise can be used in the day time
(6:00 - 22:00) or the work time for various machines can be properly arranged. The
noise stemming from transport and other work can also be reduced or mitigated
through improved management and training.
(2) Impact of air pollution
The air pollution during construction period mainly comes from lime and soil
mixing, running of different vehicles on the work site. In addition, the loading and
unloading of the cement concrete mixer and the road construction materials also
produce dust. To mitigate dust pollution at the construction site, the following
measures shall be adopted:
- Close system should be equipped for the mixers. The mixing plant shall be
installed with two stage dust remove device. Health care shall be provided for the
employees. The mixing plant shall be located 500 meters away to the leeward of the
sensitive areas.
- Watering treatment on the construction site, particularly such places as the
mixing plant, cement concrete storage and mixing site, etc.
- While filling and compacting proper watering shall be needed for compacting,
afterwards frequent watering shall also be necessary to prevent dust flying.
- The contractor shall be responsible for proper management of bulk building
materials, the storage of which shall be at least 500 meters away from residential areas
and the material shall be covered when it is stored in the open air. The borrow earth
shall be gathered together for filling; after completion of the engineering work, the
borrow earth shall be filled back to the borrow cut.
(3) The disposal of the wastes from the labour camp and the construction site
shall be the contractor's responsibility. It is necessary for the wastes to be gathercd
together for disposal or treatment regularly; particular attention shall be paid for the
waste water while the construction site is close to the rivers, such as the construction
12



site for Hanjiang river bridge, Fu river bridge. and Tongshun bridge. Most solid
wastes are the packages and the residuals of the materials, which also shall be timely
gathered and disposed all together. Training shall be done before hand, and regular
check and examination shall be made during construction period.
(4) Traffic management during construction period
Most of the sand and stone materials shall be transported via county or township
roads to the construction site. There are also other materials such as steel. cement, etc..
which shall be prepared or purchased. To prevent road traffic jam, it is necessary to
strengthen traffic management for the project owner and the contractor in cooperation
with the local public security bureau, traffic administration department, waterway
management department so as to smooth the traffic and keep the work going on
properly.
The temporary road built for the project by the contractor shall be principally on
the right of way of the one side of the constructed road. If more land area is needed,
the contractor shall apply to the project owner for approval and the owner shall be
responsible for completion of the land acquisition procedure; and the supervisory
engineer shall be responsible for the supervision of the implementation of the
temporary road land acquisition and road construction.
The traffic management action plan is as follows.
- To smooth the traffic on the existing road, temporary road shall be built, where
the constructed road intersected with the existing road. Generally the temporary road
shall be located at one side of the existing road. After the separate grade crossing
having been completed and open to traffic, the temporary road shall be modified in
due course.
- Since the road traffic is busy, strengthening traffic management shall be
necessary during the construction period, including time schedules for particular
traffic, such as night operation for some material transport. Therefore it is better for
the contractor to make transport planning.
- To prepare the materials in advance, such as sand and stone can be transported
in off peak season of the road traffic.
- The traffic administration department shall cooperate with the relevant parties to
smooth the traffic, particularly when accident happens.
(5) Measures to prevent the water body from being polluted by hazardous
materials
The runoff may be hazardous to the water body, mainlv due to such materials as
bitumen. limestone, etc., ws%hich might be mixed with the rain-water. Therefore proper
management of the storage of these materials can be effective.
Even though, the soil erosion caused by cutting and filling for this project is not
serious, the contractor shall pay attention to the soundness of the drainage system.
13



Temporarv deposition pool shall be set when it is necessary to prevent the river from
being blocked by the discharged soil.
During the construction period of the bridge, the boring pile construction process
shall be adopted for under water pier construction, which can significantly reduce the
impact on the water quality caused by the substrate silt resuspension . The waste silt
generated by drilling shall be disposed at a designated site by barge, so that the water
pollution caused bv the silt can be reduced to the minimum.
Personnel training for the employees shall be carried out to avoid abnormal oil
leakage from piling driver as much as possible.
(6) Protection of eco-system
To protect the forest resources from being damaged, it is forbidden to get
borrowing earth from the forest or set labour camp and material storage in the forest.
During the construction period, a separation belt shall be set to forbidden anybody
entering into the forest area. After the construction, any damage to the vegetation shall
be restored or rehabilitated.
The borrow earth shall not be taken from the farmland as far as possible. If it is
necessary, the surface soil in a thickness of 30 cm shall be preserved in one place,
which shall be filled back timely after the construction, to make the impact on the eco
and agricultural system to the minimum.
Proper measures shall be taken for the contractor to reduce the time of land
occupation and to enhance the consciousness of environment protection by education
and training.
The borrow cut, the fill back and the naked land shall be timely reinforced during
the construction. After completion of the earth work, quick growth grass seeds or turf
shall be planted to protect the side slope.
To stabilize to subgrade, motar slab combined with grass or totally covered grass
slope can be used to protect the filled side slope. For the cut side slope, shotcrete,
molar slab, etc. surfacing technology can be used for protection. Subgrade protection
can be done together with the engineering work and implemented by time schedule.
Many years investigation and study on the eco-system of the middle and the lower
reaches of the Yangtze River show that the rapid reduction of the number of the rare
aquatic animals such as white-flag dolphin, Chinese sturgeon and Chinese paddlefish
in the Yangtze River is mainly due to unlawful fishing and the waterbome transport
development. The construction of the bridge shall neither do harm to the aquatic
animals nor change their living environment.
14



The boring pile construction process shall be adopted for the deep water pier
construction, which can significantly reduce the negative impact caused by the
substrate silt resuspension . The waste silt generated by drilling shall be disposed at a
designated site by barge, so that little impact shall be produced by the engineering
dredge and the silt disposal.
The substrate silt quality at Wuhan section of the Yangtze River is fair, small
amount of silt resuspension caused by dredging shall not result in serious pollution.
The sewage generated by the labour camp shall not be discharged directly into the
nver, and shall be collected in designated place on the bank for treatment and disposal,
to protect the aquatic animals from being affected by polluted water.
The environment protection consciousness of the workers shall be enhanced
through education and training in cooperation with aquatic ecological experts and
experienced fisherman. Once any rare aquatic animal is found passing by the
construction site water area, necessary measures shall be taken accordingly.
(7) To implement the "three simutaneousness"
The waste water treatment facility, green belt, the noise barrier, the combined
windows and heightened walls surround the house shall be designed by the contractor
according the requirements. The details are shown in the "Environmental Engineering
Design Documents". If the requirements of the "three simutaneousness" can not be
met, the project shall not be accepted and put into use.
4.3 Operation period
(1) Traffic noise control
The management of road traffic, transport and road maintenance shall be
strengthened during the operation period, jointly by NEPA, local EPB and local traffic
management department of public security bureau. Over sized or over loaded vehicles
shall not be allowed to operate on the road. According to the "Environmental Noise
Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations of the People's Republic of China",
'the motor vehicles operation on road shall equipped with muffler and the horn in
conformity with specified specifications, and shall keep in good condition of technical
performance. The noise level produced by the vehicle shall not above the standard for
motor vehicle noise emission. Those do not comply with the vehicle noise emission
standard shall not be given the operation license." Table 2 shows the allowed noise
level for motor vehicles.
According to forecast the traffic noise will not be over the GB3096-93 standard
level of Class 4, in short term, mid term and long term, with the daytime 70dB
isopleth being 60 m from the center. In short term, the nighttime 55dB(A) isopleth
will be   100 m from road side for road section of Quanli-Yongan, Shenshan-Baoxie.
Dawu-Hanlao, Hanlao-Sancha and Sancha-Quanli; and the nighttime 55dB(A)
isopleth will be 120 m from road side for road section of Quanli-Shenshan. Table 3
shows the noise level overage at the sensitive spots along the road section.

(2) Vehicle emission control
According to the forecast, the daily average and anytime measured pollutant of
CO concentration along the proposed road side is not over the limit of class II
standard of the State air envirornment standard. But the daily average concentration of
NOx will be over the standard level in some area, which will be at road section of
Hangyang No.3 High school, Zhuge City, Citangwan, Qianjialing and Shangzuowan
by the year of 2020. Therefore, during the operation period the impact of vehicle
emission on the sensitive spots will be relatively small.
The trucks loaded with bulk fine materials shall be covered with canvas to
prevent the materials from being spilt over the road or in the air.
To reduce the air pollution, at the sensitive road section with overage of NOx,
such as Junshan Yangtze river bridge at K1 77+600, green belt may be established.
Trees shall be planted on both sides of the road to adsorb harmful gas. The
evergreen broadleaf tree is the best followed by coniferous tree and deciduous tree in
terms of their adsorption capability. Therefore such trees as camphor, Chinese
littleleaf box, etc. shall be planted along side the road. On the side slope turf shall be
planted combined with other plants to beautify the environment.
For each road section of Hangyang No.3 High School at K162+400, Zhuge City
at K166+400 and Huanjiawan at K177+600, where overage of air pollutants is
forecasted, a 200 m long 20 m wide green belt will be built respectively to reduce the
impact by vehicle emissions and noise. The cost is estimated about CNTY 500
thousand.
(3) Maintenance of drainage system
In the beginning of the operation period, part of the drainage system may be partly
blocked by dust and sand deposits due to action of seasonal showers on side slope and
pavement. Therefore regular maintenance of the drainage system shall be necessary.
Particular attention shall be given to the raining water logging in the underpasses
caused by heavy showers.
Motar slab paving shall be used for drainage outlet and the side ditch to prevent
water erosion and the small wvaterfall effect. Meanwhile bulk material transported by
open truck shall be covered.
(4) Public campaign
Public campaign for clean road shall be necessary to ban discarding litters on
road.
(5) Traffic management
To prevent spilling of the bulk materials transported by open truck, necessary
18



package shall be used. Road side check of the truck loading conditions at the toll
station shall be made.
(6) Local development planning
It is recommended to the local urban and township development planning
authorities that no more schools and hospitals should be built within areas 200 m from
road side. Newly built resident areas and other buildings should be 100 meters away
from the main road and interchange; as for the connection road, no more schools and
hospitals should be built within 50 meters from the road side.
5. Alignment and Bridge location
Preliminary route aginment was identified in the feasibility study stage, with 7
section schemes considered and 2 bridge location schemes for Junshan Yangtze river
bridge compared in terms of engineering, economic, environmental and social factors,
taking into account of opinions from both local people and government departments,
as the result of which is the present alignment.
For example, there were schemes of Beijing-Zhuhai route passing through
Caidian Houguan area, Houguanhu lake east route, Houguanhu lake west route and
Houguanhu lake direct through route. Although the east route scheme has one bridge
opening span less for the lake crossing bridge with good transport condition, the land
form fluctuates greatly making horizontal and longitudinal alignment difficult and
longer in length with more resettlement work. The west route scheme has less
resettlement work, but the geological condition is relatively poor with less detour road
for construction and with great amount of earth and stone work. Although the direct
through scheme increases the bridge span, the total route length is the shortest with
smooth alignment and with the least earth and stone work, less resettlement work, less
land occupation and less environmental impact. Therefore, the direct through scheme
is recommended.
For the west link of Hurong (Shanhai-Chengdu) route, Yongan-Zhushan section,
Yongan-Quanli section scheme has been selected, with 2.6km less in length,
15705.4m less house relocation, 1158 less people affected, 66 sites less power supply
facilities' relocation.
For the bridge location of Junshan Yangtze bridge, there were schemes of
Weijiawan location and Houshan location. The Weijiawan location has been
recommended after assessment and comparisons in terms of engineering geology,
navigation impact. land acquisition and resettlement as well as environmental factor.
6. Environmental monitor
To mitigate pollution, to supervise implementation of environrnent protection and
19



mitigation measures, to check the environmental forecast and to timely modifv
environrnent protection measures based on monitoring results during the construction
and operation period, an environmental monitoring plan has been set forth for this
project. According to the monitoring plan, monitor of noise, air environment and
water quality during the construction and operation period shall be contracted out by
the local EPA, for road sections with possible overage of the standard limits
particularly for the sensitive spots. The details of the monitor plan are listed in
Appendix I Envirornental Monitoring.
7. Environmental Administration Organizations and Personnel Training
Organization and administration of environmental protection work for this Project
are as follows. There are administration agency, excutive agency and environment
monitor agency. Figure I shows the organization chart for the Project III. Figure 2
shows the organization chart for the Junshan bridge project. Figure 3 shows the report
procedures for environmental monitoring work for Project III. Figure 4 shows the
report procedures for environmental monitoring work for Junshan Bridge project.
The environmental monitoring shall be the responsibility of highway
environmental monitor unit and the supervision engineer. The World Bank Project
Office of HPCD is responsible for the construction period monitoring plan for the
Project III; the World Bank Project Office of HPCDand the Junshan Bridge BOT
Project Corporation are responsible for the Junshan bridge environmnental monitoring
plan. In the operation period Hubei Provincial High-grade Highway Management
Bureau (HPHHMB) is responsible for the monitoring plan for the Project III. The
World Bank Project Office of HPCD and the Junshan Bridge BOT Project
Corporation are responsible for the Junshan bridge in the operation period. The The
provincial EPA shall be responsible for routine supervision, and the local EPA for
local environmental protection issues in local areas within its jurisdiction, according
to EAP and relevant laws and regulations. Environmental protection monitoring plan
is summarized in Appendix II.
The training program includes domestic training and training going abroad, as
follows:
(1) One month going abroad training of 5 persons for from environmental
administration organization, with estimated cost of USD 7.5 thousand per man-month,
making a total of 5 x 7.5 = 37.5 thousand (USD) (equivalent to about CNY316.25
thousand);
(2) Half month domestic training of 36 persons for environmental monitor work,
with cost estimation of USD1.2 thousand per man-month, making a total of 36 x 0.5
x 1.2=21.6 thousand (USD) (equivalent to about CNY179.3 thousand).
The grand total raining training cost is about CNY 495.55 thousand.

8. Public Participation
To carry out the project in the best possible way, many meetings for the public
participation have been held organized by the environmental assessment unit
cooperated with the project owner and the design unit. The representatives of the units
the interested parties along the project areas attended the meetings, to discuss such
issues as the alignment scheme of the project, the location of the interchanges, and
major environmental concerns, with  suggestions and  recommends. Meanwhile
investigations were made on the socio-economic status and the opinions of the
affected communities and the non-government organizations on the project and the
resettlement arrangements. The public participation survey results are set out in
Appendix V. The resettlement program has been made based on the opinions of the
people concemed, with details shown in the resettlement action plan (RAP). And the
summary of public participation by use of equiry form is shown in Table 5.

9. Resettlement
Sampled survey has been made of the opinions of the communities affected by
the project, including all the households going to be resettled, those directly affected,
individuals and persons in charge of collective unit. A total of 8144 enquiry formns
were issued and returned back totally. 93.1% of the people involved with resettlement
ask for compensation, 81.1% request to be locally resettled, 77.2% ask for shift or
change their job.
Based on the requests and the governument policy, resettlement and reconstruction
development plan include land acquisition, houshold resettlement, infi-astructure
facility relocation, employment etc., with details shown in RAP.
10. Summary
So long as the Environmental Action Plan (EAP) is implemented, the mitigation
or elimination of the various negative impacts can be achieved.
24



T-wo historical sites, Buddhist Monk Tomb and Zhuge City Ruin, have been
found so far along the project area assessed. The construction of road sections
involved with the two sites area will not start until excavation of the sites is completed,
or the road section alignment may be modified if it is necessary. During the
construction period. the laws concemed with the culture relics shall be observed.
therefore the impact on the culture relics shall be verv small.
The risk of the earth quake and the dangerous goods transport caused by the
project is very small, with little impact on the flood control along the project areas.
The locally arranged resettlement shall be carried out for the project, which not
results in great amount of people's relocation from the rural area to the urban area.
No impact on the wild life has been found for the project, which is good for the
development of the tourist resources along the project area.
Many years investigation and study on the eco-system of the middle and the lower
reaches of the Yangtze River show that the rapid reduction of the number of the rare
aquatic animals such as white-flag dolphin, Chinese sturgeon and Chinese paddlefish
in the Yangtze River is mainly due to unlawful fishing and the waterbome transport
development. The construction of the bridge shall neither do harm to the aquatic
animals nor change their living environment.
During the construction period of the bridge, the boring pile construction process
shall be adopted for under water pier construction, which can significantly reduce the
impact on the water quality caused by the substrate silt resuspension . The waste silt
generated by drilling shall be disposed at a designated site by barge, so that the water
pollution caused by the silt can be reduced to the minimum.
The environmental investment for the proposed road and the road bridge over the
Yangtze River shall account for 0.5%o of the total project investment (not including
such costs as land compensation and resettlement compensation, and those for the
underpasses. subgrade protection and drainage), the economic benefit of which shall
be greater than the environmental loss, with details seen in the EIA report. The impact
arising from the project shall be at an acceptable level; and due to the environmental
investment. the environment conditions shall be improved alone the existing national
road 107.
To actually materialize the environment protection measures, organizations
responsible for environment protection are going to be set up and shall be more
effective in their work with accumulated experience.
The environmental management plan, the environmental supervision plan. the
environmental monitor plan and the environmental action plan have been made.
