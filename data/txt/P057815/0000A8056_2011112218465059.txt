                         Implementation Status Overview
                         STSMP is a 10-year 2-phase APL aimed at modernizing the STS, improving voluntary compliance, efficiency, effectiveness,transparency, and fairness. Implementation was slow
                         between 2004 and mid-2006, but has picked up in the last few years. The closing date of the project has been extended to 29 June 2012 in order to ensure effective implementation
                         and completion of the Tax Block and the Document Management System, the two main outstanding activities. Most other project activities have been implemented satisfactorily. As

                         and the hardware for both. Implementation for these are ongoing and expected to be completed before the end date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The new Tax Code has ushered some useful changes with respect to the handling of large taxpayer which are being implemented by the STS. This has resulted in a 66% increase in

                         tax payment by large taxpayers. Revenues from large taxpayers have increased from 69% to72% of total revenues. The new provisions require mandatory registration of large
                         taxpayers in the large taxpayer offices (LTOs) whereas earlier this was optional. As a result, more than 2/3rd of large taxpayers (771 out of 1152) are now assessed in the LTOs
                         compared to only 1/3rd last year. The central LTO is established and charged with horizontal monitoring, drafting procedures and organizing trainings. All LTOs will be made directly
                         subordinate to the central office and not to the oblast offices as before according to STS plans.

                         Another significant improvement has been introduction of arrangements for Advance Pricing Agreements to control transfer pricing. A special unit is proposed to be created for this
                         specialized function. Large taxpayers have mandatory requirement to file declarations and source documents electronically.
