INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of India (GOI) for the equivalent
of US$57 million on standard IDA terms. The credit would support the
activities of the Rural Eletrification Corporation (REC) in making loans
to State Electricity Boards (SEBs) for the development of rural electri-
fication with emphasis on energizing minor irrigation wells. The proceeds of
the credit would be on-lent by the GOI to the REC on its normal terms for
such lending: for the Minimum Needs Program 1/ these loans are for 30 years,
including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 5-1/4% for the first 10
years, 5-3/4% for the second 10 years and 6-1/4% for the last 10 years; for
other loans, the terms are 20 years' maturity, including 5 years' grace,
and interest at 7-3/4%.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(691a-IN dated May 1, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1975. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and the difficulty of its economic conditions. While
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, the sheer
magnitude of the task facing the Government must be recognized. Governing
a country divided into more than 20 States with a population of some 600
million and over 60 languages is an extraordinary responsibility. The
country's poverty, supplemented by a net transfer of external resources
averaging in recent years only about US$1 per head per annum, have imposed
sharp limitations on the rate of growth. Account must be taken, also, of
the uncertainties imposed by the erratic availability of water. A bad monsoon,
which is inevitable from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the
entire economy and wipes out the results of years of efforts. Thus, the
annual growth of national income has averaged a modest 4% during the past
25 years, but only about 1% during the last four years (1971/72-1974/75),
which have included two consecutive monsoon failures - i.e., an actual
decline in per capita terms.
1/   The MinimumL beds Program is designed to provide the infrastructure
for development in the backward areas of India.

4.        Since independence progress has been impressive on many fronts,
but disappointing on others and has all too often fallen short of India's
massive needs. The growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport,
education, health services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been
achieved at high cost and has yi ided results of variable quality. Many
industrial and agricultural investment schemes have 'been highly successful,
but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and
structural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments
in many other parts of the world, but in other regions there has been
stagnation and possibly even decline. Despite these improvements and al-
though the distribution of income in India is relatively even by comparison
with most developing countries, there has been little impact upon the living
standards of the vast masses of the urban and rural population. The Govern-
ment has become increasingly concerned about the plight of the lower income
strata, which - conservatively measured - consist of some 200 million people
with incomes of less than US$60 per head per year, and has initiated in
recent years a variety of programs specifically designed to alleviate
poverty.
5.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.    Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 45% of national product in
the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years previously. The share
of output contributed by the industrial sector has increased only slowly and,
since the late 1960s, has remained approximately constant at a level of 23%.
There has, however, been a shift in the composition of industrial production,
with consumer, intermediate, and capital goods now contributing about one-
third each, compared with an overwhelming preponderance of consumer goods
product'on 25 years ago.
6.        Despite the slow pace of change and despite the undeniable magnitude
of the problems confronting her, India has the potential in a number of
important fields to mount a development effort which has a reasonable chance
of success in the longer run. In agriculture, as discussed in the economic
report of May 1975, the particular opportunities of substantial promise for
improving the food situation over the next decade are:
(a) Rejuvenation of the green revolution in wheat which
has taken place in recent years in the Northwest
and to a lesser extent in Bihar and West Bengal,
but which has been losing momentum since about 1970.
This is the result of deficiencies which can be corrected
-- most importantly seed deterioration and lagging irrigation
development.
(b) Better use of the vast potentials that have been and are
being created by surface irrigation through more expeditious
project completion and complementary land and on-farm improve-
ments to ensure better management and higher productivity of
water.



- 3 -
(c)    Acceleration of groundwater development, especially in the
Eastern regions, which are figuratively described as
"floating on water," where the untapped potential is large
and where consequently there are large opportunities for
multiple cropping, better water management and greater
crop security.
(d) Promotion of increased production of monsoon rice, based
on improved varieties which as yet have had only modest
success but which are expected, on the basis of current
research, to open the way to much greater productivity
over India's vast rain-fed rice producing areas during
the next few years.
(e) Pursuit of the promising, although somewhat less
definite, potential for greater productivity in dryland
cultivation and for extensive introduction of higher
yielding varieties of coarse grains.
Because of the difficulties to be encountered in the effective development
of these potentials, their realization is likely to follow uneven time
patterns, probably coming in bursts of expanded production as in the case
of the green revolution. And, along with administrative concentration and
effectiveness, they will all obviously require provision of the supplies
and services, especially fertilizer and power for irrigation, which are
essential complements of the necessary technical and environmental changes.
7.        Greater agricultural success would also make an important contribu-
tion to India's perenially difficult balance of payments situation, which is
frequently aggravated by the need for large food imports. From the balance
of payments viewpoint, another essential ingredient for a resumption of
modest growth is sustained export volume growth at considerably higher rates
than have been achieved historically. In view of the composition of Indian
exports, the momentum for such growth would have to be provided primarily
by the rapid expansion of industrial exports which, in addition to easing
the foreign exchange constraint, would act as an important stimulant to
industrial growth -- notably absent since the mid-sixties. In the field
of energy, too, there is considerable potential in the development of recent-
ly discoVered oil resources and in the continued expansion of coal production.
8.        It is hard, however, to conceive of the timely and effective
exploitation of these various potentials unless administrative capabilities,
which are overtaxed and diffused in an attempt to guide and control most
economic activities, are focused on these areas. The requirement for
industrial export stimulation would appear to be more generous and expeditious
incentives, sufficiently attractive and reliable to induce domestic producers
to venture into the competitive pressures of world markets. Finally
realization of India's potential will undoubtedly also require a considerable



-4-
infusion of external assistance, both to ease the payments constraints and
to supplement the limited doiestic resources availatle for development.
9.        W.hile there is thus potential for resuming the interrunted process
of growth, there remains the formidable obstacle of the clirrent difficulties
facing India. The short-term problem is much the same as it appeared last
year, with the important exception that the efforts made to adjust to changed
circumstances and the responsiveness of aid givers t:o India's needs should
mitigate the hardships that Lie ahead. Last year began with deficient winter
rains and a poor spring harvest, with one of the worst Government wheat
procurement experiences on record, with a prospective balance of payments
deficit of US$2.5 billion or twice as much as in the preceding year, with
inflation running at an anntul rate of 30% and a fiscal situation seemingly
out of hand, and with serious energy and material shortages and little
prospect for alleviating themD through imports within the severe constraints
of the balance of payments.  It was hardly surprising in this sitwation that
adjustment to immediate difficulties was the prime economic preoccupation.
Growth had necessarily to take a second place to short-run exigencies in
the emphasis of economic polLcy in this first year of the Fifth Five-Year
Plan period.
10.       Monetary expansion., which had been running at a rate of 15% in
1973/74, was brought under severe counterpressure through tight credit res-
trictions. The burden of these restrictions was borne largely by private
and Government commercial activities, without a significant reduction in the
rate of increase in net bank financing of the Government Budget. To this
curtailment of credit to the commercial sector, there was added the deflation-
ary influence arising from the net use of reserves aLnd as a result the rate
of monetary expansion in 1974/75 was reduced to about 6%, or less than half
that of the previous year.  This, in combination with some improvements in
physical supply, relieved the upward pressure on prices, and there was even
a small price reduction in the second half of the fiscal year. With con-
tinuing tight monetary policiLes, prospects are for greater price stability
this year than last.
11.       The food problem was probably the single most threatening element
on the economic scene last year. A poor harvest and low procurement in the
spring was only the start of agricultural adversities. Next was failure
of the mid-year monsoon in many key agricultural areas and a monsoon (kharif)
crop which fell below that oE 1973 by about 5 million tons. The resu'lt was
a severe shortage of domestic foodgrains for the public distribution system,
with availabilities only about half of an austere level of requirements. A
real food crisis was avoided, however, by imports of more than 6 million tons
of foodgrains during the year ending in Marc!- 1975; this was almost twice as
much as the imports of 1973/74. With tnese imports and with relative empha-
sis on food distribution in the cities rather than the countryside, where
supply conditions were presumed to be not quite so unmanageable, the threat-
ening food situation was weathered, although not without hunger and priva-
tion for a great many of the rural poor who were unable to afford much of
what food was available.



- 5 -
12.       The oil situation was managed, although at double the cost for a
reduced import level, by curbs on consumption and by substitution. MIotor
spirits were heavily taxed to reduce consumption by about 20%; factories
and power plants were converted from fuel oil to coal wherever possible
and supplies of fuel oil were reduced by more than 15%; coal production,
after years of stagnation, was increased by about 13%, and, after a poor
start, transport managed to keep up with the additional coal in spite of
serious labor troubles on the railways. There was also some improvement in
the operation of the deficient power system through special efforts to raise
the low capacity utilization of thermal plants and by a more systematic allo-
cation of available power, with special priority for requirements of agri-
cultural irrigation and fertilizer production. Power shortage has remained,
nevertheless, a severe constraint on the economies of many regions. Among
other critical shortages, the supply situation eased in the course of the
year, especially for fertilizer, steel and non-ferrous metals. The fertilizer
situation was brought into better balance by a combination of substantial
imports and some lag in demand attributable largely to poor weather and
sharply increased prices. Steel and other metal supplies also improved
during the year, with some increase in domestic production in the case of
steel and also because of price resistance and uncertainty in a sluggish
industrial situation.
13.       Last year's balance of payments turned out to be manageable in
spite of a 45% jump in the import bill. Economies in import volume helped.
More important, there was also an increase of 22% in the value of exports.
The main payments support, however, was an increase of about US$1 billion
in external financing, made up of large drawings on the International Mone-
tary Fund including the Fund's Oil Facility, larger aid from the India
Consortium including the World Bank Group, oil purchases on credit, a mil-
lion tons of wheat on loan from the USSR, and additional food aid from
several other countries. With all this, in 1974/75 India had to draw on its
gross reserves only by about US$40 million, but external debt service
requirements in the medium term were increased, as were obligations to the IMF.
14.       This year (1975/76) the economic situation has started more favor-
ably than last year, with the expectation of a better harvest and larger
procurement from the spring (rabi) crop, with easier conditions in other
material supplies, and with much less inflation. However, the payments
situation is if anything more critical.
15.       The 1975/76 trade deficit is projected at US$2,025 million.   This
compares with about US$1,815 million last year, but with hardly any trade
deficit at all in 1972/73, which was before India's terms of trade worsened
sharply as prices of imported oil, grain, fertilizer and other essential
goods went up. Adding to the 1975/76 trade deficit another US$800 million
of payments on external obligations and taking account also of probable net
invisible receipts, this year's overall balance of payments deficit seems
likely to come to about US$2,635 million, or about US$160 million more than
last year. These enormous deficits persist in any reasonable calculation of



- 6 -
minimum import requirements of fuel, food, fertilizer and other essentials,
for which further compression seems hardly feasible, even at the low level
at which the economy is functioning.
16.       Fortunately nearly half of this year's prospective deficit (about
US$1,155 million) can be covered fom gross disbursements of previously
committed foreign aid, including juist over a billion dollars of Consortium
aid about evenly divided between bilateral and World Bank Group sources.
Eastern Europe is expected to provide perhaps US$100 million, which is down
considerably from last year in the absence of further food assistance from
the USSR. All this leaves a balance of US$1,500 million to be financed from
disbursements out of new aid commitments in the current year and to some
extent by an inevitable drawdown of foreign exchange reserves which stood at
US$1,365 million at March 31, 1975.
17.       To highlight the crucial variables in India's longer-term payments
outlook, the May 1975 economic report contains some projections of India's
import capability during the 10 years following 1975/76. Broadly speaking,
the conclusion which emerges is that a modest increase in India's import
capability - an average of 5.2% per annum after allow:ing for inflation -
could be achieved, provided: (i) new aid commitments in real terms (including
IMF facilities and the aid provided by oil producers) remain approximately at
1974/75 levels; (ii) India's exports attain an averag,e volume growth of about
8% between 1976/77 and 1985/86; and (iii) the bulk of new aid continues to
be provided on concessional terms. Given the above assumptions the debt
service ratio (expressed as a percentage of export earnings) would rise from
about 19% in 1974/75 to 23% in 1979/80 and then decline slowly. India's
external public debt outstanding and disbursed on March 31, 1974 stood at
US$12.4 billion,
18.       A considerably improved export performance, which will require
policy measures to improve incentives, is crucial to a successful development
effort. To the degree that exports fall short of the 8% growth target,
India's creditworthiness will be reduced, and she will face greater dif-
ficulty in borrowing to meet a larger balance of payments deficit; the re-
sult would be slower growth throughout the economy.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank. Group has made 44 loans and 72 development
credits to India totalling US$1,437 million and US$3,404 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$691 million has been
repaid, and US$1,548 million was still undisbursed as of May 31, 1975.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of May 31, 1975,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



20.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totalling US$51.8
million, of which US$8.4 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$29.5 million, US$22.4 mil-
lion represents loans and US$7.1 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of May 31, 1975 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are
other agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank
Group has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer
sector and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institu-
tions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale
industrial enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and com-
ponents for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating
better capacity utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active
in supporting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and
railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and related
urban investments have also received Bank Group support in recent years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
by the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit for on-farm investments, command area development of existing irriga-
tion schemes, and seed production form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next years. Special emphasis will be given to projects bene-
fitting small farmers and landless laborers. Lending in support of infra-
structure and industrial investments will focus on energy-related projects.
Repeater credits for power and railways have high priority in this context,
and discussions are under way with the Government in an effort to identify
and prepare projects specifically designed to facilitate coal production
and coal transport. Lending for fertilizer projects, which has been an im-
portant feature in recent years, is expected to continue to occupy a prom-
inent place in the future program; the use of coal-based technology will
receive particular attention.
23.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources
in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic
reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. The need for
readily usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time
when output and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different
price situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial
raw materials and components continues to be an essential element within the
overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of



- 8 -
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning.   For the Bank Group to be able to make
-n appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors,
it is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion contri-
buted by the Bank Group has grown significantly.    In 1969/70 the Bank Group
accounted for 34% of total conmitments, 13% of gross disbursements, and 12%
of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 35%, 28% and 42%, respec-
tively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group is expected to
continue growing.   Whereas on M.Sarch 31, 1974, the Bank Group's share of
India's outstanding external public debt was 19%, by 1979 it is likely to
account for about 25%. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predomi-
nantly in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise
slowly. In 1974/75 about 14% of India's total debt service payments were
to the Bank Group.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
25,       India's installed power generating capacity increased at an
average annual rate of 10.3% over the 20-year period from the end of 1950,
while gross electricity generation grew at 11.6%. Demand, however, was
consistently greater than the available supply, with the result that India's
power sector has been characterized by local and intermittent shortages.
This situation has been due to a number of factors, including inadequate
planning, delays in the construction of new generation projects, the late-
ness or inadequacy of additions to transmission and distribution facilities,
and operating and maintenance problems. During the :Last three years of the
Fourth Five-Year Plan, ending in March 1974, the power supply situation be-
came critical, since the above problems were exacerbated by the failure of
two successive monsoons, leading to the enforced shut-down of hydro plants,
and by shortage of coal for the power sector, which had an adverse impact
on thermal generation.
26.       Thus, events fell far short of the ambitious targets for the
Fourth Plan. Installed generating capacity reached 18.4 million KW by the
end of 1973/74, compared to a target of 23 million KW. Since then, power
supply has increased considerably, due to better utilization of existing
thermal plant, the commissioning of new capacity, and additional intercon-
nection of transmission facilities. Preliminary figujres for the year ended
in March 1975 indicate a 9.3% increase in installed capacity and a 3.5% in-
crease in electricity generation compared with the previous year.
27.       The Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan aims at a generating capacity of
35.4 million KW at the end of 1978/79, almost double the capacity attained
by the end of the Fourth Plan. This implies an even larger increase in
electricity consumption, because it is also planned to reduce relative



- 9 -
transmission and distribution losses. It would be reasonable to expect
some shortfall from these ambitious targets; the size of the shortfall
will depend upon the implementation capabilities of the State Electricity
Boards (SEBs), the availability of financing, and the capacity of the con-
struction industry to complete projects on time. Although the power supply
situation will remain tight at least during the first half of the Fifth
Plan period, it should improve thereafter in most parts of the country.
28.       Of the total proposed Fifth Plan outlay of Rs 62 billion in the
power sector, Rs 11 billion, or 18%, is allocated to rural electrification.
Since 1967 rural electrification has been an important element in the
Government's strategy to increase food production, by helping to maximize
the use of groundwater through the electrification of pump sets. It is
also a key element in integrated rural development and therefore a powerful
tool for the economic and social advancement of the rural population.
Achievements to date have been impressive: by March 1974, over two million
pumpsets had been electrified, compared with some 500,000 a decade earlier,
and over one-quarter of the 570,000 villages in India had been electrified.
The Draft Fifth Plan calls for the electrification of another 1.5 million
irrigation pumps and 100,000 villages.
29.       Financial returns to SEBs on rural eLectrification investments
are very low. This is chiefly because of (i) relatively low population
density in rural areas, (ii) high cost of supply resulting from poor load
factors and long distribution lines, and (iii) tariffs which do not cover
the cost of supply. Even so, given its impact on increased agricultural
production and on income generation in the poorest areas, rural electrifica-
tion in India is clearly justified on economic and social grounds.
30.       The Indian power sector is institutionally complex because
electricity supply is within the concurrent juridisction of the Central
Government and the State Governments, according to the Constitution and
to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. The Act assigned to SEBs responsibi-
lity for the development of power generation, transmission and distribution
within each State, leaving the Center with a vaguely defined responsibility
for planning and coordination. This was workable when power consumption
was very low and confined to a few urban centers, but the need for improved
planning of integrated power development has become increasingly obvious
in recent years.
31.       It will take time to bring about effective change in the operation
of the power sector, because the States are understandably reluctant to
relinquish some of their authority to the Center. Nevertheless, a beginning
has now been made with the necessary institutional reforms. The Act of
1948 provided for a Central Electricity Authority (CEA) which was to be
responsible for developing a national power development policy and for
coordinating the activities of the various agencies at the Central level
influencing resource allocations and development priorities for the power
sector. Although it was formally created in 1950, the CEA has been
ineffective. However, it is now in the process of being reorganized. The
former Central Water and Power Commission has been split; the irrigation



- 10 -
function is now carried out within the Ministry of Agriculture, and the
power function has been undertaken by the CEA, which reports to the Ministry
of Energy. Four members have been appointed; the Chairman and two other
members remain to be appointed. The Institute of Management at Ahmedabad
has been appointed to help formul;zte the structure of the new organization,
particularly at the subordinate btaff levels. Although the new organiza-
tion is not yet complete, and is, therefore, not fuilly operational, progress
to date demonstrates genuine movement toward more effective regional and
national integration of the power sector.
32.       Apart from these institutional reforms, greater authority is
also expected to accrue to the Center under plans to give a major place in
future electric power development to large projects under central juris-
diction, with the power generated to be sold to the States. This should
go a long way toward offsettirng State deficiencies and providing a source
of generation for inter-State switching according to regional and national
requirements.
33.       The Bank Group has been providing assistance for power development
in India sirnce 1950, and has made eight loans and six credits totalling
US$437 million for the sector. Prior to 1965, this assistance was focused
on the financing of generatiorn projects; subsequently the focus has been on
the strengthening of high-voltage transmission facilities.   The two projects
now under implementation, the Second and Third Power Transmission projects
(Credit 242-IN of 1971 and Credit 377-In of 1973), got off to a slow start as
a result of delays in the development of satisfactory bidding documents and
delays in the evaluation of bids; as a result, only some US$24.9 million had
been disbursed as of May 31, 1975O However, virtually all orders have now
been placed, and implementation is expected to proceed as rapidly as the
timing of deliveries permits; US$4.2 million were disbursed during April 1975
alone.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       Appraisal of the proposed project was completed in April 1973.
Processing was delayed because of the severe power shortages then prevail-
ng ir. India and because organizational measures required by the Association
-reactivation of the CEA -- took longer then expected.  An updating
mission visited India in February 1975.   A report entitled "Appraisal
of Rural Electrification Project" (No. 688-IN, dated June 23, 1975), is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held
in Washington in May, 1975. The Government of India was represented by
Mr. V.N. Rajagopalan of the Ministry of Finance and Mr. R. Kapur of the
Ministry of Energy; the Rural Electrification Corporation by Mr. M.M.K. Wali,
Managing Director, and Mr. B.S. Kochar, Chief Engineer. Attached as Annex III
is a credit and project summary.



Project Description
35.       The project consists of rural electrification schemes to be under-
taken by the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) during the Fifth Five-
Year Plan period, ending in March 1979. REC's program over the Fifth Five-
Year Plan period (1974/75 to 1978/79) is projected at about US$800 million.
Rural electrification schemes which are submitted by eligible SEBs (see
para 39 below) and which meet REC's criteria (see para 38 below) will be
eligible for financing under the credit. About 140 schemes covering a total
of US$114 million are expected to receive assistance under the credit.
More than half of the connected load would be for irrigation pumping; the
balance would be for small industries and domestic and commercial connections.
The REC, an autonomous company under the general supervision of the Ministry
of Energy, was established in 1969 to channel funds to SEBs for rural
electrification development. Of its original capital of Rs 1,500 million,
70% was provided by a grant from the United States and the balance from the
Government. All these funds and more have now been used by REC for some
958 rural electrification schemes sanctioned as of March 31, 1975, and the
Corporation needs additional funds to carry on its business.
Implementing Agency
36.       REC management is vested in a Board of Directors consisting of
a part-time Chairman, who has wide banking and financial experience, full-
time Managing and Technical Directors, and nine part-time Directors.
The REC is a strong organization supported by competent professional and
techni-al staff. It has established sound policies and procedures for
project appraisal, evaluation and approval; it monitors the implementation
of sanctioned schemes; it coordinates the standardization of equipment
and construction practices. Rural electrification is an integral part
of rural development and the appraisal of rural development schemes takes
into account all relevant infrastructure considerations and the availability
of inputs (e.g. groundwater, credit facilities, fertilizers and seeds).
Thus REC is not merely a lending institution but is involved in the whole
process of rural development.
37.       REC's financial position is satisfactory.   Its equity as of
March 31,.1974, was almost four times its long-term debt, but this ratio
will not be maintained in the future, since the Government intends to
increase the proportions of its capital contribution made in the form of
debt. Due to the large interest-free grant from the U.S. and the low-cost
capital made available by the GOI, the overall cost of capital to the REC
has been about 1% in the past and the interest earned on loans advanced by
it has averaged 5.5%. Although the amount of interest REC pays on borrowed
money is projected to increase rapidly, it will recover this through
interest on loans advanced to SEBs, expected to average 6.6%. Projections
show that from 1974 to 1979, revenue would increase six-fold and operating
income   (after interest and administration cost) by 24%.   To ensure that
REC continues to have sufficient funds to meet its debt service obligations
and other expenses, the GOI and REC have agreed that REC's internally



- 12 -
generated funds shall be not less than 1.2 times its debt service require-
ments in any financial year and that REC's administrative and interest
expenses shall not exceed 90% of the interest it receives during any finan-
cial year (Section 4.02 of Development Credit Agreement and Section 4.03
of Project Agreement).
38.       The Corporation has established acceptable criteria for lending to
SEBs to finance rural electrification schemes. These call for revenues and
expenses breaking even by the seventh to the fifteenth year of operations,
depending upon the type of scheme involved, and are equivalent to internal
financial rates of return ranging from about 10% to 5%. The REC has agreed
to utilize the proceeds of the proposed credit only for schemes which promise
to meet these financial viability criteria (Section 2.05 of Project Agree-
ment).
39.       Since SEBs were first established, their finances have not been
satisfactory, due in part to weaknesses in the Electricity (Supply) Act,
1948, and in part to the fact that their initial capitalization was pri-
marily through debt to the State Governments, leading to large arrears of
interest. In 1964, a Government committee set up to examine the financial
workings of SEBs made various proposals for improving their financial
condition. While most SEBs have since increased their earnings, attain-
ment of the established rate-of-return target is still not within reach for
most of them. This is largely attributable to their low-yielding investment
in rural electrification, which has not been adequately compensated by tariff
increases. Credit 377-IN established that the six State Governments which
are participating in that Credit (Assam, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,
Orissa, and Tamil Nadu) would subsidize losses incurred by the SEBs from
rural electrification operations. To contribute to the broad objective of
encouraging SEBs to become financially viable, the REC has agreed to utilize
the proceeds of the proposed credit only for loans to those SEBs, as deter-
mined by the Association, whose State Governments agree to provide them with
an annual subsidy to the extent needed to enable them to meet the rate-of-
return target or to fully subsidize their losses on rural electrification
operations (Section 2.04 of Project Agreement).
The Financing of a Rural Electrification Schemes
40.       The REC makes initial advances of about 352 of the value of loans
at the time they are sanctioned. For subsequent years' disbursements on
these loans, the Corporation relies on capital contributions from the
Government. The GOI has agreed to provide the REC each year not only with
funds to enable it to make initial advances and subsequent disbursements
under the project, but also with sufficient fvnc's to close any financial gap
between that year's disbursements on loans existing aLt the beginning of the
year and funds available from other sources (Section 4.01 of Development
Credit Agreement). REC's loans normally include a provision of 3% of the
project costs for physical contingencies, but no provision for price esca-
lation. In view of recent inflation rates and the fact that disbursements
against sanctioned projects normally extend over 5-7 years, REC has agreed
to make provision for price escalation during the construction period of



- 13 -
schemes sanctioned in the future, as the SEB may be unable to secure addi-
tional funds elsewhere. (Section 3.03 of Project Agreement).
41.       The Terms of RECts loans to SEBs for rural electrification schemes
have been tailored to meet the circumstances of particular categories of
schemes. However, in general, interest rates are graduated over the life of
a loan starting at a minimum of 5-3/4% and rising to a maximum of 9%.
Maturities range from 8-30 years with corresponding grace periods ranging
from 1 year to 5 years.
Project Costs and Financing
42.       The total project cost of US$114 million will be met by equity pro-
vided to REC by GOI (US$24 million), loans from GOI and market borrowings
(US$33 million) and the proposed credit of US$57 million. The foreign ex-
change cost of the project is US$29.7 million. The principal items required
for the project are conductors (US$28.6 million), transformers and circuit
breakers (US$11.4 million), poles (US$17.1 million) capacitors, insulators
and meters (US$8.5 million) miscellaneous equipment and service connections
(US$20 million) and supervision, overhead and physical contingencies (US$17.1
million). The proceeds of the credit would finance 100% of the items procured
through international competitive bidding and 50% of the cost of poles which
will be procured locally. Up to US$27 million of the credit may be used to
meet local expenditures (see para. 43 below).
'Proeurement and Disbursement
43.       Conductors, (US$28.6 million), transformers and circuit-breakers
(US$11.4 million), and capacitors, insulators and meters (US$8.5 million),
would be procured through international competitive bidding. Poles, valued
at about US$17.1 million, are too heavy and their resulting transportation
cost too high to be suitable for international bidding and would be procured
locally. Each SEB would be responsible for its uwn procurement, but REC
would provide assistance in bid documentation and evaluation. The items
to be procured internationally would be grouped for purposes of invitations
to bid in packages of contracts estimated to cost at least US$1 million;
any SEB which does not engage in this volume of procurement for REC-financed
schemes in a year would group its total estimated annual requirements for
these items in a single bid invitation. Indian suppliers competing under
international competitive bidding would be granted a preference margin of
15% or the current rate of import duty, whichever is less. It is estimated
that about 80% of the conductor contracts, 70% of the transformer contracts
and 70% of the other internationally bid contracts - which have an esti-
mated indirect foreign exchange content of 60%, 40% and 20% of ex-factory
costs, respectively - would be won by Indian bidders. In that case, the
credit would involve local currency financing of about US$27 million. The
credit would be disbursed against 100% of the c.i.f. or ex-factory cost of
internationally bid contracts and 50% of the ex-factory costs of locally bid
contracts.

Justification
44.       The project would benefit about 55,000 farmers and their dependents
and about 210,000 domestic/commercial consumers in 6,250 villages. The main
economic benefits would result from increased agricultural production.
Irrigation pumpsets, for which electrical power is generally more economical
than diesel power, would enable farmers to intensify land use and to raise
output through the use of high yielding seed varieties. Other benefits would
accrue from the expected establishment of small industries, especially
agro-industries, and thereby the creation of new employment opportunities.
There would also be social benefits such as the many uses of electricity
in rural villages and households and the possible curbs on urban migration.
Based on the value of incremental output from agriculture and small industry
and the expected revenues from domestic and commercial consumers, the eco-
nomic rate of return on investment in a typical REC-financed project is
estimated at 23%. While this is the return from a typical REC scheme, there
will be substantial variations depending upon the conditions prevailing in
different states but it is not expected that schemes that meet REC's criteria
will show an economic rate of return of less than 10%. These estimates do
not take account of the unquantifiable socio-economic benefits of village
electrification just mentioned.
PART V - INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and the
Rural Electrification Corporation, the Recommendation of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the
text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed development credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
46.       Features of the draft agreements of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 37, 38, 39 and 40 of this report.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are below.
The level of disbursements was $368 million in FY74 or 83% of Bank Group
commitments to India in that year. The undisbursed pipeline of $1,5L8 million as
of Mlay- 1 , 1975, corresponds rosghly to comrrTLitrnents over the preceding 2L-month
period and reflects the lead time which would be expected given the mix of
fast and slow disbursing projects in the India program.
Ln. No. 789    Ninth Industrial lCredit and Investment Corporation of India
Projectl US 0    million loan of October 21 , 1971; Closing
Date: December 31,9
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Pro;ect  US 0.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1097   Eleventh Industrial Credit and Investment; Cor oration of India
Project; US$100 million loan of Ap ril 2, 197g, Closing Date:
December 31 , 1980
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a well-
established development finance company. Loan 789-IN is fully committed; and
disbursements under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule. Conditions of effectiveness
for Loan 1097 will have to be fulfilled by July 3, 1975.
Ln. No. 614    Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high-yielding varieties. The Corporation is working
efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality. Seed
production is meeting targets. Implementation problems over processing plant
construction and land-leveling have been resolved although, as a result of these
delays, an extension of the closing date by two years has been necessary.
Expansion of an existing processing plant has been completed and expansion of
another existing plant is in progress. Orders are about to be placed for con-
struction and equipment of a new plant and for a controlled-environmert store.
Cr.-No. 176    Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30,_1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam on
the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The
project also includes field channel construction, land-leveling, drainage works

and roads, and a program to support agricultural development.  The project will
be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays in dam construction.
The agricultural components of the project are also behind schedule. Some of the
delays in implementation have occurred at the start of the project before major
investments have been made. These will not affect the economic justification of
the project. Further delays have occurred as a result of building materials short-
ages. The Government has recently intervened and made adequate quantities of
building materials available. In spite of an additional delay in the procurement
of a large batching plant, the dam is still expected to be completed in July 1977
which is in accordance with the revised schedule.
Cr. No.  268   Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closin& Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development on
the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to some
100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-lined main
canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads. Until mid-1973,
overall performance on the project was satisfactory with construction and dis-
bursements from the IDA credit progressing ahead of schedule. Acute shortages of
construction materials, especially explosives for the canal excavation, have
hampered progress. As a result, construction of the main canals has fallen about
one year behind schedule. This is likely to delay the introduction of irrigation
to over 40% of the project area. Land development is presently haphazard and
increasingly lagging behind water availability in the project. Government is
aware of the inadequacy of the credit operation for land development and has
requested IDA financing for a Command Area Development Project, to be implemented
by a Central Authority for all farmers in need of land development. Construction
of the dam, which was also affected by temporary shortages of building materials,
in now progressing satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 540    Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC) Project; Us$75.0 million
credit of April        5te: December 31, 1977
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment only, all the above agricultural credit projects are similar
in structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-term credit to
farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments as imported
tractors, minor irrigation and lamd-leveling. Disbursement of these credits
started slowly. So far as the minor irrigation components were concerned, the
main difficulties stemmed from the institutional requirements, in particular the
introductlon of changes in lending criteria and lending terms and the strengthening
of institutions responsible for assessing groundwater availability. These constraints
have been overcome and disbursements are on schedule. Tractor procurement was delayed
following changes in both the supply and demand situations after the projects were
originally appraised,which prompted GOI to request that indigenous as well as
imported models should be eligible for IDA financing under these credits. The
Executive Directors approved this request in December 1973 and those credits which
have tractor components have been amended accordingly. Tractor procurement is now
in progress. Some funds earmarked for land leveling and tractors have been reallo-
cated to minor irrigation components. Credit 540 is a continuation nationwide of
the previous program of agricultulral credit projects, which were confined to
individual States. ARC will continue to act as the financial intermediary for
refinancing agricultural credit. Conditions of effectiveness for this Credit will
have to be fulfilled by July 28, 1975.
Cr. No.  267   Wheat Storage; US.$50 million credit of Augst 23, 191 Closing
Date: Sep2tember 3°. 127.?
This credit, which provides storage facilities in India's wheat belt,
comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons capacity) and 10 silos
(200,000 tons capacity) and an aLl-India grain storage study.   Nine of the ten
warehouses have been constructed and disbursements for this project component
have been completed. The Government Food Ministry has selected a local research
institute to conduct the study. Administrative problems, substantial cost increases,
and technical difficulties in the selection of silo sites have hampered the execution
of the silo component. The last supervision mission has assessed the situation and
has recommended a restructuring of the silo component to enable it to be completed
within the financing plan. Tendering for silo foundations has been initiated.

This project was designed to promote the development of apple proc-
essing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh and comprises roads, cold storage,
juice processing, and marketing facilities. The project entity, the H.P.
Horticultural Produce Processing and Marketing Corporation (HPMC) has been
established and key senior staff recruited, including the Managing Director.
A project review -m.ssion has just retur!ied in mid-Juno and its report ½s bein-g

Cr. No. 403    Telecommunications V; US$80.0 million credit of June 25, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Disbursements have been delayed mainly because of delays in material
supply from both local and external sources. Delays in local supply were due to
labor problems affecting one of the principal suppliers and imports were delayed
due to longer than anticipated lead time required. The closing date of Telecomm-
unications IV was therefore postponed by six months. Revised disbursement schedules
for these two credits are now expected to be met.
Cr.-No.    242  Power Transmission II; US$75.O million credit of Hay 3, 1971;

Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission II Project; US$85.0 million credit of May 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 19Z7
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project financed
by Loan 416-IN, was designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment
and materials required to develop a power transmission program in nine states
under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems
associated with preparing bid documents suitable for international bidding and
the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but all contract awards
have now been made. As a consequence of the delays,however, the closing date of
the credit had to be postponed accordingly. For Power Transmission III, specifi-
cation and tendering procedures are progressing. Tenders received so far indicate
substantial cost overruns.

In. No. 1079   IFFCO Fertilizer ProJect; US$109 million loan of January 24, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the expansion
of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project is now proceeding
about 24 months behind schedule mainly because of procurement delays, slow progress
on civil works, and shortages of steel and cement. Procurement problems have been
largely overcome, and most of the equipment is either at the site or at the Cochin
port. Another factor which has contributed to the delay has been technical problems
in the commissioning of the Cochin I plant, which has required a disproportionate
amount of management attention. Credit No. 481 contains funds for a Plant Operations
Improvement Program which will be used in part to overcome these problems; the use
of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant basis and procurement has
been initiated. The engineering design for the Gorakhpur project is well advanced
and virtually all the equipment has been ordered. Although delivery of some equip-
ment is taking longer than forecast during appraisal, the project is progressing
without serious difficulties.  Engineering work, procurement and site construction
for the Nangal Fertilizer Project are proceeding satisfactorily. Progress on the
Trombay IV project has been good although project completion may be delayed by about
four months because of longer than expected delivery times for critical equipment.
The Sindri Credit became effective on February 27, 1975. Engineering design and
procurement preparations are proceeding on schedule. The IFFCO loan was signed on
January 24, 1975 and became effective on April 28, 1975.
Cr. No. 448    RailwasXTII; US$80 million credit of December 21, 1974; Closing
Date: September 30, 1975
This project consists of new and ongoing works in the Indian Railways
investment program. Disbursements are on schedule.
Cr. No. 294    Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,

Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Market Project; US$8.0 million
credit of May 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with establishment of wholesale
markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under the projects
has generally been satisfactory. Markets construction in Bihar was delayed due
to legal challenges arising out of the state's acquisition of land for market
sites; however, these difficulties have been satisfactorily resolved. Market
construction in Karnataka is expected to be on schedule.

staff have been appointed.
Cr. No.  342   Agricultural Universities; US$12.0 million credit of November 10,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Project implementation has improved with satisfactory progress on civil
works, preparation of equipment lists, bid documents, fellowship programs and
university development plans. The rate of disbursement has been slow, partly due
to previous delays in the selection of key personnel and in the preparation of
equipment lists, but is expected to improve by FY1976 in line with progressing
construction and equipment procurement.
Cr. No.  356   Industrial Development Bank of India; US$25.0 million credit of
February 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project had a particularly slow start which was mainly due to
institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations. The
last review mission reported in May 1974 that satisfactory progress could be
expected soon. As of May 20, 1975, commitments for sub-projects reached $7.0
million and disbursements have begun. Another review mission is currently in
the field and will try to find ways to improve the rate of credit fund utilization.
Cr. No. 390 Bombay Water SUPP1Y and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million credit
of January 22, 1974; Closing Date:  December 31, 1978
Project implementation is about 24 months behind schedule because of
delays in appointing consultants and the need to redesign certain project elements.
Disbursements have been delayed for the same reason, but several large contracts
are now being let, and the disbursement rate should then improve.

February 14, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This credit was signed on February 14, 1975 for the initial tranche
of US$100 million and amended to US$200 million on March 7, 1975. The credit
became effective on March 31, 1975.
Cr. No.  427   Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit of
September 12, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This credit became effective on January 10, 1974, except for a
US$2.6 million portion allocated to a slum redevelopment proposal and a site
and services scheme. This portion became effective on July 15, 1974. As of
May 31, 1975, US4L).4 million had been disbursed under the credit, mainl.y for

management staff appointed.   Some progress has been made in planning and training
of specialized teams and in preparing a banking plan, but the project is about 4
months behind schedule at this early stage largely due to insufficient staffing
of the KDDC, which is responsible for project implementation. Conditions of
