PROVINCIAL UNIVERSITIES PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:              People's Republic of China
Amount:                SDR 108 milLion (US$120 million equivalent)
Terms:                 Standard
Project Description:  The project objective is to assist provincial universi-
ties and the State Education Commission (SEdC) to expand
enrollment as well as improve the quality and management
of higher education programs. The project will have two
components: (a) Assistance to Provincial Universities;
and (b) Assistance to Higher Education Development. The
first component will assist 60 universities by providing
for civil works, equipment for teaching and research,
curricula reorganization and staff development oppor-
tunities such as fellowships, study tours and specialist
services. Emphasis will be given to teacher education
programs. The second component will assist SEdC and
PHEBs to strengthen their planning and management
capacities mainly through provision of technical
assistance. Two planning activities to be executed by
SEdC with the assistance of the provinces will be
supported. The higher education masterplan will:
assess the requirements of industry, agriculture,
commerce and government; set enrollment targets; and
locate areas where new institutions are needed to meet
requirements for educated manpower. Teacher demand and
supply plans will examine enrollment at each level of
education, assess size and quality of the existing
teacher stock and set targets accordingly for pre- and
in-service teacher training. As in previous education
projects, an International Advisory Panel (IAP) has been
established for the purpose of the project, and will be
maintained to advise the Government on project
implementation.
The principal risk of the project would lie in the
variation of implementation ability among the 28 pro-
vinces. This risk is reduced by: (a) excellent perfor-
mance in SEdC's project implementation in previous
projects; (b) active involvement of the SEdC Planning
Bureau in the two planning activities; (c) strong
commitment shown during appraisal by the provinces to
meet criteria for inclusion in the project; and (d) the
contribution of the IAP.

I.  OVERVIEW OF EDUCATION IX CHINA
Education Overview
1.01     During the remainder of this century China's educational system will
adjust in severaL ways: (a) declining population and therefore enrollment in
the primary and lover secondary levels; (b) changing patterns of grades which
vill add grade 6 to all primary schools and extend the secondary level to
include grade 12; (c) higher enrollment ratios at the secondary and tertiary
levels; (d) increased numbers of pupils per teacher at the secondary and
tertiary levels; and (e) more vocational emphasis at secondary and post-
secondary levels.

/a   Academic and technical/vocational streams.
1.02      Primary enrollment will be sharply affected by the remarkable 30Z
reduction in the age group population caused by the success of the nation's
family planning program. Offsetting this decline will be the Government's
drive to attain full enrollment of children in remote and poorer regions and
to extend primary education, which is at present offered to less than 20% of
the primary school age group, to six grades. Although the official enrollment
ratio for primary education is above 90%, the average attendance rate is
estimated to be only 60Z and the percentage completing the entire primary



-2-
cycle (five or 17ix years) may be as low as 302. Girls are more likely to drop
out than boys.-
1.03      Lower secondary schools offering grades 7-9 will move toward
universal access as the enrollment ratio is raised from the current 48%.
Cities and economically developed areas mainly in coastal provinces are expec-
ted to achieve universal access by about 1990 wbile towns and villages with
medium level development will aim for this goal by about 1995. A more flex-
ible timetable and assistance from the central government are required for the
economically backward areas to attain universal access to lower secondary
education.
1.04      At the upper secondary level major changes are foreseen.  The
government target is simultaneously to increase the enrollment ratio and pro-
vide the opportunity for vocational education for students who are not
college-bound. The vocational stream would have different emphases: agricul-
turaL in rural areas, industrial and services in major cities depending on
economic conditions and manpower requirements. The proposed increase in voca-
tional education at the upper secondary level will require creation of schools
and centers for both long-term and short-term training and investment in
training of vocational teachers.
1.05      Special problems in the primary and secondary school systems are:
(a) the prevalence of large numbers of small schools; and (b) a high propor-
tion of unqualified teachers. In 1983 average school size was 158 for primary
and 445 for secondary, both far below optimum levels (about 400 for primary
and 1,000 for secondary). ALout 15% of all primary enrollment (i.e., about
20 million children) attend schools which are not large enough to have one
class per grade. As many as a quarter of these small schools are unnecessa-
rily small and the problem could be solved by consolidation. Many other small
primary schools are the result of low population density in certain rural
areas and/or the habitation in school catchment areas by two or more ethnic
groups for which Government policy requires separate schools.
1.06      A second and more pervasive problem is the proportion of teachers at
all three levels of primary and secondary education who are unqualified. At
the primary and upper secondary levels only about half of the teachers may be
considered qualified, and at the lower secondary level this proportion falls
to 40% (Table 1.2). In numerical terms about 3 million teachers under the age
of 50 require upgrading. The target for completion of this upgrading program
is 1990, but so far the pace has not been sufficient to meet this target.

Higher Education Overview
1.07      Chinese higher education consists of three levels:
(a) Postsecondary - All non-degree programs of less than four years
duration. The newly formed and rapidly growing polytechnic system
is a prime example.
(b) Higher Education - Four year or bachelor's degree programs.
(c) Graduate Education - Master's and doctoral degree programs.
1.08      Another classification system for higher education which is widely
used by the State Education Commission (SEdC) looks at authorities which con-
trol the institutions (Table 1.3) and the general type of curricula offered.
A continuing problem is the large proportion of the instituti?ns which are
limited to one field of study. The system of "conventional"- institutions at
present totals 902, of which 301 are controlled by national authorities. The
remaining 601 institutions are controlled by provincial, and municipal autho-
rities and are referred to as provincial institutions (Annex 2). The emerging
system of 28 provincial television universities are not included in this total
because they use less conventional delivery means.
2/   "Conventional" refers to the delivery mode of the institution.
Conventional instruction generally involves structured teaching to a
group of students in a classroom setting and tends to be full-time.
Television university, correspondence schools and worker and spare time
universities are considered non-conventional institutions.

1.09      Curriculum.  Courses of study are relatively uniform across all
universities since SEdC controls content of curricula regardless of the level
of government or agency responsible for management of the institution. This
may change as the system embarks on a decentrali tion policy.  Higher educa-
tion curricula are generally divided into three -  types of courses:  politi-
cal, general and subject majors (Annex 3). The political education portion,
nearly identical in all institutions, consumes 6-12X of student contact hours
in most fields. Similarly, students are required to take courses in foreign
language and physical education which are also taught under a national curri-
culum and occupy another 10-18% of student contact hours. Subject majors,
which comprise roughly 70-80X of student contact hours, also have a large
degree of commonality. Only in the upper division of a bachelor's degree pro-
gram is a diversified curriculum offered, and even this diversity is somewhat
limited. Electives, about 10% of total hours, are confined to the major sub-
ject field only. Special needs of technical ministries and bureaux such as
agriculture, health, railways, petroleum, coal, machine industry, et al.,
which have higher education institutions under their control, result in some
diverse curricula in the upper division and at the graduate level in these
institutions. But such courses comprise less than 20% of total contact hours
in a bachelor's degree program.
2/   In normal universities and colleges a fourth type of course in pedagogy
and psychology comprising 5-8% of contact hours is added by slightly
reducing the percentages in the other three segments.



1.10      Admissions Procedures.  For admission to higher education institu-
tions, all students are required to take a very challenging national univer-
sity entrance examination. This examination suffers from several technical
weaknesses: its items are not tested before use, it is hand-scored and the
essay-type-answers are graded by untrained and in many cases unqualified
readers. However, it exists as the only availabLe tool for admission and is
surprisingly well managed given the lack of computer assistance. Each year 7-
8 million young persons are tested at the end of their senior year of high
school and within two months 300,000-500,000 are offered a university place.
The examination is challenging and the 4-6X who are admitted under it have
succeeded in running one of the world's most demanding education gauntlets.
Nationally controlled institutions draw new students nationally, but provin-
cial, mnicipal and county institutions draw only from their areas of juris-
diction. In between are some regional arrangements where a nationally
controlled institution is allotted prime responsibility for several pro-
vinces. As would be expected, new admittees in the most distinguished
universities have the highest examination scores. Although it is the Govern-
ment' s long standing policy to assign jobs to national university graduates on
a national basis, many graduating students prefer to obtain employment in
their home provinces. Increasingly, applicants seek to avoid distant assign-
men.ts by electing to go to provincial universities or municipal polytechnics
(Annex 4 contains details of admissions by province).
Types of Universities
1.11      National Universities.  There are 96 key national universities,
26 are controlled by SEdC, the remainder by other ministries and agencies.
These institutions enroll an average of 5,000-8,000 undergraduate students
selected from the entire nation. Although constrained by dormitory limits,
undergraduate enrollment in these institutions has been increasing at 10-15%
p.a. in recent years.
1.12      Graduate programs are rapidly being initiated i , this type of insti-
tution. with over 441 doctoral programs in place by 1982.    Total graduate
enrollment has surpassed 50,000 in the Ill institutions which have been autho-
rized to offer doctoral programs. The distribution of authorized graduate
programs varies greatly; Beijing University offers 45 programs, whereas many
other universities offer only one program and 12 of the 29 provinces have no
university authorized to offer a graduate program.
1.13      National universities controlled by ministries other than SEdC
number over 200 and are usually more specialized with curricula directed to
the technical needs of the controlling ministry. Their lower division program
of studies is largely in standard science and social science disciplines with
the usual political education, foreign language and physical education
requirements (para. 1.09). In the upper division undergraduate students
specialize in narrow fields related to the needs of the controlling

and Universities. U.S. Department of Education 1982.



- 6 -
ministry. On the average, a technical ministry can meet only about 40Z of its
manpower needs through graduates of its own institutions. Many of these
institutions have graduate authorization but far fewer than the comprehensive
institutions.
1.14      Provincial Universities.  The major types of provincial universities
are comprehensive, normal (teacher education), technical, agricultural and
medical. The remainder specialize in such fields as fine arts, physical edu-
cation, commerce and foreign language (Annex 5). Comprehensive provincial
universities vary. In the larger provinces they are nearly the equivalent of
a national comprehensive university. Their curricula include most standard
disciplines with undergraduate and, to some extent, graduate programs. Stu-
dents are drawn exclusively from the province and are generally only slightly
less able as measured by the entrance examination. They will be assigned jobs
in the province upon graduation. However, in some cases in smaller provinces,
a so-called "comprehensive" university may h.ve a small enrollment and offer
fewer standard disciplines. Six provinces do not have a comprehens,ve
university.
1.15      Normal universities and colleges are the largest category of provin-
cial institutions with over one-third (233) of the total (601). They are
divided into two classes:
(a) "Major" normal universities total about 70 institutions, offering a
four-year bachelor's degree program and usually a few graduate pro-
grams as well. These institutions devote most of their resources to
training upper secondary school teachers, but also produce profes-
sional manpower for: (1) upper secondary normal schools which pre-
pare primary teachers; (2) "minor" normal colleges (see below),
(3) provincial and sub-provincial educational administration;
(4) the university itself; and (5) graduate programs, usually in the
same university. Students are drawn from the province as a whole.
About 85% of the graduates actually go into education (about 65Z
into teaching) immediately after graduation.
(b) About 160 "minor" normal colleges offer two- or three-year, non-
degree programs for the training of lower secondary school teachers.
These institutions are structured to serve a clearly-defined geo-
graphic portion of the province, and average four to seven per
province. These colleges are one of the most neglected segments of
Chinese higher education, suffering from the low prestige awarded to
the teaching profession and the fact that they offer only a non-
degree program.
1.16      The two types of provincial normal institutions are pert of the
Chinese pre-service teacher education pyramid, which consists of five cate-
gories of institutions (Table 1.4). The two national universities at the apex
of the teacher education pyramid prepare very few teachers for the primary and
secondary levels of education. Their output goes either into graduate educa-
tion, staff for institutions in the lower categories of the pyramid or educa-
tional administration. The four regional normal universities, also controlled
by SEdC , serve much the same purpose as the two at the apex but produce more

teachers. They also conduct correspondence programs which play a major role
in the current crash programs for upgrading the qualifications of upper
secondary teachers.
1.17      Major provincial normal universities play the most central role at
present in view of the anticipated huge increase in the number of upper
secondary teachers needed between 1984 and 2000 (Table 1.1). They are often
as comprehensive as provincial comprehensive universities because the academic
departments needed to produce teachers for the curricuLa of upper secondary
schools cover nearly all aspects of a liberal arts university (Annex 3). The
norm is 10-12 departments (a few of which are further subdivided):

The list of departments mirrors the curricula of a typical tipper secondary
school. A preliminary analysis comparing the distribution of students of
sample normal universities by departments and the distribution of teachers of
sample upper secondary schools by specialization indicates that the normaL
universities are enrolling students by and large in the proportion required by
the upper secondary schools with the following two notable exceptions:
(a) there is a significantly lower proportion of students specializing in
foreign languages than the proportion of teachers needed in that discipline;
and (b) there is a somewhat higher proportion of students specializing in
biology than the proportion of biology teachers (Annex 6). Students are
assigned to one department as freshmen and do virtually no study under other
departments except for the required courses in physical education, political
education and foreign languages. Education/psychology departments are
especially weak in well-trained staff. Moreover, the number of contact hours
for prospective teachers in all subject areas need to be increased and



pedagogical aspects introduced more in subject area courses. Normal
universities have a distinctive character attributed to the fact that the
university often offers the province's only program in fine arts, foreign
languages, physical education and the language and history of minority
populations in the province. In many ways the major provincial normal
university becomes the province's seat of culture.
1.18      The minor normal colleges prepare teachers for lower secondary
schools. At the bottom of the teacher education pyramid, the approximately
1,000 upper secondary normal schools prepare primary school teachers in a
three-7ear program. The provincial normal universities provide the staff for
these two levels of institution.
1.19      Provincial Technical Universities and Colleges, numbering 59 nation-
wide, provide programs in selected fields in science and engineering. They
are akin to the technical universities under national ministries other than
SEdC. These institutions are important to the development of the provinces,
since curricula and program are articulated with the needs of the provincial
economies.
1.20      Provincial Medical and Agricultural Colleges (numbering 91 and 42,
respectively) are limited in curricula, but not in distinction nor in their
contribution to provincial development. The nationally controlled medical and
agricultural colleges are unevenly distributed among provinces and the
national system of graduate assignment is far from perfect. As a result,
provinces may well have an unmet demand in these two important sectors.
Moreover, in both sectors there are needs for new professional staff beyond
what the national institutions can provide. Also both sectors provincial con-
ditions vary and specialized training is needed. Health problems and their
solutions vary between provinces and even within provinces. Similarly,
agriculture must reflect climate and soil variations between provinces.
Finance of Higher Education
1.21      Higher education institutions are financed largely by the authority
responsible for management. Universities under SEdC are funded within SEdC's
budget. The same principle applies for institutions under technical mini-
stries and the provinces. The Bank Group estimates that on a national level
about 22% of recurrent expenditure on education is allocated to higher educa-
tion. This share has fallen marginally since 1980 as public expenditure on
education overall has grow,r about 10% a year and in 1984 comprised about 8% of
total public expenditure.4 Unit recurrent expenditure in higher education
averaged about Y 2,000 in 1983, with key universities under SEdC and technical
ministries about 20-30% higher, depending on field of study, and provincial
and normal universities about 20-30% lower. Annual capital expenditure is
estimated at about 10% of total recurrent expenditure and is mainly for expan-
sion of physicaL plant and facilities and for much needed equipment. China
41   Financial support for education at all levels comprises 3.1 of GNP which
is equivalent to the lower quartile of developing countries (Annex 1).

estimates that its GCP will triple before the end of the century. Bank Group
staff estimates that this anticipated economic growth - together with favor-
able demographic trends and possibilities of improving internal efficiency -
offers China the opportunity both to meet the financial needs of planned
educational development and achieve quality improvements, without sharp
increases in its allocation to higher education as a share of GNP.
1.22      Despite this largely favorable trend, resources for expansion and
improvement of education are insufficient and Chinese authorities are explor-
ing options to improve resource allocation among educational levels and
increase resource mobilization. Although fees and related charges are applied
at primary and secondary levels in China, most full-time students of higher
education are provided free tuition along with full boarding and subsidies for
food. Direct subsidies for students in universities can average as much as
20X of the institution's recurrent expenditure. Moreover unit recurrent costs
in higher education are about 50 times those in primary education and 15 times
those in secondary education. The Government has announced plans for gradual
application of tuition fees for university students, including charges of full
cost for students sponsored by their work units, combined with an increase in
the proportion of non-boarding students in those urban locations where reason-
able alternatives exist. However, in consideration of poverty areas, the
Government plans to eliminate primary and lower secondary tuition and school
fees for rural families in poor and remote areas.
II.  GOVERNMENT AND BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
National Objectives in Higher Education
2.01      The Government has adopted three principal objectives for higher
education: (a) enrollment expansion, especially in graduate programs;
(b) improvement of teaching and research programs; and (c) management reform.
Enrollment Expansion
2.02      The Government is keenly aware of the substantial waste inherent in
providing less than 5% of the nation's youth with opportunity for education
beyond secondary school, and places great reliance on international compari-
son, especially with the more advanced developing nations (Chart 1). In 1985
China's higher education enrollment ratio surpassed the LDC median and reached
4.8%. For the upper quartile of developing nations, a level which China
aspires to reach, the ratio is now 11.0x. Projections to the year 2000 sug-
gest that the upper quartile of developing nations will reach 15% or higher.
While useful for indicating the direction and pace of change, international
comparisons of higher education enrollments must be viewed cauti3usly.  Taken
alone, they provide no explanation of differing historical conditions that
have fostered or impeded formal higher education. They provide no evidence of
quality. Nor do they generally capture significant non-formal approaches in
China such as spare-time worker's education, correspondence programs and
television university systems. However, three enrollment ratios (percentage
of the undergraduate age cohort - 19-22 - which is enrolled in higher

2.03      A second rationale for expansion of higher education enrollment
derives from the skewed education pyramid (Table 2.1). Largely because of the
Cultural Revolution, which stopped or hampered higher, upper secondary and
technical education for 10 years, the proportion of persons with advanced
educational qualifications is relatively low (less than 1%), - smaller,
indeed, in the 25-34 age group than among those over 35 - in relation to the
relatively high proportion possessing primary education (over 65Z).

2.04      In addition, China's many years of isolation and corresponding
disregard of higher education have contributed to the smallness of stock of
manpower equipped to apply or to teach the skills essential for moderniza-
tion. Table 2.2, compiled by the Bank Group from the 1982 census, shows that
only 1.4% of staff across key sectors have university level or higher qualifi-
cations. These percentages are between one quarter and one tenth of the cor-
responding levels in a,yet of comparator countries (including United States,
Japan, Brazil, Mexico)" . Optimal percentages will, of course, vary by
country and sector depending on level of technology, relative earnings of

applied to each country's population pyramid which differ in shape. For
the target year of 2000, in China and Korea the percentage of the total
population in the college age years is 7-8% while in Mexico, Brazil and
India the comparable figure is the 9-11% range.

workers and level of economic development. By all measures, however, China is
seriously understocked with high level technical manpower.

2.05      To reach the medium target of 12.5% undergraduate enrollment rates
in 2000 (Chart 1), the higher education system enrollment would need to triple
in about 15 years - a formidable task. However, with the growth of graduate
programs to train new faculty, use of non-conventional delivery methods and
increase in student:staff ratios, the target is attainable. It can be accom-
plished in three ways: (a) expansion of enrollment in existing institutions;
(b) establishment of new institutions; and Cc) further development of non-
conventional approaches such as the television universities, correspondence
programs, and spare-time universities. Although enrollments and enrollment
ratios have grown sharply (Chart 1), there is ample opportunity for further



- 14 -
expansion since the average institutional enrol ient of about 6,000 is still
below the level for optimum economies of scale.-   In the same period, the
number of higher education institutions in China has risen from 675 to 902.
While this has in many cases increased access to higher education from areas
previously under-represented, the creation of a large number of relatively
small institutions has also contributed, in the short-run, to keeping the
institutional size uneconomically small. In the next stage of expansion,
there should be greater emphasis on increasing enrollments in existing insti-
tutions. Greater use of non-conventional delivery methods is another pro-
mising avenue to increased enrollment at low cost. The television university
system has already reached its original enrollment target for 1990 and is
still growing. The polytechnic system introduced in 1982, with Bank Group
assistance, has grown from an initial system of 17 institutions to over
80 institutions in 1985. Scenarios to reach alternative enrollment ratios by
2000 are suggested (Table 2.3). The principal constraint to reaching the tar-
get will be quantity and quality of faculty.

2.06      Graduate Enrollment.  An equally important national objective is to
expand post-graduate education. Since 1979, universities and colleges have
been authorized to launch master's and doctoral degree programs and by 1982,
over 400 doctoral programs were authorized in 111 national institutions
(para. 1.12). But to authorize programs without an overall framework for
planning of graduate education is to invite proliferation and duplication. In
the Second University Development Project, criteria were identified for set-
ting up new graduate programs relating to: (1) broader fields of study;
7/   A recent Bank study covering nearly 200 universities in China shows that
unit recurrent costs decline substantially as size increases towards
about 9,000 students.



- 15 -
(2) the provision of at least two full or associate professors in the field;
(3) minimal requirements of equipment for doctoral research; and (4) adequate
library holdings, in number and diversity. Comparative figures may be of use
in estimating the size of the graduate effort. In 1983 graduate schools in
the United States awarded 32,000 doctoral degrees and 340,000 master degrees.
In the sAme year, undergraduate enrollment was 11.2 million. If an equivalent
measure representing 3.3Z of the 1983 undergraduate enrollment is used, a
reasonable target for China in 2000 might be 50,000 doctoral students and
300,000 students at the master's degree level.
Improvement of Teaching and Research Programs
2.07      There would be little point in increasing enrollment without a con-
c-omitant qualitative improvement in the program of instruction provided to
students. This objective has many dimensions, including:
(a) Broader curricula - more flexibility of course choice for students.
(b) More relevant curricula - revisions to keep curricula up-to-date in
terms of industrial, commercial, agricultural and governmental
needs.
Cc) Improved competence of faculty to teach.
Cd) Improved competence of faculty and other staff to conduct research
including management of research and selection of more suitable
research topics.
(e) Provision of adequate equipment to conduct all experiments required
under the curriculum.
Cf) Improved facilities design in relation to the objectives of
educational programs.
Specific changes will be made toward broader curricula and more student choice
by: (a) allowing a greater percentage of electives in a major; (b) permit-
ting electives in other related (or even unrelated) majors; (c) introducing
interdepartmental majors; (d) delaying the choice of major from admission to
the second or third academic year; and (e) introducing a credit hour system
instead of class group scheduling. More relevant curricula would include
introduction of such hybrid fields as biochemistry, microbiology, or environ-
mental engineering. These fields and many more are being openly discussed for
graduate and undergraduate education.
2.08      Specific targets for faculty improvement include:  (a) doctorate
holders in all department chairs; (b) at least 50% of full and associate pro-
fessors with doctoral degrees; and (c) at least 30% of teaching staff with
graduate degrees. A key move will be to send staff for advanced study either
to national or overseas institutions before age 35, so that over the next few
years a cohort of mature and fully educated staff would become available.
Such measures as student, peer and management evaluations of faculty perfor-
mance may be introduced. Improvements in faculty remuneration and promotion



- 16 -
policy are being considered. The International Advisory Panel and Chinese
Review Commission under the First University Development Project are develop-
ing policy recommendations on improvements in research including inter alia:
(a) peer review of the design and implementation of research; (b) development
of university research programs more reLated to the needs of the economy;
(c) more publication in national and international journals; and (d) exchang-
ing researchers between and among universities and the network ot scientific
research institutes. Decisions on acquisition of equipment will be based on
the fundamental criteria of the percentage of required experiments which a
department is unable to offer because of lack of equipment. While archi-
tectural and engineering changes in physical facilities will be a very slow
process, broad policy directions will certainly include such changes as an
outcome.
Management Reform
2.09      The Government in general, SEdC in particular and the universities
have recognized for nearly a decade (since the Cultural Revolution ended) that
higher education is suffering from many management deficiencies.  The key
indicator is the student-staff ratio of generally about 4 students to I staff
while foreign observers advocate higher ratios (approximately 8 to 1). The
objectives agreed under the First and Second University Development Projects
will continue to be pursued in order to improve the ratio, although in the
short and medium term some of the faculty qualification goals described above
will impede this goal and probably should take precedence.
2.10      Just as problems with student-staff ratios are recognized, so also
are space, equipment and time utilization issues. Bold plans are underway to
conduct baseline space and equipment utilization surveys in order to accumu-
late data on which improvements can be measured. Seminars on how to conduct
such surveys are being planned. Improvement in the use of student time is
also being considered. The present practice of student scheduling on a class
group basis leads to inefficiency in the use of student time and of space,
staff and equipment. A seminar on student records management is being
conducted. Library, computer and audio-visual center management is a topic of
constant discussion as is, increasingly, the management of other centrally
managed services such as the provision of housing and health services to
students and staff. Higher education financial management is a source of
conzern from the highest levels of SEdC and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to
the higher education institutional management. Departmental and program
budgeting and accounting is being considered. Such practices as depreciation
allowances and performance auditing are being proposed.
2.11      Among the many actions the Government has taken to improve the
management of higher education, is the move begun in 1983 to replace nearly
all university and college presidents who are over 60 years of age. New
presidents have been appointed in over 60% of the institutions in the last two
years. Many new vice presidents have also been appointed. Most of these new
leaders have overseas or local experiences which prepare them for the new
assignment.



- 17 -
2.12      Recent steps taker. towards reform (paras. 2.05-2.11) culminated in
May 1985 as the Government announced a wide-ranging package of policy changes
for China's educational system. A newly created State Education Commission
replaced the Ministry of Edu:ation and is to provide a more unified plannini
supervision of education development. Based on the premise that a large and
stable pool of qualified personnel is a fundamental requirement for the
country's modernization program, these reforms revolve around the main themes
of increased decentralization and operating autonomy. While the government
stressed that in the long run, success cf these reforms depends on its overall
ability to develop education at all levels, in the short-run the main sectors
to improve are:
(a) basic education: an essential target of the reforms. L-ocal
authorities are responsible for making basic education (up to grade
nine) universal between 1990 and 1995 for most of China and
according to local conditions for its more backward areas.
(b) secondary education: during the next five years, enrollment in
secondary vocational and technical schools is targeted to increase
so as to equal general ordinary secondary enrollment and the number
of schools offering specialized course is also to increase.
Cc) higher education: the current tuition-free/highly centralized
system is to be replaced by a network of autonomous colleges and
universities offering a wide range of majors and pursuing their own
research interests. While granted increased operating autonomy, for
hiring and promoting administrators, raising and investing their own
funds as well as shaping their curricula, individual colleges and
universities should also update both instructional materials and
teaching methods.
Bank Group Strategy and Assistance to Education in China
2.13      Through its sector work program and in dialogue with the Government,
the Bank Group has formulated an education sector lending strategy which
entails three lines of action:  (a) expand higher edue.ation and improve its
quality and management to provide more high level manpower; (b) develop
technical and vocational education to increase the supply of technicians and
skilled workers; and (c) strengthen the education of teachers and administra-
tors (through both in-service and pre-service training) and improve the
quality of teaching materials and management services for secondary and
primary education.
2.14      Experience with Past Lending.  In keeping with this approach, the
Bank Group approved in 1981 a University Development Project (Loan 2021/Credit
1167-CHA, US$200 million) to assist 28 major national universities in the
fields of science and technology. It also extended two loan/credits totalling
US$144 million, for the development of professional agricultural manpower in
1982 and 1984 (Credit 1297-CHA, Loan 2444/Credit 1500-CHA), and a credit of
US$85 million in 1983 for the development of polytechnics and television
education (Credit 1411-CHA). The Polytechnic/Television University Project is
helping China to establish a new system of two- to three-year technical



- 18 -
education to produce technicians and strengthen the television education
system to reach a greater number of youths. Both systems have the advantage
of accoamodating enrollment expansion at a lower cost than conventional
universities. A Rural Health and Medical Education Project (Credit 1472-CHA,
US$85 million of which US$43 million is for medical education) in 1984
provided assistance for improved education and research in core medical
colleges and research institutions. A second University Development Project
(Credit 1551-CHA, US$145 million), approved in February 1985, will contribute
to strengthening education in engineering, economics and finance in
approximately 3_ universities. Sector specific and project-related training
is also included in or is planned under Bank Group projects in agriculture,
energy and transportation.
2.15      To date by far the largest share of Bank Group assistance has been
directed to higher education. This pattern reflects the urgency of higher
educational development as China has embarked on the Four Modernizations
(modernization of agricuLture, industry, defense and technology). However,
balanced and equitable development requires upgrading and expansion of
education at other levels and paying attention to the educational needs of
particular sectors or provinces. Accordingly, the current lending strategy
has three themes: (a) increased emphasis on the education and -raining needs
of economic sectors which the Government and the Bank Group consider essential
for development; (b) support for the basic and vocational education needs of
provinces which are less developed or have other special needs; and (c)
continued support for higher education at a more moderate level compared to
the past five years. A variety of technical assistance and studies provide
the opportunity for advice and consultation on a number of policies, develop-
ment alternatives and educational reforms. In its sector work the Bank Group
is currentLy undertaking a study on manAgement and finance of higher education
which will include examining the effects of university size on average
recurrent costs. Research is also underway with Bank Group assistance on the
cost-effectiveness of different types of secondary education, including
secondary technical and vocational education.
2.16      The progress of ongoing projects has exceeded expectations.
Disbursements are running over 502 above appraisal estimates. Indicators show
that progress toward project objectives is being attained. Enrollment growth
targets are being exceeded in most cases. Qualitative measures of teaching
programs such as teacher quaLifications, percentage of experiments which the
institutions are able to offer, greater peer review of research, and more
modern library practices, are being reached or exceeded. Over 50% of the
graduates of the universities in the First University Development Project are
now considered "computer literate" by the Government, up from virtually zero
before the project. These results are some examples of progress toward
project objectives. Even more impressive is the major reforms of policy of
higher education which are emerging. The reform includes decentralization to
the provincial and institutional levels of decision making regarding such
diverse areas as student admission, curriculum content, degree requirements,
faculty promotions, departmental budgets, and building design. Two areas
where improvement is especially needed are: (a) more efficient and imagina-
tive civil works planning, design and execution; and (b) equipment justifica-
tion and procedures for selection.



- 19 -
2.17      Rationale for Bank Group Participation.  The proposed project is the
first to address specifically the needs of the conventional higher education
subsector of China's provincial institutions. It would include assistance to
the subsector in the poorer provinces and provinces previously not assisted by
the Bank Group. This could lead to more direct Bank Group contribution to
specific regions and provinces in China, as the process of decentralization
proceeds. The Bank Group's influence on higher education policy development
gained through the previous six projects would be extended to conventional
provincial higher education institutions and to provincial higher education
planning authorities. The project will contribute directly to improving the
quality and quantity of educated manpower in each province since the output of
these provincial universities will be employed in the respective province.
The contribution to teacher education should assist further development of
secondary and primary education, particularly in provinces that are behind
national averages in enrollment and quality of education.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Scope
3.01      The project will support the Government's program to develop higher
education at the pLovincial level through assistance to key provincial univer-
sities and provincial higher education authorities. It will continue support
to the three broad national objectives of enrollment expansion, educational
program improvement (emphasizing improved teacher education) and management
refoz.
3.02      The project will consist of two components:  (a) direct assistance
to 60 provincial universities in 28 provinces; and (b) planning assistance for
the higher education subsector. Under the first component the project would
provide civil works, equipment and staff development to: (a) expand enroll-
ment; (b) improve educational programs; and (c) improve university manage-
ment. Under the second component technical assistance will be provided to
SEdC and the provincial higher education bureaux (PHEBs) to strengthen their
planning and management capabilities and improve efficiency in the higher
education subsector. The component will include two comprehensive planning
activities in higher education masterplanning and teacher education to promote
staff training and experience for further planning and programming in tho! two
critical areO: of higher education and teacher education.
3.03      Selection of Project Universities.  The 60 universities proposed for
direct assistance (Table 3.1) were selected jointly by SEdC and the provincial
governments according to the following criteria:
1.   The university contributes to the supply of provincial high level
manpower needs for qualified secondary school teachers or other high
priority development fields.
2.   The university offers four-year undergraduate degree programs and
will either provide for 10% of the total provincial university

undergraduate intake or have a minimum enrollment of 100 in each of
its departments.
3.   Each university has a development plan approved by the provincial
government which includes proposals for enrollment expansion, pro-
gram improvement, staff development and management reform, and has
submitted to its provincial government the institutional require-
ments for civil works, equipment and staff development.
4.   For each institution the provincial government agrees to provide a
counterpart budget for capital investment in civil works and locally
procured equipment and a recurrent budget for meeting the planned
expansion of enrollment, teaching materials, maintenance of build-
ings and equipment and depreciation allowances.
3.04      The project universities are classified into five types:  normal
(28), comprehensive (18), technical (7), medical (5), and agricultural (2).
The types of universities selected by a province vary according to the
priorities of the respective provinces. Selection is also influenczd by the
existence of national and regional universities located in the province. All
provinces are represented by either a regional or provincial normal univer-
sity, indicating the importance attached to improving teacher education and
securing an adequate supply of qualified upper secondary school teachers. The
selected universities are leading universities in the provinces as shown by
the fact that the 60 project universities, representing 10% of the total of
600 provincial universities, enroll over 26% of the total students in provin-
cial universities (Table 3.2). With the assistance provided under the project
they will become models for other provincial universities in increasing
enrollment, improving the quality of educational programs and reforming
management.  This feature will 'e enhanced by the two planning activities in
the second component.
Project Components
Assistance to Provincial Universities ($372 million excluding contingncies)
3.05      Enrollment Expansion.  As an outcome of the project' total enroll-
ment in the 60 universities would increase from about 320,000 in 1984 t8 gover
500,000 in 1990 including about 220,000 "special" and "other" students,- an
increase of about 58% over the period (Table 3.3). Growth in undergraduate
enrollment would be from 200,000 to over 260,000, an increase of 30%.
Graduate enrollment would expand from about 5,200 in 1984 to about 25,000 in
1990, or an increase of over 380%. Enrollment expansion by type of insti-
tution is shown in Table 3.1. The average enrollment per institution would
increase from 5,500 to 8,400, thereby contributing to economies of scale
8/   "Special" enrollment is full-time in special curricula of less than 4
years duration; "Other" enrollment is short courses, usually less than
one semester, or evening courses which may extend for more than one
semester.

not feasible to revise Annexes 11 and 12 and the project costs to include a
slight reduction in civil works costs (not financed from the Credit proceeds)
caused by the reduced graduate enrollment.

(para. 2.05). The targets will be met by admitting more freshmen and first
year graduate students to project universities as physical facilities
(classrooms, labs and dormitories) and equipment provision are expanded as
part of the project (paras. 3.12-3.15). The staff development program will
make it possible to increase enrollment without reducing the quality of
teaching.
3.06      Educational Program Improvement.  The project will raise the quality
of instruction by supporting: (a) a staff development program to improve the
academic and professional competence of faculty (Table 3.4); (b) improved
curricula and teaching methods through the provision of adequate equipment to
conduct experiments required under the curriculum and the introduction of
alternative teaching methods such as audio-visual and computer assisted
instruction; (c) the pursuit of a more flexible and relevant curricula; and
(d) the improvement of academic support services. A particular concern at
normal universities is the teacher education curriculum where the proportion
of pedagogy/psychology courses is disproportionately low. Specific outcomes
over the project period would include the following (they are expressed as
target indicators to allow monitoring during project implementation and are
fully described in Annex 8):
(i) increase from 2% and less than 1% to about 15% and 3Z in the
percentage of faculty with masters and/or doctoral degrees
respectively (including those with equivalent educational
degrees), or a two year program (in lieu of a master's degree)
with an appropriate mix of local (80%) and foreign (20X) study;
(ii) lowering of the average faculty age by 3-5 years to reduce the
dependency on older persons;
(iii) ability to offer over 95% of experiments required in basic
undergraduate courses and 80% of those required in specialized
undergraduate courses;
(iv) lower percentage of compulsory courses and higher percentage of
optional courses;
(v) increased use of discussion method and audio-visual material;
(vi) more frequent practice of a delayed final decision on
undergraduate major until the second academic year.
Special attention will be given to improvement of the teacher education pro-
gram in normal universities where the project would resuit in che following
changes: (a) a greater reference to curriculum and teaching methods in
regular subject matter courses; {b) increased hours of practice teaching,
education and psychology courses; (c) the pursuit of a more flexible and
relevant curricula through the advisory programs of the Chinese and interna-
tional panels (para. 3.19); and td) the improvement of academic support
services (libraries, computer centers and audio-visual programs) through the
fellowship program and the contribution of the panels (para. 3.19).

3.07      Management Reform.  The project will result in improved utilization
of existing staff, space, equipment and facilities, and more efficient manage-
ment and administration in the universities, substantially reducing the dupli-
cation and waste presently characterizing university administration. Efforts
toward management reform will complement those for enrollment expansion and
program improvement. Outcomes of the reform will include the following:
(a) an increased student:faculty ratio (8:1 for normal universities and
7:1 for other universities);
(b) more intensive use of classrooms and laboratories;
(c) more hours of library operation;
(d)  increased percentage of commuting students;
(e) introduction of a student credit-hour system;



- 27 -
(f) more efficiency in the management of student and personnel records
and inventories of equipment and facilities; and
(g) provision of maintenance and depreciation allowances for equipment.
The means to achieve these objectives will result from study tours and semi-
nars for university managers and the advisory programs of the panels
(para. 3.19). This program of management reform is consonant with the objec-
tives of the recently announced educational reform (para. 2.12).
Assistance to Higher Education Development ($5 million excluding contingencies)
3.08      Through the practical experience gained in the execution of two
planning activities, the central and provincial higher education authorities
will strengthen their capacities to design and implement similar comprehensive
plans which have a long-term time frame and are linked to economic growth
rates and the manpower needs of major economic sectors. Furthermore, the
experiments would serve as a model of activities to plan quantitative and
qualitative improvements in the two key fields of higher education and teacher
education. While the provincial governments will be involved, responsibility
for coordinating and implementing these activities will rest with SEdC.
3.09      Provincial higher education masterplans will be prepared under the
project to assist each province in considering its future needs in light of
the broad national objectives of enrollment expansion, program improvement and
management reform. The following topics will be addressed:
(a) Baseline Data. Present 1986 status of higher education and post-
secondary education institutions with enrollment by years, speciali-
zations and sex; faculty numbers, ranks, fields and qualifications;
and educational space and equipment inventories. The present
enrollment status of each province is summarized in Annex 2.
(b) Enrollment Expansion. Projected numbers, types and locations of
higher and postsecondary institutions in detail for 2000 and enroll-
ment levels by specialization, including new specializations
presently not offered.
(c) Program development, to be interwoven with the enrollment expansion
section above, should include inter alia the following: (i) numbers
of faculty members needed by specialization, rank and degrees;
(ii) new specializations or combinations of specializations to be
added and specializations to be eliminated; (iii) new policies on
electives, interdisciplinary study, interinstitutional programs, and
(iv) research programs to assist provincial development.
(d) Management Reform. Organization plans for each institution will be
assembled showing procedures for management and qualifications of
managers. Procedures for management may be national, provincial or
institutional.



- 28 -
(e) Cost and Financing. Estimates of approximate expenditure per year
on recurrent costs as well as expected investment. Financing plans
will indicate sources and approximate levels of finance.
3.10      Provincial Teacher Education Plan.  Since the size and structure of
the primary and secondary education systems will experience major changes in
enrollment, enrollment ratios and (in the case of upper secondary schools)
curricula in the 1980s and 1990s, particular attention needs to be given at
both the national and provincial levels to both the size and quality of the
teaching force. For example, the expected decline in primary enrollment from
153 million in 1981 to 98 million in 2000 due to demographic changes will
drastically affecc demand for new primary teachers. At the lower and upper
secondary levels rising enro'lment ratios and demographic changes will result
in first an increasing and then falling demand for secondary school teachers.
Even more importantly, in-service training must receive attention to upgrade
hundreds of thousands of unqualified teachers at all levels (para. 1.06).
Policy initiatives for such upgrading have not been accompanied by sufficient
detailed planning at the provincial level.
3.11       he planning activity will begin assembling an inventory of the
existir1,, teacher stock by school and field(s) of study taught. Projections of
school enrollment will be essential to predict demand in 2000 and beyond, and
the activity would employ simulation techniques to analyze the variation
resulting from such policy alternatives as: high, medium or low enrollment
estimates, early or later retirement, and retention of marginally unqualified
teachers instead of demanding full qualifications. As a culminating exercise,
the demand data would be used to project future enrollment in each province's
normal colleges and universities.
Civil Works, Equipment and Technical Assistance
3.12      The project will provide funds for civil works, equipment, and tech-
nical assistance (including staff development), in order to attain the project
objectives listed above.
3.13      Civil Works.  Through the provision of civil works an estimated
total area of 1.4 million sq m at 60 sites will be constructed. Construction
costs have been calculated at about Y 425 million. In anticipation of the
project many universities have been provided special budgets by the provinces
to construct new buildings and remodel existing ones, and work in both catego-
ries is expected to be completed by end-1987. The additional and remodelled
space will accommodate the larger student body through provision of more
classrooms and laboratories. Furthermore it will enable new equipment for
teaching and administrative use to be installed and maintained properly in
space of adequate size and environmental control, thus contributing also to
program improvement and management reform. Early in the project four institu-
tional space utilization surveys will be undertaken with an aim to help esta-
blish models for space standards for future construction. The Association
will review plans and offer advice for improvement for buildings not yet
designed. The Government and the universities are expected to adopt a more
rigorous approach to facilities planning to achieve greater effectiveness -when



- 29 -
universities will have to bear the full costs of civil works instead of
receiving completed buildings as a subsidy from the Government.
3.14      Equipment procured under the project will contribute to:  improved
quality of instruction through enabling more experiments required in the cur-
riculum to be performed (para. 3.06(iii)) and by providing audio-visual equip-
ment and computers to be used for instruction; and expansion and upgrading of
libraries through provision of more library equipment and books. It will also
accommodate an expanded enrollment without compromising the quality of educa-
tion. Equipment will also be provided for better management of university
affairs, e.g., student registration, personnel records, inventories of
equipment and facilities, thereby contributing to improved efficiency.
3.15      Teaching equipment to be procured must be in line with project
objectives in accordance with the following priority ranking: (a) to improve
the quality of instruction; (b) to accommodate enrollment expansion; (c) to
provide services to departments to achieve more effective instruction; (d) to
assist in the management of university affairs; and (e) to do necessary
research. A limited amount of equipment will also be provided to assist the
two provincial plans. For equipment proposed for procurement with credit pro-
ceeds, the following additional guidelines are drawn: (a) foreign exchange
funds provided from sources other than the project are not available or suffi-
cient; (b) the program for which the proposed equipment is intended would have
an adequate number of qualified professional staff to make effective use of
the equipment; and (c) the building space in which the equipment will be used
would be ready by the time the equipment is delivered and would be of adequate
size with proper instellation of appropriate electrical, air conditioning,
anti-vibration or acoustical treatment (Annex 9).
3.16      Technical Assistance (Table 3.5 and Annex 10) will be addressed
through fellowships, study tours and seminars and specialist services pro-
grams. Improvement of educational programs in project universities and sup-
porting management reform for the universities and the higher education autho-
rities will also complement efforts toward enrollment expansion through
increasing the number of professionally qualified faculty under the staff
development program. Technical assistance will include assistance to higher
education development (specialists and study contracts). A summary of costs
is shown in Table 3.5.

3.17      Fellowships.  Under the staff development program, overseas and
local fellowships totalling an estimated 8,700 fellowship-years will be provi-
ded from domestic sources as well as credit proceeds. Fellowships will
principally support study for degrees at the master's and doctoral levels or
for advanced study. A target would be for the 638 departments with about
28,000 faculty, each to have 6 graduate degree holders or scholars with
equivalent educational levels at the end9gf the project, significantly
improving the quality of academic staff.-  The government agreed during
negotiations that fellowships will be awarded with selection procedures and
criteria agreed with the Association. Guidelines for the program will be as
follows (Annex 10): (a) both local and foreign education and training should
be considered and a balance between the two maintained; (b) each department
should seek to have a nucleus composed of graduate degree holders and the
older and more experienced faculty with equivalent scholastic attainments by
the end of the project; (c) special attention should be given to the staff in
the education/psychology departments of normal universities; (d) present
foreign language competence would not be a basis for selection of fellows who
will be trained sufficiently prior to undertaking overseas study; (e) staff
development plans should take into account non-project sources of finAncing
(viz., local currency for local education and training, the Government's
foreign exchange allocation for SEdC's annual fellowship programs and exchange
programs with foreign institutions).
9/   At present, graduate degree holders comprise:  2% (masters) and leso than
1% (doctorates) of total staff. With an average of six per department,
these percentages would rise to about 15% and 3% respectively, still
below international standards, but a significant improvement.



- 31 -
3.18      Study Tours and Seminars.  A second form of staff development will
consist of study tours and seminars led by specialists on selected management
and curricular topics. This will be limited in scope, in order to give
greater emphasis to fellowships for departmental faculty improvement.
3.19      Specialist Services and International Advisory Panel.  Overall mana-
gerial and administrative efficiency of the higher education authorities will
increase as a result of technical assistance provided thrctgh an IAP which
would advise SEdC on project implementation and specialist services for semi-
nars and workshops addressing program improvement (in particular, curricula
development), planning and management reform, both on an institutional and
subsectorwide level. The IAP for this project will be chaired by a distin-
guished academic administrator and supported by a secretariat in keeping with
the successful experience in previous projects. Panel expertise will include
general higher education management, higher education planning and teacher
education planning. The IAP, in collaboration with a Chinese Review Commis-
sion consisting of local higher education experts, will identify for SEdC the
locations abroad from which the most suitable resources can be drawn for the
specialist services and fellowship programs. Two hundred and forty man-months
of specialist services, to contribute mainly to curricula and management
reform, will be provided through visits by high level specialists to individ-
ual institutions and participation in national or regional seminars
introducing techniques and procedures for such reforms.
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.20      Progress toward project objectives will be monitored through three
approaches.
(a) A set of measurable indicators has been agreed upon with the
Government during negotiations (Annex 8). Each indicator has a
target figure which the project universities plan to attain by the
end of the project. The target figures translate the project
objectives into quantifiable indices and relate to the following
objectives: quantitative expansion, management improvement, staff
development, curricula development (with special reference to
teacher education in normal universities) and others. Some are
similar to indicators used in previous education projects which
would allow for comparison while others, such as those concerning
the normal universities, are unique to the project. Progress toward
project objectives will be monitored against these indicators
annually, at a mid-project review, at project completion, and in
1995 after the project is completed.
(b) Specialists selected with the assistance of the CRC and IAP for
visits to individual institutions and seminars, subject to approval
of SEdC, will prepare reports with recommendations for more
effective project implementation. These reports will be synthesized
as part of project evaluation; and
(c) The CRC and IAP will develop additional measures for evaluation.



- 32 -
3.21      Annual progress reports will be submitted each year in February
starting in 1988. While these reoorts will also include the status -of
physical execution, special emphasis will be placed on remaining progress
toward meeting project objectives. The annual progress report to be submitted
in February 1989 will become the basis for an especialiv intensive mid-project
review articulated with the evaluation activities of the CRC and IAP.
Progress on the performance indicators will also be reviewed at this time.
IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION
Costs
4.01      Summary of Costs.  The total cost of the project including

Tb   For duties and taxes see para. 4.06
4.02      Basi. of Cost Estimates.  Base costs refer to April 1986 price-.
Civil2works costs for new building wiere estimated on the basis of unit costs
per m in recent building contracts awarded by the related provincial govern-
ments.  Accomodation schedules were not available, as universities were not
yet ready to adopt the micro-analysis mechodoLogy. Instead, the areas
required were based on macro-analysis (a fixed area for each new student
capacity at undergraduate and graduate Levels) used by SEdC for overall plan-
ning purposes (para. 3.13). The cost of furniture is estimated as 82 of the
civil works costs due to its relatively Low price in China. The cost of
equipment is based on recent bid prices under ongoing Bank Group-assisted edu-
cation projects and on preliminary lists prepared by each project institution,
reviewed and modified at several levels including the CRC and IAP and subse-
quently to be concurred by the Association on the final list with agreed
specifications (para. 3.14-15). Technical assistance needs are shown in
Annex 10. Unit costs for fellowships are estimated at about US$1,000 per man-



- 35 -
month for overseas fellowships and US$1,500 per trainee per year for local
training.
4.03      Foreign Exchange Components (f.e.c.).  The f.e.c. are estimated as
follows: civil works including furniture - liZ; equipment - 90%; specialist
services and fellowships - 50Z; and assistance to higher education development
- 33Z. The low f.e.c. estimate for civil works is consistent with estimates
in the Second University Development Project approved in February 1985. Other
estimates are largely consistent with previous Bank Group-financed education
projects, but with minor adjustments.
4.04      Utilization factor and unit cost.  Utilization factors for class-
rooms, laboratories and workshops are not available due to the lack of micro-
analysis (para. 4.02). However, unit costs per student place (Annex 11) are
reasonable, as the average of US$4,600 compares favorably with the median for
Bank Group education projects of US$16,500 per student place at university
level, both excluding contingencies. The significant gap is because the
additional capacities are created as extensions to existing institutions
instead of totally new places. The higher unit cost for the medical colleges
(US$6,600) is also acceptable. Table 4.3 summarizes the unit costs by type of
institutions.

4.05      Contingency Allowances.  The contingency allowances (.n US$) of
US$100 million includes: (a) physical contingencies estimated at 10Z of the
base costs of civil works, furniture, equipment, specialist services, fellow-
ships and assistance to higher education development studies and (b) price
contingencies amountirg to 16% of the base cost plus physical contingencies.
Annual price escalation rates were applied to both domestic and foreign costs
(in accordance with Bank Group guidelines) as follows: 7.0% in 1986, and
1987, 7.5% in 1988, 7.7% in 1989, 7.6% in 1990, and 4.5% in 1991 and 1992.
The contingency estimates are shown in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 above.

4.06      Duties and Taxes.  The project cost includes an indirect cost of
duties and taxes on civil works, the amount of which is not available. Such
costs, however, are financed by the Government. Imported instructional equip-
ment is exempt from import duties. Estimated cost on technical assistance
does not include duties and direct taxes, as these are inapplicable.
Financing
4.07      Capital Costs.  Out of the total project cost of US$477 million, the
Government will finance US$357 million equivalent (75Z) and IDA, US$120
million (25%), representing 44% of the estimated foreign exchange costs.

4.08      Operating Costs.  The projeci yhen in full operation with an
additional enrollment of about 80,000 °u will generate an estimated recurrent
expenditure of about US$45 million p.a. at 1985 prices which consists of:
(a) estimated average unit recurrent cost per student at US$400 from recent
higher education cost studies; (b) an increase of 10Z for an improved supply
of teaching materials and better maintenance and repair; and (c) a 5% depre-
ciation allowance on equipment. This represents less than 7% of the present
annual recurrent expenditure budget in higher education, while the planned
enrollment increase exceeds 7% of the present enrollment in existing univer-
sities. There should be no budgetary constraint to the Government caused by
the project, and there is some likelihood of a reduced financial burden to the
10/ Undergraduate and graduate students only (para. 3.05 and Table 3.2).

partially recovered by fees, as a result of the Government's changing
policies.
Implementation
4.09      Responsibility for implementing the project will rest with SEdC.
The Vice Chairman for Planning and Development, SEdC, will carry the overall
responsibility for directing the project. Because of its complexity (60 uni-
versities in 28 provinces), the project will be managed by a committee and an
office. At the higher level a Steering Committee has been established, which
has as its members the Vice Chairman and senior officials from SEdC bureaux
concerned, viz., the Foreign Investment and Loan Office (FILO), the Planning
Department and the External Affairs Bureau responsible for implementation,
planning and relations with provinces respectively. It is chaired by the Vice
Chairman. FILO will be assisted in implementation by experts and administra-
tive staff from the project universities. The FILO consists of a secretariat
and four divisions, namely Project Coordination, Equipment Procurement,
Specialists and Fellowship Affairs, and Accounting (Chart 2).
4.10      At the provincial level, a project office has been established with-
in PHEB in some provinces and an existing division has been assigned to take
responsiblity for implementing the project in other provinces (Chart 2). It
is headed by a Deputy Director of the PHEB who will guide project implementa-
tion and coordinate with the universities and the related technical ministries
on matters involving the provincial government and the technical ministries.
He reports to the FILO Projects Director, transmits university requirements on
equipment and technical assistance to FILO and obtain data as required by
FILO.
4.11      At the institutional level a loan office has been established in
each project university headed by a vice president. A managing director is
responsible for detailed project management such as the receipt and inspection
of equipment delivered, the logistics for arranging accommodation and
schedules for specialists visiting the university, and two-three staff respon-
sible for software and hardware. The civil works are managed by the universi-
ties with budget approved by the provincial government. The university loan
office reports to the PHEB Deputy Director. The Government has agreed during
negotiations that the Steering Committee, provincial project offices and
university loan offices will be maintained with staff, responsibilities and
functions acceptable to the Association.
4.12      Aside from the Steering Committee, a Chinese Review Commission (CRC)
and an International Advisory Panel (IAP) have been established for the pur-
pose of the project. The CRC consists of approximately twenty local experts
on equipment and staff development needs of the project universities. It will
be active in applying the agreed criteria for equipment procurement and
fellowships and determining the requirement for specialist services and
fellowships during project implementation. It will have regular joint
meetings with the IAP to guide and monitor project implementation. The IAP
consists of three persons, a chairman and two vice chairmen, assisted by a
secretariat (para. 3.19). The Government has agreed during negotiations that

the IAP and CRC will be maintained with staff responsibilities and functions
acceptable to the Association.
4.13      The Government intends to manage the project with speed as well as
with the least amount of commitment charges. Accordingly, the Government's
processing of the project will be designed to synchronize with the Associa-
tion's processing cycle (Annex 13). Schedules of implementation are shown in
Annex 14. The Completion Date will be December 31, 1990, and the Closing
Date, December 31, 1991.
.-14      Status of Project Preparation.  The project is in an advanced stage
of preparation. Most civil works would be completed or near completion by
mid-1986. Equipment lists and specifications have been reviewed by the CRC,
the IAP and the Association. Commercial terms of the bid documents will be
substantially the same as those used for previous education projects. The
final bid documents will be printed by about ApriL 1986 and submission of bids
will be invited by aboat May 1986. It is expected that bid evaluation will be
completed and contracts signed shortly after credit effectiveness. The IAP
has commenced work before credit signing on specialists selection and
appointment, discussions on curriculum improvement and providing advice on
equipment and university administration. Fellowship selection will be
completed by mid-1986 for the first group of scholars to be placed in overseas
universities in September, 1986.
Procurement
4.15      Procurem-nt arrangements will be largely the same as those used in
previous education projects in China and are sum.arized in the table below:

Note: Figures in bracket denote the amount of the Association's financing.
4.16      Civil works and furniture, all financed by the Government, will be
contracted through established local procedures. The credit will finance
about US$100 million equivalent of instructional equipment including books and
journals and about US$20 million equivalent of technical assistance. About
83% of the equipment from credit proceeds will be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) and the remainder through direct purchase
or limited international bidding. Equipment financed from Government funds
will be procured through local competitive bidding under local procedures
which are acceptable to the Association.
4.17      The International Tendering Company (ITC) of CNTIC will continue to
be the procurement agency responsible for inviting bids, participating in bid
evaluation and signing and enforcing contracts as under previous education
projects. Equipment items for the project will be grouped, to the extent
possible, into packages for bulk procurement. Contracts estimated to cost
US$200,000 or more will be awarded in accordance with the procurement
procedures under ICB as set out in the Bank Guidelines for Procurement dated
May 1985. Local manufacturers will be eligible to participate and will be

extended a 152 preference margin, or the prevailing custom duties, whizhever
is lower, i-i bid evaluation. Items or groups of items estimated to cost less
than US$200,000 in each contract and not exceeding an aggregate amount of
US$5 million may be procured through limited international bidding whereby
contracts will be awarded on the basis of comparison and evaluation of
quotations obtained from at least three suppliers. Proprietary items or where
justified by the need for standardization, up to an aggregate of US$7 million
may be purchased directly. Books and journals estimated to cost about
US$5 million will be procured directly from suppliers after negotiations for
the best discount. Based on experience gained with good performance on equip-
ment procurement implementation in China since the first project signed in
1981 and throughout all subsequent projects, indicating no irregularities with
about US$300 million of equipment contracts evaluated and signed, awards on
contracts valued at US$500,000 or more will be subject to Bank Group prior
review instead of the US$200,000 threshold as set in the Second University
Development Project under Credit 1551-CHA. It is expected that such review of
equipment awards will cover about 3Z of the number and about 34% of the total
value of all contracts awarded through ICB. The Association will also review
the bid document before each major tendering exercise. All specialists will
be selected and appointed in accordance with the principLes and procedures
satisfactory to the Association on the basis of Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency
dated August 1981. Procedures for selecting and placing of fellowships will
be the same as in previous education projects (reference: Procedures and
Criteria for Fellowship Awards, Report No. 5271b-CHA - Annex 13).
Disbursement
4.18      The credit of US$120 million equivalent will be disbursed over a
period of 5 1/2 years (Table 4.6). Disbursements will be made on the basis
of: (a) 100% of the foreign expenditures on imported equipment, books and
journals, or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment; (b) 75% of
local expenditures for other equipment procured locally, and (c) 100% of the
expenditures for specialist services, exchange programs, overseas fellowships
and overseas study tours. Disbursement profiles of previous education pro-
jects in China indicate a faster pace than both the regional average of all
projects and the Bank Group average of all education projects. It is there-
fore expected that disbursements would be compLeted before December 31, 1991.
4.19      In order to facilitate the Association's processing of disbursement
applications, a minimum level for withdrawal application will be US$200,000.
Disbursement applications for contracts valued at US$200,000 or more will be
submitted to the Association with two copies of the contracts and other
supporting documents. For exchange programs, fellowships, study tours and
expenditures incurred under contracts below US$200,000, statements of
expenditure (SOEs) certified by authorized government officials will be
used. In this case, contracts and supporting documents will be retained by
the Foreign Investment and Loan Office, State Education Commission, Beijing,
and, upon request, will be made available for review by visiting missions from
the Association. Disbursements against SOEs would be made on the basis of a
consolidated summary, each not less than US$200,000. Disbursements for other
project expenditures will be made against full documentation.

4.20      For the project, a special account will be established and main-
tained in US dollars in a bank acceptable to the Association to facilitate
disbursements for eligible project expenditures. An initial deposit of US$
equivalent of SDR 5.0 million representing four months' average project
expenditures to be covered through the Special Account.  Applications for
replenishment of the special account will be submitted quarterly, or more
frequently if necessary, with certified SOEs as supporting documentation for
disbursements against exchAnge programs, fellowships, study tours and expend-
itures against contracts below US$200,000 and full documentation for all other
expenditures.
Accounts and Audits
4.21      Project accounts for both components, viz., Provincial University
Development and preparation of future projects including studies, will be
maintained by FILO (Chart 2). Accounts related to the universities will also
be maintained at the PHEB Project Offices. Each project university will main-
tain accounts relating to itself. The Audit Administration of the People's
Republic of China (AAPRC) will audit these cash flow accounts (not to include
indirect foreign exchange calculations). The Government agreed during negoti-
ations that: (a) project accounts will be maintained by the project entities
as described above according to principles and practices satisfactory to the
Association; (b) annual audit reports will be submitted to the Association
within eight months of the end of the Government's fiscal year; and (c) six
months after the Closing Date the Government will submit a project completion
report to the Association.
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      Benefits.  Significant benefits would result from each project
component. The provincial universities assistance component would assist
leading provincial institutions to: (a) increase undergraduate enrollment by
30Z and increase graduate enrollment almost five-fold; (b) improve educational
program to: (i) enabLe departments to offer over 95% of required experiments
in science fields; (ii) improve faculty qualifications through local and
foreign fellowship programs aiming toward a target of 6 graduate degree
holders in each department including whose with equivalent educational levels,
compared to a current average of 2Z for masters and less than 1% for
doctorates; (iii) provide spezial assistance to the further development of the
education/psychology departments of normal universities which are at present
in need of improvement; and (c) improve management efficiency by means of
policies for more economical use of resources. Through these and many other
measures, the beneficial effects of the two previous higher education projects
would be extended to the provincial segment of conventional higher education
which enrolls 60% of the total enrollment and comprises two-thirds of the
total number of institutions.



- 44 -
5.02      The assistance to higher education development would have a long-
range impact in guiding the development of higher education. The higher
education masterplans would set enrollment targets, locate areas where new
institutions are needed, identify priority fields of study in relation to the
manpower needs of industry, agriculture and government, more clearly define
institutional roles to avoid unprofitable duplication, assist more rational
faculty and staff deployment, contribute to improved civil works policy,
design and utilization and support a more rational policy for equipment
allocation, procurement, utilization, maintenance and replacement. The
teacher education plans would assist the provinces to address the nation's
unprecedented problems of matching teacher supply and demand in a period of
sharp demographic change and education reform.
5.03      Risks. The principal risk of the project would lie in the variation
of implementa-ion ability among the 28 provinces. This risk is reduced by the
following: (a) excellent performance in project implementation exhibited by
SEdC in the First University Development Project and the Polytechnic/
Television University Project where the project beneficiaries are also provin-
cial institutions; (b) active involvement of the SEdC Planning Bureau in
overall coordination of the two planning activities; (c) strong commitment
shown during appraisal by the province to meet criteria for inclusion in the
project in such matters as counterpart funds, maintenance and depreciation
budgets and early and ample financial commitments for civil works; and (d) the
contributions the IAP would make.
VI . AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations the Government has agreed to the following:
(a) Project-financed fellowships will be selected and organized in
accordance with agreed guidelines (para. 3.17 and Annex 10);
(b) Impact of the project will be measured by an agreed set of
indicators with target figures (para. 3.20 and Annex 8);
(c) The Steering Committee, the FILO, provincial project offices and
university loan offices established for the purpose of the project
will be maintained with staff, responsibilities and functions
acceptable to the Association (paras. 4.09-4.11);
(d) The IAP and the CRC will be maintained with staff, responsibilities
and functions acceptable to the Association (para. 4.12);
(e) Annual expenditure and performance audit reports and a project
completion report will be submitted to the Association according to
an agreed schedule (para. 4.21).



- 45 -
6.02      A condition for credit effectiveness is the approval by the
Borrower's State Council Of the Development Credit Agreement.
6.03      Subject to the above condition, the project will constitute a basis
for a Credit of SDR 108 million (US$120 million equilvalent) to the People's
Republic of China.

2.        Equipment for experiments or testing which are not mainly connected
with instruction or research within the institution concerned should not be
allocated under this project. Equipment proposed for acquisition under the
project should meet the following tests before it is proposed for procurement
with loan/credit proceeds:
(a) Equivalent equipment is not available from local sources;
(b) Foreign exchange funds provided from sources other than the
loan/credit are not available or sufficient;
(c) The program for which the proposed equipment is intended would have
professional staff in adequate number and with proper qualifications
for the effective use of the equipment; and
(d)  The building space in which the equipment will be used would be
ready by the time the equipment is delivered; the space should be of
adequate size with proF^r installations of necessary electrical,
air-conditioning or acoustical treatment depending on the type of
the equipment.

PROVINCIAL UNIVERSITIES PROJECT
Staff Development Programs
Staff Development in the project includes three activities:
1.   Fellowships - Local and Foreign
2.   Study Tours - Foreign
3.  Specialist Services - Local and Foreign
A. Fellowships
1.        The overall target for the fellowship program is to achieve an
average of 6 degree holders or scholars with the equivalent educational levels
in each of the approximately 635 departments of the 60 project institutions.
Total staff now number over 58,000 with slightly under half (28,165) holding
the title of professor, associate professor and lecturer. This group is
called titled staff and represents the prime source of fellows. The fellowship
plan calls for: (1) exclusion of the titled staff over age 60, (2) 20Z of
titled staff under age 60 being ineligible for other reasons, i.e., age,
health or lack of basic education and (3) varying proportions of other staff
(now untitled) being declared eligible. The result is slightly over 25,000
staff eligible to become fellows. The demand side begins with the target of 6
per department and with adjustments for estimated present degree holders;
those now in degree programs and an extra allowance of 2 per pedagogy/
psychology departments in normal universities. Total demand is estimated at
3,374 or 13Z of supply of eligible staff. This percentage is important
because the universities could lose this percentage of staff for training and
still continue to operate. The prevailing staff/student ratio of about 1:6 is
further evidence of capacity to absorb the absence of fellows.
2.        The fellowship plan covers both local and foreign fellowships and
will utilize financial resource beyond the capacity of the credit. It ia
estimated that 75Z of all fellowships would be local, made possible by the
rapid expansion since 1981 of masters and doctoral programs in China's leading
universities. Whenever possible, fellowships should be local, but in fields
of study not yet mature enough to have degree programs in China, foreign
fellowhips should be used. Even in fields with adequate local programs, a
mixture of foreign degree holders in a department would contribute to a more
rigorous instruction program.
3.        Three financial paths to funding foreign fellowships are included in
the plan: (1) credit funds; (2) exchange programs of project universities
with foreign institutions; and (3) other programs of the Government for
sending fellows. The plan includes varying proportion of masters and doctoral
fellows ranging from 80% masters/20% doctoral to 50%/50% depending upon

capacity of program and supply of eligible fellows. The number of years of
study needed for each degree also varies in the plan according to ezperienct:
from past projects and other programs from 1.8 years for a masters to 4.0
years for a doctorate. Finally, estimated costs per fellowship year also vary
from $1,500 for a local year to $12,000 for a fellowship supported by credit
funds (this figure is down from $15,000 in previous projects in line with
actual implementation experience). Total costs of the fellowship program are
estimated at $32.8 million (Y 92.5 million) for both local and foreign
programs from all sources of funding. Programs supported by credit funds
total $12.1 million (Y 33.9 million).
B.   Study Tours and Seminars
4.        A total of $750,000 (Y 2.1 million) is provided for group training
either locally or abroad where fellowships would not be the most efficient or
educationally sound method of training. Of the total, $500,000 credit funds
are to provide foreign exchange for overseas study tours and seminars and to
bring foreign lecturers for local seminars. The equivalent of half of this is
provided in local resources for locally based seminars. Study tours and
seminars will be especially needed to achieve improvements in university
management.
C.   Specialist Services
5.        Two types of specialist services are envisioned:  (1) subject matter
specialists to visit departments and (2) management specialists to visit
institutions, PHEBs and SEdC. Specialists, either local or foreign, would be
reviewed by the CRC and IAP, subject to approval of SEdC, and details of the
posting of foreign specialists would be handled by the IAP secretariat.
Requests for specialists would normally be initiated by the department or
institution, but the initiative could also come from the CRC, IAP or FILO.
The project calls for 240 man-months of foreign specialists and 400 man-months
local specialists. The total is based on the number of departments (635) to
be assisted and the proportion of foreign and local specialists is based on:
(1) an estimate of the supply of qualified local specialists, (2) the
absorptive capacity to receive foreign specialists, and (3) financial
constraints of the project. To the numbers cf specialist man-months shown
above (240 foreign and 400 local) must be added the services of the IAP and
CRC and the secretariat.
