EL BORMA-GABES GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Oil was first discovered in the southern desert of Tunisia at
El Borma in 1964 and production in commercial quantities started in 1966.
Associated with the oil is natural gas which comes out of the well when
oil is extracted.  There are no towns or villages in the area which could
use the gas and since the cost of storing the gas would be prohibitive,
this valuable natural resource has been flared off in the desert.
ii.       Societe Tunisienne de lVElectricite et du Gaz (STEG), a state
owned corporation, having decided to build a thermal power station at
Rhennouch near Gabes on the east coast and being aware that gas was being
flared some 300 km to the south, undertook a study to determine whether it
wwould be feasible to transport gas from El Borma by pipeline and use it as
a fuel in the power station. The study showed that using this gas would be
cheaper than using fuel oil.
iii.      The Bank and the Kuwait Fund have been asked by STEG to provide
loans to cover the foreign exchange component, estimated at US$10 million,
of a US$13.6 million project to build a gas pipeline from El Borma to Gabes.
The Kuwait Fund has agreed to a joint financing operation, its first with
the Bank, in which disbursements would be made parn passu, the Bank pro-
viding 75% of each disbursement and the Kuwait Fund 25%. The Kuwait Fund
has also agreed to accept the Bank's procedures for appraisal and procure-
ment of goods and services. The local currency component of the prolf:ict
(US$3.6 million) would be provided by STEC from internally generated .unds.
Consultants satisfactory to the Bank have designed the project and wi
supervise construction.
iv.       This would be the Bank's first loan to STEG. The Kuwait Fund has
made two previous loans to STEG for US$11.2 million in 1963 and US$12.9 mil-
lion in 1967. Both loans have been fully disbursed and the performance of
STEG under the loans has been satisfactory to the Kuwait Fund.
v.        STEG is a state owned corporation formed in 1962 to take over and
operate the assets of electricity and gas companies which had been national-
ized. Its main electricity generating station is at La Goulette, Tunis, and
electricity is distributed throughout northern and central Tunisia by a
national grid.
vi.       STEG's present management is efficient and well qualified but has
inherited many problems which it will take some time to solve. At lower



- ii -
echelons there is over staffing and not all the incumbents are suited for
their posts. A retraining program is under way and the number of staff is
gradually being reduced.
vii.      STEG i8 a financially profitable company making a considerable
contribution from its own resources to investment in fixed assets but
partly as a result of this heavy reliance on own resources, there is a
short-term liquidity problem. The financial rate of return of STEG on its
net fixed assets is estimated to rise from 2% to 4.5% by 1980. However,
this rate is depressed and distorted by STEG's conservative accounting and
depreciation policies. If the accounts are notionally adjusted to bring
them in line with normal practice in power companies, that rate would ave-
rage over 7.5% during the period, which is satisfactory.
viii.     The most probable discount rate at which the difference in the
cost and benefit streams of the proposed pipeline and the next best alter-
native is reduced to zero is 12%. This establishes the pipeline project
as the least cost solution for the supply of fuel to the new power plant,
which is estimated to have an economic rate of return in excess of 25%.
ix.       The proposed project is suitable for joint financing by Kuwait
Fund and Bank loans of US$2.5 million equivalent and US$7.5 million equivalent
respectively. A term of 16 years, corresponding to the life of the project,
with a grace period of 3 years, corresponding to the disbursement period,
would be appropriate.

EL BORMA-GABES GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG), a Govern-
men,t owned enterprise, has asked the Bank for a loan of US$7.5 million and
the Kuwait Fund for a loan of US$2.5 million to finance the foreign exchange
cost of a US$13.6 million high pressure pipeline to carry gas from El Borma
in southwest Tunisia to Gabes on the east coast. The Kuwait Fund has agreed
to a joint financing operation and to accept the Bank's appraisal and pro-
curement procedures.
1.02      The proposed loan would be the first made by the Bank under a
joint financing arrangement with the Kuwait Fund, the first for a pipeline
in Tunisia and the first by the Bank to STEG. The Kuwait Fund has made two
previous loans to STEG, the first in December 1963 for US$11.2 million
eqiuivalent and the second in January 1967 for US$12.9 million equivalent.
Both loans, which have been fully disbursed, were for the purchase and
installation of electricity generating equipment and transmission lines and
STEG's performance under the loans has been satisfactory to the Kuwait Fund.
1.03      STEG is now building a new generating station at Rhennouch near
Gabes. Financing has been arranged under bilateral arrangements with France,
tenders have been awarded and reclamation of land, which had been behind
schedule, has been speeded up as a result of the Bank's representations to
the Government. Large long lead equipment items and material are on order.
It is expected that the site will be completed by October 1970 and p1-nt
construction will go forward to completion for service for the wintei 'f
1972-73 as presently scheduled.
1.04      STEG, aware that gas associated with the crude oil being produced
at El Borma was being flared, commissioned a study which showed that this
gas could profitably be used as fuel for the new generating station by the
construction of a pipeline. It is estimated that gas will continue to be
produced until 1987. In addition to supplying gas to STEG, the pipeline
will also supply small amounts of gas to two industrial companies, Industries
Chimiques Maghrebines (ICM) and Briqueterie d'El Hamma.
1.05      This report is the result of a pre-appraisal mission in May 1970
and an appraisal mission in July 1970. Mr. S. Jaroudi of the Kuwait Fund,
Messrs. D. C. Elliott (Mission Chief), Y. Abe (Economist), and S.S. El-Fishawy
(Senior Counsel), all of the Bank staff, Messrs. Hu Harries and B. Rollins
of Hu Harries and Associates together with Mr. K. Sonney of Stone and
Webster (Overseas), Consultants retained by the Bank, participated in the
appraisal mission. The report was written by Messrs. Elliott, Abe, Harries,
Rollins and Sonney.

2. BACKGROUND
A.   General
2.01      The Republic of Tunisia covers an area of about 164,000 km2
about one-third the size of France and is bordered by the Mediterranean
to the north and east, Algeria to the west and Libya to the south and
southeast. Its population is about 4.7 million and has been increasing
at about 2.3% per annum since 1964. Most of the population and economic
activity are concentrated in the coastal areas and in the north, the
southern part of the country being almost deserted.
2.02      Tunisia's gross national product (GNP) in 1969 is estimated at
US$1,135 million with a per capita GNIP of US$230. The average annual growth
rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been about 3.5% over the 1965-1969
period. The main sectors in the economy are agriculture and manufacturing
generating respectively, 16% and 15% of GDP in 1969. Other important sectors
are commerce (14%), transportation, including communications (8%), building
and public works (8%) and mining (6%). The balance of payments during the
1960's showed persistent deficits in current account of about US$100 million
on annual average. The principal contributors to the foreign exchange
earnings are tourism, exports of agriculture products, mainly olive oil,
and exports of mineral products such as crude oil and phosphate products.
B.  The Power Sector
2.03      The present installed electric generating capacity in Tunisia
is about 258 MWI, 215 MW of which belongs to STEG and 43 MW to various in-
dustrial enterprises as captive plants. Thermal plants account for 87%
of STEG's generating capacity, and hydroelectric plants and a few diesel
generators for the remainder. The major power plants are at La Goulette
with a capacity of 168 MW. Three hydroelectric plants are located at El
Aroussia, Nabeur and Fernana in the northwest of Tunisia with 28 MW total
capacity. STEG's main energy source is fuel oil and in 1967-69 STEG's
consumption accounted for about 40% of total consumption of fuel oils in
the country, part of which is imported.
2.04      STEG completed the interconnection of the main consumer areas
by a national power grid in 1967. The system contains about 11,000 km
of transmission and distribution lines consisting of 1,200 km of high
tension line, 4,500 km of medium tension line and 5,100 km of low tension
line. Sales have increased by 10.4% per year on the average from 240 GWH
in 1961 to 533 GWH in 1969. The northern part of Tunisia, including Tunis,
Nabeuz, Bizerte and Jendouba accounts for about 70% of STEG's power sales.
Manufacturing industries are the major consumers of medium tension power
and households of low tension power.



-3-
2.05      STEG needs to increase its generating capacity to meet growing
electricity demand. Presently, STEG is constructing a 15 MW gas turbine
at Menzel Bourguiba to meet the electricity peak demand in 1971 and two
30 MW thermal generators at Rhennouch to meet demand from 1972 onwards. It
is the Rennouch station which will use natural gas as a fuel.
2.06      The location of generating plants and the national power grid are
shown on the Map.
C. The Petroleum Sector
2.07      Production of oil in Tunisia started in 1966 at the El Borma
field, owned by Societe Italo-Tunisienne d'Exploitation Petroliere (SITEP).
SITEP is jointly owned by the Government of Tunisia and AGIP, a subsidiary
of ENI, the Italian State holding company in the petroleum sector. Further
discoveries were made by Societe d'Etudes et de Recherches Pettrolieres
Ttmisienne (SEREPT) at Douleb in 1968. The total production reached about
4 million tons in 1969, of which 3.6 million tons were produced at El Borma.
Nci significant new discoveries have been made recently but the search for
new fields is continuing. The refinery at Bizerte owned by Societe Tuniso-
Italienne de Raffinage (STIR) started operations in 1963. In 1969 the capacity
of the refinery was estimated at 1.1 million tons per year and a plan to
increase the capacity to 1.5 million tons per year is presently under con-
sideration.
2.08      The commencement of domestic crude oil production in 1966 changed
the pattern of exports and imports of crude oil and related products. Tu-
n:Lsia started to export crude oil in 1966 and by 1969, 2.8 million tons,
worth US$40.3 million, were being exported. At the same time, imports of
all petroleum products were reduced from 758,000 tons in 1966 to 243,000
tons in 1969.
2.09      Transport of crude oil takes place largely by pipeline.  The
Map shows the pipelines existing in Tunisia.
2.10      There is at present no large commercial utilization of natural
gas in Tunisia. STEG manufactures gas for household use in Tunis using
natural gas from a nearby field. Total production of natural gas averages
about 900 Mcf per day of which about 60 Mcf is distributed directly to
industries in Tunis; the remaining natural gas is reformed to manufactured
gas and distributed to domestic customers. At El Borma field, natural gas
was first produced in 1966 by SITEP in association with crude oil.  Up to
now it has been flared. The availability of this gas has led to a project
for the transportation and utilization of natural gas as a fuel for STEG's
new generators which will be installed at Rhennouch. It is for this project
that a Bank loan has been requested.

3. THE BORROWER
A. Organization
3.01      Societe Tunisienne de L'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG) was created
by Decree-Law No. 62-8 of April 3, 1962 to take over and operate the assets
and liabilities of seven private utility companies which had been nation-
alized. At the request of the Tunisian Government and the shareholders,
the President of the Bank acted as conciliator in the settlement and his
recommendations issued in 1968 have now been implemented. STEG is a public
company wholly owned by the Government, whose equity is expressed by the
excess of assets over liabilities rather than share capital. The value of
the equity at December 31, 1969 was TD 37.9 million (US$72.3 million
equivalent).
3.02      STEG's early years were beset with problems all of which have not
yet been solved. Much of the equipment it inherited has now been replaced
and a national grid built up. The desire to turn over all posts in the
industry to Tunisians created a situation of over-recruitment, with many
of the recruits not suited for their responsibilities.
3.03      Records, particularly accounting records, were badly or inadequately
kept. Tariffs are basically those inherited from the seven previous companies,
although one of STEG's basic objectives, as laid down in the law of April,
1962, is to set tariffs to cover operating expenses and make a contribution
to further development.
3.04      The present management, which is competent and energetic, is
tackling these problems. Much of the obsolete equipment has been replaced
and a national grid built up. Contracts for installation of the new ge-
nerating station at Rhennouch have been awarded. A study has been made of
the staffing position. A recently developed program of retraining, early
retirement and a change in recruitment policies is already showing results.
This is particularly evident in senior management. All the senior posts
are manned by competent Tunisians and little outside help is needed, except
in the accounting field. STEG has made arrangements for Electricite de
France to second a senior accountant to them (see para. 6.02). At lower
levels the process will take longer. STEG has 3,150 employees while about
2,700 would suffice, and it will not be until 1975 that the staffing posi-
tion will be such that there is no excess labor or people in the wrong
posts. STEG has agreed to keep the staffing position under continuous re-
view and implement policies to improve utilization of manpower and has con-
firmed in writing their aim to employ no more than 3,200 people by 1975
despite a 50% increase in production and sales.
3.05      A further reorganization is envisaged as soon as proper statistical
and accounting information is available. The distribution function will be
decentralized to Districts, each of which will have its own budget and will
have both authority and responsibility. STEG headquarters will be responsible
for overall policy, the generating function and supplying expertise and



information. Little reliable statistical data are available from the past
and it will be two or three years before the data are available to put this
system in operation. A computer has already been installed and programmers
and statisticians engaged so that a rapid two-way flow of information, vital
for efficient management, can be introduced in the decentralized system.
STEG has agreed to continue to collect and record statistical and account-
ing information in a form which will facilitate management control of STEG's
various functions.
B. Tariffs
3.06      Tariffs, as mentioned above, were inherited from the previous
companies. The number of tariffs has, with effect from January 1, 1970,
been cut down and differences between the various companies' rates eliminated.
However, the tariffs remain basically those inherited at the inception of
ST]EG. A costing study is being undertaken by STEC with the objective of
basing tariffs on costs and STEG has agreed to implement this not later than
January 1, 1973.
C. Purchase and Transport of Gas
3.07      As mentioned in para. 2.10 natural gas is associated with the oil
being produced by SITEP. SITEP has now signed a contract ceding the gas
to the Government and the government in turn has signed a contract ceding
the gas to STEC. Both contracts are satisfactory to the Bank. The SITEP
contract provides for sale of all gas to the Government (with the exception
of gas needed by SITEP for operation of the field) for a symbolic price of
1 Dinar per million m3. Should gas be needed for reinjection in the field
for secondary recovery of oil, then the quantity and timing will be agreed
upon by the two parties.
3.08      The law of April 3, 1962 creating STEG did not specifically pro-
vide for STEG to transport natural gas. A decree modifying the law has now
been published. It is acceptable to the Bank.

4. TIJE PROJECT
A. Investment Program
4.01      STEG's investment program for capital works covers investments
for additional generating capacity at Rhennouch, additions to the existing
transmission grid and the proposed gas pipeline.
4.02      The investment program amounts to about TD 90 million during the
period 1970-1980 inclusive. Of this amount TD 7.16 million is for the pro-
posed project. Of the total of TD 90 million, TD 40 million will be raised
by loan and TD 50 million will come from internally generated funds.
Details of the investment program are shown in Table 1.
B. Description of-the Project
4.03      The project consists of facilities necessary to provide 34,000
m3 per hour (28.8 MMcf per day) of dry gas for use in the Gabes area. This
will require a gathering, compressing and treatment plant at the El Borma
oil field, and 294 km of transmission line between El Borma and Gabes.
Three sales laterals will also be constructed to supply the Rhennouch plant,
Industries Chimiques Maghrebines and Briqueterie d'El Hamma. Gas will
not be distributed for domestic or other non-industrial use.
4.04      The project includes:
(a) The procurement and installation of 4.1 km of 12-3/4
inch pipe to transport wet gas from the SITEP production
center to a compression and treatment plant;
(b) The procurement and installation of approximately 3,300 h.p.
of gas engine driven compressors including necessary
controls and ancillary facilities;
(c) The procurement and installation of facilities to treat
the gas to remove condensable gasoline fractions by
cooling it to a low temperature in contact with diethylene
glycol to remove water vapors.
(d) The procurement and installation of ancillary facilities
at the compression and treatment center, including
operating buildings and employee housing with electric,
gas, water and communication systems;
(e) The procurement and installation of 294 km of 10-3/4 inch
transmission pipeline including coating, corrosion potential
test stations, sectioning stations, scraper traps and measurement
and pressure control stations;



-7-
(f) The procurement and installation of sales laterals from the
transmission line consisting of 2.9 km of 12-3/4 inch pipe
to the Rhennouch electric generating station of STEC, 0.8 km
of 4-1/2 inch pipe to the Industries Chimique Maghrebines
plant near Gabes, and 3.7 km of 4-1/2 inch pipe to the brick
plant at El Hamma. Laterals will be coated and equipped with
corrosion potential test stations and gas pressure controls.
4.05      The location of the facilities is shown on the Map.
C.   Design and Engineering
4.06      STEG has engaged SOFREGAZ as its consultant for engineering and
for the supervision of procurement and installation of facilities. The Bank
has reviewed SOFREGAZ's design of the system and is satisfied that is tech-
nically sound. SOFREGAZ has selected the location of facilities, and drawn
up very complete and detailed specifications for the furnishing of pipe,
the construction and installation of the compression and treatment plant
and the pipelines including the gathering line, the transmission line and
sales laterals.
4.07      Tests show the wet gas to contain 12% of hydrocarbons and water
vapor which must be removed to permit transmission to market. The gathering
system and compression and treatment plant have therefore been designed to
gather and process 38,000 m3 per hour (32.2 NMcf per day) of wet
gas. While the process and performance of the plant has been specified,
the actual sizing of the equipment has been left to the firms bidding since
each manufacturer produces plant of slightly different size.
4.08      An analysis of gas transport to available markets indicates an
optimum transmission line size of 10-3/4 inch diameter (See Annex 1). This
size will permit increased capacity at minimal cost if more gas is available
an,d required. Delivery capacity is adequate and the specification c
materials and construction procedures are in accordance with good eng leering
practice and an acceptable standard of safety and are in conformity with the
applicable national code.
D.   Construction Cost Estimates
4.09      The project is estimated to cost the equivalent of US$13.6 mil-
lion (TD 7.16 million).  The proposed loans of US$10.0 million would cover
the estimated foreign exchange costs which are 73% of the total costs.
The cost estimates for various major elements of the project are shown in
the table below. Additional details are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

4.10      Of the above figures, the amount for pipe is a firm figure based
on price quoted in response to requests to bid.  Costs of remaining items,
with the exception of contingencies, are those estimated by SOFREGAZ and were
based on their recent experience in Algeria, where construction and operating
conditions are similar. An amount of approximately 6% has been included for
price escalation on local costs which is in line with local trends. A price
escalation allowance of about 10% has been applied to foreign costs to re-
flect the present trend in the contract construction cost index. These
amounts should be adequate for the relatively short construction period
proposed. Engineering investigation and planning has been done in great
detail and material and construction quantities are known within very close
limits; therefore, no allowance has been made for increases in cost due to
an increase in quantity of materials or amount of construction.
E.   Procurement
4.11      All procurement for this project will be by international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement",
except for employee living quarters and an operating headquarters building
at Gabes, which would not attract international competition.  The total
value of the contracts for such installations is not expected to exceed
US$0.5 million equivalent or about 3.6% of the project cost.
4.12      Bids for furnishing pipe have been received and are being evaluated.
Separate invitations to bid for installation of pipelines and procurement
and installation of compression and treatment facilities were sent out on
August 31, 1970 with closing date of November 25 for submission of both
tenders so that the pipeline can be completed in time for the start-up of
the Rhennouch power plant.



-9-
F. Disbursement
4.13      Disbursement of the Bank and Kuwait Fund loans will be made on
the basis of:
(a) the CIF cost of imported goods required for the Project;
(b) the foreign exchange component of the consultants contract;
and
(c) the foreign exchange cost of installation of the pipeline
and related facilities.
The amounts to be disbursed would be divided between the Bank and the
Kuwait Fund in the proportion of 75% to 25%. Disbursements are expected
to take place over a 2-1/2-year period from the first quarter 1971 to
t,he third quarter 1973. A schedule of the undisbursed quarterly payments
cf the proposed loan is shown in Table 4. Since this is a self-contained
project, any surplus loan amounts should be cancelled.
4.14      The details of the items proposed to be financed are shown in
para. 4.09 and include US$388,000 for engineering studies performed by
SOFREGAZ during 1970 which it is recommended should be financed retroactively
from the proposed loans.
CG.   Operation of the System
4.15      There is no available experienced gas operating talent in Tunisia
and it will be necessary to train personnel specially selected from STEG for
operation and maintenance of the facilities to be installed. An engineer
will receive training in making operational efficiency studies at SOFREGAZ.
T'wo design engineers, two mechanical foremen and two pipeline foremen
wvill receive training at SONATRACH, the State gas company in Algeria,
where pipelines are presently under construction and in operation; E ;plemen-
tary training will be supplied by SOFREGAZ. An operating engineer anu
six assistants will receive training on installations in service in Algeria
and in France. Arrangements for this training have been concluded between
the agencies concerned and training has already begun.
4.16      The gas system will be operated as a separate department of the
STEG production division. An organogram of the department is shown as
Annex 2. Major scheduled overhauls of the compression and treatment
facilities will be performed by outside service groups provided by the
builder. Certain other periodic maintenance work such as electric plant
overhaul will be done by personnel of STEG. The pipeline operating and
maintenance costs are shown on Table 5; they are considered adequate for
the installation proposed.

5.   ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The proposed natural gas pipeline is to supply fuel to three
users in the Gabes area: STEG's new electricity generating plants which
will use 95% of the gas, the Industries Chimiques Maghrebines chemical
plant which is presently under construction, and an existing brick plant
at El Hamma. Further details are shown in Annex 3.
5.02      Since the primary object of the proposed pipeline is to supply
gas to the new electricity generating station at Rhennouch, an economic
evaluation has been made to determine whether:
(i) STEG's investment program to expand generating
capacity is reasonable; and
(ii) the investment in the proposed pipeline ensures
that fuel to the generating station is supplied at
least cost.
B.   Justification of the STEG Investment Program
5.03      The electricity generating capacity in Tunisia increased from
133 MW in 1961 to 258 MW in 1969 due mainly to the installation of generators
at La Goulette by STEG. Consumption has kept pace with capacity and from
1961 to 1969 increased from 287 GWH to 640 GWH. This increase in electricity
consumption reflects the pattern of economic growth and industrialization,
mostly related to the growth of extractive and manufacturing industries in
the central and southern areas of the country. Despite the growth in these
areas, the northern part of Tunisia, including the area around Tunis, Nebeul,
Bizerte and Jendouba, continue to be the major area of electricity consump-
tion.
5.04      STEG expects that Tunisia's electricity consumption will increase
from 640 GWH in 1969 to between 1,040-1,116 GW11 by 1975. The projected
average annual rate of growth is about 9% for the period through 1975, as
compared to 10.4% realized during 1961-1969. The projected electricity
consumption by sector up to 1975 indicates the continuing importance of
extractive and manufacturing industries. A detailed analysis of past
national electricity generating capacity, consumption by area and sector,
and a forecast of electricity consumption by sector for the period of 1970-
75, are given in Annex 4.
5.05      These projections are based on the analysis of past trends and
the results of a market survey of the future requirements of the major
industrial consumers, including consumers operating captive generating
plants. The estimates are considered reasonable.



- 11 -
5.06      In order to serve increasing electricity demand in the country,
SIEG proposes to increase its effective capacity from 187 MW in 1970 to
303 MW in 1975 and to 531 MW by 1985. Most of the new generating capacity
will be installed at Rhennouch (see Annex 4). STEG is now constructing a
151 MW gas turbine at Menzel Bourguiba to meet the peak demand in 1971, and
two 30 MW thermal generators at Rhennouch to meet the demand from 1972 on-
waLrds. It is the Rhennouch station which will use natural gas as a fuel.
Since there is insufficient water for cooling purposes it would not be
possible to install the new station near the oil field. Without these
stations, Tunisia will have unsatisfied electricity demand which would
hamper the normal pattern of economic growth. In 1970, the present capacity,
net of reserve requirements, barely satisfies peak day demand and by
19171 there would be a capacity deficit. The deficit in terms of capacity
is shown below:
Electricity Demand and Supply, 1969-1972
(MW)
1969 /1    1970       1971     1972

Planned additional capacity  ---          ---        15        60
+11        + 2        + 8      +36
/1   Based on actual figures.
/2   Present capacity stands for effective capacity.
/3   Capacity demanded stands for maximum daily requirements plus reserve.
Given the present load factor as well as expected demand in the neal
future, the new installations are justified.  On the basis of existino
tariff schedules and estimated operating costs, the investment in the Rhen-
nouch plant would yield a rate of return of over 25%.
5.07      The location of the new generating station at Rhennouch decreases
the risk of paralysis of the power sector in case of line breaks or a
major disruption of service at La Goulette generating station.
C.   The Proposed Pipeline Project
5.08      To establish the most economic means of supplying fuels for the
new electric generators at Rlennouch and other industries in the area, two
aLlternatives were considered: (i) the use of natural gas and (ii) the use
c,f fuel oil. The major factors involved in the analysis are the demand for
fuels, the supply capacity of natural gas, comparative costs of the two
fuels, and investment costs required for the two alternatives.



- 12 -
5.09      The relevant demand for fuels consists of fuel requlrement for
the electric generating stations at Rhennouch, for the ICM chemical plant,
and for the El Hamma brick plant, the most important source of demand being
fuels for generation stations. Annual demand for fuel for the chemical
plant will reach 12 million m3 of gas by 1978; the brlck plant will require
5 million m3 per year. Total annual demand will increase from 120 million
m3 in 1973 to 288 million m3 in 1978, and continue to rise to 700 million
m3 by 1985 (see Annex 4).
5.10      Gas will be supplied to the Project from El Borma oil field (see
para 207). The field is located in the Sahara astride the Tunisia-Algeria
border, with the majority of the gas on the Tunisian side. The basic
reserve and reservoir production study of the field was prepared by the
reservoir engineering department of ACIP. The mission examined the reports
produced by AGIP and is satisfied both with the methodology and number
of cores, logs and fluid samples obtained. The approach used was conserva-
tive and the forecast of gas availability based on the data is reasonable.
Further details regarding reserves are given in Annex 5. Since the field
is an oil field, a production program was designed to maximize oil production.
Gas which is in solution with the oil is produced along with the oil
and separated at the surface. The rate of gas production is therefore
governed by the rate of oil production and the forecast of oil production
provided the basis of the forecast of gas production. The forecast of
gas availability is given in Table 6.
5.11      The annual supply of gas will decline continuously from 675 mil-
lion m3 in 1972. By 1986 the field will have reached its economic limit of
production as an oil field. This, in turn, defines the life of the project.
However, as pointed out in Annex 5, it might be possible to continue gas
operations beyond this date. Consequently, until 1978 consumption of
natural gas is limited by demand for fuels; beyond 1978, by the supply of
gas.
5.12      A comparative cost analysis of fuel oil and natural gas is shown
below:
Cost Structure of Different Fuels
(per metric ton heat equivalent of fuel oil)
Fuel Oil            US           Natural Gas             US$
CIF at Gabes            12.90         Wellhead Cost              0
Storage and Handling                  Pipeline Operating
Costs                0.38             Cost               1.15
Pipeline Depreciation 5.45
13.28                                6.60
The comparative cost figures indicate that the cost of gas is about one-half
the cost of fuel oil. This difference in fuel costs is the source of
economic benefits in the form of cost savings in the fuel use.



- 13 -
5.13      The economic cost of the pipeline project is estimated at TD 7.2
mtillion or US$13.6 million equivalent, which is equal to the estimated in-
vestment cost (see para 4.09) since no taxes are payable on import of
materials or equipment. The foreign exchange costs would amount to US$10.0
vmillion equivalent or 73% of the total cost (see para. 4.09). Although
STEG's generating plants at Rhennouch will rely almost entirely on natural
gas as fuel until 1979, the declining supply of natural gas, combined
with the growing needs for fuel for electricity, will necessitate a substan-
tial use of fuel oil from 1981 onward. The use of fuel oil will require
investments for storage and pumping facilities which would occur much
earlier without the proposed pipeline project.
5.14      On the most conservative basis the difference in the cost and
benefit streams of the proposed pipeline and the next best alternative, the
use of fuel oil, is reduced to zero at a discount rate of 10.6% (see Annex
6). Since this rate is in excess of the opportunity cost of capital in
Tunisia, the proposed project is the least cost solution for the supply of
fuel to the electric power plant which is estimated to have a rate of return
well in excess of 25%.
5.15      The estimated discount rate is sensitive to changes in the costs
of fuel oil, which are rising. For example, an increase of 10% in the cost
of fuel oil will raise the rate by 2%. Should gas continue to be available
irom the field for a further three years (see para. 5.11), then the estimated
rate would be 12%.
5.16      The estimated discount rate of 10.6% is conservative, both
with respect to fuel costs and availability of gas, and is considered
to be a minimum. The most probable rate is 12%.

6. FINANCES
A.   Introduction
6.01      STEG is a public company wholly owned by the Government, but has
no issued share capital. The equivalent to equity is the excess of assets
over liabilities. As of December 31, 1969 this balance stood at TD 37.9
million.
6.02      Prior to 1969, STEG did not maintain an adequate accounting
system and this is one of the many problems the present management has had
to face (paras. 3.03 and 3.04). In 1969 STEG retained Peat, Marwick,
Mitchell and Company as auditors and also made arrangements for a senior
accountant from Electricite de France to be seconded to them. The auditors
first report is dated July 15, 1970 (see para. 6.09). Their report includes
a balance sheet as of December 31, 1969, and details of the changes which
they gave effect to in the balance sheet. The balance sheet and the
accompanying statement of profit and loss were used as the starting point
for this report. The changes made with respect to earlier accounts were
of such magnitude that prior years' financial data were of little use.
Further changes may occur in the 1970 accounts as a result of the continuing
audit, since the physical count and valuation of the assets are not yet
complete.
B.   Revenues and Expenses
6.03      The Profit and Loss Account projections, which are shown in
Table 7 and summarized below, show an improvement in operating surplus
over the period 1970-80.
TD millions
1969     1970      1971     1972       1973        1980

Expenses               6.386    5.578    6.472    6.855       6.608    10.373
Operating Surplus      4.799    5.978    5.843    6.350        7.465    10.798

Interest                .913    1.028    1.175    1.275       1.623      1.738
Net Profit              .169    1.114    0.528    0.337       0.883      2.137

In the early years, however, this is offset by the increasing cost of
depreciation and interest and it is only in the years from 1973 onwards
that net profit increases to a reasonable level. Since demand for elec-
tricity is not in doubt, and given the determination of the management to
control operating expenses, the projections are realistic. Assumptions
used in the projections are shown in Annex 7.



- 15 -
6.04      No allowance has been made for changes or increases in tariffs,
which might improve income still further, since any change must await the
outcome of the tariff study (see para. 3.06).
6.05      Provision for depreciation is calculated on the straight line
basis. The proposed pipeline is charged to operations over its estimated
useful life of 15 years. Most of the remainder of the fixed assets are
depreciated at the rate of 5% per year. The provision for depreciation is
higher than that practiced in most electricity companies. As the company
follows the policy of commencing the provision for depreciation in the
year of acquisition, the net profits after depreciation tend to fall
in the years of heavy purchases of capital assets.
6.06      The return on average net fixed assets, which is shown in Table 9,
rises from 2.0% in 1969 to 4.5% in 1980. STEC follows the policy of show-
ing newly acquired capital assets as working assets in the year of acquisi-
tion. This, combined with the depreciation policy mentioned in para. 6.05
has the effect of depressing the return. The notional return on fixed
assets in use (Table 9) based on normal depreciation rates as used by power
companies averages over 7.5% during the period. A more easily measured
ratio is the operating surplus/net fixed assets ratio which is not signifi-
cantly affected by changes in depreciation policies. This ratio (Table 9)
in the period after construction of the power plant and pipeline improves
from 10.3% to 12.7% by 1980. STEG has agreed to control expenses and
tariffs so that the ratio from 1973 onwards does not fall below 10%.
6.07      STEG is not subject to income taxes.
6.08      The operating expenses of the proposed pipeline are included in
STEG's projected statement of profit and loss under a separate caption.
Tlhese operating expenses do not include the provision for depreciation of
tlhe pipeline which is included in the overall depreciation provision for
the company or the cost of financing its construction. The detailed pro-
jection of all costs for the pipeline are set out in Table 6. STEG hlaS
agreed to maintain separate departmental accounts for the pipeline project.
C.   Cash Flow
6.09      The precarious financial balance of STEG as projected at the time
of appraisal is illustrated by the projected cash flow, details of which
are shown in Table 10. In two years, 1971 and 1972, it resulted in a nega-
tive (overdraft) position of TD 863,000 and TD 345,000, respectively. There
were various ways of dealing with this--the ideal method being the injection
of equity by the Government. The question was discussed during negotiations
and the Government agreed to two measures which together are acceptable to
the Bank. They are:
(a) Exemption from import duties and taxes on goods imported
for the construction of the pipeline and the Rhennouch
power station, under the provisions of the law encouraging
investment in the southern region.



- 16 -
(b) The procurement of overdraft facilities for STEG from
local banks of not less than one million dinars.
6.10      These measures, combined with an increase in customers contribu-
tion to the cost of installation of branch lines, which has now been recal-
culated, adequately safeguard STEG's liquidity position. The effect of
exemption from duties and the increase in customers contribution is to in-
ject a TD's 1,700,000, TD's, 900,000 in 1971 and TD's 800,000 in 1972, thus
eliminating the negative cash position in both years. The effect of this
injection of further funds is shown at the bottom of Table 10. The Govern-
ment has further agreed to make available such funds as may be necessary
to ensure that STEG has at all times adequate cash balances.
D.   Balance Sheets
6.11      The balance sheet drawn up by the auditors at December 31, 1969
(see para. 6.02) together with the projections through 1980 are shown in
Table 8 and summarized below:
TD millions
1969     1970    1971    1972   1973    1980
Current Assets                 11.7      9.4      8.3     9.5   11.0    15.2
Net Fixed Assets              54.8      54.8    60.6    71.5   71.4    84.4
Long Term Inventory             5.0      7.6    11.0      4.4    4.7      7.3
Other Assets                   1.4       1.3      1.3     1.3    1.3      1.3
Total                    72.9      73.1    81.2    86.7   88.4   108.2
Current Liabilities            9.5       5.9      5.8     6.7    6.9      8.5
Other Liabilities               5.0      5.8      7.0     8.2    9.1    16.1
Long-term Debt                 20.5     22.4    28.8    31.9   31.6    29.7
Equity                        37.9      39.0    39.6    39.9   40,8    53.9
Total                    72.9      73.1    81.2    86.7   88.4   108.2
6.12      Over the period, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities
improves indicating the efficacy of the measures agreed upon during negoti-
ations (see para. 6.09). The cost of fixed assets rises from TD 75 million
in 1969 to TD 165 million in 1980. The book value of these assets increases
during the same period from TD 55 million to TD 85 million, an increase of

6.13      The debt equity ratio which is 35:65 in 1969 rises to 44:56 in
1972, as a result of loans for construction of the generating station at
Rhennouch and the pipeline. By 1980 it has fallen to 36:64 as a result of
increase in retained earnings. Details of the ratios are shown in Table
9. STEG has agreed not to incur debt which would raise the debt equity
ratio above 45:55 without permission of the Bank and Kuwait Fund. Of the
total cost of fixed assets amounting to TD 110 million, when the pipeline
project is completed, less than 7% will have been provided by the proposed
Bank and Kuwait Fund loan.
E.   Financing the Project
6.14      As mentioned in para 4.02, the project is estimated to cost
TI) 7.16 million (US$13.65 million). The foreign exchange component of
TI) 5.25 million (US$10 million equivalent) is proposed to be financed by
loans from the Bank and the Kuwait Fund. The local currency component of
TD 1.91 million (US$3.65 million) will come from STEG's internally generated
ftnds as shown below:

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following prin-
cipal points:
(a) STEG will implement policies to improve utilization of mAnpOwer
(Paragraph 3.04)
(b) STEG will collect and record data for management control
(Paragraph 3.05)
(c) STEG will maintain a ratio of operating surplus to net fixed
assets of not less than 10% (Paragraph 6.06) and a debt equity.
ratio of not more than 45:55 (Paragraph 6.13)
(d) The Government will exempt STEG from import duties and taxes
on goods imported for the pipeline and power station (Para-
graph 6.09)
(e) The Government will provide STEG with overdraft facilities.
7.02      Contracts satisfactory to the Bank, ceding gas from STEG to the
Government and from the Government to STEG, have been entered into (Para-
graph 3.07).
7.03      A decree satisfactory to the Bank enabling STEG to transmit
natural gas has been published. (Paragraph 3.08).
7.04      It is recommended that the costs of engineering studies amounting
to approximately US$0.388 million be financed retroactively from the pro-
posed loans.
7.05      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$7.5 million for a term of 16 years including a grace period of three
years.

EL BORMA-GABES GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
Considerations Determining Line Diameter
1.        A number of feasibility studies of possible gas markets and
systems to serve them were investigated in arriving at the selection of
the proposed project. The gas demand projections could be fairly well
matched by the capacity of either 8-5/8 inch or 10-3/4 inch pipelines. The
8-5/8 inch svstem would operate at its maximum allowable pressure of 1,260
ps:L and hence its maximum capacity from 1976 through 1980. However,
during 1978 and 1979 gas demand and availability would exceed the capacity
of an 8-5/8 inch pipeline. A 10-3/4 inch line operating at a pressure of
878 psi would transport the available gas during 1978 and 1979. While
the capital cost of the 10-3/4 inch line would be greater than the 8-5/8
inch line, the higher operating pressure of the 8-5/8 inch line would require
more compressor horsepower than the 10-3/4 inch line with attendant higher
operating cost. The benefits derived by transmitting more gas which will
replace fuel oil together with the lower operating costs of the 10-3/4 inch
line more than offset the slightly higher capital cost of this solution
compared with the 8-5/8 inch line and result in a higher rate of return for
the 10-3/4 inch line. Furthermore the 10-3/4 inch line gives flexibility
if greater quantities of gas than foreseen become available.

EL BORMA-GABES GAS PIPETINE PROJECT
Demand for Natural Gas
A.   Introduction
1.        Three plants in the Gabes area will consume natural gas from
the proposed pineline:
i)   STEC
ii)   Industries Chimiques Maghrehines
iii)   Briqueterie d'El Hamma
The total natural gas consumption of these plants is shown on Page 4.
B.   STEG
2.        STEG has designed its generating facilities at Rhennouch with
dual burners to use either natural gas or fuel oil as a source of energy.
Natural gas will be used to the extent of demand for fuel for electricity
production, limited by the supply of gas from El Borma. Fuel oil will
supply remaining energy requirements.
3.        The demand for fuel varies directly with the demand for elec-
tricity which shows marked hourly, daily, and seasonal fluctuation. To
ensure reasonably stable demand for gas, STEG will provide its Rhennouch
generating facilities with a high base load. From 1973 to 1977, the
Rhennouch plants will operate at apnroximately an 80% load factor entirely
on natural gas. During off peak hours of demand, Rhennouch will supply a
large part of STEG's tqtal load. Although Rhennouch will continue to
operate at a high load factor beyond 1977, natural gas will supply a
steadily diminishing portion of total fuel requirements.

peak in 1978 at 271 x 106m3 of gas and because of declining gas reserves,
will continue to fall beyond 1978. Over the life of the project, STEG
will account for 90% of total gas throughput of the pipeline.

5.        ICM, a factory now being built at Gabes for the manufacture of
phosphoric acid, and scheduled to be completed in 1971, will also consume
natural gas as a fuel. The plant process involves the production of
sulphuric acid from sulphur and, consequently, the action of sulphuric
acid on phosphates to produce phosphoric acid. The energy released by
the combustion of sulphur will be insufficient to meet the needs of the
plant and increasing quantities of outside fuels will be required as
production increases there.
6.        The fuel requirements of ICM have been converted to natural
gas quantities and the annual consumption will amount to 5 x 106m3 of
natural gas in 1972, rising to 10 x 106m3 in 1973, 11 x 106m3 in 1976,
anad reaching a level of 12 x 106m3 per year by 1978.

7.        This brick plant is situated 30 kilometers west of Gabes and
would be served by the proposed pipeline on its route to Gabes. The
capacity of the plant at the end of 1969 was 80,000 tons per year. The
natural gas3requirements of the plant have been conservatively estimated
at 5 x 106m per year, beginning in 1973.

Demand and Supply of Electricity
A.   1961-1969
1.        The consumption of electricity in Tunisia rose from 287 GWH
in 1961 to 640 GWI in 1969, an average annual growth rate at 10.4%.
STEG supplied 83% of total consumption in 1969 with captive generating
plants supplying the remainder. The past consumption of electricity in
T'unisia is described in Table on Page 4.
2.        In 1969, the manufacturing industry accounted for 41% of STEG's
sales of electricity and was its most important consumer sector. The
domestic sector was next in importance with 17% of sales, followed by the
etxtractive industry with 14%. Other important sectors, in declining order
of importance, were services, motor power, public lighting, and transpor-
tation and communication. The extractive, manufacturing and services
industries were the fastest growing consumers of electricity. These
changes are indicated in the table below:

3.        Since 1961, there has been some change in the regional struc-
ture of STEG's sales of electricity (see Table below). The northern
part of Tunisia, including the areas around Tunis, Nabeur, Bizerte and
Jendouba continues to consume the major part of STEG's output but its
percent of total sales fell from 86.3% in 1961 to 68.8% in 1969. The
central part of Tunisia now accounts for 17.2% of STEG's sales, compared



ANNEX 4
Page 2
to 5.7% in 1961 and the southern area now comprises 14.0% versus 8.0% in
1961. The south and central areas of the country accounted for the
fastest growth in sales of electricity over the past decade. Much of
this growth can be attributed to the expanding energy requirements of
Tunisia's extractive industries which are concentrated in the southern
part of the country and which now form the third largest consumer sector
for electricity.

4.         The installed electric generating capacity increased from 133 MW
in 1961 to 258 MW in 1969 due mainly to the installation of new thermal
stations at La Goulette totaling 110 MW. STEG capacity comprises 83% of
the total capacity; captive plants accounts for the remainder (see
Table on Page 5). Gross production of electricity by STEG grew from
282.3 GWH in 1961 to 624.4 GWH in 1969. Transmission losses, as a
percent of gross production, were 14.8% in 1961 and 14.7% in 1969.
B.   1970-1975
5.         STEG has used two approaches to estimate the future national
demand for electricity. In the first method, it used 1958-1968 historical
consumption data to obtain arithmetic parameters for a regression model.
This model was then used to estimate yearly median and upper and lower
range limits for the future Tunisian demand for electricity. Four
different calculations were made, based on different assumptions regarding
consumption in the base year, 1969, which was adversely affected by
floods in the latter part of the year. The second method involved surveys
of the major consumers of electricity within each sector of activity.
Based on these survey results and on historical data, forecasted demand
schedules were derived for each consumer sector. The results obtained
from the two methods were compared, and probable consumption ranges were
estimated as shown below:



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Future Consumption of Electricity
(GWH)
1970                              690-710
1971                              750-780
1972                              830-870
1973                              900-950
1974                              960-1020
1975                             1040-1110
These consumption ranges were then changed to gross production figures
by using a transmission loss factor of 12 to 14%. STEG production
estimates were calculated by deducting from the aggregate Tunisian
production figures the expected production of captive plants, estimates
o:E which were obtained in surveys of those plants.
6.        Depending on the forecasting method used, STEG estimates that
Tunisian consumption of electricity in 1975 will range from 1040 GWR to
1110 GWH, indicating an average annual growth from 1969 of 8.4% to 9.6%.
During this period, the extractive industry, and the pumping and tourism
sectors should increase their respective proportions of total consumption.
The manufacturing industry is expected to maintain its relative position
while domestic and public usage of electricity will grow at a rate less
than the overall average. The table on Page 6 shows a forecasted break-
down of consumption by sector. The share of national consumption of
electricity supplied by captive generating plants should decrease slightly
during the period 1969 to 1975 (16.7% in 1969, 16.0% in 1975).
7.        STEG has assumed the lower anticipated annual rate of growth
in national electricity consumption 8.4%, to project its own production
to 1975. If the average growth rate does reach 9.6%, however, STEG will
have sufficient generating capacity above reserve requirements to provide
the higher peak day demands. Beyond 1975, STEG has projected a slow^-
rate of growth in production reaching an annual growth rate of 7.5% by
1985. STEG production in 1985 should reach 2140 GWH, indicating an annual
growth rate from 1969 of 8.0%. STEG's maximum day demand of electricity
will reach 194 MW in 1975 and 382 MW in 1985.  STEG's equipment program
will provide a security reserve over these peak demands ranging from a
low of 21.1% to a high of 31.9% during the period 1970 to 1985 and
averaging 26' over the whole period.  The Table on Page 7 indicates
STEG's forecasted electricity demand and its capital investment program.

ANNEX 5
TJNISIA
SOCIETE TUNISIENNE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
Gas Reserves
Gas will be supplied to the project from the El Borma oil
field. The field is located in the Sahara astride the Tunisia-Algeria
border. The majority of the gas will come from horizons which do not
extend into Algeria. The field was discovered in 1964, with first pro-
duction in 1966 on completion of an oil pipeline to Skhirra on the Gulf
of Gabes. At that time there were about 18 producing wells in the field.
Drilling continued the development of the field with full development being
attained with 40 producing wells completed in mid-1970. In total 44
wells have been drilled, four of which are not suitable for production.
The initial report on oil and gas reserves and deliverability was dated
12 March 1968 at which time there were 28 completed wells in the field.
As of the end of 1969 there were 40 producing wells and 4 non-producing.
The additional wells drilled between March 1968 and the end of 1969
along with some production experience provided better data on the nature
of the reservoirs and the extent of the field and the study was revised
by the ACIP reservoir engineering group in Milan.  This revised study of
oil and gas reserves and production has been used as the basis for the
projections of gas availability which were provided to STEG.
2.        The mechanics of production of a porous reservoir containing
water, oil and gas are very complex and it is essential that a large
eamount of detailed reservoir rock and fluid data be analyzed as a basis
for predictions of reserves and production. Predictions should be inter-
preted with caution and conservatism. In the present instance, the
production forecast was based on very complete data, the number of cores,
logs and fluid samples obtained being greater than usually taken. The
analysis of the data and forecast of production thus provided have been
rade by competent reservoir engineers by methods customarily used by
the industry.
3.        The reservoir rock and fluid characteristics obtained from
samples were used to compute reserves in place and producible and the
productivity of wells from each of six producing zones present in the
reservoir. The zones are lettered in descending order A, B, C, D, E and
IF, and vary in their areal extent. The A zone is the uppermost. The
A zone is the only one containing a gas cap. Gas cap production is not
included as part of the available gas since it will only be produced at
the end of the economic life of the field (after 1986). The data
obtained from drilling and production between March 1968 and the last
quarter of 1969 were used to revise the March 1968 estimates. The
reservoir data and performance forecasts were made by the same procedures
as previously.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
4.        Initially it was assumed that there was an effective water
drive as the producing mechanism; however, production data now shows
this is not the case. Original produced Gas/Oil ratio was 182 to 200
Nm3 of gas/m3 oil. (1024 to 1125 cubic ft per barrel of oil). This has
been increasing steadily and is presently above 250 Nm3 gas/r3. This
indicates a drop in reservoir pressure due to the oil production rate
from the reservoir being greater than the water encroachment rate into
the edges of the reservoir. The drop in pressure causes release of gas
from the oil. Oil production by dissolved gas drive is not as effective
as by water drive hence total oil recovery would be less than forecast.
Maintenance of a G/O ratio of 200 can be accomplished by injecting
extraneously produced water at the outer edges of the oil zones. SITEP
is about to make studies of water injection schemes. An ample supply
of suitable water is reported to be available at a depth of 800 meters
which eliminates the major technical obstacle to the scheme, and it is
then a question of the economics of water injection costs versus value
of extra oil produced. The quantity of gas produced will be greater if
water is not injected; however, there is more gas available than can be
used whether or not water is injected during the first half of the operat-
ing life of the gas pipeline.  If water is not injected, there will be
some increase in pipeline throughput during the latter half of the operat-
ing life of the line and the economic viability of the line will be
improved in a small degree over that forecast. It is generally profitable
to inject water into oil reservoirs and it is quite likely that it will
be done at El Borma. The production schedule used as a basis for the
present feasibility study assumes a water drive.
5.        The production schedule also assumes the abrupt cessation of
oil and gas from the oil zones at the end of 1986. This is somewhat
unrealistic. The field will be at the stripper stage thereafter and
uneconomic purely as a large scale oil operation. STEG could continue
the oil operation while producing gas from the gas cap in the A zone. It
could be conservatively estimated that gas cap production plus oil
associated gas production would amount to 250 x 106m3 in 1987, 200 x 106m3
in 1988 and 150 x 106m3 in 1989.
6.        The dry (treated) pipeline gas will be free of sulfur with the
chemical composition shown below.

ANNEX 6
TUNISIA
APPRAISAL OF SOCIETE TUNISIENNE DE L'ELECTRICITE ET DU GAZ
EL BORMA - GABES GAS PIPELINE PROJECT
Assumptions Used For Rate of Return Calculations
1.        The table in this Annex shows the calculation of the most likely
rate of return on the proposed project. Economic benefits in the form of
cost savings are generated by the use of natural gas as a source of
thermal energy rather than alternative fuels, particularly fuel oil, at
the Rhennouch power generating station, the ICM chemical plant and the El
Hamma brick factory.
2.        The benefits accruing to this project must be stated in terms
of the economic costs of alternative fuels at the burners in Gabes. The
present C.I.F. price of fuel oil at Gabes is estimated at D6.8 per metric
ton or US $12.90 equivalent. This is the current price of fuel oil
supplied by the STIR refinery to STEG for its other generating plants and
this price corresponds to the C.I.F. price of imported fuel oil dockside
in Bizerta. The economic cost to handle and store this fuel oil, from
the dockside to the burners is estimated at US$.38 per ton. Total econ-
omic cost of the fuel oil at the point of use is $13.28 per ton, equiva-
lent in effective heating value to 1,000 m3 of natural gas at $13.60.
Tax elements are considered as transfer payments and have therefore been
eliminated in these calculations.
3.        The economic cost of natural gas includes the cost of preparing
the natural gas for pipeline transmission and the cost of operating the
pipeline. The natural gas at El Borma is now being flared, and with no
other apparent economic use, its economic cost at the wellhead is taken
as zero.
4.        The proposed project postpones the need for investments in fuel
oil storage and pumping facilities by STEG, which would otherwise be
required in 1972 and 1975. The difference in investment costs for the
lpipeline project compared to the immediate use of fuel oil, is included
in the Annex Table.
5.        Based on the economic cost of fuel oil, the projected sales
(Annex 3) and the estimated economic costs of the project, the rate of
return has been calculated for the economic life of the project, 1972 to
1986.  The minimum rate of return is 10.6%.  This return would increase
if the demand for gas prior to 1979 exceeds the levels forecasted if the
supply of gas available beyond 1978 exceeds expectations, or if the cost
of fuel oil rises. The most probable rate of return is 12%.
