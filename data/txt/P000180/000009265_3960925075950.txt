PROJECT COMPLETION PEPORT
BURUNDI
RIRIMIRO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1165-BU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Repcrt (PCR) for the Kirimiro Rural
Development Project for which Credit 1165-BU in the amount of US$19.3 million was
approved on June 16, 1981. Credit 1165-BU was closed fully disbursed on June 30,
1988, a year behind schedule; the last disbursement was on September 6, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division of the South-
Central and Indian Ocean Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and
III). On May 17, 1991 the Association sent the Borrowzer Parts I and III with the
request to prepare Part II by August 17, 1991; no response was received.
Preparation of this PCR is based inter alia on the Staff Aprraisal Report,
the Credit Agreement, Supervision Reports, correspondence between the IDA and the
Borrower, and internal memoranda.

BURUNDI
KIRIMIRO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1165-BU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Agriculture is the major economic activity in Burundi and generat6s almost
all foreign exchange, 90 percent of which is accounted for by coffee.  Food-
stuffs make up a little less than 10 percent of imports. Impoverished soils and
a degraded environment constitute a considerable threat to the agricultural
potential of the country, 90 percent of whose population lives from farming in
circumstances where population density exceeds 190 inhabitants per km2.  The
project was located in Burundi's most aensely populatel region and in its main
coffee growing area.
2.    The project, to be implemented over a period of s4.x .-vars, was estimated
to cost SDR 18.0 million.  IDA would finance SDR 16.2 millo-. o^nd Government SDR
1.8 million. Because the project was to be managed accorAing to annual work
plans, 96 percent of the funding in the Credit was unallocated.
Obiectives
3.    The  project  aimed  at:    (a) assisting  smallholders  to  improve  the
productivity of their holdings, and thereby increase their food consumption and
income, through the provision of inputs, the strengthening of extension services
and the implementation of appropriate erosion control measures; (b) improving
rural living conditione by building ot maintaining water sources, equipping
social centers and developing wood resources to be used as fuelwood, building
poles and timber; and (c) improving the quality of Burundi coffee by building
washing stations. The project signaled a change from the Government's previous
agricultural  development  strategy.    Instead  of  centralized  governmental
departments being used to develop coffee production, Regional Development
Companies (RDCs) were to be created as decentralized agencies, to be m&. !j
responsible  for  the  integrated  development  of  their  respective  regiouc.
(foodcrops, coffee, infrastructure, erosion control). One RDC was therefore set
up under this project to carry out the activities that had previously been the
responsibility of separate departments.
Implementation Experience
4.    The project was well executed, thanks to a stable, competent management
taam.



- iv -
5.    The extension service was not very effective during the initial phase of
implementation.   Starting in 1987, however, increasing use was made of the
Training and Visit method and both performance and impact of the extension
service have improved substantially since.
Results
6.    As a result of project activities, foodcrop production of major crops in
the Kirimiro region continued to increase, and rice and vegetables, and the use
of fertilizer were introduced. The project does not appear to have succeeded in
reducing soil erosion and degradation, despite the introduction of several
measures (like afforestation on hilltops and agroforestry in coffee plantations
and use of fertilizers.
7.    In coffee-growing, the project resulted in the planting of thirty times
more trees than anticipated. Although the total number of productive trees is
not known accurately, coffee yields are declining in the project area because of
failure to fertilize adequately, faulty pruning, aging of trees, and the location
of new plantations in marginal areas. Washing station building programs exceeded
appraisal estimates and have enabled Burundi to achieve a considerable increase
in the volume of fully washed coffee, which is of the high quality anticipated
at appraisal.
8.    In reforestation and road building, goals were also exceeded, mainly due
to active community participation. The number of water supply points developed
by the project was higher than had been anticipated (1,372 actual vs. 180 at
appraisal).
9.    The project was successful in raising farm incomes.  A survey of 135 farms
in the Kirimiro region in 1987-88 (three cropping seasons), six years after
commencement of the project, showed cash income from sales to be an estimated FBu
19,570 per household, or FBu 13,890 at 1981 prices.   At appraisal,  it was
anticipated that 10 years after project commencement a farm would have cash
income from sales of FBu 10,980 (at 1981 prices).
10.   The economic rate of return for the project is reestimated at 16.5 percent
(18 percent predicted at appraisal). The similarity between the rates of return
can primarily be explained by project management's effectiveness in reducing
investments on unproductive activities and increasing investments in successful
activities, which is fully explained by an attitude of flexibility and adjuesment
during implementation.
Sustainabilitv
11.   Toward the end of the project, following a study of the operation of the
RDCs, it appeared that, owing to the difficulties inherent in managing numercus
inter-related action programs (with differing orientations:   services versus
commercial operations), the institutional sustainability of the project could not
be assured. As a result, it was decided to discontinue the RDC experiment and
to divide the activities in question betweer. the public sector (extension,
research, infrastructure) and the private sector (washing-station management,



-v -
marketing of inputs, seed multiplication and plant propagation). The future role
of the 'IDCs will be to coordinate these actions within their own regions.
Findines and Lesso-.s 1 arned
12.   Important lessoie were as follows:
(a)  Hanaging  he project according to annual work plans made it possible
to adjust ooth activities, budgets and Credit category disbursements
in the light of constraints and successes met with during the
execution process itself. More coffee washing stations could thus
be built and the orprating costs could easily be adjusted in light
of the activities of the extension service.
(b)   Emphasis by the extension service on agents to cooperate with local
communities on a participatory basis and to endeavor to ascertain
their most urgent needs, has laid the groundwork for more active
private sector involvement in the follow-up projects (Coffee Sector
Project and Agricultural Services Project).
(c)   The lack of research-extension interaction limited the effectiveness
of the extension services.   No messages could be developed that
addressed basic farmer needs and that could have been instrumental
i combatting plant diseases and erosion.
(d)   P -ject management teams should ensure that the terms of reference
foL the technical assistance clearly define not only technical
dutie, but also training responsibilities, especially towards the
end of the contractual period.

KIRIMIRO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Identity of the Project
Project name : Kirimiro Rural Development Project
Credit number: 1165-BU
RVP Unit      : Africa Regional Office
Country       : Burundi
Sector        : Agriculture
Subsector    : Area Development
2.    Backtround
2.1   Agriculture is the major economic activity in Burundi.  Over 90 percent of
Burundians derive their livelihood from it, working approximately one million
farms averaging less than one hectare in size. It accounts for approximately 62
percent of GDP and generates almost all foreign exclbange, 90 percent of which is
accounted for by coffee. Nevertheless, food imports make up about 10 percent of
all imports, indicating the presence of a chronic food production deficit.
2.2   The Government's third Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan
(1978-82) had as its main agricultural sector objectives: soil protection, food
self-sufficiency, import substitution (wheat, sugar, tobacco, wood), expansion
and diversification of exports (quinine, fruits and vegetables), development of
livestock and fishing, arresting deforestation, and increasing the return on
existing investments. To achieve these objectives, the Government encouraged the
creation of cooperatives and established Regional Development Companies (RDC).
The RDCs were intended to take on responsibility for all rural development
activities, financed either by the Government itself or from the proceeds of
external loans. The RDCs were organized as autonomous parastatals, and were
expected to become self-financing. This project involved one of the first RDCs.
3.    Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.1   Objectives.  The project aimed at:  (a) assisting smallholders to improve
the productivity of their holdings, and thereby increase their food consumption
and income, through the provision of inputs, the strengthening of extension
services and the implementation of appropriate erosion control measures;
(b) improving rural living conditions by building or maintaining water sources,
equipping social centers and developing wood resources to be used as fuelwood,
building poles and timber; and (c) improving the quality of Burundi coffee by
building washing stations.



-2-
3.2   Description.  The Froject, which was to be implemented over a period of six
years on the basis of annual work programs, had the following components:
-    a program to provide extension services and agricultu'ral inputs for
the development of coffee and foodcrop production;
-     the contruction of six coffee washing stations and twelve hand
pulping centers, and improvement of the operation and maintenance of
all hand-palping centers;
-     afforestation and erosion control;
-     a selec ive improvement of the rural road network, including the
rehabilitation of bridges;
-    the improvement of rural water supplies;
-    pilot activities to promote agricultural production and improve the
living conditions of the rural population;
-     studies, research and project monitoring;
-     staff training; and
-    the establishment of a Regional Development Company (RDC), including
the provision of technical assistance for project implementation.
4.    Proiect Desirn and Organization
4.1   The underlying concept was to establish an RDC in the region to carry out
the Government's policy of integrated and decentralized rural development.
Preparation work on the project was commissioned to SOMEBU (Soci6t6 mixte d'6tude
du Burundi, a Burundi consulting agency), with the resulting studies to be
revie;ed by the various ministries involved. The Bank's Nairobi office assisted
SOMEBO in general matters and in its discussions with the Government on the
studies, as they progressed.  This phase of preparation by a Burundian team,
punctuated by exchanges of views with the Bank, meant that the goals of the
projeca and the resources t!e" would make use of were well understood by the
interes-ed parties 1/.
4.2   The RDC was given p.  3:y responsibilit, ;or project implementation under
the general supervision -. the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL).
Research activities were to be carried out by the Burundi Institute of
Agricultural Science (ISABU). The staff employed by MAL in the project area was
absorbed by the RDC. The project was implemented on the basis of annual work
programs, prepared by the RDC, reviewed by its Board of Directors and MAL and
submitted to IDA for approval.
I/    The preparation work for this project was jointly carried out with the
preparation work for the concurrent Ngozi II Integrated Rural Development
Project, which is the subject of a separate PCR.



- 3 -
4.3   For Burvndi, the project was innovative, in the sense that the approach to
agricultural development was new in various ways: (a) the emphasis wac placed
on crop diversification, and inclueion of both environmental (rsforestation,
erosion control) and social elements (wazer cupply); and (b) a new administrative
structure was created by eliminating the centralized vertical type of organiza-
tion and replacing it with an autonomous regional en.ity, the RDC.
4.4   The project was well prepared, given the objectives and the strategy
chosen. Elements that contributed to the smooth execution of the project were:
(a) to have the project management team and IDA agree on annual work plans, which
allowed flexibility in responding to newly identified needs (uneer the terms of
the Credit Agreement, 96 percent of proceeds we    -allocated); and (b) to
interest the private sector (farmer associations, c-,   atiaves, traders) in plant
propagation (100 percent of coffee and forest plants)  :.d marketing of inputs
(roughly  20 percent  sold  through  cooperatives  and private  agents).    In
retrospect, however, not enough precautions had been taken to address the
potential risks that the design team had identified at the tinm of appraisal.
These risks were: (a) the difficulty in ovetcoming the complexity of the project
(the number of components and the type of technical messages to be extended--most
of which were new not only to farmers but also to extension agents); and (b) full
integration of the various "horizontal" services--extension, erosion control,
washing station management, building of infrastructure, etc. --within a relatively
short time period (five years), against the background of an overall objective
which called for RDCs to be run like corporations and not like branches of a
public service agency.
5.    Project ImRlementation
A. General
5.1   Credit Effectiveness.  The project was declared effective on June 2, 1982,
a delay of three months caused by bureaucratic tardiness in meeting the
conditions of effectiveness (obtaining the :_gal opinion and publishing the
Credit Agreement in the official gazette).
5.2   Im21ementation Schedule.  Primarily as a result of efrectiveness delays,
closure of the cre.t was postponed by 12 months.
5.3   Project Costs.  Project costs were higher than expected, because ofs  (a)
an increase in the  .ea served by the extension services; (b) construction of
23 additional coffeL washing stations; (c) financing of a greatly expanded rural
infrastructure program; and (d) higher distribution of coffee seedlings and low
seed station efficiency.  The increase in projert costs of the Kirimiro Project
were financed in part by Government and in part by cross-financing from the Ngozi
III Credit (Cr. 1192-BU) in the amount of SDR 2.0 million.
5.4   Disbursements.  The estimated and actual disbursements for the project are
given in Table 3.C of Part III. The credit was fully disbursed by June 1988 and
the last disburs.ament was on September 6, 1988.
5.5 Changes in Project Desian. The main changes in project design were: (a)
an increase in the number of coffee washing stations from 6 to 29;   (b) an



-4-
increase in the nvmber of communes targeted for extension serviceq from 7 to 24
in 1987; and (c) addition of a component to encourage wider interest in livesto_k.i
activities (higher incomes, source of manure).
B. Extension
5.6   Foodoroge.  The major technical messages dissem.inated through the project
were: widespread use of improved seed; planting of banana trees under better
conditions (construction of contour embankments and planting of protective
grasses such as setaria or tripsacoma); and use of fortilizero and pesticides.
Because of poor organization and agent treining, the extension service did not
prove very effective during the early years of the project; the Training and
Visit method vas therefore introduced in 1987.  A shb.,c.age of subject matter
specialists still persists in the project area.   Extension did succeed in
lncreasing fertilizer use and erosion control where foodcrops are concerned. The
extension system was backed up by seed multiplication plots initially managed by
the RDC but subsequently more and more by farmers themselves with RDC assistance,
the aim being to lower the cost of seed and involve farmers more closely. The
value of these plots was limited, however, as varieties grown were not of much
interest to farmers, or gave mediocre yields because of disease, poor choices for
plot locations, and poor or absent linkage with the research apparatus.
Production of quality seeds is still less than demand. In addition, research is
poorly integrated with extension programs.
5.7   Coffee-aroinAt.  The technical messages for coffee growing focussed on the
propagation and distribution of seedlings, mulching, fertilizing, pruning, and
pest control. f
C. Coffee Washina Stations
5.8   The washing stations used a floating reception method which should have
provided for good grading, however, faults in the design and actual construction
have been found that will have to be repaired. The waste waters created by the
washing process do not create pollution. Several tests were done and all were
negative. The washing stations needed five years to reach capacity output (since
this was a new technology in the region).
D. Reforestation and Erosion Control
5.9   Thanks to a determined effort to obtain community participation, tree
nurseries are now managed by groups of planters. Major planting efforts were
undertaken, particalarly on the summits of eroded hillsides. These planting
programs, which exceeded the original goals, were carried out either with project
resources or by communes or private planters.
5.10 Erosion control activities were undertaken with active community
participation. Hillside communities were organized by project agents to dig
contour ditches, plant anti-erosion hedges, and encourage farmers to rotate crops
and take greater care in planting banana trees.



-5-
E. Rehabilitation and Development of Water SuDolV Points
5.11 This activity was executed with active cooperation by local communities.
Project management insisted that agents always cooperate with local communities
on a participative basis and endeavor to ascertain what they regarded as urgent
needs. It is highly possible that this program was instrumental in encouraging
the notable participation by ^ommunities in the road building program and in the
setting up of nurseries to prrc-agate young coffee and forest plants.
F. Monitorina and Evaluation
5.12 This component was one of the weak points of the Kirimiro project although
technical assistance was used. A considerable body of data exists but there is
doubt as to Its reliability; besides, the data were never proces&ed. Although
frequently the subject of concern by supervision missions, this component never
showed any improvement in performance.
G. Livestock
5.13 Introduced late in the course of the project (1988), this component focused
on small stock and emphasized the distribution of young chicks and vaccination.
The resources in play were very limited.
6.    Proiect Results
6.1   The project was successful in meeting its objectives.  It succeeded in
increasing farm household incomes in real terms and is expected to meet or exceed
many of its appraisal targets.
A. Extension
6-.    FoodcroDs.  It is diffi  lt to ascertain what the actual changes were in
total foodcrop production as a result of project activities, since output figures
are available from 1983 onwards only for the seven original communes. No figures
are available for the 17 other communes brought into the project after 1987. In
the seven original communes, fooderop output rose from 159,000 metric tons to
257,000 tons, or an increase of 62 percent over the life of the project. This
represents a 5.5 percent annual increase (a 1.7 percent increase was predicted
by the appraisal report). Rice production increased from 40 to 480 tons and
vegetable production from 32 to 480 tons. Rice and vegetable crops were major
focii of the extension activities.
6.3   Coffee Growina.  Distribution of young plants greatly exceeded goals (30
times), the main consequence being an increase in the total land area under
coffee. However, most new plantaticns have been established on land that is only
marginally productive and show low yield potential.   Project management was
successful in involving farmers in the production of young plants: coffee-tree
nurseries (inputs provided free by the RDC) are managed entirely by planters
associations. Mulching rates to depths of 15 cm or more were used by 80 percent
of the farmers. Demand for fertilizer (urea) declined because both planters and
researchers regard it as unprofitable for coffee, so much so that usage in 1990
was virtually nil. Pruning tools were less and less used because they were



- 6 -
regarded as too expensive.   Spraying with insecticides was practiced in 100
percent of cases.  Yields of coffee parchment per tree are very difficult to
determine and estimates from independent sources vary widely. A complete survey
was to be carried out in 1991. Total output of parchment coffee (washed and
fully washed)  rose more rapidly than anticipated:   from 7,159 metric tons
(average for 1982 and 1983) to 8,965 tons (average for 1986 and 1987 for the
seven original project communes), or an increase of approximately 3.5 percent per
annum as against the 2.8 percent per annum forecast at the appraisal stage. It
is not certain, however, that this rate of growth can be sustained (a possible
lack of mulching materials, new plantations established on marginal land, and an
increase in diseases).  The long-term production increase for the purpose of
calculating the rate of return of the project was therefore adjusted to 2 percent
per annum.
B. Coffee Washing Stations
6.4   These facilities were a novelty in the Kirimiro region.   Farmers have
massively shifted the delivery of their coffee from manual pulping centers to
washing stations during the project period, the only limiting factor being the
distance between the farm and delivery point. The main reason for this shift was
that the price offered to farmers for cherries delivered to washing stations was
the same as the price offered for the equivalent amount of parchment coffee. As
it saved the farmers from certain intermediate tasks (drying, depulping), this
amounted to an incentive large enough to make farmers enthusiastic deliverers of
cherries and encouraged Government to respond by accelerating the establishment
of washing stations. The incentive price was justified by the expectation of a
premium price on the world market for fully washed arabica coffee (about 15
percent on average). This premium was not realized until 1989, due to problems
downstream in the coffee chain (hulling, storage and transport). The implicit
subsidy was indirectly financed through outside funding, but was in the end
justifiea when the quality problems were recognized and resolved (outside the
context of the project).
6.5   Twenty-nine coffee washing stations were cnnstructed during the course of
the project (as against six anticipated at appraisal) and have been responsible
for a cumulative output of 16,500 tons of fully washed parchment coffee of very
high quality (92 percent grade A), with a green to parchment ratio of 82 percent.
At the present time, the throughput of the washing stations is roughly equivalent
to 72 percent of the coffee cherries produced in the region, as against 0 percent
at the time of appraisal. The cherry to parchment ratio is still mediocre (5.6)
owing to poor grading at reception and inadequate management (no management
handbook used, lack of discipline of staff, over-drying and rejection of lower
qualities instead of repassing).
C. Reforestation and Erosion Control
6.6   Approximately 5,800 ha of woodlots were planted in the region.  Although
these are now beginning to generate income (fuelwood, charcoal, poles and wood
for construction), the RDC was unable to provide data on actual income flows.
At the time of the project completion mission, the plantations inspected appeared
to be in good condition. An important agroforestry program (with Grevilea) was
undertaken in coffee plantations on an individual basis.



-7-
6.7   As part of the erosicn control activities, a total of 21 km of protected
ditches were dug in the course of the project. This and other measures (contour
planting, crop rotation, etc.), however, have been insufficient to stop erosion
and soil impoverishment.
D. Rehabilitation and Development of Water Supply Points
6.8   This  activity  far outstripped  original  targets,  with  1,372  springs
rehabilitated as against the 180 anticipated at the time of appraisal.   The
rehabilitation had only positive effects, particularly as reg'.rds health and the
saving of time formerly spent in carrying water (development of new sources).
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
6.9   Despite the collection of a large amount of information, it is not known
what land areas were under cultivation and what quantities were produced on farms
that had the benefit of extension services; in addition, yield figures are
questioned by both extension and research personnel.
F. Livestock
6.10 This component was introduced late in the project, when much o;
management's attention was focussed on other activities, as a result, no results
were apparent at project closing.
G. Training
6.11  Pr,  ct agents have received training in various fields. The RDC organized
training   ograms for administrators of cooperatives and individuals responsible
for running farmer associations.
H. Incomes
6.12 The project was successful in raising farm incomes. A survey of 135 farms
in the Kirimiro region in 1987-88 (three cropping seasons), six years after
commencement of the project, showed cash income from sales to be an estimated FBu
19,570 per household, or FBu 13,890 at 1981 prices.   At appraisal, it was
anticipated that 10 years after project commencement a farm would have cash
income from sales of FBu 10,980 (at 1981 prices).
7.   Economic Results
7.1   The economic rate of return of the project is reestimated at 16.5 percent
(compared with 18 percent estimated at appraisal).   This is an approximate
figure, based on extrapolations of both production volumes and prices (known only
for the years from 1987 to 1990).  Given the lack of data, it has been estimated
that approximately 3 percent of the increase in the volume of existing fooderops
produced and 100 percent of the increase in rice and vegetables production can
be ascribed to project extension efforts. The long-term production increase in
coffee production due to the project was estimated at 2 percent. Where coffee
washing stations are concerned, account has been taken only of marginal gains.
It proved impossible to ascertain what income was obtained on forest plantations



(fuelwood and construction wood), for lack of information on volumes produced and
prices obtained; they have therefore bh n excluded from the rate of return
calculations. The general consensus is -nat this component was successful.
8.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
8.1   The project established a decentralized integrated project authority, but--
towards the end--deficiencies became sufficiently serious to convince both Bank
and Government  to reverse  this  decision.   The reason was not deficient
management; it was mainly that, in spite of the irtention to make RDCs a
commercial operation, they continued to be run as Government services, at cost
levels that were unsustainable. After a study of the functioning of the RDCs had
been carried out, the decision was taken to spin off the revenue generating
activities as independent enterprises (notably the coffee washing stations) and
to revert back to Government the services oriented activities (notably extension
and road maintenance). These decisions were taken with the basic objective to
ensure the sustainability of project results in the long-run. The privatization
of the coffee washing stations is being implemented under the Coffee Sector
Project (Cr. 2123-BU); the transfer of services back to the technical ministries
is being implemented under the Agricultural Services Project (Cr. 2024-BU) and
should be completed by end 1992.
9.    Bank Performance
9.1   The general view is that the Bank,  from the outset,  succeeded  in
establishing a climate of confidence both with the RDC and the central
authorities. This proved to be of particular value for the approval of annual
work plans, which made it possible to respond to both the constraints and
successes achieved during the actual course of execution of the project. Project
management found supervisions effective and helpful.
9.2   The project was monitored on a regular basis, and missions consisted of the
right specialists needed to resolve the particular prob.ems encountered. On the
whole, the RDC appreciated the assistance afforded it by the supervision missions
both in the organizational and technical spheres and in abiding by the general
policy underlying the project. The Bank should have emphasized the importance
of organizing the Monitoring and Evaluation Division more efficiently and should
have insisted on replacing the washing station technologist.
10.   Borrower Performance
10.1 The performance of the RDC was mixed. Much progress was made in terms of
meeting project objectives, despite the many organizational and managerial
problems ereountered while implementing the RDC concep.   Unfortunately, no
meaningful connection was established between research and extension, primarily
because the focus of the research service, at the time, was supply driven and
donors had little interest in on-farm activities.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1 The project made use of technical assistance, particularly in the sphere
of general management (finances, supplies, monitoring).  This assistance was



stable and well integrated into the project apparatus, although more emphasis was
put on its technical than on its training responsibilities, to the extent that
some project agents had difficulties taking over their appointed obligations once
technical assistance staff had departed (e.g., the washing station technologist).
12.   Project Documentation
12.1 According to the project management team, the Staff Appraisal Report was
particularly useful in defining the general policy underlying the project and the
strategy to be followed in drawing up annual work plans. The Credit Agreement,
in turn, was particularly useful in defining and prescribing the use of
administrative procedures (requests for disbursement, procurement methods, etc.).
Data on fooderop production from the beginning of the project was not available
at the time the PCR mission visited Burundi. Other data were obtained from the
RDC or Bank files.
13.   Findings and Lessons Learned
13.1 The major lessons the Bank and the Government can draw from this project
aret
(a)  Managing the project according to annual work plans made it possible
to adjust both activities, budgets and Credit category disbursements
in the light of constraints and successes met with during the
execution process itself. More coffee washing stations could thus
be built and the operating costs could easily be adjusted in light
of the activities of the extension service.
(b)  Emphasis by the extension service on agents to cooperate with local
communities on a participatory basis and to endeavor to ascertain
their most urgent needs, has laid the groundwork for more active
private sector involvement in the follow-up projects (Coffee Sector
Project and Agricultural Services Project).
(c)  The lack of research-extension interaction limited the effectiveness
of the extension services.   No messages could be developed that
addressed basic farmer needs and that could have been instrumental
in combatting plant diseases and erosion.
(d)  Project management teams should ensure that the terms of reference
for the technical assistance clearly define not only their technical
duties but also training responsibilities, especially towards the
end of the contractual period.

Comments:
At identification, the main issue was either to strengthen govern-
ment services or to create a regional development agency to ensure
integrated development. The last prevailed.
Preparation was done by local consultants (SOMEBU).
At appraisal, some components of the projects were eliminated
and/or simplified.
The IDA Credit was closed on June 30, 1988 but operations contin-
ued with IDA financing (SDR 2.0 million) from the Ngozi III
Project (Cr. 1192-BU).

stations were built, a greatly expanded rural infrastructure
program, much higher distribution of coffee plants, and low seed
station efficiency.
