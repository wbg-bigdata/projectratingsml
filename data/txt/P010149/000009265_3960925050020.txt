PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Grain Storage
Project in Nepal, for which Credit 1062-NEP in the amount of SDR 4.8
million (US$6.2 million equivalent) was approved on August 26, 1980. The
Credit was closed on September 30, 1985, one year behind schedule.  The
last disbursement was on July 23, 1986 and an undisbursed balance of about
US$1.84 million was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the UNDP/FAO Management and Organization
Advisor to NFC,  in April 1986.   The Overview and Evaluation Summary
prepared by IDA provide additional information obtained from a review of
the project files and from discussions with officials of the Borrvwer in
April 1989.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report (Attachment).

GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 1062-NEP)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
i.       The Grain Storage Project was intended to support a four-year program
for investments in improved grain storage facilities and technical assistance.
Total estimated project cost of US$ 8.04 million was to be supported with an
IDA Credit of SDR 4.8 million (US$6.2 million). The Credit was closed on
September 30, 1985, one year behind schedule. Final disbursements amounted to
SDR 3.38 million (US$3.37 million) and the remaining balance was cancelled.
Obiectives
ii.      The project wvs intended to support the foodgrain policy in effect in
Nepal at the time of appraisal in 1979. Inadequate storage facilities and
deficient foodgrain marketing practices were perceived as in need of improve-
ment. There were three major policy objectives: (a) to make foodgrains
available to the poor in food-deficit areas; (b) to stabilize foodgrain
prices; and (c) to increase foodgrain production through price subsidization
and to promote exports. Consistent with these objectives, the project was to
(i) increase the Nepal Food Corporation's (NFC) storage capacity and reduce
storage losses through the addition of 40,000 tons of storage capacity
distributed over nine locations; and (ii) provide technical assistance (TA)
and fund studies to strengt.ten NFC's capability for carrying out the construc-
tion program and executing its foodgrain marketing responsibilities under the
Government's foodgrain policy. The NFC was to acquire the assets of eight
rice trading entities jointly owned by the Government and private
traders/millers, known as Rice Export Companies (RECs). Together, these
activities were to allow the NFC to increase direct procurement from farmers.
iii.     Project preparation was undertaken by Nepalese consultants with IDA
guidance. Preparation was accelerated in its final stage to permit adherence
to the project processing schedule. The preparation rc. ,rt was handed to the
appraisal mission in the field. The haste to appraise and the consequent
insufficient review of the preparation report is believed to have contributed
to inadequate attention paid by the appraisal mission to the institutional and
procurement aspects which became major problems during project implementation.
iv.      The Bank did recognize that institutional issues were a significant
concern, and included specific conditionality in the project for the takeover
of the RECs by NFD. However, this merger never took place and, a: late as
April 1989, liquidation of six RECs was still incomplete while two RECs were
operating as multi-purpose trading entities, not involved in foodgrains.
Also, no adequate provisions were made to deal with NFC's financial weakness,
thus causing the losses inherent in the increased level of foodgrain marketing
operations under the project to compound the deficit problem.



Implementation Experience
v.       Project implementation was slow from the start.  The two major imped-
iments to timely physical implementation weres (a) difficulties in procure-
ment; and (b) NFC's administrative and managerial weakness. Diver&ence
between IDA's procurement guidelires and those of the Government on criteria
for award of civil works and equipment contracts, and NFC's and HMG's slow
process to resolve these and other implementation problems caused major delays
in the aggregate.
vi.      Because of the slow implementation, the third pha6se of the construc-
tion program was cancelled, thus leaving out storage destined to serve the
more remote parts of the project area where it was needed most. As a result,
only 27,000 tons of storage was eventually constructed, in five locations, as
opposed to the planned 40,000 tonu in nine locations.
vii.     There were also substantial cost overruns.  Costs for both storage
units constructed and staff operating expenditur2s were approximately twice as
much as projected. However, other storage facil'ties constructed by two
bilateral donors, although designed to higher standards, cost five times as
much per unit of storage space. Study costs, however, were 182 less than
anticipated, and TA was provided under grant funding by UNDP.
viii.    NFC's financial w-akness remained a major problem that prevented the
project's foodgrain procurement goals from being reached. Absence of effec-
tive ways to absorb the operating losses inherent in the public foodgrain
procurement and distribution system cause NFC's financial deficits to mount
and, at Credit closing, liabilities exceeded assets by a ratio of 2:1. As a
result, NFC was at project completion financially worse off than at the
outset.
Results
ix.      When the Credit closed in September 1985, none of the project-built
godowns were completed, and the economic rate of return (ERR) of 182 provided
in the Staff Appraisal Report has become clearl) unachievable. Utilization of
the storage facilities built under the project commenced in late 1986. By
1988, all facilities were in use, albeit at well below capacity (typically
between 7 to 60Y). NFC now believes that the facilities built under this
project are too large, will never be filled, and should not have been
constructed at such scale. Because the godowns were only partially utilized
in 1987 and 1988, rarely exceeding 50X of capacity, calculation of the effec-
tive ERR has not been undertaken, as it would certainly be negative.
x.       The project was not successful.  The PCR is frank in analyzing the
causes: (a) Bank preparation and appraisal missions apparently lacked experi-
ence: (b) implementation schedules were too ambitious, and failed to appreci-
ate the lead-time needed for learning and coaching; (c) tender procedures
lacked clarity; and (d) the Bank's resident office was perceived as having
taking a hands-off attitude in regard to project problems.



- vi -
Sustainability
xi.      There are two notable positive aspects of this project.  First, the
TA accomplished extensive local staff training, which is considered a major
positive point. Second, the layouts and construction quality of godowns built
are both very good. The godowns are suitable to local conditions.
Sustainability of the civil works constructed under this project should not
present problems, assuming proper maintenance. The simple structure of the
godowns will facilitate this.
Findings and Lessons
xii.     The PCR lists numerous lessons to be learned from this project.  The
main ones are that:
(a) Project preparation and appraisal missions should consist of persons
who possess practical experience in implementing this type of project
under the conditions prevailing in countries such as Nepal, thus
ensuring adequate consideration of local difficulties and reducing
the likelihood of misjudgments.
(b) Although intuitively obvious, it is worth emphasizing that it is
important to ensure the facility design corresponds to actual needs,
in terms of unit size and location.
(c)  Specific attention has to be paid to the rules of local tender
procedures where these contradict the Bank procurement guidelines.
Where the lowest bidder has to be preferred, adequate guidelines for
evaluation criteria have to be determined beforehand, thus ensuring
that bids which are outside given criteria will not have to be enter-
tained. Further, prequalification of contractors on the basis of
their reference lists culy, without checking background and actual
performance should be avoided.
(d) Inadequate analysis of an executing agency's institutional capacity
or decision-making authority can prove to be a major flaw, the impli-
cations of which cannot be overemphasized.
(e) When specifying alternative institutional arrangements to be adopted,
every effort must be made to determine whether such arrangements are
both appropriate and compatible with existing legal and authority
structures.
(f) Comunuications between the Borrower and IDA were inadequate, given
the periodic need for clcose consultation during critical project
periods. More effective use of the local Bank office could have
reduced the problems resulting from inadequate comunuications.

GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 1062-NEP)
Overview
General
1.,      The Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Grain Storage Project
(Cr. 1062-NEP) was prepared by the Management and Organizations Advisor to
NFC. It covers all aspects of the project up to April 30, 1986, or about
three months prior to the final disbursement date. At the time the PCR was
written, none of the storage facilities constructed under the project had been
put into service. This overview is therefore intended to supplement the find-
ings of the PCR with IDA's observations and to update the report. For this
purpose, an IDA mission visited Nepal in April 1989.
2.       The PCR summarizes the implementation and achievements of the project
and comments critically on the performance of both the Borrower and IDA,
starting from project identification, with a view to derive lessons from the
experience with this generally unsuccessful project.
3.       The project was identified by IDA in OctoberlNovember 1978 and
prepared by the Nepal Agricultural Projects Seivices Center (APROSC) during
the period January-October 1979 under terms of reference drawn up by IDA.
Preparation was financed by IDA under a Technical Assistance Credit (Cr.
659-NEP). After an IDA mission in May 1979 to assist in project preparation.
an appraisal mission left for Nepal in October 1979 prior to receipt of the
final preparation report, apparentlv because of time constraints in the
processing schedule.  With the benefit of hindsight, in the haste to appraise
the project serious institutional and procurement issues were not fully
recognized and thus led to major problems during project implementation.
Proiect Obiection and Rationale
4.       The project intended to support Nepal's foodgrain policy as in force
at the time of appraisal. This policy had three major objectives: (a) to
make foodgrains available, at subsidized prices, to the poor in food-deficit
areas; (b) to stabilize foodgraih prices; and (c) to stimulate foodgrain pro-
duction by providing producer incentives and to promote exports. To support
these objectives, the project was to increase the storage capacity of the
Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) by 40,000 tons (in nine locations) and to reduce
storage losses. NFC was to acquire the assets of eight Rice Exporting Compan-
ies (RECs) and with the help of the incremental storage capacity increase its
direct foodgrain procurement from farmers. Technical assistance and studies
provided under the project aimed at strengthening NFC in carrying out the
project and in executing its responsibilities under the Government's foodgrain
policy.

Pj      Ar aian   le mentation
5.       The Bank's appraisal mission found that there was a conflict between
REC interests and NFC price subsidization/stabilization objectives. The
mission recommended an institutional merger of RECs with the NFC, with the NFC
assuming full control of ownership and functions of RECs. This proved much
more difficult than expected. The merger was made a condition of negotia-
tions, but the Government finally agreed only to appoint the NFC as managing
agent of RECs, and to merge the two systems in due course. Powerful private
interests prevented the merger of the two institutions. In 1989, liquidation
was still in process for six RECs, while two had been reorganized for trade in
commodities other than foodgrains. In any case, given the serious financial
difficulties of the NEC, it might not have been possible for the NFC to finan-
cially compensate traders/millers for their interests in the RECs.
6.       NFC's financial problems were another impediment to achieving project
objectives. Part of NFC's grain purchases were at market prices, but it has
in turn to sell the grain at Government-determined subsidized prices. This
resulted in steadily mounting losses. 'While the SAR recognized that such
deficits existed, determination of their magnitutde was difficult due to an
absence of audited account records. The SAR inc'udes an Income Statement and
a Balance Sheet, both unaudited. (The Income Statement notes that income
figures were "arbitrarily increasedg to offset the net loss shown on the
Balance Sheet). Thus, although the NFC may have been insolvent from project
inception, the Credit Agreement only asked the Government to finance annual
NFC deficits resulting from foodgrain subsidization starting FY 1982. By the
time of Credit closing, NFC's liabilities exceeded assets by a ratio of more
than 2:1. The NFC was a very weak institution, but it never had a chance to
improve as intended.
7.       There were construction and procurement problems throughout the
project period. Only 27,000 tons rather than the planned 40,000 tons of
storage capacity were constructed. Facilities were built at only five, rather
than the nine planned, sites. None were built in the more remote parts of the
project area where they are most needed. Tenders for weighing equipment were
cancelled due to a lack of adequate procurement guidelines. There were no
procedural guidelines resolving difference in Bank and Government tender
regulation-. This proved to be a major shortcoming, as any issue open to
interpretation created delays.
8.       In addition to not being located in priority areas, storage units
built were inappropriate in that they were too large. In 1989, all IDA-
financed facilities were in use, but usually at less than 402 of capacity.
The project contributed, along with other donor efforts, to expansion of NFC
storage capacity from 28,500 tons at appraisal to 92,000 tons at completion.
Direct procurement from farmers, however, was only 16,000 tons annually.
Considering the use of godowns only began in 1987, and during 1987 and 1988
rarely exceeded 502 of capacity, a re-evaluation of the economic rate of
return (ERR) on the project has not been undertaken, since it would certainly
be negative.
9.       The project cannot be considered a success, in terms of achieving a
satisfactory ERR, becauset (a) at the time of Credit closing, none of the



-x-
ensuring adequate consideration of local difficulties and reducing
chance of misjudgments.
(b) Although intuitively obvious, it is worth emphasizing that it is
important to ensure that facility design correspond to actual needs,
in terms of unit size and location.
(c) Specific attentior. has to be paid to the rules of local tender
procedures where these contradict the Bank procurement guidelines.
Where the lowest bidder has to be preferred, adequate guidelines for
evaluation criteria have to be determined beforehand, thus ensuring
that bids which are outside given criteria will not have to be enter-
tained. Further prequalilication of contractors on the basis of
their reference lists only, without checking background and actual
performance should be avoided.
(d) Inadequate analysis of an executing agency's institutional capacity
or decision-making authority can prove to be a major flaw, the impli-
cations of which cannot be over-emphasized.
(e) When specifying alternative institutional arrangements to be adopted,
every effort must be made to determine whether such arrangements are
both appropriate and compatible with existing legal and authority
structures.
(f) Communications between the Borrower and IDA were inadequate, given
the periodic need for close consultaticn during critical project
periods. More effective use of the local Bank office could have
reduced the problems resulting from inadequate communications.



- ix -
completed facilities were in use; (b) construction and operating costs were
about twice as high as estimated; (c) the NFC was probably less financially
viable at project completion than at inception; and td) effective merger of
the NFC and RECs never took place. Significant underutilization of con-
structed facilities undoubtedly renders a negative ERR for this project
(instead of the 182 anticipated). There was probably insufficient justifica-
tion for recommending abolition of RECs given both the existence of strong
private sector interests and the fact that this sector is usually more effi-
cient in matters of grain procurement than the public sector.
10.      The PCR is critical of Bank performance in the areas of preparation
and supervision. While recognizing the Government's weakness, it maintains
that: (a) inexperienced Bank staff were partly to blame for a less-than-opti-
mal project design; and (b) the Bank, in closing the Credit abruptly and can-
celling the undisbursed part of the Credit, was insensitive to Nepal's needs.
IDA believes that closing the Credit and cancellation was justified, due to:
(i) the poor performance history; and (ii) failure of the institutional devel-
opment aspect of the project. However, financial and procurement problems
could have been addressed more thoroughly at the time of appraisal and during
supervision. Failure to do so led to unsatisfactory agreements regarding both
improvement of the NFC and elimination of the private sector. Further, it
allowed less than clear procurement rules and re3ulations to prevail.
Summary of Findings
11.      On balance, the project was not successful.  These are primarily four
reasons for this conclusion:
-    the NFC was probably less viable at project completion than at incep-
tion;
-    the difficulty of attaining the institution-building objective was
seriously underestimated;
-    only two-thirds of planned project investments were made, due to
delays, cost over-runs and general lack of efficiency; and
-    project facilities remained incomplete until after the Credil: closing
date, and the utilization rate since 1986 has typically been less
than 402.
However, project performance was good in two respects. Construction quality
of godowns was very good, and the training component was successful due to
effective technical assistance.
Lessons Learned
12.      A number of lessons can be learned from the experience with this
project:
(a) Appraisal and project preparation missions should consist of persons
who possess practical experience in implementing this type of project
under the conditions prevailing in countries such as Nepal, thus

GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 1062-NEP)
PROJECT CO1PLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      Climatic and geographic conditions divide Nepal into zones with
differing agricultural production potentials. Consequently, foodgrain
movements from surplus to deficit areas have constituted a traditional pattern
in the life of the inhabitants. With a population growth of 2.66Z per year,
destruction of nature, as well as the stress on existing agro-ecosystems
resulting in erosion and declining yields, and the development of political
structures able to exert pressure, an increasing involvement of the government
in the foodgrain marketing process occurred.
1.2      Although the country in normal years is still capable of producing
enough food for her population and even achieve some surplus, available for
export, there is a trend towards increasing precariousness in regard to suffi-
cient food supplies at the national or at a given area level. This demands
constant attention by the government and adequate preparation of all matters
connected with the country's food security situation and, consequently, the
foodgrain marketing sector responsible for 752 to 85? of the calorie intake.
1.3      It was with this background that the Grain Storage Project was
developed. During the time of project preparation and appraisal (1978 to
1980), Government foodgrain operations were conducted by:
(a) the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, responsible for policy
decisions and monitoring;
(b) the Nepal Food Corporation (NFC), charged with the implementation of
His Majesty's Government (HMG) internal food distribution policy;
and
(c) eight Rice Export Companies (RECs) as joint ventures with the pri-
vate sector and HEG as the majority shareholder.
Their task included: (i) the procurement of foodgrains, mainly in the Terai
belt; (ii) provision of low-priced rice to NFC for internal distribution; and
(iii) undertaking of rice exports.
1.4       Major difficulties faced by foodgrain marketing entities controlled
by the government were:
(a) their lack of suitable storage facilities resulting in high storage
losses and rent payments and limiting effective primary procurement



-2-
operations and the defense of the support price for paddy rice and
wheat as announced by the government;
(b) quality control problems for rice export arrangements and the need
for better qualified and trained management and technical personnel;
and
(c) insufficient storage capacity for developing and maintaining food-
grain reserve stocks to improve the country's food security
position.
1.5       In order to overcome these shortcomings, the project planned to
construct 40,000 Lone of storage capacity at nine sites in the Terai belt and
to provide various components of technical assistance to improve operations of
government foodgrain marketing, estimated to require financial resources of
US$8.04 million. Financing was to be undertaken by the International Develop-
ment Association (IDA) contributing US$6.2 million expressed in Special Draw-
ing Rights (SDR) 4.8 million and by HMG and NFC participation for local costs
of US$1.8 million and US$0.04 million respectively.
1.6       With the signing of the Project Document "Technical Assistance for
Strengthening the NFC Management," with the United Nations Development Pro-
gramme (UNDP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) as executing agency on August 5, 1981, the technical assistance compo-
nent of the project was to be carried out by a UNDP/FAO input amounting to
US$951,400.
1.7       Construction of the grain storage facilities was planned to commence
with the recruitment of a Chief Engineer (International) in August 1980.
Actual storage construction was planned for:
Phase I:    July 1981 to June 1982
Phase II:   January 1982 to December 1982
Phase III:  July 1982 to June 1983.
At project termination on March 31, 1986, five project sites of Phases I and
II with a storage capacity of 27,000 tons were available, but neither facili-
ties nor equipment could so far be utilized for foodgrain marketing opera-
tions.
1.8       In the meantime, institutional changes which occurred on the part of
HMG since project inception included:
(a) the transfer of policy decision and monitoring and the supervision
of the Nepal Food Cosporation from the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture to the Ministry of Commerce and Supplies in 1981 and the
Ministry of Supplies in 1983; and
(b) ceasing of the functions of the eight Rice Export Companies in 1980,
leaving NFC as the sole governmental corporation responsible for
foodgrain marketing operations.



1.9       Project objectives are still valid and HMG continues to give
priority to all aspects connected with foodgrain production and marketing as
reflected in the directives of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1985/86 to
1989/90). Major emphasis remains ons
(a) protection of the interests of the farmers by developing, in addi-
tion to private trade, an alternative primary procurement marketing
channel for foodgrains which is capable of securing minimum prices
for foodgrains and of providing a procurement price stabilization
effect through the full utilization of existing marketing
infrastructures consisting of "Sajha' cooperatives, farmer groups,
NFC and other governmental development programs; and
(b) improvement of the reserve stock policy of foodgrains throug. proper
maintenance of sufficient reserve stocks for:
(i)   foodgrain distribution to food-deficit areas;
(ii)   emergency supplies in case of disasters and food shortage sit-
uations until outside replenishments arrive; and
(iii)   price stabilization measures in the interest of the low-income
consumers in the consumer centers of the accessible hill areas
and the Terai.



II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation
2.1       At HMG request, an IDA project identification mission visited Nepal
in October/November 1978 and prepared a detailed outline of the project terms
of reference for project preparation. For this task, HMG engaged the
Agricultural Projects Services Center (APROSC) which began its assignment in
January 1979. Financing for project preparation was provided under the Nepal
Technical Assistance Project (IDA Credit 659-NEP). A second IDA mission
visited Nepal in Hay 1979 to assist APROSC in its project preparation work,
and in October 1979, APROSC submitted the preparation report consisting of
three volumes.
2.2       The preparation report arrived at a project proposal amounting to
project costs of Nepal Rupees (NRs) 79 million (US$6.6 million) to be financed
by IDA (85Z) and HMG (15)Z with a repayment period of 25 years with 4 years
grace. It recommended the construction of grain storage facilities for 45,000
tons at 11 sites utilizing 1,000-ton units and provided for handling and qual-
ity control equipment. The formation or inclusion of a Project Implementatiou
Unit, a Project Coordination Committee, training, technical assistance compo-
nent and a marketing study were also suggested. The estimated project imple-
mentation period was from May 1980 to July 1983. Based on reduction of rent
payments, operation costs and grain storage losses, the economic rate of
return was calculated at NRs 13.2 million per year or 15.3Z.
2.3       Earlier requests for 40 trucks to NFC and suggestions for forklifts
and sack elevators were ruled out by the preparation report. Storage develop-
ment programs by: UNDP (NEP/73/009) for 10,000 tons at seven sites from 1976
to 1978 with actual completion of 7,500 tons at seven sites from 1976 to 1982;
and United Kingdom Overseas Development Administration (ODA) for 12,750 tons
at ten sites in the hills and the Terai from 1976 to 1979 with actual
completion of 12,000 tons at two sites in Kathmandu 1976 to 1985 have also
been considered in the project plans.
Appraisal
2.4       The staff appraisal report (SAR) was based on the findings of a
five-man IDA appraisal mission, which visited Nepal in October/November 1979
(Report No. 2862-NEP, July 24, 1980). Recommendations closely followed the
outlined objectives and proposals of the preparation report. In negotiations
with 1MG, a number of preconditions and foodgrain marketing policy decisions
to be implemented in relation with the project were determined and stipulated
in the appraisal report and the project agreement.
2.5       In comparison with the preparation report, the SAR undertook the
following major changes:
(a) It reduced the construction component to nine sites with a storage
capacity of 40,000 tons.
(b) Investments for equipment were adjusted in accordance with the
reduced construction component.



(c) Expenditure for training and technical assistance was increased and
more specified.
(d) A project implementation period of about three years was assumed as
from August 1980 to August 1983.
2.6       The summary of project costs and the financing plan amounted to:

Foreign exchange component         39,551       50.0   47,380    3,950       49.2
2.7       During actual project implementation, major adjustments of the SAR
occurred in:
(a) the time schedule, extending Phases I and II from August 1983 to
March 1986;
(b) the design of the stores, replacing the 1,000-ton units whenever
adequate by 2,000-ton and 1,500-ton units, changing the height from
4.50 m to 5.65 m and adjusting the ventilation system;
(c) reduction and, at the end, the cancellation of Phase III due to
higher construction costs and delays in project implementation; and
(d) the elimination of the weighbridges and platform scales caused by
tender delays and the IDA decision of not extending the project
beyond March 31, 1986.
2.8       After project completion, a critical assessment of project prepara-
tion and appraisal identifies the following major shortcomings:
(a) Construction and land cost calculations were considerably high.
Thus, the SAR envisaged for Phases I and II investment costs for the
storage complexes of NRs 40,121,000, compared to actual costs of NRs



72,335,578. an increase of +80.3Z. Planned costs for the Project
Engineering Unit (PEU) amounted to NRs 5,275,600 in relation to
actual costs of NRs 9,768,820.93 or +85.2Z. These differences cannot
be related to price increases only l/ but
include basic cost underestimates as well.
(b) The Fumigation Unit proposal forgot operational considerations under
Nepal conditions, requiring allocation of responsibility for stocks
at a godown to the storekeeper concerned and enable him to protect
his stocks. This is an example of suggesting sophisticated
procedures before exploiting simple solutions.
(c)  No attempt was made to compare IDA procurement and tender procedures
with HHG regulations, HKG although NFC board and management were
supposed to consider both in their decision-making process. These
missing clarifications and guidelines became the source of delays,
for which IDA later blamed the implementing agency.
(d) Similarly, no orientation was presented for price escalations, the
procedures to be adopted and references to be used under such
occurrences. This negligence on the part of IDA contributed to
another delay of six months in 1985.
(e) Storage construction plans gave little consideration to advanced
designs applicable to the climatic conditions in the Terai or to
verifying better solutions already utilized by private trade in
Nepal.
Price increase of all goods and services, Nepal:
1979180 = +9.8Z; 1980/81 - 13.42 (10.5Z); 1981/82 = +10.4Z (9.0?);
1982/83 - +14.2Z (8.02); 1983/84 - +6.2Z (7.0?); 1984/85 - +7.0Z

III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION, TARGETS AND GOALS
Proiect Description
3.1       The purpose of the project was to assist HMG in constructing storage
facilities, to maintain the quality and reduce the losses of foodgrains, and
to strengthen the operatins of NFC in order to enable it to implement
Nepalese foodgrain procurement, reserve stock and distribution policies more
effectively.
3.2       In order to zchieve these objectives, the project concept attempted
to provide the following inputs:
(a) to undertake the construction of required storage facilities in the
Terai belt, thus overcoming the constraint in the form of unsuitable
or insufficient physical facilities on which the development of
foodgrain marketing activities depend, such as primary procurement,
the maintenance of reserve stocks and economic distribution
arrangements;
(b) to ensure the availability of adequate equipment, necessary for the
improvement of quality control operations, pest control measures and
the handling of foodgrains;
(c) for capacitating the executing agency, NFC, to undertake the
required planning, tendering, procurement and construction
supervision activities, the Project Engineering Unit was
established;
(d) to strengthen the operational effectiveness of NFC, support in
training and technical assistance had been provided for, which was
later on assumed by a UNDP/FAO project (NEP/80/008); and
(e)  for further detailed information about the foodgrain marKeting
sector in Nepal, funds were earmarked for three relevant studies
aimed at assisting HMG in the formulation of suitable marketing
policies.
3.3       For project monitoring and support, various entities were estab-
lishedt
(a) the Management Support Unit within NFC headed by a Deputy General
Manager;
(b)  a Project Management and Coordination Committee (PMCC) to vieet at
least quarterly, including:
(i)   the Secretary, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, as Chairman
(in 1981, the Secretary, Ministry of Supplies, assumed the
chairmanship);
(ii)   Joint Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture;



- 8 -
(iii)   Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance;
(iv)   Joint Secretary, National Planning Commission;
(v)   the Director General, Food and Agricultural Marketing Services
Department (FAMSD);
(vi)   the General Manager of NFC;
(vii)   the Chief Engineer of PEU; and
(viii)   a member of the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADB/N).
(c) A technical subcommittee for assisting the Board of NFC in the
decision-making process in technical project matters, consisting of:
(i)   the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Supplies;
(ii)   a Senior Engineer of the Ministry of Works and Transport; and
(iii)   a Senior Engineer of the Ministry of Agriculture.
Targets and Goals
3.4       The basic objective of the project was to assist HMG and its
executing foodgrain marketing agency, NFC, in the development of more
effective and economic marketing operations.  While this goal is still valid,
actual achievements and improvements so far have not reached the anticipated
project targets.
3.5       Adequate storage facilities, being a technical ptecondition for
expanding primary procurement activities on the part of NFC, were not forth-
coming due to the delays in project implementation and thus in godown con-
struction. In addition, foodgrain procurement plans, particularly in the
midwestern and far-western regions, where, due to prevailing infrastructu_es,
NFC efforts in protecting farmer prices are more urgently required, were
hampered by the cancellation of Phase III.
3.6       Although HMG hopes to close this gap through the Grant Assistance
Project of the Government of Japan for foodgrain storee at Mahendranagar
(1,000 tons), Dhangadhi (4,000 tons) and Rajapur (5,500 tons) with an estima-
ted completion in 1987/88, the objective of creating a storage chain permit-
ting the development of an alternative and effective countrywide procurement
network has been delayed considerably.
3.7       Attempts by NFC to expand its primary procurement of foodgrain oper-
ations with available facilities constantly encountered financial restriction,
since sound financial arrangements for NFC, as envisaged by the project, so
far have not materialized.
3.8       Despite the shortcomings in regard to stora6e facilities and finan-
cial support, progress has been made in improvi.g organization, professional



- 9 -
understanding, storage maintenance and pest control measures, etc. of NFC with
the help of the technical assistance component which only became effective
towards the end of 1983. Primary procurement efforts in 1984/85 and 1985/86
demonstrated that NFC would be capable of executing an active procurement
policy and defending a minimum price policy on the basis of the procurement
plans and strategies developed, provided existing technical and financial
constraints are removed.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Start-up
4.1       The Project Agreement (PA) and Development Credit Agreement (DCA)
were signed on January 14, 1981. However, Credit effectiveness only commenced
on July 31, 1981, creating an initial delay of seven months. Recruitment of
the Chief Engineer with a Swiss consultancy firm was completed with the
contract signature on October 27, 1981. The consultant engineer arrived on
November 16, 1981 to establish the Project Engineering Unit. Thus, actual
project operation started with a 15-month delay compared with the SAR
timetable.
Revisions to Original Plans
4.2       Due to initial delays, various changes on the target dates set in
the Legal Documents were agreed upon during the IDA mission in September/
October 1981. The engagement of consultants under the UNDP-financed Technical
Assistance Project NEP1801008 was also accepted as was the preparation of an
additional study 'Primary Market Procurement of Foodgrains by the Public
Sector' to be prepared by APROSC.
4.3       Until October 1982, after consultation with IDA missions. various
design details and specifications of godowns were altered following the recom-
mendations of the Project Engineering Unit. Major changes included:
(a) continuous loading bay on only one side of godown, saving in con-
struction costs of stores and roads;
(b) installation of screened sliding doors (bird and theft proof) behind
shutter doors, inside the godown, for more effective ventilation
allowing the deletion of bottom ventilators in walls;
(c) reduction of windows to minimum acceptable daylight;
(d) ramp protection of loading bays with heavy anchored angle iron and
wooden baffles;
(e) construction of 1,500-ton and 2,000-ton godowns instead of 1,000-ton
units whenever possible. Change of external dimension from 30.5 m x
19.2 m x 4.5 m tot
-    1,000-ton store: 30.62 m x 19.30 m x 5.65 m
-    1,500-ton store: 45.88 m x 19.30 m x 5.65 m
-    2,000-ton store: 61.14 m x 19.30 m x 5.65 m
(height from ground slab to bottom chord of the truss);
(f) elimination of roof ventilators, replaced by escape slits for hot
and humid air through the corrugated iron sheets at the ridge;



- 11 -
(g) protection of ground slab by bitumen felt instead of polyethylene
sheet; and
(h) adjustment of the size of ancillary buildings in accordance with
operational requirements.
Most of the changes reduced construction costs and are considered an
improvement to earlier plans.
4.4       In October 1983, due to an increase in project costs and a decrease
of the US dollar equivalent from 6.2 million to 5.2 million, the reduction or
deletion of Phase III was considered. The project credit closing date was
extended to March 31, 1985, for Phases I and II and for Phase III to December
31, 1985.
4.5       It was agreed that construction of Phases I and II was to be
executed concurrently. On the equipment side, considering operational
difficulties and costs, the elimination of the paddy rice driers was suggested
by IDA. For various expired dates, again new deadlines were established for
actions to be undertaken by HHG (see also Annex 1).
4.6       In April 1984, it was decided to reduce Phase III to a 5,000 to
6,000-ton unit at Nepalgunj to be completed on March 31, 1987. The review
mission in December 1984 agreed to the extension of the closing date to Sep-
tember 30, 1985. Development of Phase III was linked with the progress of
Phases I and II until July 15, 1985.
4.7       In September 1985, IDA. communicated by telex information to termi-
nate project activities for Phases I and II on March 31, 1986. Phase III was
canceled. Payment of a price escalation of about 11.12 to the construction
was approved. Since time for retendering and supply of weighbridges and plat-
form scales was not sufficient, these equipments were no longer available for
the project sites.
4.8       In February 1986, it was agreed by IDA and NFC that the Project
Completion Report (PCR) was to be prepared by the Management and Organization
Advisor of the UNDP/FAO Project.
Implementation Schedule
4.9       A comparison between the original time schedule of the SAR with
subsequent adjustments and the actual implementation of the major project
components is shown in Annex 2.
4.10      Project implementation started off with an initial delay of seven
months until credit effectiveness on July 31, 1981. Actual project work only
commenced after the arrival of the Chief Engineer on November 16, 1981. Com-
pared with the envisaged original arrival date of August 31. 1980, this
amounted to an initial project delay of 14.5 months. If this time is added to
the termination date of Phase II on December 31, 1982, present project imple-
mentation of Phases I and II should have been completed in March 1984. The
result was a delay of implementation for the construction component of two
years.



- 12 -
4.11      Major factors causing this situation weres
(a) the need for retendering Phase I due to discrepancies;
(b) unrealistic mobilization time for contractors requiring three to
four months instead of one month. Therefore, activities started in
the beginning of the monsoon time which hampered foundation work;
(c) various shortages of cement and a severe monsoon period in 1984;
(d) price increases for construction materials (cement, +302; steel
material, +50-60Z) resulting in requests for price escalations by
the contractors in March 1985 and a slowdown of the works until
agreements were reached in October 1985; and
(e) delays in decision-taking by NFC management and board, the supervis-
ing ministry and other offices whose consent was required in regard
to tender evaluation and allocation and in deciding on price
adjustments, etc.
4.12      Since construction had been delayed, procurement of equipment also
started late. The decision of the NFC board to cancel and retender the tender
of weighbridges and scales in September 1985 resulted in the elimination of
these weighing equipments which could no longer be supplied until the project
termination date of March 19J6.
4.13      The technical assistance support also experienced a slow start due
to the formation of the UNDP/FAO project. Project inputs during the initial
phase encountered various difficulties and effective project work only com-
menced towards the end of 1983. However, agreement was reached to extend
project assistance until December 31, 1986, thus ensuring proper overlapping
with the completion of the IDA Grain Storage Project.
4.14      The envisaged marketing studies of the project were carried out by
APROSC. Delays in report submission did not affect project execution.
Reporting
4.15      Under the DCA, NFC was asked to furnish IDA with project information
at regular intervals. For this purpose, a quarterly reporting system was
agreed upon and IDA missions provided various outlines and suggestions for
report preparation.
4.16      Based on available records, NFC provided quarterly reports for the
following quarters ending: July 15, 1983, October 15, 1983, April 15, 1984,
July 15, 1984, October 15, 1984, January 15, 1985, April 15, 1985, July 15,
1985, October 15, 1985, January 15, 1986, and April 15, 1986.
Procurement
4.17      After negotiations of three months, the Chief Engineer was recruited
through a Swiss consultancy firm. When his contract terminated in Novemoer



- 13 -
1984, he continued to work with the project on an individual basis. His
contract expired on April 30, 1986. Recruitment of local personnel for the
PEU proceeded within NFC regulations and created no major problems.
4.18      Land acquisition, although somehow delayed in the case of Lahan, did
not affect project execution.

4.19      Tender procedures for building construction had to observe IDA and
HKG regulations. Considering the severe reprimanding actions HMG applies to
officers involved in irregularities and the considerable pressure of interest
groups during the allocation process of such a tender in Nepal, NFC management
and Board moved cautiously in these matters until the necessary consensus was
established. To safeguard itself, the Board also formed a Technical Sub-
committee.  As a result, tender allocations were delayed and a retendering of
Phase I became necessary.  Consequently, the tendering process from tender
prequalification invitation in April 1983 to contract award in January 1984
took nine months in comparison to the five months allocated by IDA.
4.20      While for IDA the project was relatively small, with straightforward
technical procedures, the whole process on the part of HHC/NFC had to be
treated as a more complex matter. Shortcomings could seriously affect the
persons involved. This demanded a cautious consensus-creating approach. The
absence of procedural guidelines, considering differences in IDA and HMG
tender regulations, proved to be a major shortcoming since anything open to
interpretation created delays. The need became evident for establishing a
clear understanding in all procedures before project implementation and more
sensitivity in relation to local socioeconomic conditions on the part of IDA.
4.21      The system of tender allocation to the lowest bidder caused in the
case of contractors' attempts to recuperate envisaged lossas afterwards which
did not foster progress at construction sites. This rule was also the main
reason why the tender for weighing equipment had to be canceled in order to
avoid an unsuitable supplier leading to the elimination of these essential
equipments at all storage sites due to insufficient time for new tenders.
Proper orientation together with the provision of tender specifications suc-
cessfully utilized in other projects could have avoided such pitfalls.

4.23      The fIrst technical assistance personnel provided under the UNDP/FAO
project arrived in June 1982. Initial difficulties arose in regard to the
early appointment of a Management and Organization Advisor who was to lead the
project. Since November 1983, project work and integration into NFC
activities proceeded smoothly and all major project inputs could be provided.
Cost Development
4.24      Due to delays in project implementation, price increases for major
construction materials, changes in the value of the dollar and devaluation of
the Nepal Rupee by 14.7Z on November 30. 1985, considerable changes in rela-
tion to the original cost estimates of the appraisal report took place.

4.26      These data clearly indicate that the original appraisal costs con-
siderably diverged from the target. Construction costs on the basis of the
tender awards for Phases I and II for 27,000 tons storage capacity exceeded
the estimated total costs for 40,000 tons by NRs 8.89 million or by 17.2X. In
relation to .he estimated construction costs for Phases I and II of NRs 34.626
million, tender award costs of NRs 60.527 million were NRs 25.901 million or
74.8Z higher. Final project costs, including the price adjustments agreed
upon in October 1985, amount to NRs 67,336,288 for the construction component.
This exceeds original project estimates for 40,000 tons by 30.42 and the
calculations for Phases I and II by 94.5Z. Such discrepancies were bound to
crea:e difficulties in project execution which finally resulted in abolishing
Phase III in production zones where, from the operational marketing point of
view, such inputs would have been of the highest benefit.
4.27      Costs for project equipment, including the two fumigation units,
amounted to:

Due to the exclusion of grain dryers, platform scales, weighbridges and the
reduced number of quality control equipment and wooden pallets, actual
expenses for equipment only reached NRs 4,286,047. This resulted in a saving
of NRs 4,649,583 or 52.0X. However, whether, with the absence of scales and
weighbridges at the storage sites of Phases I and II, later on higher opera-
tional costs in foodgrain handling will occur requiring detailed follow-up
assessments. In the long-term perspective, it is anticipated that the absence
of these essential equipments will be felt as a disadvantage for efficient
foodgrain marketing operations.
4.28      For the Project Engineering Unit (PEU), the following cost
development emergeds

Note:     These costs include consulting fees of SFr 738,500.
Mainly due to project prolongation and higher consultant costs, estimated
costs increased by NRs 4,493,221 or 85.2? for this project component.
4.29      In the appraisal report, two studies were envisaged.  In October
1981, a third foodgrain marketing study was accepted by IDA. Costs for three
marketing studies, all executed by APROSC, amounted to:

With actual costs of NRs 2,932,711, this project segment was NRs 660,889 or
18.4Z cheaper than originally estimated.
4.30      For technical assistance and training, total costs of US$880,000
were earmarked. With the formation of the UNDP/FAO project NEP/80/008 allo-
cating project funds of US$951,400 for project execution, the IDA Grain Stor-
age Project saved expenses for this project component, permitting utilization
of these funds for other project expenditures.
Financial Sources
4.31      Financing of the Grain Storage Project was based on an IDA contribu-
tion of SDR 4.8 million amounting at the time of project appraisal to US$6.2
million or 772 of project costs and an HMG/NFC participation of US$1.84 mil-
lion or 23?, based on the following project financing plan (in NRs million):

Actual financial inputs by HHGINFC of NRs 16.25 million or 19.02 and IDA of
NRs 69.08 million or 81.0?, despite project reduction and changes in expendi-
ture for project components do not show major diversion.
4.32      IDA credit conditions include a service charge of 0.752 p.a. on the
principal amount of the credit withdrawn and outstanding from time to time
which shall be payable semiannually on June 15 and December 15 each year. HMG
shall repay the principal amount of the credit in semiannual installments com-
mencing December 15, 1990, and ending June 15, 2030. Each installment to and
including the installment payable on June 15, 2000, to be 0.5Z of such princi-
pal amount, and each installment thereafter to be 1.5Z of such principal
amount. For currency transactions, the US dollar was specified.
4.33      Planned and actual disbursement of the financial sources is shown in
Annex 5. Due to delays in project implementation, the peak of disbursements
moved to the actual construction period 1984 to 1986. At the original project
termination date of September 30, 1984, only NRs 9,740,456 or 13.9? were spent
while project disbursement for the extension period October 1, 1984, to March
31, 1986, amounted to NRs 60,499,872 or 86.1Z.
4.34      At project termination on March 31, 1986, a total amount of
NRs 11.06 million or 11.52 of the total estimated project budget remained
unspent. If from these unspent finances the saving on technical assistance
and training, taken over by the UNDPIFAO project, of NRs 10.55 million or
10.92 of the estimated finance plan and the costs for the studies of NRs 3.59
million or 3.7? are deducted, a deficit of NRs 3.08 million occurs. This is
the overspent amount from the calculated investment for 40,000 tons of storage
capacity after actual construction of only 27,000 tons on the basis of Nepal
rupees. Due to the changes in exchange rates, it is estimated that in terms
of US dollars, an amount of 0.5 million remained unspent due to the IDA deci-
sion to terminate project activities on March 31, 1986.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
(a) Project Engineering Unit
4.35      The PEU proved to be the most essential factor for the project
implementation process. Due to the dedication, professional interest and
constant attention to all details of the Chief Engineer and the local PEU
staff members, it was possible to achieve the storage facility constructions
of Phases I and II at a remarkable level of quality standards for conditions
in Nepal. Although construction delays, which were outside PEU influence, are
lamentable, it has to be realized that in comparison to earlier godown con-
struction programs, considerable improvements could be achieved by this
project:

This result is mainly due to the efforts of the PEU staff.

project program, the Chief Engineer and two senior engineers during the first
stage and since August 1985 one senior engineer for all five sites dedicated
considerable time and efforts towards assisting the two building contractors
in overcoming their organizational difficulties and in finding workable solu-
tions when construction or material supply problems occurred. This continuous
assistance and support is acknowledged by all parties concerned. It was the
main reason that further construction delays and cost escalations could be
avoided and that the envisaged quality standards of the constructions were
maintained.
4.37      The continuous on-the-job training by the Chief Engineer of NFC
engineers, overseers and other PEU staff members resulted in the positive side
effect that the corporation now possesses a nucleus of qualified and experi-
enced staff members capable of developing and supervising future storage con-
struction and building programs.
(b) Building Contractors
4.38      The contract for the godown constructions of 16,000 tons at Birtamod
and Biratnagar in Phase I was allocated to CIMMCO International from India on
the basis of the lowest bid.  The tender award amounted to NRs 29,935,791.10.
On October 16, 1985, the contract was increased by a sum of NRs 3,439,993 on
the basis of price escalations, arriving at a final contract sum of
NRs 33,375,784.69.
4.39      Cooperation with CIMKCO International experienced some problems due
to frequent changes in their management responsible for the construction sites
in Nepal. After October 1985, relations started to improve. The company
finally performed as it was always felt it could if it wanted. Remaining work
of CIMMCO after March 31, 1986, was covered by a second supplementary contract
until April 30, 1986, to be completed with available contract funds of
NRs 3,054,674.68 or 9.1Z of the total contract.
4.40      The contract for storage facilities of 11,000 tons at Lahan,
Janakpur and Hetauda under Phase II was allocated to the National Construction
Company Nepal, Ltd. (NCCN) on the basis of lowest bid by using the project



- 20 -
agre.,ment clause which may grant a margin of preference of 7.52 to domestic
contractors. The tender award amounted to NRs 30.6 million. On October 16,
1985, the contract was increased by a lump sum of NRs 3.4 million on the basis
of price escalations, arriving at a final contract sum of NR8 34.0 million.
4.41      Since NCCN possessed qualified manpower and sufficient contract
experience, working relationship did not encounter any problems. The main
difficulty of NCCN as a government entity centered =round a chronic shortage
of money. NFC, with the approval of IDA, did its best to overcome these
problems of the contractor by providing advances or purchasing construction
material with NFC funds, etc. Remaining work of NCCN after March 31, 1986,
was covered by a secondary supplementary contract until April 30, 1986, to be
completed with available contract funds of NRs 3.5 million or 10.32 of the
total contract.
4.42      Construction progress for all sites is stown in Annex 6.  Develop-
ment clearly indicates the stagnation periods during the monsoon, and the
cement shortage in 1984 and the slowdown of the contractors when pressing for
price escalation adjustments from March to September 1985. Final efforts to
complete construction in time are obvious too.
(c) Equipment Suppliers
4.43      No major difficulties occurred in the supply of cars, motorcycles
and quality control equipment from Japanese suppliers.
Technical Assistance and Training
4.44      This component of the project was financed by UNDP with FAO as
executing agency. Technical assistance included the provision of advisor
services in the fields of Management and Organization [38 man-months (m/m)],
Quality Control (24 m/m), Training (12 m/m), Finance and Internal Audit (30
m/m) and National Consultants (48 mi/m).  In addition, a wide range of training
programs including local training courses, on-the-job training programs, study
tours and fellowships have been carried out. HMG/UNDP/FAO agreed to continue
project assistance until December 31, 1986, thus ensuring a proper overlapping
with the delayed Grain Storage Project. Due to project savings, this was
possible at the original project budget of US$951,400. A list of major
project reports and manuals, which have been prepared so far, are shown in
Annex 7.
4.45      After a delay of two years, the Management and Organization Advisor
and Chief Technical Officer (CTA) arrived in November 1983. In close collabo-
ration with NFC management, analysis reports and professional orientation were
provided, resulting in a wide range of organizational changes and operational
adjustments of NFC activities and training programs. It is anticipated that
until project termination, all envisaged inputs for this sector will be
completed. After the departure of technical assistance personnel in these
fields, CTA also assumed the technical supervision of the quality control and
training segment, guidance of the National Consultants in their accounts and
audit work and supervision of the installation of a small computer unit at
NFIC.



- 21 -
4.46          Until December 1986, the remaining program of work of the
project was to concentrate on aspects such as:
(a) assistance in the organization of the newly constructed storage
facilities;
(b) program preparations for expanded primary procurement and marketing
acti'-ities ensuring proper utilization of these investments;
(c) orientation in further improvements of the management information
system, incorporating possible assistance through computer
utilization;
(d) follow-up and on-the-job training in the fields of accounts and
internal audit to get the new accounts procedures functioning;
(e) continuation of training activities in all fields;
(f) attempts to find donors to close the gap left by the missing weigh-
ing equipment at the IDA stores and to facilities at Nepalgunj,
deleted by IDA; and
(g) on-the-spot orientations assisting NFC management in maintaining
operational standard- so far achieved.
4.47      IV 1984, with the assistance of a Quality Control
Advisor systematic practice-urientated training programs for 83 storekeepers
and 14 Food Technology Assistants of NFC and 46 storekeepers of World Food
Program stores were conducted and followed up by on-the-spot inspection and
training activities. Within this context, "Technical Codes of Practice for
Procurement and Storage of Foodgrains and Other Commodities," "A Compendium of
Training in Storage Management and Technology" and detailed written and visual
aids training material in Nepali were also prepared. Follow-up work continued
under the NFC counterpart officers and CTA, ensuring that most NFC stores are
now properly managed. Detailed operational procedures, job descriptions, etc.
for the operation of the Grain Storage Project sites have already been
prepared by t}o- CTA and NFC officers and are presently tested at the Nakhu
depot constructed by ODA.
4.48      From June 1982 to December 1983, an expatriate Finance and Internal
Audit Advisor assisted NFC. In considering the need for accounts and audit
manuals and training activities in Nepali, in September 1984, the project.
with the consent of NFC, recruited two qualified local Chartered Accountants
as National Consultants. As a result, detailed manuals in Nepali are now
available to NFC in the forms of "Accounting System Manual," "Inventory
Accounting and Control Systems Manual" and 'Internal Audit Manual." All these
manuals were discussed and approved in workshops with 56 NFC accounts and
internal audit staff. Thereafter, countrywide training courses for 274
accounts staff were conducted in 1985. NFC bodrd and management agreed to
print and distribute new accounts books and forms. Presently, on-the-job
training at the various NFC field offices are conducted by the National Con-
sultants ensuring that with the financial year 1986/87 NFC accounts procedures
can be switched over to the nev system.



- 22 -
4.49      For one year (September 1982 to 1983), the project also employed a
Training Advisor. Thereafter, the CTA and NFC Training Officer undertook
these activities. Apart from training programs for storekeepers, accounts and
audit personnel courses and workshops were held for:
29 managers in the field of training (1983);
44 managers in primary procurement (1984);
60 managers in program execution and problem-solving (1985/86).
In addition, since 1984 twenty-one NFC managers attended study tours and
fellowships to countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, Malaysia. India, etc.
4.50      After initial difficulties in 1982/83, when project performance did
not meet NFC expectations, a close and fruitful working relationship was
established, concentrating on problem-solving instead of problem-listing
activities. Although most project recommendations have been accepted by NFC
management, actual implementation is sometimes delayed until the necessary
consensus has been reached, approvals have been forthcoming or time is con-
sidered ripe for action. However, over time it can be noted that NFC
developments are moving in the right direction. But this does not always
happen with the speed as stipulated in project plans and targets set by
foreigners who are not fully acquainted with the complexity of the local
operational pattern.
4.51      Thus, the technical assistance project was unable to overcome the
following shortcomings of NFC:
(a) The delay in the preparation of the corporation's balance sheets.
'hile programs for training accounts and audit personnel in improved
accounts procedures and the introduction of more uniformity through
manuals were undertaken, it could not be the objective of project
personnel to undertake the required actual preparation and
verifications of accounts book for financial years when the project
did not even exist.
(b) The undertaking of more expanded primary procurement activities.
Although staff training and detailed procurement plans were prepared
for every procurement season, nonavailability of the required funds
always allowed partial execution only. Unless necessary financial
resources are available to NFC in time, these operational objectives
are difficult to achieve.
(c)  The reduction of existing deficits of NFC.  Despite a wide range of
cost reduction measures, it will be impossible to significantly
reduce NFC losses as long as the corporation is asked to sell
foodgrains at prices requiring subsidy but receives no cost-covering
replenishment. The maintenance of an expensive but underutilized
marketing network also contributes to these financial results.
Unless required actions able to solve these problems are
forthcoming, NFC will continue to accumulate financial losses.



- 23 -
(d) The improvement of staff discipline and interest in work and good
performance. Despite training and professional orientation and
encouragement, it was outside of project influence to change the
existing working environment. Lack of incentives, limited powers
given to managements for solving staff matters along operational and
commercial requirements are the main reasons for these prevailing
attitudes which do not permit to operate NFC along the necessary
efficiency standards.
Project Committees
4.52      The Management Support Unit within NFC and headed by a Deputy
General Manager was established in time. Its existence secured clear respon-
sibility allocation and became, thanks to tnie interest and qualifications of
the officer-in-charge, the decisive instrument for project coordination and
problem-solving. Cccurring delays were mostly caused by factors outside the
decision-making authority of this unit.
4.53      In connection with tender evaluation and technical decisions, the
board of NFC appointed a technical subcommittee which, in collaboration with
the PEU, became responsible for preparing all technical recommendations which
the board had to pass in connection with project implementation. The forma-
tion of such a committee on the one hand caused another time-consuming process
and consequent coordination problems and delays but on the other hand assisted
the PEU in getting technical recommendations more easily approved by the board
after having been sanctioned by the committee. Project staff also benefited
from local experience and observations of committee members apart from the
fact that decisions taken were shouldered by another independent component.
4.54      The DCA provided for the formation of a Project Management and
Coordination Committee. This committee was formed and held 11 meetings
between November 5, 1980, and August 18, 1984. In 1981, following the
transfer of NFC, the chairmanship moved from the Secretary, Ministry of
Agriculture, to the Secretary, Ministry of Supplies. Although the formation
of such committees theoretically appears fairly valuable for establishing
necessary coordination as well as transparency of project activities, in
practice it proved of little assistance and mainly caused coordination
problems for arriving at meeting dates. The main shortcoming which had been
overlooked in its formation was the fact that the PMCC did not possess any
legal or executive powers, which all were vested in the board of NFC. Hence,
PMCC recommendations carried little weight unless approved by the board of
NFC. Hence, when in 1984 the Secretary, Ministry of Supplies, also became the
Chairman of the board of NFC, the grotesque situation emerged that decisions
taken under his chairmanship of PMCC could be defeated under his chairmanship
of the board of NFC. As a result, PMCC meetings stopped after August 1984,
and the whole decision-making process was undertaken by the board of NFC.
Marketing Studies
4.55      All three marketing studies were prepared by APROSC.  At the time,
they closed existing gaps and provided detailed material in relation to food-
grain production, marketing, processing and government policies and opera-



- 24 -
tions. The weakness of the studies was that they relied mainly on data from
governmental entities whereas information from the private sector, marketing
and processing over 952 of the foodgrains, was scarce and based on relatively
small oamples. The reports also have a trend towards theoretical analysis and
explanation indicating that the professionals ir,volved lacked practical opera-
tional marketing experience. On the basis of these studies, APROSC later on
conducted a Food Policy Seminar during which the main issues and findings were
discussed with 79 policymakers and marketing personnel in Kathmandu from
August 30-31, 1984.
IDA Support
4.56      IDA supported the project and provided advice and guidance in the
form of missions or through the local World Bank office. Records show the
following project missions:
Date                               Purpose                     Participants
October/November 1973        Identification Mission
May 1979                     Assistance to Preparation Report
October/November 1979        Staff Appraisal Report
September/October 1981       Supervision Mission                         1
October 1982                 Supervision Mission                         1
April 1983                   Supervision Mission                         2
October 1983                 Supervision Mission                         1
April 1984                   Supervision Mission                         1
December 1984                Supervision Mission                         1
October 1985                 Supervision Mission                         2
January 1986                 Supervision Mission                         1
March 1986                   Supervision Mission                         I
April 1986                   Project Completion Report                   1
4.57      Support, guidance and understanding of the IDA personnel involved in
project supervision was generally appreciated as helpful and constructive.
Apart from communication difficulties causing some delays, financial proce-
dures also worked satisfactori'y.
4.58      Shortcomings can be noted in regard to the SAR report where
construction plans, cost calculations and time schedules were significantly
out of line, later creating problems during project execution. The lack of
clear guidelines in regard to price escalations and tender procedures which
considered EMG regulations and provided adequate examples from other similar
projects was one of the main reasons for delays or for causing the deletion of
essential equipment.
4.59      Despite the shortcomings and delays on the part of HMG/NFC, the
abrupt cancellation of Phase III and setting of a project termination date by



- 25 -
telex without any on-the-spot assessment definitely lacked courtesy and diplo-
matic approach by IDA. This revealed a degree of insensitivity for local
counterpart staff which a reputable institution should not permit.
4.60      This project demonstrates the need to include in the project
preparation process, professionals who can prove that they already have suc-
cessfully executed this type of project under the working conditions of a
country such as Nepal. The use of consultants and IDA staff who do not have
this experience will always result in the risk of omissions and wrong
judgments which later on hamper project implementation.
4.61      IDA, in financing such projects in developing countries and with
counterparts who have never gone through such an experience, will have to make
sufficient provisions for the required learning and coaching process. This
also includes close project monitoring during critical project phases, e.g.,
tender awards or construction periods, in order to avoid lapses such as
between March and October 1985. Telex messages and aide memoires alone did
not provide the required support. A more active and interested role of local
,World Bank offices should be enlisted for such tasks. The question whether
project objectives and better services to the envisaged target groups have to
be more highly rated than the problem of overcoming administrative, time
schedule and financial difficulties arises quite clearly from this project.
This in the end touches matters of policy, operating approach and final
objectives of IDA.

V. INSTITUTIONAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
5.1       Apart from the development ot physical and technical facilities,
being a precondition for improved foodgrain marketing operations, the Grain
Storage Project also aimed ats
(a) restructuring existing government-controlled marketing
organizations;
(b) structural and organizational improvements of NFC for strengthening
its operations;
(c) arrangements for increased primary procurement of foodgrains by NFC;
and
(d)  establishing adequate financial standards and resources required for
efficient marketing operations at NFr.
Project performance in these fields was as follows.
Integration of Rice Export Companies
5.2       Appointment of NFC as RECs' managing agent took place in 1980.
Thereafter, the integration of qualified REC personnel into NFC and other
government organizations was arranged and wherever appropriate REC stores and
offices were utilized by NFC. This operational integration process was
completed in 1983.
5.3       HNG appointed three liquidators for assessing REC assets and for
providing recommendations for their utilization. This process is completely
outside the control of the NFC board and management. Final HMG decisions and
the required legal procedures are still awaited.
5.4       In 1984, HMG formed two commercial export and import companies at
Birgunj and Biratnagar which employ former REC staff and utilize former REC
offices. Both companies are suppose to undertake export and import activi-
ties, particularly of essential commodities, on behalf of HMG. They operate
under the supervision of the Ministry of Supplies. IDA has been assured by
HMG that these companies will not be involved in foodgrain marketing activi-
ties.
Organization of the Nepal Food Corporation
5.5       The latest organizational position of NFC is shown in Annex 8 (Orga-
nizational Structure), Annex 9 (NFC Offices), Annex 10 (Storage Facilities)
and Annex 11 (Transportation System).
5.6       During recent years, with the active participation of the Management
and Organization Advisor, NFC management and board undertook steps towards
streamlining and strengthening the corporation's organizational structure.
Major changes were:



- 27 -
(a) the nomination of the Secretary, Ministry of Supplies, as Chairman
of NFC, thus smoothing coordination between ministry and
corporation;
(b) the formation of a separate Procurement Division reflecting the
attention NFC has to give to primary procurement oparations;
(c)  the formation of a Technical Services Division, giving the necessary
impex.s to the quality control operations and the technical
activities of NFC;
(d) the strengthening of the Internal Audit Division by putting it
directly under the General Manager and board, thus turning it into a
more effective tool for controls; and
(e) the extension of the tasks of the Planning Division by including all
follow-up, evaluation and training responsibilities.
At the same time, programs started for improving relationship and coordination
with the field office managers.
5.7       At present, NEC employs 1,050 staff members (1978179, 806), 833 or
79.32 at field offices and 217 or 20.7Z at its Central Office. Detailed staff
analysis revealed the following key data:
(a) Education Standard
3.02 Doctorate or Masters Degree holders
11.1? Bachelor or Diploma holders
14.12 Intermediate or Certificate Level
21.12 School Leaving Certificate (SLC)
25.3? attended school or are literate
25.42 Illiterate
(b) Salary Scale
39.02 Grades I and II
53.42 Grades III, IV, V
7.62 Grades VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI and Special
(c) Years Employed with NFC

43.5? 1 to 5 years
13.3? less than 1 year

More than 5 years           22.1             39.4             25.6
(e) Education Related to NFC Work
62.82 of personnel with academic background
55.22 of intermediate and certificate level
16.3? of all NFC personnel.
5.8       These data show that NFC operations have to be conducted with per-
sonnel to 71.8Z possessing an educational background of SLC or lower and
employed to 92.42 in salary scales of Grade V and below. Of the staff members
with intermediate or academic studies (28.22), only 58.92 studied subjects
related with NFC work while of the total NFC staff only 16.32 possess a
professional educational background.
5.9       Under such a manpower structure, advice to NFC management to improve
performance is easier to give than to implement. Hence, technical assistance
support in the first instance had to be geared towards assisting NFC in devel-
oping basic professional understanding at the personiiel levels executing day-
to-day operations (storekeepers, accounts staff, etc.). Preconditions for
further improvements are dependent on such efforts. Together with the adop-
tion of better management methods, these investments slowly show results.
5.10      NFC, however, still faces the difficult tasks of improving the
required discipline, professional interest and attitude to responsibility of
many of its staff members in order to reach the necessary operating standard
for a marketing organization. The task to overcome these shortcomings which
can easily be identified but only slowly rectified is interlinked with the
overall development of the country, the moral standard set by its leadership,
existing labor and HKG regulations, etc. Hence, it is illusionary to expect
that within the span of existence of a project all requ.LL=%&. improvements can
be achieved.
Primary Procurement of Foodgrains
5.11      One of the main project objectives is the development of technical
and organizational preconditions, permitting the setting up of an alternative
marketing system for the benefit of the farmers through a more active partici-
pation of government-linked marketing organizations in the primary procurement
of foodgrains. This objective is still valid. The envisaged Food Production
and Marketing System is shown in Annex 12. It is complemented by the Strategy
of Keeping Foodgrain Reserve Stocks for Food Security in Nepal (see Annex 13)
as pursued under present HMG and NFC policies.



- 29 -
5.12      The project plans anticipated for 1985/86 a procurement of 136,200
tons of foodgrains through NFC utilizing the Sasha cooperatives as buying
agents. Actual procurement of foodgrains by NFC were, however, far below
these expectations:

Development of foodgrain production in Nepal and in the Eastern and Central
Regions where the storage facilities of Phases I and II are now available is
shown in Annex 14 for the period 1979/80 to 1984/85.
5.13      For each year, NFC prepared a procurement plan.  In 1984, systematic
training of field personnel commenced together with the preparation of
detailed work plans for procurement activities discussed and approved in work-
shops by the NFC managers from the procurement areas. In the 1984/85 procure-
ment season, NFC opened procurement stations in all production areas including
the hill belt demonstrating that, with proper arrangements, the minimum price
can be defended. Similar arrangements are under way for 1985/86.
5.14      Although NFC attempted on a larger scale to enter in primary pro-
curement operations, so far, the following obstacles could not be overcomes
(a) The lack of sufficient financial resources on the part of NFC and
only limited and sometimes delayed financial support from HMG.
Unless adequate funds under the control of NFC become available,
effective procurement operations will not be forthcoming.
(b) The absence of sufficient storage facilities in the production areas
of the Terai, so far creating a risk for countrywide large-scale
commitments dua to technical bottlenecks.
(c) The problem of adequate financial resources on the part of the
envisaged buying agents, the Sajha cooperatives. Most of them are
rated as not creditworthy by the Agricultural Development Bank.
Attempts by NFC to provide advance financing to some Sajha
cooperatives mostly ended with a negative experience.
1/ The Agricultural Projects Service Centre contends that many local
cooperative institutions have sufficient storage facilities (Attachment,
para. 2(iii)).



- 30 -
It appears doubtful that even with the new storage facilities, NFC will be
able to perform the envisaged primary procurement function unless the critical
financial aspects are properly sorted out.
Financial Performance of NFC
5.15      The weakest point in the evaluation of NFC is its financial
performance and state of accounts. This has been severely criticized at
project beginning and throughout project accompaniment and still remains a
major problem at project termination. Financial statements in the form of
Trading, Profit and Loss Accounts and Balance Sheet are shown for the
financial years 1974/75 to 1984/85 in Annex 15.
5.16      A comparison between the projected NFC deficits of the appraisal
report and the corporation's actual financial performance for the years
1980/81 to 1984185 arrives at the following results (in NRs'000)s

5.17      The demand set by IDA that annual NFC deficits resulting from HMG
distribution policy are to be financed annually by HMG with the beginning of
the fiscal year 1982 has only partly been implemented. So far, NFC received
the following subsidy payments from KMG:
1981/82: NRs 69,103,000
1982/83: NRs 79,900,000
1983/84: NRs 32,442,000
1984/85: NRs 44,000,000



- 31 -
As shown by the financial statements, these subsidies were not sufficient for
covering all losses NFC sustained when executing HMG foodgrain distribution
policies.
5.18      IDA resources received through HMG and assets acquired under the
Grain Storage Project have not yet been incorporated into NFC accounts books
although NYC management intends to do so starting with the financial year
1983184. Audited project accounts until 1983/84 are completed and submitted
to IDA. Auditing of accounts for 1984/85 and the period July 15, 1985, to
March 31, 1986, will be undertaken within the time frame as prescribed in the
Development Credit Agreement.
5.19      It is without question that financial operations of NFC are not yet
up to a standard which can be expected from a commercial marketing organiza-
tion. The problematic points to be tackled are:
(a) The need to operate NFC under its own corporation act which deter-
mines by far more clearly among other things the financial
obligations and procedures. The present Corporation Act No. 23 of
1964 (2021 BS) does not specify a deadline for the submission of the
annual balance sheet.
(b)  The completely outmoded preparation procedures of the balance sheet
still requiring physical weighing of all stocks at all offices have
to be adapted to more efficient methods.
Cc) NFC management must be granted the necessary executive powers for
establishing the required staff discipline and efficiency. Transfer
of trained officers to differing activities should be reduced.
Sd) NFC management and accounts standards must be able to provide all
required marketing cost data and accounts data without undue delays.
(e) Existing NFC deficits have to be resolved and the corporation must
be given the chance to undertake operations on a sound financial
basis with adequate funds of its own, permitting timely marketing
actions.
(f) Prevailing supply of subsidized foodgrains to accessible hill areas
should be replaced by a market intervention policy at NFC cost
prices, reducing present losses on those activities.
(g) For corporation services, such as the supply of foodgrains to remote
food-deficit areas, which require HMG subsidy, a refunding system
has to be arranged, guaranteeing a timely payment of such subsidies
at cost-covering prices to NEC. The same should apply to any other
marketing function NPC performs under HMG policies and directives
which may result in losses.
(h)  Control by HMG to ensure proper financial standards at corporations
such as NFC.



- 32 -
5.20      During the last two years, the technical assistance component con-
centrated on laying the necessary professional foundation for required changes
in the accounts sector. Experience showed that after adequate professional
orientation, NFC personnel was capable of performing its functions properly.
Conditions for operating the inventory accounts system, for stock-taking at
stores, etc. have been established and understood. It is now up to NFC man-
agement and board to implement the possible operational changes and ensure the
discipline required for their execution.
5.21      With the installation of a computer unit and the available software
program for monitoring field reports and data, even latest tools for manager-
ial control are now available to NFC. Latest trends indicate that under
present management the right track has been found, giving hope that all the
investments start paying off and lead to more efficient operations within NFC.
However, the solution of the corporation's finances remains an urgent matter
which HKG cannot avoid to resolve whether sooner or later.

VI.  ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.1       Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the Grain Storage Project was
estimated at 182. Calculations were based on savings in storage losses from
an estimated 7.51 to 1.62 and on savings in operation costs of about
US$140,000 per year, reaching total annual cost savings of US$1 million.
6.2       By April 1986, none of the storage facilities had been completed
and, from the total project of 40,000 tons, 27,000 tons or 67.52 will be
constructed. Costs for the entire project increased as follows:
Estimate          Actual           Increase
(NRs/ton)        (NRs/ton)           (Z)
With technical assistance             2,410             3,583             +48.7
Without technical assistance           2,146            3,161             +47.3
Such a situation was considered unlikely during project evaluation.
6.3       In the absence of actual operational data from these new storage
facilities, latest economic aEsessments arrive at the following calculations:
(a) Savings in rent and operational costs as calculated in the Appraisal
Report amount for the five places included in Phases I and II to
NRs 1,287,900 per year. This amount has to be increased by the
savings in office rents for Hetauda, Janakpur, Lahan and Birtamod
(Bhadrapur) amounting in 1984185 to NRs 82,234.38. However, these
estimated savings in operational costs of NRs 1,370,134 will be
negatively influenced by the absence of weighing equipment at these
storage sites.
(b) In regard to the reduction of grain storage losses, it has to be
noted that after proper training and orientation of the storekeepers
and their personnel which NFC conducted with the support of the
technical assistance component, actual product losses in Terai
stores during the last two years did not exceed the 2.5Z mark and
fluctuated between 0.751 to 2.52 for rice and wheat. Hence, actual
reduction of grain losses which can be directly attributed to the
construction of the new storage facilities will be in the range of
2.5Z (present maximum) to 0.752 (achievable) = 1.75Z. Calculated
for stocks of 18,090 tons (27,000 tons capacity used to 672) and a
product price of NRs 4,500/ton (rice basis), a maximum saving of
NRs 1,424,588 per year can be anticipated.



- 34 -
tc) Hence, latest annual savings gained through the investment of
NRs 85,346,282 for 27,000 tons of storage space amount to
approximately NRs 2,794,722 per year or 3.272 of the capital
invested. If the technical assistance input and a reduction of
grain storage losses from 7.5Z to 1.6Z is assumed, annual savings
amount to NRs 6,173,029 or 6.382 of NRs 96,753,282 investment.
6.4       Main benefits of the project, provided it will be properly utilized,
are now seen ins
(a) The advantages to the farmers by offering an alternative marketing
channel which ensures at least the minimum price. Usually, the
small farmers who cannot defend themselves and possess little
marketing know-how are the main beneficiaries of such developments.
(b) The stabilizing effect on consumer prices through the possibility of
the government to maintain sufficient stocks of foodgrains,
releasing them at cost-covering prices when market fluctuations
occur. It is mainly the low-income consumer who benefits from the
availability of such a market mechanism.
(c) The improvement of food security for the country through the availa-
bility of suitable storage facilities which allow safe storage of
such reserve stocks from one production year to another and
provision of immediate relief in case of calamities.
(d) The opportunity to undertake export arrangements for foodgrains in
case of surpluses from well-located and techn.tcally equipped storage
centers.
6.5       It is planned that these new godowns will be mainly utilized for the
primary procurement of: late paddy rice from November to February (80X) and
wheat from April to May (202). Due to reduced losses when storing paddy rice,
milling arrangements will be made in relation to internal market demand and,
whenever feasible, reserve stocks will be maintained in the form of paddy
rice. Depending on internal market requirements and prospects of the forth-
coming harvest, stock turnovers, utilizing export opportunities, are anticipa-
ted to take place from September to November, thus creating space for new har-
vest supplies. Whether the stores are actually utilized in this manner will
depend on the ability of HHG to gear its policy and NFC operations towards
full exploitation of these marketing improvement opportunities.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions and Perspectives
7.1       The main objective of the Grain Storage Project was to assist EMG in
the implementation of its foodgrain policy by providing good storage facili-
ties and strengthening the management and technical capabilities of NFC, thus
improving existing foodgrain marketing infrastructures and the efficiency of
marketing operations as well as reducing quantitative and qualitative storage
losses.
7.2       Measured on these project objectives, actual project output in
storage construction resulted in shortcomings such as:
(a) the construction of only 27,000 tons of storage capacity out of
40,000 tons planned;
(b) the deletion of Phase III in areas where such infrastructure
improvements would have been required;
(c) construction cost increases for Phases I and II of 94.52 and imple-
mentation delays of two years; and
sd) the absence of weighbridges and weighing equipment at all storage
sites.
Good quality of construction, suitable site layouts, as well as extensive
local staff training remained the major positive points.
7.3       Envisaged inputs of the training and technical assistance component
were implemented and yielded a number of positive results. However, their
full exploitation was reduced due to delays in the availability of storage
facilities and constant financial difficulties on the part of HMG and NFC,
inhibiting more expanded marketing operations and developments of NFC.
7.4       Original objectives in marketing improvement are still valid and
feasible once the delaying obstacles have been overcome. However, it is
fairly evident that effective implementation providing the anticipated wene-
fits to farmers and consumers can only materialize if the financial precondi-
tions have been established.
7.5       Hence, the construction of stores cannot be seen in isolation.  If
their proper utilization has to be achieved, further considerations about the
provision of required financial sources for conducting the foodgrain marketing
activities will become necessary and should commence in due course.
7.6       Initial calculations for a foodgrain price stabilization scheme for
farmers and consumers in Nepal, developing envisaged price stabilization
stocks of 28,000 tons and thus making proper use of the storage capacity con-
structed by the IDA project, on the procurement basis of: 2,000 tons of
maize; 8,000 tons of wheat; and 18,000 tons of rice (milled) or 28,570 tons of
paddy rice arrive at total financial requirements of US$7,302,684 or
nIs 153,356,381 when considering the 1986 price level and an exchange rate of
US$1 - NRs 21.00.

7.7       Financial arrangements which ensure the allocation of funds under
clearly defined conditions direct to NFC are recommended. The operation of a
separate account, which can be annually audited and assessed, could offer
sufficient security and control in regard to proper utilization.
Lessons Learned
7.8       On the part of IDA, the major lessons which can be learned from this
project are:
(a) that appraisal and project preparation missions should consist of
persons who possess practical experience in implementing this type
of project under the conditions prevailing in countries such as
Nepal, thus ensuring adequate consideration of local difficulties
and reducing misjudgments;
(b) time schedules should consider earlier experiences with similar
projects and allocate sufficient attention to the required learning
and coaching process for local institutions involved in project
execution;
(c) specific attention has to be paid to the rules of local tender pro-
cedures. Where the lowest bidder has to be preferred, adequate
guidelines for evaluation criteria have to be determined beforehand,
securing that bids which are outside given criteria will not have to
be entertained (see weighing equipment tender of project);
(d) prequalification of contractors on the basis of their reference
lists only, without checking background and actual performance,
proved to be of little value;
(e) the mobilization time of one month for contractors was insufficient.
At least three months should be granted;
(f) a mobilization advance to the contractor, under a satisfactory bank
guarantee, should be available up to the range of 252;
(g) for essential materials, such as cement, steel, etc., a price esca-
lation clause should be included in the contract. The price basis
and the reference price to be used should be determined in detail,
thus allowing clear evaluation procedures;
(h) IDA monitoring during critical project periods (tender allocation,
construction) should be intensified by utilizing local World Bank
offices for on-the-spot information, thus avoiding communication
problems as experienced during this project; and
(i) when specifying coordinating committees, etc., adequate attention
has to be paid to checking that setups like this posseds the
required legal and executive authority, which enables them to
implement their decisions.



- 37 -
7.9       For HMG/NFC, the project provided the following lessons:
(a) to ensure, before signing the project and the credit agreements,
that time schedules, cost calculations and specified commitments are
in line with realistic possibilities of execution;
(b)  to note that, despite having been treated with high priority on HMG
side, this project had to encounter the described delays and
shortcomings. This shows that the existing regular evaluation
meetings at ministry level are still weak in their executive and
problem-solving approaches. The existence of a highly qualified
central decision-making body should be considered for cases where
executing agencies have problems in arriving at timely decisions or
where the decision can affect HMG position (e.g., doubtful tender
awards, price escalation, reimbursing losses due to devaluation,
etc.). This unit could become effective whenever such cases of
emergency occur requiring qualified and quick decisions;
(c) the fact that given commitments on the part of HMG/NFC were only
partly or not fulfilled shows the need for closer monitoring of all
tasks to which HMG committed itself when entering into such loan
agreements. Checklists, to be controlled and verified in each
evaluation meeting at ministry level including the allocation of
clear responsibility for task execution, could be of assistance;
(d) projects such as the development of foodgrain marketing infrastruc-
tures and operations have to be treated in an integrated approach.
This implies establishing of preconditions which allow the executing
marketing organization to perform its duties efficiently and in a
professional, commercial manner. The present financial situation of
NFC does not permit the implementation of such an operations
strategy;
(e) HHG/NFC communication with IDA was weak. It appears more beneficial
for project execution to always involve the loan agency in the
solution of problems and execution difficulties encountered.
Unnecessary protocol and pride should have no place in the process
of achieving project objectives; and
(f) efficient project execution depends on interested and dedicated per-
sonnel. A system, rewarding personnel involved in crucial stages or
after satisfactory job completion, could stimulate the required
interest in the work and be an incentive for good performance.

Dear Mr. Donaldson,
Ref.: NePal Grain Storage ProJect (Credit 1062/NEP) ProJect
Ouletion RPort.
After going through the Peport I found that the mission has very
honestly axoepted saw weak spots of the project right from begirning
to the completion of the project.  Aepting the mistakes requixes lot
of crage which I appreciate, hoping lessoms learned will be useful
in the future.
14y caments on the PRport are nmo  in the procurement aspet and
are as follows:
(i)  one of the  ieportant aspect in project justification remined
to be primary pr rnt   of foodrain.   This could not take
place more effectively for mwy reasons which also contibted
for the lower benefits of the project.
(ii) Sajha (co-operatives at thi grassroot level) were the institutions
envisaged to procure foodgrain directly from the farmers. Neither
fund was available      with   these    Saha institutions   or a
sound organizational and mnagement structure was defined for
the purpose. This seriously haxpered the procurement programme.
(iii) Many Sajha  injstitutions  in the Tarai have  sufficient storage
facilities, funded and constructed under the Asian Development
Bank's loan, which are size and locatimn-wise strategically located
for tie operation of procuement programe.  Therefore, I have
some researvatiQos about the ostacle mentioned in para 5.14(b).
(iv)  In the abeen,e of effective and desired level of primary procurement
programme, NFC procured much of foodgrain long after  the harvest
