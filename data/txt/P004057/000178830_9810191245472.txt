KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE KYONGJU TOURISMI PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a project to provide the infrastructure
required for a new tourism complex near the City of Kyongju. In its first
stage covering a period of 10 years, the Bomun Lake resort would be developed
for 3000 hotel rooms. The project includes provision of water and sewerage
systems for the resort area and the City of Kyongju, construction of a
multipurpose dam and a small irrigation system, provision of electricity
and telecommunication facilities for the resort area, construction and/or
re-alignment of access roads to historical sites and provision of training
facilities for hotel personnel,
ii.       The number of foreign visitors to Korea has increased on average by
33% annually between 1966 and 1972, the rate of growth accelerating in the
later years. This has been mainly due to the great increase in foreign
vacation travel of the Japanese, who constitute the major part of all visi-
tors to Korea. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism are still small (US$75
million in 1972, about 4.6% of the total value of commodity exports), but a
major increase of these earnings should be possible in the next decade.
iii.      The principal destinations of foreign visitors to Korea have been
Seoul and Busan, because of limited accommodation in other parts of the coun-
try. To meet the prospective growth of tourism demand, the Korean authorities
selected the area surrounding the City of Kyongju as the priority area for
national and international tourism development. Kyongju, the capital
for one thousand years of the prosperous Silla dynasty, is one of the best
known historical cities in northeast Asia, characterized by magnificent
cultural remains. Because of its historical and cultural importance, Kyongju
has been a center for domestic tourism for many years (there were more than
1.5 million domestic visitors in 1972) but the number of foreign visitors,
although increasing rapidly, is still small (only 76,000 in 1972). This does
not reflect lack of interest on the part of foreign visitors, but the lack of
hotel accommodation. A Master Plan for the development of the Kyong-u area
has been under implementation since 1971 and mucii has already been achieved.
As part of this plan, a site has been selected outside the City of Kyongju,
on Bomun Lake, to provide for the expansion of suitable accommodation for
foreign visitors in an attractive setting.
iv.       The site of 1,040 hectares is ample for development of the resort,
including necessary ancillary facilities such as a shopping center and
traditional Korean-style restaurants and recreational amenities (sports
grounds, marina and a golf course). The development of the new resortwould
also make possible the  provision of certain  improvements to the City of
Kyongju and the existing villages close to Bomun Lake. These improvements



- ii -
include expansion of the water supply system and the provision of a sewerage
and solid waste disposal system for the City of Kyongju, and the provision of
rural water supply, environmental sanitation, electricity and streets for
five existing villages, plus the construction, furnishing and equipment of
an elementary school for the villages. Because of the major infrastructure
investments in the project area, the incremental costs of the village improve-
ments are relatively small. A multi-purpose dam would be built to control
flooding, stabilize the water level in Bomun Lake, and supply water for the
resort area, the City of Kyongju and the villages and for a small irrigation
project.
v.        The estimated total project cost is US$50 million, with an
estimated foreign exchange component of US$21.0 million, or 42% of the
total. Proposed Bank financing of US$25.0 million would cover the foreign
exchange component and provide US$4.0 million for local cost financing.
vi.       Major civil works contracts would be awarded following international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. If major civil works
contracts were to be won by foreign bidders, the foreign exchange component
for civil works contracts would be about US$9.1 million. It is estimated that
about US$5.5 million in direct foreign exchange would be required for purchase
of equipment, materials and supplies, and for foreign consultants. With the
exception of consultants, all these items would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding.
vii.      Responsibility for constructing the project would rest with five
Government agencies. The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) would
build the Duck-Dong Dam and the related irrigation works. The Kyongju City
Government (KCG) would be responsible for construction of water supply,
sewerage and solid waste disposal systems of both the City itself and the
Bomun Lake resort. The Korean Electric Company (KECO) would construct and
operate the electricity facilities of the project. The Ministry of Communica-
tions (MC) would install and operate the telecommunications facilities. The
Kyongju Development Office (KDO) would be responsible for implementation of
all the remaining infrastructure works included in the project. After cons-
truction, KCG would operate and maintain the dam, the water, sewerage and
waste disposal systems, and all project roads; ADC and the Farmers Land
Improvement Association (FLIA), or another organization acceptable to the
Bank, would operate and maintain the irrigation works; and a new entity, the
Kyongju Tourism Agency (KTA), would operate and maintain all public areas
within the resort and would lease and/or sell sites and facilities to private
investors. The KTA would be established not later than January 1, 1975; its
structure and policies would be subject to Bank approval. Overall coordina-
tion of the project would be provided by the Secretariat for Economic Affairs
in the Office of the President of the Republic. The Bank would enter into
project agreements with ADC, KCG and KECO.
viii.     The justification for the proposed investment in infrastructure
and buildings is the expectation that it will be able to attract relatively



- iii -
large numbers of foreign visitors over the 25 years of the project's economic
life, and that private investors and hotel companies will be prepared to
build hotels and other tourism facilities there. When fully operational in
1984, the project would provide employment for about 5,400 workers in the
'notels and 1,500 in other facilities of the resort. Indirect employment may
amount to 10-15,000 persons. The economic rate of return is estimated at
18.5%.  Net foreign exchange earnings are estimated at US$8.1 million in 197h
and US$66.4 million per annum by 1984, when all of the 3,000 roams are expec-
ted to be in full operation.
ix.       It is proposed that the Bank's loan should cover half of total
project costs, The balance would be provided mainly through budgetary
allocations. It is also proposed that the investment ir. tourism facilities
should be recovered by the investing agencies over the ecbnomic life of the
project together with a reasonable rate of return. Charges for utilities
should yield a reasonable return on net fixed assets in operation and ensare
financial viability through the maintenance of a satisfactory debt service
coverage. Charges for irrigation water would be in line with charges levied
in other Bank-supported irrigation projects in Korea.
x.        The project is suita'ble for a Bank loan of US$25.0 million equivalent
for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of seven years, The loan
would be made to the Republic of Korea.






KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE KYONGJU TOURISM PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1971 the Government of Korea requested Bank assistance in the
development of tourism. A tourism sector review and project identification
mission visited Korea in May 1971 and concluded that the Kyongju area (some
400 km to the southeast of Seoul) offered the most promising prospects for
attracting greater numbers of visitors to Korea and inducing a longer stay
per visitor. An important aspect of the Kyongju area's potential is its
cultural and historic attraction for, and close proximity to, the rapidly
growing Japanese market. The Government was already engaged in the prepara-
tion of a Master Plan for the urban and touristic development of Kyongju, on
the basis of which it was possible for the Korean authorities, assisted by
Bank preparation missions, to formulate a tourism project suitable for Bank
consideration.
1.02      The project would provide infrastructure (roads, water supply, sewer-
age, electricity, telecommunications) for development of an lnternational
tourist resort designed for 3,000 hotel rooms, plus related infrastructure
improvements in near-by areas, and facilities for training of hotel personnel.
The project also includes a multipurpose dam and a small irrigation project.
1.03      Due to its complexity, the project was about two years in prepara-
tion by the Korean Government and its consultants. For the same reason, an
unusual number of Bank staff were involved in its evaluation. The appraisal
mission, consisting of Messrs. Vera (Chief of Mission), Calkins, El Maaroufi,
Hechtenberg, Jacob, Iizuka, Krippl and Saravanapavan, completed its field
work in April 1973. The dam and irrigation components were evaluated by an
earlier mission comprising Messrs. Golan and Scherich (Consultant). Legal
aspects were reviewed in the field by Mr. Amerasinghe, and desk evaluations
of electricity and telecommunications were made by Messrs. Maeda and Satnar.
1.04      This would be the first Bark loan for tourism in Korea,
2. BACKGROUND
A. The Economy
2.01      Korea has achieved an exceptional expansion in most sectors of
economic activity since the mid-1960's.  During the Second Five-Year Plaa
(1967-71), real GNP increased at an annual average compound rate of 11.5
percent. The major factors responsible for rapid growth during this period
were a high level of investment and an extremely rapid rise in exports.



-2-
During 1971-72, a levelling off of exports and stagnation of investment caused
a decrease in the rate of growth of GNP. However, a revival in the growth of
exports and fixed investment has caused a sharp revival in the economy. GNP
which increased at 7.1 percent in 1972 has 1een expanding at the rate of 14-15
percent in 1973.
2.02      Korea has been faced with the problems of financing rapid growth.
This has caused it to rely heavily on foreign inflows of capital and has also
led to aomestic inflationary pressures.  In both these respects, there have
bee:n improvements during the last year. The Government's stabilization efforts,
particularly the measures taken in August 1972 to stop inflation and to mode-
rate the disruptive impact of the slowdown on Korea's industrial sector, seem
to be working successfully to bring about a more favorable environment for
stab.e growth. Two parallel goals are to strengthen the industrial structure
and to correct urban/rural income disparities through increased agricultural
development.
2.03      The Government plans to pursue vigorously its long term targets of a
per capita income of $1,000 and exports of $10 billion by the early 1980's.
Substantial foreign borrowing would be needed to meet the resource require-
ments of the plan; in view of the expected rapid growth in exports, it appears
likely that Korea could support the debt service requirements of such a
borrowing program.
2.04      The Kyongju Tourism Project will contribute towards the Government's
goals in several areas. Among these are rural development through the dam
and irrigation component of the project, increased employment and incomes
in the Kyongju area, which is among the poorer parts of the country, and
significant increases in net foreign exchange earnings on services account.
B. The Tourism Sector
2.05      Korea's major tourist assets are its many sites of historical and
archaeological significance, its scenic beauty, and its proximity to a major
tourist-generating market, Japan, with which it has cultural, historical and
increasing economic ties (Annex II).
2.06      Despite these advantages, tourist traffic to Korea was very small
unti.` recent years,  Korea was not on established travel routes for European
ama merican vacationists visiting the Far East or on Pacific tours. Until
the  .ast few years its facilities for foreign visitors were very limited
with only a few hotels of international standard in the capital, Seoul. Lit-
tle had been done to develop the country's cultural and historical attractions
for; the foreign visitor, and international transport links were not well devel-
one"-, Visitor numbers were few, averaging only 42,000 annually in the mid-
l?us. About one-1-4alf of all foreign visitors in those years were Americans,
maz-y of whom, were on business or official duty.  Among non-American visitors,



-3-
Koreans resident ill Japan who were visiting their families in Korea accounted
for a large proportion. There was little real vacation traffic.
2.07      This situation was dramatically altered with the great increase in
foreign vacation travel of the Japanese over the past several years. Total
foreign visits by Japanese to all destinations increased from 212u000 in 1966
to 1.4 million in 1972 and most of this increase was in vacation travel. A
growing share of this total has gone to Korea (from 8% in 1966 to 16% in 1972).
2,08      Foreign visitor arrivals in Korea increased on average by 33%
annually between 1966 and 1972, and the rate of growth accelerated in the
later years. Arrivals jumped by nearly 60% ir. 1972, and the number of
Japanese visitors in that year was more than double the level of 1971.  Growth
trends are shown in Annex II and summarized in the table below:

2.09      Japan now constitutes the major source of all vistrors to 'Korea
(almost 60%). The very rapid increase in foreign travel b,y Japanese recct6
the growing economic prosperity of Japan, the contirnued liberalization of
overseas travel restrictions since 1964 and the recent realignmer.ts of



-4-
_oreign exchange rates.  The recent improvement in communications between
Korea and Japan has been a factor in enabling more of the estimated 500,000
K~oreans resident in Japan to visit their homeland.
2.10      Both the private sector and the Government have responded to the
opportunities off e-ed by the growth of the Japanese travel market. Hotel
capacity in certified hotels 1/ has increased by 40% in the last two years,
from 49500 rooms in April 1971 to 6,300 rooms in the Spring of 1973.  As the
.2oreign visitor flow is rather even throughout the year, with low points only
_n tna winter months of January and February, the hotels maintain high annual
occ;pancies.  With the fast growth of tourist traffic, investment in new
az;v^mmodation capacity offers attractive financial returns (para. 4.10). Some
300 additional hotel rooms are planned to be built during the next two years,
prinLcipally in Seoul and Busan, the main entry points for foreign visitors.
rhzse new hotels will be financed primarily by private investors.
2.tV      To keep pace with the growing number of visitors, most of whom arrive
by air (91.4% in 1972), air services of both the Korean national airline and
foreign airlines have expanded rapidly with the number of international flights
increasing from 2,300 in 1966 to 11,440 in 1972. Seoul's Kimpo International
Airport is currently being expanded to accommodate jumbo jets, and the reloca-
tion of Busan's existing airport to an area which will permit its expansion
is under consideration. Busan is now linked with Shimonoseki (Japan) by a
thrice-weekly ferry service; plans are in hand to increase the frequency of
this service and to develop new sea charter services between Japan and Korea.
2.i2      With the prospects for continued rapid growth in Japanese foreign
travel and with the aim of attracting a greater share of this market to Korea,
taIe Government has taken a number of measures to promote the development of
tne tourist industry. Recognizing that the ancient former capital of the
country at Kyongju could become a major point of interest for foreign visitors,
the Government organized the preparation of a development plan for that area.
.Lz is currently preparing, with USAID assistance, a comprehensive national
-ourism study to establish the framework for the longer-term development of
zhe sector. In addition, it is promoting the preparation of a Master Plan
for the development of Cheju Island, whlich has major tourist assets and is
ecnsidered an area of high priority for tourism development. The Government
.;as established an Industrial Rationalization Fund for Tourism with assets
W 2.6 billion (US$6.5 million) which will make medium-term loans available
-o private investors for improving existing hotels and other tourist facili-
.e& or building new ones.  The Government provides incentives to hotel inves-
zrs in the form of customs duty exemption on imported materials and a tax
£l.iday on corporate income in the first five years of operation. With assis-
ance from UNDP and ILO, the Government is promoting a tourism training
?rogram to expand tae output of qualified personnel for the industry.
*/ Tahe Bureau of Tourism issues a certificate to hotels which it considers
meet the standards required by foreign visitors.



-5-
2.13      The main responsibility at the Government level for the sector rests
with the Bureau of TourisT, a department of the Ministry of Transportation.
The Bureau's staff has until recently been snall and it has lacked the author-
ity and resources to push throughi a major development program. Hence, in 1972,
a special section was set up in the Office of the President of the Republic
to provide greater impetus to and more effective coordination of the efforts
of government agencies in developing tourism.
2.14      Though tourism in Korea is at an early stage, and its contribution
to foreign exchange earnings is still relatively small (US$16.2 million in
1966 and US$75 million in 1972 or 4,6% of the value of commodity exports),
a major increase in the number of foreign visitors to Korea and in foreign
exchange earnings derived from tourism should be possible in the next decade.
Because of its proximity to Japan, its comparatively low price level and its
cultural and historical remains which are of particular interest to the
Japanese, Korea should be able to attract a significant share of the growing
Japanese foreign travel market. In addition, a greater proportion of Europeans
and Americans who visit Japan in order to see Kyoto and Nara may be induced
to go on from there to Korea.
3. THE PROJECT
A.  Background
3.Gi      The city of Kyongju, located about 70 km to the north of Busan
(Maps t and 2) was the capital of the Silla dynasty which ruled over the
southeastern portion of the Korean peninsula from 58 B.C. to 668 A.D. and all
of Korea from 668 A.D. to 935 A.D. At its height, Kyongiu had close to a
million inhabitants and, with its elaborate palaces and monasteries, was the
country's major artistic and cultural center. The town is now rather small
(100,000 inhabitants) and undistinguished, but many cultural, artistic and
religious relics of the Silla period can be found there. On the edge af the
town is a cluster of Silla and Yi dynas'y remains:  an observatory built in
634 A.D. which is the oldest of its kind in Asia, royal tombs and shrines,
temples and pagodas.  A short distance from Kyongju, on Mount Tohai, is the
Bulguk Temple, famous for its 25-foot golden Buddha datiag back to the e;ighth
century, and the Sokkuram Cave Temple with its exquisite stone buddia and
sculptured stone friezes.  The Cave Terzple is located at _he top of 21ouent
Toham with magnificent views of the surrounding hills and of the sea beyonu,
On the other side of the city is Mount Namsan where fifty-lLve temple sites.
some thirty-eight stone pagodas and many royal tombs have oeen d_scovered,
3.02      With its historical and cultural importances Kyongju 'has been
a center for domestic tourism for many years. The city has attracted more
than a million domestic visitors in each year since 1967; iin 1972 they
numbered 1.5 million. Many of the historic remains, despite their Cultural



-6-
importance, were long neglected and fell into decay.  In late 1970, however,
as part of a national program of cultural renovation, the Government estab-
lished an inter-ministerial planning group charged with the formulation of
an overall plan for the restoration and preservation of the historic sites
at Kyongju and for the city's urban and touristic development. The Kyongju
Development Office (KDO) was set up and work began in 1971. Much has al-
ready been achieved. The largest and most famous temple (Bulguk) has been
completely restored.  Measures have been taken to preserve the Cave Temple
and protect the royal tombs. A new museum is being built. Access to the
sites has been greatly improved with new roads and expanded parking spaces.
All of these steps have served further to enhance Kyongju's position as the
counrcry's pre-eminent cultural and historic center.
Though the prime motivation for the restoration and preservation work
Z-t Kyongju has been to foster the Koreans' interest in and knowledge of their
c_-ure and history, the Government realized that with suitable additional
fiacilities the area could also become a center of attraction for foreign visi-
:ors.  The number of foreign visitors to Kyongju, though increasing rapidly,
is still small - only 76,000 in 1972. This mainly reflects the lack of
suitable accommodation, with only two hotels comprising 142 rooms (3-star
category) presently certified by the Bureau of Tourism as suitable for
foreign visitors.
3.04      To provide for the expansion of suitable accommodation in an attrac-
tive setting, the Korean authorities selected a site outside the city where
there would be space for a large-scale resort, with a first stage of 3,000
hotel rooms. The site, covering about 1,000 ha, is located on an artificial
lake (Bomun), 6.5 km from Kyongju City, in an area of great natural beauty.
The area has a temperate climate, favorably influenced by a mountain range
to the east of the city. The mountains provide a substantial degree of pro-
tection from typhoons and consequent floods which are common on Korea's east
coast. In addition, the mountains cause some light precipitation during the
drv years which are frequent in the region.
3.0.5     Development of the new resort could not proceed without making pro-
vision also for improvements to the city of Kyongju and the villages close
zo Bomun Lake. The resort development is expected to bring about a substantial
increase in the local village population, while the expansion of foreign and
donestic tourist traffic to Kyongju and Bomun Lake will make great demands
on the city's services which will accordingly have to be strengthened.
B. Planning and Environmental Aspects
^-wCo     The Master Plan for the Bomun Lake resort area is based on the
°Lourism estate" concept.  Under this concept, utilities, services and certain
'- dings would be provided by the estate as common facilities.  The bulk of
_;le available land area would be subdivided into individual lots for the



-7-
construction of hotels as well as recreational and commercial developments
by private investors. Ptivate development activities would be guided by
physical and financial controls, which would be established and enforced by
an estate management agency (Annex VIII).
V
3.07      By attracting and concentrating a large number of hotel developments
in one defined area as opposed to haphazard locational decisions of individual
investors, planning and installation of both on- and off-site infrastructure are
simplified and less costly. At the same time, financial costs to hotel inves-
tors for land acquisition and utility investments are substantially reduced.
The estate concept benefits the visitor population by making provision ror a
high level of quality control in regard to environment, services, antertain-
ment, and tourist activities; and also the local population, by establishing
a regulated relationship between visitors and the local community.
3.08      The area available for development around Bomun Lake amounts tc about
1,040 ha. most of which has already been acquired by the Government. It is
envisaged that over a twenty-year period, this area would be developed to
provide approximately 6,000 hotel roams plus condominia, apartment buildings,
youth hostels and camping facilities. The present project relates, however,
only to the initial stage designed for 3,000 hotel rooms.
3.09      The first stage of the development (Map 3) envisages a ring road
around the lake and a street network inside the complex, hotel sites parallel
to the shore, an amenity core, recreational facilities, a golf course and
club house, and sites for traditional restaurants. The amenity core has been
planned as a complete community center and would comprise buildings and spaces
for a tourism center, a day-care center and playground, shops, community faci-
lities such as a fire station, a health clinic and a police station, ana an
administration building. Zoning regulations will require that the height and
volume of hotels and other buildings would harmonize well with the s.urrounding
lands and vegetation, and that the spatial distribution of structures would
provide from many points views towards the lake, hills and mountains. The
land use plan for the Bomun Lake resort would be finalized by consultants in
a form satisfactory to the Bank and su_table development controls (such as
the above-mentioned zoning regulations) acceptable to the Bank would be
established to ensure its effective implementation.
3.10      Despite its substantial size, the proposed development is expected
to have almost no negative environmental effects. The present levels of waver,
air and noise pollution in the Bomun Lake area are relatively low. 'The area
is free from air pollution with the exception of occasional odors which
originate from exposed sludge in the lake when the water level Zs low.  TXhis
problem would cease when the water level of Bomun Lake would be sc.abilized
by the new Duck-Dong Dam.  The water of Bomun Lake is at present slightly
polluted by silt and other organic materials due to wash-offs from agriculzural
areas and the relatively high mineral content of the water from. the mountain
streams which drain into the lake. Since the Duck-Dong reservoir would act as
a sedimentation basin for the mountain waters and since no rice fields will be



-8-
cultivated in the area, the water pollution level is expected to decline
substantially. A small amount has been included in the loan for the purchase
of two boats and spraying equipment to control the growth of algae on the sur-
face of Bomun Lake and the Duck-Dong reservoir. In addition, the sewage treat-
ment plant for KyongJu would substantially reduce the current level of pollution
of the Hyung San River, especially near the city's existing water supply
intake.
3.11      The development of a sizeable tourism resort at Bomun Lake would
create several thousand additional jobs and would, therefore, generate a
s_.grificant increase in the demand for housing in the area of Kyongju.  Part
of this increase is expected to be met through the normal expansion of housing
by the private sector. In order to insure, however, that adequate housing is
ava-lable in the project area, the Government has given special priority to
Kyongju in the disbursement of subsidized housing funds through the Ministry
of Construction. Land for such housing will be provided through land-reclama-
tion under way near the Iyung San River, with utility services extended to
the area by the Kyongju City Government (KCG).
C. Project Description
3.12      The project would consist of the following elements listed in more
detail in Annex I:
(a)  a dam at Duck-Dong and a small irrigation system in
the Bulguk area (Map 2);
(b)  water supply, sewerage and solid waste disposal systems
for the City of Kyongju and the Bomun Lake resort area,
and a rural water supply system and environmental sanita-
tion improvements for five adjacent villages;
(c)  electrical supply system for the Bomun Lake resort and
electrification of five adjacent villages;
(d) access roads to historical monuments and to the Bomun Lake
resort, a secondary road and street network within the
resort area, tourism infrastructure and common facilities
at Bomun Lake, street improvements and an elementary school
for five adjacent villages, and a hotel school;
(e)  telecommunications facilities for the Bomun Lake resort; and
(f)  a feasibility study of a potential new tourist area on
Cheju island.
A multipurpose dam would be built at Duck-Dong, upstream from the
;esent Bomun Lake, to create a reservoir which would enable stabilization



of the Lake level at Bomun. 1/ In addition, the reservoir would provide,
in the long term, water supply not otherwise available for the tourist resort
and for the increasing needs of the city of Kyor.gju, Inasmuch as about
1,227 ha of agricultural lands are presently being irrigated from the Bomun
Lake, the new reservoir would continue to provide water for this purpose,
but it would also enable irrigation of an additional area of t,200 ha for
which an irrigation system would be constructed as part of the project.
The principle crops to be grown or, the newly irrigated land would be rice,
barley, potatoes and other vegetables.  A detailed description of the Duck-
Dong Dam and the irrigation project is given in Annex IV. Appropriate opera-
ting rules would be formulated to regulate the priority uses of water in case
of shortages, and adequate administrative arrangements would be made to ernsure
the enforcement of these rules. The operating rules would be submitted for
approval by the Bank within one year of the date of the proposal loan.
3.14      In the short term, particularly during the period when the dam
is being constructed and the reservoir is filling up, it may be possible
to rely on ground water to supply the Bomun Lake resort area, and appropriate
exploration is now under way. If this exploration proves successful, grouad
water would be a more economical eolution in the early years of the project.
In the long term, however, demands for water at Bomun and in Kyongju would
require that the two water supply systems eventually be linked. Should
ground water not be available in sufficient quantity and quality to meet
even short-term demands, then the two systems would need to be linked in
time for the first hotels at Bomun to be served by water pumped from the
new treatment plant at Kyongju. Given the rather limited availability of
water from the existing Kyongju City water supply system, however, it would
also be necessary to construct a separate water treatment plant at the
Duck-Dong reservoir in order to meet the full development needs of the
Bomun Lake resort area. Provision for this treatment plant has been in-
cluded in the project; should sufficient quantities of ground water be
available, of course, the treatment plant at Duck-Dong and possibly the link
with the Kyongju City network, could be postponed, with the resultant savings
utilized to extend the distribution network in the project area.
3.15      The sewerage systems for t-ae Bomun Lake resort area and the city of
Kyongju would be interlinked, and a common sewage treatment plant near Kyongju
is envisaged. Consultants are to review the preliminary design, and this is
likely to result in a recommendation for low-cost, aerated lagoons iLncluded
in the project.  The liquid effluent, after chlorination, would be piped in,to
the Hyung San river downstream from the new water supply intake, At prsent
Kyongju City has no sewerage system and the river has become polluted near
the existing water intake.
1/   207 families will be displaced by the new dam.  The Government is ,ro-
viding funds to re-settle the families elsewhere.



- 10 -
3.116     The solid waste disposal systems for the Bomun Lake resort area
and the city of Kyongju would include the collection, segregation and disposal
of solid wastes in sanitary fill at selected areas of Kyongju. Eight new
collecting trucks would be procured under the project. The water supply,
sewerage and solid waste disposal components of the project are described
in greater detail in Annex V.
3A7       The electricity component of the project is discussed more fully
in Annex VI. The new substation would be located between the city of Kyongju
anz the Bomun Lake area and be connected to the existing 154-KV transmission
l,.ne from Ulsan to Pohang with a 9.5 km-long line.  Distribution in the resort
area is proposed to be accomplished partly by overhead lines and partly by
unaerground cable.
The project also provides for the construction and/or realignment
of four roads totalling about 23 km in length to provide access to various
historic and scenic sites and four roads with a total length of about 22 km
to provide major access to and within the resort area. In addition, a
secondary road and street network of some 12 km is envisaged within the resort
area itself. The specifications of the roads as to width of pavement and
shoulders differ, but are based on expected traffic flows and physical
planning considerations. The roads included in the project are shown in
M4ap 2 and further discussed in Annex VII.
3.19      The tourism infrastructure and common facilities to be constructed
at Bomun Lake include storm water drainage networks, environmental sanitation
of the Lake basin, earthworks along the Shin Pyong River, community facilities
(an amenity core and a service core), an 18-hole golf course and clubhouse,
landscaping of the resort area and surroundings, and lighting for the resort
area roads and streets.
3.20      A hotel school designed to accommodate about 250-300 students
is included in the project. It would consist of a 30-room hotel with all
teaching facilities including a language laboratory. Provision is also
made for hiring expatriate staff as may be necessary. Justification for
including this component in the project is based on the existing lack of hotel
training in the area and on the projected manpower needs of the hotels (Annex
:11, Table 2). The ILO has expressed willingness to assist the Korean author-
-ties in devising an appropriate training program and in recruiting teachers.
(Korean authorities will, within six months after the proposed loan is made,
summit a training program for approval by the Bank.
3.21      The telecommunications component of the project provides for con-
struction and equipping of facilities for the Bomun Lake resort comprising
about 900 telephone lines, telegraph and telex facilities and fax and sub-
scr-bers' trunk dialing (STD) facilities.
3 22      In connection with the development of basic infrastructure for the
_ozun Lake resort area, it would be possible to provide for a number of
i=provements which would raise the standard of living in five adjacent villages



- 11 -
at relatively small incremental costs. These improvements would consist of
rural water supply, environmental sanitation, electrification and street
lighting, street improvements, telephone connections and a small elementary
school which would serve all five villages. The villages involved are Buk
Gun, Son Gok, Chong Dan, Chun Gun and a traditional Silla village which the
Government intends to restore and open for tourists who wish to see folk arts
and sample traditional Korean food.
3.23      The island of Cheju is situated at a point 400 km southwest of
Busan and 450 km west from Shimonoseki. Because of its mild climate during
the winter months and its attractive beaches, the island offers considerable
potential for international tourism. The Government intends to develop a
tourism resort in Cheju, similar to the one proposed for Bomun Lake. The
project includes the preparation of a feasibility study for such a resort.

3.25      While the August 1972 stabilization measures aim to keep the
inflation rate at 3% and have been reasonably successful thus far, provision
has been made for an annual price increase of 7% in building, sitework and
equipment costs during the construction period. The 7% price increase
assumed is below recent trends, which until August 1972 averaged about i0% per
year. In addition, an allowance of 15.3% of the construction, siteworks and
equipment costs has been made to cover physical contingencies. This is
reasonable since most of the cost estimates are based on semi-detailed
engineering studies and on reliable cost data for similar works in the area.
The details of the allowances made for price and physical contingencies are
shown in Annex I, Table 1.7. The provision for contingencies amourts to
24.8% of base line costs or 18.9% of total project cost.
3*26      An allowance of 10.6% of the civil works and equipment costs has
been made for professional services required in the final design and super-
vision stages.  This is high by Korean standards, but is appropriate in ths
case in view of the specialized consulting services which will be requitred
for the final design and/or supervision of certain components (golf course,
landscaping, sewerage, dam and irrigation, and physical planning) of the
project to supplement the services already provided by the Government's
Korean and Japanese consultants. It is proposeea that the final design por-
tion of the cost of these consulting services which began on May 1, 1973
(about US$750,000) 1/ be financed retroactively from the proposed loan.
E. Project Execution
3.27      Five Government agencies would be responsible for execution of the
major components of the project, assisted by consultant architects and
engineers acceptable to the Bank. The five agencies are: (i) the Agri-
cultural Development Corporation (ADC), a serai-autonomous public entity
within the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery; (ii) the KRyongju City Govern-
ment (KCG); (iii) the Korean Electric Company (KECO), a corporation partly
owned by the Government; (iv) the Kyongju Development Office (KDO), which is
a department of the Ministry of Const.luction (MDC); and (v) the Ministry of
Communications (MC).
3.28      The activities with respect to the project would be coordinated at
the operating level by a project unit which is to be established within KDO
and which would include engineers, an architect, a procurement officer,
accountants and other staff.  The appointment of a full-time head for the
project unit, acceptable to the Bank, would be a conditiorn of 1oan effective-
ness. Overall coordination would be provided by the Secretariat for
Economic Affairs in the Office of the President, whicl hias effectivJely
coordinated work completed so far and to which !DO reports directly, as
as to the Ministry of Construction.
1/   This represents 1.5% of the total project cost.

3.29      The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) would be responsible
for the design and construction of the Duck-Dong dam and the related irriga-
tion works. ADC has gained experience on two Bank-financed projects, the
Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project and the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project,
but will still require some assistance from consultants in designing and
implementing the dam and irrigation component of the proposed project. Final
des-gns for the dam and irrigation works would be approved by the Bank.
3.30      The Kyongju City Government (KCG) would be responsible for the
design and construction of the water supply, sewerage and solid waste dis-
posa. component of the project, with the assistance of consultants agreed to
by the Bank.  Final designs for the water supply, sewerage and solid waste
disposal systems would be approved by the Bank.
3.3i      The Korean Electric Company (KECO) would be responsible for the
design and construction of the electricity component of the project. The
project would be a very small part of KECO's total system expansion and the
company is well qualified to carry out the project. Final designs for the
electricity component would be subject to Bank approval.
3.32      The Kyongju Development Office (KDO) would be responsible for the
aesign and construction of all the remaining infrastructure works included
in the project. KDO is an effective organization capable of executing its
part of the project, but will require some assistance from qualified consult-
ants. Final designs for the works to be carried out by KDO would be sub-
mitted to the Bank for its approval.
3.33      The telecommunications facilities would be carried out by the Min-
istry of Communications (MC), but would not be part of the package of works
to be financed from the Bank loan.
3.34      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that ADC, KCG, KECO,
KDO and MC would complete the preparation by March 1, 1974 of a critical path
network acceptable to the Bank for carrying out all parts of the project and
that the network would be reviewed internally by all parties concerned at
least monthly. The results of such reviews would be communicated to the Bank
on a quarterly basis.
F. Financing Plan
3.35      The total estimated financial requirements of the project are
Won 20.0 billion (US$ 50.0 million equivalent). It is proposed that the
Bank s loan should cover half of total project costs.  The balance
woauld be provided mainly through budgetary allocations of the Government.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government would
meet any cost overruns and would make arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
to provide capital funds for the project as and when needed.

3.36      The consolidated financing plan for the Project, excluding interest
during construction and working capital, can be summarized as follows:

/2   Including contingencies.
The Government has indicated that its contributions would ne made in the
form of budgetary allocations with no fixed repayment terms. The proceeds
of the Bank loan would be made available to ADC, KCG, KECO and K00 on
terms appropriate for the particular project components to be financed.
Details of assumptions made for financial forecasts are included in the
respective annexes for these project components.
G. Lending Arrangements
3.37      The proposed loan of US$25,0 million would cover the foreign ex-
change costs of the project estimated at US$21.0 million equivalent and would
provide about US$4.0 million for local currency financing (approximately 13.8%
of the total local currency costs of the project). These estimates reflect



- 16 -
the expectation that about US$9.1 million of major civil works contracts (out
of a total of US$30,0 million for all civil works) would be won by foreign
bidders, and that most equipment suppliers would be foreign. Should local
manufacturers win all equipment supply contracts, the local expenditure financing
from the proposed Bank loan might increase by about US$6.5 million to US$10.5
million. ADC, KCG and KECO would receive portions of the Bank loan on the
basis of subsidiary loan agreements to be concluded between each of these
agencies and the Government and to be approved by the Bank,  The Bank would
enter into separate project agreements with ADC, KCG and KECO which would
s,_ecfy the obligations of each of these agencies with regard to the project.
Commitments relating to the project components to be carried out by KDO and
MC have been included in the draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the
Government of Korea.
H. Procurement
3.38      Major-civil works and equipment contracts would be awarded under
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank guidelines.
Project items would be grouped to the extent possible in order to encourage
suc-h competitive bidding, but domestic bidders would also be able to
bid on individual items. Bid packages were agreed during negotiations.
The proposed project is within the capacity of the Korean construction
wndustry to implement, but it is expected that foreign contractors would
submit bids for the larger contracts. Some smaller contracts (e.g., the civil
works of the water supply and sewerage component, Bomun Lake earthworks and
waterworks, improvement of existing villages) would probably be too small to
attract foreign bids. It was agreed during negotiations that these contracts,
each not to exceed US$50,000 in value, would only be advertised locally. The
total value of such contracts is estimated at about US$2.8 million equivalent.
3.39      Responsibility for advertising requests for tenders, issuing tender
documents, evaluating bids and awarding contracts for all project components
would rest with the Office of Supply of the Republic of Korea (OSROK) which
.s the central procurement office for all Government agencies. The various
executing agencies, assisted by consultants, would, however, retain responsibil-
'Lty for the technical aspects both in the preparation of tenders and in the
szvaluation of bids.  In evaluating bids, domestic preferred manufacturers of
sj_pment and furniture would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the
c.l.f. costs of competing imports or the prevailing level of customs duty,
w.nichever is the lower.
I. Disbursements
-l ~10    Disbursements from the Loan Account would cover:  (i) 55% of total
cos. of civil works and associated services, excluding land acquisition;



- 17 -
(ii) 100% of foreign expenditures or of the ex-factory cost of locally-
manufactured equipment, furniture and materials; and (iis) 100% of foreign
expenditures on technical services for the feasibility study of Che4u Island.
Any savings on purchases of equipment would be utilized by increasing the
percentage financing of civil works.  Retroactive financing of up to US$75000GO
would be allowed on account of expenditures for consulting services made afto:
May 1, 1973 (see para. 3.26). Disbursements would be made for certain works
carried out at Kyongju and Bomun Lake by ADC, KCG, KECO and KDO (Chart 1). In
addition, relatively small amounts would be disbursed for the hotel training
program for which the Bureau of Tourism would have operatiozal reaeon6ibility
and for the Cheju Island feasibility study for which the Ministry of Trans-
portation would be responsible. The astimated schedule of loan disbursements
is shown in Annex I, Table 3.1. Applications for disbursement would be sub-
mitted by the government-authorized agent within each of the organizations
in order to speed up disbursements, with copies sent to the Economic Planning
Board.
4. JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Demand
4.01      Evaluation of the probable growth in foreign visitor traffic to
Kyongju necessarily begins with an assessmenLt of the   ikely growth in Japanese
foreign vacation travel.  TDe extraordinary increase in vacation travel from
Japan over the period of 1968-1972 (with an average annual growth rate of
almost 60%), the continued rapid growth of the economy, and the macor chanaes
in the exchange value of the yen over the past two years all point to a
further rapid expansion of the Japanese foreign travel market (Az=ex 1II
Table 4). Japanese vacation travellers abroad are estinated to n-umber more
than 1.4 million in 1973 and to increase to about 10 mialion by 1980, 1/
Though large in absolute terms, the latter figure implies a growth race (35%
p.a.) little more than half that rea.-ized in the past five years.
4.02      The number of Japanese going to Korea more than doubled from 1971 to
1972 (96,500 vs. 217,300); this figure represerted about 16% of total Japanese
foreign travel in 1972.  0f the Japanese visiting KGorea more than 33, are
vacationers. Over the next decade  the proportion of Japanese vacazion :istors
going to Korea is projected to decline slowiy (from 16% of the :o:al in a 72
to about 11% in 1980), reflecting primarily tihe expectation that w:LiL rising
incomes in Japan more people wili be able to visit more distant deztinaation.
1/   A comparison with Britain is illuminating.  Despite marked di f rE  
the similarities between the highly industrializedc9 urbanized and zla-
tively affluent island societies of Britain and japani pzovide some basis
for such a comparison.  In 1972, out of the total British population of
52 million, about 8.5 mill-ion went abroad on vacation.  For a Japanese
population exceeding 100 million and with a per capita income substantially
above the British, even the projection of 10 million foreign vacationers
in 1980 might prove rather conservative.



- 18 -
4.03      While the Japanese will supply most of the vacation visitors to
Korea in the foreseeable future, continuing growth is expected in the number
of vacation visitors from the U.S. and other countries (Annex II, Table 10).
In total, vacation visitor traffic to Korea is projected at about 1.3 million
in 1980 and at 1.7 million in 1982.  This implies a growth rate of 23% per
year, as compared with 50% per year in the period 1966-1972.
4.04      Within the country, Kyongju is expected to become at least for a
number of years the principal center of interest for foreign visitors after
Seou'. Transport connections with Seoul and Busan by railway and the new
exressway are good. At present foreign visitor traffic to Kyongju is limited
by the lack of tourist amenities and particularly accommodation. With the
development of the Bomun resort and the provision of other amenities in the
area (including the golf course) 1/, the number of foreign visitors to Kyongju
(boca day and overnight visitors) is expected to increase from 76,000 in 1972
vo 233,000 in 1976 and 1.2 million in 1982. The number of foreign visitors
staying overnight in Kyongju is projected to be about 116,000 in 1976 and
800,000 in 1982 (Annex II, Table 12).
4.05      Even with the provision of a variety of tourist attractions apart
from the cultural and historical sites, it is expected that the average length
of stay of foreign visitors to Kyongju will continue to be quite short. At
present, for those visitors staying overnight, the average length of stay is
alout 1.5 days; it has been assumed conservatively that this would rise to
1.7 days in 1982.
4. 6      The flow of Japanese travelling abroad has been rather even through
the year, as has also been the flow of foreign visitor traffic to Korea.
With moderate seasonal fluctuations, a rather high average room occupancy
rate at the Bomun resort can be assumed; this has been projected at 50% in
the early years of the resort, rising to 75% by 1982. Average double oc-
cupancy has been estimated at 1.6.
4.O7      On the basis of the above estimates of visitor numbers and assump-
tions of length of stay and occupancy factors, the number of rooms required
to accommodate foreign visitors in the resort would be 600 in 1976 and 3,000
_n t982.  The average daily expenditure has been estimated to be about US$43.00
for overnight guests and US$10.00 for day visitors, in 1973 prices.
B. Hotel Development
-606      The Government projects the build-up of hotel capacity at Bomun
ake as follows:
1/    oli has become an increasingly popular game in Japan where there are
now estimated to be roughly 20 million active participants, a number
aqua-ed only in the U.S. Golf is, however, an expensive sport in Japan
where land close to metropolitan centers is scarce and very costly.
Thus, the provision of golfing facilities at Bomun is considered a major
potential attraction.



- 19 -
Year                  Hotel Rooms
1973                           0
1976                         600
1979                       1,500
1982                       3,000
At the same time there will be further development of hotels of lower categories
in Kyongju city designed mainly to serve domestic tourists. The Government
expects that there might be about 1,500 rooms in hotels of these categories by
the early 1980's.
4.09      It is expected that a number of the hotel investments at Bomun would
be made by joint ventures of Korean and Japanese investors.  Such joint ven-
tures have already been responsible for developing several of the largest new
hotels recently completed or now under construction in Seoul. Considerable
interest has been shown by both Japanese and Korean investors in the Kyongju-
Bomun area, but no binding commitments have yet been made.  This could not be
expected at the present stage of development of the project, since the master
plan for the resort has just receintly been finalized and work on implementing
the project has not yet started, However, the prospects for hotel investmelnt
are considered favorable in view of the good market possibilities of the area
and the relatively high profitability of hotel operations in Korea.
4.10      A projection of the gross operating profits .or hotels in the Bomun
Lake resort area is given in Annex III, Table 1. According to these estima-
tes, the gross operating profits on 3,000 hotel rooms when the resort is in
full operation would result in a return of about 21% on the capital invested
in hotels, after allowing for the charges to be made for utilities and other
services to be provided at the resort. 1/ After deducting land-lease paymen.ts
and depreciation charges, the return on capital invested would amount to about
17%. 2/ The return on equity, of course, would depend both on the capital
structure of the investor and on the terms and conditions of debt financing;
on any reasonable assumption regarding terms and conditions of loans, however,
the return on equity should prove attractive.
4.11      In addition to the favcraule environment for investment, the general
concept of the project is expected to be attractive to investors. Prospective
hotel developers will find a carefully-planned area with all infrastructure
provided, with adequate zoning and controls over neighboring developments,
and with common amenities provided such as the golf course, shopping centcr
and marina. These are expected to prove significant attractions.
l/   The basis on which utility and service charges would be levz-'ei iLecit&
in paras. 5.11 and 5.13 and in Annexes V and VI.  Land-lease charges ara
described in para. 5.21 and Annex VIII.
2/   Government regulations also provide for a five-year income tax holieay
as an incentive to hotel investments (see para. 2.12).



- 20 -
412       Nevertheless, the risks involved in starting a new resort are greater
thar. expanding one already established.  Most hoteliers are understandably
reluctant to be alone in a new resort. One of the primary functions of the
proposed resort operating agency, therefore, would be to encourage hotel
investments at the Bomun Lake resort through promotional efforts and through
the development of land lease and sales policies designed to attract qualified
private investors. Since the economic viability of the proposed infrastructure
investment program would depend essentially on the timely development of hotel
accomodation, agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government
wouid take all necessary steps to ensure that the minimum number of rooms
reju red for the economic viability of the project (estimated to be 1,600)
would be in operation by Decembert 1982.
C. Economic Justification
Economic Returns
4.13      The gross benefits resulting from the tourism-related component 11
of the project are taken to be only the expenditures made by visitors in the
Kyongju-Bomun Lake area. Although some portion of the (net) revenues of
international and domestic transportation of these visitors is properly
attributable to the project, this has not been taken into account in the
calculation of project rates of return. The relevant costs include the
capital and operating costs of the infrastructure provided under the pro-
posed project, plus the capital and operating costs of hotel accommodation
and related superstructure in the project area such as restaurants and
entertainment facilities.
4.14      With an estimated economic life of the project of 25 years, the
economic rate of return on the tourism-related program of investments would
be 18.5%. (It has not been found appropriate to use shadow pricing of labor
or foreign exchange in calculating the economic return.) It has been assumed
that foreign investors would be interested in developing hotels at Bomun
(para. 4.09). Assuming that one half the hotel rooms would be financed from
abroad, the rate of return on the purely domestically financed investment
(Uicluding tile Baink loan, but excluding both the foreign private investment
and the net repayments and other returns accruing to foreigners) would be
2O07%. This is because foreign hotel investors would not participate in
t-hose benefits of the project arising from tourist expenditures outside the
ho.-zs and would receive an after-tax return on their investment somewhat
;/  The tourism-related component includes the site development and infra-
structure works for the Bomun Lake Resort complex (including the access
roads to various monuments), plus the costs of hotels and other super-
stru.cture. This component represents over 90% of the total program of
investments. The two additional project components are the utilities
outside of the Bomun resort area and the irrigation component, described
in the following paragraphs.



- 21 -
lower than the project's overall rate of return - thus raising the share and
the rate of return accruing to domestic capital (including the Bank-financed
portion). As the returns both on the overall project and on the Korean funds
invested in it (including IBRD funds) are quite satisfactory, the project is
acceptable under any reasonable assumption about its impact on foreign capital
inflows into the Korean economy (see Annex III, para. 12), The rate of return
would be sensitive to changes in several project variables, as shown below:
Sensitivity Testing                       Resultant Rate of Return (%)
Mi)  Investment cost + 10%                            17.1
+ 20%                           15,9
(ii)  One-year delay in opening                        17.4
Two-year delay in opening                        16.4
(iii) Gross operating profits of hotels
and related facilities
(a)  +10%                                19.9
(b)  -10%                                17.0
4.15      The development of the Bomun Lake resort on a planned and integrated
basis will help avoid the disfigurement of the area by uncontrolled and
unsuitable structures and the higher social costs which would result from
haphazard development. As these benefits are quite difficult to quantify,
they are not reflected in the rates of return shown above.
4.16      In addition to the Bomun Lake resort facilities, the project includes
investment in water supply, sewerage and solid waste disposal systems for the
city of Kyongju and provides for some infrastructure investments in several
villages near the resort area. These improvements would constitute an
important benefit to the local population. To the extent that thris benefit
is reflected in water and sewerage charges, it has been taken into account
in the calculation of the return on she investment in utilities.  Further
details of the projected revenues and costs of the utilities are provided in
Annexes V and VI. Other benefits, such as a decrease in public healtlt
hazards or an increase in the value of properties, are difficult to quantify
in any meaningful way and have been omitted.
4.17      The irrigation component of the project includes that portion of
the dam properly attributable to it, plus the investments ir. the irrigation
system itself.  A separate justification of this component is contained in
Annex IV. The economic return on the irrigation component, assu-,i.ig an
economic life of the irrigation system of 50 years, would be 13.7%.
4.18      When the entire program of capital and operating costs in tourism-
related investments, the utilities component and the agricultural component



- 22 -
is measured against the combined gross benefits of these components, 1/ the
overall rate of return would be 16.5%.
D. Employment and Balance of Payments Effects
4.19      When fully operational in 1984, the project is expected to provide
direct employment for about 5,400 workers in the hotels and 1,500 in other
facilities of the resort. Indirect employment generated in construction,
agr: culture, handicrafts, transportation and other services, is difficult to
estimate accurately but could amount to 10-15,000 persons.
4.23      The proposed project is expected to increase gross foreign exchange
receipts by about US$8.4 million in 1976 when the first hotels open and by
US$71.0 million per year by 1984 when the project's "typical year" occupancy
has been reached. This compares with US$74.7 million in foreign exchange
receipts derived by Korea from tourism in 1972. Because of the high proportion
of foreign tourists expected to visit the area and the low import content of
operating costs of tourist facilities (10% for existing hotels in Korea),
the estimated net foreign exchange earnings of the project are relatively
high. Assuming that roughly one-half of the hotel rooms would involve foreign
ownership, and assuming that the foreign participants would fully repatriate
their projected dividends, net foreign exchange earnings, after accounting
for the foreign exchange component of operating and capital costs, and profit
repatriation, would amount to US$7.9 million in 1976 and US$62.8 million in
1984. This compares with the estimated foreign exchange component of the
proposed project of US$18.8 million including price contingencies, and the
estimated foreign exchange component of superstructure of about US$25.0
million.
5. INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Operating Responsibilities
5.01      Responsibility for operation, maintenance and administration of
the facilities to be constructed under the project would devolve upon
various agencies. The following is a schematic summary of the agencies
and their respective responsibilities (Chart 2):
Thle benefits of the public utilities component are valued at market
prices.

other appropriate Government
agencies.
ii.   Water Supply, Sewerage and    Kyongju City Government (KCG) -

Duck-Dong Dam)
iii.   Electricity Supply (includ-   Korean Electric Company

Water Drainage
vi.   Bomun Resort Facilities         Kjongju Tourist Agency (KTA)
vii.   Hotel Training                  Bureau of Tourism
5.02      Whereas ADC, KECO, MC, KCG and the Bureau of Tourism are well
established corporations or agencies already responsible for operation of
other facilities it their respective fields, the KCG Water and Sewerage
Division has just been created and KTA has yet to be created.  These two new
agencies would bear the main responsibility for ensuring that during the
operational phase adequate and efficient infrastructure services are provided
to the resort area, and that user charges in the form of utility rates,
service charges, lease rents and land sale prices are sufficient to cover
operating costs and depreciation, and provide a reasonable rate oi return
on the investments.
5.03      As far as electricity supply and telecommunications are concerned,
these responsibilities would be asstamd by KECO and MC, both of which already
operate within the framework of tariff regulations set to achieve the finan-
cial objectives of public utilities. ADC and the KCG municipal orgazniatiacn,
on the other hand, would be governed by operational and finaecial p:-nciples
consistent with the character of their investments; thesS are d scussed iL
Annexes IV and VII, respectively.
B. Institutional Arrangements
5.04      The Government is presently setting up a separate W4ater aria
Sewerage Division which would operate in accordance with sound public utility



_ 24 -
practices and would be organized and staffed as shown in Chart 3. The es-
tablishment of this new division within the Kyongju City Government has been
confirmed during negotiations.
5.05      To ensure that KCG would manage and control its water supply,
sewerage and waste disposal operations in accordance with sound public utility
principles, KCG would be required to engage management consultants acceptable
to the Bank to establish a commercial system of accounts. From January 1,
1975, this system of accounts would be implemented and independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank would be engaged by KCG to audit the financial state-
ments of the Water and Sewerage Division for the year ending December 31,
1975, and annually thereafter; these statements would be submitted to the
Bank within four months after the end of each calendar year.
5.06      The responsibilities of KDO, as an office of the Ministry of Con-
struction, are presently much wider than those envisaged for the KTA. KDO
has been responsible for the restoration of monuments, the construction of
access roads and parking spaces, river embankments and the new museum, as
well as for the development of the Bomun resort.  KDO is not expected to have
a continuing role once the present development program is completed, nor is
it in any sense a commercially-oriented organization. Hence the Government
has agreed that a new organization (KTA) would be created to own and operate
the new resort. KTA, the key staff of which would be part of the project
unit in KDO prior to the establishment of KTA, would be commercially oriented
and would be structured to provide managerial, administrative and maintenance
services within the Bomun resort area (Annex VIII and Chart 3).
5.07      KTA would be responsible for implementing a development policy
whose objectives would be:
(i) to recover, through adequate charges to the
beneficiaries, the capital and operating costs
for services provided to them;
(ii,  to exercise a lease and sales policy designed to attract
private investors qualified to provide tourist accommo-
dations and other facilities compatible with projected
tourist demand;
(iii) to prepare and implement plans for additional facilities,
buildings and improvements which are not included in the
initial phase of the project and to adjust the project
program to changing market conditions;
(iv)  to enhance the environment by guiding private develop-
ment aczivities through the application of appropriate
development controls; and
(v)  to contribute to the welfare of the local community
t'nrough regulations concerning hotel employee training



- 25 -
programs and employment policies of individual hotel
operators and through consultation with the Kyongju
City Government on matters of common concern, such as
an equitable distribution of util±ty charges between
beneficiaries in the city and the resort area.
5.08      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that a statement setting out the purpose, the organizational structure and
the development policies of KTA would be prepared and submitted to the Bank
for its approval by July 1, 1974.  Agreement has also been reached that KTA
would be established by January 1, 1975, and that the appointment of its
key staff would be made in consultation with the Bank.
5.09      KTA would be required to engage management consultants acceptable
to the Bank to establish a commercial accounting system. This system of
accounts would be implemented from January 1, 1975. Agreements were reaczled
during negotiations regarding regular audits and the submission of financial
statements corresponding to those mentioned in para. 5.05.
5.10      Inasmuch as the project would be executed and operated by various
agencies as mentioned in para. 3.24 and 5.01, working level co-ordination o.-
construction would have to be exercised by KDO. Appropriate arrangements for
submission of reports on project execution and financing by these various
agencies were agreed upon during negotiations. Such reports and state-
ments would be prepared with the assistance of qualified consultants, where
necessary, and the reports of each agency should be subject to internal and
external audits satisfactory to the Bank.
C. Financial Objectives
5.11      The basic financial objective which the Governaent would be ex-
pected to achieve in respect of facilities provided by the project 4s the
recovery of its investments in the various project components, including a
reasonable rate of return, from charges to the beneficiaries. The achieve-
ment of this objective in respect of the resort area is necessarily condi-
tioned by the ability of KTA to charge the hotels with the full capital and
operating costs of infrastructure without endangering their profitaAbiity,
which is a prerequisite for the continued operation of the hotels.
5.12      The Government would also take into account the ability of the
farmers to pay for irrigation water. This is reflected in the level of
water charges for the irrigation component which are expected to >rovice
for recovery of about 40% of the original investment at 3.5% interen otv.
a period of about 40 years.  These terms are consistent with those of 0
irrigation projects in Korea financed partly by the Bank.



- 26 -
5.13      Water supply, sewerage and electricity charges would be designed
to meet the conventional objectives of providing the utility entities with
reasonable rates of return on net fixed assets in operation and ensuring
continuing financial viability of these entities through the maintenance
of a satisfactory debt service coverage.
D. Financial Forecasts - Utility Operations
5.'.4     Financial forecasts for water supply, sewerage and waste disposal
operations of KCG are included in Annex V. These forecasts show that KCG's
Water and Sewerage Division would be able to achieve satisfactory finan-
cial results with rates of return ranging from initially 7% to about 11%
in 1982. The Division would repay to the Government its share of the pro-
ceeds of the Bank loan over 20 years with 5 years' grace at 7.25% interest.
Because of the favorable debt/equity ratio (ranging from 43% to 29% of total
capitalization) the debt service coverage would be 1.7 or better throughout
the operational period.
5.15      The main assumption made in the forecasts is the application of
water and sewerage charges which would place the burden for the extension
of services to the resort area on the hotels; this would also implicitly
include the charge for use of the dam as required for stabilization of the
lake level (see para. 3.13). The assumed water and sewerage charges for
hotels would be 2.5 times higher than those for commercial users in the
city. Details of the tariff structure assumed are provided in Annex V.
5.96      During the development period (1977-1981) the assumed direct user
charges would be supplemented by annual payments made by the Government on
behalf of KTA in an estimated amount of Won 512 million (US$ 1.29 million)
in lieu of additional direct user charges. These payments would be treated
initially as deferred expenses by KTA and would eventually be included in
the calculation of hotel charges (para. 5.23). This would ensure full
recovery of all capital and operating costs from the beneficiaries without
Government subsidies and without excessive direct user charges during the
initial period of hotel development. Financial covenants have been agreed
upon during negotiations which would set adequate performance standards
for the KCG Water and Sewerage Division to meet this objective and to allow
the Division to earn an overall rate of return on net fixed assets in
operation) suitably adjusted for changes in price levels, of 7% in the first
four years and 8% thereafter. To safeguard the Division's financial position,
the Division would not undertake other expansion during the construction of
the Bank project, and would not incur additional long-term debt without the
Banka's approval if its net revenue should be less than 1.5 times the maximum
future debt service requirements.
J.O.i7    F1'inancial forecasts for the electricity supply component of the
Pro;ec- are included in Annex VI. These forecasts show that by applying its



- 27 -
existing electricity tariffs to the consumers in the resort area KECO would
earn a satisfactory rate of return on its incremental investment, provided
that the extra cost of providing underground distribution facilities in the
resort area would be borne by KTA. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that appropriate financial arrangements between KECO and KTA would be made
for this purpose.
E. Financial Forecasts - Kvongiu Tourism Agency
5.18      The Kyongju Tourism Agency (KTA), to be established by January
1975, would administer the Bomun Lake resort. KTA would acquire title to
the land and certain facilities at the resort site and would obtain revenues
from the lease or sale of land and facilities and from annual service charges
to hotels and other establishments (shops, restaurants and recreational
facilities).
5.19      The total capital requirement for the development of the Bomun lake
resort is estimated.at US$22.72 taillion, including financial charges of US$2.32
million during construction (Annex VIII). Of the total, 48% is proposed to
come from the Bank loan, 14% from Government advances and the rest in the form
of Government equity contribution. KTA will be expected to repay to the Govern-
ment the proceeds of the Bank loan over 25 years with 5 years grace at 7.25%
interest per annum. The Government would pay the interest on the Bank loan
during the grace period. These interest payments would be capitalized by KTA
over the five-year grace period at 7.25% and would be repaid over 20 years.
These conditions would be reflected in an agreement to be concluded between
the Government and KTA when the latter is established. The terms of this
agreement would be subject to approval by the Bank.
5.20      The financial projections for KTA cover the investment expenditures
at the resort, revenues from the lease or sale of sites, the shopping center
and the golf course, revenues from the sale of services, and the expenses of
operating and maintaining such services. Details are provided in Annex VTIl,
Tables 1, 2, and 3.
5.21      Revenue projections assume that 25% of the land set aside ror hotel
sites would be sold and the rest would be leased. These projections assume an
average land sale price of US$40 per m2 and an average annual land lease
price of US$350 per room for hotels. Rents for other superstructurce esoa+i,i-
ments are projected at appropriate percentages of their expected grcss revenues.
Annual service charges are based on the projected gross operating profits of
hotels and other establishments at relatively conservative rates. Lxperience
may show that higher prices can be charged once the resort is established
5.22      The operating costs include maintenance of the infrastructure
facilities in the resort complex, promotional and administrative activities
for the resort, and a small amount (US$25,000 per year) paid to local



- 28 -
agricultural committees as rent for the use of Bomun Lake. Of these, the
major ien is maintenance costs. The promotional expenses and administrative
costs are based on agreed work programs to carry out these tasks adequately.
5.23      The Government, on behalf of KTA, would make development contribu-
tions to KECO to cover the additional costs of providing underground electricity
distribution faciliities in the resort area (para. 5.17) and to KCG to supple-
ment direct user charges for water supply and sewerage in the resort area during
the i        years of hotel development (para. 5.16).  The development contribu-
tions, cAharged to KTA, would be treated as deferred expenses by KTA and would
amount to about Won 1.4 billion. KTA is expected to recover this amount through
its ch-arges to the hotels, including the sales proceeds of developed lots,
within about ten years. Amortization of the deferred expenses over this period
is included in the financial projections of KTA (Annex VIII, Tables 1, 2, and
3).
5.24      On the basis of the above assumptions, and given the conservative
revenue projections made, KTA's financial position would be sound. Despite
some small losses in the years 1979-80, the financial rate of return (net in-
come before interest as a percentage of total net assets) reaches 7.1% by the
time full utilization of the hotels is achieved in 1984. The debt service
coverage shown in the cash flow projection is quite satisfactory.
5.25      Because of the nature of RTA's operation, the financial projections
do not represent standards of performance which can be regulated by financial
covenants such as a rate of return requirement. During negotiations agreement
was therefore reached that KTA would formulate in agreement with the Bank fi-
nancial objectives and regulations governing lease rents, sales prices and
service charges. In addition, KTA would have its accounts and financial
statements for each fiscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank.
5.26      In addition to the financial return to KTA in its operation of the
resort, the Government is expected to receive substantial tax revenues from
hotels and other superstructures. Over the period to 1998, the total tax
revenue is estimated to amount to at least US$90.0 million in 1973 prices.

Notes to cost estimate tables
1.  General Cost Estimates
The total project cost has been estimated at US$500. million. As
contingency allowances, about 9.1% of the total project cost -- or 15.3% Of the
cost of civil works and equipment -- has been envisaged for physical increases.
This is reasonable because most of the cost estimates were based on semi-detailed
engineering studies and on reliable cost data for similar work under construction
in the area. Price contingencies represent about 9.8% of the total project cost
or 16.3% of the cost of civil works and equipment, taking Into account the
domestic inflation and the inflation in countries of likely foreign supplies.
Total contingency allowances constitute about 19% of the total project cost.
The foreign exchange component, estimated at 42% of the total project
cost, is understood as the sum of direct payments made in foreign currencies fcr
building materials and equipment, consulting services and contractors, plus
estimates of the import component embodied in goods, services and royalties
that are currently paid for in local currency.
2. Detailed Cost Estimates
Tables 2.1 to 2.14 contain detailed information on base costs, contin-
gency allowances, professional services and cost of land acquisition of the
18 project components.  This information has been organized into amolnts corres-
ponding to civil works, equipment, foreign exchange component and annual a'Thcations
in accordance with the agreed schedule of implementation.

I. Present Foreign Visitor Traffic to Korea
1.        Total foreign visitor arrivals to Korea increased from 67,965 in
1966 to 370,656 in 1972, showing an annual average growth rate of 33% over
the period. The growth in 1972 was 59%. The major impetus behind these
increases has been the growth in visitor traffic to Korea by Japanese.
Through 1970 U.S. visitors were the largest group; since 1971 the Japanese
have become by far the most numerous, increasing by 52% per year on the
average and more than doubling last year.

2.        Within the total visitor traffic, vacation travel grew at an even
faster pace - an annual average rate of 50% in 1966-72; in 1972, it accounted for
56% of all visitors (and 83% of Japanese visitors) compared with 28% in 1966, while
business visitors in the same period declined from 13% to 8% of the total. "Other
visitors" showed a relatively high annual growth rate of 42% over the same period,
reflecting a greater exchange of citizens and ideas between Koreans and other
countries on a non-official level, i.e. in sports, in education, in research, etc.

haas a thrice-weekly ferry service linking it to Shimonoseki, Japan. There are
Dlans to further expand this service.  in audition, charterea vessels Degan

4.        According to Bank of Korea data, foreign exchange earnings from tour-
ism amounted to US$ 312 million -in 1971 and US$ 74.7 million in 1972.  Assuming
an avera8e five-day stay per visitor to Korea, the average daily expenditure
per tourist was about US$ 40.  However, these figures may be somewhat on the
low side since a 1972 survey by the Kyongju Tourism Development Economic Study
Team estimated average daily expenditures by foreign tourists to Korea to be
LS$ 51 for overnight visitors and US$ 17 for day visitors.

II. Future Foreign Visitor Traffic to Korea
(a) The Japanese Market
5.        To evaluate the future development of Korean tourism, iL is necessary
to assess the current trends in Japanese overseas vacation travel and its
prospects.
6.        The number of Japanese traveling abroad has been increasing at a
remarkable pace, particularly those going abroad on vacation ratF'er than
business trips.  The number of Japanese who traveled abroad (excluding those
going to Okinawa) grew by 42% on an annual average over the period of 1968-1972,
reaching 1,392,000 in 1972. Vacation travel from Japan increased imuch faster
than the overall rise, growing almost 60% per annum during the same period.
The number of passports issued for vacation trips abroad rose from 46% of the
total in 1967 to 85% in 1972 while passports issued for business trips fell
from 40% to 12% in the same period. The most popular destination for Japanese
tourists were in Asia, particularly Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea, followed by
the Pacific; namely, Hawaii and Guam. The highest growth rate was in travel
to Korea, which more than doubled from 1971 to 1972 alone.
7.        There are a number of reasons for this marked growth; the most obvious
are:
(a) the growth in the real income level of Japanese, combined
with the recent revaluation of the Yen, has greatly
increased the number of Japanese who can afford to travel
abroad;
(b) the amount of free time enjoyed by the average Japanese
worker has been increasing; many major business establish-
ments in Japan have adopted the 40-hour week; the average len2th
of paid vacation time is gradually increasing, and the
Japanese worker is becoming more like his Western counter-
part in that vacations are oftentimes taken abroad;
(c) the active role played by travel agencies in developing a
wide spectrum of tours designed to appeal to the greatest
number of people with attractive group tour prices and
simplification of travel abroad by overcoming the problem
of language, hotel arrangemernts, etc.;
(d) resort areas in Japan have become overcrowded, reaching
a saturation point and causing many Japanese to seek
vacations out of the country.



ANN- E IT
8.        As a result of these factors, Japanese vacation travelers going abroad
have risen,from 154,200 in 1968 to almost 1 million in 1972. On the basis of
the Japan National Tourist Organization's projection and studies made by
tne Japan Tourist Association, as well as discussions with the five leading
tour operators in Japan, the mission has projected the growth in Japanese
vacation travelers going abroad conservatively at 34% p.a. (little more than
half the rate realized in the last five years, 1968-1972).  On this basis,,
it is estimated that the number of Japanese vacation travelers will be 1.4
million in 1973 and will increase to 10 million1/ in 1980.
9.        An indication of future Japanese travel abroad may lie in the growth
of domestic tourism.  A JTA sample survey in 1972 indicated that 87 million
trips were made within the country with the number of annual visits averaging
1.9 per traveler and the average stay 2 nights.  Consequently, some 45 million
inhabitants could afford to make a vacation trip within the country, their
average expenditure a ounting to US$ 49 per visit or US$ 24.50 per day. If
only 20% of these tourists were able to join the ranks of those going abroad
on vacation in the next few years, the potential increase in the number of
Japanese traveling abroad would be 9 million. The current development of
overseas traffic by Japanese thus appears still to be in the primary stage.
10.       The travel industry in Japan faces a number of crucial problems,
which must be solved if the growing demand for foreign travel by Japanese is
to be met. These include the present restrictions on charter flights, the
need for expansion of airport and aircraft capacity, and the shortage of
tourist accommodations in some popular nearby destinations. Given the
pressures within Japan for greater travel abroad, the move towards more
chartered flights for Japanese appears irresistible, much like the large
chartered flight business in America and Europe. Current arrangements
between tour operators and air carriers, both domestic and foreign, are in
fact already underniming air policy based on IATA agreements which had
restricted charter development. As to expansion of physical facilities, the
Government has embarked on a major program for expansion or addition of new
international airports.  Despite the growth of accommodation in nearby areas,
the capacity of such facilities is still inadequate in some areas to accommo-
date increasing vacation demands from Japan. Japanese investors are respond-
ing to tne opportunity by building new hotels in such destinations as    Korea,
Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii and Guam. Even though in the future Japanese can
expect to travel w-ith greater ease to more distant places, for the present
the bulk of their travel is likely to be confined to places nearest to home -
the Far East, Southeast Asia, Micronesia and the South Pacific.
1/ A comparison with Britain is illuminating. Despite marked differences, the
similarities between the highly industrialized, urbanized and relatively
affluent island societies of Britain and Japan provide some basis for such
a comparison. In 1972, out of the total British population of 52 million,
about 8.5 million went abroad on^ vacation.  For a Japanese population
exceeding 100 million and with a per capita income substantially above the
British, even the projection of 10 million foreign vacationers in 1980 could
prove rather conservative.

11.       Important among these destinations will be Korea.  Relations
between Korea and Japan have been checkered by periods of animosity and
periods of relatively peaceful and beneficial interaction. The ill-feeling
and resentment to which the period of the Japanese annexation of Korea in
the first half of this century (1910-1945) gave rise are dissipating and
contacts between the two countries have been steadily improving and increas-
ing since the Normalization Treaty signed in 1965. Today, Korea has a number
of advantages over other Asian countries competing for the Japanese tourist
market:
(i) its relatively low price level;
(ii) its unique cultural and historical remains which
predate those in Kyoto and Nara in Japan and which
are of interest to the Japanese;
(iii) its proximity to Japan and the low transportation
costs involved; and
(iv) the fact that many Koreans, particularly of the
older generation, speak Japanese.
12.       Japanese tourists to Korea are drawn from several groups:
(1) Japanese school groups, who for the same cost involved in traveling from
one part of Japan to another, can visit some of the archaelogical remains in
Korea; (2) college-age students; (3) those Japanese who have been to such
places as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, etc., and who are looking for new nearby
places; (4) companies sponsoring trips for their personnel.
13.       Korea is being heavily promoted by Japanese tour operators.  What
makes this important is the fact that 97% of total air tickets sold to Japanese
is handled through tour operators (according to a Japan Airlines survey). The
price range of typical tour programs for Korea is within the economic reach of
Japanese urban workers whose average monthly earnings rose to Y 110,0001/
(US$ 410) in 1972. Following is a comparison of prices for typical Japanese
tours to popular destinations:
Price for 1973
Destination              Duration              Yen      US$
Hawaii                  4 nights/6 days        168,000   634

14.       While at the moment travel to Korea by Japanese vacationers is largely
confined to package tour groups, in the future many Japanese will probably
travel to Korea on their own. The high visibility of Korea as a tourist
destination in available tour programs combined with an active advertising
program carried on by the airlines and tour agencies will encourage Japanese
to go to Korea on their own. This is particularly true of Japanese who have
a1'ready been there as part of a group.
{b) North American and European Vacation Visitor Traffic
15.       Tne Far East has been visited by comparatively few foreigners in
the past; however, the next few years should see a very real growth in the
number of vacation visitors from North America and Europe. They will
naturally continue to visit already popular places in the Orient, e.g. Hong
Kong, Tapan, etc. Several factors, however, will broaden the scope of the
area visited:  (l)more tour operators are offering inclusive tours to Asia
including countries which have hitherto had few vacation visitors, e.g. Korea,
Philippines, Indonesia, etc.; (2) sometime in the future, it is expected that
China will normalize its relations with other countries and will open its
doors to the ordinary vacationing tourist; (3) the western tourist who travels
hias been to countries in Europe and the Americas; his next natural travel goal
is Asia. It has become a feasible goal because of the increase in real income,
and a -reduction in costs of such travel through package tours.  For these
reasons., the number of foreign visitors to Asia from the U.S. and the other
wester2 countries will continute to increase steadily.  As the Korean Govern-
ment an" tour operators increase publicity both about Korea and tours available
to zhe a-rea, more western tourists visiting Asia will consider Korea an inter-
esting place to visit.
iTTT   Present Foreiga Visitor Traffic to Kyongiu
16.                is ex-pected to become, after Seoul, the principal point of
visitor interest in Korea. The number of foreign tourists to Kyongju increased
by 68% from 44,650 in 1971 to 77,30C in 1972.  Of the latter, only 46,000 stayed
for one n-ight cr more , reflectir.g the severe lack of accommodation and
other facilities for tourists.  According to the local hotel managers, more
than 90% of those coming to Kyongju are Japanese tourists, particularly group
or package tours staying in the area one or two nights on the way to or from-
Busan and Seoul. A very small number of non-Japanese foreign tourists visit Kyongju.
Average length of stay is short, 1.8 days.
17,      ,Sasunality o-f foreign visitor traffic to Kyongiu, like that for Korea
generalily, is not nnar'red.   Tihne f-low of visitor traffic is fairly constant
throughout the year except for the three winter months (December--February).
The temper-Cure of Kyongju is reiatively mild during the period April-November.
18,       Until the Seoul-Busan Highway opened in 1970, the railway was the
major means of transportation for visitors to Kyongju.  In 1972, more than
50,000 passenger cars traveled to the area. Rail is still important, however,
particularly for those Koreans in the lower-income brackets. Express bus
lines connect Kyongju to three major areas: Seoul (10 times daily); Taegu (21
time's daily); Pusan (35 times daily). It is expected that bus service will
continue to serve as the major means of transportation because of its frequency



ANNEX II
Page 7
and speed. A survey made by the Kyongju Tourism Development Economic Study Team
in 1972 showed that the most popular eans of transportation for foreign visitors
to Kyongju was the sightseeing bus, followed by taxis and express buses. The
train was the least popular form of transportation for foreign visitors.
IV.   Future Foreign Visitor Traffic to Kyongju
19,        Along with its natural scenic beauty, Kyongjuls historical and
cultural assets make the area appeal to a large number of foreign visitors.
Further, because of Kyongjuts easy accessibility from the major tourist areas
served by the highway between Busan and Seoul, the area can expect to obtain
a major part of the tourist influx to Korea-, if the necessary accommodations
and amenities are provided. Of the Japanese visitors to Korea, who will con-
stitute the bulk of foreign visitors to the country in the next decade, it is
estimated that more than half will visit Kyongju. As to non-Japanese visitors,
most of these will visit Korea on long holiday trips to Asia promoted by tour
operators,  Thus, the purpose of their trips to Korea will be purely for sight-
seeing with a relatively li-mited length of stay. In this regard, Kyongju
offers the most attractive possibilities for these tourists. It is expected
that the proportion of foreign visitors to the Kyongju area-by country of
origin will be about 85% from Japan, 10% from the U.S. and 5% from other
countries,
VI   Projections
20.        The total nunber of foreign visitor arrivals in Korea has been pro-
jected by the mission to increase from the actual figure of 370,700 in 1972 to
820,000 in 1976 and to 2 million by 1982.  This implies an average growth rate
of 18% per year over the whole period, as compared with 33% per year in the
period 1966-1972. It is estimated that some 28% of total foreign visitor
traffic to Korea will visit KyongJu in 1976 and that this proportion will rise
to almost 60% by 1982,  On this basis the number of foreign visitors to ':,Yongju
is projected to increase to 233,000 in 1976 and 1.2 million in 1982.  Of trese,
assuming that the first stage of development plan for Bomun is completed in the
middle of 1976, it is projected that the number who will stay overnight in
Kyongju would be 116,500 in 1976, increasing to 805,500 in 1982; these figures
represent 50% of the expected total foreign visitors to Kyongju in 1976 and
68% in 1982,
21.        With regard to tourist expenditures, the Kyongju Tourism Development
Economic Study Team made a survey in 1972 indicating that average daily expendi-
tures by foreign tourists in Korea amounted to US$ 51 for overnight visitors
and US$ 17 for day visitors,  They also estimated average daily expenditures
per visitor to Kyongju at 'US$ 53 and US$ 20 respectively. These expenditure
levels seems relatively high for the existing tourist facilities in t'he area.
GTt is possible that the figures include a considerable amount or money spent
on entertainment at traditional Korean restaurants in the area by the overnight
visitors and, for the day visitors, expenditures for transportation between
Kyongju and the places they stay.) The mission has conservatively estimated
average daily expenditures by overnight visitors at US$ 43 (with an average
length of stay of 1.5 - 1,7 days) which represent an average expenditure of US$
50 for adult overnight visitors and US$ 20 for student groups. The average
daily expenditure for day visitors is estimated at US$ 15 for adults and US$

22.       Kyongju is still largely a center for domestic tourism.  In 1972,
1.3 million domestic tourists visited Kyongju, of which 1 million stayed in
the Kyongju (city) area for more than one night. The development of the
Bomun Lake area will serve to increase the number of domestic tourists
visiting Kyongju and a substantial number of these tourists will visit the
project area. There will naturally be an increase in revenues from this
source. However, it is very difficult to estimate such revenues in the
Bomun resort. The mission assumes that this amount will be offset by the
fact that foreign overnight visitors will spend some of their projected ex-
penditures outside of the Bomun resort. Therefore, the above projections
do not take into consideration the anticipated increase in spending by local
tourists. For this reason, and in view of the assumptions described earlier
regarding the growth of the market, length of stay and average daily expen-
diture, these projections are considered highly conservative.

KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE KIONGJU TOURISM PROJECT
ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIOA-/
PROJECT COSTS AND BENEFITS
1.        The gross benefits resulting from the tourism related components of the
project are taken to be only the expenditures made by visitors in the Kyongju-
Boaun Lake area. Although some portion of their expenditures on international
and domestic transportation are properly attributable to the project, they have
not been taken into account in the calculation of project rates of return since
it is not possible in practice to calculate the appropriate costs and benefits.
An important characteristic of the tourist expenditure in the Bomun resort area
is that over 95% of it will consistb of foreign exchange.
2.      The relevant costs are the capital and operating costs of the infrastructure
provided under the proposed project, plus the capital and operating costs of hotel
accommodation and related superstructure in the project area such as restaurants
and entertainment facilities. The revenue and cost assumptions are explained below.
REVENUE ASSUM-PTIONS
3.      As the project is part of a larger whole, including the hotels and other
superstructure facilities, its economic evaluation has been made in terms of this
larger whole. Some of the facilities to be provided would serve and be paid for
directly by the tourists, while others would be compensated for only indirectly.
Accordingly, the costs and benefits must be carefully analyzed so as to avoid
double counting.
4.      It is assumed that visitor expenditures in the Bomun Lake resort area
would not differ substantially from expenditures of air visitors to Korea generally.
On the basis of official records of foreign exchange receipts, the average daily
expenditure was estimated to be about US$40.00 in 1972.  Official exchange receipts,
however, tend to underestimate tourist expenditure to some degree. According to a
1/ This annex deals only with the tourism related components of the project, while
the justification of the agricultural component is dealt with in Annex IV and
the utilities in Annexes V and VI. The tourism related components, including
the cost of hotels and other superstructure, represent over 90% of the total
investment program.

Page 2-
survey conducted recently in the Kyongju city area, overnight guests were estimated
to spend about US$53.00 and day visitors about US$20.00 per day.  However, the
gross revenue projections for the Bomun Lake area are based on a more conservative
assumption by the mission of an average daily expenditure of US$43.00 for overnight
guests and US$10.00 per day for daily visitors.
5.      The combined average daily expenditure of hotel guests and daily visitors
in the :=Ject area would thus be about US$34.65, and would be distributed as
follows:  hotel ($17.35); shopping ($4.35); food and beverage outside the hotels
($3.45); recreation, including golf ($4.35); and other, including local transportation
($5.20).
6.      In projecting project revenues it was assumed that the average length of
stay of hotel guests would increase from 1.5 days in 1976 to 1.7 in 1981, and remain
constant thereafter. The projected increases in hotel accommodation would achieve
a leve7 of roorm occupancy of 75% in three years, with a first year occupancy of 55%.
Occupancy of 1.6 persons per room is assumed to remain the same throughout the
economic life of the project.
OOST ASSUMPTIONS
7.      1:onomic costs of operating the superstructure facilities are derived
from the projected financial accounts of hotels, restaurants, and other facilities,
which in vurn are based on actual experience of sbailar facilities elsewhere in
Korea. the projected operating and maintenance costs of the non revenue earning
infrastructure items (such as roads, street lighting and landscape maintenance)
have been included in the calcul.tion of operating and maintenance costs for the
project operating unit - KTA. Revenue earning infrastructure (such as electricity,
water and sewerage) has been excluded from the rate of return calculations for
zhe ,ourias  ralated components of the project.  The gross revenues of these
utilities have been projected on the basis of expected consumption by the hotels
and other superstructure facilities. The projection of utilities charges in
the aperating costs of the superstructure facilities has been carefully matched
with ithe projected gross revenues of the utilities. The gross operating profit
of the utilities has then been counted as a benefit in Justifying the related
investments (see Annexes V and VI).
8.      Hotel investment costs are assumed to average US$22,000 per room, ex-
cluding the cost of 'Lands  Iavestment costs, operating costs and gross revenues
are all calculated in 1973 prices. The capital costs and gross operating profits
of t'ce -Wourism project are summarized belows

10.     Individual sub-components of the project have varying economic lives, but
as a whole it is estimated that the project would have an economic life of about
25 years. For purposes of calculating the internal rate of return, the need to
make modest provision for some replacement expenditures during this period i9'
considered to be offset by the life of the main assets beyond 25 years.
1/  In this case, the *typical yearly for the complex as a whole begins in 1984,
since some hotels would not reach their normal projected occupancy levels until
then. Figures are in 1973 prices.

INTERNAL ECONIC MRATE OF REURN
11.       Based on the above assumptions, the internal economic rate qf
return on the tourism-related program of investments would be 18.5%.1
The acquisition costs of land have been reviewed and are considered to
ref:lect reasonably accurately the economic value of land in terms of its
alternative uses. On the basis of the relative availability of skilled
and unskilled workers in the area, their proportional employment in the
project, and the existing wage levels for each, Jt is expected that under-
pricing of skilled labor will roughly offset over-pricing of unskilled
lzbor. Hence, no adjustment for shadow-wages has been made in the esti-
mated payroll costs of the project. Furthermore, a shadow exchange rate
has not been used in estimating the true economic rate of return.
12. *      - is expected that foreign investors will be interested in
building hotels at Bomun. Assuming that one half the hotel rooms would
be financed from abroad, the rate of return on the purely domestically
financed investment (including the Bank loan, but excluding both the for-
eign private investment and the net repayments and other returns accruing
to foreigners) would be 20.7%.  This is because foreign hotel investors
would not participate in those benefits of the project arising from tourist
expenditures outside the hotels and would receive an after-tax return on
their investment somewhat lower than the project's overall rate of return -
thus raising the share and the rate of return accruing to domestic capital
(including the Bank-financed portion). If the expected foreign private
investment were available only for this tourism project, without any im-
pact whatsoever on the amount and terms of foreign capital available for
the rest of the economy, then the return on domestic investment (including
the Bank loan) would be the relevant one to consider. If, on the other
hand, the private foreign investment in tourism were part of a foreign
capital pool available to the whole Korean economy, fully determined in
respect to its size and terms, then clearly the relevant consideration
would be the return on the overall investment. The foreign share would
then be part of the overall resource pool under Korea's command, over
which it must maximize returns. Presumably, the true situation is inter-
mediate between these two extremes; some of the private foreign investment
1/ The two major roads (Namsan and Bobul) included in the tourism-related
program of0 investments were evaluated separately by the consultants,
in terms of road-user benefits. Their calculations yielded rates of
return in excess of 20% for each road.



ANI'i III

in tourism may not be available for other projects, but it does influence
the amount of other capital inflows, and its terms. However, as the
returns both on the overall project and on the Korean funds invested
in it (including IBRD funds) are quite satisfactory, the project is
acceptable under any reasonable assumption about its impact on capital
inflows to the Korean economy.
SENSITIVIT! ANAIYSIS
13.      *The rate of return would be sensitive to changes in investment
costs, the opening date and gross operating profit levels. With varying
assumptions for each of these factors, the internal economic return would
range from 15.9 to 19.9%. Results of this sensitivity testing are shown
in the following table:
Resulting Rate of Return (%)
(i) Investment costs +10%                           17.1

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND EMPLYMTET  FFECTS
14.       The proposed project is expected to increase gross foreign ex-
change earnings by about TJS$ 8.4 million in 1976 when the first hotels
open and by US$ 71.0 million per year from 1984 when all of the hotels
will have achieved their projected "typical year" occupancy levels. This
compares with US$ 74.7 million earned by tourism in Korea in 1972. Because
of the high proportion of foreign tourists expected to visit the area,
and the low import content of operating costs (about 10% in existing hotels
in Korea), the estimated net foreign exchange earnings of the project are
relatively high. In order to account for the possible transfers of invest-
ment income abroad by foreign hotel investors and operators, we have assumed
that roughly one-half of the hotel rooms may involve foreign ownership and,
hence, that as much as one-half of the annual net profits of the hotels
1/ The Gross Operating Profit of hotels and other superstructure.



ANNBE III

might be repatriated. Projecting a net profit on sales of about 5% in
1976 (when the first hotels come on stream) and 10% by 1984 (when the
hotels reach their full projected occupancy levels), the repatriation
of profits could amount to as much as US$ 0.21 million in 1976, and
US$ 3.55 million by 1984. On this basis, the net foreign exchange earnings,
after accounting for the foreign exchange component of operating and
capital costs, and the repatriation of profits by foreign hotel operators,
would amount to US$ 7.9 million in 1976 and US$ 62.8 million in 1984,
which compares with the estimated foreign exchange component of the pro-
posed project of US$ 18.8 million including price contingencies and the
foreign exchange component of superstructure of about US$ 25.0 million.
15.       When fully operational, the project is expected to provide
direct employment for about 5,400 workers in the hotels and 1,500 in
other facilities of the resort. Indirect employment generated in
agriculture, handicrafts, transportation ana other service sectors is
difficult to estimate but may amount to 10,000 to 15,000 new jobs.

KOREA: APPRAISAL OF THE KYONGJU TOURISM PROJECT
DUCK-DONG DAM AND IRRIGATION COMPONENT
A. Scope of the Project
1.        Development of the Kyongju tourist resort at Bomun Lake requires
construction of a multi-purpose dam at Duck-Dong, upstream from the present
Bomun reservoir, to create a new reservoir which would enable stabilization
of the lake level at Bomun, a feature desirable for recreational and envi-
ronmental purposes in connection with the tourist resort itself. In
addition, the new reservoir would provide sufficient water supply, not
otherwise available, for the tourist resort and for the increasing needs of
the City of Kyongju (see Annex V). Inasmuch as about 1,227 ha of land are
presently being irrigated from the existing Bomun reservoir, the new up-
stream reservoir would continue to provide water for this purpose. It would
also enable irrigation of an additional area of 1,100 ha for which an irri-
gation system would be constructed as part of the Project.
2.        Construction of Duck-Dong dam and the new irrigation system would
be carried out by the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC), a semi-
autonomous public entity within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
ADC has broad responsibilities for the development of land and water re-
sources in rural areas throughout Korea, and is already a beneficiary of
two Bank loans for irrigation projects (600-KO and 795-743-KO). Upon comple-
tion, ADC would transfer the Duck-dong dam to the Kyongju City Government
(KCG) since its main purpose would be for municipal water supply, including
supply of the tourist resort at Bomun. The irrigation system would be operated
and maintained by ADC, while the Farmland Improvement Association (FLIA)  or
other suitable organization, would assume responsibility for maintaining thne
system at the farm level.  This arrangement would be similar to those made for
other irrigation projects in Korea.
B. The Project Area
Climate
3.        The project area is roughly rectangular, with a mean width oL 1.2 km,
a length of 12 km and the long axis running north to south. The eastern side
is bordered by a ranage of mountains rising to 600 m. This feature has an
important influence on the local climate. It provides a substantial degree
of protection fro, typhoons and consequent floods which are common on Korea's
east coast. In addition, the mountains cause some light precipitation in the
area in the dry years which are frequent in the region.



An1m  IV
Page 2
4.        Decaier, January and February are the coolest months, with average
temperatures of 0.40 to -3.5° C. July and August are the hottest months, with
a maximum temperazure of 310 C.  The cropping season is between March and
November. The mean annual rainfall is 1,350 mm. In dry years, which occur
in one out of four years on the average, the mean annual precipitation is
750 mu. Fifty percent of yearly rainfall is recorded between June and Septem-
oer. Relative humidity is lowest from December through June and highest in
July througn September. The mean annual evaporation is approximately 2,000 mm,
of which between 1,000 mm and 1,700 mm occur during the irrigation season.
Soils, Topography and Drainage
The project covers an area of about 1,500 ha of which, 1,140 ha
are irrigable.  It is bisected along its long side by a major highway.
Approximately 60% of the project area lies between the highway and the Eastern
foothills. The land is undulating with slopes varying from 2 to 15%. Two
thirds of the area is used mainly for rice production, the steeper land being
under upland crops. The existing paddy fields are small and subdivided, but
the steep slopes preclude rearrangement and land consolidation because of the
high costs. There is a number of very small reservoirs which command only
immediately adjacent areas. In the areas West of the main highway the lands
are flat and used principally for rice production. Land consolidation is
proposed in this section.
6.        Soils in the steeper Eastern section of the project area are sandy
loams of low to moderate fertility with good natural drainage. In the Western
section the soils are coarser, with higher sand and gravel contents. The
coarse textured soils of the sandy alluvial deposits on the Western edge of
the prqject area, near the river, are poorly drained because of a high water
table and seasonal floods, despite their inherently low water holding capacity
and high permeability. Natural drainage is inadequate in the Western Section.
Land Holdings
7.        Approximately 1,300 farm families, averaging six members per family,
for a total of 7,800 people would be involved in the project area. The mean
size of holding is 0.88 ha, which is slightly less than the national average
of 0.92 ha.
Agricultural Production
8.        Rice and barley account for 80% of the area presently under cultiva-
tion, with rice giving 90% of the total value of production. Only 20% of the
rice area is irrigated from small tanks, the balance being rainfed. The
average yield of polished rice amounts to 2.5 ton/ha. Barley is grown as a
second crop on the higher, better drained land, giving a mean yield of 1.9
ton/ha. Small areas of soy bean and various vegetables are also grown.
Present cropping intensity in the pro,ect area is estimated at 138%.



ANNEX IV
Page 3
9.        Farm operations are still nearly entirely carried out by hand or
by buffalo, despite the shortage of farm labor and the increase in farm
wages in recent years. A campaign to promote mechanization through the use
of power tillers does not appear to have had much impact, as the rate of
tillers to farm families is reported as 1:900.
C. Project Description
10.       The project would consist of the following major works:
(a) Duck-Dong dam and reservoir, spillway and Bomun
outlet works;
(b) reservoir outlet works for the Bulguk Temple area
irrigation system;
(c) Bulguk Temple area irrigation system consisting of
canals, flumes, conduits, tunnels and a pumping
station;
(d) land consolidation for 1,000 ha; and
(e) road relocation.
11.       The Duck-Dong damr is to be a zoned earthfill type (see data in Table 5).
The proposed zoning and slopes for the upstream and downstream are adequate.
Bedrock is a hard metamorphosed shale which is suitable for the foundation of the
dam. A grout curtain is included in the cost estimate The new Duck-Dong reservoir,
in addition to providing water to 1227 ha of land presently irrigated from the
Bomun reservoir, would also supply 30,000 tons of water per day for municipal use
and provide water for the irrigation of a newly developed area of 1,140 ha in
the vicinity of Bulguk Temple.
12.       Bulguk Intake and Conduit.  A multigated intake tunnel would provide
for reservoir withdrawals at four levels. The tunnel would have a diameter of
2.5 m and a length of 470 m and would lead into a concrete conduit 1,700 m long.
13.       Irrigation Canal.  The total length of the main canal would be 17,000
m, consisting of 5,000 m of concrete flume and 12,000 m of earth canal. The
canals would be unlined and flumes and drop structures would be concrete.
14.       Land Consolidation and on-farm Development.  The 695 ha of land in
the Eastern section of the project would only be provided with irrigation.
Approximately 200 ha of the steeper land, with slopes of more than 10%, would
be irrigated directly from turnouts from the main canal. The remaining 485 ha
of lands, with slopes between 2 and 10%, would be irrigated through secondary
laterals. Roads would be built along the laterals. In the lower lying,
flatter Western section of the project area 445 ha area would be subject to
rearrangement, consolidation, land levelling and the provision of farm roads.
Shallow drains would be provided on 370 ha and deep rains would be dug on 75 ha
of poorly drained land lying on the western edge of the project area. Included
in the on-farm development would be the reclamation of 10 ha of forest land,
most of which is sited on the steeper eastern side of the project area.



ANNEX IV
Page 4
15.       Road Relocation.  The present road through the proposed reservoir
would be relocated above the high water level and would extend to a point
above the Hwang Yong Valley branch of the reservoir, a length of about 4.1
km. This road would serve as access to the Bulguk intake tower. In addition,
two roads, Duck-Dong north and part of Boduck road, would be constructed in
order to support development of the adjoining area and to maintain communi-
cation with the area north of the Duck-Dong reservoir. Details are described
in Annex VII.
D. Water Supply, Demand and Quality
16.       Rainfall in the project area is erratic and ill-timed to support
maxim=u farm production. The run-off from the catchment area has been
estimated on the basis of 20 years (1952-71) of rainfall data, from Po Hang
Meteorological Station and 2 (1963-65) years of stream flows from gaging
stations downstream of the Duck-Dorgdam site. The average annual run-off for
the Duck-Dong catchment is estimated at 31.5mim3. Crop water requirements for
the 1,200 ha of project lands were estimated on the basis of double cropping.
T'he reservoir operations study indicates that project requirements would be
met in 17 years out of 20. From experience on lands irrigated from the Bomun
reservoir, no problems of water quality are anticipated.
E. Cost Estimates
17.       Total costs of the Duck-Dorng dam and Irrigation system are estimated
at wor. 3,315 million (US$ 8.3 million). Of this total Won 1,693 million
(US$ 4.2 million) has been charged to agricultural development.  This sum
represenits 17% of the cost of the dam, based on the share of the water which
will be used for irrigation, 100% of the cost of the irrigation system and
land consolidation and on-farm development and that portion of total engineer-
ing, administration, consulting and land acquisition costs incurred for
agricultural development. Technical contingencies included in the agricultural
development cost estimates consist of 15% on the dam, 5% on the main canal and
10% on on-farm development (land consolidation). A price contingency based
on a cumulative 7% per year is also included in the cost estimates.
F.  Procurement and Project Execution
18.       All aivil works under the project would be executed by contractors
selected or. .he basis of international competitive bidding.  ADC, with the
assistance of consultants, would be responsible for supervision of construc-
tion. The domestic civil engineering industry has grown rapidly in recent
years and .has proved capable of handling major public works. Local contrac-
tors are expected to be the successful bidders on all contracts under the project.
19.       All contracts for equipment and supplies would be subject to interna-
tional bidding, ADC, with the assistance of the consultants, would have
responsibility for the preparation of specifications and evaluation of the
technical aspects of bids received, while the Office of Supply of the Republic
of Korea (OSROK) would handle procurement procedures.



ANNEX IV
20.       ADCOs staff would be assisted by consultants in the preparation
of final designs and tender documents, the evaluation of bids, supervision
of construction and preparation of payments to contractors.
G. Project Operation and Maintenance
21.       On existing irrigation projects the Farmers Land Improvement
Associations (FLIA) are responsible for operation, maintenance and recovery
of investment. The associations function as independent entities, but their
annual operating budgets are subject to approval either by the Provincial
Government or by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery (MAF), depending on
the size of the project involved.
22.       ADC would be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
reservoirs. The FLIA, or other suitable organization, would be responsible
for operation and maintenance of on-farm systems, the scheduling ov water
deliveries, the allocation and collection of project charges, and would also
be expected to provide extension services and to enter into agreements with
agencies such as the Office of Rural Development (ORD) and the National
Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF) for assistance to the project
farmers.
H. Supporting Agricultural Services
23.       The Office of Rural Development (ORD) is the Government agency
responsible for agricultural extension, research and demonstration.  ORD
would provide the project farmers with advice on irrigation and drainage
practices, the use of farm machinery, the cultivation of fruit and vegetables
and the proper application of lime and agro-chemicals.
24.       Farmers obtain fertilizers and agro-chemicals through the cooperatives
of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF). NACF also provides
the short-term credit to finance. farm operations. The availability of credit
in adequate amounts and at the right time will be essential to the success
of the project.
I. Project Charges
25.       It is Government policy that farmers belonging to FLIA's, the irri-
gation users' associations, who benefit from irrigation development are required
to pay the operation and maintenance costs of the proJect and 40% of the capital
costs, with interest at 3.5%, normally within a period of 30 to 40 years. It
is estimated that the annual charge to farmers would total US$ 86/ha, of which
US$ 36/ha would be for operation and maintenance and the balance of us$ 50/ha
would be the farmers' contribution to the project's capital cost. Total
project charges, including operation and maintenance, would only account for
12% of the net incremental farm income.



ANNEX IV

J.  Production
26.       The introduction of irrigation, together with land consolidation
and on-farm development, better accessibility, drainage, and increased use
of farm machinery, would permit a greater cropping intensity, better yields
and a greater diversity of cropping.  Expected yeild levels Jn ton/ha for
the main irrigation crops under the project are as follows:- rice, 3.8
(2.5); barley, 2.6 (1.9); Chinese cabbage, 28.0 (12.0); white potato, 16.0
(6.5); sweet potato, 23.0 (7.9). The projected yield for rice is based on
a yield of 4.1 ton/ha on the area that would be subject to full on-farm
development and a yield of 3.5 ton/ha on the area where only irrigation would
be supplied. Expected yield levels would be attained gradually over a five-
year period following the inception of irrigation.
27.       At full development the relative incidence of rice and barley in
the cropping pattern is expected to decline slightly from the present level
of 80% to 73%, but the contribution of the two crops to the net income is
expected to fall sharply from the existing level of 96% to 65%. This would
come about through an increase in cropping intensity from the present 139%
to 189%.

Total     1,570      2,160
K. Market Prospects
28.       The increased production from the project area is not expected to
give any marketing problems. The additional quantities of food grains are
very modest. The various vegetable crops produced would be readily disposed
of in the major urban areas, which are not distant from the project and are
easily accessible. The range of vegetables grown is sufficiently wide to
permit rapid shifts from one crop to another in response to market conditions.
The proposed cropping pattern provides for 50 ha of orchard crops. The project
is located in the main apple-producing area of Korea. The local demand for
fruit and vegetables would increase with implementation of the tourism project.
L. Economic Analysis
29.       Irrigation coupled with land consolidation and on-farm development
would bring about a substantial increase in agricultural production, almost
entirely through higher productivity; a diversification of farm activities
1/ Figures in parentheses represent current yields.

from the rice-barley sequence into higher value crops; an increase in farm
income; and through the increased production of rice and cereals, a reduc-
tion in Korea's foodgrain deficit. It would also contribute toward realizing
Government's goal of bringing about a more equitable income distribution
between the urban and rural areas and becoming self sufficient in rice pro-
duction.
30.       In evaluating the benefits from agricultural development a price
of US$ 220 per M ton for rice and US$ 88 per M ton of barley were used.
This increase in the value of rice and barley from the projected IBRD 1980
prices is in line with recent recommendations made in the Agricultural
Sector report. Prices for all other crops were based on present average
farm gate prices. All hired labor requirements have been costed at the
going market rate. Irrigation was assumed to be introduced at the end of
the construction period in the second half of 1976. Commencing in 1977
incremental benefits would accrue gradually over a five-year period.
31.       At full agricultural development in 1981, the net value of agri-
cultural production would be US$ 0.84 million, with most of the increase
being accounted for by rice, garlic, potatoes, vegetables and orchards.
The corresponding value without the project assuming a 10% p.a. yield
increase through 1980, would have been about US$ 0.26 million. When dis-
counting the incremental benefits and relevant costs over a 50-year agri-
cultural development period, the economic rate of return would be about 13.7%.

AMNEX V
KOREA: APPRAISAL OF THE KYONGJU TOURISM PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY, SEWERAGE AND SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL COMPONENTS
A. Scope of the Project
1.         The development of the Bomun Lake resort for the construction of
initially 3,000 hotel rooms will cause a rapid development of the nearby city
of Kyongju. The population of Kyongju Administrative area is expected to
increase from 118,000 to about 168,000 over the next ten years.
2.         The project would provide facilities designed to increase the
percentage of the population served by pipe-borne water supply from about 38%
to 50% in the Kyongju area and provide adequate water supply for th.e tourist
zone. Water-borne sewerage would be provided for downtown Kyongju City and
for the tourism zone.  Equipment for the collection and disposal in landfill
of solid wastes is also provided in the project.
3.         Kyongju City Government (KCG) assisted by KDO and consultants would
be responsible for the construction of the water supply, sewerage and waste
disposal components. KCG intends to establish a separate water and sewerage
division which would be responsible for the operation of the scheme including
Duck-Dong Reservoir, the water supply source for Bomun. The Duck-Dong Dam
would be constructed by the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) along
with an irrigation scheme which would form another part of the overall project
to be financed by the Bank (see Annex IV). ADC would transfer the dam after
completion to KCG for operations as part of the water supply scheme for the
Bomun area. KCG would administer jointly with the Government agency responsible
for form level management the release of water from Duck-Dong Reservoir for
the various uses.
4.         In preparing the Duck-Dong water supply scheme, insufficient
consideration had been given to the exploration of groundwater as an alternative
or supplemental source of water supply.  A preliminary review of available data
suggested, however, that groundwater resources should not be neglected as a
potential source of water supply. The Government, therefore, undertook a
detailed investigation of the geological conditions prevailing in the Kyongju
area and has followed this up by a test drilling program. Preliminary results
of the test drilling are encouraging.
5.         In the early years of the project, therefore, particularly during the
period when the dam is being constructed and the reservoir is filling up, it may
be possible to rely on groundwater to supply the Bomun Lake resort area. In the
longer term, demands for water at Bomun and in Kyongju would require that the
two systems eventually be linked. Should groundwater not be available in
sufficient quantity and quality to meet even short term demands at Bomun, then
the two systems would need to be linked in time for the first hotels at Bomun
to be served by water pumped from the new treatment plant at Kyongju.



ANNI EX  V
Given the rather limited availability of water from the existing Kyongju City
water supply system5, owever, it would also be necessary to construct a
separate water treatment plant at the Duck-Dong Reservoir in order to meet the
full development needs of the Bomun Lake resort area. Provision for this
treatment plant has been included in the project; should sufficient quantities
of groundwater be available, of course, the treatment plant at Duck-Dong,
and possibly the link with the Kyongju system, could be postponed, with the
resultant savings utilized to extend the distribution network in the project
area.
B. Eescription of the Project
Water Supply - KyongJu City
5.        Kyongju City presently has a water supply of about 70 1/sec.
Work on a new treatment plant to increase this supply to about 230 1/sec
has commenced, and infiltration galleries with intake well at Tabdong in
the Hyung San river have been completed. The project will include the
completion of this scheme and will include:
(i)  imported equipment for the Tabdong treatment plant;
(ii) raw water low lift pump station with maximum capacity
of 230 1/sec equipped with 3 vertical spindle pumps
each capable of 115 1/sec;
(iii)  high lift, filtered water pump station with maximum
pumping capacity of 230 1/sec equipped with 4 electrically-
driven centrifugal pumps;
(iv)  5.6 Ian of 600 mm and 400 mm prestressed concrete and
steel  transmission pipeline;
(v)  5000 m3 distribution storage reinforced concrete reservoir
in Kyongju City; and
(vi)  2.7 km of 400 mm and 300 mm secondary water distribution
pipeline.
6.        The existing Kyongju City waterworks has slow sand filters,
and was built in 1933 at Chung Hyodong with a capacity of 35 1/sec.
This was doubled in 1967. It has two major operational problems; firstly,
a long suction pipeline leading to the intake well fed by infiltration
galleries in the Hmung San river which sometimes go dry in the summer;
and secondly, the water distribution main pipeline in the river bed is
poorly constructed and suffers frequent breaks. A recent health hazard
has been the discovery in the raw water of colilorm bacteria from sewage
discharged into the river by storm drains near the infiltration galleries.
If these problems worsen inr the future and the plant becomes uneconomical
to operate, the consultants recommend closing it as there is insufficient
land to rehabilitate or expand the planu in its present location.
7.        The new treatment plant under construction at Tabdong is loca-
ted upstream and away from the pollution hazard. Because there are no
records of flow in the Hyung San river the consultants based the capa-
city of the treatment plant on the lowest recorded drought discharge
of 210 1/sec at a recently established gauging station downstream from



ANNEX V
Page 3
the site. The plant is designed for an average output of 230 1/sec but
may be expected to operate at 170 I/sec for a few days in the dry season.
9.        The raw water from the infiltration galleries is expected to have
high turbidity in some seasons of the year, requiring treatment. The three
vertical spindle pumps in the collecting well, each of 115 1/sec capacity
will lift the raw water to a conservatively-designed, conventional treat-
ment plant with alum dosing, rapid mix, flocculation, horizontal flow sedi-
mentation, rapid sand filtration, chlorination and lime treatment. The
high lift pump station will lift water to a 5000 m3 service reservoir pri-
marily serving Kyongju City. In the early years water will be pumped from
Kyongju to Bomun, unless groundwater is found, to provide water supply for
the tourist resort until the water supply from the new Duck-Dong Reservoir
fills over two seasons, and initial taste, color and odor problems of
organic origin are overcome.
Water Supply - Bomun Resort
10.       A multipurpose dam would be built above Bomun Lake at Duck-Dbng
(Annex IV). The impounded water would be used for irrigation, municipal water
supply and tourism. If the groundwater exploration is successful it may be
economical to use Duck-Dong lake water in the dry months, when it should
require only chlorination before distribution. In the wet months, when
demand is low and lake water is turbid, groundwater could be used. The
115 1/sec Bomun treatment plant presently proposed in the project could then
be substituted for by a less expensive groundwater pumping scheme.
11.       The facilities provided for the Bomun tourist zone are designed
to supply an average demand of 23 1/sec in 1976 increasing to about 115 1/sec
in 1982 and based upon a study of consumption of some of the leading hotels
in the country with allowances for daytime visitors and recreational
facilities. The facilities include:
(i)  a booster pumping station at Kyongju service reservoir
to deliver 70 1/sec to the Bomun tourist resort area;
(ii)  a 5000 m3 reinforced concrete service reservoir at Bomun;
(iii) 8.6 km, 700 mm reducing to 300 mm transmission pipeline
from Bomun service reservoir to the Kyongju service reservoir
booster pumping station;
(iv)  8.4 kcm, 300 mm reducing to 100 mm distribution network
for the Bomun tourist resort area including a small
booster pump for the golf course;
(v)  a 115 1/sec water treatment plant and intake pipeline
to the Duck-Dong Lake intake tower. The treatment plant
design would be similar to the Kyongju plant.
12.       The transmission pipeline capacity is designed for conveying
170 1/sec from Bomun to Kyongju in the next stage. Because of difficult
rocky terrain and so as not to disturb historical monuments, a single
pipeline is provided.

Sewerge - Bomun Resort
13.       Sewage collected from the Bomun resort complex of hotels,
commercial and recreational areas and residences will flow to a sewage
pumping station to be lifted into an outfall sewer and treatment plant
at Hwang Seong northeast of Kyongju City.  The facilities include:
(i)  a sewage collection network of about 4 km including
manholes;
(ii)  three small lift stations for the commercial, entertain-
ment and transportation areas;
(iii)  a main sewage lift station;
(iv) 9.6 km gravity outfall sewer, 600 mm dia.; and
(v)  treatment by aerated lagoons at Hwang Soong.
14.       During detailed review when preparing the final design, more
economical sizes would be chosen for some of these components. Concrete
pipe is proposed for the sewers of diameters 300 mm and upwards. The
effluent would be piped into the Hyung San River.
Sewerage - Kyongiu City
15.       An interceptor sewer laid on the east bank of the Hyung San river
would collect sewage from downtown Kyongju City. A sewage pumping station
would lif& sewage from the interceptor into an outfall sewer leading to the
treatment works at Hwang Seong.
16.       The facilities included in the project for Kyongju are:
(i)  a sewage collection network of about 15 km for downtown
Ayongju City;
(ii) 2.8 km interceptor sewer of diameter varying from 700 me
to 1000 mm;
(iii)  a sewage pumping station;
(iv) 1.3 km outfall sewer diameter 1100 mm; and
(v)  treatment by aerated lagoons at Hwang Seoug.
17.       During detailed review when: preparing the final designs economical
sizes would be chosen for most of these components. House connections and
the laying of sewers in lanes would be paid for by property owners and con-
structedby Kyongju Municipality.
Solid Waste - Bomun and &yongju
18.       KCG would collect, segregate and dispose solid wastes in sanitary
.ill at selected areas of Yrongju.  The equipment presently used by the
refuse disposal bureau of the Municipality would be strengthened by 8 new
trucks procured under the project. The segregation of garbage and waste
would be accomplished manually by small time traders and farmers who would
salvage all usefUl items. The hotels are expected to incinerate some of
the refuse such aE waste paper.



ANNEX V
Page 
C. Cost Estimates
19.       The estimated cost of water supply, sewerage, solid waste dis-
posal are summarized in Annex I, Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.  The estimates are
based on designs prepared by Korean Engineering Consultants Corporation
(KECC). Following a review of the designs by outside consultants there
may be cost savings during detailed design. There may be other cost
savings if groundwater proves to be a possible supplementary source of
water.  The cost estimates are based on Korean cost of goods and civil
works on recent tendered prices by contractors. A price contingency
allowance of 7% per year and physical contingency of 15% for water sup-
ply and 20% for sewerage have been assumed; these provisions should be
adequate. Design costs are estimated at 3% of construction costs, and
the cost of construction supervision is estimated at 6%.
D. Procurement and Project Execution
20.      All contracts for the supply of equipment would be subject to
internationaL competitive bidding. In view of the fact that only local
contractors are likely to submit bids for civil work, only national
competitive bidding would be required.
21.       KCG would employ KECC to design the project.  KEOC would em-
ploy outside consultants to review the preliminary engineering studies
and assist with the design.
E. Institutional Aspects
22.       KCG presently operates the existing water supply for Kyongju
City as part of its municipal functions and keeps records for financial
transactions in accordance with the prescribed Government accounting sys-
tem. The revenues and expenditures for water supply are recorded sep-
arately as "special fund" transactions, the same as revenues and expen-
ditures for housing development and the farmers' lending program.
23.       Organizationally water supply operations are integrated into
the other functions of KCG; the small water supply operating staff of
about 13 is a section of the City Planning Department. The accounts
are kept by the Budget and Planning Dept., while construction work is
the responsibility of the Construction Department. Collection of bills
for water supply is the responsibility of the 40 "village" administra-
tions, which are subsections of XCG; this system appears to have worked
quite satisfactorily since there are practically no uncollected water
bills.
24.       The Mayor is a well-experienced administrator, and the staff of
KCG is capable and efficient. The water losses which are estimated at
42% are mainly due to leaking water mains damaged by heavy military traf-
fic. A well planned program of leak detection and relaying of water
mains has already been started by KCG and is expected to reduce water
losses to about 30% within the next few years.

Page 6
25.       While the present organization of water supply operations was
adequate to handle a system serving between 2,500 and 4.,000 connections,
the increasing responsibility to expand the water supply system both for
the city and for the Bomun lake area, and the addition of sewerage services
for both areas would require a larger nmber of staff with appropriate
qualifications. KCG therefore has established a separate Water and
Sewerage Division   within the City Government.  (A list of the proposed
staff positions is attached, Table 1).
F. Financial Aspects
Present Financial Position
26.       KCG does not maintain accounting records for the water supply
operations which readily provide informatiox, about the past financial results
of these operations. Proforma financial statements have therefore been
constructed from the available information about the "special fund"  trans-
actions for the past three years. These statements (see Tables 2, 3 and 4)
indicate that KCG's water operations have had quite satisfactory financial
results with rates of return ranging from about 12% - 19%. This is mostly
due to the fact that the existing assets have already been written off,
since they were built about 40 years ago. Most noticeable, however,is the
fact that water bills are collected currently and operating costs are well
covered, leaving an adequate operating profit to cover interest and debt
service payments on the small amount of long-term loans. It is further
noteworthy that records are meticulously kept and a businesslike procedure
is adhered to in dealing with revenue producing activities of the municipality.
27.       The major deficiency in the present financial control of the
water supply operations is the absence of audit arrangements. With the
establishment of a separate Water and Sewerage Division   within KCG, the
regular preparation and audit of finAncial statemants in accordance with
sound public utility principles needs to be instituted. KCG should there-
fore be required to engage management consultants to establish an accounting
system for the new department and to make proposals for appropriate staffing
of the accounting and finance section. Because of the relatively small
scale of presem- opezrations the first set of financial statements along
comzmercial lines could be prepared for the fiscal year ending December 31,
19747 with comparative statements for 1973.  From January 1, 1975 onwards
annual audits of KC'Gts Water and Sewerage Div.  by independent commercial
auditors shoaud be requLaed.  In addition, appropriate Government audit
arrangements should be made for ECG's other municipal activities.

29.       The Government contribution would be made available through bud-
get allocations to ECG and ADC. Upon completion of construction ADC would
transfer the Duck Dong Dam assets to KCG along with the liability for the
proceeds from the Bank loan and the accrued Government contribution.
Appropriate arrangements between ADC and KCG would be required in the
subsidiary loan agreements between the Government, and KCG and ADO. It
has been assumed that all Government contributions would be made without
repayment conditions or interest charges.



A i E X V
Future Financial Results
30.       A projection of the financial results of KCG's water supply,
sewerage and waste disposal operations (see tables 2, 3 and 4) indicates
that services could be provided to both Kyongju city and the Bomun lake
area at acceptable utility rates which would produce satisfactory debt
service ratios and rates of return. The financial projections are based
on a number of assumptions which are listed in the Notes to Tables 2 - .
31.       One of the main assumptions is the rate structure for water and
sewerage services in the city and in the hotel area. The financial results
sh.nown ir, the attached tables are based on a suggested rate of Won 100 per
m3 of water for hotel wateraipply and a surcharge of Won 50 per m3 for
hotel sewerage services. The rates for water supply n the city of Kyongju
would remain at their present level of Won 20.0 per mi (ranging from Won
16 to Won 40 for various classes of users). The sewerage charges for the
City are proposed to be Won 20 per m3 for all water consum rs connected
to the new sewerage system and a surcharge of Won 10 per m for all water
consumers not connected.
32.       The development contribution included in KCG's financ'al forecast
represents payments in lieu of water and sewerage charges to be made by
KTA during the development period 1976-1981. These payments are required
to provide KCG with adequate earnings during the period when provision of
water and sewerage services for the Bomun resort area would not yield
sufficient revenue without excessively high water and sewerage charges to
the hotels during the initial period. The direct user charges for these
services have therefore been designed in accordance with the demand expected
at full development of the resort area in 1982;  these charges would then
provide satisfactory rates of return to KCG (see para 32). In the interim
period KTA would pay a total estimated amount of Won 512.0 million in
gradually decreasing annual installments. The amount of prepayments to
KCG would later be recovered as part of the charges by KTA to the hotels
(Annex VIII). This arrangement would avoid any Government subsidies
for turism infrastructure facilities during the development period.
33.       These assumed future utility charges would produce overall rates
of return on net fixed assets in operation between 7% in 1976 and about
11% in 1982. Water supply and sewerage operations would equally contribute
to this satisfactory financial performance. The debt ratio of KCGts Water
and Sewerage Division would range between 43% of total capitalization to
29% at the end of the forecast period.  The debt service coverage would be
equally satisfactory, except for an exceptional year, when it would drop to
1.1 as a result of interest paymen's on the Bank loan during the construc-
tion period;  all other years show debt service coverages of 1.7 or better.



ANEX V
Page 9
34.       A peculiar feature of the financial forecast of the KCG Water
and Sewerage Division operations is the fact that no expansion program
of facilities other than those included in the Bank Project can be taken
into account. From 1976 onwards an investment fund therefore will absorb
gradually increasing amounts of cash generated from operations. The total
amount available for future projects during the period 1976-82 would be
about Won 1.2 billion. This is an amount roughly equal to 50% of the
combined Water Supply and Sewerage System expenditures (excluding the Duck-
Dong Dam) during the period 1974-78. This amount would be available for
possible extension of Water Supply and Sewerage Services in Kyongju Cityj
development of additional tourism infrastructure or repayment of capital
to the Government, if no immediate use of the funds can be made.
Financial Covenants
35.       The financial performance of the KCG Water Supply and Sewerage
Division would be controlled by the following financial covenants to ensure
that utility charges would cover operating expenses (including adequate
depreciation) and produce a reasonable rate of return on net fixed assets
in operation:
(i) during the construction period water rates for the
City of Kyongju would remain at least at the present
level, if necessary adjusted for inflation;
(ii) after completion of this project component water and
sewerage rates for the hotel area and the city would
be determined in consultation with KTA to allow
KCG to earn an overall rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation, suitably adjusted for changes in
price levels, of 7% for the first four years and 8%
thereafter (the rates assumed in the financial fore-
cast would meet these requirements);
(iii) KTA would make an adequate development contri-
bution to KCG in addition to direct user charges during
the gradual development of the hotel complex (see
para. 28).
36.       In order to ensure the continuing financial viability of the Water
and Sewerage Division, this division would undertake no other projects during
the construction period of the Bank project without the Bank's approval. After
completion of the Project, KCG would not incur any long-term debt for the
Water and Sewerage Division without the Bank's approval if its net operating
revenues should be less than 1.5 times the maximum future debt service require-
ments on all of the Water and Sewerage Division's long-term debt.

ANNEX V
Notes to Tables 1-3
KOREA
KCG Water and Sewerage Division
Assumptions for Financial ProJections
Cash Flow
1.          It has been assumed that KCG would be directly responsible
for construction of the water supply, sewerage and waste disposal pro-
ject and that all capital expenditures would be made directly by KCG.
It has further been assumed that ADC would construct the Duck Dong dam
and transefer all capital expenditures allocated to water supply
to KCG upon completion, now expected early in 1977.
2.          Working capital requirements have been calculated as roughly
one-fourth of annual billing.
3.          It has been assumed that the proceeds of the Bank loan would
be relent to KCG at 7.25% 20 years repayment including 5 years' grace.
4.          Land acquisition cost in the amount of Won 141 million have
been assumed to be included in KCG's 1973 accounts.
,.          No repayment of or interest on Government contributions has
been assumed.
Income Statements
6.          The projection of water sales in Kyongju City is based on
population forecasts assuming a natural growth rate of 2.5%, similar to
the national growth rate, and immigration of up to 80% of the estimated
additional employment generated by the Bomun tourist resort. The per-
centage of population served has been'assumed to increase from presently
38% to 42% following completion of the Tabdong treatment plant in 1975.
After that annual increases of 2% have been assumed.
7.          Per capita water consumption in Kyongju has been estimated
at 74 lpca presently with an increase of 2 lped for each year. As a
result of the leak detecting program already started by KCG the percen-
tage of unaccounted for water has been assumed to decrease from present-
ly 42% to 30% by 1980. The total number of water connections in Kyongju
has been assumed to double within the next six years.
8.          Of some 9,000 houses in Kyongju City half have water connec-
tions at present. When the sewerage scheme is commissioned about 2,000
houses and shops in downtown Kyongju would be connected in the first
two years, after which the number of new connections has been assumed
to decrease to 750 for two years and 500 per year thereafter.
9.          The consumption of water in the Bomun hotel area has been
conservatively estimated at 1,000 m3 per hotel room per annum. This
is roughly equivalent to 2,800 lpd per hotel room, a consumption level
which now prevails at leading hotels in Seoul. This estimate takes



ANNEX V
Notes to Tables 1-3
-2_
into &ccount water consumpticn for employees and daytime visitors, and
at recreational facilities.
10.         The ziumber of sever connections in Bomun has been assumed
to increase gradually from imitially 10 in 1977 to 60 in 1982.
11.         The everage water rate per m3 applying to consumption in
Kyongju has been assumed to remain constant throughout the forecast
period.
12.         For the Bomun area a water rate of Won 100 per m3 has been
used, which is 2.5 timos the water rate applying now to comercial water
use in the city.
13.         The following sewerage rates have been used:
(i) Connected houses in Kyongju - Won 20 p m3 of water
consumption;
(ii) Unconnected houses in Kyongju - Won 10 p m3 of water
consumption;
(iii) Hotels and other facilities in Bomun - Won 50 p m3 of
water consumption.
The water consunqtion for connected and unconnected houses in Kyongju
was estimated to be between 200 and 238 m3 per house (averaging about
600 lpd).
14.         Operating costs for both water supply and sewerage are based
on a detailed calculation of personnel expenses, chemicals, electricity
and maintenance costs which appear reasonable.  The following breakdown
illustrates the composition of operating costs in 1982:
Water Supply      Sewerage & Waste
Disposal
(in '000 Won)
Labor cost                 6,300.0             2,000.0
Power & fuel              11,740.0             1,178.0
Chemicals                  3,773.0             8,188.0
Maintenance                7,000.0             4,5000
Other ex7enses (including
solid waste)          2,5200 2C,208.0
Total operat- _      n    -  _.0              36,074.3
The average labor cost per employee was assu:.s  to be ion 25,000 p.m.;
the average electricity rate 5 'don pe- KQd; the unit cos' cf chemicals
Won .49 p m3.  These rates are consbis-Leat with present costs per unit.
15.         Depreciation has beer-          or. a s' r&i t-1ziine baz is as-
suming the following rates for m  o_' azegories e' a&sets,



ANNEX V
Notes t, Tables -
-3-
Civil works               1.5%
Equipment
Water supply            4.0%
Waste disposal         15.0%
Sewerage                3.0%
Pipelines                 2.5%
16.       No depreciation has been charged on the irrigation component
of the Duck-Dong Dam, since the question of irrigation charges still has
to be resolved (Annex IV).  The irrigation component has been tentatively
estimated to be 17% of the total investment in the Duck-Dong Dam; this is
equivalent to a total amount of Won 423.2 million allocated to irrigation.
Balance Sheet
17.       The balance sheet of KCG reflects the total investment in water
supply, sewerage and waste disposal, plus the allocated portion of capital
expenditures on the Duck-Dong Dam.
18.       It has been assumed that KCG would take over both assets and
liabilities for the Duck-Dong Dam after completion in 1977. The total
accumulated Bank disbursements to ADC of Won 751.2 million are therefore
included in KCG's eventual liability for the Bank loan of Won 2,065
million.
19.       It has been assumed that KCG would maintain adequate cash bal-
ances throughout the period and build up an investment fund for future
capital expenditures. This fund would reach a level of about Won 1.2
billion in 1982, roughly equivalent to 50% of the new investment under
the project during the period 1974-78.
20.       It has been assumed that the net balance of inventories and
current liabilities would remain constant throughout the period, while
accounts receivable would increase roughly in proportion with sales
revenue representing about 2½ to 3 months of billings outstanding. In
view of the present 100% collection rate, the conservative estimate of
future revenue and the relatively minor effect on the long-range estim-
ates of any assumed rate of non-collections, no allowance for bad debts
has been made.

KOREA: APPRAISAL OF THE KYONGJU TOURISM PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SUPPLY COMPONENT
A. Scope of the Project
1.          The supply of the Bounu resort complex with electricity
requires as part of the project:
(a)  construction of a transmission line, a transformer
sub-station, and the laying of underground distri-
bution cables within the resort area;
(b) provision of street lighting facilities for public
areas; and
(c)  electrification of five villages located in the
vicinity of the resort area.
2.          The electricity to be supplied by the Korean Electric
Company (KECO) through these facilities to the Bomin resort complex
would be provided from KECO's power plants and would constitute a
marginal increment to the total system demand. KECO is presently
planning to increase its total generating capacity to 6019 MW by
1976, when the mayimum demand of the hotels and other facilities in
the resort area is estimated to be about 7.5 MW, after which it would
increase to 23.4 MW by 1982.
3.          The estimate of electric power demand for hotels was
calculated on the basis of floor areas for rooms and public areas and
for service areas. Based upon present average requirements of hotels
in Seoul the demand for lighting, power and air conditioning is es-
timated to be 120 W per i2 for rooms and public areas, assuming 50 m?/
room, and 145 W per m for service areas, assuking 20 m2 proportional
per room. In addition, the requirements for public facilities, cor-
mercial and residential areas and street lighting were considered
properly.
4.          KECO would be directly responsible for construction of
all facilities under 1 (a) and (e) above, and would also install the
street lighting facilities on behalf of KTA. Whi1e KECO would be di-
rectly responsible for operation of its own facilities, it would main-
tain the street lighting facilities under contract with KTA.
. DescriEtion of the Project
5.          The existing 66 KV sub-station in Kyongju area does not
have sufficient capacity to meet the new demand of the tourism pro-
ject. In addition, the existing equipment is old and out-dated and
the site of the sub-station is subject to occasional flooding.  Long
term development plans of KECO provide for the retirement of this



2it'a g E-
station. Therefore, a new sub-station needs to be erected for the
supply of power to the Bomun Lake area. This station would be loca-
ted between the city of Kyongju and Bomun Lake and would have suffic-
ient space to eventually allow for supplying the city as well as the
tourism project. The portion to be financed within the project is for
the Bom,un Lake area only and it would meet the demand of 231,400 EW es-
timated to be required by 1982. A new 54h IV, double circuit trans-
mission line (only one circuit wil1 be installed initially) 9t.4 km
long wiLl oe built to connect the new sub-station to the existing 154
DV system.
6.          After step-down to 22.9 KV through two units of 15 MVA
transformer, distribution to Bomn Lake area would be by overhead
lines and finally by a system of underground cables within the re-
so   aea     n in addiionl, overhead liaes would be provided for the
electrification of five villages (incl. Silla Village) located in
the I   diate vicinity of the tourism zone.
C. Cost Estimates
7.          It is estimated that the total cost of the electricity
coponent, including the supply to the villages, would be about Won
1.530 million of which the foreign exchange cost would be about Won
819 million. These estimates are based on KECO's unit costs for sim-
ilar systems and appear to be reasonable. A contingency allowance
of l5% for physical increase and of 7% per year for price increases
during the time of construction has been added and should be adequate.
Design costs are estimated at 3% of construction costs and supervision
costs at 6%. Details are given in Amnex I, Table 2.7.
D. Procurement
8.          Local material and equipmnt is usually purchased in bulk
by KECO and then supplied to sub-contractors carring out work on be-
half of KECO. Iported major equipment like transformers switch
gears, etc. would be procured through international competitive bid-
ding. If the total amount of certain items seem to be unattractive
to international bidding procedure, approval of the Ban for other
methods will be sought prior to procurement.
E. Execution of the Project
9.          The executing agency for the power component would be
KECO which usually arranges for work to be carried out by sub-con-
tractors based on competitive bidding. The t"Transmission Substa-
tion Construction Office' of 1ECO is responsible for the construction
of power facilities and woulid desDatch supervisors to the site as re-
quired. Upon completion of± the construction, KECO would also be re-
spons'ble for the operation aad maintenance of the power facilities.
Individual consumers would then enter into supply contracts with KECO.



ANNEX VI
Page 3
F. Administrative and Financial Arrangements
10.         During the construction phase, KECO's activities with re-
spect to the project would be closely coordinated with those of other
agencies under the general supervision of KDO's project unit. After
the completion of construction, KECO would enter into supply contracts
with iridividual consumers in accordance with its existing regulations.
11.         KECO's electricity supply regulations provide that the
total construction cost for supply of general services and high tension
service shall be borne by KECO except that any amount in excess of
stipulated costs per KW shall boe contributed by the consumer and shall
be partly reimbursed by means of a reduction of electricity charges.
It is proposed that KECO would avail itself of this provision in its
regulations to the extent that it is providing underground distribution
facilities specifically for the Bomun resort area.
12.         KTA, although not being the only ultimate consumer, would
assume the responsibility of making the required capital contribution.
The net contribution, in the amount of about W 814 million, would con-
stitute deferred charges which KTA would need to amortize against reve-
nue from the hotels in the form of annual charges and lease rents (see
Annex VIII). In addition, KTA would be solely responsible for finan-
cing of small lighting facilities and village electrification.
13.         The existing regulations of KECO would thus require KTA
to contribute about 93% of the distribution component of the electri-
city supply facilities to KECO as consumer contribution. This con-
tribution would in part be financed by the proceeds of the Bank loan.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that appropriate arrange-
ments between KECO, the Government and KTA would be made to ensure that:
(a) KECO would charge customers in the resort area for
electricity supplied in accordance with its regular
tariff schedules; and
(b) KECO would receive a capital contribution equivalent
to the additional cost of providing distribution
lines other than those normally provided under its
existing regulations.

G. Financial Position of KECO
14.         KECO, which was formed on July 1, 1961, as a result of the
merger of three electric utilities, is the national corporation respon-
sible for generation, transmission and supply of electricity in Korea.
A sumuary of basic data on its financial position, existing facilities
and scope of operations, is given in Table 1. KECO is operating under
auathority of the Korea Electric Company Act of 1961, and is owned partly
by the Government (more than 50%) and partly by other institutions and
private individuals.  Foreign loans have been obtained from the Kredit-
anstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (NfW) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
So far there have been no loans from the Bank to KECO.
15.         Under existing loan agreements with foreign lending in-
stitutions, KECO is obligated to consult them in case of changes in
the level of electricity tariffs; there is, however, no specific rate
covenant requiring minimum rates of return. Assets are revalued an-
nually by special law.
16.         KECO's present tariffs produce a rate of return on its
overall net fixed assets in operation of about 7.0%. This has been
barely adequate during the last few years to achieve a marginal net
profit, even though the Government has provided interest subsidies
to offset the high interest on local bank loans.
17.         KECO's main problem has been its inability to raise
equity capital and to generate sufficient internal funds to finance
further expansion. For some time to come, debt service on existing
foreign loans alone would absorb most of its internally-generated
fu-ds, while debt service on local loans and capital expenditures are
to be covered mainly by rolling over medium-term local loans and ob-
taining additional foreign loans.
1A.         1ader these circumstances, it is imperative that the elec-
tricity component of the Kyongju Tourism Project -- while representing
only a relatively small portion of KECO's future expansion program --
should not place additional burdens on KECO over and above those inher-
ent in its existing operating framework which the Bank would only be
able to Mnfluence if it were a major source of lending for KECO.
l19         5- ...ry financial projections for the electricity com-
'onent o.f ;Oh. y4sngjn u Tourism Project show that the rate of return
on KECO's 4  rexer.al zivestment to the system would indeed be better
than the present overall rate of return.  These calculations are shown
ia Table 2.

KOREA: APPRAISAL OF THE KONGJU TOURISM PROJECT
ROADS. BRIDGES AND STORM WATER DRAINAGE COMPONENTS
A. ScoP@ of the Project
1.        The Project consists of the construction and/or re-align-
ment of (i) four roads totalling about 23 km in length to provide ac-
cess to various historical and scenic sites; (ii) four roads with a
total length of about 22 km to provide major access to and within the
resort area, and (iii) a secondary road and street network of some 12
km within the resort area itself. The location of these roads is shown
on Map 2.
2.        The Project provides also for the construction of a pro-
per stormwater drainage sstem. for the resort area at Bomun ZIake con-
sisting of open ditches, concrete pipelines of various sizes and out-
lets.
B. Description of the Project
B.. Roads and Bridges
3.        Bomun Road.  This road consists of four different sections:
(a)  The first section of 2.7 km length links the city of
Kyongju with the proposed resort area. From the city
to the entraLce of the lake area it is designed as a
four-lane road with sidewalks on both sides.
(b)  The second section runs from the entrance area along
the southwestern shore of the lake to Chondan-ri
following the existing gravel road. it is designed
as a two-lane road with a 7.0 m wide paved driveway.
The length is 3.63 km.
(c) The third section runs from Chondan-ri through the
proposed resort area on the eastern side of the Bomun
Lake for a length of 3.01 km. As this would be the
center of the development complex this section is de-
signed to have a four-lane driveway and sidewalks on
both sides similar to section one.
(d) The fourth and last section of Bomun Road continues
through gently roLling areas on the northern side of
the lake with a length of 2.75 km connecting with
section one at the entrance to the resort area, thus,



ANNEX VII
Page 2
forming a loop around the lake. Recreational and en-
tertainment facilities are planned for this area. This
section of the road is designed as a two-lane road with
a 7.0 m wide driveway. Sufficient road reserve would be
provided to allow for widening in the future if required.
Bomun Road would require the aonstruction of two small bridges of 15
m and 20 m span and of two larger bridges with a length of 160 m and
of 200 m respectively.
4.        Bomnun Secondary Roads and Streets.  These roads form a net-
work to serve the resort facilities in accordance with the layout plan.
They would be linked and used as accesses to hotel areas, golf course,
marina, traditional Korean restaurant area, etc. Length and width vary
according to the layout and proposed traffic amount.
5.        Access Roads to Historical Monuments
(a) Yongehi Road. This roaa serves as access to a re-
creational area located at the legendary Yongehi, an
old, existing water reservoir formed by, presumably,
the oldest dam in the area not far from the royal
tomb Ioenung. The length is 1.38 km with a width of
7.0 m for two-lane traffic.
(b)  Koenung Road.  The access to the Koenung Royal Tomb
is proposed to be improved to a 7.0 m wide driveway
at a length of 0.56 km with a parking lot for approx-
imately 50 cars.
(c) Namsan Road No. 2. The major section of this 114.1 km
long road passes over Mt. Namrsan through rugged topo-
graphy with steep slopes through a beautiful mountain
area. This road is proposed to give access to numer-
ous historical reahins in the vicinity of Mt. Namsan
and to an existing newly-built look-out. In view of
the difficult terrain a design speed of only 35 km/hr
is used in the geometric design of the two-lane, 7.0 m
wide driveway. The construction of seven small and four
comparative Ly large bridges would be required in connec-
tion with the road construction. Approaching the Bulkak
Road the road passes through flat terrain and cultivated
1La-n. To oross the river running parallel to Bulkuk
load an exibtirg concrete bridge can probably be used
which, at present, is connected to minor tracks only.
(d) Bobuil Road. The proposed road would connect the famous
Bulguk Temple area with the Boinun resort complex.
For a length of 7.12 ;= with a two-lane 7.0 i wide drive-
way the road passes mostly through mountainous terrain.
Shoulders 2.5 m wide are planned for both sides in order
to allow for the possible future provision of sidewalks.



ANNEX VII
Fa'ge 3
(e) Boduck Road. This road would connect Bomun Road (at
Shinpyang-ri) to Duck-Dong North Road and would be de-
signed to accommodate a 7.0 m wide two-lane driveway.
6.        Other Roads.  The following roadworks are required in con-
sequence of the proposed construction of Duck-Dong Dam and reservoir
and their costs have therefore been included in the cost estimate for
the dam. Relocation of some parts of existing roads is necessary as
they will be submerged in the new reservoir.
(a)  Relocation of Road to Kampo.  The 4.04 km long section
is part of the Kyongju-Kampo road and would have a 7.0 m
wide driveway with shoulders on either side. The align-
ment has to follow a relatively steep mountain side.
Four bridges with a span of 60 to 120 m would be re-
quired for this section.
(b) Duck-Dong North Road. This road starts at the proposed
Duck-Dong Dam and runs parallel to the shore of the new
reservoir. It serves as peripheral road and access to
the adjoining area and as a basic road for expansion of
the tourism zone.  As the terrain is mountainous the
design allows for a maximum grade of 10% and a speed of
35 km/hr. The driveway would be 7.0 m wide with 1.0 m
shoulders on either side. The length would be 2.55 km.
(c) Boduck Road (Part). This section is required in con-
nection with the dam construction in order to support
the development of the adjoining area. As described
under item 5(e) it is proposed to have a 7.0 m wide
two-lane driveway for a length of 1.83 km.
B.2 Stormwater Drainage - Bomun Lake Area
7.        As a result of technical and economic studies it is proposed
to provide a stormwater system separate from the sewerage system.
8.        The stormwater drainage would protect the northeastern side
of Bomun Lake where hotels and other tourism facilities are to be con-
structed, and would discharge stormwater into the lake. It would
consist of open drains for the collection of stormwater from the back-
ground of the site, concrete pipe lines, laterals and road-side catch
basins for the collection of stormwater from built-up areas. In order
to avoid (or at least reduce) the content of soil carried by stormwater,
check dams would be provided at inlets of the system at the end of val-
leys and sand traps would be constructed at the outfalls into the lake.
9.        The scheme has been designed in accordance with acceptable
standards based on rainfall statistics collected at the city of Daegu
located close to Kyongju in a similar situation.



ANNgX VII

C. Cost Estimates
10.       The estimated costs of roadworks (including bridees) and
stormwater drainage are summarized in Annex I, Tables 2.1 and 2.6. Cost
estimates were prepared by KECC, consultants to KDO, and were reviewed
during the time of appraisal. Costs are based on Korean cost of goods
and civil works. A price increase allowance of 7% p.a. and a physical
increase of 15% has been assumed, and these provisions should be ade-
quate. Final engineering costs are estimated at 3% and cost of super-
vision at 6% of construction costs plus price increase. The total cost
(including contingencies) is estimated at US$ 9.1 million for road-
works and bridges and US$ 0.7 million for stormwater drainage.
D. Procurement and Project Execution
11.       Contracts for the implementation of roadworks and bridges
would be subject to international competitive bidding. For the storm-
water drainage, however, it seems to be doubtful whether the volume
of work involved would attract foreign bidders and it is therefore
proposed that only national competitive bidding should be required.
12.       KDO, as part of the Ministry of Construction, would employ
consultants to design the project and would be responsible for the
implementation of roadworks, bridges and stormwater drainage. For
maintenance and operation, however, these elements would be taken
over after completion by the Kyongju City Government (KCG).
E. Organizational Aspects
13.       While the Kyongju Development Office (KDO) would be respon-
sible for this component of the Kyongja Tourism Project during the con-
struction period, the Kyongju City Government (KCG) would upon com-
pletion assume responsibility for operation and maintenance of the fa-
cilities.
14.       KCG is maintaining at present national highways, regional
roads and city roads totalling about 122 km. Although these roads in-
clude paved as well as unpaved roads, it can be assumed that the take-
over of the new roads would require only slight expansion of its roads
maintenance activities. During negotiations assurances were ob-
tained from KCG that the roads under this Project would be adequately
maintained and that funds would be provided for this purpose.
F. Financial Aspects
15.       The financing plan (1974-77) for the roads and stormwater
drainage component of the Project can be summarized as follows:

- 4376.3        11.0
The proceeds of the Bank loan and the Government contribution would be
male available to KDO through the Ministry of Construction.
16.       There would be no direct user charges for this project com-
ponent so that maintenance costs would have to be covered from general
tax revenues. The Kyongju City Government is presently responsible for
maintenance of certain national roads, regional roads and city roads,
and it receives a share of central government taxes.
17.       Despite a formal segregation of functions between central,
provincial, county and city governments in Korea, the fiscal autonomy
and the decision-making power below the central government is very
limited- KCG therefore 'as to be regarded as a sub-division of the
central government and, as such, offers no basis for separate assess-
ment of its financial position.

KORSEA
APPrA.TSAL OF THE KXONGJU TOURISM PROJECT
The Proposed Kyongj'u Tourism Agency (MA)
A. Pu  ose and Scpe.of Responsibi liies
1..        The Bonnr. Lake tourist resort area would be administered by a new
organization to be created for the purpose -- the K>yongjlu Tourism Agency
(=A) -- the key staff of which would be part of the project unit in KDO).
1TA would be responsible for maintaining the public areas within the resort
ke.g.,, landscaping, buildings, environmental sanitation and storlater
drainage) and for leasing and/or selling sites and facilities to private
irivestors.  it is proposed that in the initial stages KTALi. would lease shops
in the shopping center and such sports facilities as are envisaged.  These
may subsequently be so'ld to private investors.  Policies regarding the leasing
and sale of hotel sites, to be formulated in consultation with the Ba-nk-, would
be largely conditioned by market factors.  In view of the Government's rather
large investment in infrastructure facilities, and in light of the expectation
of sigiificant increases in land values over time in the Bornm Lake resort
area, it is likely that the rate of return to  Government would be higher in
the long term if thie majority of sites are leased rather than sold.  It was
agreed during negotiations, therefore, that no more than 25% of the Bomn
Lake resort area zoned for hotel construction would be sold, except as the
Bank may otherwise agree.
2.         KTA is envisaged as being a commercially-oriented organization which
is structured to provide management, administrative and maintenance services
in the Bomun Lake resort area. The organization would be staifed With qualified
and experienced technical and administrative officers, including the chiefs
of the Property Management, Planaini  and EngLaeering and Accounaoing and
Finance Divisions. It would alao have a small technical serricas unit, although
the KrA would rely heavily on !aaintenance services to be provided by the various
agencies of the Yyongju City Government.  TLhe maaagement services to be pro-
vided by ErA would primarily inv.o lve land leases land sales and building manage-
men-. The administrative serviles would primarily involve accontinig, procure-
ment and disbursements.
3.         Initially, the nucleus of KTA would exist as part of the Projject Unit
within the framework of KO.  Kay personnel to be hired at an earlr stage would
include the Director of ihA as well as specialis- s i  he  ields of proerty
management, accounting and financec, engineering and promotion. The establish-
aent of VA would take place before the project becomes operational; however,
the nucleus of the organization mast be in place when the Froject Unit becomes
operational.



4.         Daring negot-iatione, assurances were obtained from the Goverrnment
that a statement setting out the purposes, the organizational structure and
Ithe policies of Mk  would be prepared and submitted to the Bank for its
approval by ualy 1, 7974. Agreement was also reached that TA would be
estabLisheC'   a Tna       1975, and tht the appoitment of its key staff
wouuld be made inr Consultation -with the Bank.
B. Proposed Organization
5.         The proposed organizational scheme shown in Chartj 3is based on
the assumpt-ion trat the established city organizations would be used to their
Thullest eXiGent and tnat consultants would be retained by h"1'A in order to
perform spec_al se-   oes.~
6.         It would be the responsibility of the property managemernt division
to establish land plr-ces azaa lease ren;(s, prepare lease and sales agreements,
lease and sell properties, col:lect leass rents, and manage IUA-owned super-
structures.  ;L the preparation of lease aind sales agreements, the division
would have the benefit of legal ad-ice by outside  onsulatants; professional
appraiseis wou-Id support the division  in establishing land values, land prices
and lease rents.  The manag,emer,t of  2A-owried superstructures wo-ld priLarily
involve maintenaiice and arrangements for appropriate space allocations.
7.         The plannzing and enginaering division woUld cansist of an engineer-
ing and a plann-Lng/archiLteotural sect-iona. Its mainr.eponsi_lijes wou-ld be:
(a)  to control the quality of maa-intenzance of' XA-ownec  projects, as well as
privately owned and ooerated superstructures, Xb) 'to enter into agreements
with con-tractors; (c)  to supervise contractors' performances; and (d, to
accep-t completed maintenance and repair wori-s.   he relationships be-ween
this sec;tion and the var-ious agen che s of the City of Vyongju would mainly
concern utility and road maintenance.
8.        TIhe finance and accountr,ng division would be responsible for
procuremenzt, disbursement financial slatsaemnt. and anaiyses. budget coo-
dination, ana accounting,  Divisional budget proposals would be prepared by
the respective deputies and submitt.ed to this division by the otner division
heads.  Overa}l coordJnation of all budgeting activities would be exercised
by the Director.

10.        The general administration division would be responsible for the
overall quality level of services rendered in the resort area and for its
internal security and medical services.
C. Relationships with Other Agencies
11.        The relationships between the City Government and KTA would be
such that the City would provide maintenance services for roads, bridges,
water supply and sewerage systems, solid waste disposal, and stormwater
drainage. Electrical installations within the resort area would be main-
tained by KECO, whilst MC would maintain the telecommunnicatiors installations.
However, as mentioned above, the respective divisions of KrA would be res-
ponsible for the overall quality control of maintenance and repair services,
and would plan their activities in close coordination with the City admi-
nistration.
D. Financial Aspects
Financing Plan
12.        The total project cost for the development of the tourist resort
area at Bomun is estimated at TJS$20.40 million, excluding financial charges
which is about 14% of the overall project cost of US$50.0 million.
The following is a summary financing plan for the development of the
Bomun resort area:

13.       The IMED loan is assumed to be on-lent at 7V5 interest for 25
years, including a five-year grace period. Repayaent of the IBRD loan
of US$ 10.90 million will, therefore, start in 1979, since the first
disbursement will be made in 1974. The financial charges on the IBRD
loan during the grace period will be covered by the Government. They would
be charged to KTA as Government advances, repayable over 20 years.
Operating Projections
14.       Forecasts of income and expense, cash flow and financial position
for the first ten-year period of KTA's operation are shown in Tables 1, 2
and 3. The basic assumptions used in these projections are summaried below.
15.       KTA would generate revenues from the following three major sources;
the sale and leasing of hotel sites; the leasing of other properties, such
as shops, restaurants, game center, golf course, etc.; and provision of
maintenance and other services, for which charges will be made. It was
assumed that 25% of the land set aside for hotel sites would be sold and
the rest would be leased. Average land sales prices of US$ 40 per a2 and
average annual lease rants of US$ 350 per rsom for hotel have been assumed.
Rents for other superstructure establishments were projected at appropriate
percentages (1.5% - 2.0%) of their expected gross revenues. Annual service
ciharges were based on the projected gross operating profits of hotels and
other establishments at relatively conservative rates (1.5% - 5.0%).
16.       The operating costs include maintenance of the infrastructure
facilities in the resort complex, promotional and administrative activities
for the resort, and a small amount (UJS$ 25,000 per year) paid to local
agricultural conmittees as rent for the use of Bomun Lake. On the basis
of a depreciation schedule for the various project components to be built
in the resort, the annual maintenance costs were estimated at an average of
0.7% of the depreciable total sssets. The promotional expenses and adminis-
tration costs were based on assumed work programs for these activities.
Average depreciation on total assets, excluding the cost of land was cal-
culated at 2.4% per annum.
17.       The Government would, on behalf of KTA. make development con-
tributions to EGG and KECO. These contributions would be treated as de-
ferred expenses by KTA. Total deferred expenses including project ad-
minstration, promotional expenses and financial charges during construction
would amount to Won 1.5 billion.  KTA is expected to recover this amount
through its charges to the hotels, including the sales proceeds of developed
lots, within about tax years.



ANNEX VIII
Page 5
18.        On the basis of the above assumptions, and given the conservative
revenue projections made, KTA's financial position would be sound. Despite
some losses in the years 1979-80, the financial rate of return (net income
before interest as a percentage of total net assets) reaches 7.1% by the
time full utilization of the hotels is achieved in 1984.   The debt service
coverage shown in the cash flow projection is quite satisfactory.
19.        In addition to the financial return to KIA in its operation of
the resort, the Government is expected to receive substantial tax revenues
from hotels and other superstructures. Over the period to 1998, the total
tax revenue is estimated to amount to at least US$ 90.0 million in 1973
prices.
20.        Because of the nature of IrA's operation, the financial proJections
do not represent standards of performance which can be regulated by financial
covenants such as a rate of return requirement.   During negotiations agreement
was therefore reached that grA would formulate in agreement with the Bank
financial objectives and regulations governing lease rents, sales prices
and service charges. In addition, KTA would have its accounts and financial
statements for each fiscal year audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank.
