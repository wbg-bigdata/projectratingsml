INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A TOURISM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation of a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$25.0 million to
help finance a tourism project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including seven years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report ("Economic Situation and Prospects
of the Republic of Korea" EAP-33a) was distributed under cover of R72-243,
dated November 9, 1972. The Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
An Economic Mission was in the field during September-October 1973, and
is now preparing its report.
3.        Korea's economic record during the last decade has undoubtedly
been one of the most impressive among the developing countries. The GNP
growth, in constant 1970 prices, averaged 9.5 percent per annum during
1963-72 and average per capita income during 1972 at around $300 was in
real terms more than double the level of ten years ago. The unusually
rapid increase in per capita income was, of course, mainly due to the
large gains in output but it was facilitated by a sharp decline in the
rate of population growth from nearly three percent in the early sixties
to less than two percent at present. A key element in the rapid expansion
of the Korean economy has been the growth of manufactured goods exports
from less than $10 million in 1962 to $1,365 million in 1972. Manufactured
exports which provide 85 percent of merchandise exports, now constitute
about 25 percent of manufactured output. The structural change in the
Korean economy is also highlighted by the sharp rise in the ratio of
manufacturing output to GNP which now stands at 26 percent and exceeds
the share of agriculture. Under the impetus of sharply rising manufactured
goods exports, the ratio of exports to GNP rose steadily to 22 percent
in 1972 as compared to less than 4 percent a decade earlier. At the same
time real investment has shown phenomenal growth; the ratio of fixed
capital investment formation to GNP which was only around 9 percent
during 1960-62 rose to an average of about 23 percent during 1970-72.
4.        The rapid growth which has transformed the Korean economy
from the sluggish agricultural-rural pattern of the post-Korean war years
to the dynamic semi-industrialized pattern of the present has not, however,
been without its problems. Korea began to face serious resource management
problems toward ths end of the sixties because the heavy investment required
to sustain rapid economic growth was well beyond her own saving capability.
The savings-investment gap, which was quite large to begin with (foreign



savings averaged 7-8 percent of GNP during 1964-66), widened towards the
end of the sixties to 11-'2 percent of GNP. Even though the marginal
savings rate during the last decade was close to 25 percent, the deficits
on the goods and services account expanded rapidly and had to be financed
by large external borrowings. The ratio of debt service payments to
foreign exchange receipts increased rather sharply during the sixties
to reach the peak of 19.4 percent inh 1971 due, in part, to excessive
reliance on suppliers' credits during 1965-70. During 1970-72, the Govern-
ment took a number of measures to reduce the rate of increase of investment,
to curb further expansion in foreign capital requirements and to improve
generally the balance of payments. These measures included the gradual
adjustment of the exchange rate from around 300 Won per US dollar in the
beginning of 1970 to 400 Won per US dollar by the middle of 1972, restric-
tions on suppliers' credits and limitations on the expansion of domestic
credit. They produced a definite slowdown in the economy; the GNP growth
averaged only 8 percent per annum during 1970-72 compared with nearly
12 percent per annum in the preceding three years. Real investment
stagnated during 1970-72 and the ratio of fixed investment dropped
sharply from 27 percent of C?P in 1969 to 21 percent in 1972.    The
general economic slowdown did not, however, result in an abatement of
inflationary pressures and the Government therefore took a series of
further measures to check inflation and, at the same time, to moderate
the disruptive financial impact of the economic slowdown on the business
sector.
5.        The impact of thesc stabilization measures on reducing inflation
as well as on business attitudes about future price levels has been very
considerable. External factors have also played a crucial role during
the last twelve months in mitigating the financial strains of the past few
years.
6.        Even by Korean standards, 1973 promises to be an exceptional
year and may rival 1969 in setting new records of growth rates in GNP,
exports and investments. According to the Economic Mission's provisional
estimates real GNP growth during 1973 may be as high as 15 percent. The
major factors in the sharp upturn of economic activity since the second
half of 1972 have been an unprecedented growth in exports, and more
recently, a marked revival in fixed investment. Merchandise exports
during 1973 may rise by 65-75 percent compared to last year. It seems
that at least one third of the gain in the value of exports in 1973 is
due to higher prices reflecting both worldwide inflation and further decline
in the value of the US dollar. But the gain in export volume may be as much
as 50 percent. Exports to Japan in the first half of 1973 were nearly
200 percent higher than in the corresponding period of 1972. Exports to
Europe have also expanded very fast since 1971 and exports to the US have
also expanded. Real fixed investment, which showed very little increase
during the last three years, will probably increase by 30 percent this
year. The national saving rate, which had dropped to about 15 percent
in 1972, is also likely to recover to around 17-18 percent, the level



reached in 1969. Even though the steep rise in import prices of food-
grains, raw materials and fuels and a sharp expansion in machinery imports,
will result in an unparalleled import growth of 65 percent during 1973,
the goods and services account deficit will be only in the order of 6 per-
cent of GNP compared with 11 percent in 1970-71.
7.        It is noteworthy that record economic expansion has been ach'neved
with less inflation than in 1970-72. Wholesale prices, according to
official statistics, were in September 1973 about 6 percent higher than a
year ago. However, in view of the extensive price controls, official price
indices understate the extent of price pressures. Furthermore, since
August the price increases have accelerated and for the calendar year 1973
a rise in the wholesale price index of 8 percent is likely. But the
upheaval in the world commodity markets in the first half of 1973 and the
persistence -- even acceleration -- of price pressures in the U.S. and
Japan, Korea's major trade partners, have resulted in considerable imported
inflation in Korea. Tnese developments could not have been foreseen when
the target of limiting price increase to 3 percent was adopted last year as
a part of the August 3 package.
8.        The remarkable performance of the economy in 1973 has quite
evidently increased the conf.dence both in business and Government with
which the future is viewed. However, there is a degree of uncertainty
about how the possible downturn in international economic activity and
continued inflationary pressures will affect the course of the Korean
economy during 1974.
9.        Nevertheless, in light of the recent trends, the Government
plans to pursue vigorously i.s long-term targets of $1,000 per capita
income and $10 billion exports by the early 1980s. The long-term strategy
envisaged is essentially an extension of the growth path Korea has so
successfully followed in the past decade. The overall growth rate of
GNP of about 10 percent, achieved during the sixties, is to be maintained
over the next ten years. This is to be achieved, as in the past, through
a more rapid expansion of exports than that of GNP. The ratio of exports
to GNP is projected to rise to 30 percent by 1981 compared to less than
17 percent in 1972. The manufacturing sector which is expected to provide
the bulk of the increment of exports is expected to contribute 40 percent
of the increment of total output between 1972-1981 (compared to less than
25 percent during 1962-72) and will also absorb 40 percent of the total
fixed investment (compared to about 20 percent in the past).
10.       There are, however, two notable differences from the past pattern.
The strategy aims at major shifts both in the structure of manufacturing
output and exports. Major expansiqn of shipbuilding, steel, petrochemical
and electronic industries is planned and the exports of these products
(amounting to less than $250 million in 1972 of which more than half was
in electronics) are expected to rise to about $5 billion by 1981. In
addition, substantial expansion in exports of industrial machinery, motor
cars as well as of the -,rsent1', dominant exports, such as textiles, ply-
wood and footwear, is also planned. The other major difference in the
strategy compared to the past- 9 _  he aim to reduce sharply the dependence



- 4 -
on net inflows from abroad. This is in sharp contrast to recent trends;
during 1968-72 foreign savings financed over 40 percent of total investment.
11.       The Economic Mission's tentative view is that the general thrust
of Korea's development strategy is correct. The overall export expansion
which is planned does not appear unrealistic, given past performance,
current competitiveness and Japanese business' interest in shifting some
industries abroad.   In general, the shift to heavy arc chemical industries
also appears to be justified though the priorities within the program need
to be defined more sharply. The developments during the current year also
suggest that the potential expansion of light industry exports may have
been underestimated. The Economic Mission was in the field before the
recent developments affecting oil supplies took place. The availability
of oil and the prices at which Korea can obtain it during the next few
years will obviously have crucial implications for the prospects of
achieving the growth targets mentioned in paragraph 10 above; however,
the Mission has not, as yet, been able to form a judgment on the likely
effects of oil shortages, and higher oil prices, on the Korean economy
over the next few years.
12.       The external capital requirements of the long-term program
(1973-81) appear to have been greatly underestimated by the Government.
Even on the assumption that the marginal savings rate will improve sharply
during the seventies compared with the sixties, Korea cannot hope to close
the resource gap by 1981 while pursuing high rates of growth of GNP. The
external resource requirements would be particularly heavy for the period
1974-1978. The gross borrowing requirements during this period might turn
out to be in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion annually compared with the
earlier estimates of $900 million. But even with higher requirements and
higher external borrowing, the debt service ratio which is likely to come
down to 12-13 percent during 1973 is not likely to exceed 15 percent in the
remaining part of the seventies, provided exports rise as expected.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KOREA
13.       As of October 31, 1973, Korea had received 12 Bank loans and
8 IDA credits, amounting in total to US$417.5 million in loans and US$106.9
million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the refinancing of
one IDA credit in a subsequent Bank loan).
14.       Of the USS525.4 million. about one-half has been the transport
sector - US$119.7 milliion fcr railways, US$54.5 million for highways and
US$80 million for ports. The Korean Development Finance Corporation (KDFC)
has received US$95 million in 3ank loans for relending to private industry.
US$117.5 million has gone to agricultural projects - US$93 million for
irrigation projects, US$7 million for 14vestock development, US$10.5 million
for the provision of medliui - and long-term. credit through the National
Agricultural CooperatIve 7eceration and UJS$7 million for seeds producti6n.
The balance of U;S$57.    l ml -  a, 2*L  t ie e6ucation sector.



15.       IFC has made four investments in Korea and its commitments amount
to US$3.4 million in loans and shares. 1/ IFC made its first equity invest-
ment in KDFC, of US$0.7 million or 14 percent of KDFC's paid-in capital,
at the time the Bank made its first loan to KDFC. In 1971, IFC purchased
US$0.6 million of the shares of the Korean Investment and Finance Cor-
poration - a new institution whose function is to assist in the development
of the capital and money markets. The Executive Directors approved on
July 24, 1973 the exercise of preemptive rights to purchase at par about
US$355,000 equivalent of KDFC's common stock. Prospects for further iFC
investments in Korea are good.
16.       Of total Bank and IDA lending, about US$343 million remain un-
disbursed as at October 31, 1973. This is mainly due to the fact that
withdrawals have not yet commenced under several large loans made within the
past year.
17.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Loans, IDA credits,
and IFC investments as at October 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects. As indicated in the notes, progress on project imple-
mentation is generally satisfactory, although difficulties have been
encountered with some projects and most seriously with the Pyongtaek-
Kumgang Irrigation Project (L.oan 600-KO).
18.       The Bank's program for FY1974 tentatively includes five projects.
Of these, a loan to help finance the expansion of seed production was
approved in October. A second highway project, has been appraised and
should be presented to the Board in the next few weeks. The other two
projects (an agricultural products processing project and a secondary
cities development project) have just been appraised. This program is
in accord with a major objective of the current Third Plan viz, the narrow-
ing of the income gap between the urban sector and the rural sector through
increased agricultural investments. The proposed agricultural products
processing project will aim zt increasing on-farm and processed production
of agricultural commodities through the provision of credit to farmers,
packers and processors. The proposed secondary cities project will assist
in the development of the Kwangju area, which is a poor, agricultural
region in the southwest of the country. Bank assistance for the develop-
ment of this area has so far focused on agriculture through the Yong San
Gang river basin project (Loan 795/Credit 283-KO) and on transport develop-
ment through completion of sections of the Chonju/Busan national highway
linking Kwangju and Suncheon with the national primary highway system.
The tourism project under consideration will assist in the implementation
of the next stage of the Government's regional strategy. The primary
purpose of the proposed project is to develop the tourism potential of the
Kyongju area.   However, it will a;so expand the water supply system and
provide a sewerage and solid wasLe disposal system for the existing City
of Kyongju. The construction of a dam to provide a source of water for
1/   A fifth in.t.esttient ir the Atlas Paner Co. amounting to US$5 million
was canceiled at the request of tne company.



- 6 -
the proposed tourist resort will also help to control flooding in the area
and will enable irrigation of an additional 1,200 ha. of land.
19.       The emphasis on agricultural and rural development will be
reflected in the operations program for the succeeding years FY1975 and
FY1976. The report of the agriculture sector mission, which has recently
been discussed with the Government, should provide the basis for developing
additional high priority agricultural projects.    A second livestock project,
an agriculture credit project, a forestry project and the second stage
of the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project have already been identified.
20.       The other major emphasis in Korea's Third Plan, which is
supported by the Bank's economic analysis, is the transition from light to
heavy industrial development. The Bank's lending to industry in Korea has
been through the KDFC; the possibility of Bank lending to another financial
intermediary, the Korean Development Bank (KDB), is under active consider-
ation.
21.       The development of the industrial and agricultural sectors will
require concurrent infrastructure development. Although the transport
sector will be given less emphasis than in the past, the investments
required are large and thus there is considerable support for this sector
in the program.
22.       Korea's long-term development strategy, especially as regards its
plans for increased investments in agriculture and infrastructure, will
require greater efforts on the part of the Government to prepare more
projects suitable for external official finance. The success of the
strategy will also be heavily dependent on the willingness of official
lenders to finance larger amounts of local currency expenditures, at least
until an adequate number of projects is develop to facilitate the flow of
foreign exchange required for the new investment program.
23.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt
(disbursed) oustanding at the end of 1971 was 3.8 percent, and the share
in the debt service was 0.6 percent in the same period. If the Bank
Group1s average annual rate of the lending of the past three years continues
(US$115-120 million), its share in the total amount of external debt out-
standing will increase to about 7 percent by 1976.
24.       The Consultative Group continues to be active.    Bilateral assis-
tance to Korea increased from $71 million in 1966 to $281 million in 1971,
with the U.S. and Japan being the principal donors providing some 97 percent
of the total bilateral assistance of $898 million during the 1966-71 period.



-7-
PART III - THE TOURISM SECTOR
Growth of Tourism
25.       International tourism in Korea is at an early stage of develop-
ment. Despite the country's scenic beauty and its many sites of historical
and archeological importance, Korea attracted very little real vacation
traffic before the late sixties. Until recently, Korea was not on estab-
lished travel routes normally taken by European and American vacationists
visiting the Far East or on Pacific tours; there were only a few hotels
of international standard and the country's historical and cultural
attractions had not been developed. Visitors averaged about 42,000 &nnually
in the mid-sixties; about half of these were Americans, mainly on business
or official duty. Of the remainder, the large majority were expatriate
Koreans visiting their families. There was little genuine vacation traffic.
216.      The tourism sector has, however, expanded vigorously in recent
years. The number of foreigners taking vacations in the country rose from
less than 19,000 in 1966 to over 210,000 in 1972, growing at an annual
average rate of 50 percent during the period. The last two years have
seen an accentuation of this trend - more than twice as many foreigners
visited Korea on vacation last year than in 1971. The most important factor
contributing to the growth of the sector has been the large increase in
the number of Japanese tourists from about 41,000 in 1970 to 80,000 in 1971
and further of the increasing amount of vacation travel undertaken by the
Japanese since the mid-1960's as a consequence of their country's economic
prosperity, the progressive liberalization of its overseas travel restrictions
and the improvement in communications between Japan and Korea. Total
Japanese visits abroad rose from 214,000 in 1966 to 1.4 million in 1972;
a growing share of this total has gone to Korea (from 8 percent in 1966 to
16 percent in 1972).
27.       Travel receipts on the invisibles account increased from US$7.7
million in 1965 to US$31.2 million in 1971 or 6.5 percent of total receipts
on invisibles. Tourist receipts are expected to become the dominant source
of revenue from invisibles in the next decade, as travel income is expected
to average about US$200-250 million a year or 20 percent of total invisible
receipts in the 1972-76 period and about US$350 million or 30 percent in the
next five-year period. By 1981, travel income may be as much as 40 percent
of all invisible receipts, second in importance only to transportation and
insurance.
28.       The number of Japanese vacationing abroad is expected to rise even
more rapidly in the remainder of the seventies. Recent estimates indicate
that there may be as many as 10 million Japanese tourists holidaying overseas
every year by 1980. The bulk of this travel is expected to be confined to
the Far East, Southeast Asia, Micronesia and the South Pacific. Korea is
likely to be a popular choice among these destinations because: (a) of its
proximity to Japan and the low transporation costs involved - the return air
fare from Tokyo to Seou or Busan is lower than that from Tokyo to a city



-8-
in any other foreign country, (b) the low price levels obtaining in Korea
relative to Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and other neighboring countries;
and (c) the unique historical monuments in Korea, which predate those of
Kyoto and Nara and are of interest to the Japanese. Continuing growth is
also expected in the number of visitors from the US and other countries.
Role of the Private Sector
29.       Tne Korean private sector has responded to che opportunities
afforded by the recent and anticipatec growth of tourist travel. Capacity
in hotels designed to standards required by foreign visitors has been in-
creased by over 40 percent during the past two years and hotel capacity
is expected to expand by a further 5,000 rooms by the end of 1975.    The
attractive financial returns expected are enhanced by five-year income tax
holidays, exemption of customs duties on imported materials and provision
of basic infrastructure by the Government to encourage investment in hotels.
Services provided by both Korea Airline (KAL) and foreign airlines have been
expanded considerably to accommodate the growing number of visitors to
Korea of whom 90 percent arrive by air.   Also, Seoul's Kimpo International
Airport is being expanded and Busan's airport is being relocated, which will
permit its enlargement to cope with the increasing air traffic.
Government Policy Towards Tourism
30.       The Government is placing considerable emphasis on the development
of the tourism sector. It realizes the importance of tourism as a foreign
exchange earner and it recognizes that many areas of tourism potential are
located in the poorer regions of the country and that their development could
contribute substantially towards the alleviation of the regional income
disparities, which is one of the major aims of its policy. A special depart-
ment was established in the President's Secretariat to coordinate the efforts
of public agencies and to formulate long-term policy for the growth of the
tourism sector. This department is supervising the preparation, with assistance
from USAID, of a comprehensive national tourism study, which aims at developing
a framework for the long-term development of this sector. The Government's
preliminary review of opportunities for tourism development led to the
conclusion, with which the Bank concurs, that prospects for developing a
tourist resort at Kyongju were so promising that the proposed project should
be implemented without awaiting the completion of the long-range study. Also,
the Government has decided to proceed with the preparation of a Master Plan
for tourism development on Cheju Island, which has been identified by both
the Government and the Bank as possessing significant potential for attracting
tourists. Consequently, the conduct of a feasibility study to determine the
justification for the construction of a resort on Cheju Island similar to the
one at Bomun Lake will be undertaken as part of the proposed project. Also
the Government, with assistance from UNDP and ILO, is sponsoring a training
program to increase the number of qualified personnel for employment in the
tourism industry.
31.       In early 1972, the Government established the Kyongju Development
Office (KDO) to finalize the Mester Plan for the development of the Kyongju
region's tourism potential.    ThLe Office is administratively part of the



-9-
Ministry of Construction but reports directly to the special department in
the President's Secretariat. The latter has effectively coordinated the work
so far performed by KDO and other Government agencies on the preparation of
the proposed project. The Government believes that it would be advisable
to establish a new entity to administer the new tourist resort at Kyongju.
This will be called the Kyongju Tourism Agency (KTA).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       In 1971, the Government asked the Bank to assist in assessing the
potential for developing the tourism industry in Korea. A sector survey
mission visited the country and, on the basis of its findings, agreed with
the Korean authorities that the Kyongju area located in the southeast of
the country offered excellent prospects for atttracting greater numbers of
foreign visitors.  The Bank was actively associated in the evaluation and
subsequent refinement of a Master Plan for the urban and touristic develop-
ment of the area. It was on the basis of this Plan that the proposed
project was formulated by the Government, its consultants and a series of
Bank missions over the last two years. An appraisal mission visited Korea
in April 1973. Its report (No. 251a-KO) is being circulated separately.
Negotiations were held from November 5-9, 1973 with a Government team led
by Mr. Yoon Sae Yang, Senior Secretary to the President.
33.       The proposed project will be the first to be implemented in Korea
for the planned development of an international tourism resort. The select-
ion of the site was based largely on the fact that Kyongju, as the country's
ancient capital and pre-eminent cultural and historic center, is expected
to be of considerable interest to foreign visitors. Further, the area is
one of great natural beauty, has a temperate climate and is easily accessible
by road from Seoul and Busan - the two major entry points into Korea for
foreign visitors.  Kyongju has some unique archeological monuments - e.g. an
observatory built in 634 A.D., which is the oldest of its kind in Asia, a
25-foot high golden Buddha dating back to the eighth century and many other
buildings and shrines of the Silla Dynasty period (58 B.C. to 935 A.D.).
Many of these cultural relics had fallen into decay but the Government has
made an impressive start on restoration work in the last few years.
34.       Kyongju has been visited by tourists both foreign and domestic
in increasing numbers over the last few years but especially since restor-
ation work on the ancient archeological sites began to show results in 1971.
Last year, about 1.2 million Koreans and over 76,000 foreigners visited the
city; of the latter group, only about a half stayed the night reflecting
the severe shortage of hotel accommodation and other tourist facilities.
Detailed Features
35.       The proposed project aims to meet these deficiencies and to provide
the facilities required for the increasing number of visitors expected in the
future. A site at Bomun Lake, some 6 kms., from Kyongju City, has been selcted
for construction of a resort. Most of the land to be developed, which



- 10 -
measures just over 1,000 ha., has been acquired by the Government. The
Government's plan for the development of the area envisages the construction,
over a twenty-year period, of hotels with 6,000 rooms, condominia, apartment
buildings, youth hostels and camping sites. The first phase of the development
of the Bomun Lake resort, of which the proposed project is a part, consists
of the building of hotels with a 3,000-room capacity and the provision of
utilities, services and recreatiorLal facilities for the complex.   The first
phase is to be completed by 1982; its principal components are the construction
of: a ring road around an existing artificial lake; a street network inside
the residential area; hotel sites parallel to the shore; sites for traditional
restaurants; an amenity core, which will include shops, theaters, and
community facilities such as a fire station and health clinic; and recreational
facilities such as a sports ground, a marina and a golf course. The Govern-
ment will finance the infrastructure for the resort as well as certain build-
ings and services. The bulk of the land area will be subdivided into
individual lots for the construction of hotels, recreational activities and
commercial development by private investors. The activities of private
investors will be guided and regulated by the Kyongju Tourism Agency (KTA),
which is expected to be established within a year.
36.       The proposed development of basic infrastructure for the Bomun
Lake resort area affords a good opportunity to provide for a number of
improvements which will raise the standard of living in five adjacent villages
at relatively small incremental costs. These improvements would consist of
rural water supply, environmental sanitation, electrification and street
lighting, street improvements, telephone connections and small elementary
school which would serve all five villages. The villages involved are Buk
Gun, Son Gok, Chong Dan, Chun Gun and a traditional Silla village which the
Government intends to restore and open for tourists who wish to see folk arts
and sample traditional Korean food.
37.       A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III of this report.
A map showing the main features of the development of the Bomun complex and
its vicinity is also attached. The main components of the proposed project
are summarized below:
a)   A Multi-Purpose Dam and Irrigation System will be built
at Duck-Dong, upstream from the Bomun Lake, to create a
reservoir to stabilize the water level in the lake and
provide sufficient water for the new resort as well as
the increasing needs of Kyongju City. Further, the
doubling of the land area irrigated from Bomun Lake
(presently around 1,200 ha.) should be possible upon
completion of the reservoir.
b)   The Water Supply System.   At present the source of supply
for the water works at Xyongju City is the Hyung San
River. No reliable flow records are available, but the
river sometimes goes dry in the summer, causing shortages.
It is therefore, inadvisable to plan, in the long run, on
supply-3n- both the Cfty and the new resort area from this
source alone. However, groundwater exploration is underway



in the area and may provide an additional source to stabilize
the water supply in the dry season for the resort. A new
treatment plant is under construction at Kyongju and could
be used, at least for a few years, to provide water for the
City and the Bomun Lake resort, In the long run, when
demand outstrips the supply of water from these sources, it
is intended that a new plant be installed at Bomun to treat
water taken from the Duck-Dong Lake. If the groundwater
tests indicate that there would be sufficient water from
this source to stabilize the supply, the installation of
the Bomun plant would be deferred until the demand for water
justifies it.
c)   The Sewerage System for the Bomun Lake complex and Kyongju
will be interlinked and a common treatment plant for both
localities is envisaged. At present, Kyongju City has no
sewerage system and the river has become polluted near the
existing water intake. Solid waste from both the Bomun resort
and Kyongju will be collected, segregated and disposed of in
a sanitary fill at Kyongju. Eight new collection trucks
are to be procured from the proceeds of the proposed loan.
d)   Electricity, Telep-one, Telegraph and Telex Facilities for
the Bomur. Lake area will be installed. Five villages
located in the vicinity of the resort area will also be
provided with electricity.
e)   The Construction and/or Realignment of Roads totaling about
57 kms. in length to provide access to various historic and
scenic sites as well as to the Bomun Lake area, and forming
network within the complex itself, will be undertaken.
The project roads are marked on the attached map.
f)   Tourism Infrastruct ire consisting of storm water drainage
networks, environmental sanitation of the Bomun Lake Basin,
earthworks along the Shin Pyong River, community facilities,
an 18-hole golf course and clubhouse, landscaping of the
resort area and surroundings and lighting for resort area
roads and streets will be constructed.
g)   A School for training hotel personnel designed to accommo-
date 250-300 students will be established. It is expected
that some 7,000 trained employees would be required for the
hotels and other resort facilities when they are fully
operational in 1982.
h)   A Feasibility Study for the development of tourism on Cheju
Island will be undertaken. The island is situated in the
East China Sea, roughly 400 kmls. southwest of Busan.  Its



- 12 -
mild climate during the winter and its attrative beaches
offer potential for the development of international tourism.
The possibility of constructing a resort similar to the
one proposed for Bomun Lake is being considered by the
Government.
Organizational Arrangements
38.       The responsibilities for implementing the project will rest with
six Government agencies. The Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC)
will build the Duck-Dong Dam and the related irrigation works.' The Kyongju
City Government (KCG) will be responsible for the construction of the water
supply, sewerage, and solid waste disposal systems of both the City and the
Bomun Lake resort. The Korean Electricity Company (KECO) will construct and
operate the electricity facilities of the project. The Ministry of Communi-
cations (MC) will install and operate the telecommunications facilities (which
will not be financed by the proceeds of the Bank Loan). The Bureau of Tourism
in the Ministry of Transportation will operate the hotel training school.
The Kyongju Development Office (KDO) will be responsible for the implementa-
tion of all the remaining infrastructure work; a project unit, will be set
up in KDO. ADC has gained valuable experience during the implementation of
two Bank-financed irrigation projects (Pyongtaek-Kumgang and Yong San Gang).
KECO and MC are both regarded as efficient in their fields and should be able
to discharge the responsibility entrusted to them under the proposed project
with no difficulty. KCG, the. Bureau of Tourism and KDO have all played
important roles in the evolution of the proposed profect and' have the capacity
to discharge the project responsibilities to be assigned to them. The
special department in the President's Secretariat mentioned in paragraphs 30
and 31 above will co-ordinate the activities of' various agencies concerned
with the project's implementation.
39.       Upon completion of the construction work, KCG will operate and
maintain the dam, the water, sewerage and waste disposal systems and all
project roads. A new entity, the Kyongju Tourism Agency (KTA) will'
administer the new Bomun Lake resort.   KTA is envisioned as a profit-
oriented Government-sponsored organization. It would maintain the public
areas in the resort; it will also arrange for the sale and lease of sites
and facilities to private investors. It is expected that a number of the
hotel investments at Bomun would be made by joint ventures of Korean and
Japanese investors. Such joint ventures have already been responsible for
developing several of the largest new hotels recently completed or now
under construction in Seoul., Considerable interest has been shown by both
Japanese and Korean investors in the Kyongju-Bomun area. The prospects for
hotel investment are considered favorable in view of the good market
possibilities of the,area and the relatively high profitability of hotel
operations in Korea. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes that, from
the point of view of potential investors, the risks of being involved,'in a
new resort are great. Therefore,, it has agreed that it would take all
necessary steps to ensure that a sufficient number of hotel rooms to
make the project'economically viable would be constructed, this is estimated
to be 1,1600 by 1982. Ultimately, KTA will consist of four departments with
responsibilities in the fields of property management, planning and engineer-
ing, accounting and finance, and technical services.   A statement outlining



- 13 -
KTA's functions and responsibilities is under preparation. The Governme-.t
intends that KTA will be operational by the beginning of 1975. Its key
staff will be drawn from the project unit to be initially set up in KDO.
Cost and Financing
40.       A. breakdown of the cost estimates for the proposed project is
given in Annex III. The estimated totaL project cost is US$50.0 million
equivalent with the foreign exchange comnponent of US$21.0 million (42
percent of total cost) equivalent. The proposed Bank loan of US$25 million
equivalent would cover 50 percent of the total project cost. ADC, KCG
and KFCO will receive portions of the proposed Bank loan as tabulated in
the Financing Plan included in Annex IIt. Subsidiary loan agreements
acceptable to the Bank specifying the terms and conditions appropriate
for the particular project components to be financed, are to be concluded
between each of these agencies and the Government as a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan. These terms and conditions were discussed
during negotiations and the preliminary understandings reached are reflected
in Annex III. KTA will repay to the Go,ernment, over a period of 25 years
with 5 years grace at 7.25 percent interest per annum, that part of the
proceeds of the Bank loan expended on the assets transferred to KTA. The
proceeds of the Bank loan will be used to meet the entire foreign exchange
expenditure! and some US$4 million of local currency expenditures. These
estimates are based on the expectation that about US$9.1 million of
major civil, works contracts (roughly 30 percent of the estimated value
of all civil works contracts) would be ,ion by foreign bidders, and that
most equipnment suppliers would also be Foreign. In the event that local
manufacturers won all equipment supply contracts, the local expenditure
financing from the proposed loan would increase by about US$6.5 million
equivalent to USS10.5 million equivalent.
41.        Some 12 percent of the antici-ated expenditure on civil works and
equipment (amounting to US$1.9 million) have been earmarked to meet the
cost of consultancy services required for the final design and the super-
vision during construction of the nroject. These relatively high consultancv
costs are considered justified in view of the specialized services required
for certain components of the project (e.g. the golf course, landscaping,
water supply and sewerage, dam and irrigation works).     Some of the work
on the preparation of the final designs has already been accomnlished by
the Government with the assistance of consultants acceptable to the Bank.
It is recommended that the costs of these services from May 1, 1973 be
financed retroactively from the proceeds of the proposed loan. The amount
involved will be of the order of USS750,000 equivalent (approximately 1.5
percent of total project cost).
Procurement
42.        Contracts for major civil works and equipment will be let in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.     Project items will
be grouped together in order to encourage international competitive bidding.
The Korean construction industrv has the capacity to implement the works to
be undertaken; therefore, it is expected that foreign contractors will
submit bids only for the larger contracts. Smaller contracts like the



- 14 -
civil works and the improvement of the existing villages will probabLy not
be large enough to attract foreign bids. These contracts (expected to
cost below $50,000 individually), will, therefore, be locally tendered;
the total value of such contracts is estimated at about USS2.8 million
equivalent. The responsibility for tenc,ering, bid evaluation and coatract
awards for all works under the project will rest with the Office of Supply
of the Republic of Korea (OSROK) which is the central procurement office
for all Government agencies. OSROK has been responsible for procurement
work under previous Bank loans and is familiar with our procedures. In
bid evaluation, Korean manufacturers of equipment and furniture will be
allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent of the c.i.f. cost of competing
imports or the relevant prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is
lower.
Disbursements
43.       Disbursements from the Loan Account would cover:     (i) 55 percent
of total cost of civil works and associated services, excluding land
acquisition; (ii) 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment,
furniture and materials or of the ex-factory cost of such locally manu-
factured equipment, furniture and materials; and (iii) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures on technical services for the Cheju Island feasibility
study. A schedule of disbursements is :included in Annex III.
Financial Objectives and Forecasts
44.       The Government's basic financ:Lal objective, in respect of the
utilities to be provided under the project, is the recovery of the invest-
ments in the various project components from charges to the beneficiaries
and the achievement of a reasonable rate of return. The prospects for the
fulfillment of these targets insofar as the resort area is concerned, will
be conditioned by the ability of KTA to charge the hotels with the full
capital and operating cost of infrastrut:ture without endangering their
profitabilitv. Insofar as the agricultu-re component is concerned, the
Government will take into account the ahilitv of the farmTers to pay for the
water. This is reflected in the level of water charges which are expected
to provide for the recovery of 40 percent of the original investment at an
interest rate of 3.5 percent per annum over a pe-riod of about 40 years.
These terms are consistent with those of other irrigation projects in
Korea, some of which have received Bank Group financing.     For the water
supply, sewerage and electricity components, charges would be set to meet
the conventional objective of providing the utility entities with reasonable
rates of return on net fixed assets in operation and ensuring the continued
financial viability of these entities through the maintenance of a
satisfactory debt service coverage.
45.       The financial forecasts for water supply, sewerage and waste
disposal operations of KCG show that KCG's Water and Sewerage Division
would be able to achieve satisfactory financial results with rates of



- 15 -
return ranging from initially 7 percent to about 11 percent in 1982. In
making these forecasts, it has been assumed that the Division would repay
to the Government its share of the proceeds of the Bank loan over 20 years
with 5 year's grace at 7.25 percent interest. Because of the favorable
debt/equity ratio (ranging from 43 percent to 29 percent of total capitalization)
the debt service coverage would be 1.7 or better throughout the operational
period. The main assumption made in the forecasts is the application of
water and sewerage charges which would place the burden for the extension
of services to the resort area on the hotels. The assumed water and
sewerage charges for hotels would be 2.5 times higher than those for
commercial users in the city.
46.       During the development period (1977-1981) the assumed direct user
charges would fall short of providing an adequate rate of return. The
Government would therefore, on behalf of KTA, pay to KCG an estimated
amount of Won 512 million (US$1.29 million) over the period in lieu of
additional direct user charges. These payments would be treated initially
as deferred expenses by KTA and would eventually be included in the
calculation of hotel charges. This would ensure full recovery of all
capital and operating costs from the beneficiaries without Government
subsidies and without excessive direct user charges during the initial
period of hotel development. Financial covenants agreed upon during
negotiations set adewuate performance standards for the KOG Water and
Sewerage Division to meet this objective and to allow the Division to earn
the stipulated overall rate of return on the fixed assets in operation,
suitably adjusted for changes in price levels, of 7 percent in the first
four years and 8 percent thereafter. To safeguard the Division's financial
position, it is proposed that it would not incur additional debt or
undertake other expansion during the construction of the proposed project,
without the Bank's approval if its net revenue should be less than 1.5
times the maximum future debt service requirements. Financial forecasts
for the electricity supply component of the project show that by applying
its existing electricity tariffs to the consumers in the resort area KECO
would earn a satisfactory rate of return on its incremental investment,
provided that the extra cost of providing underground distribution facilities
in the resort area would be borne by KTA. Appropriate financial arrangemnets
to achieve this purpose between KECO and KTA were agreed during negotiations.
Benefits and Justification
47.       In estimating the gross benefits that are likely to accrue from the
tourism-related components of the proposed project only the expenditures
which visitors are expected to incur in the Kyongju-Bomun Lake area have
been taken into account. Although some portion of the visitors expenditure
on international and domestic transportation is properly attributable to the
project, this has not been included in the rate of return calculation. The
relevant costs include the capital and operating costs of the infrastructure
to be provided under the proposed project in addition to the capital and
operating cost of hotel accommodations and related facilities in the project
area such as restaurants and entertainment facilities. On this basis and



- 16 -
assumiing an estimated economaic life of the project of 25 years, the
economic rate of return o-.n the investments in the tourism-related
component would be 18.5 percent.
48.       In addition to the Bomun Lake resort facilities, the project
includes investment in watet supply, sewerage and solid waste disposal
system for the City of Kyongju and provides for some infrastructure
investment in several villages near the resort area.    These improvements
would constitute an important benefit to the local population. To the
extent that this benefit is reflected in the water and sewerage charges,
it has been taken into account in the calculation of the rate of return
on the investment in utilities. Other benefits, such as an improvement
in the public health and an increase in property values, are difficult to
quantify and have not been included.
49.       The irrigation component of the project includes that portion
of the dam properly attributable to it together with the investments in
the irrigation system itself. The rate of return on this element of the
project is estimated at 13.7 percent.
50.       If the entire capital and operating costs of the tourism-related
component, the utilities component, and the irrigation component are
measured against the combined gross benefits of these components, the
overall rate of return would be 16.5 percent.
51.       The proposed project is expected to increase Korea's gross
foreign exchange receipts by US$8.4 million in 1976 when the first hotels
are opened and by US$71 million per annum by 1984 when the project is
fully operational. The high proportion of foreign tourists expected to
visit Kyongju and the low import content for operating the tourist
facilities (presently about 1O percent of total operating cost of hotels)
implies that the net foreign exchange earnings from the project will be
high. Allowing for repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors,
the proposed project will still result in a net gain, in foreign exchange,
of roughly $8 million in 1976 and about $63 million in 1984.
52.       The Bomun Lake resort has been planned on a "tourism estate"
concept under which the acti-vizies of private investors will be regulated
by an estate management agency, KTA. This approach is intended to
ensure that the resort area and facilities are used to the best advantage
and that its development proceeds or. a planned and integrated basis.
The project is expected to be fuil'y functional in 1984; by that time,
it is estimated that it will provide direct employment for about 5,400
workers in the hotels and 1,500 workers in other facilities.    Indirect
employment generated in construction, agriculture, handicrafts, transporta-
tion and other services, is difficult to compute accurately but may amount
to 10,000-15,000 persons.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
1.        Loan No. 600         Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project;
US$45.0 million Loan of May 23, 1969
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This is the first major irrigation project constructed in Korea.
It was expected at appraisal that it would irrigate about 35,000 ha. of
land improve drainage and roads, consolidate all paddy fields, bench
upland and reclaim tidal land. The start of construction was postponed
by a major reorganization of the executing agency and delay in hiring
consultants; the project is now one year behind schedule. Detailed designs
for the farm distribution system and land development disclosed that
certain areas included in the project are not suitable for gravity
irrigation. The net irrigable area now appears to be around 28,000 ha.
Project costs are expected to be higher than appraised, mainly due to
higher unit prices. Re-examination of the economic analysis indicates
a reduction in the rate of return from 14 percent to 11 percent using revised
rice prices and around 7 percent if prices expected during appraisal are
used. Disbursement is 58 percent behind even when a one-year postponement
is applied to the appraisal report schedule. Construction, however, is now
progressing satisfactorily, and all work is scheduled for completion by the
end of 1975.
2.        Credit No. 151       First Education Project; US$14.8 million
Credit of June 4, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project comprises: (a) the expansion and equipment of 27
technical high schools, 5 post secondary technical schools and 4 university
teacher training departments; and (b) 26 man-years of technical assistance,
20 man-years of overseas fellowships to support the development of agri-
cultural and/or technical education and to assist educational planning.
Project implementation is about 18 months behind schedule
because, in its initial stage, delays occured in the establishment of
the project unit, the selection and appointment of architects and the
formulation of equipment procurement procedures. The project is now
progressing satisfactorily, but it is expected that because of the initial
delays, it will be completed about one year later than estimated at
appraisal. This may require a postponement of the Closing Date by six
months to June 30, 1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

3.        Loar No. 669         Third Railway Project; US$40.0 million Loan
Credit No. 183       and $15.0 million Credit of May 14, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The bulk of the Loan and Credit was earmarked for the purchase
of specific equipment required, namely, freight cars, diesel locomotives,
telecommunications and trackc maintenance ecuinment.   Progress is generally
satisfactory except for delays in the procurement of some microwave
equipment which caused the Closing Date of the Loan to be postponed from
August 31, 1973 to December 31, 1975.
4.        Credit No. 234       Integrated Dairy Beef Development Project
US$7.0 million Credit of February 11, 1971
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The development of about 700 small and medium-size dairy farms
by providing long-term loans and the construction and operation of two
dairy products processing plants are the principal components of the
project which also includes management and technical services related to
these activities. The project is progressing satisfactorily. To date,
nearly 200 Korean farmers have participated. Following international
competitive bidding, 1,600 dairy heifers have been purchased and a contract
for the supply of dairy processing equipment awarded; planning and
construction of civil works for the two dairy processing plants are well
underway; technical services are being strengthened; and applied research
for livestock production is bringing significant results.
5.        Loan No. 622 &       Second and Third KDFC Projects; US$20.0
Loan No. 735         million and US$30.0 million Loans of
June 26, 1969 and May 17, 1971 respectively
Closing Dates: December 31, 1973 and
August 31, 1975 respectively
These projects are progressing satisfactorily. Both Loans are
fully committed.
6.        Loan No. 769         First Highways Project; US$54.5 million
Loan of June 29, 1971
Closing Date: November 30, 1975
The project includes the construction of approximately 230 miles
of primary national highways between Chonju and Busan; feasibility studies
of about 870 miles; and detailed engineering of an additional 680 miles.
A highway maintenance study is also being undertaken and a national highway
maintenance organization established on a pilot basis in one of the
provinces. Construction is on schedule and within cost estimates.

7.        Loan No. 795         Yong San Gang Irrigation Project:
Credit No. 283       US$33.0 million Loan and US$15.0 million
Credit of February 2, 1972
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
This is the second major irrigation project financed by the
Bank in Korea. It aims at transforming an area with the highest drought
frequency in Korea into one with year-round irrigation and crop diver-
sification. Also there will be increased production of high-value crops.
The Loan/Credit became effective on September 15, 1972. Detailed
surveying and designing are proceeding satisfactorily and construction
has begun on three of the four dams. Cost estimates have increased by
about 19 percent mainly because of right-of-way costs, more damr foundation
grouting than expected at appraisal, and major changes in designs. About
1,400 ha. of additional land have been added to the project through revision
of original canal lines, thereby providing benefits which offset the in-
creased costs. Insufficient funds were budgeted originally for 1973, but the
Government after Bank urging has provided adequate Won financing for the
year so that construction can proceed on schedule. The need for adequate
flnds in future years has been discussed with the Government.
8.        Credit No. 335       Agricultural Credit Project; US$10.5 million
Credit of September 29, 1972
Closing Date: September 1, 1976
This credit supports a three-year lending program for the
development of orchards, agriculture, mushrooms and to encourage poultry
and swine production. A supervision mission visited Korea in July 1973
and reported that the demand for agricultural credit was strong. The
Project still retains the potential to improve farmers' income. However,
due to the poor selection of Kun Cooperatives and the lack of training and
technical services, the Project has so far not been implemented as planned.
Further loans have been suspended, pending proper training of officials at
both NACF and Kun Cooperative levels, together with a more efficient
selection of cooperatives and an improvement in technical services. These
measures have been agreed with the Government and will be implemented over
the next few months. Loans will be resumed thereafter. The Project is then
expected to achieve its stated objective of increasing production and farmers
income. A supervision mission visited the project in November 1973, and is
preparing its report.
9.        Loan No. 863         Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 million
Loan of November 22, 1972
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The main elements of the project are: electrification of lines
in the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives;
the completion of electrification of 350 kms of line running from Seoul
to the northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision
of yard facilities; acquisition of passenger and freight cars; and improve-
ment of facilities for the maintenance and repair of motive power and

rolling stock. The Loan was declared effective on February 26, 1973. A
recent supervision mission reports that the authorities concerned need to
take measures to speed up procurement which is falling behind schedule.
10.       Loan No. 905         Fourth KDFC Project; US$40.0 million
Loan of June 13, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This Loan was declared effective on September 10, 1973.
