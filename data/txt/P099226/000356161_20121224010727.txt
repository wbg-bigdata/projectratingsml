               SOUTH SUDAN RAPID IMPACT EMERGENCY PROJECT

                                       P099226; TF055976

                                   RESTRUCTURING PAPER



1.    The closing date for South Sudan, Rapid Impact Emergency Project (RIEP) (TF055976),
P099226 will be extended from June 30, 2012 to December 31, 2012.

2.       The revised development objective (as of June 2011) of the project is: “to put in place
critical government infrastructure at national and state level; and provide basic pharmaceutical
stocks and learning materials to bridge the emergency situation?. The original grant agreement
for RIEP was signed in November, 2005 for the amount of US$20 million and funded through
the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for South Sudan (MDTF-SS). There was additional funding of
US$7.5m inclusive of a waiver of counterpart funding of US$2 million approved in September
2009 because of the fiscal crisis that the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) was experiencing
at the time. The additional funding was provided to strengthen one of the components and to
support the construction of office space for newly created commissions of GoSS; namely, the
South Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC) and the South Sudan Anti -Corruption Commission
(SSACC).

3.     The performance of the project (P099226) is currently rated moderately satisfactory
because of delays in the implementation of the one outstanding component. Six of the seven
components closed by December 31, 2009 with a satisfactory rating. Only one component is
remaining for ongoing construction of the SSAC and SSACC buildings. A total of US$25.8
million (94%) has been disbursed as of May 28, 2012. The remaining funds are fully committed.
The audit for the year ended December 31, 2011 is in progress. The Interim Financial Report
(IFR) for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 did not indicate any significant financial
management issue. The FM ISR rating is satisfactory.

4.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow completion of the SSACC building and full
expenditure of MDTF-SS resources for the SSAC building by December 31, 2012. Further, it
will help to compensate for the delay in procurement of a supervising firm for the design,
tendering and construction works; and recruitment of contractors for the two buildings.
Procurement for the project has been completed and the Government has an action plan (contract
register) to complete the construction and, therefore, the remaining component of this project by
the proposed closing date.

5.      This will be the fourth extension of the project, and the cumulative extension for this
project will be four years and 9 months.
