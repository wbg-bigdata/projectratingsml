1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Background

1.      The context for the Rapid Impact Emergency Project (RIEP-used interchangeably
with “the Project?) was among the most challenging in the wide spectrum of Bank-
supported projects. The Project was appraised after the conclusion of a civil war that
began in 1955, had a truce from 1972 to 1983, and then resumed until January 9, 2005
when the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of Sudan
(GOS) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) was signed. In total, for
nearly 40 of the 50 years leading up to the RIEP, the area of South Sudan was in a state
of civil war. As a result, almost no infrastructure could be built or maintained outside of
the 1972-83 truce period. The RIEP was prepared shortly after the CPA was signed.

2.      At the time of appraisal, more than half of the population was living below the
poverty line. The report of the “Joint Assessment Mission? (2005) described the country
context: “Key education and health indicators, such as child and maternal mortality and
primary enrolment, are among the worst in the world. Infrastructure is virtually non-
existent, with no paved roads outside the main urban centers, and…structures for service
delivery must be created essentially from scratch.? The lack of road infrastructure made
the delivery of essential goods and services extremely challenging in most and even
impossible in some locations. There was also the challenge of settling internally
displaced persons (IDPs) who had been uprooted during the civil war: “The poverty and
human development situation is further complicated by the enormous displaced
population. Around three million IDPs and refugees are believed to be of Southern
origin.?

3.      Population estimates put the population of the new country of South Sudan at 8.3
million with a density of less than one-tenth that of neighboring Uganda. Sixteen percent
of the population was under the age of five, about one-third was under the age of 10, half
under the age of 18. Literacy rates were low at about 40 percent for males and only 16
percent for females. More than 80 percent of the population lived in rural areas. South
Sudan is landlocked, with an internal road network in exceedingly poor condition. Its
isolation is mitigated by the fact that it is bordered by five countries: Ethiopia, Kenya,
Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic. The
Government of South Sudan (GoSS) relied on oil exports for nearly all of its revenue,
which left it highly vulnerable to pipeline shutdowns by the North (Sudan).


Rationale for Bank Assistance

4.     There were a number of acute needs to which the RIEP could respond. These
needs ranged from shortages of basic health and education supplies, to support in



                                            1
procurement and financial management functions, to the need for buildings to house the
central and state governments.

5.     Weak health indicators and the need for medical supplies. The JAM
described the dire health status in Southern Sudan at the time of appraisal: “High disease
burden (especially infectious and parasitic), and inadequate health services. Children
born in Southern Sudan have a 25 percent chance of dying before the age of 5, and a
mere 25 percent chance of living to the age of 65. The extremely low health care
coverage in poor areas of the country is illustrated by the number of physicians per
100,000 people, which is less than 1 in the South, … compared to 25 in Kenya.? and
“Among children under five, …48 percent in the South suffer from chronic malnutrition
(low weight for age).?

6.      Though non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had supplied some pharmaceuticals and medical supplies
during the civil war, there were chronic shortages throughout Southern Sudan. The
central pharmaceutical warehouse located in Juba did not have a cold room to adequately
store vaccines and temperature sensitive medications. With the integration of the health
systems in Juba, Malakal, Wau and other towns, the GoSS Ministry of Health faced a
shortage of drugs and medical supplies. There was also the need to strengthen
pharmaceutical management systems and several hospitals that were directly managed by
the GoSS Ministry of Health.

7.     School supplies. The JAM described the state of education: “In education,
Southern Sudan had a gross enrolment rate of 20 percent in 2003, and girls accounted for
only one out of four enrolled students. Even these figures hide very high attrition rates,
with as many as half of first grade students not continuing to the next level.? Although
there was a delivery of textbooks to a number of schools in Southern Sudan in 2003, the
availability of textbooks was insufficient for grades P1 through P4 due to the prolonged
war and the returning IDPs. Leading up to the school year in March 2006, textbooks and
teacher’s manuals in Arabic, and other supplies were critically needed. The Minister of
Education agreed that the eventual goal was to provide an English curriculum, but Arabic
language textbooks were needed in the short-term for primary schools to support
education in the Arabic speaking communities and the returning IDPs from Northern
Sudan.

8.      Accounting services. The accounting capacity in MOFEP needed substantial
strengthening. For an interim period of six to nine months, there was a need to recruit an
international accounting firm to provide accounting services as per international
accounting standards and to provide fiduciary assurance until a long-term project
accounting agent could be recruited. Recruitment of this firm was critical to the efficient
processing of a pipeline of projects funded by MDTF that needed to disburse in the near
future.

9.     Weak procurement capacity. GoSS did not have the capacity to carry out the
day-to-day procurement activities nor develop the internationally commercially



                                            2
compliant procurement procedures necessary to ensure transparency and accountability in
the procurement process. Therefore, the MOF needed urgent assistance in establishing
the procurement capacity of GoSS.

10.     Need for support to State governments. Emergency support was necessary to
help with effective “start-up? of the state administrations to ensure that the new state
Governors and their administrations had the ability to communicate with the central
ministries in Juba. After years of conflict and neglect, many of the buildings of the State
governments were not even habitable requiring basic repairs and supplies to become
functional. At appraisal GoSS officials would often have to meet at homes, street corners
and under the shade of trees because there were no useable offices.

11.    Funding from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. Two multi-donor trust funds were
set up, and became operational after the CPA, one for newly autonomous region of
Southern Sudan, the MDTF-SS (used interchangeably with MDTF in this document) and
one for Sudan, the MDTF-NG. The RIEP was funded from the MDTF-SS, which was
created to fund the priorities of the JAM. The SPLM and the GOS requested that the
World Bank be the administrator of their respective MDTFs.1 Projects funded by the
MDTF-SS were approved by an Oversight Committee (OC) and not the Bank’s
Executive Directors (see Section 2.1 for more details).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

12.     The project development objectives (PDOs), as stated in the Final Project
Proposal (FPP), were to (i) restore livelihoods resulting from the long term civil unrest;
(ii) ensure adequate supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for existing basic
health services for the population of Southern Sudan; and (iii) jumpstart the recovery
process in Southern Sudan through the emergency provision of goods and services to
improve government functionality. On page 6 of the FPP, the phrase “particularly
women and children? is added to the PDO (ii). However, the PDO is quoted in all other
documents, including the Grant Agreement, without this phrase in the PDO. At the 2011
restructuring, “the number and percentage of direct beneficiaries who are female? was
added as a PDO indicator. The PDO revised at restructuring, however, also did not refer
specifically to “women and children? beneficiaries. Therefore, the ICR does not consider
this phrase in its assessment of the PDO.

13.     The original project paper did not include a Results Framework; but did list a
number of monitoring indicators in the main text (p. 11). The FPP stated that at the
completion of the project, there would be: (i) improved student-textbook ratios, (ii)
reduced stock outs of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, (iii) connectivity between 10
states and National Government Offices in Juba, and (iv) furnished and equipped
ministries.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

14.     The PDO was revised at the June 20, 2011 restructuring to: “To put in place
critical government infrastructure at national and state levels; and provide basic
pharmaceutical stocks and learning materials to bridge the emergency situation.? Annex
1 of the restructuring paper provided detailed revisions to the key performance indicators
as Table 1 shows. It also provided a somewhat modified version of the original PDO
indicators from what was in the FPP. The indicators were revised for ease of
measurement and relevance to the Project’s interventions. The assessment of the PDO
achievement will be a weighted average of achievement based on percentage of
disbursements that the June 20, 2011 restructuring (88.62 percent).

1.2 Main Beneficiaries,

15.       The Project had a diverse set of activities and a wide range of beneficiaries.

         Pharmaceuticals—people visiting health units, primary health care centers and
          hospitals—with 1,000 health facilities supplied, an estimated 2.5 million patient
          visits
         Learning materials—primary school students, including remote areas, in the ten
          states—Revised – 850,000
         State government officials—State governors and their staff for all 10 states.
         Central government officials—22 ministries originally, 18 revised.



                                                       4
      Public works—local communities in 10 states through a variety of small civil
       works projects (e.g., pit latrines, small roads, market shelters), workers who
       gained temporary employment from working on these projects—Approximately
       650,000 beneficiaries.
      Anti-corruption Commission and Supreme Audit Chamber—supporting better use
       of government resources for the benefit of the general public

1.5 Original Components

16.    The RIEP had the following original six components (with approved MDTF
financing amounts):

Component 1: Supply and Distribution of Pharmaceuticals and Medical
Consumables—US$ 4.6 million

17.    This component was to support the procurement and distribution of
pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and medical consumables for hospitals, health centers, and
health posts in Southern Sudan and the provision of a cold room for the Juba Central
Pharmaceutical Warehouse.

Component 2: Supply & Distribution of Textbooks & Student and Teacher Kits —
US$ 6.4 million

18.    This component was to support the procurement and distribution of approximately
155,000 sets of Arabic Language textbooks, 8,000 teacher’s manuals and 15,000 student
kits (UNICEF provided separate funding for additional student kits) and teacher’s kits for
grades P1 – P4. The school kits were to be developed by UNICEF.

Component 3: Procurement Agent—US$ 1.5 million

19.     Support for contracting (mobilization, fees, reimbursables, etc.) by a consulting
firm experienced in public procurement to work with the GoSS (MOF) to establish a
Procurement Division, and review and revise, where necessary, the procurement
regulations, policies and procedures governing GoSS procurement activities and to carry
out the day-to-day procurement activities of GoSS for a period of two years.

Component 4: Project Accounting Firm—US$ 0.25 million

20.    Support for the sole source contracting (mobilization, fees, reimbursables, etc.) of
a consulting firm (KPMG) experienced in project accounting to work with the GoSS
(MOFEP) to establish the Project Disbursement Unit, for a period of 6 – 12 months until
the long term project accounting agent is hired. The purpose of this Unit was to prepare
and issue the Project Implementation Guidelines and accounting for all project-related
expenditures that were either funded out of the MDTF or pooled with GOSS for a period
of two years. The Unit was also responsible for providing fiduciary assurance to GoSS
and MDTF regarding the use of funds during the period of the contract.

Component 5: Support to the Ten States—US$ 2.5 million

21.    Support for the establishment of the governors’ office through basic renovations,
provision of basic office equipment, (computers and related equipment, copy machines,
and v-sat equipment for communication with the central government in Juba).

Component 6: Furnish and Equip GoSS Offices—US$ 4.0 million

22.    Support the initial procurement and installation of computers and related
equipment, photocopiers, scanners, communication, including V-sat equipment,
generators, vehicles, furniture to functionalize the GoSS offices. The initial procurement
was to supply a basic package of furniture and equipment to enable approximately 90
Director level officials and 180 Deputy Directors in the offices of the President, Vice-
President, and the 22 Ministries to become functional and communicate with the district
governors as well as other ministries.

1.6 Revised Components

New Components

23.      Significant changes to the Project were through amendments to the Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA). The MoA was amended eight times (Table 2), which included the
addition of two components (Table 3) and four extensions to the Project closing date.
The first new component was the Emergency Urban Public Works Programme (Part G)
which was requested by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to fund
short-term employment activities through rehabilitation and upgrade of community
facilities in the ten States. The addition of this component was a substantial expansion of
Project activities, increasing the MDTF/IDA grant amount by 43.8 percent or US$8.76
million, to which the GoSS added US$3.24 million in counterpart funds, for a total of
US$12 million.

24.    The new component completed 142 public infrastructure sub-projects, including
road construction, public toilets, markets, school rehabilitation, drainage works, bus parks,
garbage management, drilling bore holes, and construction of health facilities. The
component’s implementation was based on several guiding principles, including: (i)
Work for cash based on labor-intensive work; (ii) Sub-granting local NGOs; and (iii)
Community-Based Prioritization, which used local steering committees to prioritize
needs by the communities in the 10 states. Under Part G, funds were administered by
UNDP and governed by a MOU between GoSS and UNDP.

25.     The second major additional component was the Support to Commissions and
Independent Agencies (originally designated as Part H of the project, but which was
finally added to Component 6-furnish and equip GoSS offices), for an additional
US$5.50 million. This activity was to fund the building of the South Sudan
Anticorruption Commission (SSACC) and the South Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC).



                                             6
This activity component was also a substantial expansion of Project resources accounting
for an additional 27.5 percent of the original (US$20 million) grant amount.

New funding for existing activities

26.     In addition to the new components, in December 2006, the Government of Japan
agreed to fund the text book portion of the MOA. Thus the textbook component was
removed from the MOA which resulted in a cost saving of about $4.39 million. With the
newly available MDTF funds, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology
(MOE) was able to fund the purchase and distribution of texts for grades P1-P8,
originally to be funded under the Multi Donor Education Rehabilitation Project
(MDERP). The funding of the P1-P8 textbooks freed funds to support additional schools
to be built under the MDERP. The cold storage room, now being used by the Central
Medical Stores, was also financed by another donor (UNICEF-funds from Japan), which
freed up US$3.5 million of Project resources. These resources were retained by the
project for eligible expenses. One use of the funds was to procure additional
pharmaceuticals and to pay for increased budget for procurement services.

1.7 Other significant changes

27.     Restructurings. There were two restructurings: 1. June 20, 2011 and 2. June 25,
2012. The 2011 restructuring was level one and included a revision of the PDO and the
results framework, as well as an extension of the closing date from June 30, 2011 to June
30, 2012. The 2012 restructuring was only to extend the closing date from June 30, 2012
to December 31, 2012. Though the Project was formally restructured only twice, the
closing date had been extended twice before and the MOA amended six other times. The
four closing date extensions amounted to a total of four years and six months.

28.     MDTF funding of counterpart funds. When the GoSS experienced severe
public revenue shortages because of reduced oil revenues in 2009, the Bank made a
portfolio wide decision to fund 100 percent of project costs. This decision affected only
Support to Commissions as it was the only component of RIEP that was still open. The
Bank ended up funding US$7.5 million for Support to Commissions.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

29.     Preparation took place under the most challenging conditions. There was only
minimal infrastructure in the country as it had suffered for nearly 40 of the previous 50
years in a state of civil war. When Bank staff were first deployed to Juba, their living
quarters and offices were tents. After six months staff were able to move their offices
into shipping containers.

30.     The Project was the first project to be financed from the MDTF which was the
main vehicle for donor funding after the CPA. Use of this vehicle represents application
of the lesson learned that coordination of donor funding is essential for achieving
development outcomes in a fragile state. The MDTF was designed to provide a blend of
short-term assistance (urgently needed health and education supplies, urgently needed
offices in order for the central and state governments to function), and longer term
development assistance (capacity building in financial management-FM, and
procurement). Characteristic of first-in-the-country Bank projects in past years (such as
in the Former Soviet Union countries), the Project contained a number of disparate
elements from procurement and accounting services to pharmaceutical and education
supplies, from construction of government buildings to community-level projects. The


                                               8
preparation of this wide range of activities placed the MDTF in a position to prepare
more focused projects, which is what happened in a number of areas (health, education
and fiduciary).

Governance Structure for MDTF and RIEP

31.     The Bank’s role as the MDTF administrator was approved by the Bank’s
Executive Directors, but the RIEP was approved by the OC and not that Bank’s Board.
Thus, the MDTF functioned outside of normal Bank procedures and was not required to
follow the emergency guidelines of OP8.5 which was in effect at the time of appraisal.
The Oversight Committee (OC) approved all projects funded from the MDTF. The OC
was supported by a Technical Secretariat (TS), also administered by the Bank, which
would receive review proposals and make recommendations to the OC regarding
allocation of resources. The OC was responsible for all programmatic and allocational
decisions for the MDTF. The OC provided overall strategic guidance and inter-
ministerial and donor coordination and was co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and the
Joint Donor Team (representing the EU, Germany and other donors). The OC also had
representatives of the TS, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNOCHA), and representatives of all concerned implementing ministries/agencies. The
OC approved the work plan and budgets for the Technical Secretariat, and reviewed audit
reports and quarterly progress reports. Any approvals that were required from the Bank
side were handled at the Country Director level or at a lower level.

32.     For the RIEP, the MOF was the implementing agency and its Directorate of
Planning (DOP)—Policy and Planning Unit was officially in charge of day-to-day
implementation. The Project design envisioned that the Bank TTL would be intensively
involved in assisting the DOP, its main counterpart. Initially, the Bank itself did not have
the benefit of an ongoing lending program, nor even a basic working environment.
Government counterparts worked under a minimal institutional framework. The Bank
relied on U.N. agencies (mainly the United Nations Office for Project Services-UNOPS
and UNICEF), which had been active during the civil war, and private firms to
implement most of the specific project activities.

Risks Identified at Preparation

33.      The FPP identified a number of risks:

      1. Delay in the Implementation of the Peace Process
      2. Resurgence of civil unrest
      3. Longer lead time required for establishing GoSS functionality and the new
         Ministries.
      4. Delay in approving 2005 and 2006 budgets for GoSS which may reduce the
         amount of counterpart funding available.
      5. Lack of experience in program implementation.
      6. Poor infrastructure – roads, transport, communication, etc




                                             9
   7. Movement of the Government to Juba and attendant diversion of managerial
      resources
   8. Difficulties in identifying qualified external technical assistance.

34.     The FPP listed project risks, and while it did not present a cohesive risk
mitigation plan, the project design dealt implicitly with a number of the cited risks. One
design feature was to have detailed FM and procurement arrangements backed up by
experienced consultants that would mitigate the risk of lack of experience in program
implementation. The planned use of U.N. agencies also aimed to mitigate risks related to
low capacity as well as the risk of longer lead time in establishing government
functionality. Each component of the Project had an implementing partner:

      Medical supplies—UNICEF and WFP (distribution only)
      School kits/Learning materials—UNICEF (distribution and supply)
      Procurement—Crown Agents
      Project Accounting—KPMG
      Support to 10 States—UNOPS
      GOSS Offices—UNOPS
      Community Public Works—UNDP (administered), UNOPS (implemented)
      Support to Commissions/Independent Agencies—Private contractors

35.     The use of U.N. agencies also helped mitigate the impediment of poor road
infrastructure, because these agencies had experience in working in South Sudan,
including the delivery of supplies and construction of facilities. While there was not an
explicit mitigation strategy for the lack of security, the MDTF could finance law
enforcement because it was not bound by Bank financing exclusions. Thus, the MDTF
was able to finance the Support to Police and Prisons Projects I & II, which was
implemented by UNDP as part of the UNDP’s Rule of Law Program.

36.    Role of Other Partners: The Project collaborated with other donors including
USAID, United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), UNICEF, WHO, and UNDP who
did not provide their assistance through the MDTF, but who supported the project, in-
kind or through parallel financing. GoSS funding supported complementary investments
such as the upgrading of the power generators needed to power the Central
Pharmaceutical Warehouse. The Project supported UNICEF’s textbook and WHO’s and
UNICEF’s measles vaccination and pharmaceutical supply and distribution programs.

2.2 Implementation

Construction and Delivery of Goods from the Project

37.     The Bank and MDTF donors recognized the “need for speed? in Project
implementation.      In December 2005, UNICEF and GoSS proceeded with the
procurement and distribution of student and teacher kits, textbooks and assist the MOH in
the distribution of medical kits. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) included a
retroactive clause to facilitate payment to cover UNICEF's costs. There was a delay in


                                           10
agreeing on reporting, FM and fraud and corruption terms and conditions of the (MOA)
between UNICEF and GoSS, the MOA was signed on December 7, 2006. As a result of
the retroactive clause the school kits and textbooks could be purchased and delivered
relatively quickly and were completed during 2006-07. The estimated value of the MOA
for school Kits and textbooks was US$ 6.7 million.

38.      U.N. Agencies (UNOPS and UNICEF) were also contracted to implement project
activities. UNICEF distributed learning materials and pharmaceuticals, while UNOPS
procured and distributed office and communication equipment to GoSS and Governors’
offices in the 10 states. UNOPS was contracted to implement all aspects of the
renovation of the governor’s offices from the design through contract administration.
UNOPS also implemented the UNDP-administered Public Works component, and
designed the pre-fab units for the Support to Commissions component. However, GoSS
later decided to construct the SSACC and SSAC as permanent structures, for which
private contractors were used. The Ministry of Finance was responsible for preparation,
evaluation, and awarding the contract for the Procurement Agent.

39.     Furnish and Equip GoSS Offices. The Project fully furnished the 18 ministries
that had been rehabilitated under the Sudan Emergency Transport and Infrastructure
Development Project (SETIDP). The reason that the other four targeted ministries were
not furnished was because SETIDP had not rehabilitated them. There is no data on the
actual number of Director and Deputy Director level officials reached, though there were
specific targets in the FPP.

40.     Delays in disbursements for construction and goods. There was a trade-off
between quick disbursement and due diligence which was difficult in a fragile, post-
conflict state. Even with heavy implementation support from the Bank team, consultants
and U.N. Agencies, providing basic fiduciary assurance and value for money was a slow
process. Despite efforts to disburse Project funds quickly for construction and goods,
outputs were sometimes delayed. Donors and the GoSS expressed the view that the
Bank’s administration was often too conservative given the emergency needs of the
country. This issue is addressed in detail in the forthcoming evaluation of the MDTF.

Performance of Capacity Building Inputs from the Project

41.    Procurement. Under the procurement component, the Procurement Policy Unit
(PPU) was established. The PPU expanded to a total of 16 staff, and was supported by
two TAs funded under the MDTF-SS Core Fiduciary and the by Inter Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD). USAID supported the PPU in drafting the initial
Procurement Bill. Procurement regulations and policy reviews were not done under the
Project as originally planned. GoSS’s current procurement regulations were prepared
through Bank-funded technical assistance under the LICUS Fund. The procurement
consultant, Crown Agents, did prepare draft sample tender documents and a procurement
manual. However, none of these documents were finalized or disseminated, so
implementation was only partial. Frannan International supported procurement activities
beginning in September 2010 after Crown Agents left in December 2009.



                                          11
42.     Financial Management, Monitoring and Disbursement. A project accounting
firm (KPMG) was recruited through sole source contracting as an interim arrangement,
effective December 2005, to provide accounting services to the PPU. In addition, a
monitoring agent, Price Waterhouse Coopers, was selected by the MDTF to assist the
Technical Committee in monitoring and reporting on the fiduciary aspects of this Project
and others financed by the MDTF. A Project Disbursement Unit was set up and staffed
by consultants hired by KPMG. The firm carried out accounting activities from March
2006 to June 2008, well beyond the planned period of 12 months, largely because the
process of hiring the long term Project Accounting Agent took much longer than
expected. From July to December 2008, KPMG continued to provide accounting
services under another MDTF-SS project, the Core Fiduciary Services Support Project.
The Government set up a Project Financial Management Unit (PFMU) within the MOF,
staffed by international and local consultants, to take over the accounting function from
KPMG beginning in January 2009 until the present. The services provided by PFMU
were rated satisfactory.

43.     Support to Commissions. This component was added to the Project through
amendment to the MOA on March 22, 2007, and was the reason for the extension of the
Project from March 31, 2009 until December 31, 2012. There were a number of factors
in the implementation delays (Table 4), including, in particular, the GoSS’s change in
preference from pre-fab to permanent structures, lengthy periods for consultant selection
and tendering for construction contractors, and dispute over site selection (for SSAC).

         Recruitment of a firm to design, tender and supervise construction work effective
         (October). Designs produced under the direction of the Ministry of Gender (which was
         also constructing a new building for its ministry).

2011     Bids for the construction of buildings opened (May). Contractors mobilized,
         excavation begins (November). Site for SSAC changed, work stopped.

2012     Construction begins for SSAC after new site found in April, 2012.
2013     Construction continues for both buildings. Completion expected for SSACC before
         July 2013, for SSAC before December 31, 2013.
Annex 10 provides a general timeline of key events related to the RIEP.




                                             12
44.     Lack of evidence of title to the land where the offices were to be constructed
caused delays in construction work and the project was extended from March 30, 2010 to
June 30, 2011 in order to facilitate completion of the construction of the two
commissions buildings. Despite the extensions of the Project, construction of the SSAC
and SSACC could not be completed during the project life because of additional factors
including: (i) Delays in issuance of tax exemptions by Government; (ii) Poor planning
for procurement and delivery of construction materials by contractors; and (iii) Cashflow
challenges for contractors – whereas the client released payments to contractors on time,
there were instances where the contractor for the Audit Chamber building delayed
payment of workers’ salaries resulting in work slowdowns. At the time of the ICR field
mission, about 70 percent of the SSACC and 25 percent of the SSAC had been completed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

45.     Design. The Project did not have a formal results framework. However, there
were several results indicators that were monitored, revised and expanded at
restructuring, and evaluated. The Implementing Agencies (IAs) prepared periodic
Financial Management (FM) Reports which tracked outputs and milestones. Monitoring
focused on confirmed delivery of learning materials and pharmaceuticals, completion of
renovation of government offices and delivery of office equipment. Key outcome
indicators that were identified in the FPP could not be or were not monitored during the
project, including:

   •   Student-textbook ratio,
   •   Adequate supply of pharmaceuticals
   •   Staff/computer connectivity ratio
   •   Percentage of health facilities with stock-out of sentinel drugs (antibiotics, anti-
       malarials, vaccines) in the previous 30 days.

46.      Implementation and Utilization. Most key performance indicators were revised
as shown in Table 1. While the revised indicators provided a better match for the project
activities and PDOs and were more measureable and attributable to the Project, they still
captured only outputs, rather than outcomes and, therefore, did not adequately capture the
achievement of the PDOs. In addition, the PDOs and indicators were revised after all of
the activities except Support to Commissions were completed (88.6 percent of
disbursements). As a result, it has been necessary for the ICR to supplement the evidence
for achievement of objectives in section 3.2.

47.     Monitoring was important to confirmation of delivery of pharmaceuticals and
learning materials. It also confirmed the need for follow-up projects in these areas
(health and education) and in fiduciary support, which were later implemented. M&E
reporting on public works was carried out separately by UNDP, which was useful to
overall evaluation of the Project. There were some inconsistencies in estimating the
number of beneficiaries because learning kits alone were estimated to benefit 850,000
persons, while the total direct beneficiaries was recorded at 1,000,000. The ICR mission
revealed that pharmaceutical beneficiaries, alone, were independently estimated at 2.5
million persons. There were an additional 650,000 beneficiaries from the Public Works


                                             13
component who are not included in this total which reaches approximately 4 million
people.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48.     As a project prepared under emergency conditions through the MDTF-SS, the ex
ante safeguard requirements were appropriately streamlined. The activities of the Project
that generated environmental impacts included: supply and disposal of pharmaceuticals
and medical consumables, small public works and support to infrastructure of 10 States
(renovation of office buildings). The potential impacts in all cases were minor, localized
and readily assessed, mitigated and managed. The inclusion of construction work as part
of restructuring in November 2009 triggered a modification of the Integrated Safeguards
Data Sheet (ISDS). Therefore, the ISDS was updated in March 2010; and the
environmental rating of the component stated as B- partial assessment. This rating
remained valid until the end of the Project.

49.     The purchase of medical supplies and their disposal were in accordance with
WHO guidelines and monitored by WHO specialists to the extent possible given travel
challenges in rural areas. Medical waste disposal monitoring was also supported by a
comprehensive program for medical waste disposal under the Bank-funded health care
project (effective July 28, 2006). Handling of any significant wastes during building
renovation required appropriate disposal of waste materials and the protection of the
workforce in the event of asbestos removal or that of other toxic materials. It could not
be determined whether a protocol to address possible asbestos removal was applied
during implementation as was planned in the FPP. However, it was confirmed that a
Bank environmental safeguards experts conducted regular site visits to the rehabilitated
and the new buildings under construction and that there was overall safeguard
compliance.

50.    With respect to the UNDP-administered public works component, the MOA
between UNDP and GoSS allowed UNDP to apply its own safeguard and fiduciary rules.
This decision was part of the flexibility to support smooth implementation in fragile and
post-conflict countries.

51.    There were no significant FM or procurement issues. Compliance by the
accounting and procurement agents was consistent and satisfactory. The monitoring
agent, Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC) was engaged by the World Bank to provide
independent fiduciary monitoring reporting for the Technical Secretariat to the OC and
performed satisfactorily.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

52.    Components 1 and 2, which closed on March 31, 2009, received concurrent and
follow up support from the MDTF/Bank education and health projects from 2006 onward.
Additionally, the Project-related activities received follow up support from the South
Sudan Transition Trust Fund (SSTTF) which was approved on June 20, 2011. This fund



                                           14
provided US$75 million in the areas of health, rural roads and private sector development.
The SSTTF-supported activities are now in early stages of implementation. The Support
to Commissions component whose buildings could not be completed by project close are
being completed through an allocation by GoSS, as confirmed during the ICR field
mission through interviews and site visits.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Objectives—Modest

53.     The objectives of the RIEP, both original and revised, were mostly relevant to
current Bank and national priorities as described in the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
FY 2013-2014 for the Republic of South Sudan (February 2013). However, the PDO as
stated in the original FPP (“restore livelihoods…? and “jumpstart the recovery?) implied
a scope beyond the reach of the Project and beyond what was measurable given the data
collection capacity in South Sudan. The objectives might also have taken greater account
of the need to address the post-conflict environment, as pointed out in the ISN. For
example, the Project was an opportunity to address the demobilization of ex-combatants
and improving access to justice and dispute resolution systems, which was a prerequisite
for building governing capacity. The PDO became more focused and relevant after the
revision in the 2011 restructuring, but almost 90 percent of the Project had been
implemented by that time.

Design—Substantial

54.     The design of the project was relevant to current national priorities. South Sudan
continues to rely on supplies of pharmaceuticals and learning materials from external
sources. Government capacity in the area of procurement and FM has improved, but
continues to need strengthening. Substantial relevance of design is supported by the fact
that RIEP activities gave rise to at least three standalone, MDTF-financed projects, a
health, an education and a core fiduciary project.

55.     The eight adjustments to design through MOA amendments ensured that the
Project maintained its relevance to country needs. Adding components such as the Public
Works component extended the reach and impact of the Project. However, it was not
possible to prove the project design’s relevance through completed value chains, because
outcomes were not measured and, therefore, it was not possible to establish a full value
chain for the Project’s main outputs. In order to compensate for this information gap, the
ICR mission interviewed local authorities and determined, at a minimum, that
beneficiaries had received the outputs from public works, learning materials and
pharmaceuticals.

56.   The RIEP addressed a number of priorities that are expressed in the South Sudan
Development Plan (SSDP) 2011-2013. For example, the SSDP’s governance pillar



                                           15
addresses the capacity of oversight institutions (SSAC and SSACC buildings) to increase
accountability, transparency and the broad participation of diverse groups in government
to which the building of the two commissions contributes. It could be argued that if the
two commission buildings had been built as pre-fab structures as originally designed,
scarce resources would have been saved and the buildings could have been completed on
time. At the same time, the GoSS made a strong argument, which was supported by one
of its governance champions that having a permanent facility with greater capacity would
have a powerful demonstration effect that the Government was committed to improved
governance. The pillar on social and human development calls for rapidly expanding
quality health services throughout the country, and increasing school enrollment
(especially for girls), which the RIEP promoted through provision of basic medical and
school supplies. RIEP design might have been more relevant had it reflected that security
is a basic prerequisite for development.

Implementation—Substantial

57.    The Project sustained its relevance through eight amendments to the MOA,
including two, although late, restructurings. Using the flexibility of the MDTF, the RIEP
could take on additional activities including the UNDP administered Public Works
component (which had approximately 650,000 additional beneficiaries) and the
construction of two permanent commissions’ buildings (SSAC and SSACC). During
implementation the Project could also realize savings when additional donor resources
became available such as the cases of the Government of Japan purchase of textbooks
and UNICEF’s funding of the cold storage room that had originally been planned under
RIEP. Although the Project was extended for an inordinately long period, the addition of
two important structures contributing to governance is evidence of continued relevance of
the Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Substantial

58.      The original PDO was operational until well all but one of the project components
were completed. The components of pharmaceutical supplies and learning materials, the
procurement and FM support and the support to the ten states had already closed before
the first restructuring in June 2011. Therefore, although the revised PDOs were a better
reflection of the Project activities, they can be applied only to one active component, the
Support to Commissions, which was added to component 6 (Furnish and equip GoSS
offices). The ICR assesses the achievement of the original PDO for about 89 percent of
the Project, according to disbursements, and the remainder for the revised PDO. The
revised PDO applies only to the Support to Commissions component because it was the
only active component: “1. Put in place critical government infrastructure at national and
state level.? While the Project results framework was not adequate to assess the PDOs,
there is ample additional evidence of achievement compiled during the ICR stage.




                                            16
   1. To restore livelihoods resulting from the long term civil unrest—
      Substantially achieved

59.     Overall, it is clear that the Project outputs removed constraints to the restoration
of livelihoods. The indicators used by the Project to measure the achievement of this
objective were met and include “the number of students who benefited from improved
learning materials (850,000 actual vs. 850,000 target—UNICEF),? “months of
pharmaceuticals supplies available in South Sudan health service institutions (24 months
actual vs. 24 months target),? “the number of Direct Project Beneficiaries? (1,000,000
actual vs. 1,000,000 target), and “the number of female beneficiaries? (450,000 actual vs.
450,000 target). Note that targets match actuals exactly because the targets were
established ex post, i.e., after they were achieved.

60.      The ICR field mission received an additional estimate of Project benefits from
distribution of pharmaceuticals. Based on the fact that the Project supplied 1,000 health
facilities (hospitals, clinics, etc.), the Ministry of Health estimated that it was possible to
accommodate an additional 2.5 million health center visits and provide basic medical
supplies , including anti-malarials, antibiotics, bandages, etc. In the early years after the
CPA, there were few other sources of educational and medical supplies, and so the
Project represented a substantial share of the overall national supply.

61      The causal link between these activities and livelihoods is that the provision of
pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies would keep the beneficiaries healthier and
that they would be more productive as a result. By providing educational materials,
beneficiaries would also be more productive because they would be more educated.
While these are plausible links, there are no data on the health benefits of the medical
supplies, or on literacy or enrollment or any other education outcomes, because of the
severe lack of data collection capacity.

62.     Early Bank supervision also missions made these causal links, stating that the
“restoration of livelihoods? were being achieved through, for example, the distribution of
textbooks, student and teacher kits for grades P1-P4. The Project supported the
UNICEF's Back to School Program which enabled primary school children to return to
school, which, in the long run, would improve the livelihoods of the communities through
education.

63.      Because of the elapsed time since the supplies from components 1
(pharmaceuticals) and 2 (learning materials), it was also not possible to identify direct
beneficiaries at the ICR stage. The ICR team reviewed logbooks of pharmaceutical
deliveries for health centers at State and County levels. Data was not kept for the number
of persons served, but examination of the log books confirmed that stock outs did occur,
followed by several replenishments indicating that people were frequenting the health
facilities on a level that surpassed project supplies provided by the Project. With the
transportation network in extremely poor condition, the delivery of these supplies was a
major achievement in itself.




                                              17
64.     There is additional evidence that livelihoods were restored that was not produced
for, or used in the Project M&E framework. In particular, the “Public Works Programme
Component of the RIEP—Final Report,? March 31, 2009, provides considerable
additional information on achievement of the PDOs. The report states that a total of
654,469 people benefited directly from the public works component. These beneficiaries
are in addition to the beneficiary totals quoted above that were reported in the ISRs. The
construction of small roads, markets, hospitals, schools, boreholes and sanitation facilities
has resulted in increased access to services. Though outcome data is not available, the
report identifies the following benefits of this new infrastructure:

   •   Increased attendance and enrollment in schools, partly because of new boreholes,
       which means that girls no longer go to fetch water from afar and because of the
       rehabilitation and construction of schools within the towns in the various states. In
       Kuajok state for example the new primary school has about 2,000 pupils.
   •   Control of damaging floods during the rainy season and the resulting reduction of
       water borne diseases.
   •   Curbing of disease prevalence due to improved sanitation and environmental
       public health through building of latrines and town clean up campaigns.
   •   Improved health services resulting from the new health centers/hospitals and
       clinics, with reduced congestion at the old facilities.

65.     The public works component also aimed at providing short-term employment
which was consistent with restoring livelihoods. The final report on the component
stated that 195,003 person days of work were generated by the small public works
projects across the country. Female labor accounted for 75,364 days of this total.

   2. To restore basic services to the affected population—Achieved

66.      The indicators used to measure the achievement of this objective were essentially
the same as for PDO 1: (i) Students that benefited from improved learning materials
(numbers); and (ii) Pharmaceuticals supplies available in South Sudan health service
institutions (months). Basic services in both education and health were restored initially
through the supply and delivery of the much needed medical kits to the PHU, PHCC and
hospitals throughout South Sudan. Medical supplies, not otherwise available, were
provided to prevent and treat malaria and other common illnesses. As stated under PDO
1, all targets were met. The public works component also contributed substantially to
both restoring and improving access to basic services.

   3. To jump start the recovery process in Southern Sudan through the
      emergency provision of goods and services to improve government
      functionality—Partially achieved




                                             18
Revised PDO—Put in place critical government infrastructure at national and state
level—Partially achieved.2

67.    This part of the original PDO is somewhat complicated to evaluate because it is a
chain of effects with jumpstarting the recovery as the main goal. This goal was to be
achieved through improved government functionality, which, in turn was to be achieved
through the emergency provision of goods and services. To assess its achievement takes
some untangling and a few assumptions.

68.     The evidence of the emergency provision of goods and services and improved
government functionality is easier to verify and was achieved. “Recovery? is a general
term, and, without appropriate indicators to measure it, it can be evidenced by almost any
indication of improvement in the country. The original PDO is somewhat more specific
than that because it refers to recovery that is specifically attributable to improved
government functionality. The ICR also interprets that the delivery of services means
rehabilitation of offices and supply of equipment as well as capacity building for
procurement and accounting, because these were the main activities of the Project to
improve government functionality.

69.     Establishing the causal link between government functionality and providing
offices and equipment is basically the same as explaining why a government official
needs an office to function, because in many instances, officials had neither offices nor
equipment. Prior to the Project, officials had to meet in ad hoc ways, at homes, lodging
establishments (it would not be correct to state proper hotels, as there were none), and
weather permitting, under the shade of trees. Governors and Ministers often did not
know where their staffs were, or how to contact them. What the Project did for
government functionality was to provide a fixed place where officials could operate and
communicate. The ICR recognizes this achievement as a prerequisite for recovery.

70.     In a general sense, there was economic recovery with GDP growth recorded at 4.3
and 4.2 percent in 2009 (the first year of GDP records) and 2010, respectively, before
dropping to 1.9 percent in 2011. The ICR does not contend that this growth is fully
attributable to the Project, but is making the point that there was significant positive
growth, which is consistent with a recovery.

71.    The indicators used to measure the achievement of this objective were:
Functioning state offices equipped and linked to the ministries (10 actual, 10 target).
Ministries rehabilitated and/or equipped (including the presidency and vice presidency—
18 actual, 22-target). 3 Contributing this PDO were the following components:
Procurement Services, Project Accounting Services, Support for the 10 States, furnish


2
 Again, this PDO was revised after or 88.6 percent (US$32.1 million including the Public Works
Component) of the Project had been disbursed.
3
    As stated, four of the ministries were not furnished because they had not been rehabilitated.



                                                  19
and equip Goss Offices, Support to Commissions (SSAC and SSACC buildings partially
completed).

72.    Functionality of GoSS and the Governors' offices of the 10 states Government
was also improved through the hiring of an accounting agent to perform the treasury
functions for the Ministry of Finance and through the provision of communications
equipment (V-sat and telephone system), furniture, vehicles and generators. This
equipment allowed state governments to be connected to both higher and lower levels of
government, including communication with the central government in Juba and mobility
of government officials to provide services to the public.

73.     The restructured PDO is a better fit to project activities and more specific and
monitorable. However, it can only be applied to a portion of the Support to Commissions
component. The buildings that this component was supposed to complete were only
partially completed (70 percent for SSACC and 25 percent for SSAC). However,
because the construction of the buildings is ongoing and steady, as confirmed during the
ICR field mission, the restructured objective can be said to be partially achieved.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

74      The FPP did not contain an economic analysis for this Project citing OP 8.5.4
Overall the Project spent US$ 36.26 million of MDTF resources to reach an estimated 3-
4 million beneficiaries with pharmaceuticals, learning materials and small public works.
Per beneficiary expenditure is US$9.06-US$12.09. The Project made a monetarily
modest per capita investment that brought significant benefits to a substantial percentage
(nearly one-half) of the population.

75.    The Project was efficient in leveraging funds. It had prepared components
including textbooks and a cold storage room for medicines, which later attracted
financing from other donors. In the Public Works component, efficiency was achieved
by allowing the sub-projects to be determined by local authorities (steering committees).
The steering committees were given a designated amount (US$1.0 million per state) and
generated their own community projects. The communities were assisted by UNOPS in
contracting and executing the works. The Project also gave rise to at least three
additional MDTF-financed projects.

76.    By using UNOPS the Project was able to achieve efficiencies because UNOPS
was already established in South Sudan and was implementing other projects in the States.
They were able to reach all the states relatively quickly with Project outputs given the
transportation challenges of the country. UNOPS knew local contractors, and, therefore,
were in a position to select reliable ones to implement the activities. Using their

    Nowhere else did the FPP cite OP 8.5, nor did the Board Paper for the MDTF cite OP8.5.



                                                     20
procurement offices in the United Arab Emirates (Dubai) UNOPS was able to procure
and deliver vehicles, motorcycles, VSATs, generators, computers and other equipment to
South Sudan.

77.     The reason the efficiency rating is “substantial? rather than “high? is the
protracted delay in building the SSAC and SSACC, which required several extensions of
the closing date. Much of the construction remained to be done after Project close. The
GoSS was left with the responsibility for funding the remaining cost of construction at a
time when it had a severe shortage of funds. That said, the permanent structures that the
GoSS preferred did exceed the Project budget. The Government was able to contribute
the necessary funds for the buildings prior to “no objection? and signing of contracts.
The efficiency rating might have been further downgraded to “modest,? but the closing
date extensions were mainly to accommodate only a relatively small part of the overall
Project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.     The overall outcome rating reflects significant achievements in a context of
almost unparalleled challenge that was complicated by a poorly formulated PDO. Table
5 shows the disbursement-weighted rating for the Project. With the relevance of
objectives rated modest, design and implementation rated substantial, and achievement of
PDO and efficiency also rated as substantial, the overall outcome rating is moderately
satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

79.     The Project reached rural areas which were severely undersupplied with
medicines and educational materials and virtually no infrastructure or easily accessible
water. Thus, the vast majority of beneficiaries were poor. Positive gender impacts were
achieved through employment of women in public works, reduced time for carrying
water and supply of pharmaceutical and learning materials. Because females lag behind
males in enrollment, as reported by UNICEF, the Project ensured that females would also
benefit in large number from the Project’s outputs. Gender promotion was reflected in an



                                              21
indicator in the restructured results framework, but it was not a part of either the original
or revised PDO.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

80.     Institutional strengthening was a major output of the Project, but it occurred
mainly through the provision of physical assets. The GoSS capacity in procurement and
financial management improved but did not meet expectations under RIEP. However,
capacity building in these areas was supported by the Core Fiduciary Project (approved
after RIEP). In governance, the new SSACC and SSAC buildings are sending a signal
that the GoSS is committed to an improved audit function and addressing cases of
corruption.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

81.    The MDTF proved to be a broad and flexible mechanism that helped the Project
respond to new opportunities and needs as the Project progressed. For example, the
UNDP added a large component to support the PDO through small public works
throughout the country. A negative outcome was that the GoSS too often took on a
spectator role and could have taken fuller advantage of the opportunity to learn quickly
from the donor and consultant expertise that was continually operating in the country.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not Applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

82.      As a project designed to bring urgently needed services and inputs, RIEP was
aimed more at preventing short-run decline than achieving sustainable, long-run
development. Still, with the ICR being prepared four years after all but one of
components had been completed, the ICR can take a longer-term look at the durability of
its achievements than is typical for ICRs. It also means a harsher test because more than
just a plausible case for sustainability has to be made; actual evidence of sustainability
may be observable. In the case of RIEP, the Bank, through the MDTF, followed up in
key areas with specific projects so that education and pharmaceutical supplies and
support to fiduciary functions would not be interrupted for at least several years after the
initial deliveries under RIEP.

83.     For the intermediate term, GoSS counterpart funds are unlikely until the flow of
oil resumes because oil exports are the source of almost all of the GoSS revenue.
Counterpart funds were waived originally because of the fiscal crisis, but the drop in oil
revenues means that this waiver will need to continue. This loss of revenue could also be
an opportunity for the country. While South Sudan may earn only a fraction of its
potential oil revenue, it can focus on, for example, its vast and underdeveloped
agriculture sector, which is in dire need of modern inputs and techniques. It is important


                                             22
for sustainability of Project outputs that South Sudan takes more active control over
development processes (see Section 3.5 c.).

84.     Overall, there is a palpable sense of South Sudan moving forward with indications
of enhanced livelihoods. Gas stations, traffic and shops that did not exist in the early
years of RIEP are now part of the scene. One of the main constraints to development,
poor roads, is being gradually addressed with investments to build sections of roads
connecting the larger towns in the pipeline. These are not occurrences attributable to the
Project per se, but the Project promised to restore livelihoods and basic services and that
is the direction in which things are currently moving years after closure of most of the
Project. There is a strong donor commitment and it is unlikely that South Sudan will
dissolve into the post-civil war condition and the rudimentary functioning of the
government and the economy that existed at the beginning of RIEP.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.    For pure dedication and ability of Bank field staff to overcome uncommon
adversity of living and working conditions and other implementation challenges, the
Bank team would deserve a performance rating of highly satisfactory. Initially living and
working in tents without air conditioning in 100+F. degree heat with minimal office
equipment and graduating to shipping containers only after six months in the country, the
Bank field staff helped design a project that brought relatively fast benefits to millions of
South Sudanese and helped the GoSS to begin to function in a secure environment with
basic office technology. The Bank team also worked with the GoSS to design a Project
with wide-ranging activities which were relevant to the many acute needs in the country.

86.     Despite this dedication there were some significant shortcomings.           The
articulation of the PDO was far too general and somewhat convoluted in one part (i.e.,
basic services leading to improved government functionality leading to jumpstarting the
economy), which made attribution of achievement of the PDO to Project activities
difficult. The results framework was particularly weak, and, therefore, did not mitigate
the poorly worded PDO, but further complicated the assessment of achievement of the
Project objectives, which had to be remedied at the ICR stage.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.    This rating represents a mixed performance, with a high level of dedication
throughout the Project from the Bank team, but a dedication that was foiled at times by
delayed adjustment to the implementation realities in South Sudan in the years after it


                                             23
became a semi-autonomous region in Sudan. One strength in supervision was that the
Project was managed mainly from Juba, which allowed continuous support to the GoSS
on ‘nitty gritty’ implementation issues. For example, in the case of the SSAC and
SSACC buildings, the Bank team spent a substantial amount of time following up on tax
exemptions, design and construction issues with the supervising engineer covering even
details such as tile selection, which proved time-consuming to resolve.

88.     Another strength in supervision was the ability to work with UN agencies to
deliver project outputs under extremely challenging transport conditions. There was no
significant spoilage of medicines or issue of non-delivery of education materials reported
under RIEP. The Bank accommodated the public works component which yielded 142
subprojects. While these subprojects were not individually assessed, the ICR mission did
confirm that most of the small public works visited were successful. 5 The Bank also
made a portfolio wide decision to cover counterpart funds when GoSS faced a fiscal
crisis in 2009 to ensure continued implementation of the Project(s). Strength was the
detailed Aide-memoires and regular supervision visits by the Project team.

89.     One of the moderate shortcomings in supervision was the decision to keep
extending the Project with the hope of completing the Support to Commissions
component. In retrospect, it would have been preferable to find alternative financing for
the construction of the SSAC and the SSACC. If the MDTF were indeed a flexible
instrument that could accommodate changing needs and opportunities, why, then, was
extending the RIEP the only avenue to completing the Support to Commissions? Had
alternative funding been secured, the Project could have been closed in March 2009 when
all of the other Project financed activities had been completed. The Bank’s reputation
would also not have been jeopardized by numerous extensions and failure in the end to
complete the buildings. In fairness to the supervision team, the country context for
implementation contributed to continuous delays that accumulated to more than four
years that could not have been fully anticipated. More importantly, it would have been
worse for the Bank not to have followed through with the financing of the buildings (in
the absence of other financing) as that would have posed an even greater reputational risk.

90.      The Bank decision to put supervision of construction under the Ministry of
Gender simply because it was also overseeing the construction of its office building may
also ill-advised because this ministry had no in-house expertise in building construction.
The Bank did attempt to compensate for this lack of expertise by providing an
engineering consultant, but there were other factors as well in the delays (Section 2.2)

91.    Another cost of the multiple extensions was that there was greater difficulty for
the ICR in compensating for the weak results framework. Beneficiaries could not be
expected to recall receiving either the primary school learning materials or


5
  One exception was a slaughter house in Yei, which had design flaws which caused unsanitary conditions
and community resentment. However, other public works, including latrines, markets, schools and roads
that were visited were all providing the expected benefits to the communities.



                                                  24
pharmaceuticals from a specific project, the last of which had been supplied five years
before the ICR mission.

92.     The Bank remedied the poorly formulated PDO in the 2011 restructuring. It also
upgraded the results framework making it far more reflective of the Project activities and
used new indicators that could be measured, or at least credibly estimated. It would have
been better had the 2011 restructuring been done earlier, perhaps three or four years
earlier when the public works component was added (March 2007), and while the other
components were still active and the issue of pre-fab vs. permanent structures for the
SSAC and SSACC was being raised.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

93.      This rating is an exercise in weighing the high level of dedication in a challenging
context for implementation on the one hand with the imperfect navigation through the
realities of a country climbing out of 39 years of civil unrest on the other. With the
preparation rating of moderately satisfactory, a supervision rating of moderately
satisfactory and an outcome rating of moderately satisfactory, the overall rating is
moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

94.     The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) performed reasonably
well in providing the needed approvals. It also worked well on the Project Oversight
Committee and ensured timely approval of the many amendments to the MoA, and was
effective in chairing the project directors’ meetings focusing on implementation bottle
necks. Counterpart funds were reliably provided until the fiscal crisis in 2009. One area
where GoSS performance was weak was in confirming the site selection for the SSAC
building, which was changed after the building contractor had been deployed. The GoSS
could also have made better arrangements for staff to build knowledge and skills from
contacts with donors and consultants working in the country.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     This rating represents a mixed performance, again, with some of the regional
government entities performing almost heroically in getting supplies to beneficiaries, but
with the agencies often missing opportunities to build capacity by learning from
consultants funded by the Project. A bright spot in implementing agency performance
relates to the SSACC and SSAC buildings. Despite the many delays, which dragged on
beyond even the multiple extensions of the RIEP, government officials at each of these


                                             25
institutions demonstrated dedication to press on. These officials secured necessary
government funds, in a fiscally tight environment, to complete the buildings, both of
which are on schedule for completion in 2013.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.    With the government rating of moderately satisfactory and an implementing
agencies rating of moderately satisfactory, the overall rating is moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

97.    An MDTF is an effective financing vehicle to address changing circumstances
in a fragile/post conflict state. Despite disagreements between some donors and Bank
administration of the MDTF, the RIEP confirmed, for the most part, that a multi-donor
approach affords flexibility that is needed in a fluid environment. The MDTF
accommodated additional donor funds and was able to use freed funds for other
development priorities (expanding textbooks to P1-P8) and to add components to expand
the reach of the project (employment and small works for hundreds of thousands of
additional beneficiaries).

98.     Appropriate results frameworks and PDOs that match project activities are
feasible and necessary even in projects in fragile, post-conflict countries. In the case
of RIEP, the results framework was virtually non-existent and the few PDO indicators
that were identified were not and could not be monitored. The 2011 restructuring proved,
however, that it was possible to specify indicators that could be measured and used to
assess an appropriately worded PDO.

99.    There is a tendency for government counterparts, when flooded with donors
and donor support, to become complacent and defer to the donor community, which
may result in missed opportunities for capacity building. There are many high
potential South Sudanese who could benefit from mentoring from donor personnel and
consultants in the country. This would be a partial solution to ongoing capacity
weaknesses and to the lack of good quality professional development in South Sudan.

100. Political imperatives may trump best practices in ensuring project success .
Giving each donor their own role in the MDTF may improve participation and
therefore effectiveness, even if it may not maximize efficiency through a single,
harmonized governance structure. This is a lesson of the broader MDTF-SS, and it
refers to the fact that, while it might be preferable to have all donors on board and
harmonized through a MDTF, donors may still wish to contribute in a way that is
distinctly “theirs.? In other words, donors may feel the need to identify an
accomplishment for their constituents back home that clearly justifies the expenditure.
Complicating this tendency is that some of the donors viewed the MDTF as a “Bank?
fund in which these donors did not have sufficient input. The end result was that a



                                           26
number of important donors peeled off from the MDTF and pursued their own programs
and far less resources were provided to the MDTF-SS than were originally pledged.
(Note that at the time of this ICR a full evaluation of the activities of the MDTF is
underway and expected to be completed by the end of FY2013).

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Grantee/Implementing Agencies/Donors
(a) Grantee/Implementing agencies

Responses to GoSS ICR/Comments on the Bank ICR—GoSS Meeting, May 13, 2013

101. The GoSS review of the Bank ICR shows basic agreement on the implementation
and impact of the RIEP. There are also several areas of differing views that warrant a
follow-up response in the Bank ICR. While each of these individual comments may not
represent government consensus, they are useful and are addressed individually where
there may be a divergence of views.

102. The Bank recognizes that it would have been beneficial to have further study of
the capacity of remote facilities, but, a major theme of the ICR and the Project was that
faster delivery was right priority. If there were cases of some of the medical supplies sent
to areas where it was difficult to distribute onward, that was part of the trade-off. The
point is also made by one of the attendees to the GoSS review meeting that health center
staff in some instances did not know what to do with the drugs. However, these were the
most basic and essential drugs such as anti-malarials and antibiotics. Anyone working in
a health facilities would be aware of the use of these medicines.

103. The skepticism of the high estimate of health beneficiaries is well-taken. The
additional 2.5 million beneficiaries would better be described as 2.5 million health center
visits and the text of the Bank ICR has been so revised. It is essential to understand that
these visitors to the health centers would not have received basic treatments without
Project supplies. A comment was also made about inconsistencies in number of
beneficiaries from educational outputs, however, after review, no inconsistencies were
discovered.

104. The point that the UNICEF funds came from the Government of Japan has been
added.

105. The MOFEP pointed out that the Core Fiduciary Project was the project mainly
responsible for building FM and procurement capacity. The ICR agrees and states that
the RIEP gave rise to, among other projects, the Core Fiduciary Project. Another
comment from an MOFEP representative concerned the lack of consultation with the 10
states and the inability to measure satisfaction with Project outputs. However, the ICR
mission did visit two states (in Torit and Yei) and confirmed the repairs and upgrades to
state government facilities, including windows, roofs, V-Sat and office equipment.
Because these improvements had been implemented 6 to 7 years earlier, State
governments were already into the next generation of upgrades and equipment, including
the building of new offices in some cases.

106. There were also comments asking for documentation of the outputs of the UNDP
Public Works Component. In response, a copy of the UNDP final report on this
component was sent to GoSS, “Public Works Programme Component of the Rapid
Impact Emergency Project (PWPC-RIEP)—Final Evaluation,? Cliff Bernard Nuwakora

Note: The Project incurred only Trust Fund cost and no Bank Budget cost. The costs do not

Administration Code and not the RIEP-specific code. The ICR author conferred with the
Resource Management staff responsible, but it was not feasible to sort out the RIEP costs from
the Program Administration code. The same is true for Bank staff weeks.

    Consolidated Government Comments on the Rapid Impact
   Emergency Program (RIEP) Implementation and Completion
                           Report
Background:
The Rapid Impact Emergency Project (RIEP) has been one of the first projects under the
umbrella of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund. The Project was established in 2005 and
operated in a difficult environment that prevailed immediately after the signing of the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement. There were a number of acute needs to which the
RIEP attempted to respond. These requirements ranged from shortages of basic health
and education supplies, low capacity in procurement and financial management
functions, no adequate government facilities and high unemployment in the post-
conflict context. The project aimed at addressing these needs through the following 8
sub-components:

    1. Pharmaceuticals: Support the procurement and distribution of pharmaceuticals,
        vaccines, and medical consumables for hospitals, health centers, and health
        posts in Southern Sudan Provision of a cold room for the Juba Central
        Pharmaceutical Warehouse. The second item was eventually dropped from the
        project as it benefited from other source of funding from UNICEF. (Total Cost:
        USD 3.8 million).
    2. Learning Materials: Support the procurement and distribution of Arabic
        Language textbooks, teacher’s manuals, student kits and teacher’s kits for
        grades P1 – P4 (Total Cost: USD 3.8 million).


                                          37
    3. Procurement: Review and revise the procurement regulations, policies and
        procedures governing GoSS procurement activities. Carry out the day-to-day
        procurement activities of GoSS for a period of two years (Total Cost: USD 3.6
        million).
    4. Accounting: Support for an accountancy firm (KPMG) to work with the GoSS
        (MOFEP) to establish the Project Disbursement Unit for 6 – 12 months until the
        long term project accounting agent is hired. The purpose of this Unit was to
        prepare and issue the Project Implementation Guidelines and accounting for all
        project-related expenditures. The Unit was also responsible for providing
        fiduciary assurance to GoSS and MDTF regarding the use of funds during the
        period of the contract (Total Cost: USD 1.7 million).
    5. Support to the Ten States: Support for the establishment of the Governor’s
        office in each of the 10 States, through basic renovations and provision of office
        equipment, including computers and v-sat equipment for communication with
        the Central Government (Total Cost: USD 2.69 million)
    6. Furnish and Equip GOSS Offices: Supply a basic package of furniture and
        equipment (inc. computers, photocopiers, scanners, V-sat equipment,
        generators, vehicles) to enable approximately 90 Director level officials and 180
        Deputy Directors in 22 Ministries to become functional (Total Cost: USD 4.3
        million)
    7. Public Works: Support local communities in 10 states through a variety of small
        civil works projects (e.g., pit latrines, small roads, market shelters). Sub-projects
        to be determined by local authorities (steering committees), who were given a
        designated amount (US$1.0 million per state) and generated their own
        community projects (Total Cost: USD 8.76 million)
    8. Support to the Commissions: Fund the building of the South Sudan
        Anticorruption Commission (SSACC) and the South Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC).
        Full US$7.5 million budget was financed by the WB following the oil crisis of
        2009 (Total Cost: USD 7.61 million)
The overall total cost of financing provided under this project was USD 36.26 million.

Project Evaluation
After running for over 6 years the RIEP project has come to an end in the first months of
2013. The World Bank, as a manger of the MDTF, has procured an external evaluator to
undertake an evaluation of the project. An Evaluation Report was prepared and the
Government of South Sudan was invited to provide comments on the Evaluation Report.
A meeting of key Government stakeholder in the RIEP project took place on 13 th of May,
2013 where participants were invited to submit their comments on the project and the


                                             38
Evaluation Report (list of participants is provided in the Annex). In the next section the
abovementioned Consolidated Government Comments are provided.

Consolidated Government Comments
1. Pharmaceuticals
Ministry of Health (MOH)

       The issue of pharmaceuticals is very vital. This was a well thought out project but
        it also had some drawbacks. A lot of medicines were supplied, but it was based
        on limited research/needs assessment. As a result, drugs were sent to counties
        without the facilities and human resources necessary to store and distribute
        them. Too often, the project relied on community health workers who have little
        knowledge of the drugs and what to do with them.
     It was an example of a push systems rather then pull – and therefore was not as
        relevant as it could have been. Different health institutions have different needs,
        and this wasn’t reflected in the project.
     There was no proper supervision or monitoring to ensure that the medicines
        distributes are used properly or have the right impact. Supervision during
        implementation phase of the project is vital. This needs to be reflected in next
        pooled fund (SSPF) and RSS must be involved from the initial phase to identify
        the gaps that need to be filled in project design and implementation.
     This component of the project lacked a log-frame, hence if we don’t have this
        information, it is very difficult to know the extent of the project’s achievements.
     UNICEF funds for the construction of the cold-room storage for medicines came
        from government of Japan. This investment was very important and in line with
        our MOH’s priorities.
     It is however noted that a higher degree of local ownership would be
        appropriate for execution of this part of the project.
     Reduction in child mortality was possible in part to the vaccination campaign
        financed through this project.
Office of Economic Advisor to the President

      One of the key components of RIEP project was to supply of pharmaceuticals to
       clinics throughout South Sudan. The project evaluation notes that at a cost of
       US$ 3.8 million 1000 clinics were supplied with pharmaceuticals. Further the
       project states that “given the amount of pharmaceuticals consumed, including
       anti-malarials, antibiotics, etc., and other medical supplies, an estimated 2.5
       million persons benefited from the medical supplies provided by the Project?.



                                            39
      This shows that 2.5 million people benefited for free distribution of
      pharmaceuticals valued at USD 3.8 million implying that the cost of
      pharmaceuticals per beneficiary was only $US 1.52 per beneficiary including
      transport and administration costs. This seems as a rather low number. These
      figures may need to be revisited as the per beneficiary cost is rather low but also
      highlights that scale of challenge and investments necessary to provide adequate
      health services in South Sudan.
ACTION: MOH requested copies of the project’s logframe including results achieved.

2. Learning materials.
Ministry of General Education and Instruction (MOGEI):

      There are inconsistencies within the report regarding the number of
       beneficiaries reached that perhaps need to be verified/double checked.
    ICR is a useful resource for the government to discuss what educational
       programmes need to be implemented post-MDTF. This is of particular concern
       for the Ministry of Education as the RIEP project has closed. Education require
       significant investment from the side of Government and the Donor community.
ACTION: MOFEP to maintain close dialogue with health, education and water on
Partnership Fund Design.

3. Procurement
MOFEP

      Findings are correct. Crown Agents have left the project early. The project
       managers attempted to find another consultancy company to support this part
       of the RIEP project but bureaucratic procedures have taken a long time.
    Improving capacity in procurement can be attributed to the project only to a
       limited extend.
    Money to hire consultants in accounts and internal audit came later on in the
       Core Fiduciary Project.
    Core Fiduciary Project did encourage the Government to hire more procurement
       staff, however simply hiring more staff is not sufficient. This staff needs to also
       be appropriately trained in order to undertake work on a difficult, technical issue
       like procurement.
CHAIR (Mr. Aggrey Tisa Sabuni)

   It was at a certain stage in the project that GOSS decided that procurement
    procedures need a law rather than manuals, or at least for the law to supersede



                                           40
  manuals, so work has somewhat shifted to a different – USAID funded - project to
  draft the relevant laws.
MOFEP

      As mentioned above, after the end of RIEP involvement in procurement USAID
       and WB have undertaken an additional project that has supported GOSS
       finalized in the drafting of Procurement Law which is now with the Ministry of
       Justice for review.

4. Accounting
MOFEP

      Broadly, the findings of the report are correct.
      Two consultants helped us in final report for audit and trained our staff to
       prepare financial reports, and now we are doing it ourselves. However this
       capacity building came under core fiduciary rather than RIEP. Also under core
       fiduciary, we recruited more staff to the accounts department which helped our
       PFM capacity. By paving the way for that project, RIEP has helped better our
       situation but we need further improvements and support is required.
CHAIR (Mr. Aggrey Tisa Sabuni)

      It was a critical intervention. We were getting requests for money and releasing
       it. KPMG tried to keep our finances on track.

MOWRI

      During austerity measures we found ourselves doing better than when we had
       money. Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) undertook sound
       macroeconomic management and the exchange rate did not depreciate
       dramatically and has now gained some stability. Budget and planning systems
       are strengthening PFM.

5. Support to the 10 States
CHAIR (Mr. Aggey Tisa Sabuni):

      Previously, the Governors were based in regional capitals. This component was
       identified as a critical input to facilitate the 10 governors so they can
       communicate with the HQs in Juba. In Awiel, the security apparatus was
       reporting to Khartoum. We had a big rally where we told them the Governor is
       now your pay master. This project catered for the Governors and connected all
       the offices to Juba.


                                          41
Professor Ladu Lodu Bureng, Min. of Finance, CES:

       Equal division of component resources between states is not a reflection of
        differing levels of need.
    Project discussed and implemented without the presence of the states. This ICR
        should be sent to State Ministries of Finance. A general problem with MDTF
        projects was the lack of coordination with Local Government.
    Target indicator (number of states supported) provides no reflection on the
        satisfaction of beneficiaries. Cannot quantify the satisfaction without more
        details regarding the project.
    State Governments had little interaction with UNOPS.
    MDTF should have done a broad consultation on lessons learnt before it was
        extended.
    On balance, we were in an emergency situation, trying to survive as a people and
        as a Government, and MDTF did go some way in addressing these problems.
    Who did the consultant talk to in the States? This report should be sent to
        Council of Ministers of the States for their comments – they know the real
        benefits and lessons to be learnt.
ACTION: The consultant(s) are kindly requested to provide additional information as
specified above.

6. Furnish and equip GOSS offices
CHAIR (Mr. Aggrey Tisa Sabuni)

      This project became hostage to SETIDP – some Ministries had to wait for
       maintenance to be completed before providing furniture. The four that weren’t
       included the Executive Office of the President. The contractor was ready to
       refurbish but the offices were not vacated.
      Most of the directors that needed furniture have indeed received it.
      Given procurement and transport difficulties the furniture arrived in South
       Sudan somewhat late. The amount of furniture was large. Later on, some
       ministers looked down on the furniture provided by UNOPS and replaced it with
       better quality furniture sets from their own budgets.

7. Public works
CHAIR (Mr. Aggrey Tisa Sabuni)

      This component was lobbied for by UNDP as a way of engaging idle youth. They
       succeeded to persuade donors through the MDTF to approve budget addition.
Professor Ladu Lodu Bureng, Min. of Finance, CES:


                                         42
    It would be good to include a breakdown of what the money was spent on in
     each State. Money was spent through implementing Agencies; the Government
     never saw the money and parallel systems were used throughout. Overall a
     quantification of outputs of public works needs to be provided for completeness
     of this evaluation.
MOGEI:

     It would be good to have a numerical breakdown of the public works – eg how
      many boreholes, km of roads built etc.
ACTION: World Bank to respond through Dept. Aid Coordination.

World Bank:

      Issue of national ownership at the State level also raised in the independent
       evaluation of MDTF overall. There was a problem of bypassing MOFEP, working
       straight with line ministries, and sometime even line ministries not being in
       touch with contractors. This is one of the lessons learnt emerging.
CHAIR (Mr. Aggrey Tisa Sabuni):

     Would have been good if the consultant could have been here to answer these
      questions directly. Joint evaluation co-financed by RSS and World Bank would be
      simpler than two ICRs.
World Bank:

      He is DC-based. However WB will get the information and pass it on.

8. Support to the Commissions
CHAIR (Mr. Aggrey Tisa Sabuni):

      The Commissions were all established around June 2006, 6 months after the
       ministries and after the RIEP had begun operating. Therefore this component
       was not included from the outset.
      The World Bank wanted prefabs, which created arguments as Government
       wanted something concrete. In the end, the compromise was that the RIEP
       project would provide some and the Government would meet the rest, on the
       condition that the commissions were built on legitimate plots of land. Originally
       land for 19 Commissions was made available, but issues with land titles have
       become a problem. Plans for 17 of the commissions have not materialized and
       only 2 came up with viable plots: SSACC and SSAC. By the time funding was
       about to come, we experience a fiscal crisis with the fall in global oil prices,



                                          43
       which meant it was impossible for the Government to provide counterpart
       funding to the MDTF.
South Sudan Audit Chamber (SSAC):

      The report is fair in its assessment that there is indeed a 25% completion rate for
       the building.
    The issue of cash flow needs to be elaborated. Money was disbursed to
       contractors upon satisfactory performance, once they had done a reasonable job
       on items as agreed, a tranche of funding would be released. In some cases the
       contractors didn’t know how to manage their money.
    Tax exemptions are still a problem – MOFEP changes procedures often.
    The problem of the unfinished building may be to an extent the Government’s
       fault, and partially the contractors’, not the project’s.
Overall Comments received from Auditor General Mr. Steven K. Wondu

      Sometime in 2006 or 2007, the decision was made to fund the construction of
       the South Sudan Audit Chamber Office. The administration of the project was to
       be under the Ministry of Gender and Social Welfare.
      A piece of land was allocated for the project.
      The process of procurement of a consultancy firm was triggered in 2010 but was
       staggered by the ambiguity of the MDTF on the amount allocated. The Auditor
       General secured US$ 3 million from the government to augment the
       contribution of the MDTF. The cost of the building was finally agreed at US$ 6.7
       million.
      The laying of foundation stone was underway on 6th January 2012 but was
       stopped on the orders of the Vice President.
      The search for an alternative site took four months. Construction finally resumed
       in June 2012.
      The MTDF closed in December 2012.
      The construction is continuing using: a) materials purchased prior to the closure
       of the MDTF; b) the balance of US$ 3 million deemed to be the contribution of
       the government.
      Challenges: a) The assignment of the responsibility for the project to a different
       agency (Ministry of Gender) was an organizational anomaly; b) There was a
       conflicts between financial control and effective implementation. A tendering
       process that takes four years for a ‘Rapid Impact’ project has much to be desired;
       c) The ‘Multi-Donor’ character of the project complicated management and

     Lessons: Base development projects on: 1) Self-reliance. Invest the nation’s
      resources; b) Bilateral arrangements with state partners or multinational
      organizations; c) Turn – key grants or loans.
   CHAIR (Mr. Aggrey Tisa Sabuni):

      Donor money should not be taxed. Regulators may sometimes be suspicious that
       contractors will bring materials for donor project and their own private projects
       in single shipments, which is where the delays arise.
South Sudan Anti-Corruption Commission (SSACC):

      The completion rate for the building is indeed 70%.
      Work was hampered by the way MOFEP handled affairs. Tax exemptions were
       not forthcoming under austerity budget. If we had sat down with donors and
       contractors early on, perhaps we could have made more progress.
      Contractors were not bringing materials quickly due to tax exemption delays.
      Ultimately MDTF left us with somewhat half-finished job. It would be
       appropriate you to extend this project. The building will be finished soon, but
       with our own resources.
