3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The objective of the Social Protection Support Project (SPSP) was to improve the administration of the
Housing and Municipal Service Allowance Program (HMSAP) by: (a) automating the processing of
applications and data in the administrative offices; and (b) piloting a system to electronically link the local
HMSAP administrative offices, regional offices and the Ministry of Social Protection and monitor and
evaluate the effectiveness of the program.
In order to improve cost recovery, in October 1994 the Government of Ukraine issued Decree No. 733
increasing tariffs for housing, water and sewerage, heating and gas. The rapid increase in rents and tariffs
for housing was not socially sustainable without special measures to protect the poor who could not afford
to pay. Therefore, HMSAP was introduced in February 1995 which allowed families whose monthly
payments for housing, utilities, and housing maintenance exceeded 15 % of monthly income to apply for an
allowance equal to the difference. The MLSP requested World Bank's assistance in automating the
processing of applications and data in the HMSAP administrative offices to cope with the increase in
applicants and participants of the program, piloting a system to electronically link local HMSAP offices,
regional offices and MLSP, and monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the program.
Particular development objectives of the Project were: a) to improve the administrative efficiency in local
HMSAP administrative offices by reducing processing applications from around 30 days in 1996 to less
than 2 weeks from receipt of application to notification, and reducing the number of applicants of the
allowance from 4,800-5,300 individuals prior to the start of the project to 3,000 per working station; b) to
improve information availability and management of HMSAP in pilot regions in Dnepropetrovskaya,
Kievskaya, Lvivskaya and Nikolayevskaya oblasts, and the city of Kiev by monitoring program status after
installation of equipment, and preparing an evaluation study focusing on regional differences in programn
participation rates, levels of housing subsidies, staffmng of offices and their effectiveness.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Project Objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
SPSP comprises four components:
(a)    Automation of Data Processing in HMSAP Administrative Offices (US$ 2.47 million
equivalent): Installation of around 800 workstations (monitor, computer and key board) with Uninterrupted
Power Supply (UPS) units, around, 500 printers and diskettes and other initial consumables in HMSAP
administrative offices nationwide;
(b)    Management Information System (US$158,000 equivalent): Installation of 5 workstations with
UPS, modems with communications software, and initial consumables in MSP; installation of 27
workstations with UPS, modems with communications software, and initial consumables in regional
(oblast) HMSAP offices; and installation of 80 modems and communication software in selected local
HMSAP administrative offices.
(c)    Training and Technical Support (US$230,000 equivalent): Provision of 10 workstations with
UPS, 10 printers and initial consumables for the MSP computer training center; classroom and on-site
training and follow-up assistance on software use for local HMSAP administrative offices; and additional
software development.
-2-



(d)    Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$142,000 equivalent): Assistance for
overall project administration; a study to evaluate the effectiveness of HMSAP, including the impact of
automation, and recommendations on additional actions required.
3.4 Revised Components:
Components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
QAG review not available at the time of this project preparation.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall achievement of project objectives is assessed as satisfactory. The project has met its original
development objectives, namely to assist the Government in increasing the administrative efficiency of
HMSAP offices. The project substantially increased automation and computerization of HMSAP offices
in Ukraine through the establishment of single database and network of 756 regional housing subsidies
offices. The project provided support in coordination of government activities and ensured consistency of
central and local governments in provision of social assistance.
The administrative efficiency in the regional HMSAP offices has been increased which is confirmed by the
following indicators: (a) according to the Presidential Decree No. 1239 "On Social Protection of Low
Income People Under Transition to Full Cost Recovery for Housing and Communal Services" dated
September 30,1999, local HMSAP offices have to process the application within no more than 10 days.
With the support of SPSP, this objective has been achieved; (b) the average level of HMSAP recipients
was reduced to 1,800-2,200 participants per workstation.
Rationalizing public expenditures and improving the efficiency of public service provision was consistent
with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 15674-UA) discussed by the Board of Directors
on June 27, 1996.
The Loan original closing date was the end of June 1999. However, in the view of the delay in the Loan
ratification procedure by the Parliament (Verkhovna Rada) of Ukraine and the necessity to complete the
installation of hardware and software, the Loan closing date was extended until the end of June 2000.
4.2 Ouitputs by components:
The principal outcomes of the project are as follows:
(a)    Automation of Data Processing in HMSAP Administrative Offices:
Within the project framework, 1,088 workstations complete with uninterrupted power supply (UPS) units,
37 (central) file servers, and 100 local file servers complete with UPS units, 37 laser printers, 558 matrix
printers and 298 modems complete with all necessary consumables have been purchased. Each of the 756
municipal offices of the Social Allowance Administration and 27 regional offices of the Labor and Social
Protection Administration have at least one workstation to support their daily processing of applications
and calculation of allowances. Workstations have been installed with the latest version of the HMSAP
application software, provided by the USAID/PADCO. The overall computer system has passed
- 3 -



acceptance testing. The work on automation of the HMSAP administrative offices, regional offices, and the
Ministry has been assessed as highly satisfactory.
(b)    Management Information System:
Based upon the project objective to pilot a system to electronically link local HMSAP administrative
offices, regional offices, and the Ministry, all required workstations and modems have been installed and
tested successfully. At present, where the telephone lines and/or e-mail facility are available, data files and
monthly reports can be transmitted between the Ministry and offices electronically. All regional offices
have an access to e-mail and submit their monthly reports and data electronically to the Ministry. In
addition, many local HMSAP offices also transmit their reports and data electronically. PADCO designed
and installed a Website for the MLSP Department of Social Assistance. Oblast departments of social
protection were connected to Internet. Local computer network has been installed at 151 Social Allowance
Administration offices where at least three computers are available to ensure the computer equipment being
used in a most efficient way.
Local HMSAP offices are now capable of exchanging data with the State Tax Administration and its local
offices. Regional housing subsidies offices use modem connection for data exchange with local housing
maintenance organizations, rayon power network, water supply services, gas supply services, and the
Oblast Housing Subsidy Departments which diminishes risks of fraud and errors in the process of including
new participants to the HMSAP. As a result, means testing has become more accurate and social assistance
more targeted.
Overall, the outcome of this Component is assessed as satisfactory.
(c)    Training and Technical Support:
This Component was carried out by the MLSP and USAID/PADCO All required training on the office
procedures and the use of automated systems was completed. Documentation (user's manual) was prepared
and distributed to all users. In the framework of this Component, PADCO delivered training to HSO
specialists through the "National Standing Refresher Course," a 40-hour program designed and developed
by PADCO that includes training in the use of applied software, its functional capacities and operation
features, as well as a thorough coverage of the basic normative acts and procedures of the housing subsidy
program. In addition, PADCO experts designed and delivered a two-week training program for the heads of
local HSOs attending the Republican Standing Refresher Course within the MLSP.
Over the project three-year period: (a) one-week courses were delivered to 31 groups of trainees, including
613 specialists from a total of 447 HSOs; (b) a shorter course called NASH DIM (Our House) was
delivered to 10 groups of the heads of local HSOs, including 198 trainees from 163 HSOs; (c) 25 regional
seminars were designed and delivered by PADCO in 17 oblast centers, and about 780 officers of the
district Social Allowance Administration have been trained. All users of the automated system have an
access to "a technical advisory hotline" to provide the day-to-day operational guidance support as needed.
Achievement of the objective of this Component is assessed as highly satisfactory.
(d)    Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation:
The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy was responsible for project implementation. However, the formal
- 4 -



PIU was not established at the MLSP as it was envisaged at the appraisal stage. The Project was
implemented by the Department of Social Assistance of the MLSP. Monthly reports about the program
status in all five pilot regions (Dnepropetrovskaya, Kievskaya, Lvivskaya and Nikolayevskaya oblasts, and
the city of Kiev) after installation of equipment were produced, and the program is being monitored jointly
by the MLSP and PADCO, including staffing levels of offices and effectiveness of local HMSAP
administrative offices, beneficiaries of the system, poverty among beneficiaries and benefit levels.
Overall, the outcome of this Component is assessed as satisfactory.
Successful completion of the project was achieved with a significant technical support and parallel grant
financing by USAID/PADCO. In particular, the technical support provided by USAID included installing
computers and Local Area Networks (LANs) in housing subsidy offices (HSOs); establishing electronic
communications links with 122 HSOs in pilot regions; developing and implementing information systems
for HMSAP; improving, distributing and maintaining "NASH DIM" caseload management software;
developing, distributing and maintaining the electronic library "Social Protection":, preparing and
distributing new Office Procedure Manuals, training HSO staff and conducting sociological surveys of
local HSOs with the purpose to evaluate services to recipients of housing subsidies according to
requirements of the World bank.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The impact of the Project achieved most of its intended development objectives. The project supported
major enhancements in the infrastructure of HMSAP offices at national, regional and local levels through
the provision of modem information technology and automation, and equipment of facilities with modem
equipment. The project assisted in capacity building with respect to HMSAP offices dealing with
applicants of housing allowances. The SPSP assisted in training of cadres involved in provision of HMSAP
benefits. The project provided assessment of effectiveness of current Ukrainian housing allowances system.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5 1 Factors outside the control of governnment or inmplenmenting agency:
Initial delays with project effectiveness were caused by complications with ratification of the project in the
Parliament of Ukraine. Although the administrative efficiency of the HMSAP program has substantially
increased, full cost recovery of production costs in housing sector, as it was initially anticipated in the
project design, has not been reached yet. The Government has prepared draft legislation for the elimination
of budgetary support for housing and utilities, but according to Parliament decision from 1999, full cost
recovery cannot be implemented until arrears on pensions and wages are eliminated.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government and MLSP were committed to the project from the very beginning. Strong commitment
and ownership of all key agencies (MLSP, National Agency of Ukraine for Development and European
Integration, Ministry of Finance, Cabinet of Ministers) facilitated successful project implementation.
However, changes in the Government, sometimes inadequate coordination between different Government
bodies also contributed to the project extension by one year.
- 5 -



5.3 Factors generally subject to iniplenienting agency control:
Permanent changes among the key staff responsible for the project in the MLSP also had an impact on
project implementation. During the period of 1996-2000 (project preparation and implementation phase), 3
Ministers of Labor and Social Policy have been changed. Teams working on the project also changed
frequently. On the other hand, technical assistance to the project provided by USAID/PADCO was used
properly and efficiently which contributed to its successful completion.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Total project cost was estimated at US$ 2.6 million equivalent at appraisal. Undisbursed amount of the
Loan equals US $ 1,965. Therefore 99,92% of the Loan proceeds has been disbursed. Since technical
assistance to the MLSP was provided by USAID/PADCO and was covered by grant financing, the need for
consultants services funding reduced. As the key purpose of the Loan was to increase the efficiency of
HMSAP, the MLSP proposed to use unallocated funds for purchasing additional computer equipment for
local housing subsidies offices which made it possible to integrate processing of data on different types of
allowance recipients and forecast budget expenditures for social support of low-income population.
Respectively, reallocation of funds took place: the amount of Category 1 "Goods has been increased by US
$ 299,000; Category 2 "Consultants Services" has been decreased by US $ 29,000.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sutstainability rating:
Overall, the sustainability of the project is highly likely. The Ukrainian authorities are committed to
strengthen the social assistance system and improve the government performance in processing the whole
set of targeted social assistance benefits. This is confirmed by the Decree of the President of Ukraine "On
Social Protection Measures to Support Low-Income Residents During the Period of Transition to Full
Recovery of Housing and Municipal Services Costs" dated September 30, 1999, and Regulations of the
Cabinet of Ministers "On Changes and Amendments to Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine
on Housing and Municipal Service Allowances and Other Targeted Social Assistance to Low Income
Households" dated February 2, 2000. The MLSP computer center has assumed responsibility for the
further development of software and for caseload management and reporting. New reporting and auditing
systems are under development.
6.2 Transition arr-angement to regular operations:
None
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in lending is assessed as satisfactory. The standard investment loan was chosen as
an appropriate lending instrument for this type of Bank operation. The Bank's preparation of the project
involved close coordination with Government counterparts and intemational organizations
(USAID/PADCO). At its identification stage the project was identified and designed in a way to ensure
consistency of its objectives with the Govermment priorities and CAS at that time. Bank assisted the
Borrower with project preparation in all major relevant aspects: technical, financial, procurement and
disbursement. Main project risks were identified properly and the project design ensured mitigation of
possible risks. Performance indicators to identify development objectives and project outcomes were
developed adequately. However, one of the performance indicators to eliminate by September 1997
- 6 -



Government budgetary support for housing maintenance, water and sewerage, heating, hot water and gas
enterprises has been rejected as inappropriate due to current economic situation in the country.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performnance in supervision is assessed as satisfactory. Implementation problems were identified
early and addressed proactively. Since 1998, project supervision has been provided by local staff of the
Bank Country Office in Ukraine which helped to ensure consistency in supervision process and accelerate
decision-making process. The Bank's staff showed flexibility in approving modifications and changes in the
project design, responding to requests by the Government of Ukraine. Close cooperation and coordination
of all key stakeholders involved in supervision process (MLSP, Ministry of Finance, Bank,
USAID/PADCO) was ensured. Nevertheless, supervision of the whole project was somewhat complicated
due to the parallel financing and activities by a major international technical assistant to the project.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall bank's performance is assessed as satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrowers performance in lending is assessed as satisfactory. From the early stage of project design,
the Government in general, and particularly MLSP demonstrated strong commitment to project
preparation. There was close cooperation at the time of project preparation between the Government and
the Bank, and the leadership and vision provided by the main counterpart, the MLSP, ensured that the
project was appropriate to Ukraine's needs. Representatives from all key counterpart's agencies were
involved in loan preparation.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance is assessed as satisfactory. Some delays in implementation from
the Government's side were caused by lack of coordination between different government agencies rather
than by absence of commitment. Adequate counterpart funds were provided on a timely basis which also
demonstrated strong government commitment in project implementation. Based on the final audit report,
Government contribution was increased by US $ 270,000 compared to estimations at the stage of project
appraisal. At the same time, key management officials responsible for project implementation were
frequently changed. In 1998, the Ministry of Social Protection was merged with the Ministry of Labor, and
the MLSP was established. In 1999/2000 in Ukraine, a public administration reform took place, and
reorganization within the Ukrainian Government influenced project implementation process again.
7.6 Inmplementing Agency:
A forrmal PIU has not been established in the MLSP as it was envisaged at the appraisal stage. The
performance of MLSP as an implementing agency is assessed as satisfactory. Certain delays in project
implementation were caused by changes in the MLSP team responsible for SPSP preparation and
implementation, and inadequate financing of administration of programs. However, the Ministry's strong
commitrnent to and governance of the project assured effective project management and efficient use of
technical assistance provided in the project framework.
7.7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
Overall Borrower's performance is assessed as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned
1. Lending must be supported with thorough technical assistance: Successful implementation of the
project can be attributed to the fact that the Bank and USAID/PADCO teams worked closely with the
Ministry on almost all aspects of implementation of the housing subsidy program - from collaborating
in drafting governmental decrees, designing application forms, providing computers to local offices,
developing computer software to calculate subsidies and maintain records, teaching local staff how to
use software, evaluating program, and providing support to the Ministry in identifying opportunities to
improve the program. Although computerization of administrative systems have been introduced as free
standing Bank projects, procurement of computers without appropriate software and adequate capacity
building would not have accomplished any of the project objectives.
2. Training of staff in the use of computer technologies and in the management of information
exchange: The MLSP would not have so readily adapted to the implementation of computerized
caseload software in regional and local offices unless the ministry's program staff and the staff of local
housing offices would not have been trained in the use of computers and other equipment. The
development of regular training programs for the staff of all levels was crucial for the success of the
project.
3. Support in monitoring and evaluation of programs: The MLSP now recognizes the importance of
information management as the key to administer targeted social assistance programs. The MLSP
supported the development of Monitoring Center to provide the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry
itself with timely and comprehensive data on caseloads and program expenditures. The MLSP also
supported the development of oblast level MIS systems based on automatic data transfer from local
offices to respective oblast departments. Nevertheless, staffing limitations of HMSAP at national and
regional levels and financing restrictions imposed on the MLSP have not allowed to fully develop such
activities. Although the housing subsidy program allocates UAH 1.6 billion, or nearly US$ 300 million
annually, the Ministry's Department of Social Assistance has only 8 people working on housing
allowances, and in each oblast, 4-5 people at most.
4. Absence of formal PIU complicates project implementation: Given the small size of the project and
its relatively simple structure, the decision made by the MLSP not to have a formal PIU was probably
correct. However, for more comprehensive projects related to automation of administrative systems, the
establishment of a formal PIU is advisable. In addition, delays in project implementation were caused
by changes in the core project management team. Continuity in project management can also provide
needed stability in implementing project activities.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
In its comments the MLSP indicated the following.
The Project was designed to attain the following objectives:
I.     Ensuring an efficient use of the relevant budgetary assignments as a result of the process or
transition from the inconsistent broad-subsidizing practice to the target social means-tested allowance
program to support the low-income households, based on assessment of their average monthly aggregate
incomes and actual financial situations.

2.     Developing efficient and effective national social programs to secure target support to the
low-income households in the transitional period of the social and economic reforms, thereby providing
against possible social tension in the country.
3.    Improving the targeting dimension of the national social protection programs to support the
low-income households by means of the housing and municipal service allowance.
4.     Improving the quality of the social allowance administration services provided to the households,
throughout the qualification and payment process.
5.     Improving the quality of the state-level and local-level administrative control over implementation
of the national social protection programs to support the low-income categories of residents.
6.     Putting in place a necessary groundwork to build up a consistent data-collecting and processing
system to monitor the progress of different national social protection programs and, first of all, the housing
and municipal service allowance programs.
The above Project objectives are basically achieved today.
Soon after the necessary application software was installed at every local office of the Social Allowance
Administration, the offices have managed to simplify the accounts and shorten the accounts processing
time, thereby preventing possible social tension and securing necessary support to the low-income
categories of residents in the process of transition to the hundred-percent recovery of the housing and
municipal service costs by the category of residential consumers.
Computer equipment is required to ensure the whole process of the housing and municipal service
allowance processing and qualification that includes: registration of applications; documents processing
followed by the allowance qualification and rating; preparation of monthly registers of the subsidized
households that are provided to the relevant housing and municipal service utilities; and formation of
statistical reports. In addition, special application software functions are available for restatement of the
effective social benefits.
Purchase of computers followed by the necessary operation-and-application software installation for
account of the Social Protection Support Project (Housing and Municipal Services Allowance Program) at
the local offices of the Social Allowance Administration, has enabled to facilitate the data processing on the
average monthly aggregate incomes, to arrive at the 15-percent and 20-percent income rates within the
frame of the means-testing analysis. The average processing load has been reduced to 2.2 thousand
applications per every office PC.
Since the special application software for processing data on the households applying and qualified for the
housing and municipal service allowance was installed at every local office of the Social Allowance
Administration, the offices have been able to process the relevant documentation separately for each
category of accounts payable to every public service utility. Furthermore, the offices has been able to
introduce incentives system to encourage the subsidized households to use the primary energy supplies in a
most efficient manner. This was made by means of a payment reduction plan conditional on the efficient
use of the energy supplies, and the plan has resulted in the budgetary assignments required for the
allowance dropping down by some UAH 39.3 per the year.
Moreover, the Social Allowance Administration offices are now capable of exchanging data with the State

Tax Administration headquarters and its local offices. This function of the system provides means to
minimize risks of fraudulent misrepresentation and/or human error in the process of the housing and
municipal service allowance processing and qualification, as may happen when incomplete or incorrect
information is provided on the applicant's incomes and financial position. Only for the first six months of
the year of 2000, these data cross-checks have revealed some 25.2 thousand cases of incorrect statements
worth around UAH 2,122.2 thousand in overpaid allowance that was eventually paid back to the national
budget; these refunds made up 0.2 percent of the total amount of the housing and municipal service
allowance paid during the period.
One of the major impediments in the Project implementation period was the lack of an independent
administrative task force (Project implementation unit), while only a limited number of (local) experts was
available for coordination of activities under the Project. This was apparently the prime reason for some
delays and misconceptions during the cooperative efforts of the Ministry of Labor and the World Bank
missions.
These problems have been successfully solved through the persistent efforts and constructive cooperation
of all the experts involved in the Project, who had the most efficient and timely support throughout the
whole process from the resident officers of the World Bank.
It was of great importance that the officers of the World Bank Resident Mission in Kyiv have always
assisted the Ministry by most adequate and competent actions in quite often complicated situations, and
helped the Ministry to solve crucial problems encountered during the Project implementation period.
It was the reasonable flexibility of the World Bank when considering the loan disbursement arrangements
that, as we believe, eventually secured the fulfillment of the objectives set forth by the Ministry for the
Project implementation period.
In addition, it is pertinent to note that the Ministry staff, appreciating the opportunity to work in close
cooperation of with the World Bank officers and consultants and the PADCO experts, has gained much
from the best intemational experience and practice and has taken advantage of them both solving the
present-day problems in the sector and gaining a more penetrating insight into the social protection system
advancement strategy on the whole.
It is pertinent to note that the Ukrainian side has mostly supported the Project by financing the activities to
establish essential infrastructure and environment in the Project offices, to ensure that computer equipment
is being used in a most efficient manner. The activities included installation of the necessary safety
equipment and security systems, as well as fire alarm systems, in the offices. Total spending of the
Ukrainian side for the above purposes was estimated at US$ 363 thousand as of January 1, 2000, that
means it has exceeded the budgeted amount.
Based on the practical experience gained during the Project implementation period, the following
conclusions may be made:
1.     Using the modem computer technologies is of paramount importance for progress of all efforts to
perfect the social protection system in terms of better support to the low-income residential categories.
Furthermore, no progress can be made unless the local labor and social protection offices are well equipped
with all necessary equipment and supported at the same time by target technical assistance to be provided
on a complex basis and with adequate follow-up services.

2.     In view of the limited number of experts available in the central executive agencies of Ukraine, it is
advisable to establish an independent administrative task team (Project implementation unit) to take
responsibility for current management of all the implementation activities under the projects of that kind.
