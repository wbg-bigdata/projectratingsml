                    Enhanced revenue collection with lower administrative costs and corruption:
Results 1
                    Tax revenue increases by €500 million to €37.5 billion in 2014, from €37 billion in 2011.
                    Tax administration costs are reduced to 1.05 percent of tax revenue in 2014, from 1.11
                    percent in 2011.
                    Implementation of EU Fiscal Convergence Program:
                    The general Government budget deficit is below 3 percent of GDP in cash terms as of
                    2012.
                    Governance reform of energy state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
                    Improve accountability of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings and attract
                    private capital:
                     Extra revenue of euro 70 million from higher sale prices in the renegotiated bilateral
                    contracts and avoided estimated loss of euro 73 million from non-acquisition of high-cost
                    thermal power, for a total benefit of about euro 143 million, in 2013 and 2014.

                    Electricity prices for non-residential consumers are fully deregulated by end-2013 (and
                    thereafter).
                    Regulated tariff sales account for a maximum of 25 percent of Romania‟s electricity
                    supply in 2014. Sales in the OPCOM Power Exchange and Transelectrica balancing
                    generation account for a minimum of 50 percent of Romania‟s SOEs‟ generation in 2014.
                    Directly negotiated bilateral contracts account for a maximum of 20 percent of Romania‟s
                    SOEs‟ electricity generation in 2014 and prices in these contracts reflect market prices at
                    the OPCOM Power Exchange.

                   Fiscal sustainability of the health sector
                   Rationalize public health spending:
                   Potential savings estimated at Euro 100 million by 2014 as a result of a revision of the
                   basic package of health services.
                   Hospital beds contracted by NHIH in public and private hospitals is decreased to 125,639
                   in 2012, and to no more than 123,127 in 2013, compared to 129,524 in 2011.
                   The budget allocation to health prevention and promotion programs increases to 15
                   percent of the MoH budget for National Health Programs in 2015.
Program            The objective of the proposed DPL-DDO is to support the Government of Romania‟s
Development        efforts to meet the fiscal sustainability goals as defined by the EU Fiscal Compact. The
Objective(s) and   reforms proposed to be supported aim to: (i) improve public financial management to
Contribution to    enhance the efficiency of public spending and the Government‟s revenue-raising capacity
CPS                through better enforcement of tax laws; (ii) improve governance of SOEs in the energy
                   sector to generate savings, and attract the private capital needed to modernize plants and
                   increase their competitiveness; and (iii) enhance fiscal sustainability of public health care
                   through the reduction of unjustified outlays and the reallocation of resources to high-
                   return preventive care and health promotion programs. In addition, the DPL-DDO
                   contributes to the Government‟s fiscal buffer, but without requiring actual disbursement
                   of funds.
                   The overarching objective of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2013, updated
                   by a Progress Report presented to the Board in December 2011, is to pursue public sector
                   reform, growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion. The DPL-DDO
                   approaches these reform objectives from the perspective of fiscal sustainability, which the
                   Government sees as a prerequisite for the longer term growth under the CPS.
Risks and Risk     Risks and capacity constraints are substantial, and the authorities are taking steps to
Mitigation         mitigate them:
                   Economic risks stem mainly from economic and financial turmoil in the Eurozone.
                   Lower growth prospects in the EU and elsewhere could suppress demand for exports and
                   capital inflows, put pressure on fiscal and external balances and undermine growth
                   prospects. These risks are compounded by sluggish recovery of domestic demand, low
                   absorption of EU structural and cohesion funds, and the need to refinance the sizeable
                   short-term debt. Externally-driven financial risks are compounded by the large proportion
                   of foreign-owned banks and by the high degree of the euroization of the Romanian
                   economy.
                   Social risks stem from the lingering effects of past fiscal austerity measures, SOE reforms
                   that may include staff reductions, and impact of a possible renewed recession. Salaries of
                   public sector employees and pensions have not yet recovered to the level before the 2010
                   austerity measures. Also the planned liberalization of energy tariffs can be expected to
                   affect negatively economic activity and the livelihood of households.
                   Political risks come from the change in Government in May 2012, and the impact of local
                   and parliamentary elections in June and November 2012, respectively.
                   Capacity constraints include the lack of strategic planning, weak Government and public
                   administration capacity to formulate and implement reforms, and insufficient Parliament
                   capacity to evaluate and harmonize legislative initiatives.
                   Economic risks are mitigated partially by the commitment of the Government to continue
                   implementing the reform agenda supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and


                                                    iv
                  European Union (EU) under their precautionary arrangements, as well as the agenda
                  supported by the proposed DPL-DDO. Romania‟s incipient economic recovery as of 2011
                  and improved macroeconomic balances should position the country to better withstand
                  external pressures. Public financial management reforms supported by the DPL-DDO are
                  expected to bolster budget revenues, contain current budget expenditure, and protect
                  public capital spending. In the energy sector, fiscal savings and private sector investments
                  are anticipated following the implementation of the planned reforms. Financial risks have
                  been so far managed well by the Romanian authorities, and further measures to strengthen
                  sector resilience are underway with support from the IMF. An important operational risk
                  mitigation measure is that if the Bank assesses that at least one of the two drawdown
                  conditions - an adequate macroeconomic or satisfactory program implementation - is not
                  met and has notified Romania to this effect, the Bank will not disburse under the DPL-
                  DDO.
                  Social risks are mitigated in part by social assistance measures, such as energy subsidies
                  for vulnerable households, and the provision of essential public health services for
                  vulnerable households, including an exemption from co-payments. Fiscal consolidation
                  objectives have been revised by the new government in line with its goal of stimulating
                  domestic demand and to respect its commitments to restore public administration wages
                  to the June 2010 level, and refund the deductions from pensions for health insurance ruled
                  illegal by the Constitutional Court. The new fiscal framework projects a budget deficit of
                  2.2 percent of GDP in 2012, below the 3 percent ceiling proposed by the EU Fiscal
                  Compact.
                  Political risks are mitigated by the continuous dialogue of the Bank and other IFIs with
                  the opposition parties that are now in power, and by the firm commitment expressed by
                  the new Government to continue the fiscal consolidation and economic reform program
                  agreed by the previous administration. The new Government enjoys political legitimacy
                  and popular support, and is determined to strengthen its dialogue with Parliament and
                  other stakeholders to successfully implement the financial and economic program. There
                  is a broad agreement across the political spectrum on the need to continue macroeconomic
                  stabilization and economic reforms. Romania is expected to respect its commitments

                                      I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed Development Policy Loan with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DPL-
DDO) for an amount of €1 billion aims to support the Government of Romania’s efforts to
meet the objectives of fiscal sustainability as defined by the EU Fiscal Compact. Since late-
2008, Romania has had to cope with persistent economic difficulties and financial turbulence in
the European Union (EU) and elsewhere. Despite the resumption of growth in 2011, Romania‟s
economic prospects in 2012 remain weak. Although the country is currently able to raise
sufficient financing on both domestic and international markets, its access to capital markets
could be constrained at any point by the higher-than-usual volatility in the international markets,
particularly in the EU. To address these challenges, the Government has approached the World
Bank and other International Financial Institutions (IFIs) for support.

2.      The proposed DPL-DDO is part of a multilateral package that includes
precautionary arrangements agreed by Romania with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the European Union (EU). In April-May 2011, the IMF and the EU approved a
two-year precautionary financial assistance arrangements for SDR 3,090.6 million (about €3.4
billion) and €1.4 billion, respectively. The fourth review of these programs was completed in
January-February 2012 and concluded that the programs are on track.

3.      The proposed DPL-DDO supports the Government’s reform agenda in three areas:
First, improved public financial management to enhance the quality and efficiency of public
spending, and the Government‟s revenue-raising capacity through better enforcement of tax
laws. Second, improved governance of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings, attract the
private capital needed to modernize plants, and increase the competitiveness of the sector. Third,
improved fiscal sustainability of public health spending through the reduction of unjustified
outlays and reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and health promotion
programs.

4.     In addition, the proposed DPL-DDO counts towards the fiscal buffer of the
Government without requiring disbursements of funds. The Romanian Government is
building a €4 billion fiscal buffer (equivalent to around 4 months of budget financing needs) for
2012 and onwards, which is defined in the Government Public Debt Strategy 2011-2013 and in
the Fiscal Budgetary Strategy for 2012-2014, and is in the accordance with Fiscal Compact
Convergence Program for 2012-2015. The buffer aims to protect the economy against external
shocks, and the authorities plan to use it only if, owing to external shocks or unforeseen events
beyond Government‟s control, their financing strategy is challenged. The Government could
draw the DPL-DDO funds from the fiscal buffer provided the medium-term macroeconomic
framework is appropriate and satisfactory progress has been made with the reform agenda
supported by the operation.

5.     The proposed DPL-DDO is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
The DPL-DDO is central to the Bank‟s engagement in the country. The Progress Report on the
CPS presented to the Board in December 20112 stressed the pursuit of public sector reform,
growth and competitiveness, and social and spatial inclusion. It also highlighted policy reforms

2011.
in tax administration, energy, transport and financial sector to meet EU convergence objectives,
modernization of public administration, and absorption of EU funds. The DPL-DDO program
approaches these reform objectives from the perspective of fiscal sustainability, which the
Government sees as a prerequisite for the longer-term growth and reforms agreed under the CPS.
The proposed operation is complemented by World Bank financing of a results-based operation
supporting increased effectiveness of social assistance3, the implementation of Government‟s
action plans derived from the recommendations of the Functional Reviews (FRs), and technical
assistance for strategic planning through the implementation of medium term budgeting
processes.

6.     The proposed operation follows the successful implementation of the Development
Policy Loan (DPL) series which was part of a multilateral package by IFIs that helped
Romania manage the impact of the global economic and financial crisis during 2009-2011.
Romania implemented a set of reforms that were supported by a series of three DPLs that
disbursed a total of €1 billion during 2009-2011. In parallel, the IMF and the EU supported
policy-based arrangements that provided about €18 billion in balance of payments and budget
support. The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) provided an additional €1 billion in private sector support. The 2009-2011
macroeconomic targets agreed by the Government with IFIs were met or exceeded, and the
reform agenda was, for the most part, delivered on time and as intended. As described in section
V-A, the Government implemented satisfactorily, albeit with some delay, reforms supported by
the DPL series.

7.     Good macroeconomic management and fiscal discipline helped Romania navigate
the financial crisis and begin a recovery in 2011. The steep recession of 2009-2010 started to
recede in 2011. The fiscal and external current account deficits were sharply reduced during
2009-2011, the exchange rate remained stable, and sovereign debt manageable and below the
EU-recommended ceiling. The financial sector weathered the crisis well; no banks failed and the
National Bank of Romania (NBR) did not have to intervene to rescue banks. Unemployment was
below the EU average. Inflation declined in 2011 to the lowest level in 20 years.

8.      Romania’s medium-term growth and fiscal stability prospects are favorable,
provided the uncertainty in international markets diminishes, and the Eurozone financial
crisis is overcome. A growth rate of 1.5 percent is forecast in 2012 and this is expected to
accelerate gradually in the medium term, absent external shocks. Romania has joined the Treaty
on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (henceforth
referred to as the Fiscal Compact) that limits the medium-term structural fiscal deficit to 0.5 or
1.04 percent of GDP, and the cash budget deficit to 3 percent of GDP. The fiscal framework for
2012 is consistent with these objectives, as is the macroeconomic framework for 2012-2015.

9.      However, significant downside risks remain. Main risks stem from the economic and
financial turmoil in the Eurozone, and domestic politics. The medium term recovery of the
Romanian economy relies on foreign direct investment (FDI), domestic demand and export

  As per Article 3, para (d) of the Fiscal Compact, EU members having a ratio of the general Government debt to
GDP “significantly below 60 percent and where risks in terms of long term sustainability of public finances are low?
(quote), the structural deficit limit can be raised to one percent of GDP from 0.5 percent.

growth. A prolonged global economic slowdown and in particular delayed recovery in the EU
could stall investment and depress exports. These risks are compounded by low absorption of EU
structural and cohesion funds, and the need to refinance the sizeable short-term debt. Domestic
political risks stem from the electoral agenda of 2012, with local and parliamentary elections
scheduled for June and November, 2012, respectively. Social risks include the lingering effect of
the 2010-11 fiscal austerity measures, and may increase with the anticipated economic slowdown
and resulting impact on employment and wages. The Government‟s capacity can affect its ability
to formulate, coordinate and implement policies and programs.



                                II.    COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                  A. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

10.     From late-2008 through April 2012, Romania was governed by a multi-party
coalition that successfully managed the impact of the global financial crisis with strong
backing from the President. The coalition Government, comprised of the Democratic Liberal
Party (DLP), the Hungarian Union of Democrats in Romania (HUDR) and the National Union
for the Progress of Romania (UNPR) vigorously pursued its main objective of fiscal
consolidation. The President assumed the difficult adjustment measures proposed by the
Government, and addressed the nation repeatedly to explain and defend these measures. The
coalition enjoyed steady – if fragile – parliamentary support, counting on a majority in the lower
chamber and almost parity in the Senate.

11.     In late April 2012 the opposition won a no-confidence vote in Parliament and
formed a new Government in early May. This Government, led by the Social and Liberal
Union (USL), enjoys majority support in both houses of Parliament. The new Government is
composed mostly of seasoned technocrats and administrators, reflecting the intent of the USL to
continue fiscal stabilization and reforms supported by the IFIs, and meet Romania‟s
commitments under the EU Fiscal Pact. The new Prime Minister indicated that USL intends to
respect the EU Fiscal Compact guidelines and to pursue reforms, and has publicly stated it‟s the
Government‟s intention to work with the IFIs in continuing implementation of agreed reforms.
Romania is expected to continue the ongoing macroeconomic stabilization and reform program
irrespective of the outcome of the November 2012 parliamentary elections.

                        B. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS DURING 2009-2011

12.     Romania entered the global financial crisis in 2008 with high growth rates, but also
large macroeconomic imbalances. Real GDP grew at over 6.5 percent per year on average
between 2003 and 2008 on the back of strong growth in the construction, wholesale and retail
sectors. By 2008 the external current account deficit was almost 12 percent of GDP, and the
structural fiscal deficit exceeded 8 percent of GDP (Table 1). The crisis hit Romania hard in the
last quarter of 2008. The economy contracted by almost 13 percent in the last quarter of 2008
compared to an annualized 9 percent growth in the previous quarter. Fiscal revenues plummeted
and Romania faced the prospects of a fiscal deficit spiraling out of control in 2009.



                                                3
13.     The 2008 crisis depressed growth, demand and investment, and forced the
Government to take fiscal austerity measures. The economy contracted by 6.5 percent in real
terms during 2009-2011, domestic demand declined by almost 14 percent, and gross domestic
investment fell by around 25 percent in Euro terms over this period. And yet, facing financing
difficulties and a collapse in revenue, the Government implemented a strong fiscal austerity
package from July 1, 2010, consisting of tax increases and public expenditure cuts:
   Revenue boosting measures included an increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) from 19 to
    24 percent, the introduction of a turnover tax on medical supplies, significant increases in
    property taxes, and the reintroduction of taxes on bank deposit interest and capital gains.
   Expenditure cuts included a 22 percent reduction in the public wage bill through a 25 percent
    wage cut, a 14.2 percent reduction in public sector staffing, and the elimination of most wage
    supplements through the introduction of a unitary pay law (UPL); the implementation of new
    pension indexation guidelines; the reallocation of social assistance benefits5 to well-targeted
    programs; reduced outlays for goods and services; the curtailment of transfers to SOEs and
    close monitoring of financial performance of the ten largest loss-making SOEs; the
    improvement of hospital management6 and containment of drug cost escalation through
    promotion of generic drugs. The Government enforced commitment ceilings in line with
    budget appropriations, and instructed local Governments to include the repayment of arrears
    in budget execution and prohibited committing to new expenditures or contract loans until
    previous obligations are repaid7.

14.     The economy started to recover in 2011. Real GDP grew by 2.5 percent in 2011 aided
by strong performances in agriculture and exports. Positive growth in the construction and retail
trade sectors reflected increasing consumer confidence and an upturn in credit growth. The job
market stabilized; registered unemployment declined to 7.4 percent from a high of 7.6 percent in
2010, well below the EU average of almost 10 percent; and private employment and real wages
started growing again.

15.     External imbalances narrowed in 2011. Exports were almost 31 percent higher in Euro
terms compared with 2008. Strong performance in exports of machinery, automotives and
agricultural goods along with increased absorption of EU funds helped to keep the current
account deficit stable at 4.4 percent of GDP. The real effective exchange rate (REER)
depreciated in late 2008 and early 2009 as the crisis hit Romanian economy, but then gradually
appreciated in 2009-2011 owing to the inflation rate differential with the Eurozone and the
inflationary impact of the VAT increase in mid-20108. The appreciation was largely passed
through without a negative impact on the external balance.

16.     Fiscal austerity measures curtailed deficits, but fiscal challenges persisted. In 2011,
the structural fiscal deficit was cut to 2.8 percent, while the deficit on a cash basis decreased to

GDP in 2011.

  373 hospitals will be managed by local Governments. The National Health Insurance House (CNAS) discontinued
financing for 65 hospitals – of which 32 were converted into permanent care or multi-functional health centers, and
the rest into nursing home for the elderly.
7
  The relevant amendments to the Local Public Finance Law were enacted in June 2010.
8
  Between the end of Q3 2008 and end-Q1 2009 the REER depreciated by around 9 percent. However, by May
2011, it had appreciated to its pre-crisis levels.

4.1 percent. Expenditures were trimmed by more than 2 percent of GDP thanks largely to flat
nominal budgets and reductions in the number of public sector workers. However, notable fiscal
challenges remained. On the revenue side, revenue mobilization continued to underperform due
to weak administration and substantial tax evasion (at 32.4 percent of GDP in 2011 Romania had
one of the lowest ratios of budget revenues to GDP in the EU).9 Fiscal hindrances to investment
and business included the excessive frequency of tax payments and the high level and number of
taxes. Expenditure issues included the SOEs‟ drain on the budget10, and inadequate prioritization
and efficiency of expenditures. The severity of the crisis delayed the implementation of reforms
envisaged by the Government to improve tax collection, reduce customs fraud and absorb EU
structural funds.

of the tax system, audits of tax obligations of high net wealth individuals, and the introduction of compulsory
electronic filing by medium and large taxpayers.

   SOE arrears were estimated at 2.9 percent of GDP at end-2011.

                                                                     5
17.     Smaller fiscal deficits and lower food prices reduced inflation to its lowest level since
1989. Inflation declined to 3.1 percent on a year-on-year basis by end-2011. This allowed the
National Bank of Romania (NBR) to lower the policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 6
percent in November 2011and it has since been lowered further to 5.25 percent. The nominal
exchange rate remained relatively stable vis-à-vis the Euro and the US Dollar during 2011, with
a depreciation of 1.6 percent against the former and an appreciation of 1.2 percent against the
latter over the whole year.

18.     The financial sector weathered well the 2009-2011 crisis. The banking sector remained
well-capitalized and liquid. All banks had capital adequacy ratios in excess of 11 percent, and the
average rate was 14.5 percent at end-2011, compared to the statutory minimum of 8 percent.
Liquid assets exceeded 60 percent of total assets as of end-2011, compared with 47 percent at
end-2008. The banks took steps to reduce costs and protect profitability, including reducing
personnel costs from 42 percent of non-interest expenses at end-2008 to 34 percent at end-2011.
The aggregate exposure of the nine largest foreign-owned banks participating in the European
Bank Coordination Initiative (ECBI) at end-2011 stood at 99 percent of the March 2009 level.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) moved on an upward trend from 2.8 percent in December 2008 to
14.1 percent in December 2011, due to the economic slowdown, declining property prices, and
lax credit practices prior to the onset of the crisis. Credit growth remained weak in real terms and
was dominated by public sector demand. Domestic credit to the private sector expanded in real
terms by only 10 percent in 2009-2011 due to decreased demand and the tightening of lending
standards prompted by worsening asset quality and rising provisioning requirements. At the
same time, domestic credit to the public sector increased in real terms from 8 percent of total
bank loans at end-2008 to 33.6 percent at end-2011.

19.     The authorities took steps in 2009-2011 to manage financial sector risks. The NBR
strengthened prudential regulations, tested the robustness of their own contingency plans for
intervention in the financial sector in the event of financial stress, and put in place an enhanced
reporting framework for supervised banks. The authorities approved a legal framework for the
creation of a „bridge bank‟ as a tool to manage financially troubled banks in the event of
systemic threats. The Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) was granted full membership in the
National Committee for Financial Stability, thus guaranteeing DGF rapid access to funding from
the Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) to meet its obligations.

20.     The Government also took steps to mitigate the poverty impact of the economic
crisis. Higher and better targeted social protection11 spending and pension increases in 2009
mitigated the effect of the crisis on the poor, with 5.2 percent of the population living in absolute
poverty in 201012 (up from 4.4 percent in 2009) compared to 5.7 percent in 2008 and 35.9
percent a decade earlier. The cuts in public sector wages and untargeted social transfers affected
mostly the better-off groups rather than the poor: the minimum wage floor of 700 RON per
maintains the living standards of civil-servant households above the poverty line, the social
assistance programs that have been curtailed affected mostly middle and upper income
households, and the budget of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI, the best-targeted social
assistance program) and the family allowances program was protected. The 2010-2011 freeze in
11
   See the DPL3 Program Document (Report 64772-RO) for a discussion of targeting of the social assistance
programs.

   About 30 percent of the population lives below USD 5 per day. 2011 poverty figures are expected by May 2012.

pensions was accompanied by an increase of the minimum monthly pension to RON350. Since
over two thirds of female headed households are also pensioners this measure benefitted women
in particular.

                                  C. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

21.     Romania’s medium term macroeconomic outlook is positive, although at risk given
the challenges faced by EU countries. Growth is projected at 1.5 percent for 2012, and to
accelerate gradually to 4 percent by 2015. Growth is expected to remain below pre-crisis levels
in the medium term and be driven by factors different from the external credit-fueled growth and
speculative ventures that characterized growth in the 2000s.

22.     The economic growth of 1.5 percent in 2012 is projected to be driven mainly by
increasing domestic demand and absorption of EU funds, with some contribution from
exports. Consumer confidence and domestic demand have shown signs of recovery and are
expected to continue to improve during 2012. In parallel, the recently created Ministry of
European Affairs is striving to enhance the commitments of EU funds, specifically for transport
and regional development projects, and the Government expects to increase the absorption of EU
funds in 2012 The official target of €6 billion (4.4 percent of GDP) in EU reimbursements in
2012, however, is unlikely to materialize. Therefore, these growth projections are based on a
target of €2 billion, which is more realistic. Gross exports are forecast to increase only
moderately, by about 5 percent of GDP, which is slower than in recent years due to the sluggish
demand from the EU, Romania‟s main export market. At the same time imports are projected to
rise by over two percent of GDP as consumer demand and exports with high import content pick
up.
23.     Growth is expected to rise to 4 percent by 2015, buoyed primarily by further rising
domestic demand and measures to improve competitiveness. The resumption and doubling of
credit growth over the medium term will help sustain the rise in domestic demand. To boost
competitiveness, the authorities are taking steps to control production costs through wage
restraint and the control of inflation. The new Labor Code adopted in 2011 will facilitate this in
the private sector by promoting greater labor market flexibility, while the Government will
continue to exercise restraint in public sector salary increases. In addition, the authorities plan to
proceed with structural reforms that facilitate private sector activity. These include the
simplification of the taxation system, improvements in the regulatory environment, measures to
safeguard energy security, and increased investment in infrastructure, notably through EU
funded transport projects. Specifically, public investment is projected to exceed 7 percent of
GDP by 2014 when the absorption of EU funds will kick in. The EU Fiscal Compact will act as
an anchor to ensure a stable and predictable macroeconomic framework, which in turn will
encourage confidence in the economic management and help to attract foreign direct investment.

24.     The external balance is projected to stabilize in the medium term, with the current
account deficit around 5 percent of GDP starting in 2013. As mentioned above, the economic
slowdown in EU member countries is expected to dampen Romania‟s foreign trade prospects
and reduce the high export growth rates recorded in 2009-2011. The FDI balance is expected to
remain positive in the medium-term, although at only a fraction of the pre-crisis levels. Potential
privatizations may improve FDI prospects. The exchange rate is expected to remain stable in the
absence of unforeseen shocks.

                                                  7
25.      The inflation rate is projected to stabilize over the medium-term at around 2.5
percent. Slow growth combined with a smaller effect from international food and fuel prices are
likely to maintain inflation within the NBR target band of 3±1 percent. However, the risks are
tilted towards higher inflation due to projected increases in energy prices in accordance with the
EU Third Package of Energy Reforms, and given persisting tensions in international oil markets.

26.     Romania aims to meet the ambitious fiscal consolidation targets of the EU Fiscal
Compact. The fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2011 to 2.2
percent in 2012 and stabilize at 1.7 percent between 2014 and 2015. The new Government
softened the 2012 fiscal deficit target by 0.3 percent of GDP from initial plans to partly reverse
the public administration wage cuts introduced during the crisis and to refund the deductions
from pensions for health insurance, which were ruled illegal by the Constitutional Court. These
measures will provide some degree of economic stimulus to help mitigate the impact of slow
demand for exports, while Romania remains well within the limits agreed under the Fiscal
Compact. Romania expects to achieve its medium term objective (MTO) of 0.7 percent of GDP13
structural fiscal deficit target through modest increases in tax revenue, and continued expenditure
restraint through a series of measures, including a reduction in the wage bill through continued
reductions in public employment by replacing only one in seven departing staff; a cut in capital
expenditures by terminating poorly performing projects, reducing national co-financing from 15
to 5 percent, and cutting some non-EU funded capital spending, cuts in transfer to SOEs; and the
implementation of health reforms. Meeting this fiscal objective will also require the
implementation of reforms to pensions and other social transfers.

27.     The banking sector remains vulnerable due to the high proportion of foreign-owned
banks (about 85 percent of capital) and the high share of loans denominated in foreign
currency (65-70 percent of corporate and household loans). These risks are mitigated by the
stable exchange rate and the strict supervision of the sector by the NBR. There also remains a
risk of deleveraging by foreign-owned banks, but this risk has been reduced by the European
Central Bank‟s recent liquidity provisions to the banking system.

28.     Romania has also adopted measures to manage risks and safeguard financial
stability. The NBR is monitoring the situation closely and re-running liquidity and solvency
stress tests to identify eventual capitalization needs. It stands ready to provide liquidity as
necessary to mitigate segmentation in the interbank market. The authorities are also addressing
the issue of NPLs which have accumulated on bank balance sheets. First, they plan to revise the
tax treatment of bank loans sold to Romanian companies to remove tax disincentives that
discourage the sale of non-performing loans to specialist entities, and undertake an assessment of
the arrangements for insolvency and creditor rights in spring 2012. Second, NBR is planning to
extend the restructuring period for bank loans that continue to perform under the restructured
terms. Third, the authorities intend to finalize procedures for deploying the bank resolution
powers, including bridge bank financing and purchase and assumption powers. In parallel, the
Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF), the NBR and the Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) plan to
jointly review and approve in 2012 the operational preparedness and inter-agency arrangements
for the financial safety net.

29.     The Government recognizes governance challenges and has adopted a National
Anticorruption Strategy for 2012-201514 to address them. Weak governance has likely
affected the growth trajectory and the pace of recovery. Over half of Romanian firms identify
corruption as a major constraint to doing business and Romania underperforms in the
Transparency International‟s Corruption Perception Index and the World Governance Indicators
on corruption, even compared to non-EU European countries. Regulatory quality, associated
with faster productivity growth, has been improving, but it is lower than in all other EU
countries. The implementation of the competition policy also lags other European countries. The
National Anticorruption Strategy provides a medium term strategic vision to address these and
other challenges.15 A monitoring and evaluation system to track the strategy implementation has
been established, and progress will be reviewed annually.

                                 D. THE INDEBTEDNESS AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

30.     External indebtedness is high, but projected to decline over the medium term.
External debt peaked in 2010 at almost 75 percent of GDP, but is projected to decline gradually
through 2015 to 61.3 percent of GDP in spite of the slightly widening current account deficit.
Macroeconomic projections assume that about 40 percent of the future current account deficit
will be financed by non-debt creating capital inflows, i.e., foreign direct investment. Positive
trends notwithstanding, Romania will need to mobilize around Euros 50 billion annually over the
medium term to meet its gross external financing requirements (Table 2). Slowly increasing
exports combined with declining external debt are improving the ratio of external debt to
exports. The ratio of external debt to exports declined in 2011 to 188.2 percent from the peak of
224.5 percent in 2009 and it is projected to decline further by 2015 to about 147.3 percent
(Tables 1 and 2).

31.     Public indebtedness is expected to decline over the medium-term as the fiscal deficit
shrinks. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to increase from 33.0 percent in 2011 to 34.2
percent in 2012, before gradually declining to 32.1 percent by 2015. Similarly, the ratio of public
debt to budget revenues is projected to decline from 105 percent in 2011 to 95.8 percent in 2015
(Table 3).

   The strategy includes measures, for example, to: improve access to public information; strengthen the integrity
and transparency of the judiciary; increase the transparency of political party financing; strengthen the integrity of
the Parliament; improve the public procurement framework enhance competition and the quality of the business
environment; and improve efficiency and transparency of the local public administration.

32.     Sensitivity tests to key macroeconomic variables indicate that Romania’s debt
remains sustainable in the medium term. Sensitivity tests include one-off half-standard
deviation shocks applied to baseline values16 of interest rates, growth and primary balance.
Under the baseline scenario both public and external debts follow downward trajectories in the
medium term (Figures 1 and 2).


Figure 1:Public debt sustainability:                                           Figure 2: External debt sustainability:

Source: IMF, March 2012 and Bank Staff estimates
Notes: Shaded area reflects historical values. Real interest rate shock is baseline interest rate estimation plus one-half standard deviation. Real
GDP growth shock is baseline growth estimation minus one-half standard deviation. Primary balance shock is baseline primary balance
estimation minus one-half standard deviation.


      Public debt shocks: The public debt stock decreases at a slower pace when interest rates
       increase and the primary balance deteriorates compared with the baseline scenario. A
       negative growth shock causes public debt to increase from 33.0 percent of GDP in 2011 to 43
       percent in 2017, compared with a decline to 30.4 percent by 2017 under the baseline
       scenario.
      External debt shocks: External debt declines in the medium term but at a lower rate than in
       the baseline when interest rates increase, and the primary balance and growth suffer negative

16
   The key medium-term baseline assumptions used were: the average nominal interest rate on public debt is
expected to increase slightly, reaching 6.3 percent in 2017 from 5.4 percent in 2011; GDP growth follows the
assumptions provided in Table 1, increasing to 4 percent by 2015. The main downside risk, given the large stock of
non-RON denominated debt, is nominal depreciation of the exchange rate.


                                                                          10
   shocks. The worst scenario for external debt is associated with a negative primary balance
   shock and results in a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 72.2 percent in 2011 to 68
   percent in 2017, compared with 56.6 percent in the baseline scenario.

33.    The public debt level does        Figure 3: Romania’s Public Debt compared with other
not pose a substantial threat in the     EU Member States
medium-term. The current levels of
public debt stock and service
requirements    are    within    the
thresholds proposed by the EU Fiscal
Compact. At 31.2 percent of GDP in
2010, Romania‟s public debt is well
below the 60 percent ceiling set by
the EU Growth and Stability Pact,
and one of the lowest in the EU
(Figure 3).

34.     The Government intends to improve public debt sustainability by extending the
maturity of its borrowing. Government borrowing from IFIs in 2009-2011 reduced the share of
short-term loans and interest rate obligations. The Government‟s borrowing strategy regarding
capital markets is to issue medium and long-term securities at fixed interest rates, with a view to
lengthening debt maturity and reducing uncertainties on payment obligations. The continuation
of medium-term fiscal and structural reforms under programs supported by IFIs is expected to
send a positive signal to markets, and facilitate the implementation of this borrowing strategy. At
the same time, the foreign exchange and fiscal buffers that are being strengthened with support
from IFIs will help cushion temporary shocks.

35.      Government’s medium term fiscal consolidation effort is gradually reducing
financing requirements. The 2012-2015 sovereign debt obligations stem mainly from the
rollover of past debt, rather than from budget shortfalls. Fiscal deficits have been reduced
sharply, from 7.3 percent of GDP in 2009 to a projected 2.2 percent of GDP in 2012. This trend
is projected to continue under the recently concluded EU Fiscal Compact, and Romania‟s fiscal
deficit is projected to fall under 1 percent of GDP by 2015. Gross public debt financing needs are
starting to decline as of 2013 (Table 3). The 2012 aggregate financing requirements of the
Government are projected at €15.2 billion, of which €12.2 billion to amortize past debt, and €3.0
billion to cover interest payments and the budgetary primary deficit. The DPL-DDO would
contribute to an increase in the fiscal buffer by €1.0 billion. (Table 4). The corresponding
numbers for 2013 are: gross financing requirements of €17.9 billion to cover amortization of
€15.1 billion, and interest payments and the budgetary primary deficit of €2.8 billion. The €1
billion DPL-DDO will remain a part of the fiscal buffer despite not being drawn down and there
will be no further increase in the fiscal buffer in 2013.

36.     The Government plans to secure financing mainly from capital markets, and rely
increasingly on domestic sources. Of the €16.2 billion the Government intends to borrow in
2012, 88 percent (i.e., €14.4 billion) would come from markets. Domestic markets are expected
to supply 71.6 percent of the total financing requirements of the Government in 2012 (Table 4).
In 2013, of the €17.9 billion the Government intends to borrow, 94.4 percent would come from
the markets, and domestic markets are expected to supply 82.7 percent of the total financing
requirements. Domestic banks have shown continued willingness to purchase Treasury issues at
declining yields. A Treasury bond issue with 10 years maturity for USD 1.5 billion was
successfully placed on the U.S. market in early February 2012, at interest rates of slightly under
7 percent, followed by a second bond issue of USD 750 million in early March, at around 6.4
percent. Both issues were substantially oversubscribed. In addition, the ECB liquidity efforts
have contributed to favorable market conditions.
37.     The medium-term fiscal and macroeconomic framework was assessed jointly by the
Bank, the IMF and the EU in April-May 2012, and is considered to be satisfactory for the
purposes of this operation. Fiscal stabilization is central to Romania‟s viable macroeconomic
framework and outlook. The authorities aim to respect the projected fiscal deficit of 2.2 percent
in 2012 and reduce this in the medium-term further in line with the European Fiscal Compact.
The fiscal balance is expected to record a deficit of less than two percent of GDP in 2015, and a
structural deficit of 0.4 percent.




                                                                       12
                                E. ROLE OF AND ACCESS TO THE DPL-DDO

38.    The Government of Romania requested IBRD financing in the form of a €1 billion
DPL-DDO, which will form part of the Government’s fiscal buffer. Given the protracted
economic crisis in Europe and the resulting heightened uncertainty in financial markets,
Romania is building a fiscal buffer equivalent to four months of budget deficit financing and
debt rollover. The fiscal buffer was defined in the Government Public Debt Strategy 2011-2013
and in the Fiscal Budgetary Strategy for 2012-2014, and is in the accordance with Fiscal
Compact Convergence Program for 2013-2015. The fiscal buffer will help protect the economy
against unforeseen shocks outside the Government‟s control that may jeopardize the
implementation of their financing strategy.

39.     The Government does not intend to draw the DPL-DDO unless economic conditions
worsen and this curtails Romania’s access to financial markets. The Bank will assess on a
quarterly basis Romania‟s medium-term macroeconomic framework and the Government‟s
progress in implementing the reform agenda, including the achievement of the outcomes
described in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP). The Bank will formally notify the
Government on a quarterly basis regarding the outcome of the assessment of progress in
implementing the DPL-DDO and Romania‟s continued access to DPL-DDO resources.
Disbursement arrangements are discussed further in section VI-E.

40.     The proposed DPL-DDO will also help Romania raise financing on international
markets under its ongoing Medium-Term Notes (MTN) program. The Government‟s access
to markets and its borrowing terms may be affected by the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. The
Government‟s fiscal stabilization and reform program supported by the proposed DPL-DDO and
the IMF and the EU precautionary arrangements serves to reassure capital markets on Romania‟s
medium-term prospects and secure competitive terms and conditions in general, and for debt
rollover in particular.

41.    The timing of the DPL-DDO is determined by potentially high volatility in
European markets in 2012. For the support program to positively influence the market
response, it must be credible. Credibility would come from an early announcement, a significant
commitment of DPL-DDO resources, and the upfront implementation of the substantive policy
reform program agreed with the IFIs, including the measures agreed under the proposed DPL-
DDO.


      III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

                                            A. REFORM PRIORITIES

42.      Government’s fiscal management and structural reform agenda is articulated in the
National Reform Program (NRP). The NRP is a three-year program that seeks to adapt the
priorities set by the European Lisbon Strategy and its successor, the Europe 2020 Agenda, to
Romania‟s realities. It is updated annually and reviewed by the EU. The current NRP for 2011-
2013 was finalized in April 201117. It incorporates commitments made at the time of EU

                                                      13
accession, the 2009-2012 programs of the governing coalition, and commitments made under the
2009-2011 programs with IFIs. The 2012-2014 NRP, which is currently under preparation, will
update the Government‟s policy reform agenda for the medium term and incorporate new
agreements with IFIs, including actions presented in the LDP for this operation (Annex 1).

43.     Romania’s overarching development objective is to achieve convergence with the
EU in terms of income and living standards. With a GDP per capita at 45 percent of the EU27
average, Romania must close a large gap. The 2011-2013 NRP proposes short to medium-term
priority reforms aimed at prudent macroeconomic management, increased efficiency and
transparency of public administration, and an improved business environment. The NRP
complements these priorities with national targets and measures aimed at employment, research,
development and innovation, climate change and energy, education, and social inclusion/poverty
reduction.

44.     The agenda of the current governing coalition is consistent with the previous
Government’s program for 2009-201218 with respect to fiscal consolidation and the reform
program agreed with IFIs19. The new Government intends to pursue prudent fiscal
management, albeit with greater emphasis on supporting growth, employment, and social equity.
It has also stated its commitment to continue structural reforms, including in the areas of fiscal
consolidation, public financial management, public administration reform, SOE reform, social
dialogue, education, health, social assistance, and justice.

45.        The Government’s program builds on progress made in 2009-2011:

          In May 2011 Romania adopted a new Labor Code that promotes the flexibility of the
           labor market and in particular reduces hiring and firing costs, with a view to enhancing
           competitiveness. The new Code extended the use of fixed term and part-time contracts.
           While it is too early to make an assessment of the impact of the new Code, preliminary
           evidence indicates that the number of temporary contracts increased by 200,000 as of
           end-March 2012.
          The Government embarked in 2011 on a comprehensive reform to improve service
           delivery and the efficiency of resource allocation in pre-university education. The
           National Education Law adopted in 2010 mandates the use of the per-student financing
           formula for future budget laws to provide incentives for the rationalization of the school
           system, and introduces measures to enhance competencies, foster early childhood
           education, and update the assessment and evaluation systems. Significant reforms are
           also undertaken being in higher education, including improvements in the classification
           of universities and a better framework for their management, focusing on performance.
           The focus of the Government‟s agenda is currently on implementing the provisions of the
           new Education Law.
          The Government initiated in 2009 a systemic reform of social assistance, starting with the
           better-targeted Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI), family benefits, and heating
           subsidy programs. Further reforms will aim to consolidate multiple social assistance
           programs and improve their targeting. The implementation of the new Social Assistance
           Framework Law, which was adopted in 2011, will help improve the administration of

       social assistance benefits, curtail error and fraud, and improve efficiency and
       effectiveness.
      The reform of the public pension system since 2010 has improved equity, transparency
       and sustainability. The Government implemented measures to align indexation of
       pensions with accepted international practices, consolidate and align special pensions
       with the general system, and eliminate unwarranted invalidity pensions. These measures
       helped generate budget savings and will help contain the unchecked growth in needed
       budget subsidies.
      Financial sector reforms carried out in 2009-2011 sought to bolster contingency planning
       and improve resilience through strengthened regulation and supervision. They included
       new resolution tools, appropriate funding of the Deposit Guarantee Fund, the introduction
       of the International Financial Standards, stronger prudential regulations, adoption and
       implementation of a Strategic Action Plan for the financial sector, amendments to the
       Insolvency Law, guidelines for mortgage restructuring, and new NBR regulations to
       facilitate implementation of Basel III.

                        B. IMPROVING PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

46.     The Fiscal Compact requires Romania to take measures which ensure that its public
financial management framework meets the binding standards imposed by the Fiscal
Compact. This is by no means an easy task and, over the coming years, the Government needs
to focus on adopting good practices in revenue and expenditure management. The aim will be to
maintain macroeconomic stability, allow a better alignment of the budget formulation and
execution processes with the development priorities of the country and the public policy
framework, and have a more efficient allocation of the public resources. The national fiscal
planning should adopt a multi-year perspective to attain the medium-term objective of the
general government balance, with the limit of a structural deficit up to one percent of the gross
domestic product. The numerical fiscal rules assumed under the medium term fiscal framework
for 2012-2015 should also promote compliance with the EU Fiscal Compact reference values for
deficit and debt.

47.     The Government will continue to deepen the 2009-2011 public financial
management (PFM) agenda. The reforms planned for 2012-2014 will focus on the
implementation of public administration reform, modernization of fiscal policies and
administration, and increased efficiency of public spending for health. Public administration
needs to be streamlined, adapted to the evolving role of the state and the redistribution of
responsibilities between central and local Governments, and made more efficient and
accountable for results. To do this, the Government will build on the new public finance
legislative framework approved for 2009-2011 and the findings and recommendations of FRs.
While significant progress was made during 2009-2011 towards reducing budget deficits, fiscal
sustainability hinges on reforms and measures to enhance tax revenues and absorb EU funds,
ensure transparent and accountable preparation and execution of the state budget, and enhanced
public expenditure efficiency overall, in particular in the health sector.

48.   The implementation of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and the
enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) have strengthened fiscal discipline and
improved resource allocation through:

                                               15
   The adoption of the 2012-2014 Fiscal Strategy in 2011, which confirmed the Government‟s
    commitment to medium-term fiscal stabilization. The strategy includes a three-year
    macroeconomic forecast, presents the Government‟s fiscal policy agenda, and analyzes fiscal
    risks. The Fiscal Strategy is overseen by the Fiscal Council (see below).
   The submission of the 2012-2014 MTEF to the EU as part of the 2012-2014 Fiscal Strategy,
    and as updated under the 2012 budget, translated the Fiscal Strategy into specific expenditure
    targets and criteria.
   The enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) in 2010 imposed binding aggregate
    expenditure ceilings, strict rules on Government enforcement of ceilings, and severe
    penalties for failure to comply. The FRL prohibited increased aggregate expenditures during
    the budget year beyond the MTEF envelope.

49.    The fiscal framework was updated in 2012 to cover the period 2013-2015 and it was
submitted to the EU as part of the 2012 -2015 Convergence Program. The updated fiscal
framework is consistent with the provisions of the EU Fiscal Compact, to which Romania is a
signatory part. The Convergence Program also includes a Government financing plan for 2012-
2015 aligned with the fiscal framework, in a format and content required by the EC.

50.     Institutional, policy, process and capacity weaknesses hamper aggregate fiscal
discipline, the effectiveness of public resources allocation, and the alignment of resources
with strategic priorities. These challenges stem largely from the absence of effective strategic
planning, weaknesses in budget management, weak coordination, monitoring and evaluation
arrangements, and inadequate transparency and accountability in decision-making.

51.     The Government has established the Fiscal Council and made budget information
publicly available to enhance fiscal transparency and accountability. The Fiscal Council was
established in 2010 and endowed with necessary budget resources to operate effectively. The
Council is a consultative independent institution that oversees and assesses public policy
decisions which have fiscal implications, and informs the public. A respected technocrat was
recruited from the private sector to lead it and gradually build its capacity. The Fiscal Council
has been effective in providing an independent forum for discussing fiscal policy choices more
broadly and the analysis of annual budget plans and execution challenges in particular. It has
received wide coverage and respect in the media. Fiscal transparency also benefits from the
publication of the Government‟s annual budget on the Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF)
website. This includes detailed information presented by both economic and functional
classifications. An annex to the budget law provides information on capital expenditure
allocation by project. The Government is also taking steps to prioritize investment projects that
could be financed within the next three to four years.

52.     Romania’s recent fiscal challenges brought renewed attention to raising revenue
administration’s performance, while minimizing collection costs and reducing compliance
costs for taxpayers. The Government unified the collection of tax and social security under a
single organization, the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF), and introduced
taxpayer segmentation. Risk-based audit selection, e-filing and e-payment have also been
launched, but the use of these services remains limited. Overall, major challenges remain, in
particular in improving the performance of the revenue collection system and facilitating
voluntary tax compliance. Despite a nascent economic recovery, tax and social contribution

                                               16
revenues remain, at 27.5 percent of GDP in 2011, the lowest in the EU with the exception of
Latvia, posing substantial risks to meeting the medium-term fiscal targets. An extensive network
of territorial offices contributes to increased tax collection costs draining a large amount of
resources for routine processes while diverting the focus away from core audit and compliance
functions. The compliance burden on taxpayers is also high: the World Bank Paying Taxes 2012
report20 ranks Romania only 154th out of 183 countries with regard to the ease of paying, with
the number of tax payments totaling 113.

53.     Medium-term fiscal sustainability will be enhanced through better tax compliance
and collection of budget revenues, and prudent management of expenditures. The
Government will implement in 2012-2015 policy and institutional measures to enhance tax
collection and manage public expenditures more efficiently, transparently, and with greater
accountability and predictability. The Government plans to:

    Increase revenue collection through the consolidation of local tax offices for small taxpayers
     to one per county by end-2015 (i.e., from over 300 at end-2010 to 47), the management of
     the taxation of 25,000 medium and large taxpayers who contribute over 70 percent of tax
     revenues by a special tax department, the replacement of manual procedures for legal entities
     with electronic tax filing and bank payments to Treasury by end-2014, and the gradual
     introduction of tax e-filing to individual taxpayers.
    Improve the transparency and accountability of budget execution by amending the Public
     Finance Law to include a calendar for budgeting, publishing quarterly and annually budget
     execution reports, and integrating accounting and reporting Treasury systems.
    Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure by gradually introducing
     program budgeting that includes performance indicators.
    Streamline the tax system to foster investment and business, by reducing the number of tax
     payments from 113 in 2011 to about 50 by 201421, and eliminating low-yield taxes that carry
     high administration costs.

      C. STRENGTHENING THE GOVERNANCE OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES IN THE ENERGY
                                                       SECTOR

54.     SOEs’ poor financial performance affects Romania’s fiscal sustainability. The largest
SOEs are in energy, where they represent 53 percent of all energy activity22; transport and
storage (34 percent); and mining and quarrying (27 percent). Despite some moderation during
the pre-crisis period, arrears accumulation remains an endemic phenomenon at the level of the
state-owned or state-controlled enterprises. While the authorities have almost eliminated arrears
of the central government during the past two years, SOE arrears amounted to about 2.9 percent
of GDP at end-2011. The Government has had to use scarce public resources to cover SOE
losses, and compensate their non-payment of contributions to state and social security budgets,
and health and unemployment funds. Arrears accumulation contaminates private companies by

21
   The number of tax payments in 2011 was 29 in Poland, 17 in Bulgaria, 13 in Hungary, and 7 in Czech Republic.
22
   SOEs dominate electricity generation, electricity and gas transmission, and provide about ½ of natural gas
production and about 3/8 of electricity distribution. Former SOEs, now majority private companies following
privatizations during 2003-2005, provide all domestic oil production and retail sales, about ½ of natural gas
production, 5/8 of electricity distribution and all gas distribution.

                                                      17
generalizing the culture of non-payment and by inducing liquidity shortages. In the energy sector
a few companies are modestly profitable (Hidroelectrica, Nuclearelectrica, Romgaz and
transmission system operators Transelectrica and Transgaz) while others register losses (coal
mining, most thermal electricity generators and many district heating companies).

55.     The energy sector is dominated by state-controlled enterprises. The state is the sole
owner of the transmission grids for gas and electricity, all major electricity generators, three out
of eight electricity distributors (Electrica), Romgaz (which accounts for half of the domestic gas
production and all gas storage), and the hard coal (CNH) and lignite mines (SNLO). The state is
also a minority shareholder in Petrom, the most important oil and gas company. The Property
Fund23 has 15-20 percent stakes in all profitable energy SOEs. Majority state-owned electricity
and gas transmission operators Transelectrica and Transgaz have been listed on the Bucharest
Stock Exchange.

56.     Romania’s energy reforms stalled during 2006-2010 as questions about the outcome
of past reforms prompted a debate about the future direction including further
privatization, price liberalization and private sector participation. Romania‟s energy
strategy since the late 1990s had focused on implementing the requirements of the EU‟s energy
acquis. The 2003 Road Map guided the restructuring and liberalization process up to about
2006. Major privatizations were carried out, including the national oil and gas company Petrom,
gas supply and distribution and five of Romania‟s eight electricity supply and distribution
companies. In 2006, planned further privatizations, including the remaining three electricity
supply and distribution companies and three major thermal power companies were suspended
and the debate was focused on the role of the government and privatization. During a period of
rising international oil prices and reduced corporate taxation in Romania (the introduction of a
flat 16 percent tax rate in 2005), the increasingly profitable Petrom became the focus of the
critics of privatization, in spite of its large investment program. The energy debate was
dominated by a series of proposals to consolidate the energy sector into one or two national
energy champions, effectively monopolies, as an alternative to continue liberalization and related
measures to attract private investment and professional management.

57.     As a result, the energy market is not fully liberalized. Half of the electricity and gas
markets are fully regulated - consumers purchase energy at retail prices regulated by ANRE, and
power and gas producers are required to supply at regulated wholesale prices. The energy
regulator ANRE lost its operational and financial independence in 2009, when it was
subordinated to the Prime Minister‟s office, prompted in part by the decision to bring all public
entities under Government‟s control and into the budget. This affected ANRE‟s performance
and credibility, and the Government has recognized that ANRE‟s operational and financial
autonomy needs to be restored. In electricity, about one quarter of the wholesale market
transactions are carried out through transparent, competitive and non-discriminatory trading on


23
   The Property Fund was established in 2005 to compensate owners for properties expropriated during the
communist rule. The Fund‟s portfolio is 80 percent in energy companies. Since 2010, the Fund has been managed by
an independent professional manager (one of the biggest fund managers in the world) and provides a critical
independent check and balance function. The Fund was listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange in 2011 and it will
soon be listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.


                                                      18
the OPCOM Power Exchange24. The remainder consists of directly negotiated bilateral contracts
of state-owned electricity generators, mainly Hidroelectrica, with prices at about 50-60 percent
of market prices at the OPCOM Power Exchange. The regulated wholesale electricity price is
about 20-25 percent below market prices at the OPCOM Power Exchange. In gas there is no
trading platform. The regulated domestic gas producer price is about half of the current
wholesale prices in European gas hubs and about one third of the price of Russian gas imported
into the Romanian market.

58.  The performance of the SOE-dominated energy sector carries significant risks for
Romania’s fiscal stability, energy security, and economic growth. They include:

    Risks for the fiscal stability due to losses of potential revenue and arrears25 stemming from
     setting tariffs and entering into bilateral contracts below market prices and/or lower than
     expected profits due to mismanagement, as well as increased expenditure from the
     consolidated budget to cover SOE losses;
    Risks to energy security and economic growth, due to interruptions of supply, particularly in
     electricity, as critical energy generation facilities become obsolete due to reaching the end of
     their life expectancy and technology advancement, and investments in generation do not keep
     the pace with economic growth; and
    Risks to fair competition, due to distortion of competition in the downstream markets, as
     some companies benefit from below-market priced energy, whereas others have to purchase
     electricity on market prices.

59.     To address these problems and to mitigate the risks, the Government resumed
energy sector reforms in 2011. It initiated measures to improve the governance of energy
SOEs, enhance competition, and attract the private capital needed to secure investment and boost
competitiveness in the sector. The October 2011 decision to cancel the national energy
champions plan opened the way for the Government to: (a) resume energy reforms along the
lines of the 2003 Road Map which had guided Romania‟s accession to the EU in the area of
energy reform; and (b) address ongoing infringements by the European Commission for
Romania‟s failure to implement EU‟s energy acquis. A Law on SOE Governance was processed
and approved as an Emergency Ordinance which signaled the Government‟s determination to
move ahead rapidly. A series of adjustments in gas prices was authorized in 2011, the latest of
which became effective in January 2012.

60.    The Government’s 2012-2014 program includes the following energy sector
objectives and measures:

    Improved governance and contracting practices: (a) the boards of administration of state-
     owned electricity generators Hidroelectrica and Nuclearelectrica, gas SOE Romgaz, power

24
   OPCOM is a subsidiary of Romania‟s electricity transmission system operator Transelectrica. The OPCOM
Power Exchange was developed with assistance from the European Union and the World Bank under the 2003
Electricity Market Project. The Project also helped Transelectrica to establish a balancing market and rehabilitate
transmission substations and ANRE to establish the Commercial Code for the electricity market.
25
   The total arrears of SOEs controlled by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce (around 80 percent of which are
energy & mining, including gas extraction and coal) amounted to around € 3 billion at end-2011, i.e., about 2.3
percent of GDP.

                                                        19
     supplier SOE Electrica Furnizare, and the Oltenia Energy Complex are being reconstituted in
     accordance with the Law on SOE Governance and new professional management will be
     appointed; (b) Hidroelectrica terminated five of its 15 bilateral contracts and a special
     Commission established for this purpose renegotiated the remaining 10 bilateral contracts to
     narrow the gap with market prices at the OPCOM Power Exchange. The Government
     confirmed that the renegotiation of contracts was carried out with due regard to applicable
     legal and contractual rights and obligations as well as due process. The new Government
     that took office in May 2012 scheduled another round of negotiations in view of the EC
     announcement on April 25, 2012 that it will conduct in-depth investigations to assess
     whether Hidroelectrica purchased or sold electricity at preferential tariffs in breach of EU
     state aid rules. Hidroelectrica will post on its web-site key elements of contracts, including
     average price, duration and volume, within 30 days after the conclusion of renegotiations; (c)
     all new bilateral contracts for energy sales will be concluded transparently and competitively
     through OPCOM for electricity and a new gas trading platform. OPCOM will develop the
     policy framework necessary to launch the gas trading platform by January 1, 2013. The
     Government intends to: (i) transfer OPCOM, currently a subsidiary of Transelectrica, directly
     under the Ministry of Economy by the end of 2012; and (ii) in 2013, as soon as the gas
     trading platform26 is operational and the new gas law is enacted, offer for sale the shares of
     OPCOM to electricity and gas market participants and potentially to other European energy
     exchanges with the objective of achieving a wide participation of market participants for
     strong corporate governance and to facilitate EU energy market integration; and (d) in
     preparation for the increasing electricity trade volume, OPCOM will introduce: (i) in 2012
     refinements in its trading platforms and standardized contracts for the centralized auction of
     bilateral contracts to ensure competitive and transparent trading: and (ii) in 2013
     financial/hedging instruments to manage energy price variation risks. Contracting of
     electricity sales by SOEs through the OPCOM Power Exchange and Transelectrica balancing
     market is expected to increase from about one-quarter in 2011 to over 50 percent in 2014 and
     80 percent in 2018. The share of electricity sold by SOEs at market prices would increase at
     a faster pace, from about one-quarter in 2011 to about 75 percent in 2014 and 100 percent in
     2018.
    Legislative and regulatory measures to improve competition, attract private investment and
     align the energy sector with the EU‟s energy acquis: (a) new electricity and gas laws will be
     enacted to transpose the EU‟s Third Package of energy reforms 27. The new electricity law
     has been approved by the Government and is expected to be approved by the Parliament by
     end-June 2012; the gas law is expected to be approved as an emergency ordinance of the
     Government also by end-June 2012; (b) the financial and operational independence of the
     energy regulator ANRE will be restored in accordance with provisions included in the new
     electricity law; (c) the electricity market will be gradually deregulated on the basis of a

26
   Gas Trading Platform covers the logistics, rules and procedures to be approved by ANRE, which define the
technical, operational and commercial modalities for implementation of the new trading regime for natural gas.
27
   The EU adopted the Third Energy Package in July 2009, to make the EU energy market more effective and to
create a single EU gas and electricity market, with the aim to keep prices as low as possible and increase the
standards of service and the security of supply. The package consists of two directives concerning common rules for
the internal market in electricity (2009/72/EC) and gas (2009/73/EC) and three regulations on conditions for access
to the natural gas transmission networks (EC No 715/2009), and the network for cross-border exchange of electricity
(EC No 714/2009), as well as the establishment of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators ACER (EC
No 713/2009).

                                                        20
    roadmap approved by the Government in March 2012, which would phase out regulated
    prices for non-residential consumers between September 2012 and December 2013, and for
    residential consumers between July 2013 and December 2017. The road map for phasing out
    regulated gas prices is being finalized and is expected to be approved by end-June 2012.
    Regulated gas prices for non-households will be increased in a broadly linear fashion starting
    in December 2012 and will converge to average European prices by end-2014. Prices will be
    fully liberalized beginning in January 2015, unless a large gap remains between the average
    European price and the import price (which could endanger market stability), in which case
    adjustment would continue until end-2015. For households, regulated gas prices will be
    increased starting in July 2013 and converge to international gas prices no later than
    December 2018; and (d) ANRE will prepare during 2012 and implement from January 1,
    2013 a new regulatory framework for electricity and gas distribution and supply for the 2013-
    2017 period which will enable Romania to reach cost-recovery prices.
   Improved heating services and containment of the cost of heating for households: (a) timely
    and full payment of heating subsidies by municipalities through strict implementation of the
    Emergency Ordinance 69/2011; (b) the preparation and implementation of projects to
    improve energy efficiency and heating services, including in district heating systems, homes
    and others buildings, to contain the impact of gas price increases on gas and district heating
    consumers; and (c) mitigation of the impact of energy price increases on vulnerable
    customers.
   Increased private sector participation in the financing and management of the energy
    sector: (a) the secondary public offering (SPO) of 10 percent of the Government‟s shares in
    Transelectrica on the Bucharest Stock Exchange was concluded in March 2012 and will be
    followed by an SPO of 15 percent of Transgaz shares by end-June 2012; (b) initial public
    offerings of shares of Romgaz (September), Hidroelectrica (October) and Nuclearelectrica
    (end-2012) on the Bucharest Stock Exchange, following the reconstitution of their boards,
    the renegotiation of Hidroelectrica‟s bilateral contracts and approval of road maps for the
    phasing out of regulated electricity and gas prices as discussed above; and (c) majority
    privatization of the Oltenia Energy Complex, Elcen Bucuresti and Electrica (including
    electricity supply company Electrica Furnizare and Electrica‟s three distribution companies),
    all in 2013. Ahead of the Electrica sale, Electrica‟s remaining shares in the already
    privatized electricity distribution companies will also be offered for sale. The Property Fund
    is a minority shareholder in all of these energy SOEs and is closely involved in monitoring
    these contracting, listing and privatization processes as they are being implemented.
   Updated package of tax, legal and regulatory measures for the oil and gas sector,
    prepared in consultation with the industry, and taking into account the liberalization of
    domestic gas producer prices. The package will cover two parts: (a) a windfall levy to
    capture a part of the extraordinary revenue to firms resulting from the liberalization of gas
    prices, as specified in the gas roadmap. Funds raised will help finance measures to protect
    vulnerable consumers from the impact of price adjustments; and (b) a broader package
    specifying Romania‟s oil and gas regulatory and taxation regime for the period 2015-2024, to
    be prepared, with professional advice, by end-2012.

61.     These plans are ambitious, matching the 2003 Road Map both in its liberalization and
privatization dimensions. The implementation will thus be a major challenge. Proposed reforms
will affect vested interests that have enjoyed the benefits of below market prices as well as the
population at large as regulated prices are phased out. The poverty and social impact of these

                                               21
reforms are expected to mitigated by Government efforts to put in place well designed targeted
programs to protect vulnerable consumers by phasing increases in energy tariffs for residential
consumers over the 2013-2017 period and by implementing compensatory measures for
vulnerable households (see the PSIA section).


      D. IMPROVING THE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES

62.     Romania currently spends less on health care services than any other European
country and its spending is both inefficient and inequitable. Romania spends less than 4
percent of GDP on health compared with a European average of 6.5 percent and an EU average
of 8.7 percent. In addition, access to healthcare in Romania is highly skewed towards wealthier
groups. Almost half of the poor do not seek care when required compared with around 20
percent of those in the top income quintile. Recent gains in access have been almost entirely
among wealthier households with 81 percent of those in the top quintile having access compared
with 52 percent of the poor.

63.      Of the scarce public funds allocated for healthcare, much is wasted on inefficient
and unnecessary services or treatments. Patients are routinely admitted to a hospital even
when unnecessary; branded drugs are used when generics are equally effective and available;
and expensive drugs are used for purposes other than those recommended. These practices are
both financially costly and potentially risky from a medical standpoint. A new demographic
profile (longer life expectancy, greater proportion of elderly people (especially among women)),
a new epidemiological profile (higher rates of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and co-
morbidities), and the availability of new and less invasive technologies indicate the need to: (i)
reduce in-patients services and beds for acute diseases; increase the supply of specialized
ambulatory and day care services (these could function within hospitals, as satellite clinics, or
independent facilities); and (iii) provide long-term care in more appropriate and less expensive
institutions than hospitals, such as nursing homes and social care.

64.     The current health system is heavily biased towards inpatient hospital care. The
legacy from the communist period included a large number of hospitals and hospital beds
operating in a fragmented structure and with insufficient development of different levels of care.
Romania has a high inpatient admission rate. While the government‟s stated policy during the
last decade has been to reduce its reliance on hospital services and increase the use of primary
care doctors and outpatient services, little progress has been achieved to date in making this
change. While the number of hospital acute beds has been reduced, Romania still has more than
five acute beds per 1,000 population compared with four per 1,000 population in the EU.

65.    The lack of an appropriate Health Technology Assessment 28 (HTA) for new drugs
and medical devices has resulted in a health system also biased to the use of high cost
technology. Most national health programs in Romania consist of high-cost, low-frequency
conditions and treatments. These programs are financed by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the
National Health Insurance House (NHIH) and receive special treatment. Not only are they given

28
  A health technology assessment provides evidence on the clinical effectiveness and the costs and benefits (long
and short term) of new technology in the clinical practice.

                                                        22
a high budget priority but also they were exempted from cuts during the financial crunch of
2009. They are also exempt from rules requiring co-payment by users and they tend to involve
new high-cost technologies without a proper health technology assessment. The current list of
compensated drugs needs to be updated using the results of a rapid assessment completed in
January 2012. In addition, an appropriate HTA process needs to be in place for recurrent updates
and evaluations.

66.     The Government’s 2012-2015 program supports health sector reforms aimed at
mobilizing resources and improving the efficiency, quality and equity of services. Medium-
term reforms continue the agenda of 2009-2011 supported by the DPL program that aimed to
contain rising costs and improve the quality of services delivered. The Government will curtail
costly in-patient services and promote cost-effective outpatient and primary care services,
rationalize hospital infrastructure, and streamline the introduction of new drugs and technologies
and the basic benefit package reimbursed by the public health insurance system.

   In 2009-2011 the Government implemented cost-saving regulations governing drug pricing
    and the promotion of generic drugs in framework contracts concluded by the National Health
    Insurance House (CNAS) with service suppliers; enacted legislation to introduce co-
    payments (including exemptions for the poor); and initiated the rationalization of the hospital
    network. This implied, inter alia, the closure of 64 hospitals (out of the existing 474
    hospitals), which were converted into long-term care institutions, as well as the introduction
    a new classification of hospitals to underpin their future financing. Many “hospitals? are de
    facto long term care facilities. They will not be closed, but the services they provide will be
    financed through more appropriate mechanisms rather than expensive hospital care, as part of
    the social assistance services network. The Government also launched the hospital
    accreditation process, which is expected to be completed by end 2015. Further, the
    Government introduced in 2012 a “claw-back? tax applicable to the producers of
    pharmaceutical products to mobilize further resources for the health sector and settle the
    arrears accrued for the compensated drugs.

   In 2012-2014 the Government plans to:
         i. update the basic benefit package by revising the current list of compensated drugs,
            removing from the basic package all medicines subsidized for indications outside the
            terms of their marketing approval, or for which there is no medical scientific
            evidence supporting the indication of such drugs in certain medical treatments, as
            identified in the final National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
            report. Potential savings estimated at Euro 100 million by 2015 as a result of the
            revision of the basic package of health services will be reallocated to other health
            priority areas, mainly to health prevention and promotion programs. These programs
            will receive at least 10 percent of the MoH budget for National Health Programs in
            2013 and at least 15 percent in 2015;
        ii. create the institutional framework for implementing a HTA procedure as a condition
            to include new drugs and new indications to the list. This new HTA mechanism will
            support the update of the basic package using the best available medical evidence;
            and



                                                23
      iii. continue the implementation of the National Hospital Rationalization Strategy to
           reduce the number of hospital beds from 129,524 at end-2011 to 123,127 in 2013, on
           the basis of a National Hospital Master Bed Plan approved in April 2011.


                             E. CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION

67.    Romania’s Constitution guarantees public information and consultation on the
Government’s legislative initiatives, by mandating parliamentary debate and approval.
Legislative policy initiatives must be posted on the internet for 30 days for consultations and
feedback, with a background note justifying the initiatives and discussing their expected social
and economic impact. While policies introduced through emergency ordinances are exempt, such
ordinances must be endorsed by the Parliament upon effectiveness, and must thus comply with
public consultation requirements. The Government must carry out public consultations for
important decisions.

68.     The Government regularly consults with stakeholders during the preparation of the
National Reform Program (NRP). During the annual process of updating the NRP, the
Government conducts consultations with the political opposition and the main stakeholders on
the policy priorities of the country and the way they are proposed to be reflected in the
document. These consultations would, however, benefit from a more systematized framework for
the discussion and a broader advanced public dissemination of the main themes proposed by the
NRP and the way they relate to other strategic documents of the Government, such as the
Convergence Program and the Fiscal Strategy.

69.     The Government has been only partially effective in consulting the Parliament and
other stakeholders on reform measures, although it has acted in a transparent fashion, in
particular with regard to the DPL-DDO agenda. Occasional differences in opinion and a
breakdown in communications between the ruling coalition and the opposition have diluted
constructive dialogue in the Parliament. Dialogue has sometimes been hampered by the tight
schedule for the reform agenda implemented by Government during the crisis. Government
measures and actions were taken in a reasonably transparent fashion. However, there was often
insufficient time to carry out extensive consultations and achieve consensus with all relevant
stakeholders, especially in cases when the Government had to resort to Emergency Ordinances.

70.     The Bank has promoted maximum transparency during the preparation of the
DPL-DDO and systematic consultation of stakeholders on proposed reforms. The same
approach will continue during implementation. During the preparation of the DPL-DDO the
Bank consulted, alone and jointly with the IMF and the EC, the Parliament and the political
opposition (which formed the new Romanian Government in May 2012), the private sector and
other stakeholders on the proposed reform agenda, and took into account their feedback.

71.    Proposed energy reforms have been debated in conferences, workshops, and the
media since 2006. The implementation of the 2003 energy strategy (the Road Map) stalled in
2006. Following extensive consultations (characterized as best practice by the Bank at the time),
a new energy strategy was finalized in the summer 2007 for Government approval in September
2007. At the Cabinet review of the final draft, a proposal to establish an energy holding
company was superimposed on the proposed strategy. It triggered a multi-year debate that was

                                               24
finally brought to an end in October 2011 with the widely-welcomed formal decision at the
highest political level by Romania‟s Strategic Defense Council to cancel the energy champions
plan. The energy regulator ANRE carries out consultations on its regulatory decisions, including
the use of its web-site for posting drafts for public feedback. Media follows energy sector
developments closely. The Bank‟s functional review of the Ministry of Economy, the energy
sector and business environment is available on a popular news website and has contributed to
the public debate. Hidroelectrica‟s below market price bilateral contracts have drawn sustained
attention, and actions supported by the DPL-DDO are widely acclaimed by most stakeholders.

72.     The Government’s medium-term reform program in health has been widely
discussed in the media, the Parliament and health forums in Romania. The reform measures
to improve the efficiency of health expenditures were articulated and adopted by the Romanian
authorities following extensive consultations with stakeholders during the implementation of the
DPL1-3 program in 2009-2011, in the context of preparing the Health Sector Functional Review,
and under the preparation of the DPL-DDO. The MoH has published on its webpage the planned
changes in the basic health benefits package to facilitate open discussion and feedback.

73.    The DPL-DDO program will help increase transparency of Government policies
and offer a venue for consultation of other stakeholders. The policy reform agenda agreed
with the Government, as expressed in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP), emphasizes
governance transparency. The Government will enhance the transparency of budget preparation
and execution; make available to the public its agenda for legal and policy proposals; associate
independent institutions (e.g., Fiscal Council) and private sector representatives to the review of
fiscal policies; open SOEs‟ activities to public scrutiny; and disclose tenders for public
procurement and contract awards.



             IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

                         A. LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

74.     The proposed DPL-DDO program is consistent with the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for Romania. The main objective of the 2009-13 Country Strategy is to deepen
the reform agenda for improved public sector management, economic growth and
competitiveness, and social and spatial cohesion. The focus of this DPL-DDO program on
public financial management, governance of SOEs in the energy sector, and health sector
reforms is consistent with these objectives. The DPL-DDO program takes also into account the
added focus of the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR)29 on the European perspective: (i) policy
reforms to reap the benefits of EU membership and meet the objectives of the Europe 2020
strategy; (ii) modernization of public institutions to enhance resource allocation and absorption
of EU funds; and (iii) complement to EU funding. The proposed operation would support
compliance with the EU energy policy in the context of SOE governance measures. In light of
the severity and deepening of the crisis in the EU, the proposed operation would commit about
80 percent of the additional USD 1.66 billion proposed by the CPSPR in new lending over

FY12-13. The Bank‟s portfolio has also changed over the years in Romania. For instance, the
share of policy-based lending increased from 10 percent in FY05-08 to 73 percent in FY10-12.

75.      The proposed DPL-DDO builds on the successful implementation of the 2009-2011
macroeconomic stabilization and reform program supported by IFIs. Romania‟s 2009-2011
crisis management and reform program was supported by a multilateral financial package agreed
by Romania in 2009 with the IMF, EU, WB, EIB and EBRD, which committed almost €20
billion in balance of payments, budget support, and private sector support. The financial package
was aimed primarily at macroeconomic stabilization, but also supported significant reforms in
public financial management, public administration, social assistance, public pension system,
education, health, and the financial sector. The IMF and EU considered that the program was
implemented in a satisfactory manner, and fully disbursed the agreed commitments of about €18
billion (with the exception of the last tranche of the IMF Stand-by, which was converted into a
precautionary tranche). The Bank contributed €1 billion to the package through the DPL series
that is also fully disbursed. Quarterly supervision was carried out jointly with the IMF and EU.

76.     The IMF and the EU have currently in place precautionary arrangements. These
arrangements continue the support to macroeconomic stabilization and financial sector
resilience, and include pro-growth and pro-equity policies. The IMF arrangement of €3.4 billion
supports fiscal reforms in health, improved management of capital spending, the settlement of
Government arrears, and tax administration and simplification30. It also supports structural
reforms in the SOE sector (especially in energy31 and transport), regulatory effectiveness, and
liberalization of administered prices. The EU arrangement for €1.4 billion supports further fiscal
consolidation, improved fiscal governance and reform, financial sector regulation and
supervision, and structural reforms in energy, labor market and business environment.

77.     The Bank reform agenda is complementary to that of the IMF and the EU, but with
a distinct focus. All three IFIs support increased revenue collection, improved public
expenditure efficiency and improved public financial management, but each institution focuses
on distinct aspects. The IMF focuses on fiscal policies, tax system efficiency and the reduction of
all SOE arrears; the EU highlights the management of EU structural funds and compliance with
EU directives; and the Bank stresses the reform of tax administration, and the implementation of
commitments to achieve the EU Fiscal Compact targets. In the area of energy sector reform the
IMF precautionary arrangement pursues some of the same reforms supported by the DPL-DDO,
the in-depth technical knowledge and support is provided by the Bank, while the EU focuses on
the transposition of the EU Third Energy Package. In the health sector, the IMF is mostly
concerned about budgeted expenditure, the Bank pursues the rationalization of the public health
system and the reallocation of savings to primary care, while the EU has no conditions in this
sector. At the same time, the IMF and EU pursue additional reform objectives: the IMF supports
reforms in the financial and banking sector, the reduction of general government arrears, and the
privatization process of key SOEs in energy, transport and mining; while the EU supports


30
  The IMF arrangement supports the simplification and administration of the tax system.
31
  Energy was not included in the earlier DPL series. However, the Bank worked closely with the IMF on the energy
component of the IMF program. The energy component of the current IMF program and the proposed DPL DDO
are closely aligned, except for actions in the Government‟s LDP for the DPL-DDO that go beyond the term of the
IMF program.

                                                      26
financial sector regulation and supervision, monitors labor market institutions and
the enforcement of EU directives for competitive functioning of markets.32

                            B. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

78.    The proposed DPL-DDO deepens the reform agenda supported by previous policy-
based Bank lending to Romania. In 2003-06 a Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL)
supported Romania‟s EU accession and integration by helping undertake reforms in public
finance management, education, health, social assistance, pensions, judiciary, and private sector
development. Following the successful implementation of PAL1 (rated highly satisfactory by the
Bank‟s Quality Assurance Group--QAG), the subsequent PALs were canceled at the
Government‟s request, as reform fatigue set in after accession in 2007. The 2009-2011 DPL
programs helped meet Romania‟s exceptional budget support needs during the first phase of the
economic and financial crisis, and fostered structural reforms in public administration, budget
management, pension system, education, health, social insurance and the financial sector.

79.     The 2009-2011 DPL series complemented IMF and the EU programs to support
Romania’s macroeconomic stabilization and financial sector viability, and led to important
Government actions. Among others, the Government: (i) implemented a performance-based
unitary pay system for public administration to ensure fair and comparable pay scales across the
public service; (ii) implemented a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to guide
strategic allocation of budget resources and improve the predictability and transparency of
budget execution; (iii) reallocated social assistance funding towards well-targeted programs to
improve the efficiency of the social protection system; (iv) introduced a comprehensive reform
of public pension system to improve its fiscal sustainability; (v) introduced per-student
financing; and (vi) took steps to rationalize health expenditure for drugs and hospital services,
introduce co-payments, and increase health sector revenues from earmarked excise taxes (see
table 5) to improve the quality of healthcare and increase the efficiency of health expenditure.33

80.    The Executive Directors approved a results-based Social Assistance System
Modernization (SASM) Project in May 2011. This project supports the reform strategy of the
Government addressing the social assistance system regulatory framework, the management of
information, payment arrangements, and the control of error, fraud and corruption. The project
focuses on the Government‟s programs for low-income households, the disabled, and families
with children.34 The SASM complements the DPL-DDO by validating the feasibility and
applicability of broader PFM reforms for the social assistance sector, and by providing the
Government with a more viable framework for reallocation of budget savings generated by PFM
and energy SOEs reforms to mitigate the poverty impact of reforms supported by the IFIs,
including the DPL-DDO.

81.    The Government has requested World Bank assistance for health sector reform,
implementation of the Functional Review recommendations, conducting of additional
Functional Reviews, and capacity-building in strategic planning, public finance
management, and absorption of EU funds. Although some of these requests do not directly
address specific DPL-DDO reform measures, they are relevant to the broader context of the
Government‟s fiscal stabilization and reform program. For example, public administration, tax


                                                        28
administration and health sector reforms are intimately linked to the DPL-DDO agenda. The
Progress Report on the CPS endorsed these requests and the Bank is on track in delivering these.

                                              C. LESSONS LEARNED

82.    The DPL-DDO is guided by the lessons from the implementation of the 2009-2011
DPL program and the 2012 IEG study on the World Bank Group response to the global
financial crisis35, as well as by lessons derived from the implementation of the Bank
portfolio in Romania. The main lessons call for the following:
      Focusing on Bank‟s comparative advantage acquired through programmatic and investment
       lending in Romania and elsewhere, as well as through analytical work.
      Coordinating closely with other IFIs in the design and monitoring of reforms to ensure
       lasting results.
      Agreeing upfront with the Government on detailed reform implementation schedules and
       monitorable outcomes.
      Mitigating the impact of political transitions and enhancing sustainability through broader
       political and civil society support for reforms.
      Taking into account political and social constraints, the limited capacity of the Government
       to design and implement coherent policies, and the weak capacity of the Parliament to review
       and adopt necessary legislation, in the design and sequencing of the program.
      Accompanying budget support with technical assistance to address implementation issues
       together with policy issues.
      Direct involvement and support from the Prime Minister‟s office and Presidency are crucial
       for successful implementation of reforms, especially when politically sensitive.

                                        D. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

83.     The DPL-DDO is anchored in past and ongoing analytical work and technical
assistance. The World Bank‟s recent analytical work contains public financial management
analysis of all major sectors and has been effective in supporting the fiscal sustainability targets
in the Government‟s 2009-2012 program as well as fiscal reforms that are critical to the medium-
term agenda. The 2009 Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR) examined
opportunities for efficiency gains in main expenditure areas of the public budget and analyzed
aggregate and sector expenditure patterns, effectiveness and efficiency of spending, and policy
and institutional challenges faced by the Government. In addition, technical notes were prepared
in 2009-2010 to help the Government with public sector pay reform, medium-term budgeting
and the pension system. Ongoing work that helped underpin the DPL-DDO includes: (i) 2011-
2012 Policy Notes on sources of growth, private sector development, mobilization of EU funds
for infrastructure, SOEs, FDI, and the business environment, which are all relevant for the
energy sector reform; (ii) social policy monitoring and analytical work carried out during the
preparation of the SASM, both of which have been useful in setting up a baseline to monitor the
impact of energy price changes; and (iii) analytical work carried out during the preparation of the
health reform projects (see Table 6 for details).

84.      Many of the Functional Reviews (FRs) carried out for the Government of Romania
over 2010-2011 are relevant for the DPL-DDO. The FRs analyzed the functioning of
institutions which govern a number of areas of the Romanian economy. Of particular relevance
to this operation are those related to: public finance; economy, energy and business environment;
health; the business environment; and labor and social protection. The FRs provide operational
recommendations on strategic management, organizational structure, sector governance,
budgeting, and human resource management within these areas.

                           V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                      A. OPERATION CONTEXT

85.     The proposed operation extends the reform agenda supported by the 2009-2011
DPL series and complements the IMF and the EU precautionary arrangements. The DPL-
DDO will expand and deepen the DPL-supported reforms in the areas of public financial
management and public health, and support the Government’s reform agenda in SOE
governance in the energy sector. In synergy with the precautionary programs with the IMF and
the EU, the DPL-DDO will help the Government accelerate progress towards fiscal sustainability
through: (i) improved public financial management to enhance the quality and efficiency of
public spending, and the Government‟s revenue-raising capacity through better enforcement of
tax laws; (ii) improved management of SOEs in the energy sector to generate savings and attract
the private capital needed to modernize plants and increase their competitiveness; and (iii)
improved quality and efficiency of public health spending through the reduction of unjustified
outlays and reallocation of resources to high-return preventive care and health promotion
programs. In addition, the DPL-DDO contributes to the Government‟s fiscal buffer, but without
requiring actual disbursement of funds.


                                                  30
86.     Reforms in these three areas remain incomplete and each area is essential to fiscal
sustainability and the broader objective of EU convergence, where the Bank is well-placed
to support structural reforms. Public financial management is affected by low tax payment
compliance, inefficient and non-transparent expenditure practices, and high administration costs.
In the energy sector, improper contracting practices and subsidized prices drain scarce public
resources, hamper energy efficiency, and create opportunities for rent-seeking. Without reform,
the energy sector will become a drag on growth. In the health sector, scarce public resources are
wasted on treatments with unproven medical benefits despite the fact that nearly half of the poor
do not have adequate health coverage. The chronic deficit of the public health insurance system
drains budget resources and complicates fiscal planning. A reallocation of spending within this
sector is vital to increase the quality of and the access to healthcare.

                                          B. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

87.   The Government has agreed to implement a comprehensive three-year reform
program under the DPL-DDO. The DPL-DDO supports that three-year reform program36 that
embodies the authorities‟ commitment to further Romania‟s European integration and accelerate
EU convergence (see Table 7 below, LDP in Annex 1 and Policy Matrix in Annex 2).

                    declarations available for e-filing, pursuant to the
                    Government‟s Memorandum dated April 18, 2012.
                    The Borrower has enacted the 2012 Budget Law to
                    strengthen fiscal discipline and demonstrate
                    commitment to fiscal consolidation in line with the
                    2012-2014 Fiscal Strategy.
                    The Borrower‟s Government has approved and
                    submitted to the European Commission the
                    Convergence Program for 2012-2015 which

36
  It is estimated that the Government can generate at least € 1 billion over the medium term through implementing
the DPL-DDO prior actions. Revenue mobilization improvement can generate at least €500 million (around 0.5
percent of GDP), while energy and health reforms can generate total savings of at least €500 million.

Public Financial Management

88.     The reforms proposed to be supported under the DPL-DDO will help improve tax
compliance, increase tax revenues and reduce administrative costs. The reforms will advance
the modernization and consolidation of tax administration. The scope for increased revenue
collection is significant. The 2011 Activity Report of the Fiscal Council highlighted Romania‟s
low tax compliance (VAT, social contributions, excise taxes) compared with other EU Member
States. Implicit tax rates for personal and corporate income tax are about one third of their legal
rates, suggesting large potential gains from improved tax collection efficiency. International
experience shows that tax administration reforms to consolidate tax collection and rely on
electronic tax filing and bank payment of taxes can significantly improve collection and reduce
administrative costs and corruption. For example, Bulgaria increased budget revenue collection
by 6 percent of GDP through such a program, while at the same time reduced significantly
statutory tax levels for the main taxes.

89.     The proposed reforms will help Romania meet the strict fiscal targets set by the EU
Fiscal Compact. In 2011, the fiscal deficit was under its target of 4.4 percent of GDP and the
Government aims to reduce this further over the medium term. Under the Fiscal Compact the
Government must prepare and approve a three-year fiscal framework and submit it to the EU.
The fiscal framework must validate Romania‟s compliance with the objectives of the revised
Stability and Growth Pact, including an upper limit of 1 percent of GDP at market prices for the
structural fiscal deficit and of 3 percent of GDP for the overall budget deficit. In addition,
Romania is building a fiscal buffer equivalent to €4 billion, (equivalent to four months of budget
financing), which was defined in the Government Public Debt Strategy 2011-2013 and in the
Fiscal Budgetary Strategy for 2012-2014, and is in accordance with the Fiscal Compact
Convergence Program for 2013-2015. The DPL-DDO would be counted as part of the fiscal
buffer. The Government will tap the fiscal buffer if external risks materialize and this
compromises its financing strategy.

90.       DPL-DDO prior actions in the area of public financial management are:

         The Borrower‟s Government has launched the modernization of tax administration by (a)
          reducing the number of local tax offices for small tax payers to no more than 221 (i.e., by
          at least 39 percent) on the basis of Government Decision No. 564/2011 and ANAF
          President Order No 2180/ 2011 as amended; (b) expanding electronic tax filing by all
          legal entities to at least 80 percent on the basis of the Minister of Economy and Finance
          Order No. 858/2008 as amended, the ANAF President‟s Order No. 2520/2010 and the
          Government‟s Emergency Ordinance No. 117/2010 for the tax declarations available for
          e-filing; (c) approving the ANAF restructuring plan for 2012-2014 to further reduce the
          number of local tax offices for small tax payers to 47 and expand electronic tax filing for
          legal entities to 96 percent for tax declarations available for e-filing, pursuant to the
          Government‟s Memorandum dated April 18, 2012.




                                                  33
        The Borrower has enacted the 2012 Budget Law to strengthen fiscal discipline and
         demonstrate commitment to fiscal consolidation in line with the 2012-2014 Fiscal
         Strategy.

        The Borrower‟s Government has approved and submitted to the European Commission
         the Convergence Program for 2012-2015 which incorporates: (a) a medium-term fiscal
         framework consistent with the provisions of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and
         Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (the Fiscal Compact), and (b) a
         financing plan consistent with the above referenced fiscal framework.


Governance of State-Owned Enterprises in the Energy Sector

91.     Improved governance of the state-owned energy generation companies could
generate substantial savings. The termination or renegotiation of bilateral contracts, the
subsequent use of OPCOM Power Exchange and a new gas trading platform for contracting, and
price deregulation could increase significantly the revenues of energy SOEs and their
contribution to the budget. For example, losses to Hidroelectrica and its shareholders stemming
from the below market price bilateral contracts were estimated at €242-326 million per year37
before the recent process of termination and renegotiation of these contracts. International
experience suggests that Romania could achieve fiscal savings of 0.5-1.0 percent of GDP per
annum through energy efficiency measures and the better targeting of compensatory „energy
benefits‟ to low-income households. The analysis undertaken by the Bank on district heating
subsidies and benefits showed that reforms resulted in savings of 0.2 percent of GDP at the local
level alone.

92.     Energy sector reforms will improve the functioning of the energy markets and
promote investment and energy efficiency. The transposition and implementation of the EU‟s
Third Package of Energy Reforms provides for: (a) effective unbundling of energy production
and supply interests from the networks; (b) increased transparency rules including retail markets
and strengthening of consumer protection; and (c) more effective regulatory oversight by
restoring the operational and financial autonomy of Romania‟s energy regulator ANRE. The
energy consumed to produce one unit of GDP is currently around three times higher in Romania
than the EU average. Price deregulation will encourage private investment, including FDI, help
modernize plants and increase energy efficiency, and foster investment in alternative energy
generation.

93.     The energy sector has the potential to become an engine of economic growth in
Romania. As is the case for all productive investments, energy investments contribute to
economic growth and employment. The role of energy investment is particularly central, as
without adequate energy investment Romania‟s energy security is at risk and energy supply
threatens to constrain economic activity. The level of energy investment in the past decade has

37
  € 242 million using the 2006-2011 weighted average price of about € 46.4/MWh at the OPCOM Power Exchange
(which accounted for about 25 percent of Romania‟s electricity supply during that period) and € 326 million using
the 2011 weighted average price of about € 52.1/MWh at OPCOM‟s day-ahead market (one of the trading platforms
at the OPCOM Power Exchange). In 2011 prices in most European day-ahead markets ranged from about €
47/MWh to about € 57/MWh.

                                                       34
been less than half of estimated requirements. Investment requirements in the energy sector are
conservatively estimated at about €30-35 billion in the next 10 years, of which more than half in
power generation. Investments have already been made in areas where privatizations were
carried out. The Foreign Investors Council in Romania estimates energy investments at about
€16 billion in the 2002-2011 period.38 Through the governance improvements, legal and
regulatory measures and market liberalization in the electricity and gas sectors, the Government
intends to attract private investors, especially in electricity generation ( by listing of
Hidroelectrica and Nuclearelectrica, through the privatization of the Oltenia Energy Complex
and Elcen Bucuresti, and by attracting investment in new generation projects) and gas
exploration and production. Romania‟s endowment of energy resources is significant and
diversified, including hydro and other renewable sources, lignite, natural gas, and even uranium
to fuel its nuclear power industry. Romania has the potential to satisfy its own needs and to
become a major exporter of electricity into the regional and European electricity markets.

94.       DPL-DDO prior actions in the area of energy SOEs governance are:
         The Borrower‟s government has approved a memorandum No. DPES 172 dated March
          8, 2012 to carry out Hidroelectrica‟s electricity sales through competitive market
          processes and to publish information on all bilateral contracts for electricity sales.

         The Borrower‟s government has approved and submitted to the Borrower‟s parliament a
          new Electricity Law that transposes the EU Third Package of Energy Reforms and sets
          forth the operational and financial autonomy of the energy regulator ANRE.

         The Borrower‟s Government has approved a roadmap for phasing out regulated prices for
          electricity, pursuant to the Government‟s Memorandum dated March 16, 2012.

Health Sector

95.     The proposed DPL-DDO supports efficiency gains in the health sector. Under the
DPL series the Government implemented reforms to contain the rise in the cost of
pharmaceuticals, introduced co-payments (exempting the poor) and electronic prescription
management, and legislated restructuring and rationalization of the hospital system. The DPL-
DDO will support Government measures to manage more efficiently scarce resources by
rationalizing the use of drugs, treatments, technology, and hospital facilities, and by reallocating
savings to preventive care and health promotion programs.




38
   The main petroleum production and distribution company Petrom, privatized in 2004, more than doubled its
annual investments by 2006 and invested an average over €1 billion per annum during 2006-2011. Its contributions
to the state budget in dividends and various taxes have been even higher. The growth in annual investments in
electricity distribution following privatizations in 2005 has been significant and also the seller of distribution
companies, Electrica, increased its investments in its three companies (Transylvania Nord and Sud and Muntenia
Nord) using the privatization proceeds from 2005. The Government received half of Electrica‟s privatization
proceeds and an additional “donation? in 2010. Wind power has been the third area of increasing energy
investment.

96.       DPL-DDO prior actions in the area of public health are:

         The Borrower has approved under the Government‟s Decision No 359 dated April 18,
          2012 the exclusion of selected drugs compensated for indications outside the terms of
          their marketing approval or for which there is no scientific medical evidence supporting
          their indication, from the lists of compensated drugs and has issued an MoH Order No
          423 dated April 26, 2012 and NHIH Order No. 118 dated April 27, 2012 setting forth the
          conditions under which drugs in the basic health package services can be reimbursed.

         NHIH has implemented the 2012 National Hospital Master Bed Plan approved by the
          Borrower‟s Government Decision No. 151/2011.

         The Borrower‟s Government has established the institutional framework for the
          implementation of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) pursuant to the Borrower‟s
          Government Decision No 351/2012.


                           VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                   A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

97.     Poverty is monitored by the Government and the data are validated by the Bank.
The Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection (MoLFSP) and the National Institute for
Statistics (INS) calculate and monitor poverty figures based on a methodology developed
together with the World Bank. The Bank validated in 2008, 2009 and 2010 the poverty figures
produced by these institutions on the basis of Household Budget Surveys (HBS). The
distributional impact of reform measures is monitored annually based on the HBS data and
administrative data provided by MoLFSP.

98.     The poverty and social impact of the reforms supported by the DPL-DDO is
expected to be overall beneficial and occasional negative effects will be mitigated by
Government actions. Some reforms are expected to have short-term positive consequences,
particularly related to improvements in the quality of healthcare services. Indirect benefits
resulting from improved fiscal management and increased fiscal space for the reallocation of
resources towards growth-supporting and poverty alleviating measures are also expected to have
a beneficial impact in the medium to long term.

99.    The public financial management reforms are expected to have beneficial poverty
and social impacts:

     Strengthened revenue collection will generate additional resources for critical public
      services, such as education, health, social assistance, as well as for the financing of physical
      infrastructure necessary for businesses. As these revenue efforts will also be focused on
      wealthier groups, the impact in terms of equity will also be beneficial.
     Improved fiscal management and efficiency measures will enhance the delivery of public
      goods and services with benefits for citizens at all income levels.

                                                  36
100. The actions to phase out administrative prices in energy will have mixed poverty
and social impacts. The Government will mitigate negative impacts on households by
phasing increases in energy tariffs for residential consumers over the 2013-2017 period and
by implementing compensatory measures for vulnerable households:
    Recent region-wide analysis by the World Bank39 finds that, unlike in most of the region,
     poorer households in Romania spend a lower proportion of their income on energy than
     wealthier ones. Nonetheless, according to the study, increasing energy prices to the level of
     full cost-recovery would have a negative impact on poorer households and could result in up
     to 11 percent40 increase in fuel poverty without mitigating measures targeted towards the
     poor.
    Romania has ample experience and
     expertise in mitigating the negative impact Figure 4: Producer subsidies for heating are

     elimination of the electricity subsidy will be
     accompanied by compensatory measures
     targeting poorer households, as indicated in the Government‟s electricity road map.
    Romania has a number of well-targeted and cost-efficient social assistance programs that can
     be used to compensate the poor for welfare losses associated with the gradual phasing out of
     the regulated electricity and gas prices. Starting 2013, the Government intends to merge all
     (three) means-tested benefits including the heating (gas, wood and district heating) subsidy
     into a single program targeted to the poorest quintile of the population, called the Minimum
     Social Insertion Income (MSIY) Program. The MSIY program, introduced by the Social
     Assistance Framework Law in December 2011, is expected to be operational in 2013. The
     new program represents a first-best solution to mitigate the negative impact on the removal
     of energy subsidies on the poor. The MSIY will ensure a greater coverage of the population
     in the poorest quintile, offer more generous benefits, and provide stronger incentives to work

     providing technical assistance to help the Romanian Government select its key parameters42.

101. The long-run impact of energy price deregulation is expected to be beneficial. In the
medium to long term, an enhanced energy regulatory authority and improved sector governance
will have a beneficial impact through reduction of costs and enhancement of efficiency in the
sector. Deregulation will foster private investment and technology transfers that will help
enhance Romania‟s energy security.

102. The DPL-DDO prior actions in the health sector are expected to have beneficial
poverty, social and gender impacts. This impact will be felt through supporting measures that
reallocate resources away from expenditures on medications for unapproved use and towards
improvements in the provision of health services.

    Access to health is currently highly skewed towards the rich with 81 percent of those in the
     top income quintile having access to health services compared with 52 percent of the poor.
     The reforms proposed by the DPL-DDO will reduce wastage and reallocate resources
     towards expanding access to health care, including preventative health programs. The elderly
     (who are also more likely to be female) will also benefit from this shift in resource use.
    Elimination of unnecessary and costly medications from the basic health package and
     increased prescription of generic drugs will free an estimated €100 million that will be
     redirected to priority expenditures, in particular primary and preventive care.
    Similarly, savings generated by the reduction in the number of acute beds will be redirected
     mainly to primary and ambulatory care. Currently patients are routinely admitted to hospital
     in cases in which out-patient treatment would be both medically sounder and less costly.
    The health reforms supported by the DPL-DDO will be particularly beneficial for women.
     The shift of resources towards the elderly supported by the health reform program will
     benefit women most, as their life expectancy is significantly higher.

                                        B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

103. The policy reforms supported by the DPL-DDO program are expected to have a
positive environmental impact43. The transposition of the EU Third Package of Energy
Reforms is expected to have beneficial environmental impacts. First, market-based pricing will
reduce the energy waste associated with subsidized regulated prices. Romania‟s economy is
significantly more energy-intensive than the European average and the price reform will help
reduce energy intensity. Second, savings generated by more competitive contracting and price
deregulation will foster investment in plant modernization, including better compliance with the
EU environmental safeguards. Third, the planned privatization in 2013 of the Oltenia Energy
Complex, which includes Romania‟s three largest lignite-fired power stations and the mines that
feed them, would improve compliance with the EU environmental safeguards. Studies on these

43
   The energy sector is known to have potentially large environmental impacts. For Romania, these are discussed
with relation to climate change in the recent Functional Review of the Ministry of Economy, the Energy Sector and
Business Environment.

three power stations established the scope of required modernization investment. The
Government concluded that private sector investment resources and management skills are
required for their successful implementation. The Oltenia Energy Complex will engage reputable
advisors for the privatization process, including the management of environmental issues.
Higher energy efficiency moderating demand growth and development of natural gas resources
and renewable energy will help contain the use of coal and lignite in power generation.
Unprofitable coal mines will be closed under a program for which the European Commission has
approved the provision of state aid to enable the Government to provide for a gradual and orderly
closing process.44 Fourth, the forthcoming package of measures for the oil and gas sector,
including the liberalization of domestic gas producer prices, is expected to encourage investment
in the exploration and production of natural gas, both onshore and offshore.

104. The Government is supporting private investment in renewable energy. Romania has
already in place a generous support system to promote renewable energy development, and wind
power development has already seen very strong growth45. The support system provides above
market prices and priority generation status for guaranteed off-take. The improvement in energy
efficiency (which will moderate demand growth), the development of natural gas resources and
the accelerated development of renewable energy will all help contain the use of coal and lignite
in power generation and will reduce local and greenhouse gas emissions.

105. Romania has adequate environmental safeguards and is improving implementation;
however, major challenges remain. Romanian environmental legislation and regulation is
aligned with EU environmental directives, including the 2001 Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA), Directive 2001/42/EU on the adoption of environmental assessments at the
planning and programming level, the Environmental Liabilities Directive setting out liability for
damage to properties and natural resources (April 2007), and relevant EU energy sector
regulations and standards. The country is implementing an environmental management system
(EMS) including the issuance for integrated environmental permits of industries. Romania‟s
capacity to implement environmental management practices has been strengthened since joining
the EU in 2007. The Bank considers Romania to be the only country in the ECA region that
conforms to OP 4.0046 with respect to Environmental Assessment (EA) implementation
practices. Progress notwithstanding, the authorities recognize the need for further improvements
in the implementation of environmental standards, which will be achieved through investment in
human resources, information technology, strategic planning, and coordination47. Romania also

   The World Bank is providing assistance for an earlier phase of Romania‟s mines closures under the Mine Closure,
Environment and Socio-Economic Regeneration Project (PO 87807) and during 1999-2006 under the Mine Closure
and Social Mitigation Project (P056337).

   Over 900 MW of wind power have been installed in 2011 alone.
46
   A safeguard diagnostic review carried out in 2006 in line with the OP/BP 4.00 “On Piloting the Use of Borrower
Systems to Address Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in Bank-Supported Projects? concluded that in the
area of Environmental Assessment the Romanian systems and the Bank policies are equivalent.
47
   One of the most recent major studies was carried out by the World Bank in 2010/11. The Functional Review of
the Environment, Water and Forestry prepared an action plan to help the Government strengthen the effectiveness
and efficiency of environmental administration. Romania‟s environmental challenges, including outstanding cases
concerning compliance and fulfillment of the commitments assumed in the negotiations of the Environment Chapter
for EU Accession, are summarized in a country profile published by the EU Directorate General for the
Environment in early 2012.

                                                       39
needs to accelerate the absorption of EU structural funds with a view to meeting considerable
investment needs, especially in the water sector.

                     C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

106. The Bank will closely monitor Government’s macroeconomic policy framework and
its adherence to the reform program, as described in the Letter of Development Policy
(LDP). The monitoring arrangements agreed with the Government consists of: (a) a quarterly
assessment of the medium-term macroeconomic framework and its implementation; and (b) a
quarterly assessment of progress with the implementation of the reform agenda pledged by the
Government in the LDP and the achievement of the expected outcomes. The Bank‟s quarterly
supervision will be coordinated with the IMF and the EU, and will be carried out jointly with
these institutions for as long as their programs continue in Romania.

107. The Bank has agreed with the Government on specific monitoring responsibilities.
The Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) will be responsible for the overall implementation of the
reform program supported by the DPL-DDO, for coordinating actions among other concerned
ministries and agencies, and for providing regular monitoring reports on the implementation of
the macroeconomic framework (including the Financing Plan) and of the reform agenda,
including the expected outcomes (Annex 2) of the DPL-DDO. MoPF will also ensure access to
the requisite data and reports produced by the NBR, the Ministries of Economy, Health, and
other ministries and agencies as needed, which the Bank needs to assess the implementation of
reforms and achievement of outcomes.

                                     D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

108. The Bank has extensive knowledge of the country’s Public Financial Management
(PFM) system. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was completed at the
end of 2003, while a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and a Public Expenditure
and Institutional Review (PEIR) were published in 2005 and 2006, respectively. A Functional
Review of the Ministry of Public Finance has been carried out in 2010. Regular updates of PFM
recent reform activities have been carried out over the recent years, and other external PFM
reports have been consulted for presenting this current PFM status.

109. The CFAA deemed the overall fiduciary risk associated with the PFM system
moderate. In the areas of accounting, reporting and internal control, the fiduciary risk was
considered significant, partly due to the heavy dependence on manual accounting and reporting
processes, weak arrangements for management accountability and the limited modern internal
audit capabilities. The fiduciary risk was considered moderate in the fields of budgeting,
treasury, cash management and external audit and parliamentary oversight. The fiduciary risk
related to Bank‟s lending operations was considered low.




                                              40
110. In response to the recommendations of the CFAA, the Government has taken action
to improve coordination and management of PFM reform and strengthen internal control,
financial reporting and auditing systems. A number of the CFAA recommendations have
already been addressed by the Government, including in the areas of treasury management,
harmonization of accounting standards and practices, decentralization and rationalization of ex-
ante financial control and strengthening internal audit functions. The organization and
effectiveness of the Court of Accounts has also been improved, and an updated Local Public
Finance Law was adopted in 2010 and became effective in January 2011. Overall, steady
progress has been made in the development of PFM systems and institutions.

111. Romania’s progress during 2006-2008 in Government budget transparency as
measured by the Open Budget Index assessment (OBI) was partly reversed in 2010. During
the OBI 2010 assessment Romania was downgraded from “Government provides substantial
information? to “Government provides some information?. According to OBI, the remaining
budget issues include the absence of pre-budget statements, of a citizens‟ budget and of a mid-
year review, and the fact that only partial information is available in-annual and audit reports for
areas such as the Government‟s budget proposal.

112. In response to these developments, the Government’s program to be supported by
the DPL-DDO will focus on strengthening budget transparency, efficiency and
predictability. Actions supported by the proposed DPL-DDO emphasize replacement of ad-hoc
decisions by strategic policy planning and coordination, consistent publication of budget
proposals and execution, strict adherence to budget allocations, introduction of budget
programming and performance indicators, and consultations with relevant stakeholders.

113. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) can be relied upon to hold proceeds from
development policy operations. The June 2011 IMF safeguards assessment concluded that
safeguards in place at NBR are generally adequate and the weaknesses identified by the previous
August 2009 and June 2005 safeguards assessments have been addressed. NBR can be therefore
relied upon to account for the Bank‟s loan proceeds from development policy operations,
assuming that the arrangements are otherwise in accordance with the Bank‟s policies and with
specific mutually agreed terms for the operation in question. The Bank needs to take no further
action in this area.

                                 E. DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING

114. The proposed loan will follow the World Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy loans. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases, and evidence
will therefore not be needed to support disbursements, nor will procurement requirements be
necessary. The front-end and stand-by fees will be covered from the Borrower‟s own sources. At
the request of the MoPF, the Bank will deposit the proceeds of the loan into MoPF foreign
exchange deposit account at the NBR that forms part of the general foreign exchange reserves.
If loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, the Bank,
upon notice, will require the Borrower to refund such amount promptly, and such amount shall
be cancelled. The Borrower can apply for withdrawal of the DPL-DDO funds in one or several
allocations during a period of three years after the approval of the loan by the Executive

                                                41
Directors and signing of the loan agreement. This period could be extended for a further three
years.

115. Eligibility for disbursement of the DPL-DDO will be assessed on a quarterly basis
against explicit criteria agreed with the Government and described in the Government’s
LDP. The Government has indicated that the DPL-DDO funds will be part of the fiscal buffer,
which was defined in the Government Public Debt Strategy 2011-2013 and in the Fiscal
Budgetary Strategy for 2012-2014, and is in accordance with the Fiscal Compact Convergence
Program for 2012-2015. Further, it has been agreed that in the case of shocks that are beyond the
control of the Government and that cause significant challenges to the financing strategy, the
Government can draw the DPL-DDO funds. The Bank will carry out quarterly assessments on
the following criteria: (i) the medium-term macroeconomic framework and its implementation
has been assessed to be satisfactory and (ii) satisfactory progress has been made with the reform
agenda and expected outcomes as laid out in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex 2), and
formally notify the Government whether Romania is eligible to draw the DPL-DDO resources
after completing such assessments.

116. MoPF will be responsible for the administration and accounting of loan proceeds.
The standard country rules will be followed by Treasury for administration and accounting. The
proceeds of the loan deposited at the NBR will be used to cover the budget deficit and/or public
debt refinancing. MoPF will be responsible for preparing withdrawal applications along with
maintaining the deposit account as required. With the assistance of NBR it will maintain records
of all transactions under the deposit account in accordance with sound accounting practices. The
Borrower will report to the Bank within 30 days after receiving the loan amounts by sending a
confirmation letter on the loan amounts deposited in the foreign currency deposit account.

117. The proceeds of the DPL-DDO, if and when disbursed, will be deposited by the
Bank in an account chosen by the Borrower at the NBR and an audit of that account will
not be required. The client may choose to withdraw part or the whole portion of the loan
proceeds when the need arises, provided the implementation of the reform program as defined in
this Program Document and LDP (Annex 1) remains on track and macroeconomic performance
is satisfactory.

                                 F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

118. The proposed DPL-DDO program entails substantial political, social and economic
risks, as well as implementation capacity constraints. The main risks and constraints include
the following:
   Economic and financial risks stem from external developments and domestic constraints.
    The turbulent global economic environment and the continued recession in the Eurozone
    could suppress demand for exports and capital inflows, put pressure on fiscal and external
    balances, increase the vulnerability of the financial sector, and undermine growth and
    employment prospects. Romania is highly vulnerable to EU market developments, with 73
    percent of exports going to EU member countries, foreign financing of EU owned banks
    amounting to 19 percent of GDP, high (65-70 percent) euroization of the economy,
    substantial financing of the current account by workers‟ remittances (largely from EU
    countries) amounting to 2.4 percent of GDP, and high external debt. These vulnerabilities

                                               42
    could discourage new investment and prompt the exit of some existing investors, lower debt
    roll-over rates, and put pressure on the exchange rate and the balance of payments. The
    moderate 1.5 percent growth projected in 2012 hinges on increased domestic demand,
    including aggressive mobilization of EU structural and cohesion funds. The austerity
    measures stipulated by the 2012 budget program which would reduce the fiscal deficit from
    4.1 percent in 2011 to 2.2 percent and low absorption of EU funds may depress domestic
    demand and slow down growth.
   Social risks are associated primarily with the potential economic slowdown that would affect
    employment and wages; the lingering impact of the 2010 fiscal austerity package; the
    implementation of policy reforms such as the introduction of co-payments for healthcare
    services, the rationalization of social assistance programs, the recalculation of special
    pensions, the implementation of the Unified Pay Law (UPL) and further reduction in public
    sector employment, and the restructuring or/and privatization of SOEs; and the planned
    increases in energy prices (natural gas, district heating, petrol, electricity) under the Third EU
    Energy Reform Package.
   Political risks stem from the change in Government in early-May 2012 and approaching
    local and parliamentary elections in June and November 2012, respectively. The DPL-DDO
    was initiated, appraised and substantively negotiated with the previous Government that
    represented a different political coalition. However, DPL-DDO negotiations were completed
    with a new Government. This Government will be responsible for implementation until late-
    2012, when parliamentary elections will be held. The elections may lead to the relaxation of
    public spending objectives and may delay reforms that could be perceived to carry social
    costs (especially in health) or that are opposed by strong vested interests (mainly in energy).
   Capacity constraints include: (i) lack of a coherent strategic vision of Romania‟s path to EU
    convergence; (ii) limited Government capacity to design and implement economic policies
    and reforms, coordinate sector and local initiatives, and carry out consultations of
    stakeholders in a participatory manner; (iii) insufficient Parliament capacity to harmonize
    new legislation with past and EU legislation, and weak grasp of economic and financial
    matters; (iv) limited central administration capacity to design, implement and monitor
    reforms, and to mobilize EU funds; and (v) unproven capacity of local administrations to
    assume new responsibilities stemming from health and education sector reforms.

119.   These risks are partly mitigated by Government actions supported by the IFIs:

   Economic and financial risks are partly mitigated by ongoing and envisaged structural
    reforms, strong Government commitment to macroeconomic stabilization, extension of the
    multilateral program with the IMF and the EU, and the proposed extension of the program
    supported by the World Bank through the DPL-DDO. These measures are expected to help
    Romania weather better the impact of the deepening crisis in the Eurozone and the risk of
    contagion. The 2012 budget will reduce fiscal pressures and help lower external financing
    needs. The DPL-DDO would help strengthen tax administration and mobilization of
    domestic resources, continue reforms aimed at improved efficiency of public sector
    spending, foster growth and employment, and serve as a fiscal buffer. EU funds would
    alleviate to some extent fiscal constraints and reduce borrowing requirements. NBR has so
    far managed well pressures on the national currency, foreign exchange reserves are at
    historically high levels, and the new precautionary agreements with the IMF and the EU (as
    well as the proposed DPL-DDO) provide a cushion in case of need. The financial sector

                                                 43
       reform program supported by the SBA includes in-depth examinations and recapitalization
       requirements, strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory powers, the preparation of a
       strategic action plan for the banking sector to respond in the event of a crisis, and the
       establishment of a framework to facilitate private and corporate debt restructuring. An
       important operational risk mitigation measure is that if the Bank assesses that at least one of
       the two drawdown conditions - an adequate macroeconomic or satisfactory program
       implementation - is not met and has notified Romania to this effect, the Bank will not
       disburse under the DPL-DDO.
      Social risks are partially mitigated by social assistance measures targeting benefits to the
       needy, and by communication with social partners. Increased unemployment and social
       assistance benefits have helped the vulnerable to better withstand the consequences of the
       economic decline, contributing to limiting absolute poverty to 5.2 percent of households in
       2010.48 The previous DPL series supported increases in funding of the well-targeted GMI
       program and income-tested child allowances. The Bank has also expanded communication
       efforts with social partners, including main trade union confederations and business
       associations. These measures notwithstanding, social risks remain high given the subdued
       economic outlook for 2012 and fiscal constraints. The results-based operation for the reform
       of social assistance approved in April 2011 is expected to help manage better budget
       resources allocated to social assistance programs and will yield benefits in the medium-term,
       but would not be able to reduce social risks rapidly.
      Political risks are mitigated by the Bank‟s (and other IFIs‟) continuous dialogue with the
       political opposition. The new Government is well informed on the rationale for fiscal and
       economic reforms, supports these reforms, and is committed to respecting the EU Fiscal
       Compact. The new Government has also indicated its determination to strengthen the
       dialogue with the Parliament, the civil society, and other stakeholders, with a view to
       ensuring the sustainability of reforms. The appointment of experienced technocrats and
       administrators in the new Government is expected to minimize transition costs and the delays
       inherent in any change in administration. There is broad consensus across the political
       spectrum on the need to continue macroeconomic stabilization and economic reform efforts,
       to respect commitments under the EU Fiscal Compact, and to continue the partnership with
       IFIs. Romania is expected to continue its reform agenda irrespective of the outcome of the
       November 2012 elections.
      Capacity bottlenecks are partly addressed through ongoing initiatives supported in
       particular by the EU and the Bank, and which aim to strengthen capacity at the center of
       Government and in key ministries on the basis of the Government‟s action plans stemming
       from recommendations of the Functional Reviews. The Government has also obtained Bank
       support for the implementation of a strategic planning capacity in the Prime Minister‟s office
       through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) operation, whose implementation is about
       to be launched. More needs to be done to address capacity shortcomings in local
       administrations and in the Parliament.

Annex 1: Letter of Development Policy

Mr. Robert Zoellick
President, World Bank
Washington DC

Dear Mr. Zoellick,

     This letter summarizes the key aspects of our programme to accelerate economic recovery in
Romania and place the growth on a sustainable, socially inclusive path. It focuses on the elements of our
reform programme that link to the pillars of the DPL-DDO programme. These are: (i) increasing budget
revenues through improved tax compliance and fiscal discipline; (ii) improving the governance of state
owned enterprises (SOE) in the energy sector to enhance their efficiency and contribution to the budget;
and (iii) enhancing fiscal sustainability and improving service in the health sector through the
optimization of public health services.

     With support from the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and World Bank, we
have taken strong fiscal and structural reform measures during 2009-2011 in areas that were exposed to
the crisis as bottlenecks for sustainable and equitable growth: public finance, education, pension, labour
markets, health, social assistance and others. These measures allowed the economy to return to positive
growth in 2011 at a rate of 2.5 percent, while the prospects for growth in 2012 remain relatively stable, at
an expected 1.5 percent, despite substantial downside risks associated with the economic conditions in
Europe.

     The Government‟s key medium term objective remains to foster growth while gradually bringing the
structural fiscal deficit to below 1 percent of GDP, as per the EU Treaty on Stability, Coordination and
Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (EU Fiscal Compact) which we recently signed (even
though we are not yet a member of the Eurozone). In 2011, we met the fiscal deficit target of 4.4 percent
of GDP, and we aim to contain the fiscal deficit below 3 percent of GDP according to EU Growth and
Stability Pact fiscal deficit target. The 2011-2013 National Reform Programme and the 2012-2014 Fiscal
Strategy propose further short to medium-term reforms aimed at strengthening macroeconomic and fiscal
management, increasing the efficiency and transparency of public administration, and improving business
environment. These reflect our strong and steady commitment to continue reforms aimed at improving
living standards and catching up with the rest of the European Union. Further adjustments and reforms in
the public sector, including strengthening financial discipline in state-owned enterprises, are needed to
reduce arrears and quasi-fiscal deficits and contain pressures for increased deficits in the future and
support growth.

      Our comprehensive reform agenda and regained macro stability have reassured the financial
markets. This has enabled us to tap international financial markets with two recent bond transactions, both
substantially oversubscribed, worth USD 1.5 billion in February 2012 and re-opening of USD 750 million
one month later, at declining interest rates. At the same time, we have succeeded in raising significant
amounts by issuing government securities on domestic market in the first three months of 2012, as yields
have been falling across maturities. To meet the Government‟s financing needs for the period 2012-2015;
we have taken measures to continue to improve our access to the international financial markets, despite
an uncertain global environment and continued high market volatility and liquidity constraints in the
Eurozone. Specifically, in June 2011 we have established and upgraded to Rule 144A a three-year
medium-term notes programme (GMTN) with a total principal aggregate amount of € 7 billion which will
facilitate our constant access to the markets and enhance our dialogue with the market players and
financial intermediaries. The two 2012 international bond issuances cited above are part of the GMTN,
and further bond placements are planned. We have also maintained a continuous dialogue with domestic

                                                    45
financial intermediaries, especially with the primary dealers and pension funds. This way we want to
ensure that the domestic and international capital markets remain the main source of government
financing during 2012-2015, as reflected in our financing plan.

         In addition, given the ongoing protracted crisis in Europe leading to significant uncertainty in
financial markets, we have decided to ask for your assistance through a contingent facility, namely the
Development Policy Loan with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DPL-DDO). Romania is building a fiscal
buffer, equivalent to around 4 months of financing needs for 2012 and onwards, as it is stipulated in the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the IMF and EC in February 2012. The
buffer was defined in the Public Government Debt Strategy 2011-2013 and in the Fiscal Budgetary
Strategy for 2012-2014 and is in the accordance with the Convergence Program for 2012-2015. The DPL-
DDO will form part of our fiscal buffer and will ensure access to resources in case markets failed to
provide financing at reasonable cost. The loan funds will be withdrawn based on an appropriate
macroeconomic framework and progress with the reform programme as summarized in this LDP. We
agree that a quarterly assessment of our macroeconomic framework and progress in the DPL-DDO reform
programme will be carried out by the Bank.

     The details regarding the reform actions to be undertaken by the Government during 2012-2015 in
public finance, energy and health, with the support of the DPL-DDO programme, are presented below:

Measures to improve Public Financial Management

        To respond to the challenges of the Fiscal Compact, we will promote over the next three years a
number of key good practice measures in revenue and expenditure management with the objectives of
maintaining macroeconomic stability and achieving a better alignment of the budget formulation and
execution processes with the development priorities of the country.

Strengthening the budget process:

    Since 2010 our Government has implemented measures to strengthen control over public
expenditures and to enhance public expenditure management. These measures include:
     The adoption of the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2010 to enhance fiscal discipline and improve
        public finance management;
     The establishment of the Fiscal Council in that same year to improve transparency and
        accountability on fiscal issues;
     The preparation of the Fiscal Strategy for the period 2012- 2014 to set clear medium term
        ceilings for key budget indicators; and
     The adoption of the Unitary Pay Law in 2010 to reform public pay while reducing personnel
        costs over the short and medium-term.

   Continued strengthening of budget management in 2012 and the following years remains a priority.
Therefore, we seek to increase discipline over the policy making process and prioritize policy decisions
by consolidating the strategic planning capacity in the centre of the Government and improving the
annual approval workflow of the Cabinet. As such, we plan to take the following measures:
    In 2013 we will refine the legal framework for public finance management to enhance the
        Ministry of Public Finance‟s ability to facilitate expenditure prioritization and to better monitor
        annual and multi-year expenditure commitments. This new framework will propose a clear
        calendar for the preparation, approval and execution of the annual budget, and will introduce
        standards for reporting on the results achieved by budget users.
    Before end-2012, the Government will approve strategic plans for at least two ministries based on
        the ceilings established in the Fiscal Budgetary Strategy, and in 2014 the same pilot ministries

                                                    46
        will produce a performance report on their achievement against the 2013 plan. The strategic plans
        will define the medium term policy objectives of the ministry, and present the programmes of the
        ministry responding to those objectives, with key performance indicators attached, and a multi-
        annual framework with the budgetary resources needed to meet them.
       Because linking resources to results is important, we will require pilot ministries to provide
        strategic-level performance indicators with which to measure progress against their key policy
        priorities. Reporting on the quality of spending will be a long-term process, but we will gradually
        increase the number of pilots from two to six for the 2014 budget, incorporating lessons learned
        from prior pilots.
       In order to increase the EU funds absorption and to reduce the stock of arrears at the local level in
        April 2012 the Government approved during 2012 funds from the state budget can be allocated to
        local authorities for co-financing of EU projects and to pay such arreas

Strengthening fiscal transparency:

    Our efforts to improve fiscal transparency, which began with the establishment of the Fiscal Council
in 2010, will continue with enhancements in the presentation of budget execution data to the general
public. In particular, we will:
     Publish the annual budget execution reports for 2012, 2013 and 2014 in a format that is easy for
         stakeholders to read and understand how the public resources were spent and what was achieved
         with them. To have a clear understanding about how resources link with policies, we will include
         expenditure information by sub-function (i.e., the second level in the Classifications of the
         Functional of Government (COFOG)) to these budget execution reports, starting with four
         budgetary chapters for the 2012 budget year, increasing to six for 2013, and extending it to all
         budgetary chapters starting with 2014.

Improving revenue collection and tax administration:

        Our recent fiscal challenges brought renewed attention to raising revenue administration
performance while minimizing collection costs and reducing compliance costs for taxpayers. In 2010 we
introduced through a NAFA President Order the obligation of e-filing for the medium and large tax
payers for the tax declarations available for e-filing. Also, in mid 2011 we established a specialized
department within NAFA to focus on the verification of the high net worth individuals.

     To improve revenue collection and reduce the cost of tax administration, in April 2012 we approved a
memorandum that outlines the plan for the modernization of tax administration, including the
restructuring of the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (NAFA). The key measures we will
include in this area over the medium term are as follows:
      The optimization of the local tax office network for small tax payers, which will be reduced from
         the current 221 to one office per county plus one office per each sector of Bucharest, respectively
         47, by end-2015;
      The increase of voluntary compliance by engaging with the net worth individuals tax payers
         through adequate fiscal treatments;
      The achievement of 96 percent tax e-filing by legal persons by end 2014 for the tax declarations
         available for e-filing.
      The implementation of risk-based audit procedures based on more effective segmentation of
         taxpayers and risk assessment starting in 2012, leading to higher tax compliance by 2015.

    Measures we will take in tax administration will also improve the business climate. Specifically, we
will:


                                                    47
        Continue to take measures for the simplification and reduction of the number of taxes by end-
         2014. The reforms should result in a reduction in the number of tax payments and improvements
         in Romania‟s ranking in the Paying Taxes Report.
        Review the Fiscal Code by end-2012 based on the input from Tax Board which we formed in
         April 2012. Enhancing transparency and simplifying the Fiscal Code should facilitate voluntary
         compliance of tax payers and over time enhance revenues.

Public Financial Management Outcomes:

    Through implementation of the above reforms we expect to achieve the following outcomes in the
area of public financial management:
     Tax revenue collected by NAFA increases by €500 million to €37.5 billion in 2014, from €37
         billion 2011.
     Tax administration costs are reduced to 1.05 percent of tax revenue in 2014, from 1.11 percent in
         2011.
     The general Government budget deficit is below 3 percent of GDP in cash terms as of 2012.

Measures to improve the governance of SOEs in the energy sector to enhance their profitability,
efficiency, and contribution to the budget

    We recognize that the limited performance of the some energy sector SOEs influences the long term
development prospects. We have launched a comprehensive programme of reform in the energy sector to
realize our vision and to make the energy sector: an engine of growth; a secure foundation for economic
activity and social development; a contributor of revenues (dividends, taxes and royalties) into the budget;
and a competitive and transparent market place for efficient private and public companies.

     Reforms required to achieve our vision cover: (a) measures to improve governance and contracting
practices in the energy sector; and (b) legislative and regulatory measures to improve competition, and to
attract private investment and align the energy sector with the EU‟s Third Package of Energy Reforms.
Given Romania‟s energy resources (oil, gas, coal/lignite, uranium, hydro and other renewable sources)
and potential for market development, energy is perhaps the most promising sector for attracting large-
scale private domestic and foreign investment and spurring economic growth. Our reform agenda in
energy is thus comprehensive and rests on the following pillars:

Restructuring of SOE boards and management:

         Several key SOEs in the energy sector have the potential to become engines of economic growth
in the coming years. To realize this potential:
      We are reforming the corporate governance of key SOEs by professionalizing their Boards and
         management. Under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Business Environment coordination,
         Hidroelectrica, Nuclearelectrica, Romgaz and Electrica Furnizare started, the procedure to hire in
         April 2012 the executive search firm to assist in the selection of appointees to the boards of
         administration, in accordance with the principles of the Emergency Ordinance 109/2011 on SOE
         Governance. The new boards of administration will be formally appointed for Hidroelectrica and
         Electrica Furnizare by end-June 2012 and for Nuclearelectrica and Romgaz by end-September
         2012. By end-June 2012 it will be also finalized the selection of the new General Manager of
         Hidroelectrica, for the others by end-October 2012.
      In April 2012, we constituted an interim Board of Administration of the new Oltenia Energy
         Complex, so that we can establish and register the company in May 2012. The permanent Board


                                                    48
         of Administration will be selected, in accordance with the SOE Corporate Governance Law, by
         end-September 2012. This will be followed by the selection of a CEO by end-October 2012.
        The measures above support the Government‟s new energy reform plan which focuses on
         individual companies such as Hidroelectrica and the merger of mines and power plants into two
         coal and lignite complexes, Hunedoara and Oltenia. The new plan follows the decision of the
         Strategic Defence Council of October 2011 to cancel the “National Energy Champions Plan?,
         under which all electricity generation and coal mines would have been merged into two large
         entities. The new plan reduces cross-subsidies between efficient and inefficient units, allows for
         more transparency in the management of SOEs, and improves the prospects for competition
         enhancing the benefits of market liberalization for the end-consumer.

Improving the cash flow of Energy SOEs:

         Energy suppliers have been experiencing cash flow problems because the state-owned companies
such as the Railway Company CFR Rail Infrastructure have not paid its electricity bills. We will finalize a
government-guaranteed loan to clear CFR Rail Infrastructure arrears to private energy providers. The
Ministry of Transports and Infrastructure and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Business Enviroment
will closely work with Electrica and CFR Rail Infrastructure to find a solution for the cancellation of
penalities and gradually payment of the principal on arrears owed by CFR Rail Infrastructure to Electrica.
We will continue to work with the Bank and the IMF to ensure that this issue does not come up again in
the future.

Strengthening the legal framework for the electricity sector:

       We are adjusting Romania‟s regulatory and legal framework to ensure the liberalization of energy
markets and implementation of EU Directives for the single market in gas and electricity. To this aim:
    In March 2012 we approved and submitted to the Parliament the new electricity law transposing
       the electricity part of the EU‟s Third Energy Package. After its approval by the Parliament, in
       principle expected in June 2012, the law will be effectively implemented.
    One key provision of the new electricity law consists of ensuring the full financial and
       operational independence of the energy regulator ANRE to restore its capacity and competence as
       a regulatory body of similar importance to the Competition Council. This will be implemented
       within 30 days of the effectiveness of the law.
    In March 2012, we approved a roadmap to phase out regulated prices in electricity. We will also
       carry out an analysis and implement potential measures to protect vulnerable consumers and
       ensure competition in response to price liberalization. To liberalize the market, ANRE will
       progressively increase the share of electricity sourced from the deregulated market by electricity
       supply companies, reaching 100 percent for their non-residential tariff customers by January 1,
       201449 and for their residential consumers by January 1, 201850.
    As an immediate action, all tariffs for non-residential and residential consumers will be increased
       by 5 percent by end-June 2012.
    The regulatory framework for electricity distribution and supply will be notified by end-2012 and
       implemented starting January 1, 2013 for the third (2013-2017) regulatory period. Deferred
       revenue accumulated during the second (2008-2012) regulatory period will be recovered.
    We will ensure effective implementation of the legal and regulatory framework for electricity in

      The approved schedule is: 15 percent on September 1, 2012, 30 percent on January 1, 2013, 45 percent on April 1, 2013,
65 percent on July 1, 2013, 85 percent on October 1, 2013, and 100 percent from January 1, 2014.
50
     The approved schedule is: 10 percent on July 1, 2013, 20 percent on January 1, 2014, 30 percent on July 1, 2014, 40 percent
on January 1, 2015, 50 percent on July 1, 2015, 60 percent on January 1, 2016, 70 percent on July 1, 2016, 80 percent on January
1, 2017, 90 percent on July 1, 2017, and 100 percent from January 1, 2018.

                                                              49
        2013, 2014, 2015 and onwards.

Strengthening the legal framework for the gas sector:

    To achieve our goals in the gas sector:
     In March 2012 we established a Inter-ministerial Committee for oil and gas, that will prepare a
        roadmap, similar to the electricity roadmap, for the gradual removal of regulated gas prices to
        non-residential and residential consumers, together with measures to protect vulnerable
        residential consumers; and, in consultation with the oil and gas industry, a package of tax, legal
        and regulatory measures for the oil and gas sector. The package will cover two parts: (a) a
        windfall levy to capture a part of the extraordinary revenue to firms resulting from the
        liberalization of gas prices, as specified in the roadmap. Funds raised will help finance measures
        to protect vulnerable consumers from the impact of price adjustments; and (b) a broader package
        specifying Romania‟s oil and gas regulatory and taxation regime, to be prepared, with
        professional advice, by end-2012. We will approve the gas roadmap by government
        memorandum and our draft legislation transposing the gas part of the EU‟s Third Energy Package
        by emergency ordinance of the government by end-June 2012.
     Regulated gas prices for non-households will be increased in a broadly linear fashion starting in
        December 2012. ANRE will increase gradually the domestic gas producer price until its
        convergence with average European prices by end-2014. Prices for non-households will be fully
        liberalized beginning in January 2015, unless a large gap remains between the average European
        price and the import price in Romania (which could endanger market stability), in which case
        adjustment and regulated gas prices would continue until end-2015. For households, regulated gas
        prices will be increased starting in July 2013 until the convergence between the domestic gas
        producer price and the average European gas prices will be achieved, but no later than end-2018.
        The gap between gas costs and recognized pass-through tariffs reached about 25 percent in 2010.
        We have increased the unitary cost of gas (CUG) to non-residential customers by almost 20
        percent in 2011 and by 5 percent on January 1, 2012. ANRE will implement its gas supply
        regulation in a timely manner, based on the schedule of the gas law agreed with EU, to avoid
        recurrence of this issue.
     At the same time, we will take measures to ensure that the vulnerable categories will be protected
        from the price deregulation.
     In addition, the regulatory framework for gas distribution and supply will be notified by end-2012
        and implemented from January 1, 2013 for the third (2013-2017) regulatory period. Deferred
        revenue accumulated during the second (2008-2012) regulatory period will be recovered.
     We will ensure effective implementation of the legal and regulatory framework for gas and the
        related tax measures in 2013, 2014, 2015 and onwards.

Improving SOE contracting practices:

        To ensure that the market liberalization allows non-discriminatory access of residential and
industrial consumers to energy produced by SOEs, we are revising SOE contracting practices. We have
taken measures with due regard to applicable legal and contractual rights and obligations, as well as due
process, to cancel, where possible, or renegotiate to market terms the existing non-competitively
contracted sales of energy and we will ensure that no new contracts are concluded by SOEs without a
competitive process in line with the Government Memorandum (DPES/172) issues on March 8, 2012,
allowing all consumers to have equal opportunities to access energy produced by SOEs under market
terms. Thus:
     In March 2012 we assessed the options to terminate all existing bilateral contracts of
        Hidroelectrica, which were concluded and/or extended without competitive tendering.
        Hidroelectrica terminated five contracts and we established a Commission to renegotiate the

                                                   50
        remaining 10 contracts, with due regard to applicable legal and contractual rights and obligations
        as well as due process, to ensure that their duration will not be extended, quantities are reduced,
        and prices are adjusted to market conditions consistent with applicable legal and contractual
        rights and obligations. Nine of 10 companies expressed their final proposals during the
        negotiations concluded on April 23, 2012. We have scheduled another round of negotiations in
        May in view of the EC announcement on April 25, 2012 of in-depth investigations to assess if
        Hidroelectrica sold electricity at preferential tariffs in breach of EU state aid rules, in principle
        expected to be completed before July 2012. The key elements of the contracts, including average
        price, duration and volume, will be posted by Hidroelectrica on its web-site within 30 days after
        finalization.
       All new contracts of SOEs in the energy sector, with the exception of exports at higher prices
        than the domestic ones, will be conducted transparently and non-discriminately through the
        power exchange run by the Romanian Power Market Operator (OPCOM) (electricity) and other
        competitive procedures (gas), and we will publish the contracts, through OPCOM. This measure
        is applicable immediately and through 2012, 2013, 2014, and thereafter.
       To ensure a competitive market place for gas (also, so that gas SOEs sell competitively), OPCOM
        will develop a gas trading platform by January 2013. We will provide the legal basis for the gas
        trading platform in the forthcoming new gas law mentioned earlier. After January 2013 all new
        contracts of gas SOEs will be conducted through the gas trading platform.
       During 2012 - 2015 and beyond we will ensure the proper implementation of the competitive
        contracting rules described above, including by refining the market instruments for electricity and
        gas trading provided by OPCOM.
       Once the gas trading platform is operational, we will offer, in line with the Romanian legislation,
        the shares of OPCOM to electricity and gas market participants and potentially other European
        energy exchanges, with the objective of achieving a wide participation of market participants in
        OPCOM's ownership as a basis for strong corporate governance.

Enhancing private sector participation in energy:

         The above measures concerning the corporate governance and contracting practices of SOEs and
gas and electricity market liberalization are critical to retain and attract private sector participation in the
financing and management of the energy sector. Financing needed to upgrade the energy sector cannot be
raised in the public sector alone, and energy is a sector in which major foreign investments can be
attracted by an adequate and predictable legal and regulatory environment. The private participation in
the existing SOEs will be attracted through IPOs for minority stakes and by offering for sale majority
shares:
      We will list shares for Hidroelectrica (IPO of 10 percent to increase capital), Nuclearelectrica
         (IPO of at least 10 percent via capital increase) and Romgaz (IPO of a 15 percent stake) on the
         Bucharest Stock Exchange in 2012. We plan to complete the initial public offerings of Romgaz
         by mid-September 2012, Hidroelectrica by mid-October 2012 and the sale of Nuclearelectrica
         shares by the end-2012. Hidroelectrica and Romgaz have already appointed well-qualified
         advisors for the listing of their shares. These listings come after the successful IPOs of
         Transelectrica in 2006 and Transgaz in 2007. In March 2012, we sold another 10 percent of our
         shares in Transelectrica and will make a secondary public offering of Transgaz shares by end-
         June 2012.
      We will offer for sale majority shares in the Oltenia Energy Complex, Elcen Bucuresti, Electrica
         (including Electrica Furnizare and the three Electrica electricity distribution companies), all three
         by early 2013. Ahead of the Electrica sale, we will also offer for sale Electrica‟s remaining
         shares in the already-privatized electricity distribution and supply companies.



                                                      51
Addressing arrears in district heating

        A major issue affecting the energy sector at both municipal and national level concerns the non-
payments of heat by district heating companies and municipalities to heat and electricity producers. We
will continue to monitor, and report to the IFIs on a quarterly basis, on the district heating system. To
avoid arrears in payments by municipalities, the Government will ensure that Ordinance no. 36/2006 as
amended by Emergency Ordinance no. 69/2011 will be applied.

Energy Sector Outcomes:

    Through the implementation of the above reforms we expect to achieve the following outcomes in the
energy sector:
     Extra revenue of euro 70 million from higher sale prices in the renegotiated bilateral contracts
        and avoided estimated loss of euro 73 million from non-acquisition of high-cost thermal power,
        for a total benefit of about euro 143 million, in 2013 and 2014.
     Electricity prices for non-residential consumers are fully deregulated by end-2013 (and
        thereafter).
     Regulated tariff sales account for a maximum of 25 percent of Romania‟s electricity supply in
        2014. Sales in the OPCOM Power Exchange and Transelectrica‟s balancing market account for a
        minimum of 50 percent of Romania‟s SOE electricity generation in 2014. Directly negotiated
        bilateral contracts account for a maximum of 20 percent of Romania‟s electricity generation in
        2014 and prices in these contracts reflect market prices at the OPCOM Power Exchange.

Measures to enhance the fiscal sustainability of the health sector through rationalization of public
health services

    In the healthcare sector, we intend to continue reforms, including the implementation of actions
supported by the 2009-11 DPL series. Although the progress achieved in implementing reform measures,
the health sector is still struggling to meet the needs of the population within the available scarce financial
resources. To address this issue, we have taken or plan to take the following reform measures:
     To increase health service quality and to rationalize the use of technology and high cost
        treatments, by April 2012 we excluded selected drugs compensated for indications outside the
        terms of their marketing approval, or for which there is no medical scientific evidence supporting
        the indication of such drugs in certain medical treatments, as identified in the final National
        Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) report,. The resulted savings will be
        reallocated to other health priorities, including national health care programs.
     In April 2012 we approved the institutional framework for the implementation of the Health
        Technology Assessment (HTA) and any further adjustments to the basic package of health
        services, which are a continuous process, will be done within this framework. The HTA provides
        evidence on the clinical effectiveness and the costs and benefits (long and short term) of new
        technology in the clinical practice.
     In 2013 Ministry of Health (MoH) will continue to streamline the basic package, by accelerating
        the elaboration and implementation of the defined evidence-based (Romania-specific) clinical
        protocols51 by various levels of care. These clinical protocols will define the services covered by
        the package at primary, secondary and tertiary level. We will gradually reallocate savings
        obtained by the elimination of subsidies for the excluded drugs in deficient arrears to increase the
        efficiency in the use of funds. Also we will strengthen the preventive programs during 2013-15,
        for example by expanding the currently limited and insufficient cervical cancer screening. In

51
  Clinical protocols or clinical guidelines are technical algorithms aiming to guide decisions and criteria regarding diagnosis,
management, and treatment in specific medical situations.

                                                              52
       2013 the preventive/health promotion programmes will be allocated 10 percent of the total
       Ministry of Health budget for National Programmes and we will gradually expand this to reach
       15 percent in 2015.
   •   By 2014 the new basic package will not focus on a positive list of diseases but on the use of
       standardized evidence-based clinical protocols.
   •   We aim to increase the access to quality health care services by strengthening primary care,
       increasing the number and type of ambulatory care services, and decreasing the use of in-patient
       service~. By reducing the number of admission we expect to optimize the hospital funding. To
       this purpose and in line with the Hospital Rationalization Strategy, in 2011 we have put in place a
       new hospital classification system and approved a National Hospital Master Bed Plan for 2011-
       2013. As a result, the total number of hospital care beds contracted by the NHIH in public and
       private hospitals will be reduced to 125,639 by end-2012 and to a maximum of 123,127 by end-
       2013. Also, we will implement effective rationalization, in terms of both structure and function,
       of health facilities and at least one hospital merging process that will combine three closely-
       located existing hospitals to generate a more comprehensive hospital, and a secondary care unit '
       will be implemented in 2014.

Health Sector Outcomes:

    Through implementation of the above reforms we expect to achieve the following outcomes in the
health sector:
    " Reimbursement by NHIH for compensated drugs will fall below 36% of the total budget of the
        National Fund of Health Insurance (FNUASS) in 2014.
    • Hospital beds contracted by NHIH in public and private hospitals is decreased to 125,639 in
        2012, and no more than 123,127 in 2013, compared with 129,524 in 2011.
    II  The budget allocation to health prevention and promotion programs increases at 15 percent out of
        the MoH budget for National Health Programmes in 2015.

    Finally, we would like to reiterate that the Government of Romania is committed to continue the
reforms implemented in pensions, education, social assistance, including those supported by previous
World Bank programs.

  Valorization is the adjustment of past contributions to account for the changes in the value of contributions between the time they are paid and the time pension
is claimed or calculated. In a point system, valorization is analogous to the procedure used to update the pension point value.

              Romania—Fourth Review Under the Stand-By Arrangement,
               and Request for Modification of the Performance Criterion
                            Executive Board Meeting 12/28

        Romania continues to make good progress under the precautionary Fund-
supported program. Policy implementation has remained strong and all program targets
were met. After two years of decline, economic growth has resumed and inflation has
fallen to historical lows. However, the economic outlook for this year is being weighed
down by the declining growth prospects in the euro area. Continued commitment to the
economic reform agenda is crucial to help withstand current uncertainties and increase
potential growth.

         The authorities remain firmly committed to their 2012 budget deficit target of
well below 3 percent of GDP. Continued strict spending discipline is needed to achieve
the target. Increased EU funds absorption and improved capital spending are key
priorities. Additional action is required to reform the health care sector and to improve
weak tax administration. Structural reforms of State-Owned Enterprises have progressed,
but faster implementation of restructuring efforts and enhanced regulation and market-
oriented pricing in the energy and transport sectors will be essential to reduce arrears,
improve economic efficiency, and boost growth.

        While risks in the banking system remain significant due to high non-performing
loans and potential financial spillovers from elsewhere in Europe, sizable capital buffers
exist to cushion the impact of any adverse shocks. Continued supervisory vigilance and
detailed operational procedures to quickly implement contingency plans remain essential.
External financing conditions have eased, although banks‟ external borrowing remains
skewed to the short-term. Inflation continues to decline, but the authorities should be
cautious in further monetary easing in light of risks of weakening of the currency and
possible capital outflows.
