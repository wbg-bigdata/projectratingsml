REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent
of US$6.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Technical Assist-
ance project. The proceeds of the Credit would be made available by the
Borrower to the Tanzania Investment Bank as a grant.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.        The last full economic report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was followed
by an Economic Updating Report (30-TA) distributed on December 11, 1972.
A basic economic mission is scheduled for 1976. An agricultural sector
report was issued on December 10, 1974. An industry and mining sector report
and a report on the fiscal aspects of Tanzania's recent decentralization of
Government were distributed in April 1975. The Consultative Group for East
Africa met in April 1975 to discuss the progress and prospects of the Tan-
zanian economy and the need for additional resources to support the Govern-
ment's development program. Country data are provided in Annex I, Tanzania
is one of the 25 least developed countries as defined by the United Nations.
3.        The TANU Party, under the leadership of President Nyerere, has
been the guiding force in Tanzania's political evolution since the 1950's.
Over the years following independence the political leadership has developed
a philosophy of egalitarian socialism which has been articulated in many
documents, most central of which is the Arusha Declaration of 1967. In
restructuring the political, economic and social life of the country the
leadership has introduced an impressive series of far-reaching institutional
reforms. For the past decade Tanzania's social and economic policy has been
guided by three fundamental objectives: (a) the achievement of a participatory,
decentralized socialist economic order; (b) the eradication of absolute poverty
and progress toward greater income equality; and (c) more rapid long-term
economic growth with full participation of all regions and population groups
in the development process. Some of the Government's most significant
decisions have been in the area of incomes policy; however, while considerable
progress has been made toward reducing inequality within the category of
employed workers, large gaps still exist between urban and rural standards
of living.
4.        Tanzania is one of the three Partner States belonging to the East
African Community. The 1967 Treaty for East African Cooperation is one of
the most far-reaching and comprehensive economic cooperation agreements in
existence among sovereign states. However, in practice the degree of economic



- 2 -
integration and cooperation among the Partner States is much less than what
was envisaged in the Treaty. Political developments in the Partner States
have created tensions within the Community and impaired the growth of inter-
state trade. These difficulties have been compounded by the balance of
payments crisis which currently faces all three Partner States.
5.        Between 1968 and 1973, Tanzania's GDP increased 4.6% per year in
real terms.  Exports of goods and services in constant prices grew 2.8%
per year during the same period. Domestic savings were maintained at about
18% of GDP.  Investment increased from 19% of GDP to 23% with public sector
investment rising to 80% of the total investment in 1973. Annual price
increases were moderate to low. Current Government receipts more than
doubled, but current expenditures increased at similar rates so that
budgetary savings stagnated. Although the level of domestic savings and
investment were substantial, the growth of GDP was probably not commensurate
with the investment effort. This was largely due to the high proportion of
investment that went into slow gestation infrastructure and social services,
and to the difficulties encountered in expanding production in agriculture.
The stagnation of agricultural export volumes and very slow growth in food
production were the most worrisome problems. However, prudent domestic
financial management, and an increasing inflow of external aid on conces-
sionary terms, together with a rather sharp terms of trade improvement in
1973, made it possible to maintain a high investment rate. Reserves at
the end of 1973 stood at a healthy $145 million which was then the equivalent
of four months' imports. Indeed, the economy appeared in relatively good
shape before the events of the winter of 1973-74.
6.        Events occurred then which resulted in a drastic change in the
overall balance of payments of Tanzania. Import prices rose sharply and
in 1973 and 1974 rains failed in many parts of the country necessitating
substantial increases in imports of basic food :items. As a result,
Tanzania's foreign exchange reserves declined by about $90 million in 1974
to a level representing about three weeks' imports and have remained at
about the same level since. Tanzania has been able to cover the 1975
foreign exchange gap by curtailing imports to the bare minimum and by securing
substantial program-type assistance including a $30 million Program Loan
(No. 1063 TA) from the Bank and drawings on the second IMF credit tranche
and the IMF special oil facility approved in August 1975.
7.        In order to close the gap in the longer term the Government has
begun a program of investment restructuring, improvements in the incentive
framework, administrative changes, and reduction in the rate of growth of
consumption. Under this program, the Government is reallocating public
investment from infrastructure development to the directly productive sectors
of agriculture, industry and mining. Actual public investment for directly
productive sectors is estimated at 41% of the total in 1974-75 and it is
planned to rise to 48% in 1975-76. Although the Government has made subs-
tantial progress in this endeavor, high level manpower constraints have
inhibited both project preparation and execution. The single largest
economic weakness is the slow growth of agricultural production. Several



steps have been taken to increase output. The Government has raised
producer prices to levels approaching world parity so as to provide greater
incentive. The steeply progressive export tax on coffee, which had an
average rate of 30%, has been reduced to an ad valorem rate of 12-1/2% to
provide further incentives to farmers. The overall planning capability of
the Ministry of Agriculture is being improved and a project coordination
unit to improve implementation has been established in the Ministry. The
negative impact of villagization on output is being reduced through more
careful planning. The Government is reducing unnecessary non-development
related recurrent expenditure and is using taxation and wage/price controls
to reduce the rate of growth of private consumption. The Government's
progress in implementing policies and programs designed to close the balance
of payments gap in accordance with understandings relating to the program
loan was the subj'ect of a memorandum (see M75-687) from the Secretary to the
Executive Directors dated September 25, 1975.
8.        The program of economic restructuring initiated by the Tanzanian
Government to cope with the economic crisis will generate benefits which
will be spread out in time. Viewed negatively this means that the immediate
barometers of economic health, such as the balance of payments, will remain
weak in the short run. The positive corollary is that Tanzania will have a
basically stronger economy at the end of the restructuring process. The
crisis acted as a catalyst in inducing significant policy shifts which were
diagnosed as necessary beforehand but which did not command urgency until it
struck. Not only did this hasten reallocation in the current Development
Budget and Annual Plan, but it is also likely to have a substantial impact
on the forthcoming Third Five-Year Plan. For the long run the most encouraging
aspect of the Government's response was the demonstration that Tanzania re-
tains the ability to push through necessary but unpopular policy measures
over a wide front. It is this characteristic of a "hard state", together
with the basically sound program of economic restructuring, which holds
promise for the future.
9.        The Tanzanian balance of payments will remain under severe pressure
until more of the favorable balance of payments effects of recent policy
changes can make an impact. Accordingly, Tanzania will require additional
balance of payments assistance in 1976 and 1977. A gap of about $100 million
is anticipated in 1976 after allowance for the balance of the IMF second
credit tranche (paragraph 6 above) has been made. In this connection, a
mission to appraise a proposed second Bank Program Loan is currently in
Tanzania. In addition, a continued'capital inflow in excess of the foreign
exchange component of high priority projects will also be required if Tanzania
is to achieve its development targets. Financing of some local expenditures
will, therefore, be justified.
10.       In terms of debt outstanding and disbursed, the Bank Group is
Tanzania's second largest creditor after the People's Republic of China.
Other major lenders are Sweden, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the
Federal Republic of Germany. The current low overall debt service ratio
of about 7% is expected to rise to aboutll% "y 1980 and remain at about that



- 4 -
level throughout the 1980's. Includinga notional one-third share of the
debt of the East African Community Corporations, the IBRD is presently holding
13% of Tanzania's outstanding external debt and IDA 10%; the IBRD share is
expected to rise to about 23% in the next five years, and IDA share to rise
to about 13%. Debt service payments to the Bank are about 13% of total debt
service payments; the corresponding share for IDA is about 3%. These two
figures are projected to rise to about 25% and 3%, respectively, by 1980.
The debt service ratio of Bank loans to exports is expected to rise to about
2% by 1980. The Bank's exposure is high because several major donors are
now making their aid available either on grant basis or very concessional terms
and because as a result of prudent debt management suppliers' credits have been
kept to a minimum. The average interest rate on loans to Tanzania outstanding
at December 31, 1974 amounted to only 2.4% and the average term was 22 years.
Planning and Implementation
11.       The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development Planning (Devplan)
is the agency in Tanzania with overall responsibility for planning and moni-
toring implementation of the development program. Devplan's role has changed
significantly in recent years particularly following decisions in 1972 to
decentralize the primary responsibility for preparing and implementing devel-
opment plans to the regions, strengthen the capacity of the sectoral minis-
tries to plan and monitor the overall development in the sectors, establish
a Planning Commission to formulate long-term and five-year development plans
and to take steps to improve control of implementation. Devplan's primary
role is one of performing general economic analysis, providing a coordinated
framework within which the regional and sectoral plans can be prepared, pro-
viding support functions and coordinating implementation. Devplan's organi-
zation has recently been changed to strengthen its capacity to carry out
these functions. Emphasis is being given to strengthening its ability to
monitor economic trends and initiate appropriate policies and to coordinate
the translation of the overall five-year plan into annual plans. Devplan
has also established a Programming and Budgeting Control Division to monitor
plan implementation on a much more rigorous basis than has hitherto been
the case. To help the Government in these endeavors, UNDP has recently
approved a project to provide Devplan with one adviser in macro planning,
one in programming and budget control, and two in sectoral planning.
12.       Within the overall framework established by Devplan the sectoral
ministries and the regions have primary responsibility formulating and
implementing the country's development program. The ministries and regions
assume direct responsibility for infrastructure-type projects which do not
earn a commercial return, e.g. roads, and education facilities whereas com-
mercial investments are undertaken by parastatal (nationalized) enterprises
and regional and district development corporations. With the guidance of
their parent ministries and regions these public enterprises have responsi-
bility for drawing up detailed investment proposals and securing financing
for implementation.
13.       The planning and implementation process is carried out within the
framework of five-year and. annual plans. The third five-year plan was due
to commence in July 1975 but in view of the current economic difficulties



-5-
facing the country finalization of the plan has been postponed until the
resource picture becomes clearer. It is not considered that the delay in
the publication of the plan will undermine the planning process. Tanzania's
overall development priorities are clearly defined and are not expected to
change in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile the annual plan for 1975/76 is
now in the process of implementation.
14.       In an attempt to ensure that, within the framework of the planning
process, public enterprises adhere to sound economic and financial invest-
ment criteria, the Government established the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB)
in 1970 and the Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) in 1971 for the indus-
trial and rural sector, respectively. TIB was the recipient of an IDA Credit
of $6 million in 1974 and more recently of a Bank Loan of $15 million approved
in October 1975. Both TIB and TRDB have good senior management and their
staff capacity to review and evaluate projects has grown as a result of
training and as experience has been accumulated. TIB now accounts for about
25% of total industrial investment; virtually all rural credit is channeled
through TRDB. Both TIB and TRDB have experienced problems with their port-
folios. TIB is currently reviewing its problem clients with the intention of
instigating necessary remedial actions. TRDB is improving supervision and
mounting a more intensive loan recovery effort in an attempt to improve its
portfolio.
15.       TIB's Board of Directors includes the principal secretaries to the
Treasury, Devplan and the Ministry of Commerce and Industries as well as the
Chairman of the National Bank of Commerce (Tanzania's nationalized commercial
bank) and the General Manager of the National Insurance Corporation. All
investment proposals must be approved by the Board which among other things
helps to ensure consistency of TIB's portfolio with the country's overall
development priorities. In addition to appraising financing and supervising
investment projects, TIB has established a department with responsibility
for promoting and developing bankable projects. To date this department has
assisted client parastatals in preparing a number of projects, for which TIB
has subsequently extended loan finance. In a further attempt to improve
indigenous project preparation capacity, the Government has also recently
established the Tanzanian Industrial Consultants Organization (TICO). Over
time it is expected that this organization will increasingly assume res-
ponsibility for preparing investment projects in the industrial sector as
it acquires the necessary expertise and gains relevant experience.
16.       As the planning and implementatinn structure described above has
evolved increasing emphasis has been given to plan implementation including
project formulation as well as project execution. Tanzania has consistently
suffered from shortfalls in meeting plan targets especially in the directly
productive sectors (paragraph 5 above); the present planning structure is an
attempt to deal with these issues. In addition to the recently strengthened
Devplan role in plan implementation (paragraph 11 above) and the responsibi-
lities of the TIB and TRDB in this area, the Government has recently announced
the establishment of two additional units designed to help improve plan and
project execution. One unit will be set up in the Treasury Registration
Division to closely monitor parastatal performance which has hitherto been
disappointing in a number of important instauces (paragraph 20 below). In
addition, a Disbursement Unit is being formed in the External Finance Division



- 6 -
of the Treasury to help expedite implementation and disbursements of
foreign aided projects. Although Tanzania has now established a coherent
and rational structure of planning project formulation and implementation,
critical manpower constraints, particularly in the area of project evaluation
and implementation, will continue to limit its overall effectiveness. While
training will provide the solution to these difficulties in the long-term
there will be a continuing need for technical assistance in these areas.
Industry and Mining
17.       The manufacturing sector in Tanzania accounts for only 10% of GNP
but is increasing in importance since independence in 1962, the average
growth rate of value added by the sector has been about 10% per year.
Tanzania has followed a pattern of industrial development concentrating on
establishing or expanding industries for import substitution. Examples
include textile, beer, cigarettes, radios, glass, cement and metal products.
As a consequence of this strategy, imports of consumer goods, in particular,
had been reduced from about 55% of total commodity imports at independence
to a current figure of less that 25%. As the opportunities for import subs-
titution have become exhausted, the Government has been reviewing its indus-
trial development objectives and has now chosen the so-called "basic industrial
strategy".
18.       In essence, the basic strategy aims at a gradual structural trans-
formation of the economy by giving priority to industries that process
domestic raw materials for consumption in the home market and by requiring
that traditional exports are locally processed as far as can be economically
justified. The strategy aims at promoting harmony between the pattern of
production and the pattern of domestic consumption, while the promotion of
new manufactured exports is seen as a logical extension of production for the
home market. The basic industry strategy does not automatically exclude any
project but it does mean that projects that do not fit the underlying philos-
ophy will be expected to earn a higher return than projects that do fit the
philosophy to be eligible for approval by the central planning authorities.
19.       During the past decade new investment in mining has been negligible
but this is rapidly changing. The State Mining Corporation is now beginning
to identify and develop pro:jects for the exploitation of beach sands, phos-
phate, soda ash, gold, and other minerals. Much preparatory work remains to
be done, however. The manpower resources of the Corporation are presently
spread so thinly that it is feared that further progress may be slow unless
there is a significant increase in the level of technical assistance.
20.       The Bank's Industry and Mining Sector mission report, which was
distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1975, raised issues con-
cerning the improvements required in the productivity of existing state
manufacturing enterprises and the need for increasing the efficiency of the
public sector. Rewards for efficiency and penalties for inefficiency within
the parastatal system are at present weak and this is probably one of the



-7-
main reasons for a relatively low level of productivity in many such enter-
prises. The absence of clear and unequivocal performance yardsticks, together
with the introduction of many direct economic controls on the activities of
public and private sector enterprises alike, appears to have had an adverse
effect on the motivation of firm level management in many industries. At
the same time, the Government's task of identifying inefficient operations
has become more complicated as poor economic performance is not necessarily
reflected in a company's profit and loss account or in any other obvious
way. The sector mission recommended thata move away from more comprehensive
controls towards a judicious and selective use of indirect controls, material
incentives and decentralized decision making on the firm level, might well
be compatible with Tanzania's development objectives and at the same time
conducive to greater efficiency and industrial development. As a result of
its concerns relating to these issues, the Government is initiating studies
at both the sector and firm level with a view to formulating detailed recom-
mendations leading to improvements in public and private sector performance.
However, in view of technically complex and unique nature of the issues
involved, the Government will necessarily have to obtain specialist technical
expertise if these tasks are to be satisfactorily accomplished.
21.       There is also the need for the Government to determine the exact
role of the private sector. Since the Arusha Declaration (1967) and the
acquisition by the Government of majority interest in all important manu-
facturing enterprises, mining and financial institutions, most industrial
and mining activity is now in the public sector and all major projects
started after 1967 have been in the public sector. Nevertheless, the con-
tribution of private firms is appreciable and accounts for about 25% of the
value added and 50% of the employment in the sector. At the April 1975
meeting of the Consultative Group on Tanzania, the Government declared its
willingness to participate in joint ventures with foreign private parties
particularly when such cooperative endeavours could give Tanzania access
to needed technical expertise. This could be particularly important in the
mining sector.
Other Sectors
22.       The problems of industrial productivity and efficiency referred
to above apply with equal validity to other sectors. The Government has
initiated studies and actions in these areas with a view to improving per-
formance. Examples include the recent reorganization of the State Trading
Corporation into several smaller units under the Board of Internal Trade and
a study which is currently being instigated to review the problems of the cons-
truction sector and to recommend appropriate policy and institutional changes
and to prepare investment proposals. In the tourism sector there is also a
need to improve the utilization of current facilities before proceeding to
any major investment program. Examples of priority investment programs in
various stages of preparation and implementation in other sectors include
projects in transport and storage to alleviate marketing and distribution
constraints and selected investments in large scale agriculture (e.g. wheat)
to help attain self-sufficiency in food grain production.

PART II - BAkNK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TANZANIA
23.       Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962.    Beginning with
an IDA credit for education in 1963, 20 credits and nine Bank loans amounting
to $314.8 million have so ifar been approved for Tanzania. In addition, Tan-
zania has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totaling $229.8 million, which
have been extended for the development of common services operated regionally
by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their associations in the East African
Community. The only IFC investments in Tanzania to date, totaling $4.7
million, were made in the Kilombero Sugar Company in 1960 and 1964. This
Company encountered financial difficulties and in 1969 IFC and other investors
sold their interest in the Company to the Government. Annex II contains
summary statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Tanzania and the East
African Community organizations as of September 30, 1975 and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
24.       In keeping with Tanzania's overall development strategy our lending
operations are increasingly focusing on the rural sector and directly pro-
ductive projects. Up to the end of FY72 10 out of 14 loans and credits
made directly to Tanzania had been for infrastructure. Of the 11 Tanzania
operations approved since then all but three, Urban Sites and Services
(Credit No. 495 TA), Highway Maintenance (Credit No. 507 TA) and Education IV
(Credit No. 371 TA), were for directly productive projects. These projects
are supporting both the agriculture and industrial sectors including an
Integrated Rural Development Project (Credit No. 508 TA) and our first
direct lending for an industrial project (Mwanza Textiles Loan No.1128 TA).
In addition, a $15 million loan to the Tanzania Investment Bank (paragraphs
14 and 15 above) was recent:Ly approved by the Executive Directors. Projects
to support fisheries development and maize production are expected to be
ready for consideration by the Executive Directors in the near future. A
proposed forestry project and a project to support selected industries and
related estate development at Morogoro have recently been appraised in the
field and a mission appraising a proposed second rural development project
is currently in the field. A third power project and a fifth education
project are expected to presented to the Executive Directors for their
consideration in the near future and a proposed water supply project will
shortly be ready for field appraisal. In view of Tanzania's continuing
balance of payments difficulties a mission appraising a possible second
Program Loan is currently in the field (paragraph 9 above).
25.       WThile it should be borne in mind that over one half of total
Bank Group lending to Tanzania has been approved in the last two fiscal
years and that initial start-up difficulties are perhaps inevitable, the
project implementation difficulties referred to in Annex II of this report
have been greater than anticipated. Some of these problems stem from the
scarcity of suitably trained and qualified manpower, some reflect the
understandable reluctance and apprehension of an essentially conservative
traditional sector to adopt the new "technology" and others are undoubtedly
a reflection of the strains created in a society which is attempting a



- 9-
unique traverse from one set of economic, institutional and political rules
to another. The Government has become extremely conscious of these imple-
mentation issues and is taking steps to resolve these problems.   An earlier
reluctance to recruit technical assistance for planning and implementation
has been replaced by a greater willingness to utilize such assistance when-
ever it is demonstrably necessary. At the request of the Government about
10 technical staff have been supplied by ADS and a Bank staff member has
recently been seconded to the newly established Project Implementation Unit
in the Ministry of Agriculture. In a longer term attempt to alleviate the
human resource constraints our lending is expected to increasingly emphasize
formal and non-formal training. Furthermore, a conscious attempt is being
made to develop more simple and less complex projects.
26.       The difficulties facing the East African Community Corporations
referred to in paragraph 3 above have affected the Bank's lending program
for the Community. The East African Railways Corporation (EARC) has been
the most severely affected. As a result of long delays by the Partner
States in approving increases in tariffs and restrictions on the interstate
transfer of corporate funds, EARC was unable to order essential spare parts
and supplies with the result that its operational capacity has deteriorated
considerably. In July 1974 the Partner States agreed, with Bank assistance,
on a package of financial measures to rehabilitate the EARC including inter-
state transfer of funds and injection of additional capital. However, this
agreement was never fully implemented and as a result disbursements under
Loan No. 674 EA (East African Railways III) were suspended in February 1975.
27.       A Bank mission which visited East Africa in July 1975 was able,
after meeting the Heads of State and other important officials in the three
countries, to bring about an understanding on both the short-and long-term
problems of the East African Community. On the general question of the
future of the EAC, a decision was made to review various aspects of regional
cooperation as now incorporated in the 1967 Treaty. It is anticipated that
this review would begin before the end of the year and take 18-24 months to
complete and would be undertaken by a commission consisting of nominated
representatives from each member country. To address the immediate financial
and managerial problems, that will remain pending the agreement on a long
range reform of the Treaty, the Partner States reached three major accords.
To deal with the transfer problem, an agreement was reached on the mechanism
for the transfer of funds from the regions to the Corporation headquarters.
To ensure a workable plan for railway decentralization, a draft Consultancy
Services Agreement on studying decentralization was adopted and will be
financed under Loan No. 674 EA (the suspension of which has been lifted).
Finally, the Partner States approved the appointement of financial consultants
who will undertake a study of the assets, liabilities, debts and financial
condition of each of the three Corporations on a regional basis. This is
viewed as a necessary step in providing the basis for the decentralization
of the Corporations and is expected to be financed by the UK.



- 10 -
28.       It is expected that this broad agreement between the Partner
States will provide a basis on which the Community can efficiently operate.
Payment for past due loans has been received and all the actions reviewed
above have been initiated. It would, however, be unrealistic to expect
that decentralization of the Community structures will now proceed smoothly
and without difficulties. There are fundamental differences in political
outlook and development strategies between the Partner States and mutual
suspicions of intent will undoubtedly continue. The newly agreed transfer
formula (paragraph 27 above) is inevitably open to misinterpretation and
goodwill will be required on all sides if it is to be successfully im-
plemented. The dangers implicit in the possibility of operating diffi-
culties growing in other Corporations is also recognized. However, a
strong desire to retain control of the situation is also evident. In
addition, a general but genuine commitment to the Community has been noted
in the discussions with the Partner States. The Bank's role as an "honest
broker" has been accepted and endorsed by the Partner States and this role
could be used effectively to help in the smooth transition in the Community's
structure.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
29.       Since independence Tanzania has made impressive efforts to expand
and develop its high level manpower but the country's unique commitment to
development has meant that its scarce human resources have been spread
very thinly. The shortage of experienced people who can formulate and super-
vise the implementation of productive projects, particularly in some of the
highly specialized areas of industry and mining, is critical and has resulted
in the implementation delays referred to in Parts I and II of this report.
These constraints have become particularly acute in light of the current
economic difficulties facing Tanzania and the Government's attempt to shift
the focus of investment to, and increase the efficiency of, directly pro-
ductive programs. The Government has recognized these problems and has been
actively exploring ways in which to increase the level of technical assistance
and to make it more effective in practice.
30.       External financing for technical assistance has grown rapidly during
the last several years in support of the expanding requirements of the Tan-
zanian economy. In calendar 1974 (the last year for which UNDP data are
available) it is estimated that about 750 higher level foreign personnel were
being supported under various assistance programs. About 120 of these experts
were being provided through UNDP and other UN organizations. Sweden, USAID,
Canada, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany
were among the most important bilateral donors.
31.       Despite the large amounts of technical assistance which have been
made available,the need for technical assistance for the implementation of
on-going and the preparation of new progr4-s is likely to exceed the amounts



- 11 -
available for at least the next few years. The overall shortage of technical
skills in Tanzania has meant that much of available bilateral and multi-
lateral assistance is being utilized for high priority needs such as broad
based institutional support rather than for the preparation of new investment
programs and studies designed to improve productive efficiency. For example,
much of available bilateral technical assistance is providing needed medical
personnel in the health sector, teachers and professors in the education
sector and high priority general support for national and regional develop-
ment planning. Even in the directly productive sectors of agriculture and
industry a large proportion of bilateral and multilateral assistance is
being utilized for managerial support for the day to day running of paras-
tatal enterprises, such as finance and accounting, rather than for the pre-
paration and implementation of new investments. Even when bilateral assistance
is being used for these purposes much of it is closely related to on-going
bilateral capital'assistance projects. The fact that this aid tends to be
tied and involves complex and time consuming recruitment procedures, also
tends to limit its usefulness. In a number of cases the Government is left
with little discretion as to the choice of appropriate or suitably qualified
personnel.
32.       Although the available UNDP resources for Tanzania are expected
to increase fairly significantly, the UNDP program is nearly fully com-
mitted for the next few years for on-going or already selected future
projects. It is expected that the Bank Group will continue to provide subs-
tantial amounts of technical assistance on matters closely related to the
projects financed. Such project related Bank assistance has been parti-
cularly important as far as our rural projects are concerned both in terms
of help in project preparation from the Regional Mission in East Africa
and ADS assistance in implementation (paragraph 25 above). However, such
assistance is by its very nature inappropriate for support outside the
framework of project related agencies. In view of the need, discussed in
Part I of this report, to strengthen Tanzania's project preparation capacity
and to identify actions designed to improve the utilization of current invest-
ments coupled with the limited availability, and to some extent ability, of
bilateral assistance to meet these needs, it is thought essential that the
Government have accesses to discretionary and flexible resources to meet
these requirements.
PART IV -  THE PROJECT
33.       A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III. Negotiations
were held in Dar es Salaam in late October 1975. The Tanzanian delegation
was led by Mr. George Mbowe, Chairman and Managing Director, Tanzania Invest-
ment Bank. The project would comprise:
(a) About 80 manyears of consulting services to:
(i) prepare pre-investment studies and feasibility
studies for high priority productive investments
mainly, but not exclusively, in the industrial,
mining, transport and communications sectors; and



- 12 -
(ii) conduct special studies at the sector and firm level.
(b) Overseas training for Tanzanians in project preparation,
evaluation, implementation and related techniques; and
(c) A project unit and related supporting services.
It is expected that the project would be completed in about four years.
The Studies
34.       Given the Government's priorities and the need to improve the
performance of public enterprises in Tanzania, the uses of the proposed
Technical Assistance Credit are expected to be as listed below. The Bank's
Industrial and Mining Sector Survey identified a number of potential invest-
ment projects in the industry and mining sector many of which require further
study. These are summarized in more detail in Annex IV to this report.
(a) Industry
(i) A large number of studies are expected for consumer
industries. The Bank's Industrial and Mining Sector
Survey concluded that perhaps the most pressing need
for production expansion is in the category of con-
sumer goods. Many ordinary manufactured consumer
goods including clothing, cooking oil, sugar, salt,
beer, etc., are frequently in short supply especially
in rural areas. These shortages are of particular
conseciuence since they reduce the incentive value of
higher agricultural producer prices and other measures
the Government is adopting to encourage rural production.
(ii)  Pre-investment studies for intermediate industries
are also expected to be supported under the project.
These will likely include sub-projects in such areas
as tanning, wood processing, textiles, cement, farm
implements and other metal welding industries,
pyrethrum processing, glass holloware and plate
glass, ceramics, electrical products, truck and bus
body manufacturing, tires and tubes, plastics, and
chemicals including industrial alcohol.
(b)  Mining
Several sub--projects are expected to concentrate on the
mining sector. Mining currently contributes only about
two percent of GNP; however, the recent establishment of
the State Mining Corporation, the completion of the TanZam
Railway giving access to important coal and iron reserves



- 13 -
in the south west, the discovery of natural gas off the
coast near Kilwa, and the current emphasis on developing
directly productive projects with positive balance of
payments effects, have combined to result in an increased
emphasis on this hitherto relatively neglected sector
(paragraph 19 above). Rapid development of this sector
will require an especially heavy reliance on technical
assistance. Assistance will be required for the development
of such possible projects as the exploitation of soda ash,
beach sands, gypsum, gemstones, salt and for the preparation
of directly productive investments.
(c) Other Sectors
A number of studies leading to investment projects in other
sectors including transport, communications, construction,
large scale agricultural enterprise, and tourism are also
expected (paragraph 22 above).
(d) Special Studies
A number of special studies at the sectoral and firm level
designed to generate specific recommendations for improve-
ments in efficiency and the utilization of existing invest-
ments are expected. The need for such studies was identified
by the Industrial and Mining Sector mission and is diseussed
in paragraphs 20 to 22 above.
Training
35.       In a long-term attempt to strengthen Tanzania's newly established
plan implementation institutions and structures (paragraphs 11 to 16 above),
provision would be made for about 20 manyears of overseas fellowships for
training in project preparation, evaluation, implementation, management and
related techniques. These fellowships would be made available to suitably
qualified candidates from the national development banks, parastatals and
government agencies. Candidates will likely include employees of the Tan-
zania Industrial Consultants Organization (paragraph 15 above) which is
expected to be able to carry out some of the studies financed under the
project, possibly on a joint venture basis with suitably qualified foreign
consulting firms. The project unit (paragraph 36 below) would prepare a
proposed training program for submission to the Association for review and
comment by June 1976 (Section 2.07(f) draft Project Agreement). It is
expected that the Bank Group's Training Adviser would visit Tanzania prior
to June 30, 1976 to assist in the preparation of the proposed training
program.
Project Organization
36.       In view of the high level manpower constraints in Tanzania and
the lack of experience in executing studies of the type expected to be
supported under the proposed Credit, it is considered essential that adequate



- 14 -
provision be made to both supervise the selection, preparation and
implementation of the studies and to ensure that suitable arrangements to
implement viable projects emerging from the studies are made. In view of
the Tanzania Investment Bank's relevant experience in supporting projects
in the areas in which the studies are expected to concentrate, and the
Government's policy of looking to TIB for guidance in these matters, TIB
would assume overall responsibility for the project (paragraph 14 above).
TIB has been administering a technical assistance fund, now virtually
exhausted, provided by Sweden for similar purposes. TIB's guidelines for
administering this fund are attached as Annex V to this report. These
guidelines would be followed in administering the proposed project.
37.       A project unit would be established as part of TIB's Planning and
Development Department (which is responsible for TIB's current technical
assistance fund) and report to TIB's Director of Planning. The establish-
ment of such a unit is considered necessary in view of the greatly increased
demands which will be placed on the Planning Department by the project.
The unit would be expected to play a major role in identifying high priority
studies, in drafting terms of reference, evaluating proposals by consultants,
negotiating contracts and supervising the studies during implementation.
The unit would be responsible for initiating steps designed to secure finan-
cing for viable projects emerging from the pre-investment and for follow-up
action on recommendations identified in special studies. In general,
attempts would be made to identify potential financiers prior to the com-
mencement of the studies to ensure that any important decisions would be
taken in consultation with the potential financing agencies.
38.       The project unit would comprise an economist/financial analyst, an
engineer, one of whom would be designated as head of the unit, and a lawyer
(part-time) all of whom would be appointed in consultation with the Asso-
ciation (paragraph 1 to Schedule 1 of the draft Project Agreement). Although
the lawyer would perform a crucial role in drawing up consultants' contracts,
he would not be fully employed on project related work. He would, therefore,
be attached to the Tanzania Legal Corporation, which performs all legal
services for parastatals in Tanzania, including TIB, and be available to the
unit when his services were required (paragraph 2 to Schedule 1 of draft
Project Agreement). The Legal Corporation is currently seriously under-
staffed particularly in the area of contract law. Since the role of the unit
is considered crucial to the success of the proposed project it would be a
condition of effectiveness of the Credit that the head of the unit had been
employed (Section 5.01(c) draft Development Credit Agreement). In view of
the broad range of sub-projects expected to be financed by the proposed
project and because the staff of the unit cannot be expected to possess spe-
cialist expertise in all these areas, provision would be made for the project
unit to recruit specific short term technical expertise to help review terms
of reference, preliminary drafts and other documents related to individual
studies. Support services for the project unit including necessary vehicles
and office equipment would be provided.



- 15 -
Procedures for Approval of Studies
39.        Applications for project studies would be submitted by the
parastatals and government departments concerned to TIB. The project unit
would review each proposal which would then be. submitted along with the Unit's
recommendations to TIB's Loan Committee and Board for consideration. In
conducting its review the project unit would assure itself that suitable and
timely finance could not be secured from other multilateral and bilateral
agencies including UNDP. The presence of representatives from the Ministries
of Planning and Finance on TIB's Board (paragraph 15 above) would ensure
consistency with Tanzania's overall development priorities. Any sub-project
expected to cost over $50,000 would be approved by the Association (Section
2.07(e) of the draft Project Agreement).
Channeling of Funds
40.        The proceeds of the Credit would be channeled as a grant by the
Government to TIB under a subsidiary agreement whose terms and conditions
would be acceptable to the Association (Section 3.01(b) of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement). Funds for the studies would be passed on as grants
by TIB to the individual parastatals and government agencies, who would
actually commission the studies and employ the consultants. It is expected
that if and when bankable projects emerged, TIB would, in accordance with the
usual procedures of its technical assistance fund, convert these grants into
loans.
Costs and Financing
41.        The total project cost of $7.5 million (net of taxes), of which
$5.9 million or nearly 80% is expected to be foreign exchange, is made up
as follows:
$ million
Consulting services                      6.2
Overseas fellowships                     0.2
Project unit expenses (including
short-term consulting services,
vehicles and equipment)                1.1
7.5
Further details are given in Annex III.   The proposed Credit would finance
$6 million or 80% of total project costs; the Government, implementing agencies
and TIB would contribute the remaining $1.5 million or 20%. This local con-
tribution, part of which is expected to be in kind, is considered essential
to ensure and evidence the commitment of the commissioning agencies to the
studies supported under the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
42.        In the case of any consultants contract expected to cost in excess
of $50,000 equivalent the selection of consultants and the contracts



- 16 -
to be concluded with them woluld be subject to approval by the Association
(paragraph 6 of Schedule I oE the draft Project Agreement). Contracts for
vehicles and equipment ($100,000) are not expected to attract international
interest and would be placed on the basis of competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Borrower's usual procurement procedures which are satisfactory
to the Association.
43.        The Association would disburse 100% of the foreign costs or 80%
of the total costs of consultancy contracts (including contracts with
project unit experts), 100% cf the foreign costs and 75% of local expend-
itures for overseas training and 100% of the foreign and 75% of local
expenditures for vehicles and equipment.
Benefits and Risks
44.        The technical expertise to be provided under the proposed project
will help alleviate critical manpower bottlenecks. The project will assist
the Government in implementing its program of economic restructuring and in
its efforts to shift the emphasis of the country's investment programs from
infrastructure to more directly productive projects. The special studies
designed to improve the utilization of existing production facilities could
result in significant short- and long-term increases in output. The pro-
posed project is not, however, without risks. Some inappropriate sub-projects
could be selected, others could be poorly executed and supervised and viable
projects emerging from the studies could go unfinanced. The project has
been deliberately designed to be flexible so as to meet Tanzania's changing
needs for pre-investment and special studies; however, this in turn places
considerable responsibility on the Project Implementation Unit.    The calibre
of project unit staff will in large part determine the success of the pro-
ject. Their role in identifying and preparing suitable sub-projects and in
following up financing for viable projects which emerge from the studies
will be crucial. In order to minimize the risks senior project unit staff
would be appointed in consultation with the Association and it would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit that the head of the unit
had been employed (paragraph 38 above). Furthermore, in an attempt to
closely supervise implementation, all studies expected to cost in excess of
$50,000 would be approved by t:he Association (paragraph 39 above).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the United Republic
of Tanzania and the Association and draft Project Agreement between the
Association and the Tanzania Investment Bank, the recommendation of the
Committee referred to in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment of the Association and the draft resolution approving the proposed
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Development Credit and Project Agreements follow the form previously
used for this type of project.
46.        Features of the draft Development Credit and draft Project Agree-
ments of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 35, 38, 39 and 40
of this report. Conditions of Credit effectiveness include (a) that a
subsidiary agreement between the Borrower and TIB, acceptable to the



- 17 -
Association, had been executed (Section 5.01(b), draft Development Credit
Agreement) and (b) that the head of the project unit had been employed
(Section 5.01(c), draft Development Credit Agreement).
47.        I am satisfied that the Credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I,
(As of September 30, 1975)
There are currently 17 projects under execution in Tanzania.
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 217 TA - Tobacco Project: $9.0 million Credit of October 9,
1970; Closing Date - September 30, 1976
As a result of the Tanzania Government's intention to complete
its villagization program by 1976, the process has been accelerated and
a total of about 7,200 families have been moved to villages in the
tobacco complexes, bringing the number of project farmers to 10,000.
As a result of these vigorous efforts, it is now likely that the appraisal
target of 15,000 farmers will be reached in 1975. Strict measures to
enforce minimum tobacco acreages per family are expected to contribute to
increased tobacco production. However, yields per hectare and quality of
leaf have been below anticipated levels. Improvements are required to
strengthen the extension and cooperative services. Provision of water
supplies and social infrastructure is progressing well.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 million Credit of
March 3, 1972; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
After initial serious management problems the Tanzania Tea
Authority (TTA) has now finally reached a satisfactory level of senior
staffing and this has had a clear impact on the working of TTA and a
definite improvement in the control over the field activities. The
completion of 956 ha of new planting during 1974/75 brings the total
project planting to 5,086 ha or 61% of the total target area. A further
500 ha is planned for 1975/76 season. The past lack of technical,
administrative and financial control over the four widely dispersed project
areas is reflected in TTA's current financial problems. A special super-
vision mission has been scheduled to examine these problems and propose
remedial measures.
1/    These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in par-
ticular, to report any problems which are being encountered,
and the actions being taken to remedy themn. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project executien.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 9
Credit No. 382 TA - Second Livestock Development Project: $18.5
million Credit of May 23, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 1977
The credit was declared effective on September 28, 1973 but so
far implementation has been extremely slow. IDA disbursements to date
have been limited to technical services and it is only during the past
half year that the development of cattle ranching and marketing has
started to get underway.   The meat processing component of the project
was recently scaled down by almost a third of appraisal proposals because
of increass in cost. However, overall progress should improve now that
responsibility for project implementation has been transferred to the
newly established Livestock Development Authority and construction of the
meat processing plants is underway.
Credit No. 454 TA - Geita Cotton Project: $17.5 million Credit of
January 17, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1982
The conditions in which the project is operating were radically
changed by the 1974 decision that farmers throughout the district should
move into villages and by relative price changes in the producer prices
for maize and cotton which occurred in 1974 and 1975. In addition management
problems have slowed project implementation. For the 1975/76 cropping
season the project is focusing on twenty selected villages.
Loan No. 1014 TA - Cashewnut Development Project: $21.0 million
Loan of June 24, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1981
The lowest bids for the five processing facilities to be
constructed under the project were considerably in excess of the appraisal
estimate for the project component. Following detailed discussions
between the Government and contractor, the cost was considerably reduced
by deletion of non-essential items. Construction of the processing facili-
ties is proceeding well.
Credit No. 508 TA - Kigoma Rural Development Project: $10.0 million
Credit of August 21, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1980
The credit became effective in November 1974.   By July 1975
progress on the project appeared to be generally satisfactory. All staff
to be posted under the Project Management Executive (PME) had been
appointed. Planning of project villages had begun through the preparation
of viability reports (VSFR's) and land-use maps based on recent aerial
photographs. A first training seminar of one month had been given to
village-level bookkeepers in a new simplified bookkeeping system. Condi-
tions were therefore such that the last supervision mission could agree to
inclusion of 23 villages for project financing during the current fiscal
year, requiring investments of TSh 4.9 million for agricultural inputs
and TSh 5.6 million for social infrastructure. Progress on this proposed
investment program would depend particularly on project organization and
management. However, the institutional arrangements following elimination



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 9
of the Kigoma Cooperative Union (KCU) still remained unsatisfactory. It is
anticipated that the supervision mission scheduled in December will be able to
resolve this issue. A preparation team, eventually to number four full-time
expatriates, was recently installed in Mwanza to prepare integrated rural
development projects for Mwanza and Shinyanga Regions, and the existing
and future information base and supporting activities appear promising.
Credit No. 513 TA and Loan No. 1041 TA - Kilombero Sugar Development
Project: $9.0 million Credit and $9.0 million loan of September 27,
1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1979
Estate field development is ahead of schedule with 2,740 ac of
sugar cane planted during 1974/75 (about 500 ac over the target) outgrowers
planting of 400 ac is about 200 ac behind schedule. Construction of the
new sugar mill, financed by Dutch and Danish loans, is on schedule and
should be completed by July 1976. Procurement of field machinery and
equipment and supporting project activities are progressing reasonably well.
Due to cost escalation of the housing and community development component,
detailed cost reviews were undertaken and the project management expects
that the anticipated cost overruns of about TSh 21.5 million (US$ 3 million)
will be offset by savings on other components and by partial lowering of
standards.
Credit No. 580 TA - Dairy Development Project: $10.0 million Credit of
August 15, 1975; Closing Date - April 30, 1981
The credit is not yet effective. The Government is proceeding
with the recruitment of key personnel.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149 TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 million Credit
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Most project schools are completed. Schools are adequately
furnished but not yet fully equipped. Procurement and installation of the
remaining furniture and equipment is in progress. The project has experienced
a minor overrun of $0.4 million.
Credit No. 232 TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 million Credit of
February 5, 1971; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
Construction on all 13 project sites is in progress, seven project
institutions are almost completed, three will be completed by October 1975
and the remaining three by December 1975. The Government has agreed to
start construction on boarding facilities with an estimated completion date
of September 1976. All furniture and equipment contracts have been awarded,
but the four agricultural education specialists have not vetbeen recruited.



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 9
Fellowship training is satisfactory, two have already returned and taken
up their duties. Disbursements have increased substantially but as a
result of the start up problem the Closing Date of the project has been
extended for 18 months, up to December 31, 1976. A cost overrun of
about $1.6 million is expected.
Credit No.. 371 TA - Fourth Education Project: $10.3 million Credit of
April 13, 1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
Design work of all project institutions, except for the three
secondary schools eliminated because of cost overruns, will be completed
by the end of 1975. Out of 18 project institutions construction works had
started on eight sites only. All construction work is scheduled to be
completed in the beginning of 1978. Furniture and equipment lists should
be completed for tender by the end of 1975. The project unit is now
working satisfactorily and a new project coordinator has been appointed
by the Government. Estimated project cost, prepared last May by the pro-
ject unit, same to about US$22 million, excluding the three secondary
schools, a cost overrun of about 15%. While disbursements are expected
to increase substantially it is likely that the Closing Date will have to
be extended until the end of 1978.

Potential Investment Projects in the Industrial and Mining
Sectors Identified in the Bank's Industrial and Mining Sector
Survey on Tanzania, Dated March 31, 1975
The Bank's industrial and mining sector mission, which visited
Tanzania in September 1974, identified a number of projects in the industrial
and mining sector. These projects are in various stages of identification
and preparation and many will require a considerable input of technical
assistance if they are to materialize as viable projects. The list prepared
by the mission and summarized below is not exhaustive and will be the subject
of continuous review by the Government and its agencies in the light of new
information becoming available and changing circumstances.
(a)  Industry
Steel mill. Tanzania is planning to build an integrated iron and steel
mill based on domestic iron ore and coal reserves. The Government has
not so far announced any details on the production technology, on the
size of the mill or on the timing, but it is understood that the target
date for completion is 1980 or shortly thereafter. If this project
materializes it will have immediate relevance to the further develop-
ment of the engineering sector.
Steel scrap melting and billet casting. Estimated investment require-
ments for two possible scrap mills (Tanga and Dar es Salaam) are
US$4 million.
Textile mills. The Government's plan for the next five years includes
a relatively modest expansion of four existing mills, the doubling of
another existing mill (Mwanza) and the establishment of one major new
integrated mill. The industry mission argued that a cotton/polyester
blended fabrics plant should be considered as an alternative for an
all-cotton millwhich is presently planned f'or Musoma. Total-investment
requirements are estimated at US$90-140 miliion depending on the project
choice.
Morogoro Complex. This is a multiple industry project proposed for
Morogoro including a tannery, a canvas mill., a shoe factory, a leather
goods factory and an industrial estate catering to the needs of smaller
product-related enterprises. Total investment required is estimated at
around US$65 million.
Other tanneries and leather processing industries. The existing tannery
in Moshi is being expanded and the establishment of a new one at Mwanza
is planned. The object of these and the proposed Morogoro tannery
project is to process all hides and skins domestically before export
(or local manufacturing).
Wood projects. NDC is working on a pulp and paper project (import
substitution) which is in an advanced stage of preparation. Investment



Annex IV
Page 2 of 4
costs are estimated at around US$150 million. The Tanzania Wood
Industries Corporation is preparing or has identified various sawmilling
and wood processing projects (including plywood, soft board, block board,
furniture, pencil and ruler, brush and broom and pre-fabricated wooden
houses) totaling US$20 million.
Farm implements. De-bottlenecking of the existing plant in Dar es
Salaam and construction of a second factory (in Mbeya) is planned. The
existing factory is working at 30% of capacity but even at full capacity
it could only supply about 50% of local demand. Investments required
are estimated at US$7 million.
Pyrethrum.  A second pyrethrum factory is planned (at Mbeya) and costs
are estimated at US$3 million.
Plastic products. An expansion of PVC pipe extruding capacity is
required in connection with the Government's massive rural water scheme.
No preliminary cost estimates are available but investment require-
ments are probably at least US$2-3 million. Capacity expansion for a
range of other plastic products is also being planned and costs are
estimated at US$2 million.
Asbestos cement. A project for a US$2 million plant for pipes and
sheets is planned.
Glass hollow ware and plate glass. Expansion of glass bottle and other
hollow ware manufacturing capacity is needed to achieve and maintain
self-sufficiency. Tanzania could conceivably become an efficient
producer and exporter of plate glass to other East African countries.
Aluminum and metal fabrication. An expansion of the Alaf facilities
in Dar es Salaam is being planned in connection with the Government's
acquisition of a majority interest in the company. This and other
metal fabrication projects including a machine tool project are ten-
tatively costed at US$34 million.
Cashew processing. A major program for the expansion of existing
facilities and erection of five new factories is already underway.
Total investment involved is estimated at about US$40 million. Several
further projects are being considered.
Beer brewing. About US$40 million would be required for a proposed new
brewery in Mwanza, US$15 million for a proposed malting plant and
another US$15 million for the expansion of existing brewing facilities.
Coffee curing. A major expansion and improvement of storage facilities
of the coffee curing works at Moshi, costing approximately US$2 million
will be undertaken.



Annex IV
Page 3 of 4
Other food. An estimated US$100 million will be required for additional
grain milling capacity, bakeries, soft drinks, dairies, slaughter faci-
lities, meat canning, fruit canning, vegetable oil production, fish
processing, salt refin:Lp, etc.   Many projects are currently being or are
about to be prepared.
Clothing. The knitting and garment industry is still predominantly
controlled by the private sector. There is considerable scope for
further import substituation and growth with demand.
Paper and printing. Projects for the expansion of paper-converting
capacity and used-paper recycling are being prepared and identified
and so is another project to expand printing capacity for school books,
etc. Investment requirements are estimated at US$6 million.
Fertilizers.  A small expansion project (US$4 million) that would raise
capacity of the existing plant by 30-40% is pLanned.
Tires. An expansion of the existing tire factory costing US$7 million
is planned.
Miscellaneous, including ceramics, bicycle tires and tubes, civil
explosives, industrial alcohol, paints, basic industrial chemicals.
Several projects in these fields are in different stages of preparation
and identification. The ceramics and alcohol projects are of particular
interest as they would be using local inputs, namely, Pugu Hill kaolin
and molasses produced by the sugar factories.
Machinery other than electric. The local manufacture of a range of
pumps and pipe fittings for water supply systems should, in view of
the Industry mission, be well within the capability of the National
Engineering Company. The manufacture of transmission shafts, cranks,
pulleys and simple construction and loading machinery such as wheel
barrows, concrete mixers and conveyors should also be actively explored.
The local manufacture of small internal combustion engines and spare
parts for static operation (e.g. for spray units, compressors and
electricity generation) could provide a basis for the manufacture of
motor cycles later on.
Transport equipment. The Industry mission concluded that the local
manufacture of all truck, bus and trailer bodies (instead of importing
fully assembled units) should be the ultimate aim of a strategy that
would start with the assembly of all such vehicles. It would be based
on a phased program of import substitution. Another important project
possibility is the manufacture of railway freight cars, or at least
the bodies initially.
Fabricated metal products. The Industry mission concluded that the
manufacture of locks, padlocks, hinges and catches is technically
feasible and economically Justified.   This would also help in building



Annex IV
Page 4 of 4
up a small press tool making industry. The manufacture of a range of
finished structural parts of steel and cast iron foundry products
such as manhole covers, pipes and all sorts of fittings should also
be considered. Practically all fabricated metal parts on trucks and
buses such as exhaust pipes, silencer systems, brackets, radiators,
springs and steel pressed pulleys could also be made locally. There
is no reason why Tanzania could not be self-sufficient in metal household
buckets and similar containers.
Electrical sector. An obvious possibility is the local manufacture of
motor vehicle batteries. It should also be possible to start the local
manufacture of small electric motors, sizes and types of which would
have to be determined by a detailed market survey.
(b) Mining
Cement. A cement expansion program aimed at tripling production
capacity from 340,000 to 1,000,000 tons per annum is being prepared
and part of it is already under implementation. Implementation require-
ments are estimated at US$75 million.
Gold. A number of prospects are being reexamined.
Phosphate. This mineral occurs at Minjingu on the east shore of
Lake Manyara. Possible plans, which could lead to further studies,
designed to determine how this deposit may be most economically exploited
are currently under consideration.
Coal. There are several possibilities for the exploitation of Tanzania's
very substantial coal reserves located in the southwestern corner of
the country near Mbeya. The completion of the Tan-Zam railway has
opened up the prospect of utilizing this previously inaccessible resource.
Beach sands. The Beach Sands Mining Co., Ltd. was formed in 1973 to
investigate the possibility of exploiting the coastal beach sands of
Tanzania. The coastal area has been extensively investigated and at
least four areas of sand with a heavy mineral content have been identified.
Natural gas.  A recent gas strike has been made of the coast about 200 kms.
south of Dar3es Salaam. Estimates of the reserves range between 16 and
42 billion m . Tanzania's capacity to identify and compare the relative
merits of alternative uses for the natural gas is very limited and the
Industry mission recommended that high level technical assistance be
sought before any decision regarding exploitation is made.
Soda ash. A detailed pre-feasibility study for a project to exploit
the soda ash of Lake Natron has recently been prepared by a Japanese
interest. Further steps are currently being taken to determine the
economic potential of such a project and to identify required further
studies which could involve a substantial amount of technical assistance.
Other possible mining projects. Several other potential projects for
the exploitation of tin, gypsum, -emstones, diamonds, salt, magnisite,
nickel, sand and kaolin are in various stages of identification
and are expected to require considerable further study.
