APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Yemen Arab Republic (Yemen) is one of the most densely populated
parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Its economy is based mainly on agricultural
production. To ensure the economic growth of the country the transport
system should be improved. Ports in Hodeidah, Salif and Mocha have the
physical capacity to handle present maritime transport and can be extended
if necessary. A United Nations Development Programme financed study, for
which the Bank is Executing Agency, is currently being undertaken to deter-
mine the policy of port development. Airports in Sana'a, Hodeidah and Taiz
service the international and domestic passengers traffic and airfreight.
Inland transportation is based on a highway network which is still in an early
stage of development.
ii.       The modernization of highways in Yemen started about 17 years ago.
Since then about 930 km of roads, and many streets in Sana'a, Hodeidah, Taiz
and Ibb were paved, and several hundred km of feeder roads were upgraded.
Present plans envisage an increased rate of construction of paved main and
secondary roads, and gravel feeder roads. The first main road projects were
carried out under bilateral assistance of the People's Republic of China,
United States Agency for International Development, Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, and Federal Republic of Germany. In 1970 the Government of Yemen
requested the Association for assistance in developing its highway network.
Following this request, an Investment Feasibility Study for Roads, financed
by the United Nations Development Programme with the Associaton as Executing
Agency, was carried out by the Swedish Consultants Group, SWECO, in 1971. A
preliminary investment program for 1972-79 was prepared, listing over a
thousand km of priority roads and recommending assistance to organize the
Highway Authority (HA). This led up to the First Highway Project (FHP) fi-
nanced by IDA Credit 315-YAR of US$7.7 million effective January 15, 1973,
and by a Kuwait Fund soft-term loan of US$0.8 million. The project included
construction of the Taiz-Turba road, (by HA force account), feasibility
studies and detailed engineering of roads, technical assistance to HA, and
purchase of equipment. After serious early delays project implementation
has significantly improved, and it is scheduled for completion in 1977.
iii.      The proposed project is a follow-up of the FHP.  It consists of
construction and supervision of the Taiz-Km 64 road and continuation of
technical assistance for two years. The project road is one of the highest
priority roads to evolve from FHP studies, and would complete the paved high-
way from Taiz to Hodeidah and provide an improved link to Mocha. The traffic
density is now about 500 vehicles per day with an estimated growth rate of
about 7% p.a. over next 20 years. Based on vehicle operating cost savings,
the economic return has been estimated about 14%, with a first year benefit
of about 10%.



- ii -
iv.       HA has adequate production capacity for its present program but
lacks expertise in administration, planning and some engineering areas. To
strengthen HA organization, the proposed project includes the continuation
from the FHP of technical assistance for two years, providing about 120 man-
months of consulting services.
v.        The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$15.7 mil-
lion, with a foreign exchange component of US$9.8 million or 62%. The cost
estimate of road construction is based on the most advantageous bid received
following international competitive bidding, with a 7.5% preference for do-
mestic contractors, which was carried out in May, 1975. The cost of consult-
ing services is based on man-months required and on the present cost of
similar services in the area. Road construction, estimated at US$13.95 mil-
lion, would be by contract. The supervision of works, estimated at US$0.57
million, would be by consultants. Technical assistance, estimated at US$1.18
million, is expected to be provided by the consultants, appointed under the
FHP.
vi.       The project will be financed by an IDA credit of US$9.0 million,
which will cover 100% of foreign costs of consulting services for supervision
of works and technical assistance, and about 54% of the cost of road construc-
tion. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has indicated that it
will provide a loan of US$5.0 million for a period of 40 years including a
grace period of 10 years at an interest rate of 1-1/2% and an agreement was
reached to use the proceeds of this loan to cover local costs of consulting
services and about 34% of the cost of construction, while the Government will
provide US$1.7 million covering the remaining 12% of the cost of construction.
vii.      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an Association
Credit of US$9.0 million equivalent to Yemen.



APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Yemen Arab Republic (Yemen) has requested the
Association's assistance in financing a highway project comprising construc-
tion of Taiz-Km 64 road (Hodeidah turn-off), and technical assistance to the
Highway Authority (HA).  This project would be a follow-up of the First High-
way Project (FHP), (Credit 315-YAR) which became effective on January 15,
1973.  After earlier serious delays, due to the receipt of unacceptable bids
for the Taiz-Turba road construction, the first project is now progressing
satisfactorily.  Details of the first project are given in Annex A.
1.02      The Government has formulated a broad highway development program
based on the recommendations of the Investment Feasibility Study for Roads
(IFS) financed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and carried
out in 1971 by the Swedish Consulting Group (SWECO). The proposed project
road is a part of this program and its construction would be concurrent with
the realization of other program roads under financing from other sources.
The project is in line with the IDA lending strategy for Yemen, adequate
roads being indispensable for development of agriculture, which is the
mainstay of national economy.
1.03      This report is based on the detailed engineering prepared by the
consultant, Ingeroute/Gibb (France/UK), under FHP and the findings of the
appraisal mission to Yemen in December 1974, consisting of Messrs. W.
Sikorski (Engineer) and A. Ramuglia (Economist).
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   The Country and Its Economy
2.01      Yemen occupies about 195,000 km2 of largely mountainous terrain in
the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula. To the north and east the
country borders Saudi Arabia, to the south the People's Democratic Republic
of Yemen, and on the west the Red Sea.
2.02      The country, geographically and climatically, consists of five
major zones. Along the 420 kr. Red Sea coast lies the Tihama, a roughly 65
km wide arid and hot sandy plain, with rainfall averaging about 130 mm per
year. Agriculture depends on irrigation and is concentrated ii. the eight
major wadis of the Tihama. Groundwater is extensively utilized and main-
tenance of a substantial level of production will depend on its long-term
availability. All the cotton and much of the marketed grain (largely
sorghum or durra) is produced in the Tihama.



-2-
2.03      Behind the Tihama a tilted plateau rises up to the interior of the
country. These Western Slopes cccupy the area between the coastal and moun-
tain plains at elevations up to about 1000 m. Here livestock is raised, and
fruit, vegetables, cereals, coffee and qat are cultivated on terrac~ed fields.
2.04      The Western Slopes lead to the Midlands, an area of deep ravines
and steep ridges between altitudes of 1,000 m and 2,500 m, with a rainfall
up to 700 mm per year. This is the most productive agricultural area in
Yemen. Besides sorghum and millet, fruits, such as bananas and papayas,
qat, vegetables and coffee are grown.
2.05      The Highlands, situated above 2,500 m, produce wheat, barley,
sorghum and provide grazing. Towards Yemen's eastern border the mountains
taper to hills and the hills fade into the large sand desert, the Rub al-
Khali or Empty Quarter. The slopes were in the distant past agriculturally
productive, but this is no longer the case.
2.06      Overall agriculture remains the major economic activity in Yemen,
accounting for about two-thirds of the GDP and providing employment for
about 80% of the labor force. The majority of the farmers own some land
but holdings are small and most of the cultivable land is owned by state or
religious trusts and large individual ownerships.
2.07      Yemen's known non-agricultural resources are limited.  Except for
rock salt, no minerals are now being exploited. Forestry and fishing may
have some potential for future development but are now of little economic
importance. Local handicrafts are still the main form of industry with
weaving, tanning, dyeing and food processing pursued in the old, traditional
ways, with little use of mechanical power and only a few small factories.
B.   The Transport System
2.08      Until the late 1950's, modern transport infrastructure was almost
completely lacking in Yemen. Primitive tracks, suitable only for four-wheel
drive vehicles and animal transport connected major towns and were the only
means of land transport. Port facilities were limited to the ancient port
of Mocha, now suitable only for lighterage, and there was no air service
within the country. Toward the end of the decade bilateral assistance, on
a project by project basis, began to assemble a modern transport system.
A new port at Hodeidah, financed by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
(USSR) was completed in 1960; an international airport was built in Sana'a
with the aid of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG); bitumen surfaced roads
from Hodeidah to Sana'a and a road junction 64 km west of Taiz, and gravel
road Sana'a-Taiz-Mocha were constructed between 1957 and 1970, financed by
the People's Republic of China (I'RC), the USSR, and the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID). The FRG is now financing the pavement
of the Sana'a-Taiz road.



- 3-
(a)  Highways
2.09      The highway sector is discussed in Chapter III.
(b)  Ports
2.10      Most of Yemen's international trade moves through the port of
Hodeidah, the country's only deep water general cargo port. Hodeidah is
badly congested, primarily because of poorly organized and inefficient
operations. The USSR has made a commitment to finance the enlargement of
the port. The other deep water port in Yemen is Salif which is specialized
for rock salt export with almost none of the facilities necessary for
handling general cargo. The Kuwait Fund is financing an expansion of the
specialized facilities for handling the salt export at Salif, including a
new deep water pier. The port of Mocha is now almost completely silted up,
suitable only for shallow lighterage, and ordinarily is visited by few ships
although congestion at Hodeidah has resulted in a temporary increase in ac-
tivity. A UNDP and Kuwait Fund financed Study of Port Development in Yemen
will make an analysis of both investment in facilities and possible organi-
zational and operating improvements of Yemen's ports.
(c) Civil Aviation
2.11      Three airports, at Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah, service domestic and
international air travel, and air strips at Saadah and Berat provide for
domestic service vin the north. Sana'a has a new and adequate terminal, but
is not equipped for night landings. Neither are the other airports. Yemen
Airways, the national carrier owned by the Government, has a fleet of four
DC-3's and three DC-6B's, not all of which are regularly in operating con-
dition. It also has one two-engine jet on "wet" lease (everything, including
crew, provided).
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
2.12      Yemen is still in an early stage of development.  Although remark-
able progress has been made in the last decade, Yemen still lacks a compre-
hensive economic development plan and has only marginal capacity in identi-
fication and preparation of investment projects in terms of economic justi-
ficatiQn and financial feasibility. No overall transport planning exists at
present either in the Central Planning Organization (CPO) which is responsible
for national economic planning, or in the ministries concerned. Transport
investments have been made on a project basis with the determining factor
being the availability of foreign aid. However, a team of experts, financed
by the Bank and the Kuwait Fund, has been attached to the CPO since October
1971 to help with overall economic planning, identification and preparation
of investment projects and coordination of external assistance, and has been
instrumental in identifying a number of development projects.



- 4s -
2.13      Virtually all of Yemen's capital development is financed by foreign
aid. Out of the 'total development expenditures scheduled for the current
Development Program (1973/74-1975/76) of about US$208 million, US$65 million
or 31% have been allocated to the transport and communications sector, with
the major part of the transport investment going into highways.
D.   Previous Projects in the Transport Sector
2.14      The Bank is financing, under IDA Credit 315-YAR, a highway project
consisting of construction and supervision of the Taiz-Turba road, feasibility
studies and detailed engineering of some priority roads, purchase of spare
parts and equipment, technical assistance to the HA, and training of HA staff.
The estimated cost of this project, which is the first Bank Group lending in
Yemen since it became a member in May 1970, was $8.6 million and the IDA
Credit $7.7 million. The Kuwait Fund is co-financing the project by a soft
term loan of US$0.8 million. After serious initial delays project implementa-
tion is now satisfactory. The Credit, and its present status, is detailed in
Annex A.
III. THE HIGHWAYS
A.   The Network
3.01      The highway network totalLing about 3,670 km is not classified
officially. However, it is customary to refer to some roads as main roads,
and to others as secondary or feeder roads.  There are about 1,370 km of main
roads and about 2,300 km of secondary and feeder roads. About 930 km of
roads are paved, and a further 200 km are under construction to paved stand-
ards. Gravel and earth roads total 1,460 km and unimproved tracks about
1,080 km. The latter are generally old trails adapted to motor traffic by
rough improvement of more difficult sections. (See Table 1 and Map).
3.02      The highway development was initiated in 1957 under bilateral aid
received since from the PRC, US, USSR and FDR. In 1972 the Association
provided financing for construction of the Taiz-Turba road under the FHP.
Several projects are completed and some are still in progress. Details are
shown in Table 2. Construction and improvement of feeder roads is proceeding
concurrently under schemes initiated and financed by local authorities and
cooperatives with assistance of the World Food Program (WFP), and within
various agricultural projects.
3.03      The Government formulated .a fairly large program of paved roads
construction including about 960 km of main and secondary roads. Feasibility
studies and detailed engineering for some of the program roads have been
carried out under FHP (Taiz-km 64 and Damar-Rada'a roads). Other studies have
been carried out under UNDP projects and various bilateral sources.  The
Government is already seeking financing of construction, and has obtained
assurances for some of the roads from various sources. The construction of
Taiz-Km 64 road is included in the proposed project. Details of the program
are shown in Table 3.



-5-
B.   Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
3.04      Statistics on the highway sector remain sparse and reliable trend
data on vehicle registration, fuel consumption, commodities hauled, or length
of haul is not available on a national basis. In 1971 the Government pub-
lished the firs.t statistics on registered motor vehicles for four of the then
eight (now ten) provinces which showed a total of 9,523 vehicles. By the end
of 1973 there was a total of 18,637 motor vehicles reported registered in the
same four major provinces. Details of the growth of the vehicle fleet are
shown in Table 4.
3.05      No regular traffic counts have been taken in Yemen.  Such counts as
do exist were first made for individual road projects. The first origin and
destination survey ever taken in Yemen was made in connection with the fea-
sibility studies financed under the FHP. This, however, was limited in scope
and time.
3.06      With the aid of technical assistance under the FHP, a traffic count-
ing program was planned and started on all major roads and those roads provi-
sionally included in the Government's proposed feeder road construction prog-
ram. Assistance with the program would continue under the proposed project.
3.07      Presently few regulations govern higlway traffic although registra-
tion of vehicles and licensing of drivers are required. However, both are
poorly organized, and there is no legislation controlling vehicles' weights
or dimensions. The FHP technical assistance prepared recommendations for
proposed legislation to control vehicle weights and dimensions. Assistance
with implementation is also included in the FHP services and would be con-
tinued under the proposed project.
C.   Administration
3.08      Two Ministries are responsible for the highway network:  Ministry of
Development (MD) and Ministry of Public Works (MPW). The former is responsi-
ble for the formulation of programs and financing, while the latter for the
implementation of projects and highway administration. The executing agency
is the HA, an agency established by the Presidential Council decree in
November 1972 (Annex B), replacing the General Corporation for Construction
and Development (GCCD), which carried out highway works and public building
construction.
3.09      The HA is an autonomous organization, which was initially under the
auspices of the MD, and since April 1975 was transferred to the MPW. The HA
is controlled by a Board of Directors, which approves HA budget, formulates
its policies and supervises their implementation. HA duties comprise highway
planning, design, construction, maintenance, supervision of contracts and
execution of works (on a contractual basis) for local authorities and other
entities. It has its own capital, the main assets being road equipment and



-6-
buildings taken over from the GCDD. It is subdivided in three divisions:
Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeida, with the headquarters in Sana'a.  The HA organiza-
tion is shown in the Chart.
3.10      The HA took over from the GCCD a considerable amount of road equip-
ment and the workshops left on the completion of the Sana'a-Hodeidah and
Sana'a-Taiz-Mocha roads. Most of this equipment was nearly worn out on the
projects' work, and at present only about 25% is still in service. However
purchases under the FHP (US$0.7 inillion), HA budgets (about US$1.5 million)
and for the force account construction of Taiz-Turba road (about US$1.3 mil-
lion) will provide HA with adequate equipment for the work program (Table 5).
3.11      The two main workshops, in Hodeidah and Taiz, are fairly well
equipped while the main workshop in Sana'a is in the process of organization
and needs some new buildings. The related costs will be met from the HA
budget. Assistance to improve organization, spare parts procurement, equip-
ment repairs and training of personnel is being provided by the UNDP voca-
tional training project (para 3.26), and under technical assistance included
in the first and the proposed highway projects.
3.12      The HA employs about 800 permanent staff.  There are sufficient
lower grade technicians, mechanics and operators, but a shortage of hi-hway
and mechanical engineers: of the 12 university graduates in service, only 4
are civil engineers, while others are architects and surveyors. The tech-
nical assistance provided under EIHP, and to be continued under the proposed
project, would help to strengthen and improve the HA organization. However,
ultimately an adequately staffed HA is dependent on satisfactory Government
support (para. 3.18).
D.   Planning
3.13      The planning of highway development is the responsibility of the
MD, within which it is carried out by the CPO. The MD determines the priori-
ties for highway projects and financing of their implementation. The formula-
tion of detailed highway development programs is the duty of the HA. The
technical assistance consultants provide assistance to HA in this field.
3.14      In 1971 SWECO carried out the IFS financed by the UNDP, with the
Bank aating as Executing Agency. SWECO proposed a program of highway in-
vestment for 1972-79 totalling about 1,400 km. Although this investment
program was prepared using limited traffic data and a summary economic analy-
sis, it provided sufficient basis for determining priorities. The Government
road construction program includes about 70% of the roads proposed by the IFS.
With detailed advice provided by the technical assistance consultants, the
HA should shortly be in a better position to satisfactorily update and con-
tribute to the realization of this program.

3.15      Major highway construction is financed mainly by bilateral assis-
tance and to a small extent by the Association (see Tables 2 and 3). Most of
the feasibility studies and detailed engineering, training, technical assist-
ance and equipment have been financed by UNDP and the Association. The Gov-
ernment's development budgets cover a part of local costs for the Association
and UNDP projects, and some project preparation studies.
3.16      The construction of feeder roads is financed mainly by local author-
ities and cooperatives, with help from the WFP. In 1970/71 the WFP project
contributed food commodities estimated at US$0.6 million for construction of
about 300 km of feeder roads. An expansion of this project for a five-year
period was requested by the Government and is being processed by the WFP.
Construction of some feeder roads is also included in the IDA financed Tihama
Development project and the Southern Uplands Rural Development project.
3.17      The financing of the HA is the responsibility of the Government and
should be included in the annual budgets. Due to the financial constraints
such budgetary allocations have been till now below the amounts required. The
effective operatioh of HA in areas of highway administration and road main-
tenance is hindered by this situation particularly by the related financial
uncertainties which makes the setting up of a sound basic staff structure and
work program difficult. To maintain a viable basic organization HA presently
undertakes works for local authorities (such as street construction) by con-
tract.
3.18      During credit negotiations the Government assured that it will:
ensure adequate financing of the HA to cover the cost of highway administra-
tion, road maintenance and road improvement works ordered by the Government;
prepare within 8 months of credit effectiveness, for discussion with the Asso-
ciation, the HA related work program for a period of not less than three year;
and arrange for consultation with the Association on the annual work program
of the HA prior to the preparation of its annual budgets.
F.   Engineering
3.19      The detailed engineering for construction of paved roads is carried
out either directly by the country financing the construction (PRC, USSR), or
by consultants (FRG, IDA, OPEC countries). The consultants are remunerat-
ed either from the project funds or from other sources arranged by the Gov-
ernment. There are currently two consulting firms employed on detailed
engineering: SWECO on the Sana'a-Marib road and Ingeroute-Gibb on the Rada'a-
Al Beida road.
3.20      Highway design standards have mostly been determined on a project
basis. The Fill' technical assistance is preparing general standards. During
credit negotiations the Government gave assurances that it will within 12
months of Credit effectiveness establish highway design standards, which
would be satisfactory to the Association.



-8-
3.21      HA has limited capacity to carry out highway design work.  Feeder
roads are built usually following existing trails and tracks, with limited
improvement to horizontal and vertical alignment, generally decided on the
spot by the technicians in charge of construction. Such solutions are ade-
quate on a short-term basis. Thie technical assistance presently under FHP and
to be continued under the proposed project provides design expertise, but
adequate design capacity will evolve only from a strengthened HA staff struc-
ture (para 3.12).
G.   Construction
3.22      The construction methods on highway projects in Yemen differ, de-
pending on the usual procedures of the financing country. The PRC, USSR and
USAID use, or used, force account method with their own management, technicians
and essential skilled labor. The PRC projects tend to be labor intensive,
while the USSR and USAID projects were more equipment intensive. The USAID
procedure used less expatriate staff and emphasized more training of the
Yemeni personnel. The FRG carried out construction of the Sana'a-Taiz road
by contract after competitive bidding, with supervision by a German consult-
ing firm.
3.23      The majority of locally financed road construction, including
construction of municipal streets, is carried out by the HA on the basis of
contracts with rural authorities, cooperatives and municipalities (para 3.17).
Since bidding failed to elicit a satisfactory bid the HA is presently carry-
ing out construction of the Taiz--Turba road, under the FHP, by force account.
In light of the longer and more sophisticated nature of the works, the HA is
employing foreign managerial and technical staff to assist in this operation,
and had purchased most of the required construction equipment (para. 3.10).
The construction time schedule provides for the completion of works in 1977.
3.24      Domestic contractors have mostly had little experience in road
construction other than works of a minor nature. Local firms did, however,
work on Taiz airport and one is currently constructing feeder roads on the
IDA financed Tihama Development project. Some bigger contractors are inter-
ested in highway projects. Two firms bid on the Taiz-Turba road in 1973, but
their bids were rejected on grounds of lack of experience, insufficiency of
equipment and of qualified personnel. The Government is aware of the need
for a bigger involvement of domestic contractors in highway construction and
requested the Association to incllde in the procurement arrangements of the
Taiz-Km 64 road under the proposedi project a 7.5% bidding preference for do-
mestic contractors. During credit negotiations the Government and the Asso-
ciation discussed possibilities to, increase participation of domestic con-
tractors in road works, particularly in construction of feeder roads and
municipal streets, on the lines shlown in Annex C.



-9-
H.   Maintenance
3.25      Highway maintenance has generally been inadequate, mostly due to
lack of sufficient funds, which should be provided by the Government in its
annual budgets. The maintenance efforts are sporadic and are restricted
mostly to urgent works on paved roads and emergency works on gravelled roads
and tracks. There is no planned and programmed maintenance. HA has poten-
tial in personnel and equipment to set up an adequate road maintenance
organization, provided the necessary funds are allocated. The FHP technical
assistance includes formulation of routine and periodic maintenance programs
including related costs. Technical assistance to be provided under the pro-
posed project would help to implement such programs. The Government has in-
dicated that it will increase the road maintenance budget to Rls. 7.0 million
in 1975/76 and subsequently further and regularly increase the funding. On
this basis road maintenance should gradually improve.
I.   Training
3.26      The turnover of HA personnel is high due to low salaries and better
prospects elsewhere in the area. This situation applies particularly to
technicians, skilled mechanics, equipment operators and is, in general,
related to Yemen's present economic conditionTi. As result of staff turnover,
the need for training at all levels in the HA is high. Some on-the-job
training was available on the past highway projects. Since 1971 the UNDP has
been conducting a vocational training program for mechanics and equipment
operators in Taiz. This project is being extended through December 1976.
The technical assistance team under the FHP provides on-the-job training,
which would be extended under the proposed project.
3.27      The HA has received funds from various aid sources for training
abroad and several engineers (including three graduates), technicians and
higher administrative officers, have successfully participated. The FHP
includes for training abroad an amount of US$15,000.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives
4.01      The proposed project is a follow up to the FHP in the fields of
road construction and technical assistance. Of the two roads for which
detailed engineering was carried out under FHP:  Taiz-Km 64 and Damar-Rada'a,
the Taiz-Km 64 road has a higher economic return and is included in the pro-
posed project. The construction of this road would complete the paved highway
from Taiz to the port of Hodeidah and improve the conditions of transport to
the port of Mocha. The continuation for about two years of technical assist-
ance to the HA will provide further strengthening of this institution and
increase its efficiency.



- 10 -
B.   Description
4.02      The project consist of:
(i)  construction with supervision of the Taiz-Km 64 (63 km) road to
primary standards; and
(ii)  technical assistance to the HA during a period of two years.
(a) Taiz-Km 64 Road
4.03      The present road was constructed to gravel standards in 1966 under
the USAID financed project, as a part of the Sana'a-Taiz-Mocha road. Whilst
economically compatible with the traffic envisaged at the time of construction,
the present road has become inadequate. From Taiz to Km 38 the road is located
in the highlands and from Km 38 to Km 64 in the Tihama plain. Vertical and
horizontal alignments are poor, with numerous minor changes in grade and with
horizontal curves of small radius. The average width is 8.5 m including
shoulders. The gravel surfacing is loose, having lost most of its binding
material; near Taiz, where traffic is relatively heavy, the surfacing is worn
down to formation level. Drainage structures require repairs or replacement,
and new structures should be added. The protection works against erosion are
insufficient which results in damage to roadway after heavy rains.
4.04      The propo§ed road would be constructed to primary bitumen surfaced
standards, and would follow the existing road with minor deviations. Details
of the design standards used, which are satisfactory, are in Table 6. The
existing serviceable culverts would be extended and repaired, and new drainage
structures would be built where necessary.
(b) Technical Assistance
4.05      The technical assistance to HA would be a continuation of the ser-
vice under FHP.  The Government is negotiating now a contract for technical
assistance with the consultants Kam'sax/Louis Berger Int. (Denmark/US).
The consultants would provide a five-man team, composed of three highway
engineers, mechanical engineer and administrative/accounts expert. Other
experts on a short-term basis would be available if and when required. The
FHP is coVering the cost of about six months services. The proposed project
includes continuation of technical assistance for about two more years,
totalling about 120 man-months.  The consultants would advise and assist HA
in planning, programming and budgeting road construction and maintenance,
design standards, data collection, craffic regulations, administration and
accounting, organization and quality control of works, administration of
contracts, workshops procedures and staff training, with the objective of
turning HA into an efficient organization.



C.   Status of Engineering
4.06      The detailed engineering of the Taiz-Km 64 road was carried out in
1974 under the FHP by the consultant, Ingeroute/Gibb. The final bidding docu-
ments were completed at the end of February 1975. The draft documents were
reviewed by the Government and the Association and are satisfactory.
D.   Cost Estimates
4.07      The project cost including contingencies is estimated at US$15.7
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$9.8 million. Detailed costs
are shown in the Table on Page 12. The basic road construction costs are
based on the most advantageous bid received May 10, 1975 (Annex D). The
estimated costs of consulting services for supervision of works and technical
assistance are based on man-months and rates for similar services in Yemen.
4.08      The calculation of expected price increases during project execu-
tion which are added to basic costs is shown in Table 7. The quantities con-
tingency of 10% of the estimated costs and of expected price increase is
added to all items in accordance with the normal practice for this type of
work and services. The cost estimates were discussed and agreed with the
Government during credit negotiations.
4.09      The foreign exchange component of the road construction cost is 60%
of the total cost, as shown in the most advantageous bid. The foreign
exchange component in the cost of consulting services is based on the cost of
salaries, transportation, equipment and miscellaneous foreign expenditures
related to such services. It is estimated at 80% of the total cost.
E.   Financing
4.10      The proposed credit of US$9.0 million would cover 92% of the foreign
costs of the project, and would finance the foreign exchange costs of con-
sulting services for supervision of works and technical assistance and about
54% of the cost of road construction. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Deve-
lopment has indicated that it will provide a loan of US$5.0 million for a
period of 40 years including a grace period of 10 years at the interest rate
of 1-1/2%. An agreement was reached to use the proceeds of this loan to
cover 8% of the foreign costs and 72% of the local costs of the project,
financing the local costs of consulting services for supervision of works
and technical assistance and about 34% of the cost of road construction.
The Government will provide US$1.7 million to finance the remaining 12% of
the cost of construction. Details of the proposed financing arrangements
are shown in Table 8. They have been discussed and agreed at negotiations.
The Kuwait Fund advised its agreement by cable. A condition of Credit
effectiveness will be the signing of the loan agreement between the Government
and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.

- 13 -
F.   Implementation
(a) Responsibility
4.11      The HA assisted by consultants will be responsible for execution of
the project. Construction will be carried out by contract following inter-
national competitive bidding according to the Association Guidelines. The
supervision of works will be by consultants. The Government advised that they
will negotiate a contract for supervision with Ingeroute/Gibb, responsible
for the design and will employ the consultants on terms of reference satis-
factory to the Association.
(b) Land Acquisition
4.12      There will be little need for land acquisition in this project,
because the new road will follow to a great extent the existing road. The
Government has an established policy and procedures for land expropriation
for highway projects and no problems are expected in respect of timely avail-
ability of the land required for construction.
(c) Procurement
4.13      A contract for road construction will be awarded after interna-
tional competitive bidding according to Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Bids
were received on May 10, 1975. A preliminary analysis of bids has shown that
the most advantageous bid is the bid of Joint Venture Trapp/Heitkamp/Tarmac
(FRG/UK), a contractor who had recently completed construction of the Sana'a-
Taiz road, is fully mobilized in Yemen for the proposed project, and can start
the works within one month and complete within 10 months thereafter. A sum-
mary analysis of bids is shown in Annex D.
4.14      Since the construction cost is relatively small (base cost estimate
about US$11.5 million) and compact, no advantage was expected from its sub-
division into small linear contracts or by category of work. The "slice and
package" procurement would discourage prospective foreign bidders and probably
increase costs, since the overheads and cost of equipment mobilization for
several lots would be greater than for a single contract. There is no local
experience in highway contracts subdivided by category of work, and use of
this method could affect adversely the procurement.
(d) Construction Method and Schedule
4.15      The methcd of road construction would be generally capital intensive.
Since there is relatively little unemployemnt in Yemen due to the labor
migration to neighboring countries offering better wages, labor intensive
construction methods were not considered. However, drainage structures and
protection works against erosion are designed for extensive use of masonry,
and the most advantageous bid provides for subcontracts of masonry works to
local contractors.



- 14 -
4.16      Subject to the timely finalization of project financing arrange-
ments, construction is expected to start about July/August 1975 and be com-
pleted by about mid-1976. A projTect implementation schedule was discussed
and agreed with the Government during Credit negotiations.
(e) Technical Assistance
4.17      The technical assistance services are expected to be provided by
the consultants (Kampsax/Berger) with whom the Government is presently nego-
tiating a contract under FHP. The project technical assistance funds would
be used after expenditure of the FHP allocation.
G.   Disbursements
4.18      Disbursements from the credit account would be on the basis of 100%
of the foreign exchange costs of consulting services for technical assistance
and supervision of works, and 54% of the cost of road construction. Based on
the foregoing and on the schedule of the project execution (paras. 4.16 and
4.17), an Estimated Schedule of Disbursements has been prepared. The schedule
shown in Annex E, was discussed and agreed with the Government during Credit
negotiations. Surplus funds remaining in the credit account after completion
of the project would be cancelled.
H.   Environmental Impact
4.19      The construction of the project road will minimize dust nuisance
and with its drainage structures and related protection works lessen the
present erosion along the road.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
(a) The Taiz-Km 64 Road
5.01      The Taiz-Km 64 road link is part of Yemen's main rectangular road
grid, connecting Sana'a (the capital) to Hodeidah to Mocha (the main ports)
(via Km 64, where the link from Hodeidah intersects) to Taiz (the main pro-
vincial center) back to Sana'a. Over this link the traffic from and to the
ports of Hodeidah and Mocha move to and from Taiz (the province and the city).
With the completion of the ongoing work on the Sana'a-Taiz highway, under FRG
financing, the proposed project road and the Km 64-Mocha extension would be
the only unpaved sections in the grid. Justification for the improvement of
the latter link (i.e. Km 64-Mocha), now a gravel road with good horizontal and
vertical alignment carrying about 200 vehicles a day, is dependent on deve-
lopment of the Port of Mocha, now being studied as part of an overall port



- 15 -
development study financed by the UNDP. Improvement of the project road would
result in lower transport costs, including savings in fuel, vehicle deprecia-
tion, and time for freight and passenger movement.
5.02      Since there is relatively free entry of individuals into the road
haulage industry in Yemen and competition within the industry, the benefits
of reduced transport costs can be expected to be passed on to users of
transport.
(b) Technical Assistance
5.03      The technical assistance would continue to provide and foster
essential expertise in the HA to enable the organization to better serve
the country's vital transport needs.
B.   Economic Evaluation
(a) The Taiz-Km 64 Road
5.04      As indicated above, the proposed project road is part of the coun-
try's main road grid and the existing road is already carrying significant
traffic volumes. Traffic counts and an O&D survey made by the consultants
in 1973 show ADT's were about 1,050 between Taiz & Turba junction (Km 3.1)
and about 480 between the junction and Km 64.  Details are in Table 9.  Based
on the available earlier traffic figures and vehicle registrations, and proj-
ections of population, GNP, import and export growths, traffic is estimated
to grow at about 7% p.a. over the next 20 years.
5.05      The benefits from the proposed road construction have been calcu-
lated on the basis of savings in vehicle operating cost (VOC) for "normal"
traffic and in road maintenance costs. The construction would not result
in any traffic diversion from other routes since the existing route is already
the "least cost" solution for the area it serves. Development in the road's
immediate influence areas has not been inhibited by lack of the new road;
generated traffic has not therefore been considered. These assumptions may
result in some minor understatement of benefits, but such additional benefits
are not critical to the analysis.
5.06      VOC savings are estimated to range from about 30% to 40% according
to vehicle type. Based on these savings and the above related traffic prog-
noses, the proposed construction would give an Economic Return (ER) of about
14X and a First Year Benefit (FYB) of about 101.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiation the Government assured that it will:
(i)  ensure adequate financing of the HA to cover cost of the
highway administration, road maintenance and improvement



- 16 -
works ordered by the Government; prepare within 8 months of
credit effectiveness, for discussion with the Association,
the HA related work program for a period of not less than
three years, and arrange for consultation with the Associa-
tion on the annual work program of the Highway Authority
prior to the preparation of the annual budget.
(ii)  establish within 12 months of credit effectiveness highway
design standards satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.20);
and
(iii)  employ construction supervision consultants acceptable to the
Association on terms of reference satisfactory to the Asso-
ciation (para. 4.11).
6.02      During credit negotiations, the Government and the Association
discussed possibilities to increase participation of domestic contractors
in roadworks on the lines shown in Annex C (para 3.24).
6.03      Condition of Credit effectiveness will be the signing of the loan
agreement between the Government and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Deve-
lopment (para 4.10).
6.04      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an Association
credit of US$9.0 million to the Government of Yemen on the usual terms.

YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
First Highway Project - Credit 315-YAR
Amount of Credit          US$7.7 million
Date of Credit Agreement June 26, 1972
Effective Date            January 15, 1973
Closing Date              June 30, 1976
1.        The project includes (i) construction and supervision of Taiz-
Turba road; (ii) feasibility studies of about 470 km of roads and detailed
engineering of roads found justified; (iii) technical assistance by con-
sultants to organize and operate the Highway Authority (HA); (iv) purchase
of equipment for feeder road construction and highway maintenance, spare
parts for existing equipment, and engineering and laboratory equipment; and
(iv) training abroad for HA staff. The total cost of the project was esti-
mated at US$8.6 million of which US$7.7 million are financed by the Credit.
The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has agreed to provide a loan
on soft terms of US$800,000 to cover most of the balance of funds required.
2.        The HA was established in November 1972 and a contract for tech-
nical assistance was signed in December 1972 with the joint venture of con-
sultants, T.P. O'Sullivan and F.H. Kocks (UK/German Federal Republic). The
consultants mobilized in January 1973, but due to the gradual deterioration
of working relations with the HA, the contract was terminated on mutual agree-
ment in July 1974. The Government is now negotiating with the consultants,
Kampsax/Berger Int. (Denmark/USA) to provide technical assistance.
3.        Six bids for construction of the Taiz-Turba road were received in
August 1973. However, the four foreign bids were for amounts more than
double of the project cost estimate, and the two domestic bidders were found
lacking required experience and competent staff and short of equipment. All
bids were rejected, and the Association agreed to the Government's proposal
to carry out the works by force account under a contract with the HA and
supervision by SWECO, the Swedish consulting firm responsible for the detailed
engineerlng. Construction started In March 1975 andl completion is expected
in 1977.
4.        Feasibility study included the following roads:  Taiz-Mocha, Damar-
Rada'a - Al Beida and Bajil-Yerim - Mabar. The study was entrusted in 1973
to the consultant, Ingeroute/Gibb (France/UK). Following the consultant's



ANNEX A
Page 2 of 2
recommendation detailed engineering was carried out for two road links found
economically feasible: Taiz-Km 64 and Damar-Rada'a, totalling 116 km. The
detailed engineering, including bidding documents, have been completed.
5.        Orders for all progra-med road equipment, engineering and laboratory
equipment, and spare parts were placed following international competitive
bidding. The completion of delivery is scheduled for 1975.

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
Domestic Contractor's Incentives
1.        The highway and municipal streets construction in Yemen Arab
Republic over the recent years is increasing in volume, and this trend is
expected to continue in the near future. Construction of paved highways is
mainly financed by bilateral aid, while feeder roads and streets are financed
by local resources or by international assistance. Big highway projects have
been carried out in the past by the donor countries, using force account
method or foreign contractors. The new sources of financing now available
are likely to cause a definite shift towards contract work. Feeder roads
and municipal streets were and still are. with few exceptions, carried out
by a government agency, previously by the General Corporation for Construc-
tion and Development and now by the Highway Authority (HA).
2.        The domestic contractors participate in highway works on a very
limited scale. They are in a position to increase this participation and
should be given opportunity and incentives towards such participation. Having
little experience in road works and being short of related equipment and com-
petent personnel, they should start on small contracts and build up gradually
their capacity.
3.        The Govrnment could establish a policv to assist the domestic road
construction industry. In the first place the Government should provide op-
portunity for the contractors to obtain road work contracts. The city coun-
cils and rural authorities should be encouraged to carry out street and feeder
road construction by competitive bidding. Upgrading of short length roads to
bitumen standards under the Government funding should be carried out by
contracts open to domestic contractors.
4.        To help the municipalities and rural authorities in procurement of
works, the HA with the help of technical assistance consultants should prepare
a set of standard conditions and specifications in the English and Arabic
languages. Initially, HA should render assistance in the design and prepara-
tion of bills of quantities and particular specifications, until either
municipal technical staff or rrivate engineering services are available.
5.        To help the contractors, the Government could arrange that the
contracts for work include provision for mobilization advance of about 15%



ANNEX C
Page 2 of 2
of the contract amount, payable on a suitable guarantee, and that the proj-
ects undertaken are fully financed to ensure prompt payments for work carried
out. The Government could also help the domestic contractors by periodical
auction sale of old HA equipment, when maintenance and repairs become onerous
and uneconomical under normal HA procedures.
6.        The measures proposed above are intended to open road construction
in Yemen to domestic contractors and to facilitate their first steps. Con-
tinuing assistance could be rendered when the contractors have gained footing
in this domain. Such assistance could consist of seminars on contracting
procedures and on construction techniques, arrangement for credit facilities,
realistic bonding requirements, application of procurement procedures on
highway projects which would enable domestic contractors to participate, etc.

APPRAISAL OF
A SECOND HIGHIWATAY PROJECT
YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
Summary of Bids Analysis for Construction of Taiz-Km 64 Road,
Received May 10, 1975
1.        Three bids were received as listed below:
(i) Joint Venture Construction Engineers and Builders
Ltd/Almutahar Motors and Engineering (co. (Kenya/YAR); Rls 50,773,355
(ii)  Joint Venture Hayel Saeed Anan and Co./Mohamed Saif
Thabet (YAR); and                                          Rls 51,261,935
(iii)  Joint Venture Trapp/Heitkamp/Tarmac (FRG/UK).              Rls 63,601,024
2.        By cable of Nay 15, 1975, Trapp/Heitkamp/Tarmac offered to reduce
their bid by 4% because the Damar-Rada'a road, for which they have also bid,
was deferred, allowing them to use all equipment from the finished Sana'a
Taiz road on one contract only; by a further 4% if they were allowed to com-
mence the works withini 4 weeks; and by a further 2% if advance payment was in-
creased from 10% to 25% cf the contract sum. They stated in the cable that
this would allow them to reduce their bid to approximately Rls 56,600,000.
3.        All bids include built-in contingency of about 10% comprising day-
work items and a 7% contingencv amount, to be expended as directed by the
Engineer. The bids include Engineer's supervisory staff housing as a provi-
sional item.
4.        The consultants Tngeroute/Gibb, assisting the Government in the
bidding procedure, prepared a preliminary Report on Tenders in which they
recommend to reject bidders (i) and (ii), generally on grounds of their
insufficient capacity and capability, and to negotiate the contract with
Trapp/lleitkamp/Tarmac with a view of reducing his bid amount.
The bid of Construction Engineering and Builders Ltd./Almutahar
Motors & Engineering Co. after deductions of built-in contingencies and
Engineer's housing would be Rls 44,357,234 (US$9.8). The bidder did not
fill in the Qualification Statement, stipulated the start of the works 2-1/2
months after tbh order to commence, and a 24-month completion period, re-
quested 15% advance in lieu of 10%, and claimed 7-1/2% preference for do-
mestic contractors. The Kenyan partner is known as a small contractor
(biggest contract probably not more than US$1.0 million equivalent), and
the YAR partner has experience mainly in building construction. The Joint
Venture is not legally formed, and does not qualify for a 7-1/2% preference.
Ingeroute/Gibb recommendation to reject this bid seems justified.



ANiNEX D
Page 2 of 2
6.        The bid of Hayel Saeed Anan Co./Moohamed Saif Thabet after deduction
of built-in contingencies and Engineer's housing would be Rls 45,249,350
(US$9.95). Hayel Saeed Anan and Co. is a trading company, while MIohamed Thabet
is a building contractor. The Qualification Statement is only partly com-
pleted, but shows that the bidder intends to purchase for this project 66
items of equipment including 30 tippers of 10 tons, 4 heavy bulldozers and
4 graders. He intends to hire 2 highway engineers from the highway construc-
tion firm, Colas, as advisors. He undertakes to start the works within one
month after order to commence and complete within 18 months thereafter.
Considering the time required now for delivery of equipment, a 6 months
delay in completion is likely, and should be assumed. The final cost of
this contract, including price escalation and 10% physical contirgencies
but excluding Engineer's housing, would be US$13.43 equivalent.  Ingeroute/
Gibb recommendation to reject this bid seems justified.
7.        The bid of Trapp/Heitkamp/Tarmac after deduction of built-in con-
tingencies and Engineer's housing would be Rls 55,550,000 (US$12.2). The
bidder offers to negotiate the contract on basis of his cable of May 15, 1975
(para 2). In his bid he offers a further discount if Yerim camp, used for
the Sana'a-Taiz road project, was left to him free of charge for the duration
of the works. His bid is complete, he is a qualified highway contractor, is
fully mobilized in Yemen, and offers to start the works immediately after the
order to commence, and complete within 10 months-thereafter. He undertakes
to employ local contractors for masonry works. His requirement of foreign
exchange is 60% of the contract amount. The final cost of this contract,
based on discounts offered (except 4% offered for early start of works), and
on a short construction period, including price escalation and 10% physical
contingencies but excluding Engineer's housing, would be US$13.86. Ingeroute/
Gibb recommended to negotiate a contract with this bidder. Their recommenda-
tion seems acceptable.
8.        The Government is in favor of negotiating contract with Trapp/
Heitkamp/Tarmac, particularly in view of the Anan/Thabet shortage of equip-
ment, lack of experience in highway construction and of personnel competent
in road construction. The small cost difference between these bidders would
be offset by road users benefits due to the shorter time of construction.
The Government is in favor of developing local road contracting industry,
but the local Joint Venture failed to associate appropriate contracting
firms to ensure a higher availability of equipment and competent personnel.
9.        In view of the above, and of the possibility of a further reduction
of the contract amount during Government's negotiation with the bidder, the
Trapp/Heitkamp/Tarmac bid was used as a basis for the project cost estimate
and the disbursement schedule. The Government undertook to provide Engineer's
housing, estimating its cost at Rls 400,000. This amount is included in the
local cost of construction.
