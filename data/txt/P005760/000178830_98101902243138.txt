INTERNATIONAL UEVELOPYIENT ASSOCIATIOIN
REPORT AND RECOhMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE YEMEN ARAB REPUBLIC
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR), for the equivalent of
US$9.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a second Highway Project.
The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development will participate in financing
the project with a loan of US$5.0 million at an interest rate of 1-1/2 per-
cent per annum, for a.period of 40 years, including 10 years' grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Development in the Yemen Arab Republic"
(R73-161), dated June 18, 1973, was distributed to the Executive Directors on
June 28, 1973. An economic mission visited YAR in September 1974 and its
findings are reflected in the present report. A country data sheet is at-
tached in Annex I.
3.        The Republic was established in 1962, replacing the feudal rule of
the Imamate, under which Yemen had remained almost completely isolated from
the rest of the world. Lack of internal transport and communication facil-
ities lhas contributed to the continuing isolation of many parts of the coun-
try. Since 1962, Yemen has suffered from a long civil war (1962-70) and a
prolonged drought which resulted in the recurrence of widespread famine and
near famine conditions. There were also several frontier clashes with the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.
4.        Political integration has been hindered by tribal differences.   The
end of the civil war left the tribal sheikhs in a stronger and more independ-
ent position than before. This fragmentation of power, combined with the in-
sufficiency of institutions and of trained cadres at the central government
level, has for many years hindered the government's ability to formulate na-
tional economic objectives and carry out a program of economic development.
Although attempts have been made to reduce political differences through the
formation of coalition governments, tribal differences remain a major fac-
tor affecting political stability.
5.        Despite these problems, considerable progress has been made, since
early 1970, in introducing basic elements of modern administration. With
significant technical assistance provided by the IMF, the Bank and the Kuwait
Fund, Yemen established a Central Bank in 1971, and a Central Budget Bureau
and Central Planning Organization in 1972. For 1973/74, the Government pro-
duced its first formal budget.   Moreover, a first ThLree-Year Development Pro-
gram, covering the period of 1973/74-1975/76 was drafted, which defined the
general long-term development strategy for YAR as well as medium-term devel-
opment policies for the public sector. The project list contained in the
Program is confined to public sector projects.



- 2-
Development Objectives and Constraints
6.        The long-term goals for economic development as expressed in the
Tnree-Year Program emphasize (a) the development of agriculture to achieve
self-sufficiency in food; (b) the expansion of the transport and communica-
tions infrastructure to improve economic and social integration; (c) educa-
tion and manpower development to secure the needs of Yemen's future develop-
ment efforts; and (d) institution-building at central and local government
levels. For the Program period, public sector development expenditure of
about YR 936 million (approx. US$208 million) is envisaged; of this 31 percent
has been allocated to transport and communications, 21 percent to education
and manpower development, 15 percent to agriculture, and 10 percent each to
industry and water supply.
7.        Due to widespread shortage of administrative and technical skills
and the scarcity of domestic development finance, the Development Program
rests almost entirely on foreign technical and capital assistance. About
75 percent of the project financing is expected to come from foreign sources.
However, since the planned contributions from the Government budget (19 per-
cent) are themselves mostly financed by external sources, the foreign share
in total financing is much greater.
8.        Yemen is among the ten least developed countries in the world.
Over 80 percent of its estimated 6.3 million people are engaged in agri-
culture producing predominantly for their subsistence. Literacy is excep-
tionally low, estimated at about 10 percent of the population. However,
Yemen's population has some outstanding traditional skills, especially in
land cultivation practices and in house construction. Although there are
only about half a million Yemenis living in urban areas, a pattern of urban
migration is beginning to develop as is migration abroad, notably to Saudi
Arabia. Yemen's cities still lack basic public services. Neither the capi-
tal, Sana'a, nor the port city, Hodeidah, has municipal water supply systems,
and electric power supply is inadequate and unreliable. While progress has
been made in building a basic road network and other transport facilities,
Yemen remains extremely under-developed in virtually every other form of
economic and social infrastructure, and in its institutional and manpower
base.
9.        Another basic constraint to development is the country's narrow re-
source base. In agriculture, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP and
for virtually all of the meagre exports (notably cotton, coffee, and hides
and skins), development is seriously constrained by physical limitations,
particularly the erratic nature of rainfall and the uncertainty of additional
groundwater supplies. Food grains (sorghum, millet, barley and wheat) for
local consumption are the principal crops; only modest quantities of cash
crops (cotton, coffee, qat) are produced. Agriculture is predominantly de-
voted to rainfall-dependent grain production, and as a result of the prolonged
drought conditions, it has been meeting a decreasing share of domestic needs.
Thus, food imports, in part provided through emerging relief operations, grew



-3
dramatically from US$23 million in 1970 to almost US$64 million in 1973,
constituting about half of total recorded imports.
10.       Yemen has little known mineral resources.   Only rock salt has been
exploited so far. Unlike most countries of the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen has
no known oil resources, but exploration is currently under way. Due to the
scarcity of natural resources, but also because of the small domestic market,
industry was virtually non-existent until the late 1970's. Since then a
number of medium-sized, import-substitution plants have been established,
mostly with bilateral assistance. They include a textile mill, a cement fac-
tory, a cigarette factory and other plants producing light consumer manufac-
tures and construction materials. Their overall production, however, still
represents less than 6 percent of GDP.
Recent Developments
11.       Economic developments in recent years have remained overshadowed
by the drought-inflicted poor performance of the agricultural sector. De-
spite the rapid expansion, from extremely low levels, of private and public
services and of industrial activities, GDP at constant prices probably grew
at less than 4 percent a year during 1970-1973, as agriculture remained stag-
nant. The growth of non-agricultural activities was stimulated by sizeable
inflows of capital and skills from abroad provided by both displaced and re-
turning Yemenis (mainly from Ethiopia) and large injections of foreign aid in
support of current and capital expenditure. Moreover, urban growth has been
supported by large private remittances from possibly over half a million
Yemenis working abroad; the workers' remittances were estimated at approxi-
mately US$100 million in 1973.
12.       The large inflow of remittances from Yemenis abroad and the for-
eign cash loans and grants to the government (US$28 million in 1973/74), which
were partly used to finance current budget expenditures, contributed to rais-
ing foreign assets and to increasing inflationary pressure on domestic re-
sources. Consumer prices in YAR are estimated to have increased by over 30
percent in 1973 (over 40 percent in Sana'a), and by probably 25 percent in
1974. Higher prices for imported commodities also contributed to domestic
price increases. With respect to the recent sharp rises in international
oil prices it appears, however, that YAR has, for the time being, been only
moderately affected, as other oil-rich Arab States extended to Yemen special
price and supply arrangements, including the delivery of petroleum products
free of charge.
13.       Yemen's budgetary situation is extremely weak and vulnerable because
of tthe small tax base and the increasing dependence on foreign aid in financ-
ing even current expenditure. Current revenues, based largely on customs
duties, amounted to only 73 percent of current expenditure in 1972/73 and
to 85 percent in 1973/74. The current deficit was reduced to YR 50 million
in 1973/74 (from YR 73 million in the previous year), but mainly as a result
of substantial salary increases following the change in government in mid-
1974, the current budgetary deficit for 1974/75 is estimated to increase to



-4-
YR 81 million, equivalent to one-fifth of budgeted current expenditure. For-
eign budgetary support (mainly from Saudi Arabia) was equivalent to about
one-third of current expenditure in 1973/74 (22 percent in 1972/73), while
development expenditure continued to be financed almost entirely from foreign
aid. Foreign project and commodity aid averaged about YR 80 million (US$18
million) during 1971/72-1973/74.
Reserves and External Debt
14.       The gross foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank increased
substantially in recent years, reaching about US$153 million as of June 30,
1974. Of this amount, only US$83 million represented free reserves, the
balance being mainly blocked accounts with the Central Bank of Egypt. The
free reserves were equivalent to about six months of estimated imports of
goods at the 1973 level. On March 31, 1975, total gross reserves were ap-
proximately US$222 million.
15.       The external public debt outstanding on June 30, 1974 was estimated
at US$339 million, of which US$138 million was undisbursed. The major credi-
tors were: USSR, the People's Republic of China, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Saudi Arabia, the Kuwait Fund and more recently, the Association.
Debt contracted with IDA accounted for US$48.2 million or about 14 percent
of the total reported debt. The USSR, and the People's Republic of China have
provided interest-free loans. Loans from Germany and the Kuwait Fund have
been at interest rates between 1.0 to 2.5 percent per year; other lenders
of relatively small significance in YAR's debt structure, have charged 4-6
percent per annum. The debt service for 1974 was estimated at US$12 million,
equivalent to about 10 percent total exports of goods and services, including
workers' remittances, in 1973/74. The available data indicate a sharply
rising trend in debt servicing obligations, estimated to reach US$20 million
in 1975 and US$23 million in 1976. Yemen has a very limited debt service
capacity. As a least-developed country with an already high debt burden,
but with scope for improved economic performance, Yemen has a strong case
for obtaining assistance in as concessionary a form as possible.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
1t.       The proposed credit would be the seventhl to YAR, bringing total IDA
commitments to about US$57.2 million. Annex II contains a summary statement
of IDA credits and Bank grants and notes on the execution of on-going projects,
as of April 30, 1975.
17.       The major focus of Bank Group activity has been to develop the es-
sential prerequisites for development: the basic institutions, skills and
physical infrastructure, and to begin lending in the dominant productive
sector--agriculture. In 1971, the Bank made a grant of US$200,000 to help
finance, jointly with the Kuwait Fund for Economic Development, a team of



planning and economic advisors; in September 1973 a second Bank grant of
US$200,000 to make possible the continuation and expansion of the planning
team services, was approved. The Government has recently asked the Bank and
the Kuwait Fund for Economic Development to extend this technical assistance
and to expand it into the field of public administration. This request is
being considered and a mission visited Yemen in early March to review the
public administration system in the country. The Bank is also providing
technical assistance for institution building to the Ministry of Agriculture
through the presence of four advisors, financed by UNDP with the Bank serving
as Executing Agency.
18.       In June 1972, IDA extended a Credit of US$7.7 million equivalent for
a first Highway Project. The project has helped create a national Highway
Autlhority, provided equipment for road maintenance and feeder road construc-
tion, and financed feasibility studies and detailed designs of important high-
way links. An important secondary road from Taiz to Turba will also be con-
structed under the project.   In May 1973, the Association made a US$10.9
million Credit for the Tihama Agricultural Development Project which will help
finance the development of surface and groundwater irrigation works at Wadi
Zabid in the Tihama (coastal) region, the establishment of a Tihama Develop-
ment Authority and institutions for agricultural credit, extension and re-
search, training and a major soils and groundwater survey of the Wadi Mawr
region. The project is proceeding satisfactorily. The Kuwait Fund is fi-
nancing $6.0 million of project costs. A US$11.0 million Credit for an Edu-
cation Project was approved in July 1973. The project is an integrated pro-
gram of assistance with the UNDP (UNESCO, FAO, ILO), Federal Republic of
Germany and United Arab Emirates, and will help meet the most immediate needs
of the educational system. It will concentrate on improving and expanding
teacher training and secondary school education and establish the country's
first vocational and agricultural training institutions and non-formal basic
education centers. A US$2.3 million Credit for an Industrial Estate Project
was approved on January 29, 1974. This project is designed to help stimulate
investment in modern small-scale industry and provide a model and pattern for
future industrial development. On the same date a US$6.25 million Credit for
the Sana'a Water Supply Project was approved. This project will provide
Sana's with its first adequate public water supply system. It will also
help in creating a competent national organization to administer the country's
water and sewerage systems. A credit of US$10.0 million for the Southern
Uplands Rural Development Project was approved on May 6, 1975.
19.       Future Bank Group activity will concentrate on reinforcing the in-
stitutional progress made in the essential sectors of transportation, agri-
culture and public utilities; and continue to help devise an appropriate
development strategy and investment program including special project iden-
tification and preparation work. Negotiations on a US$8.1 million Credit for
a Hodeida Water Supply and Sewerage Project have been completed and the credit
documents are expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors for con-
sideration in June 1975. Port development, education and agricultural credit



-6-
projects are still in the planning stage. The Bank Group's lending strategy
recognizes that Yemen is among the poorest of the 25 least-developed countries
and thus requires special assistance, which justifies IDA financing of a high
percentage of project costs, including local expenditures.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
The Transport Sector
The Transport System
20.       Until the late 1950's, modern transport infrastructure was almost
completely lacking in Yemen. Only primitive tracks, suitable for four-wheel
drive vehicles and animal transport, connected major towns and there were no
rail facilities or internal air service. Port facilities were limited to the
ancient port of Mocha, suitable only for lighterage. In 1957 the elements
of a modern transport system began to be created, initially with bilateral
assistance and later with the help of IDA. A new port at Hodeida, financed
by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was completed in 1960; an
international airport was built in Sana'a with the aid of the Federal Republic
of Germany (FRG).
The Highway Network
21.       While the highway network, totalling about 3,670 km, is not offi-
cially classified into types of roads, 1,370 km are considered to be main
roads, and about 2,300 km secondary and feeder roads. About 930 km of roads
are paved, and a further 200 km are under construction to paved standards.
Gravel and earth roads total 1,460 km and unimproved tracks about 1,080 km.
The latter are generally old trails adapted to motor traffic by minor improve-
ment of the more difficult sections.
22.       Highway development began in 1967.    Bitumen-surfaced roads from
Hodeida to Sana'a and to the other main city, Taiz, and a gravel road from
Sana'a through Taiz to Mocha, were constructed between 1957 and 1975, with
assistance from the People's Republic of China (PRC), the USSR, and the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The FRG is now
financing the paving of the Sana'a-Taiz road, while IDA is assisting highway
development under Credit 315-YAR (see para 23). Construction and improvement
of feeder roads is proceeding concurrently, under schemes initiated and fi-
nanced by local authorities and cooperatives, with the assistance of the World
Food Program (WFP) and within various agricultural projects.
Previous IDA Lending in the Transport Sector
23.       The Association is financing under Credit 315-YAR of June 26, 1972,
a project which includes the construction of the Taiz-Turba road; feasibility



-7-
studies and detailed engineering of other priority roads; the purchase of
equipment for the Highway Authority (HA); and technical assistance and staff
training for HA. The estimated cost o. this project, which was the first
Bank Group operation in Yemen after it became a member in May 1970, was $8.6
million, of which the IDA Credit financed US$7.7 million. After serious irii-
tial delays because the bids for road construction received from qualified
contractors were considered to be unreasonably high, it was agreed that HA
would carry out the construction of this road by force account. Implementation
began in March 1975 (see Annex II).
Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
24.       Yemen is still in an early stage of development.   Although remark-
able progress has been made in the last decade, Yemen has not yet been able
to prepare a comprehensive economic development plan, and has only limited
capacity to identify and to prepare investment projects and to evaluate their
economic and financial viability. No overall transport planning exists,
either in the Central Planning Organization (CPO), the unit within the
Ministry of Development which is responsible for national economic planning,
or in the ministries concerned. Transport investments have been made on a
project by project basis, with the principal determining factor in their
selection being the availability of foreign aid for particular projects.
Highway Planning and Administration
25.       Two ministries are responsible for the highway network:   the
Ministry of Development (MD) and the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). The
formulation of policies and the financing of highway development is the res-
ponsibility of MD, within which highway planning is carried out by CPO; MPW
is responsible for project implementation and highway administration. The
executing agency for all highway matters is the Highway Authority (HA), an
autonomous agency established by Presidential Council Decree in November 1972,
whose responsibilities include detailed planning, design, construction, main-
tenance, contract supervision, and execution of works for local authorities
and other entities (on a contractual basis). HA was initially under the
auspices of the MD, but was transferred to MPW in April 1975. It is control--
led by a Board of Directors, which approves its budget, formulates its poli-
cies and supervises their implementation. It has about 800 permanent staff
members, with headquarters in Sana'a and operating sub-divisions in Sana'a,
Taiz and Hodeida. HA has its own capital, its main assets being road equip-
ment and buildings taken over from the General Corporation for Construction
and Development (GCCD), which previously carried out highway works as well as
constructing public buildings. HA has insufficient highway and mechanical
engineers, but technical assistance provided under the first credit, and pro-
posed under the second, is contributing to strengthening it in this area.
For adequate staffing it will require greater financial support from Govern-
ment (see para. 29 below).



-8-
26.       The turnover of HA personnel is high, due to relatively low salaries
compared with those available elsewhere in the area. This situation applies
particularly to technicians, skilled mechanics and equipment operators. The
problem is a general one, related to Yemen's present economic and manpower
conditions. Some on-the-job training has been provided under highway projects,
including the first credit, and since 1971 UNDP has been conducting a voca-
tional training program for mechanics and equipment operators in Taiz. The
proposed credit would also provide on-the-job training.
Highway Program
27.       In 1971, the Swedish Consulting Group (SWECO) carried out an Invest-
ment Feasibility Study financed by UNDP, with the Bank acting as Executing
Agency. SWECO proposed a program of highway investment for 1972-79 totalling
about 1,400 km. Although this investment program was prepared using limited
traffic data and a summary economic analysis, it provided a sufficient basis
to determine priorities. The Government has a fairly large program of paved
roads construction, consisting of about 960 km of main and secondary roads,
which includes about 70 percent of the roads proposed in the study. Specific
feasibility studies and detailed engineering for some of these roads were
carried out under the first IDA credit, including the road to be financed
under the second credit. Other studies have been carried out under UNDP proj-
ects and various bilateral aid programs.
Financing of Program
28.       Major highway construction has been financed mainly by bilateral
assistance and, to a smaller extent, by the Association. Most of the feasi-
bility studies and detailed engineering, training, technical assistance and
equipment have been financed by UNDP and the Association. The Government's
development budgets are intended to cover part of the local costs of IDA and
LNDP projects, and some project preparation studies.    The construction of
feeder roads is financed mainly by local authorities and cooperatives, with
the help of the World Food Program (WFP). In 1970/71, a WFP project con-
tributed food commodities estimated at US$0.6 million for the construction of
about 300 km of feeder roads: An expansion of this project for five years has
been requested by the Government and is being considered by WFP. Financing
for the construction of some feeder roads is also included in both IDA credits
for the Tlhama Development project and the Southern Uplands Rural Development
project.
Financing of Highway Authority
29.       Due to financial constraints, budgetary allocations for HA have so
far been below the amounts required for the effective operation in highway
administration and road maintenance, particularly as the financial uncer-
tainties make it difficult to set up a sound basic staff structure and work
program. To maintain a viable basic organization, HA has been undertaking
works for local authorities (such as street construction) by contract. It
was agreed that, the Government will: (i) ensure adequate financing for HA
to cover the cost of its operations, that is, highway administration, road



- 9 -
maintenance and road improvement works ordered by the Government (Section
4.04, draft Development Credit Agreement); (ii) prepare within eight months
of credit effectiveness, for discussion with the Association, a work program
for HA for a period of not less than three years; and (iii) arrange for con-
sultations with the Association each year on the annual work program of HA,
prior to the preparation of its annual budget, and take appropriate measures
to implement each such program (Section 4.03, draft Development Credit Agree-
ment).
Statistics
30.       No regular traffic counts have been taken in Yemen, although some
counts have been made for individual road projects. With the aid of technical
assistance under the first credit, to be continued under the second, a traffic
counting program has started on all major roads and on roads in the Govern-
ment's proposed feeder road construction program.
Legislation
31.       At present, few regulations govern highway traffic.   Registration
of vehicles and licensing of drivers are required, but are poorly organized.
T'here is no legislation controlling vehicle weights or dimensions, nor have
design standards for roads yet been formally adopted: standards have been
established on a project-by-project basis. Recommended legislation to meet
these needs was prepared by the technical assistance team under the first
credit. Assistance with the implementation of these measures would be con-
tinued under the proposed credit. It was agreed that the Government will,
within 12 months of credit effectiveness, establish general highway design
standards which are satisfactory to the Association (Section 4.02, draft
Development Credit Agreement).
Engineering and Contracting
32.       There are currently two consulting firms employed on detailed high-
way engineering: SWECO on the Sana'a-Marib road (financed by the Abu Dhabi
Fund for Arab and Economic Development), and Ingeroute-Gibb on the Rada'a-Al
Beida Road (financed by the Government). Most domestic contractors have had
little experience in road construction, other than works of a minor nature.
Local firms did, however, work on Taiz airport and one is currently construc-
ting feeder roads under the IDA financed Tihama Development project. Some
bigger contractors are interested in highway projects. Two local firms bid on
the Taiz-Turba road in 1973, but their bids were rejected on grounds of lack
of experience, and insufficiency of equipment and qualified personnel. The
Government is aware of the need for greater involvement of domestic contractors
in highway construction and has requested the Association to include the 7.5
percent bidding preference for domestic contractors applicable to Yemen in
procurement arrangements for road construction under the proposed credit.
During negotiations, different ways and means were discussed as to how to
increase the participation of domesic contractors in roadworks, particularly
in the construction of feeder roads and municipal streets.



- 10 -
Maintenance and Training
33.       Mostly due to lack of sufficient funds (see para. 29 above), highway
maintenance is inadequate, sporadic and unplanned: maintenance is restricted
mostly to urgent repair works. HA has the potential in personnel and equip-
ment to set up an adequate road maintenance organization, provided the neces-
sary funds are allocated. The technical assistance team under the first
credit is formulating routine and periodic maintenance programs, including
related costs. Technical assistance would be provided under the proposed
credit to help implement such programs. The Government has increased the
road maintenance budget from Rls 1.0 million in 1974/75 to Rls 7.0 million
each in the years 1975/76 and 1976/77. This large increase in allocation
would improve road maintenance substantially.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
34.       The project would be a follow-up to the First Highway Project with
respect to both road construction and technical assistance. Of the two roads
for which detailed engineering was carried out under the first credit, Taiz-
km 64 and Damar-Rada'a, the Taiz-km 64 has higher priority and provision for
its construction is included in the project. The project was appraised in
November/December 1974. Negotiations were held in Washington from May 15 to
16, 1975. The Yemen delegation was headed by Mr. Al-Kurshumi, Minister of
Public Works, and included Messrs. Hamadani, Kassim, Galandar and Al-Kibssi.
Project Description
35.       The project is summarized in Annex III and described in detail in
the Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway Project, Yemen
Arab Republic " (No. 771-YAR), dated June 3, 197'S, which is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.   lt consists of:
(i)  construction (with supervision) of the Taiz-km 64 road (63 kin)
to primary bitumen-surfaced standards; and
(ii)  continuation of technical assistance to HA to increase effi-
ciency and effectiveness in highway planning, construction,
maintenance and administration, for a period of two years.
The project road is the only unpaved section (apart from the Km-64-Mocha
extension) of Yemen's main rectangular road grid (see map), which connects
the capital (Sana'a), the main ports (Hodeida and Mocha) and the other main
towns (Taiz). Km-64 is the junction where the road from Taiz meets the road
joining Haoeida and Mocha. Thus the Taiz-km 64 road connects Taiz to Hodeida
and to Mocha, as well as being the shortest route from Sana'a to Mocha.    It
crosses mountainous country, is currently of poor alignment, and its gravel
surface is in poor condition.



Project Cost and Financing
36.       The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at
US$15.7 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$9.8 million, or 62
percent. The proposed credit of US$9.0 million would cover about 92 percent
of the foreign exchange costs of the project. The Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development will participate in financing the project with US$5.0
million at an interest rate of 1-1/2 percent per annum, for a period of 40
years, including 10 years' grace. The Government would provide the balance
of US$1.7 million. Details of costs and financing are shown in Annex III.
Project Execution
Responsibility
37.       HA, assisted by consultants, will be responsible for executing the
project. The Government will negotiate a contract for supervision of construc-
tion with the consultants Ingeroute/Gibb, who were responsible for the road
design under the first credit. The consultants will be employed on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.02, draft Development
Credit Agreement).
38.       There will be little need for land acquisition in this project,
because the new road will follow, to a great extent, the existing road align-
ment. The Government has an established policy and procedure for land expro-
priation for highway projects and no problems are expected in respect of
timely availability of the land required for construction.
Technical Assistance
39.       The technical assistance to HA would be a continuation of that pro-
vided under the first credit. Negotiations with Kampsax/Louis Berger Int.
(Denmark/US) are underway to provide these services. The consultants would
provide a five-man team, composed of three highway engineers, a mechanical
engineer, and an administrative and accounts expert. Other experts would be
available on a short-term basis, if and when required. Funds are still avail-
able under the first credit for about six months' services of the technical
assistance team. The project includes continuation of technical assistance
for about two more years, totalling about 120 man-months. The consultants
would advise and assist HA in planning, programming and budgeting road con-
struction and maintenance, design standards, data collection, traffic regula-
tions, administration and accounting, organization and quality control of
works, administration of contracts, workshops procedures and staff training.
This technical assistance would continue to provide and to foster essential
expertise in HA, to enable it better to serve the country's vital transport
needs.



- 12 -
Construction Method and Schedule
40.       The method of road construction would be generally capital intensive.
Sinee there is relatively little unemployment in Yemen due to the labor migra-
tion to neighboring countries, labor intensive construction methods were not
considered. However, drainage structures and protection works against
erosion are designed for extensive use of masonry. Subcontracts of masonry
works are expected to be made with local contractors.
Procurement and Disbursements
41.       Contracts for road construction would be awarded after international
competitive bidding according to World bank Guidelines for Procurement. Bids
were received on May 10, 1975. Although the contract has not yet been awarded,
a preliminary analysis of bids has shown that the most advantageous bid is
the one received from Trapp/Heit Kamp/Tarmac (joint venture, Federal Republic
of Germany/United Kingdom). This firm had recently completed construction
of the Sana'a-Taiz road and can start the works within one mmonth and complete.2
within 10 months thereafter.
42.       Disbursements from the credit account would be on the basis of 100
percent of the foreign exchange costs of consulting services for technical
assistance and supervision of works, and 54 percent of the cost of road con-
struction.  An estimated Schedule of Disbursements is given in Annex III.
Economic Justification
43.       The relationship of the Taiz-km 64 road link to the remainder of
Yemen's road network is described in para. 35 above. Construction to adequate-.
standards of the project road would result in lower transport costs, princi-
pTally between Taiz and Hodeida, Taiz and Mocha, and Sana'a and Mocha, includ-
ing savings in fuel, vehicle depreciation, and a saving in time for freight
afid passenger movement. The road would not divert traffic from other routes,
since the existing route is already the "least cost" solution for the area it
serves. The savings in vehicle operating cost are estimated to range from
about 30 percent to 40 percent according to vehicle type. The economic return
on Lhe investment in this proposed road construction is estimated at about
14 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Yemen Arab
Republic and the Association, the Reconmiendation of the CoMM4ttee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreements and the text
of the resolutions approving the proposed development credit are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 13 -
45.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 29 and 31 of this report.
46.       Section 6.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement provides for
an additional condition of effectiveness, namely the signing of Kuwait Fund
Loan Agreement by the Borrower and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Develop-
ment.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

Directors in July 1971, to help finance, jointly with the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development, a team of planning and economic advisors. The team of
five advisors has helped establish the Central Planning Organization (CPO)
which is responsible for preparing a development program, devising general
economic policies, identifying and preparing investments projects, and co-
ordinating external aid. The CPO is perhaps the most dynamic and active
public sector organization in Yemen. The Executive Directors approved on
September 11, 1973 a Bank grant of US$200,000 equivalent to make possible the
continuation of the planning team. The Government has recently requested the
Kuwait Fund for Economic Development and the Bank to expand their joint on-
going technical assistance into the field of public administration.    This
request is being considered and a mission visited Yemen in early March to
review the public administration system in the country.
Note: A credit of US$10.0 million (Cr. 545) for the Southern Uplands Project
was signed on May 13, 1975.

Cr. No. 315-YAR - Highway; US$7.7 million Credit of J;ine 26, 1972; Closing i)ate:
June 30, 1976.
The Yemen Government established a Highway Authority in November
1972, appointed as its Director a competent and experienced civil engineer
and appointed three engineering firms for consulting services: technical
assistance, feasibility studies and supervision of construction. The feasi-
bility studies have been completed, as well as the detailed engineering,
including bidding documents of the two selected roads. After satisfactorily
completing phase I technical assistance services (data collection, recommenuda-
tion on reorganization and work program) the workLng relations between the
Highway Authority and the consultants gradually deteriorated and the contract
was terminated in July 1974, on mutual agreement. Negotiations for engagement
of new consultants are in progress. Construction of the Taiz-Turba road has
been delayed, because of the six bids received, four foreign bids were for
amounts more than double the appraisal estimate, and in excess of the construc-
tion costs current at the time of bidding, while two domestic bidders, offer-
ing acceptable prices, were found lacking required experience, staff and equip-
ment. All bids were rejected and the Government and Association agreed that
the road be constructed by the Highway Authority under supervision of the
consultants. The Highway Authority acquired necessary equipment under the
Government advance payment, and is employing foreign managerial and technical
staff to assist in this construction. The work started in March 1975, and
is scheduled to be completed in two years. The road maintenance and construc-
tion equipment, engineering equipment and spare parts have been ordered, and
delivery is expected to be completed in 1975.
Cr. No. 376-YAR - Tihama Agriculture; US$10.9 million Credit of May 2, 1973;
Closing Date: .June 30, 1978.
The Development Credit was declared effective on September 4, 1973.
The Tihama Development Authority, responsible for project execution, was set
up and two advisors (technical and financial) were appointed by end of 1973.
Project consultants, appointed since April 1973, have completed designs of
four preliminary works contracts, of which three have already been awarded to
local contractors. Engineering designs and contract documents for the first
of the two main civil works contracts were recently completed, reviewed and
issued in May 1975 to international contractors; documents for the second
are due for issue by December 1975. The Agricultural Credit Fund was legally
established towards end of 1974. The Credit Manager and the Field Manager
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project executions.

for the ACF have been appointed and work is progressing satisfactorily. A
cost overrun of about US$17 million or 100 percent over the estimated cost
at the time of appraisal, is envisaged. A Re-Appraisal Mission will be in
the field in July 1975.
CR. No. 421-YAR - Education Project; US$11 million Credit of July 19, 1973
Closing Date:   December 31, 1978.
The Development Credit was declared effective on April 10, 1974.
The Government has appointed the five expatriate members of the Project UniL,
which is performing satisfactorily.   Several members of the UNDP financed
Task Force are also in the field. Procurement of equipment and books for the
nine existing schools is underway. The Consultant Architects for the project
have been appointed and sites for the project institutions have also been
selected. In April 1975 a Bank mission visited Sana'a to review the special
studies prepared by the Task Force on non-formal and secondary education.
CR. No. 464-YAR - Water Supply Project: US$6.25 million Credit of March 4,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Development Credit was declared effective on July 15, 1974.
Tenders for the principal contracts were opened mid-January and are being
evaluated by the consultant and the National Water and Sewerage Authority
(NWSA). Award of contracts is expected to be made in May 1975. Good prog-
ress has been made in recruiting staff for the newly-established NWSA and
for operating the existing Sana'a water facilities. Project implementation
has been delayed by several months, following delays in preparation of final
design and tender documents. The Government has decided to meet the cost
overruns of about $3.5 million for this project from its own resources.
Cr. No. 465-YAR - Industrial Estate Project; US$2.3 million Credit of
March 4S, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The Development Credit was declared effective on November 27, 197A.'
The Advisor to the Director General has been appointed and is now in the field.
The InCIusLrial Engineer has been also appointed and wll arrive in Yemen in
June 1975. The project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. The
Director General has returned to Yemen after completion of a very useful
traini.t r:. program.  The consulting engineers are in the process of preparing
a detafle6i masterplan, the project designs and the tender documents.   Ilihey
will also supervise the construction. The project is proceeding on schedule.
Cr. No. 545-YAR - Southern Uplands Rural Development Plrojecz; US$10.0 millian
Credit of May 13, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
The Development Credit was approved on May 6, 1975 and signed on
