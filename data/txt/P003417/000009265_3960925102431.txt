PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
THREE PORTS PROJECT, LOAN 2207-CHA
PROJECT COMPLETION tEPORT
EVALUATIONf SUOMIRY
Introduction
1.       The project was only the third Bank lending operation for China, and
the first in the transport sector. Prom project identification in 1980 until
project virtual completion in 1986 (and final closure in 1988), the project
period coincided with major reforms in the national economy, long overdue
developments in the transport sector and decentralization of the ports
subsector.
2.       Government's objectives in the transport sector are to increase the
intensity of railway, road and waterway utilization to cope with the rapidly
growing economy as well as the increasing demand for the transport of raw
materials, manufactured goods and passengers. Coal transportation by sea from
the loading ports in northern China to the ports in the south, and thereafter
by land to the different power stations, is particularly essential for energy
supply and hence for industrial growth. China also needs to substantially
expand its port facilities to overcome the problems created by the steady
increase in traffic and the inadequate berth capacity and container handling
capability.
Project Obiectives and Description
3.       The main objective of the project was to enable the three most impor-
tant ports in China (Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianjin) to meet short-term
requirements in order not to become serious bottlenecks in the country's
economic development.  In order to achieve the above objective, the project
included construction of container terminals at the above ports; construction
of a coal terminal at Huangpu port; provision of container handling and coal
handling equipment to serve the above mentioned terminals; training of ports,
managers, staff and labor; and carrying out a containerization study of the
hinterlands of the three ports to identify intermodal terminals, other facili-
ties and transport equipment required. Total ;roject cost was estimated at
US$427.4 million equivalent. The Bank loan of US$124 million was expected to
be disbursed over 3X years.
Implementation Experience
4.       Loan negotiations were difficult, partly attendant to the fact that
China was a new borrower, not used to the Bank's normal project preparation
requirements, particularly its interest (and information requirements), as a
development institution, in broader planning and institutional issues beyond
the specific project focus. Negotiations involved three sessions starting
February 1982 and ending September 1982. The Loan became effective in
February 1983. Civil works, studies and training were financed by the



_ vi -
Government whereas the Bank loan financed coal and container handling equip-
ment. The coal and container terminals were designed by local institutes and
constructed by local construction bureaus under the Ministry of Communications
(MOC). Construction was completed on schedule and the quality of work was
good. Training was carried out in China. Japan and Belgium; it exceedei the
SAR requirements. The containerization study was adequately carried out by a
local institute; among other things, it proposed certain measures to
strengthen the hinterland transportation of containers.
5.       Bid prices for equipment financed by the Loan under ICB were much
lower than the prevailing world prices (in an apparent attempt by some
suppliers to gain an early foothold in what appeared as a potentially large
new market), and about 60Z lower than the appraisal estimate. As a result,
the Bank agreed to a Government request to: (a) purchase additional
container-handling equipment totalling some US$18 million; and (b) cancel
US$56.03 million from the signed loan of US$124 million. The majority of
equipment was procured from foreign countries and has performed satisfac-
torily; however, the few items manufactured locally proved to be inferior in
quality and efficiency to those manufactured outside China.
6.       The project was successfully completed in its entirety on schedule at
a total cost of US$266.15 million as compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$427.40 million. However, the purchase of merely one additional crane for
Huangpu port, resulted in delaying project completion, and consequently this
PCR, by about two years. No disbursements were made between January 1988 and
February 1989.
Proiect Results
7.       Project objectives have been fully achieved.  The amount of coal
being handled on the new coal terminal at Huangpu exceeded the design capacity
of the terminal as well as the appraisal estimate. Container traffic throligh
the project container terminals is steadily increasing, however, it did not
reach its full capacity. Except for Sh&nghai's 1988 traffic, container traf-
fic was still below appraisal estimates by about IOZ in Huangpu and 502 in
Tianjin as a result of the recent decline in importation through the latter
port. In spite of this decline, several factors, including lower project
costs and higher productivity, contributed to the overall ERR (342) being
higher than the appraisal prediction (29?) with Shanghai and Tianjin achieving
a higher ERR and Huangpu a lower one. Training achieved its objectives of
increasing operations efficiency, and the new computer equipment resulted in
better management information system. The containerization study was useful
in assisting the Government to formulate its future policies in regard to
containers, stress the various issues in the subsequent Bank port projects and
focus the attention on che relative importance of the various transportation
modes.

Sustainability
8.       The project is likely to be sustainable consideringt
-     the  financial  position  of  the  three  ports  has substantially
improved and is sound at present;
-     port productivity has increased moro th-n expected at appraisal;
-     the project - except for one  crane (see para 6) - was implemented
within the original timeframe; and
-     the World Bank  continues  to  play  an  active  role  in the port
subsector witness the five follow-on port projects.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The project was successful as regards its objectives, components,
design and implementation in spite of the facts that: (a) container traffic
was below appraisal estimates; (b) some of the equipment manufactured locally
was below international standards; (c) some of the spare parts provided under
the project were consumed without being replaced resulting in some of the
equipment not operating as efficiently as originally hoped; and (d) final
disbursement was made 15 months later as a result of procuring one additional
crane. Some specific factors of success can be identified as follows:
(a) Bank staff responsible for the project made a useful contribution by
providing technical assistance to the executing agencies during
project preparation and implementation;
(b)  since this was  he first Bank lending operation in the ports subsec-
tor in China, Bank judgement on the ability of local institutes and
construction bureaus to design and construct civil works was correct
based on the quality and timing of work carried out. Bank insistence
on independent consultants reviewing tender documents for equipment
resulted in procuring high quality equipment, however: (i) the bank
should have looked more thoroughly into the ability of local manufac-
turers to produce good container handling equipment; and (ii) the
Bank should not have agreed to Government request to acquire the
additional crane referred to in para. 6 above because that request
came very late and thus resulted in significant delay in full loan
disbursement. It would have been preferable to have provided finance
for this additional crane in a sequential loan. In particular, the
use of ICB for equipment purchase resulted in huge savings in equip-
ment costs; and
(c) the demonstration objective of the project has been fully achieved,
resulting in better efficiency and higher productivity. In addition,
the follow-on Bank-supported port projects are expected to replicate
in other ports the technology and development approach experienced in
this project.



PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
THREE PORTS PROJECT. LOAN 2207-CHA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      Inadequate transportation system and shortage of energy are identi-
fied as the most critical bottlenecks in the Chinese economy. The recent
rapid growth of China's economy has stimulated an increasing demand for the
shipment of all sorts of commodities as well as for passenger traffic. The
transport system has been seriously overloaded in the last decade; capacity
constraints are evident in all modes. Efforts to increase the intensity of
railways, road and waterway utilization are urgently needed, and are being
pursued. In addition to providing new facilities where necessary, Government
strategy will have to rely mainly on incroasing the productivity of existing
facilities. China also needs, in particular, to substantially expand its port
facilities to relieve the growing constraint to external trade caused mainly
by inadequate container handling capability. The objective of the project was
thus to meet short-term requirements in China's three most important ports
(Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianjin) while Government evolves a long-term strategy
for meeting the country's requirements for port facilities through the
remainder of the century.
1.2      China's port traffic has been 3rowing rapidly since the economy was
opened to foreign trades between 1975 and 1987 traffic at the 15 major deep-
water ports increased from 144 million tons in 1975 to 217 million tons in
1980 and to 366 million tons in 1987. About one third of total traffic is
coal which moves mainly from northern coal loading ports for distribution
through ports on the south and east coasts. Container traffic through these
ports is also rapidly increasing, reaching 316,000 TEU 1/ (twenty-foot equiva-
lent units) in 1987 as compared to 64,000 TEU in 1980. During the period
1981-85 port traffic growth outstripped the growth of port capacity resulting
in severe congestion. At the time of project appraisal, ship waiting time for
berth was 2.5 days in Huangpu, 2.3 in Shanghai and 3.4 in Tianjin; such delays
are unacceptable. By 1986 congestion was alleviated as major new facilities
came into service and a return to more restrictive import policies slowed the
rate of traffic growth.
1.3      This project was the third Bank loan to China; it was the first in
the transport sector. It was approved in November 1982, and consisted mainly
of constructing additional container terminals in Huangpu, Shanghai, and
Tianjin, a coal terminal at Huangpu, and handling equipment for these
terminals. (Maps IBRD 15813, 15815, 15817 and 15845). The Bank continued
thereafter to support the Covernment's objectives of expanding port capacities
and improving productivities therein. The second project, (Tianjin Port
1/ Containers are normally 20 ft or 40 ft long. A 40 ft container is
considered equal to two 20 ft containers (2 TEU). The term TEU is used
worldwide in shipping and ports.



- 2 -
Project, Ln. 2689-CHA) is financing the construction of 11 additional berths
at Tianjin for timber, construction materials and general cargo. The third
project, (Huangpu Port Project, Ln. 2877-CHA/Cr. 1845-CHA), is financing the
construction of five additional berths in the Xinsha area of Huangpu port for
coal, iron ore, bulk fertilizer and general cargo. The fourth project,
(Dalian Port Project Ln. 2907-CHA/Cr. 1875-CHA), is financing construction of
a new terminal at Dayao Bay for container and break-bulk cargo. The fifth
project, (Ningbo and Shanghai Ports Project Ln. 3006-CHA), is financing
construction of a container berth and two general cargo berths at Ningbo as
well as construction of two multi-purpose terminals comprising eight berths
each, two coal handling berths and an 80,000 ton capacity grain silo at
Shanghai. The sixth, (Xianien Port Project Ln. 3007-CHA) is financing
construction of one container berth, two multi-purpose berths and one coal
berth at Xiamen. All the above lending operations also finance associated
cargo handling equipment, training, technical assistance and studies.
1.4      The Bank is supporting the Government's objectives for development of
the transport sector, and its initiatives with both financial and technical
assistance. Four railway projects (Loans 2394-CHA, 2540-CHA, 2678/Cr.
1680-CHA and 2968-CHA) have assisted the expansion of capacity on key routes,
and the manufacture of electric locomotives, passenger coaches and signalling
equipment, and provided for strategic studies for technological modernization,
as well as expansion of line capacities and manufacturing facilities. Five
highway projects (Loan 2539/Cr. 1594-CHA, Loan 2811/Cr. 1792-CHA, Loan 2591/Cr
1917-CHA, Loan 2952, and Cr. 1984-CHA) involve the construction or improvement
of both national and rural roads. Besides these subsector-specific opera-
tions, the Bank recently has begun to assist the Government in implementing
projects of a wider nature. For example, a review of the utilization of water
transport was completed in 1987, a comprehensive transportation study for
Guangdong Province is in progress, and a provincial transport sector project
is being prepared for Jiangsu Province which includes highway and inland
vaterway improvements. A study of coal transportation is planned for FY89-90
to complement the recently completed study of coal pricing and an ongoing
study of coal utilization.
1.5      Appraisal of the project took place in July 1981.  Negotiations
started in March 1982 and were completed in September 1982 and required con-
siderable efforts from Bank staff during and in between three sessions
(paras. 2.8 to 2.10 and para. 7.2) mainly due to China's unfamiliarity with
the Bank. Since the start of project implementation, cooperation between the
Government and the Bank became excellent resulting in all project objectives
(paras. 2.11 and 4.8) being adequately met. They included among other things
the preparation by the Government of a containerization study of the hinter-
lands of the three ports to identify inland intermodal terminals, other
facilities and transport equipment required to optimize the door to door
transport potential of the containerization of cargo through these ports.
1.6      Total project cost was estimated during appraisal at Y 748 million or
US$427.4 million equivalent of which US$125.5 million equivalent in foreign
currency. The Bank loan of US$124 million equivalent, was to finance the
direct foreign exchange costs of imported equipment (or the ex-factory costs
of locally manufactured equipment). Civil works, training requirements r-d
studies were to be financed by the Government. Bidding documents for equip-
ment were prepared by MOC assisted by foreign experts financed by UNDP.



- 3 -
Equipment was procured by the China National Technical Import Corporation in
cooperation with HOC in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement. HOC
was also responsible for civil works' implementation using the respective
construction bureau at each port site.
1.7      Prices offered by equipment manufacturers under ICB were unusually
low, especially those of the container 2/ and transtainer cranes. This was
mainly because industrial countries were eager to catch an early foothold in
the Chinese market which was recently opened to the foreign manufacturers. As
a result of these low prices, the Government requested, and the Bank agreed.
to cancel US$55.0 million equivalent on May 10, 1984 and US$1.03 million equi-
valent on October 27, 1987 from the loan, thus reducing its amount to US$67.97
million equivalent. Subsequently, the project has been successfully completed
in its entirety at a total cost of US$266.15 million equivalent as compared to
the appraisal estimate of US$427.40 million equivalent. Due to the high
interest rate of the loan (11.6Z), China has already repaid US$61.5 equivalent
out of a total disbursement of US$67.97 million equivalent. At the time of
appraisal, the project was scheduled for completion by December 31, 1986.
Although 96Z of the project was completed by the above date, the remaining 4Z,
mainly purchase of an additional container crane, were completed more than two
years later.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification
2.1      At the request of the Chinese Government that the Bank assist in port
improvement, an identification mission visited China in October 1980. Key
issues highlighted by the mission included: (a) the ad hoc nature of port
development planning undertaken at the project ports; (b) the inadequacy of
local construction cost data; (c) the need for additional data before the
project could be appraised; (d) the need to provide assistance to the Harbour
Administration Bureaus (HAB) concerning Bank ICB procedures; (e) the need for
an independent check of the design of proposed projects although designs by
local institutes seemed generally adequate; (f) construction of ongoing civil
works appeared reasonably satisfactory, however, supervision was insufficient;
and (g) port finances appeared to be well-managed. The mission identified a
project that included a coal terminal at Huangpu, container terminals at
Huangpu and Tianjin (for which construction already started) and at Shanghai
(for which construction was scheduled to start in mid 1981) as well as
container and coal handling equipment, dredging of access channels and prepa-
ration of port master plans.
2.2      MOC was to be responsible for project preparation.  Items financed by
the Bank, mainly equipment, were to be procured under contracts awarded based
on ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Civil works that had already
started, were depigned by MOC, implemented by the respective Construction
2/ Container cranes procured under this project cost about US$1.5 million
equivalent each whereas, during the same period, container cranes under
Bank port projects in other countries cost about US$3.5 million
equivalent each.



Bureau at each port site, and supervised by the respective Harbor
Administration Bureau's full-time engineers, and occasionally by MOC. This
arrangement proved to be satisfactory.
2.3      A preappraisal mission visited China in March 1981.  The mission:
(a) prepared an Action Plan for Government consideration including a port
development study for major Chinese ports; and (b) updated the findings of the
identification mission on the basis of revised data provided by the Chinese
authorities as regards project components and costs. The mission recommended
that designs be checked in details either by MOC or by an independent party,
supervision of works be strengthened, and assistance should be provided to
upgrade dredging management and control. Based on agreement between the
mission and MOC, independent British and American consultants were retained to
assist MOC in the preparation of tender documents for equipment; the
Consultants' services were financed by UNDP. The British consultants were
responsible for equipment for the container terminals at the three ports,
while the American consultants were responsible for equipment for the coal
terminal at Huangpu port. The British Consultants used a group of engineers
from Felixstowe Port (UK). Consultants' performance was satisfactory.
B. ApPraisal
2.4      The Bank appraisal mission visited China from July 5 to August 5,
1981. The mission updated once more project costs on the basis of cost esti-
mates prepared by the design bureaus for civil works, and on world prices for
the equipment involved. The project cost, including contingencies, technical
assistance, training and long-term port development studies was estimated at
US$427 million equivalent, of which US$135 million equivalent in foreign
currency. The Government decided to finance all civil works costs from its
own resources and consequently requested that the Bank finance only the
foreign exchange cost of the equipment to be procured under the project. That
decision was based on MOC recognizing the complications involved in applying
ICB procedures for civil works at that stage, especially since at the time of
appraisal, civil works were already under construction. The mission reported
that (a) MOC was reluctant to have the long-term studies included in the
proposed project description regardless of the financing source; (b) HOC
contemplated entering into a loan agreement with the Bank but did not consider
Project Agreements with the project ports to be desirable; and (c) HOC
preferred that it select, control and monitor the source, scope and duration
of the technical assistance. In addition, the mission reported the following
difficultiesT (a) information on cost of specific operations within the three
ports and on intermodal railwaylport aspects were incomplete; and (b) there
was a clear hesitation on the part of the ports, MOC and the Ministry of
Railways to provide anything but historic data on basic assumptions underlying
projections and estimates provided by the three ports.
2.5      While in China, the appraisal mission discussed procurement issues
with the Communication Bureau of the State Capital Construction Commission
(SCCC). These includeds (a) access to labor in civil construction; (b)
access to local materials; (c) participation in tenders; (d) foreign person-
nel; (e) arbitration; and (f) price escalation.



- 5 -
2.6      A post appraisal mission visited China in November 1981 to review
with MOC various outstanding matters necessary to complete appraisal and in
particulars (a) collect more information on the China National Arbitration
Council (CNAC); (b) discuss Government training proposals; (c) obtain further
information from MOC on its past and planned efforts to study the problems of
ports and estuaries; (d) investigate the legal aspects of the proposed project
including the degree of autonomy enjoyed by the HABs as well as review their
charters; and (e) assess the unequivalent need for a project agreement or
agree to an alternative acceptable mechanism. The mission's findings and
recommendation were subsequently included in the Yellow and Green Cover
Reports.
C. Negotiations
2.7      Negotiations were difficult and time consuming mainly because China
was unfamiliar with the Bank's role as a development institution. Originally
the Bank invited the Government for loan negotiations in Washington starting
January 11, 1982. However, negotiations were postponed at Government request
to allow for a Bank pre-negotiation mission to visit China and discuss the
Green Cover Staff Appraisal Report, the draft President Report and the draft
Loan Agreement. The visit took place in February 1982 and although discus-
sions seemed to have been tough, they were successful in clarifying to
Government a number of points in the documents, and in identifying the major
issues that needed to be resolved during negotiations. However, it was clear
that the Governments (a) wanted to limit as much as possible the Bank's role
in development strategy and that its position on this matter goes beyond the
confines of the port project; and (b) viewed this project, and the conditions
surrounding it, as setting a precedent which would apply to other projects for
some years to come.
2.8      Negotiations started in Washington on March 12, 1982 and continued
through March 22, 1982; they were suspended at Government request mainly as a
result of problems encountered in the following areas:
(a) project definition: the Chinese insisted on a narrow project defini-
tion consisting only of the components to be financed by the Bank;
(b) studies: the Chinese were extremely reluctant to any studies being
carried out in the near future; and
(c) cofinancings the Chinese refused the offers from Norway and Sweden.
There was seemingly general unwillingness on the Chinese side to seek
cofinancing in Bank-financed projects.
2.9      Later, negotiations were resumed in Beijing from April 29 to Hay 15,
1982 without sufficient progress that would allow resuming formal negotiations
of the proposed loan. The fundamental problem was the access to, and breadth
of, information which would be shared with the Bank. It should be emphasized
that during project appraisal, the Government provided the Bank with informa-
tion about the operations and finances of the whole of the three ports, how-
ever, afterwards, the Government took a firm position not to commit itself,
formally and in a legal binding way, to continue to give the Bank such broad



- 6 -
access to information about matters not directly related to project invest-
ments. The Government was thus only ready to provide full information on the
Cargo Handling Corporations (CHCs) which would operate the project facilities.
2.10     During the period May to September 1982, the Bank and the Government
exchanged several telexes with the objective of amending the draft legal docu-
ments in a manner that would satisfy both parties. When this was achieved,
negotiations, in their third session, were resumed in Washington startti-g
September 14, 1982 and were successfully completed on September 16, 1982 for a
proposed loan of US$124 million equivalent with an interest rate of 11.6Z and
a closing date of June 30, 1987. During negotiations the Government agreed to
Bank recommendation as regards certain studies, and the Bank agreed to
Government views that limits information to be provided by the three ports to
those directly related to facilities and equipment included in the project.
This did not have any adverse effect on project implementation or supervision.
In fact, the Government undertook, under the follow-up Bank-financed port
projects (para. 1.3), to provide the Bank with all data related to the whole
port, including financial, operational, managerial... etc. data. Agreements
were reached during negotiations on project components as set in the SAR
(para. 2.12(a) and (b), training (para. 2.12(c) and studies (para. 2.12(d)),
as well as the financial and technical covenants (Annex 2). The loan was
approved by the Board on November 2, 1982 and the legal documents signed on
November 16, 1982. The loan became effective on February 2, 1983.
D. Proiect Objectives and Description
2.11     The main objective of the Government's five-year national economic
development plan for the period 1982-86 was to promote investments in the
transport sector that would prevent the sector from becoming a serious bottle-
neck to the country's economic development. Since ports have a special
position not only in the transfer of resources between North and South China
but also as the gateways to foreign markets and to foreign sources of equip-
ment and technology, the Government, in fulfillment of the above objective,
has approved major investment programs at the three project ports of Huangpu,
Shanghai and Tianjin for the modernization and expansion of facilities. Thus,
the objective of the project was to meet short-term requirements in those
three most important ports of China while Government evolves a long-term
strategy for meeting the country's requirements for port facilities through
the remainder of the century. Coal handling facilities in Huangpu, and
container handling facilities in Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianjin were accorded
high priority in the five-year plan. Consequently, their modernization and
operational efficiency improvement were considered vital parts of the project.
Also, in preparation for future investments the project included a containeri-
zation study of the hinterlands of the three ports. All above objectives have
been adequately met except as regards the quality of the above and the imple-
mentation of its recommendations (see Annex 2).
2.12     The principal components of the project were:
(a) Huangpu Coal Terminal (Map 15817):



(i)  construction of a 440 m long deep water berth capable of accom-
modating two coal carriers of up to 35,000 dwt each, a 400 m
shallow draft berth for loading coal in barges, auxiliary
buildings, and infrastructure;
(ii)  reclamation of the area required for the stockpile yard and
paving of roadways;
(iii)  dredging in front of the coal berth and the barge berth to the
required depth;
(iv)  procurement of coal handling equipment; and
(v)  design and supervision of construction.
(b) Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianiin Container Terminals (Maps 15845, 115815
and 15813);
(i)  deep water container berths 470 m long at Huangpu and 890 m long
at Tianjin, (construction of both started before project
appraisal) and 424 m long at Shanghai;
(ii)  reclamation, consolidation and paving of the area required for
the container stacking yards;
(iii)  dredging of the basins in front of the berths to the required
depth;
(iv)  construction of railway container freight stations (CFSs), road-
way CFSs and the rest of the required ancillary buildings and
infrastructure;
(v)  procurement of computer and container handling equipment; and
(vi)  design and supervision of construction.
(c) Training
(i)  training of personnel in operating procedures for the coal
terminal at Huangpu, and the container terminals at Huangpu,
Shanghai and Tianjin; and
(ii)  training of personnel for the establishment of computerized
management information systems for corntainer operations in
Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianjin;
(d) Studies
(i)  carrying out a containerization study of the hinterlands of the
ports of Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianjin; and
(ii)  carry out a study of the annual operating costs during at least
the first year of operation of the facilities constructed under
the project in each of the three ports.



2.13     The Bank loan was expected to finance-I computer equipment and coal
and container handling equipment. Civil works design, construction and super-
vision, training and studies were expected to be financed by the Government.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
A. Project Implementation
3.1      Implementation of all civil works was the responsibility of MOC using
the respective Navigation Engineering Construction Company (NECC) 31 in each
port as its contractor. Construction was supervised by the respective Harbour
Administration Bureau (HAB) using full-time engineers with the overall super-
vision provided by MOC. This arrangement proved to be satisfactory and the
quality of the finished works was good. Civil works were all financed by the
Government on the bases of direct orders to the appropriate NEC. Construction
was completed on schedule as shown in Charts 3.1 to 3.4. Minor problems were
encountered during construction and were dealt with in due time without loss
of time or additional cost. Such problems are usually encountered in port
projects of this type and magnitude. In particular the soil condition at
Tianjin container terminal was known to be weak; however, because of the
adequate design made by the First Navigation Engineering Design Institute and
the good work carried out by the First Navigation Engineering Construction
Company, consolidation of soil was excellently done and no settlement has
occurred at the container stacking yard during the past three years since
construction completion.
3.2      Cargo handling equipment was grouped in appropriate bidding packages
by MOC and procured by the China National Technical Import Corporation
(CNTIEC) in collaboration with MOC. CNTIEC, which is an independent body not
under MOC, was assisted in the preparation of tender documents by British and
American consultants agreed with the Bank. Tender documents were prepared in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement under ICE and were
reviewed by the Bank. They were published in May 1983, bids were received in
July 1983 and suppliers were chosen in September 1983. All contracts, except
that for computer equipment, were signed before the end of 1983. Qualifying
domestic manufacturers received a preference in bid evaluation of 152 of the
cif price or the import duty whichever was the lower. Table 3.1 gives details
of equipment purchased under the original tender, and dater of delivery.
3.3      Prices offered by the manufacturers for the supply of equipment were
about 60? lower than the appraisal estimate. This was mainly because of the
fierce competition among producers in industrialized countries, in particular
Japan, to gain an early foothold in the Chinese market which seemed, at that
time, to have large potential for foreign suppliers. This special circum-
stance of such low prices may not be repeated in the future.4I Manufacturers
3/ Previously called Construction Bureaus.
4/ The price of the additional container crane referred to in para. 3.11
was 60Z higher than the price of container cranes purchased previously
for this project.



from China, USA, UK, Japan, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Australia, Yugoslavia,
Belgium, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Romania, Finland and Hungary submitted bids
(see Table 3.1 for awards). In addition, since the original contracts
amounted to about US$50 million equivalent as compared to the Bank loan of
US$124 million equivalent, the Bank agreed to Government request to cancel
US$55 million from the loan and to purchase additional equipment needed for
the three ports totalling about US$18 million equivalent. During the
preparation of this Completion Report, the Government as well as representa-
tives of each port, expressed their appreciation for the benefits of the
international competitive bidding, not only because of the lower prices
offered but also as a result of the quality of foreign equipment being much
superior to those manufactured locally.
3.4      During tests carried out to assess the durability and efficiency of
the equipment, certain equipment showed some defects mainly as a result of
incorrect welding, leakage of oil and defective electrical systems. In parti-
cular, the two container cranes financed by the Government for Huangpu port
and built in Shanghai in 1982 as the first Chinese model encountered major
problems. These two cranes were not part of the project. In general, the
local and foreign suppliers of project equipment carried out all necessary
repairs during the guarantee period, however, some minor equipment is still
not performing completely satisfactorily. The situation is aggravated by the
fact that a big percentage of spare parts provided under the project for
equipment manufactured outside China has been consumed since equipment was
purchased. The ports reported in their reports on project implementation
experience that they were unable to buy additional spare parts on their own
because of China's rigid and restrictive purchase procedures. Measures
proposed to be taken by the Bank to overcome this situation are outlined in
para. 7.3.
3.5      The containerization study (para. 2.12(f)) of the hinterlands of the
three ports to identify inland intermodal terminals, other facilities and
transport equipment required to optimize door to door transport potential of
the containerization of cargo through these ports was carried out on schedule
and was completed on December 31, 1984. Conclusions of the study as well as
its weaknesses are given in Annex 1. However, the operating costs study was
delayed until financing became available from the Japanese Grant Agreement in
1989 as part of the subsequent Ningbo and Shanghai Ports Project.
B. Training
3.6      Training under the project was financed by the Government.  The
program was agreed with the Bank and proved to be adequate. It introduced new
technology to the staff and labor and enabled the ports to handle efficiently
modern equipment for unloading/loading containers and coal. However, training
as envisaged, was limited to technical staff and operational people. This
should be rectified in future projects by providing training to financial
managers and economic planners. Training outside China was carried out mainly
in Japan as arranged by MOC and equipment suppliers, and concentrated on
operating and maintaining container handling equipment and computer equipment.
In addition, two groups, each consisting of 20 men, were sent to Antwerp for



- 10 -
75 days, one in March 1984 and another in July 1986, to be trained in opera-
tion of container terminals in lieu of inviting foreign experts to conduct
courses in China. Training in China was carried out on the job and through
local training centers and technical institutes. Computer operators in the
three ports were trained in Japan and their training was completed on schedule
by December 31, 1986.
3.7      As stipulated in the SAR, the Japanese manufacturer of the coal
handling equipment for Huangpu trained 20 people on the job; the latter acted
thereafter as trainers. Other technicians and skilled labor (crane drivers,
ship-loaders etc.) were trained on similar equipment in different coal
terminals in China.
3.8      In Shanghai port, staff and workers were trained mainly as follows:
(a) drivers, skilled labor and stevedores for three to six months in the newly
constructed Shanghai Harbor Workers Training Center which started operation in
August 1986; (b) repair and maintenance people for two years in the Shanghai
Harbor Special School; and (c) senior engineers and management and administra-
tion staff (about 100 every year) for three year courses in Shanghai Harbor
College. The above training program exceeded that stipulated in the SAR.
3.9      In Tianjin port, staff and workers were trained as follows:
(a) drivers and repair and maintenance people in TPA's Technical School (about
200 annually); (b) technical, administration and management staff in TPA's
Special Profession School; and (-) civil, mechanical and electrical engineers
and computer specialists in China Center Television Education Program which
accepts candidates from all over China. The Tianjin Port Development Center
started operation in 1987 and includes a technical school, workers training
school and a television education school. The above training program also
exceeded that stipulated in the SAR.
C. Proiect Costs and Loan Disbursement
3.10     During appraisal, the project was estimated to cost Y 748.2 million
(US$427.4 million equivalent at a rate of exchange of US$1 - Y 1.75). The
actual cost was Y 651.7 million (US$266.1 million equivalent on the bases of
rates of exchange prevailing between 1982 and 1988). The main reasons for the
lower project cost were: (a) the unusually low bid prices for equipment; anf
(b) the devaluation of the Yuan from US$1 = Y 1.75 in 1982 to US$1 - Y 3.722
in 1986, 1987 and 1988. Details of the comparison between the appraisal
estimate and the actual costs (including design, supervision, training.
customs duties and contingencies) are given in Table 3.2 and are summarized
below:

/a   Including the additional equipment referred to in
para. 3.3 above.
3.11     Actual disbursement as compared with the appraisal estimate is given
in Table 3.3. Disbursements lagged behind the original schedule as a result
of Government delays in submitting applications for disbursement. The closing
date was extended from June 30, 1987 to June 30, 1988 to allow for the
purchase of additional equipment. Actually 98.82 of the reduced loan was
disbursed by the original closing date. The remaining 1.2? of the loan was
disbursed in March 1989 to cover the last payment on an additional container
crane for Huangpu port. The crane was not included in the original project
list of goods but could be purchased thanks to the savings on the rest of the
equipment purchases (para. 3.3). Due to the relatively high interest rate of
the loan (11.6S), China has already repaid US$61.5 million equivalent out of a
total disbursement on March 31, 1989 of US$67.97 million equivalent.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Organization and Management
4.1      At the time of project appraisal and loan negotiations all the three
ports were under MOC. On January 1, 1985 Tianjin was put under the
Municipality of Tianjin and was granted technical and managerial independence
and an acceptable degree of financial autonomy. However the State Planning
Commission (SPC) and MOC are still responsible for long term planning as well
as the authority of revie"ing and approving any major investment project that
would cost more than Y 30 millicn (para. 5.2). Shanghai and Huangpu became
independent from MOC on January 1, 1986 and January 1, 1987 respectively but
with somewhat lesser degree of decentralization than Tianjin; details are
given in paras. 5.1 and 5.2.
4.2      On January 1, 1987 Huangpu port was granted independence from MOC and
was put under the Municipality of Guangzhou City. On December 18, 1987
Huangpu port and Guangzhou port (which was always under the Munici;ility)
joined together under one organization called the Guangzhou Harbour Bureau
(GHB).



- 12 -
4.3      The Director of each of the three ports as well as his deputies are
now appointed by the respective Municipality after consultation with MOC.
Originally each port used to pay its surplus income to the State which in turn
financ4d 100S of capital investments on a grant basis.  Now, SHB psys Y 11.32
million annually to the State, Shanghai Port Bureau (SPB) pays Y 72.55 million
annually to the State up to year 1990 and Tianjin Port Authority (TPA) pays
nothing. The three ports now keep the balance of their income; they finance
their major expenditures without any assistance from MOP. The effect of
decentralization on the financial position of each port is detailed in
para. 5.5. Decentralization seems a step in the right direction and has its
merits but it is early to judge its effect on the efficiency of port opera-
tions and the financial position of port enterprises especially since:
(a) decentralization is in effect only up to end of 1990 after which date the
State will reassess the degree of decentralization to be given to each indivi-
dual port; and (b) ports do not set their own tariffs. Decentralization as
now stauds could be improved by allowing the ports to set their own tariffs in
order to be able to meet their cash flow requirements and compete on the basis
of quality of services and the cost of providing them (para. 7.6).
B. Traffic
4.4      Overall traffic is increasing rapidly in the three ports as shown in
the following table. Actual traffic for 1985 compares favorably with the
appraisal forecast for that year. Actual traffic for 1987 was almost the same
as the SAR forecast for 1990 except for Tianjin.

design capacity of 4.0 million tons, and as compared to that handled during
1987 of 1.78 million tons. About 80Z of the coal was reloaded in barges and
20S on railway wagons and trucka. The Huangpu container terminal handled
83,613 TEU in 1988 as compared to 57,479 TEU in 1987. Shanghai container
terminal (the project berths) handled 167,000 TEU in 1988 as compared to
118,000 TEU in 1987. Tianjin container terminal (the project berths) handled
118,986 TEU in 1988 as compared to 80,294 TEU in 1987. Although container
traffic through the project container terminals did not reach its full capa-
city, it is steadily increasing, but was still below appraisal estimate in
1988 by about 102 in Huangpu and 501 in Tianjin as a result of recent decline
in importation through Tianjin port due to changes in trade policy of the
Government. The impact on the project of the actual traffic being less than
the SAR estimate is demonstrated in Chapter VI. Details of container traffic
through container terminals provided under the project are given below:

C. Productivity

is good. The followin, table gives certain performance indicators for 1988;
these compare favorably with international standards:

/c Same as SAR requirement.
/d One of the cranes financed by the Government and manufactured locally has
been always idle waiting for repairs.
Le Traffic has not yet reached full capacity.
!f Long stay in port is due to inadequate feeder train services needed to
evacuate containers intended for the interior (70Z). The remaining 30?
intended for the city stay in the port 7 to 10 days which is acceptable.
4.6      Importers still tend to use the port not only as a transit area but
also as a storage facility until the cargoes are actually needed. Thus they
keep the containers on the stacking yards in the three ports for excessive
periods. One of the main reasons for this unacceptable situation is that the
container storage fee is unrealistically low.5/ Bank supervision missions
drew MOC's and MOP's attention to this on several occasions but the situation
remained the same. The other reason is the inadequacy of intermodal transpor-
tation capacities, in particular those of the railways and highways, needed to
evacuate the containers to the interior hinterland as quickly as possible.
The benefits of containerization are therefore not fully realized resulting in
significant loss to the economy. Urgent measures are thus needed to improve
rail and road networks serving the ports. This became more imperative in
light of the heavy investment in port projects and the recent decentralization
granting more autonomy to the ports.
D. Performance of the Bank
4.7      Performance of the Bank as regards project objectives, components,
design and supervision was adequate. In particular, the Bank's supervisory
effort was good as a result of maintaining continuity under the same staff;
this contributed largely to the project being problem free. However, the Bank
should have not agreed to Government's request to use the loan surplus to
purchase the additional container crane (para. 3.10) because that request came
5/ Four days free for inbound containers and zero for outbound ones, then
a fee of US$1.3 per day per container up to day 14 after which date the
port can move the containers out but almost never do so.

very late and resulted in major delays in loan disbursement. During prepara-
tion of this Completion Report, MOC and the managers of the three ports
expressed to the Bank's mission their appreciation for the technical assis-
tance provided by Bank staff who participated in project preparation and
implementation. They reiterated thats (a) cooperation with the Bank has been
excellent; (b) they benefitted very much from the visits of the Bank super-
vision missions, however, they prefer that those visits would have been at
shorter intervals; about six months between visits; (c) disbursements were on
time without undue delays; (d) they appreciate the benefits of international
competitive bidding for equipment purchase; and (e) they consider project
completion reports an excellent tool to judge the soundness and justification
of each project and to learn the lessons derived from it.
E. Performance of the Borrower
4.8      Loan negotiations were time consuming and required considerable
effort from Bank staff mainly as a result of China's unfamiliarity with the
Bank. However, the atmosphere thereafter was relaxed and cooperation with the
Bank was good. Except for carrying out a study of the annual operating costs
of each port (para. 3.5), the Government fulfilled all its obligations under
the Loan Agreement; these were mainly standard ones (see Annex 2), and already
repaid US$61.5 million equivalent ahead of schedule out of a total loan of
US$67.97 million equivalent (para. 3.10). The Government responded to Bank
recommendations as regards employment of experts to review tender documents
for equipment, ICB, training and studies. Each of the three ports prepared
and submitted to the Bank parts of the required project completion report
concerning project implementation experience in their respective ports. The
success achieved under the project is to a large extent attributed to the high
degree of commitment at all levels of Government to the project, especially as
a result of their active participation in project planning, design and imple-
mentation.
F. Performance of Contractors, Equipment Suppliers and Consultants
4.9      The Government and the Bank are satisfied with the performance of:
(a) the local institutions that were responsible for project design as well as
the local contractors that were responsible for construction of civil works;
this judgment is supported by the quality of work produced and the time taken
for its completion; (b) the foreign suppliers of equipment, the degree of
efficiency of this equipment, and the on time repair of defects discovered at
the guarantee periods and even thereafter; and (c) the consultants who
reviewed tender documents for cargo handling equipment. The Government
expressed its disappointment for the quality of some equipment provided by
local manufacturers and undertook to take the necessary measures to improve
their production in future, including encouraging the creation of joint
ventures with foreign manufacturers. This is a step in the right direction.
It also expressed its intention to use foreign consultants in future as will
be needed.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Decentralization
5.1      At the time of appraisal, the HOC controlled these three ports at the
State level, but during project implementation, the management and financial
administration of the three ports was decentralized from the State to the
local Municipal Government. Under the new arrangements, authority for
administering each of the ports is placed under the dual leadership of the
State and municipal government. The municipal government assumes most of the
responsibility through the port authority, which handles day to day manage-
ment, operation, construction, and development of the port. However, major
projects or plans affecting the long-term development of the port still are
approved by the State through MOC, although the port bears the financial obli-
gations for its own development. Until decentralization, individual ports
were unable/not authorized to provide information on theLr respective ports or
discuss broader issues (para. 2.4). To successfully intagrate the administra-
tion and development of the port into the municipal government without placing
a financial burden on the latter, a financial restructuring of the port was
carried out. This restructuring served to enhance the internal cash genera-
tion of the port by reducing or, in the case of Tianjin, eliminating the
port's tax obligations and its contributions to the Government.
5.2      The managerial and financial restructuring was applied differently to
each of the three project ports. The following table summarizes the key
financial terms for each port along with the size of its project that needs
State approval.

B. Past Performance
5.3      The financial performance of the three project ports for the six
years ended in 1986 has been very good and far better thaa the results which
were forecasted during appraisal. During this period, operating revenues grew
at average annual rates of 18? for the three ports compared to forecasted
rates of 4Z. Since the total volume of traffic handled at the three ports
during this period was not very different from the levels forecast at
appraisal (para. 4.4), (except in 1986 due to lack of forecast data), the
difference between forecast and actual results must be attributed to the port
charges. The forecasts were developed at a time when the country had a policy
of controlling prices at the state level and, as a result, price increases
were rare. In addition, the country had for the previous three decades
experienced very minor price changes due to inflation, and there was no indi-
cation that either operating control of the ports or the rate of inflation
would change in the near future. Therefore, the financial forecasts presented
in the appraisal assumed that: (a) the port charges would remain almost
constant; and (b) the rate of inflation would be minor. These assumptions,
although reasonable at the time, now appear very conservative due to a series
of unforeseen changes. Starting 1985, MOF revised its policy of port users'
charges to raise additional capital for renovation of the port sector. The
effect of the policy on the project ports was to increase cargo loading/
unloading charges mainly on foreign ships.  Between December 1985 to August
1986, there were four revisions making a total increase of 114?. In addi-
tion, the rapidly growing economy resulted in a higher rate of inflation than
had been predicted during the appraisal. During the same period, an average
allowance of 0.4? was made in the revenue forecast in the SAR compared with
4.4? real average annual increase. The combined effect of the realized
traffic hikes and much slower inflation on revenues can be seen in the average
per unit revenue for the three ports which increased at an average rate of
12.72 (compared to a negligible increase forecast in the SAR). The highlights
of selected years for the actual financial results of the three ports as
compared with the forecast in the SAR between 1981-86 are summarized below.
No SAR forecast was given for 1987 and 1988, but the actual and estimated
financial results given by the three ports for these two years are reported in
Table 5.1.

5.4      At the same time that the ports were realizing significant price
increases, the management was carefully controllinRoperating costs. Since the
growth rates of operating costs were less than the growth rates of revenues,
the profitability of the three ports, as measured by the working ratio, the
operating ratio and the rate of return on average net fixed assets in opera-
tion, improved dramatically. Actual unit operating revenues for all commodi-
ties during 1980-88, show an average increase of 3.32 p.a. for Huangpu port,
9.32 p.a. for Shanghai port, and 9.22 for Tianjin port. Within the same
period, unit operating costs only increased by 1.82 p.a., 7.6Z p.a., and 5.42
p.a., respectively. Increases in average unit handling costs, a major item in
unit operating costs, were even less than increases in revenue and in overall



- 20 -
unit operating costs. Actual increases in unit handling costs were 0.42 p.a.,
4.6Z p.a., and 2.92 p.a. for the three ports, respectively. The improvement
in productivity of the three ports is the result of the decentralization of
management and administration of the ports. This move provided a great deal
of incentive to the port authorities by encouraging each working unit of the
port to fully utilize existing facilities through linking part of salary pay-
ments (namely cash bonus) to productivities. A comparisons of the actual and
SAR forecast operating results for the three ports is presented in the

5.5      The actual total funds flows between 1981-86, show substantial
increases for Huangpu and Tianjin ports, and to a lesser extent for Shanghai
Port compared with the SAR estimate. The substantial increases of capital
inflows and outflows for Huangpu and Tianjin ports are the result of the
second follow-on project for those two ports, and the preferential terms to
Tianjin port after decentralization (para. 5.2). The actual results of funds
flows for the three ports also show a better performance than the SAR esti-
mate. These results are largely due to consistent tariff increases and
excellent cost control measures (para. 5.3 and 5.4). Detailed statements are
shown in Table 5.3 and are summarized briefly as follows:

5.6      The total volume of traffic handled at the three ports during 1981-85
was not so different from the SAR forecasts.  However, the profits for each of
the ports were higher than predicted due to the financial restructuring after
decentralization and the tariff increases. Because net fixed assets were not
revalued, a higher rate of return was achieved on average net fixed assets,
especially in the case of Shanghai port.
C. Present Financial Position
5.7      The financial position of the three ports was sound at the end of
1988. Current assets substantially exceeded current liabilities, particularly
in the Huangpu and Tianjin Ports. All three ports had a high percentage of
net current assets in the form of cash or the equivalent; at Huangpu port it
was 85.4Z, at Shanghai port, 68.3Z, and at Tianjin port, 83.9Z (Table 5.2).
The salient points of the balance sheets are as follows:

5.8      Under the present financial arrangements, the three ports enjoy a
very healthy range of liquidity, leverage, and profitability ratios
(Tables 5.1-5.3). However, the new responsibilities of the ports for financ-
ing their capital programs themselves have not yet had much impact on cash
flows; these will weigh more heavily in the future. In addition, the current
preferential tax terms granted by the government will expire in 1990 and it is
not yet clear whether future terms will be favo'able to the ports. Therefore,
new financial terms (para. 5.2) will have to be established to forecast the
funds flow and balance sheet items after 1990. There are many scenarios to
chose from, and it is essential for the ports to prepare and to make available
more qualified personnel to carry out theses kinds of scenario analysis once
the offer of the State is known (para. 7.7).
VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
6.1      The economic analysis presented in this report is based on a reevalu-
ation of data on traffic, operational performance, economic cost, and project
benefits at each project facility since the SAR estimates were made. The
revised information on traffic is based primarily on the updated traffic
figures used in new projections for the Bank-financed follow-on port projects
that have been appraised after the Three Ports project. The methodology used
in the economic analysis for this PCR is similar to that used in the SAR and
is summarized below. Briefly:
(a) capital investment and maintenance costs have been revised to 1988
prices and included in the costs stream;
(b) the benefits stream, also in 1988 prices, consists of savings in port
handling, ship port time (berth and waiting) and cargo port time



- 23 -
(berth and waiting) except that in the PCR, savings from lightering
arising from port congestion have also been included;
(c) a project life of 20 years has been assumed, but whereas in the SAR
the capital investment period for all berths were assumed to be 1981
to 1985 and for the container berth at Huangpu port from 1981 to
1986, in the PCR, the capital investment period for all berths was
1980 to 1987; and,
(d) benefits start to accrue from 1986 for all berths and from 1987 for
the container berth at Huangpu port with the exception that in the
PCR benefits for the coal berths accrue from 1987.
After reassessing these revised data, the overall reevaluated economic rate of
return (REER) for this project is slightly higher (34X) than the SAR estimate
(29Z), however, that for each project berth(s) was quite different. The
detailed analysis is discussed in Annex 3.
6.2      A comparison of RERRs and the SAR estimates reveals that the RERR for
Huangpu was slightly lower, that of Shanghai much higher, and that of Tianjin
was slightly higher than the SAR estimate for each port. At Huangpu, the
actual bulk (coal) and break bulk (general cargo and containerized) traffic
was much higher than estimated in the SAR. However, benefits arising from the
increase in traffic was offset by the reduction in average daily ship cost in
port. At Shanghai port, the reassessment of the number of existing centainer
berths from three to two, brought about by the increase in ship length of
vessels calling at the port, has the effect of reducing the number of berths
available to ships; i.e. the revised ship waiting time (without project) has
to be increased to reflect the reduced availability of berth days. This
accounts for the much higher RERR of Shanghai port. The RERR of Tianjin port
did not deviate much from the SAR estimate (3Z higher) because the use of
container berths by the port to handle non-container traffic as and when the
berths were available.
6.3      Looking at the three ports together, there are five major factors
which positively influence the RERR: (a) the increase in average container
shipment size; (b) increase in coal berth capacity; (c) increase in container
cargo value; (d) decrease in cargo handling costs; and (e) the downward revi-
sion in the number of existing container berths at Shangha!. port. On the
other hand, these factors were offset by the negative effects of: (a) reduced
average daily ship costs in port; and (b) lower container traffic in Shanghai
and Tianjin ports. The resulting impact was the RERR of 342 for the three
ports collectively compared with 29Z estimated at time of appraisal (see
operating parameter, para. 8 of Annex 3 and Table 6.8).
6.4      The RERR and SAR estimates for each major project element in terms of
the proportion of total economic costs, economic rate of return, sensitivity
analysis and net present value (NPV) are given below.

VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1       This first project is a complete success as regards its design,
implementation, objectives and achievements. Maintaining the same staff to
carry out supervision on a continuous basis contributed to the project being
problem free mainly as a result of the technical assistance provided by the
staff and the working relations established between them and their counter-
parts in the ports. This trend should be sustained and encouraged in future.
The project has been completed on time at a total cost lower than the
appraisal estimate by 382 (in US dollar terms) or 132 (in Yuan terms). This
reduction in project cost was caused by the bid for equipment under ICB being
unusually low as compared to prevailing world prices. The low prices resulted
in the amount of the loan being reduced from US$124 million equivalent to
US$67.97 million equivalent. The project achieved all its original objectives
and yielded an overall economic rate of return of 342 which is higher than the



- 25 -
appraisal estimate of 292. In addition, all the loan conditions have been met
(Annex 2). On the date originally set for the closing of the loan, 98.82 of
the reduced loan had been disbursed, the remaining 1.22 was to finance an
additional crane for Huangpu port. The projects at Shanghai and Tianjin were
actually completed on the original schedule. Putting the three ports projects
in one package deprived the Shanghai and Tianjin projects the privilege of
showing zero disbursement lag at the closing date. The Bank should not have
agreed to the purchase of this additional crane after the original project has
been nearly completed. It would have been preferable to have provided finance
for this additional crane in a sequential loan.
7.2      This project was the first Bank lending operation to China in the
ports subsector. Loan negotiations were tough and time consuming. They
involved three sessions; the first started on January 11, 1982 and the last
completed on September 15, 1982. This was mainly because China was unfamiliar
with Bank regulations and procedures and its role as a development institu-
tion. China had initially hoped that the Bank would bend its rules, but the
Bank was unwilling to grant it special treatment different from that granted
to other countries. Now, that the project has been completed, the Government,
as well as the managers of each of the three ports, expressed their apprecia-
tion for the technical assistance provided by Bank staff during project prepa-
ration and implementation, as well as for the benefits derived from interna-
tional competitive bidding. Government request that the period between super-
vision missions be shortened to six months (para. 4.7) is justified because it
would reduce the possibility of major problems happening, encourage port staff
by them feeling that they are not neglected or deserted in their endeavor to
strengthen ports' autonomy.
7.3      The managers of the three ports reportel that heavy equipment, in
particular, the container cranes, the transtainers and the 2.5 t fork lifts
provided under the project from foreign manufacturers proved to be superior to
those manufactured locally. Two container cranes manufactured locally and
financed by the Government because they were not part of the original list of
goods, caused, and are still causing, serious problems as a result of their
low quality and reduced efficiency. The Bank, as well as the Government,
should be careful in future when assessing the durability and efficiency of
heavy equipment manufactured in China. Engineers from Bank Industrial
Divisions should be consulted before the Bank would have no objection that
certain equipment be manufactured locally. Shortage of spare parts started to
cause serious problems after about three years of port operations. Certain
spare parts provided under the project for equipment manufactured outside
China have been totally consumed by now, causing some equipment to remain idle
and others are in poor condition. Some simple imported components have been
manufactured locally, however, others are beyond the know-how of local
industry. The situation is aggravated by China's rigid and restrictive
purchase procedures. In addition it is a usual practice that foreign manufac-
turers offer low prices for their equipment but later charge high prices for
needed spare parts. It is thus recommended that the Bank would look favorably
into: (a) including into future port projects spare parts sufficient to cover
five years of equipment operations, probably in two or three tranches to
provide time for experience in using the equipment; and (b) if possible, use
some surplus of Bank loans provided now for other port projects in China to
provide urgently needed spare parts for equipment purchased under this
project.

7.4      The country's limited communication system and the severe shortage of
transportation capacities, in particular those of the railways, poses a
constraint for the increasing container traffic and inland distribution of
containers. This sho.tcoming interrupts the full functions of container
terminals provided under the project and results in dis3rupting adequate door
to door services. Consequently large number of containers remain in the ports
longer than they should, others have to be unstuffed within the ports' areas.
It is therefore recommended that the Bank consideL financing projects that
would improve the above mentioned situation on the basis of feasibility
studies to be carried out under one of the Bank future transport projects.
7.5      The construction of the ports cannot be isolated from the regional
transport plan, which should link with the national transport plan and the
overall economic development strategy. Traffic at the three ports is
influenced by their respective cargo allocation. The current traffic alloca-
tions. is done largely by HOC central planners in Beijing. The exact basis for
MOC allocation of traffic is not entirely clear, but in principle should be
based on traffic assignments to the least cost mode and routing. To maximize
benefits from capital investments, the construction of specialized berths for
the ports should be complemented by infrastructure development linking the
port to its hinterlands, and should be related to the region's stage of
economic development. To achieve this coordination, a comprehensive (multi-
modal) transport sector study is recommended, to guide planning for major port
developments. A better traffic demand forecast will help avoid the problems
of redesigning throughput capacity after construction has begun, or the
underutilization of berth capacity after project completion.
7.6      The port tariff policy in effect throughout most of China is to apply
the same standard charge, which is controlled by the State, on each commodity
in all ports. The impact of this policy discourages the port authority from
renovating or renewing the existing facilities to provide better services. In
addition, the benefits associated with increased productivity from the new
investments unfairly accrue to the ports' users--ship and cargo owners--rather
than the investors--the port. Therefore, the Bank should recommend to the
Government that port authorities be allowed to set their own port charges
within a certain 7.ange based on the current standard tariff. This will
appropriately distinguish between the quality of services offered by the port
and the cost of providing such services.
7.7      In all ports, the scope of training facilities should be expanded,
not only to cover engineers and operators, but also to cover financial manage-
ment staff and economic planners.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Hinterland Containerization Study
1.       The Comprehensive Transport Research Institute of the State Economic
Commission carried out the study and it was completed in December 1984.   The
study was the first of its kind in China, and it was found to be satisfactory
and thus was accepted by the Bank.
2.       The study described the existing developments for handling containers
at the three ports, and discussed the existing issues in the hinterland
container transportation. The issues were summarized as: lack of hinterland
infrastructure and facilities, lack of technology and trained personnel, and
irrational tariff rates for container movement, besides the lack of
cooperation betwee'n the various departments. The study then forecasted the
future container traffic at the three ports, based on the expected growth in
industry and agriculture, projected the hinterland transport requirement from
that until the year 2000. The study also compared the transport cost of a
container by the various modes for various distances. Interesting results
were concluded from these studies, but no detailed calculations were
presented. These lead to the modal shares of container transport until the
year 2000.
3.       The study then proposed the required inland container freight
stations, how they should be equipped and their best layout. However, the
study did ot examine the adequacy of the various modes only identified that
heavy investments are required for their development.
4.       The study proposed certain measures to strengthen the hinterland
transportation of containers among these are: (a) develop the container
equipment manufacturing industry; (b) provide the required investment for
development of the hinterland infrastructure; (c) gradually modernize
management; (d) improve the transportation organizations in the country and
modernize the various transport policies; (e) rationalize the tariffs for the
various modes and services; (f) speed up the training for container handling.
5.       The study was very useful in assisting the Government to formulate
its future polices in regard to containers, stress the various points in the
subsequent Bank projects and focus the attention on the relative importance of
the various transportation modes.

CHINA
THREE PORTS PROJECT (LOAN 220/-CHA)
PRCJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Traffic
Huangpu Port - Coal
1.       The demand for coal traffic in Huangpu port in 1987 and 1988 was
higher than the SAR estimate by about 20? in 1987 and 54Z in 1988. Based on
current estimates the demand for coal traffic in 1995 will be 52Z higher than
the original forecast [Table 6.1(a)]. These high growth rates are attributed
to two main factors: (a) the extraordinary growth of regional economic
activities in Guangdong province since the early 1980s (averaging 12.4? p.a.
from 1980 to 1986, and reaching 24.3? in 1987); and (b) the deficiency of
energy resources in the main hinterland of the port which requires imports of
coal from other regions. In order to meet the additional traffic demand, the
Guangzhou Harbour Bureau has decided to expand the handling capacity of the
existing coal terminal and build an additional coal terminal as part of the
ongoing second Bank-financed Huangpu port project. The benefits of this
second Bank-financed coal berth project have been separated in the calculation
of benefits to avoid double counting.
Huangpu Port - Container
2.       Despite much higher than anticipated growth of the provincial
economy, container traffic at Huangpu port in 1988 was about 10? below the
level predicted in the SAR as the rate of container penetration of general
cargo trades was less rapid in earlier years. Recently however, growth in the
use of containers has greatly accelerated, with increases in 1987 and 1988 of
41? and 51? respectively. Such phenomenal growth is unlikely to be sustained
and the revised forecasts assume annual growth of 15.5Z--from 1989 to 1990,
62--from 1991 to 1995 and 8.5Z--from 1995 to 2000. The lower future growth is
due to the diversion of traffic from the port as a result of the expected
completion of the double tracking of the railway in January 1989, and the new
exnressway in the early 1990s; both link Guangzhou city and the Special
Economic Zones.
Shanghai Port - Container
3.       Container traffic in 1987 and 1988 through all berthing facilities at
Shanghai port was lower than projected in the SAR, by about 57? and 40?
respectively, despite an actual annual growth rate of total tonnage of 27? and
43? in the same period [Table 6.1(b)]. This was partly the result of slightly
lower than expected growth in general cargo traffic (87? and 94Z of the SAR
estimates for the two years). The lower growth rates of container and general
cargo handling also were due to: (a) lack of coordination between the
construction of transport infrastructure in the hinterland and the port's



ANNEX 3
- 31 -                             Page 2 of 7
containerization development program which limited the use of the container
facilities at the port; and (b) the rather slow rate of commercial penetration
of integrated intermodal logistics management in China. Given the importance
of the Shanghai port to China, container traffic is still expected to grow,
but the revised container traffic for 1990 and 1995 is now expected to be
smaller than originally predicted (four million tons and six million tons vs.
six million tons and seven million tons respectively). The second Bank-
financed project for the port (Ln. 3006-CHA) is paying close attention to the
port's master plan within the context of regional development of the transport
network and services.
Tianjin Port - Container
4.       Container traffic through all berthing facilities at Tianjin port in
1987 and 1988 was lower than the SAR estimate by about 39? and 51? respec-
tively. Because traffic pattern at the port consists of about 80? foreign
trade and imports are always larger than exports, traffic is subject to fluc-
tuations caused by the uncertain conditions of international markets
[Table 6.1(c)]. Considering the lack of integrated coordination in transport
planning among the government agencies [para. 3(b), Anmex 3] and recent
government import restraints due to the deterioration of the international
balance of payments, the future annual container traffic growth is estimated
to be on the average only 5.72 from 1988 to 1995, 13.92--from 1990 to 1995 and
6Z--from 1995 to 2000. This is lower than projected in the SAR, by about 50Z
and 90? for 1990 and 1995. It should be noted, however, that the facilities
can be, and are being, usefully employed for non-containerized operations.
B.  Ship Time Analysis
Coal Carriers
5.       Comparing 1980 and 1988, coal carriers spent an average of 4.1 days
and 5.1 days respectively in Huangpu port, of which the ship waiting time in
the port (non-productive time plus weather stoppage) accounted for 1.45 days
and 3.65 days, respectively (Table 6.2). During the same period, the average
working time per ship (productive time at berth) has decreased from 2.6 days
to 1.4 days. This increase in ship port and ship waiting time, and the
decrease in the ship working time, reflected the rapid increase in coal
traffic demand (para. 1 of Annex 3) associated with increases in coal through-
put capacity at berth. Had the added capacity provided by the project not
taken place, the increase in ship waiting time would have been extremely
larger.
Container Ships
6.       Comparing 1980 with 1988, the average working time for container
ships at berth at Huangpu doubled, reflecting a doubling of average shipment
size. Ship waiting time increased from 1.71 days to 2.43 days between 1987
and 1988 alone, which coincides with a 50? increase in traffic during the same
period. Again, in this case also the increase in ship waiting time would have
been much larger had the extra capacity provided by the project not materia-
lized. In contrast, Shanghai port improved considerably. Average tima spent
at port were reduced from 6.38 days to 1.85 days between 1980 and 1988. Ship



ANNEX 3
- 32 -                          Page 3 of 7
waiting time was reduced from 4.05 days to 1.46 days, and ship working time
reduced from 2.34 days to 0.4 days. At Tianjin port, during the same period,
ship working and ship waiting time were fairly steady (Table 6.2).
C. Berth Operations
Coal Berths
7.       Facilities added by the project increased coal handling capacity of
Huangpu port by 46.12 to 6.34 million tons (unloading: 4.0 million, loading:
2.3 million), however, total volume of ccal distributed through the port in
1988 was 7.1 million tons. Detailed efficiency indicators are shown in Table
6.3(a).
Container Berths
8.       The operating parameters for container berths at the three ports also
differ from the SAR estimates. The detailed indicators used for the economic
reevaluation of each port are shown in Tables 6.3(b) -(d). There are four
main changes in the operating parameters: (a) the number of container berths
(without project) in Shanghai has been reassessed from three (estimated in the
SAR) to two, as a result of the increase in ship length; (b) the average ship-
ment size has been increased; (c) the average daily ship cost in port has been
reduced to reflect actual shipments and current operating costs in the shipp-
ing industry; and (d) cargo value and cargo handling costs have been revised
to reflect current market value on ships calling at these ports. The changes
in operating parameters are highlighted as follows:

D. Economic Costs and Benefits
Economic Costs
9.       Due to price distortions in China, market prices have been adjusted
to reflect real economic costs. In this analysis, several methods were used
to convert financial costs to economic costs (in 1988 prices), depending on
the category of costs.
(a)  For major items such as wharf construction and other large civil
works, each cost component was separately shadow priced by inputs.
The conversion factors for major inputs are: cement/machinery--l.40,
unskilled labor--0.50, and skilled labor--4.00. The other i:nputs are
close to 1.00.
(b)  For the direct foreign costs of imported equipment, a conversion
factor of 1 was used; and
(c)  For other items, aggregate conversion factors are similar to recently
updated figures used in the December 1988 report for Ningbo/Shanghai
and Xiamen port projects.
The results of calculation are provided in Tables 6.4; taxes and duties were
excluded.
10.      In the SAR, the overall effect of shadow pricing project costs was
that economic costs were 4.5Z higher than financial costs; equivalent figures
in the PCR were 76.2Z higher. However, this SAR's ratio would be 84.32 of the
economic cost if converted from 1980 to 1988 price level. The overall
economic project costs shows a saving of 5.5Z at 1988 constant prices. The
updated financial and economic costs for different types of berths are
summarized as follows:

Economic Benefits
11.      The quantifiable benefits attributed to the three ports project
consist of saving in: ship time in port (includes berth time, waiting time
and lightering time), cargo handling and cargo port time (Table 6.7). The
total estimated savings in 1988 in comparison with the SAR at 1988 constant
prices are summarized as follows:

a Includes foreign general cargo traffic.
All the figures are rounded.
At Huangpu port, the higher traffic only yielded marginal savings in ship port
time due to the downward revision of ship cost in port by 16Z (para. 8,
Annex 3). The higher utilization of general cargo berth facilities associated
with the higher traffic volumes has resulted in less savings in ship port time
than the SAR estimates. At Shanghai port, the reassessment of the number of
existing container berths caused savings in ship port time to be underesti-
mated in the SAR. At Tianjin port, the readjustment made by the Port
Authority in using container berths also for break-bulk cargo in order to cope
with the lower container traffic demand has resulted in less savings in ship
port days as compared with the SAR estimates. Comparing the new estimates of
savings in cargo handling and cargo port time with those of the SAR, most of
the project berths show large increases in savings as a result of the reduc-
tion in cargo handling costs and increases in cargo values. Huangpu port
shows lower savings in cargo port time only because of congestion caused by
coal and general cargo traffic there. The total savings in ship port time and
cargo handlirS costs account for about 90? of the first year benefits (1987).
The total savings in cargo port time account for the remaining benefits.
These patterns are expected to remain constant until the year 2000 if traffic
demand is sustained.
12.      A large part of the project benefits result from ship time savings.
These savings would accrue first to ship owners. During appraisal, all ship
time savings were assumed to accrue to the Chinese. However, now with
increasing non-Chinese ships operating in China, the benefits of the project
which were assumed to have accrued entirely to national flag shipping, needs
to be adjusted, and for the purpose of this PCR we assume 15Z of the benefits
accrue to foreigners (except for the coal traffic), i.e. only 85? accrues to
the national economy.
