3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The overall objective of the project was to assist in improving the quality of science and technical (S&T)
education and research in Korea through implementation of an agreed Policies and Actions Program (PAP)
by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the provision of specialized equipment. Specifically, the project
was to:
(a) support quality improvement in undergraduate science and engineering departments in selected
universities;
(b) assist in strengthening the teaching and research capacity of marine science institutions to address
environmental problems;
(c) assist in improving the quality of practical science and engineering programs in the open
universities (OUs) and in selected junior technical colleges (JTCs);
(d) improve opportunities for junior research activities in basic sciences through strengthening common
research facilities at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), formerly the Korea Basic Science
Center (KBSC); and
(e) enhance the quality of training in selected vocational high schools (VHSs).
3.2 Revised Objective:
The project objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The loan was to finance equipment with a total baseline cost of US$190 million. This equipment was to be
allocated to: (1) MOE - US$170 million; and (2) KBSI - US$20 million. The MOE's share was allocated
as follows: (1) engineering departments - US$60 million; (2) natural science departnents - US$45 million;
(3) marine science departments - US$20 million; (4) OUs - US$15 million; (5) JTCs - US$10 million; and
(6) VHSs - US$20 million.
The Government of Korea (GOK) was to supply complementary inputs of US$134.8 million including
contingencies to ensure all the equipment would be utilized effectively. Of this, US$63.9 million was to
finance local transportation and installation, operations and maintenance (O&M) and consumable materials
for the equipment. The GOK was also to finance physical facilities for KBSI's equipment (US$8.8
million) and all contingencies (US$62.D million).
3.4 Revised Components:
Components were not revised. However, there were some changes in the loan allocations within the
components (from private to public institutions) due to some cancellation during the financial crisis of 1998
- 1999 by the private institutions of the subsidiary loans for equipment made to them by the GOK.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project met overall project objectives.
Approximately 16,800 pieces of equipment were provided to a total of 123 MOE institutions and the KBSI
by the project. Under the MOE, the project facilitated and enhanced research capabilities and teaching
programs, especially in science and technology, at 36 university engineering departments, 41 university
natural science departments, 10 marine science institutions, 9 OUs, 8 JTCs, and 19 VHSs. All equipment
items are actively used for research and teaching at the project institutions (see Tables 1 and 2 of
Borrower's Evaluation Report, MOE). The research outputs have been impressive. Under the MOE, the
number of research projects has more than doubled from 4,105 in 1995 to over 10,000 in 1999. A total of
40,929 research activities were conducted during the implementation period, about 50% over appraisal
estimates. The results of 87% of these activities were published either domestically or internationally, 12%
have been used by related industries, and 2% have been awarded patents. Similarly, KBSI conducted over
40,000 joint research projects with universities, research institutes and industrial companies during the
implementation period, and a total of approximately 600 of them have been published domestically and
internationally.
The project benefited not only the project institutions but also other institutions including several in the
private sectors by making the procured equipment available to them. For example, 9 major national
universities in Korea have allocated 29.4% of their loan allocations to their research and teaching support
institutes which provide common facilities and equipment to users from not only inside but also outside the
project universities. Similarly, equipment provided to the Korea Marine University was utilized by private
organizations and industries for training.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1: MOE
Agreed PAP was monitored and updated regularly. The outputs of the project by component are measured
against the agreed PAP.
Engineering Departments: A total of 4,055 pieces of equipment were provided to 19 public and 17
private universities. The following PAP targets were also achieved: (a) the number of professors was
increased from 6,500 in 1992 to 11,615 in 1999, more than the target of 10,840 which was expected to
result from an annual increase of 620; (b) a reduction in student/faculty ratios from 37 in 1992 to 25 in
1999; and (c) a reduction in teaching load from 12 classes per week in 1992 to 9 classes per week in 1999.
Natural Science Departments: A total of 4,688 pieces of equipment were provided to 20 public and 21
private universities to help upgrade their laboratories. The supply of equipment was complemented by an
increase in the number of professors from 7,900 in 1992 to 11,563 in 1999. This increase in staff also led
the natural science departments to achieve other PAP targets: (a) a reduction in student/faculty ratios from
26 in 1992 to 19 in 1999; and (b) a reduction in teaching loads from 12 classes per week in 1992 to 9
classes per week in 1999. The following joint targets for both engineering and natural science departments
were also met: (c) expansion of library capacity; (d) an increase in the number of visiting professors which
reached 806 in 1998 and exceeded the target of 120 for that year; and (e) an increase in academic research
- 3 -



subsidies from W20 billion in 1992 to WIOO billion in 1999.
Marine Science Departments: The project provided a total of 1,091 pieces of equipment to IO public
marine science departments. The project-funded equipment has helped these institutions to enhance their
research capacity. Under GOK's concept of centralizing expensive equipment to make it efficient to
maintain and operate and to allow its utilization without institutional discrimination, the Marine Simulation
Training and Research Center was built at the Korea Marine University to host the most expensive
project-financed equipment item, a Full Mission Shiphandling Simulator System. This item has been well
utilized not only by the university's staff and students, but also by the private sector for training.
Open Universities: Although the project did not meet the original PAP target for provision of equipment
in 1998, it made significant contributions to quality improvement of the OU's technical programs. The
project provided a total of 1,232 pieces of equipment to 9 OUs and raised the equipment provision rate
from 26% of standard lists for each category of laboratory in 1992 to 73% in 1999.
Junior Technical Colleges: A total of 1,177 pieces of equipment were provided to the 4 public and 4
private JTCs. The project raised the equipment provision rate from 54% of the standard lists in 1992 to
90% in 1998, which was well above the PAP target of 76%. The JTCs also achieved the following PAP
targets: (a) an increase in student enrollments from 159,000 in 1992 to 294,250 in 1999; (b) an increase in
a number of JTC/industry cooperation committees to 60 by 1999; and (c) a reduction in student/faculty
ratios from 29 in 1992 to 18 in 1999.
Vocational High Schools: The project provided a total of 4,240 pieces equipment to 19 VHSs and met the
equipment provision target of 70% in 1999. The number of Joint Practice Centers in the VHS system
increased to 38 in 1999 and well exceeded the PAP target of 30.
Component 2: KBSI
A total of 322 pieces of equipment were provided to the KBSI main campus and 4 regional centers by the
project and were utilized for joint research projects with universities, research institutes and industrial
companies during the project period. There were a total of 44,692 research projects undertaken by 4,191
participating organizations. Three hundred sixty eight of them were published domestically, and 242 were
published internationally.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate ojfreturn:
Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project had a significant impact oni institutional development of the selected institutions which directly
received equipment from the project as well as other universities, research institutions, and industrial
companies with which joint research projects were conducted. The project-funded equipment enabled these
institutions to enhance their research capabilities and teaching programs. These impacts are evidenced in
- 4 -



the increased number of research projects, publications, and patent awards during the project
implementation mentioned in Section 4.1.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. 1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The financial crisis in Korea that began in September 1997 did not cause a shortfall of counterpart funds
due to the GOK's strong commitment to the project. However, there were some changes in the loan
allocations within the components (from private to public institutions) due to the cancellation during the
crisis by the private institutions of the subsidiary loans for equipment made to them by the GOK.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The GOK was highly committed to improving the quality of S&T education and to producing skilled
manpower to support the country's technical advancement in the coming decades. Therefore, the project
received strong support and close collaboration from the govemment throughout its implementation period.
There were no factors subject to GOK control that negatively affected implementation or the outcome of
the project.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The performance of the project implementation agencies was satisfactory throughout the implementation
period (Sections 7.5 and 7.6) and there was no negative impact on implementation or the outcome of the
project that were subject to the implementation agencies' control.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$324.8 million including contingencies of US$62
million. There was no problem with counterpart funds throughout the project. At project closing, the total
project cost was US$322.39 million, and cumulative disbursements were US$189.23 million. Financing
under IBRD was 59% of total and 41% under the GOK. Detailed project costs and financing are shown in
Annex 2.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability of project objectives is highly likely due mainly to: (1) the GOK's continuing strong
commitment to the S&T education sector; (2) already-secured funding for future operation of the project
institutions; (3) the high technical and professional knowledge of the staff working in the sector; and (4) the
continuous revision of policy to meet new demands in the sector.
The GOK remains strongly committed to the expansion and improvement of S&T education and research
to ensure an adequate supply of trained manpower for the rapidly changing information age.
Universities: The GOK launched Brain Korea 21 (BK 21) in 1999 to develop internationally known
Korean research universities mainly in the fields of natural science and engineering. The government is
committed to investing a total of US$1.2 billion over the next seven years for BK 21. In addition, US$70
- 5 -



million will be provided annually to procure highly-technical experimental equipment to advance the
research capacity of the universities.
GOK funds have been provided to build new facilities such as the Marine Simulation Training and
Research Center to house some of the more sophisticated project-financed simulation and research
equipment. The contracts for these pieces of equipment include training by the manufacturers as well as
maintenance contracts. In addition, these items generate income to the Center by providing access and
training to the private sector. Therefore, O&M funds for future operation of the equipment are expected to
be adequate.
Open Universities and Junior Technical Colleges: The GOK will continue to finance experimental
equipment for the OUs and selected JTCs to improve the quality of their practical science and engineering
programs and research (a total of UIS$7 million will be provided to JTCs for procurement of experimental
equipment in 2000).
Vocational High Schools: The GOK will further support expansion of region-based joint practice centers
for the VHSs and has committed an. additional US$5 million to build 2 new centers in 2000. Moreover,
investment for the multimedia laboratories will be provided to a total of 774 VHSs by 2001.
Korea Basic Science Institutioft The GOK opened another KBSI regional branch center in Chonju, the
fifth one, in December 1999 and is committed to further support expansion of research and development
(R&D) at the KBSI and interaction with universities and industrial institutions through collaborative
projects in basic science.

7. Bank and Borrower Perforniance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
The Bank performance in identificalion, preparation, and appraisal was highly satisfactory. The project
was carefully prepared to respond to the government's request for assistance in the S&T education and
research sector. The project was designed within a policy and institutional framework which had been
strengthened under previous Bank projects. During preparation, a number of issues in the sector were
discussed with the Borrower and appropriate actions were identified in the PAP. The project appraisal
document was well prepared and provided clear guidance to the Borrower during implementation.
Efficiency was gained during the preparation stage by combining the preparation of this project with
preparation of both the Environmental Research and Education Project (Loan 3612-KO) and the
Environmental Technology Development Project (Loan 3694-KO).
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision performance was highly satisfactory. The Bank conducted supervision missions every six
months with adequately skilled staff. Continuity of Bank staff throughout project implementation,
combining supervision with the other two projects (Section 7. 1), and efficiently coordinated missions both
by the Bank and the Borrower minimized the total staff weeks spent on supervision to below 30. Mission
supervision reports were complete with updated performance indicator, covenant compliance, and project
- 6 -



status reports (PSRs) which included detailed information on disbursements and procurement.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall Bank performance is rated highly satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance in identification, preparation, and appraisal was highly satisfactory. The
borrower identified the project for potential external financing before requesting Bank assistance. Most of
the preparation work was completed by the Borrower and was compliant with requests for information
formulated by the Bank.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The GOK's implementation performance was highly satisfactory throughout project implementation. The
government had a strong commitment to the project and provided close collaboration with the Bank during
the supervision missions. The borrower was in compliance with Bank requirements for the timely
submission of audit reports, semi-annual progress reports, and status reports. The government's efficient
monitoring and reporting on project implementation facilitated supervision by the Bank missions and
should be given special recognition.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Staff of the implementation agencies (MOE and KBSI) were highly dedicated and knowledgeable in project
management and implementation. The major component of the project, procurement of specialized
equipment, was handled in a highly satisfactory manner by the Supply Administration, Republic of Korea
(SAROK), the government's central procurement agency which has had a long and successful experience in
equipment procurement under past Bank projects. The implementing agencies were excellent in record
keeping and reporting and provided sufficient information to the Bank's supervision missions. However,
there was a change in responsible project staff toward the end of the project, causing some delays in the
preparation of the ICR questionnaires and evaluation summaries due to their unfamiliarity with the project.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Korea originally graduated from borrower status in June 1995. However, due to the financial crisis in
1997, Korea is now under "re-graduation" status. This will probably be the final education loan to the
GOK. Therefore, the key lessons to be learned from this project shall apply to other projects in general.
(1) Project design and capacity of implementation agencies: The project design was simple. The project
had only two major components and these were implemented by two implementation agencies (MOE and
KBSI) which had considerable experience in implementing earlier Bank projects. The simple project design
and the careful assessment of implementation agencies during project design facilitated a smooth and
successful project implementation.
-7-



(2) Capacity of procurement agency: The borrower's procurement agency had sufficient knowledge of
the Bank's procurement procedures and capacity to prepare technical specification which greatly enhanced
the project's implementation.
(3) Diffusion of project equipment: The project made the procured equipment available to outside project
institutions including some universities, private organizations and industries. This resulted in high
equipment utilization rates and generated impressive numbers of researches and publications (Section 4.1),
and supplemental income for future O&M funds of equipment (Section 6.1).

Pusan National University (College of Natural Science and College of Pharmacy), Korea
Maritime University, Pukyong National University, Pusan Metropolitan City Office of
Education, and Kyong Nan Technical High School. The mission would like to take this
opportunity to express its appreciation for the kind hospitality and assistance extended to
the mission during these visits.
3.  The mission received two status reports, one from Ministry of Education (MOE)
and one from Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI)3. The mission also received the
FY98 Audit Report from KBSI. The overall progress was generally satisfactory.
4.   Summary of Procurement and Disbursement. The Loan will be closed on
schedule on December 31, 1999. Procurement and disbursement for KBSI have been
completed with their Loan allocation fully disbursed (US$20.0 million approximately).
The overall progress of procurement and disbursement under the MOE components has
been satisfactory, and expected to reach almost full disbursement. MOE has informed
the mission that there may be about $250,000 unused funds to be cancelled at closing.
Annex 1 provides a summary of the procurement and disbursement data given to the
mission by MOE and KBSI.
5.   Procurement. Total amount of procurement requests sent to SAROK has reached
US$196.6 (103% of the loan amount), of which US$175.4 million was from MOE (103%
of its allocation) and US$21.2 million from KBSI (106% of its allocation). The total
amount of signed contracts was US$186.3 million (98% of the loan amount), of which
US$165.7 million was from MOE (97% of its allocation) and US$20.6 million from
KBSI (103% of its allocation). Some of the requests are in the process of being
contracted, and for an-approximate amount of US$630,000, MOE would like to request
the Bank's approval for procuring four research equipment packages using international
shopping procedures. The mission endorsed such procurement procedures for meeting
' This Aide Memoire is subject to the review and modification by Bank Management.

the relatively short procuremlent lead time in order for the project to be closed on time,
and would recommend to the Bank that approval be given on an exceptional basis, if such
request would forward to the Bank officially.
6.  Disbursement. Total disbursements have improved from US$168.0 million (88%
of total loan amount), of which US$156.3 million was from MOE (93% of its allocation)
and US$20.0 million from KBSI (100% of its allocation). The mission urged MOE to
speed up its disbursement activities in order to fully utilize the Loan proceeds before its
Closing Date. Both KBSI and MOE expressed their desire to request the four-month
grace period in order to process disbursement documents. The mission expressed such
request will be supported by the Bank if needed.
7.  Covenant Compliance. All loan covenants are in full compliance. There is no
outstanding audit report. The final Policies and Actions Program will be submitted to the
Bank by December 31, 1999.
8.  KBSI. The mission visited KBSI in Taejon and found their procurement and
disbursement activities have been nearly completed with the last Application for
Withdrawal #17, totaling about US$653,346.03, to be submitted to the Bank shortly. The
mission discussed with KBS.[ staff the preparation activities for the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) and its purpose, and agreed on the ICR schedule including the
submission of project financial data and project achievements as well as the ICR
questionnaires (a simpler version of Annex 4).
9.  Field Visit Findings. As stated in paragraph 2 above, the mission visited three
universities and two technical high schools in Taejon and Pusan cities. Equipment
financed by the Bank represents only about 2% to 3% of the total equipment in
Chungnam Mechanical and T echnical High School and Kyong Nan Technical High
School (US$462,262 and US$213,422 respectively). Mechanical equipment and
computers are well kept and highly utilized. Graduation rate for both schools is almost
100% and employment rates are about 60% to 70% with the rest of the students entering
universities and technical insltitutions. Both high schools are very well managed with no
shortage of staff and classrooms. About 10% of the 25,000 students in Chungnam
Mechanical and Technical High School stay in school dormitory, which was built in
1978. Computer and English courses are essential part of the school curricula. Girl
enrollment represents about 30% of the total student enrollment in the Kyong Nan
Technical High Schools, where as Chungnam Mechanical and Technical High School is a
boys' technical high school.
10. The actual Loan allocations for Pusan National University, Korea Maritime
University, and Pukyong Natilonal University are US$2,925,890, US$5,418,000 and
US$11,931,602 respectively. Pusan National University has a yearly budget of US$97.8
million, Korea Maritime University US$35.0 million, and Pukyong National University
US$83.0 million. All three universities were participants of previous Bank-financed
education projects, such as 7tt and gth education projects. All universities expressed their
gratitude toward the Bank for helping them to accomplish the science and technical
academic achievements including enhancing their research capability to remain
competitive in the globalization environrnent.

11. New facilities were built to house the additional expensive simulation and research
equipment financed by the Loan such as the Marine Simulation Training and Research
Center of Korea Maritime University, and the Cooperative Laboratory Center of Pukyong
National University. Bank-financed equipment represents about 60% to 70% in these
two centers. These two research centers are very modem buildings, and they are well
maintained and managed. Korean universities usually do not charge user fees for use of
their equipment by the public, however, the Cooperative Laboratory Center has been
charging small amounts of user fees since 7 months ago. So far, they have collected
about 10.0 million Won. They are aiming at 30.0 million Won per year, and no charge
for university students and faculties. Different pieces of equipment are being kept in
three Colleges in Pusan National University - Colleges of Natural Science, Engineering,
and Pharmacy, and their utilization rates are fairly high compared to the new research
centers in Korea Maritime University and Pukyong National University.
12. Equipment for three universities is well kept, and utilization activities are logged
for each piece of equipment. There is no shortage of funds for staff and consumables.
Several full time staff are on the job to assist research activities as well as for
maintenance and inventory controls. Some highly sophisticated pieces of equipment
have included training contracts by manufacturers as well as maintenance contracts. The
most expensive equipment financed by this project and inspected by the Bank is the Full
Mission Shiphandling Simulator System in the Marine Simulation Training and Research
Center of the Korea Maritime University. It costs about US$2.0 million, which has a 270
degree bridge view. The center also offers training courses to private sector as well.
13. MOFE. The mission paid a courtesy visit to MOFE, and thanked them for their
support and cooperation during the implementation of all 11 education projects. The
mission also discussed the mutual understanding of loan allocation distributions among
project components.
14. SAROK. Review of Bid Evaluation Reports and Contract Awards. The mission
visited SAROK in Taejon City, and reviewed a random sample of 68 procurement items
out of 262 items (26% of total contract awards under this review period). The mission
reminded SAROK that no price negotiations are allowed under the ICR procedures, and
the requirement of revising the technical specifications for rebidding as well as its
reasons have to be clearly documented. The Bank's guidelines need to be strictly
followed for the rest of the implementation period.
15. SOE Review. There were 6 applications for withdrawals (AFWs) under MOE and
I AFW under KBSI. The mission reviewed about 12% of the items of MOE's AFWs,
totaling about 25 items; and 100% of the 11 items of KBSI's AFW#16. No discrepancies
were found.
16. ICR Preparation. ICR preparation and its activity schedule were agreed upon
with both KBSI (see paragraph 8) and MOE (see Annex 5). A set of questionnaires was
given to each of the implementation agencies to complete and submit to the Bank
separately (see Annex 4). The purpose of ICR was also discussed (see Annex 2).
3



17. Settlement of the Special Account. Either AFWs or the refund of the balance of
the Special Account should be done in order to settle the Special Account with the
Bank's Disbursement Division. Refund should be sent to the following World Bank
account:
Federal Reserve Bank of New York

18. Other Educational Documents. The mission expressed its appreciation for
receiving several education documents from MOE in the subject areas of: (i) introducing
computers and internet access to classrooms, (ii) teacher's training on new technology,
and (iii) higher education reform.
19.  There will be no future progress review mission for this project. The project is
expected to close on December 31, 1999. The ICR is scheduled to be finalized in June
30, 2000.

< Project Review from the Borrower's perspective >
1. Objectives of the project
The project was the second phase of a large master plan aimed at
improving opportunities for joint research activities in the basic research
through strengthening common research facilities and equipment at KBSI.
2. Benefits from the projects
2.1 KBSI could be committed by the project to support our government's
science and technology polices in serving the needs of university faculty
members and professionals from public and private R & D institutes by
helping to build and operate the unique and state-of-the-art equipment
as well. (Table 1, 2)
2.2 The project would lead to improved research cooperation between
institute, university and industry through more efficient research
equipment and facilities for basic research. (Table 3)
2.3 KBSI helps to prepare the scientific and technical work force of the
future by offering a variety of learning and R & D experiences to
graduate students and faculty members. (Table 4)
2.4 Close relationship between Bank staff and the executing department has
yielded several institutional benefits to KBSI.
3. Bank's performance
3.1 Bank personnel were recognized as professional in all respects. Not only
mission members were always highly qualified in their respective fields
but also staff appraisal report was appropriate to address the kinds of
implementation problems occurring.
3.2 The constructive dialogue and Bank's supervision effort was quite
beneficial.



4. Lessons learned
4.1 The overall communications between the Bank and the Borrower,
including accounting of commitments and draw-down of loan proceeds,
should be sufficiently well documented and thoroughly understood so
that when the changes in government or mission personnel occur, such
changes will deeply affect project implementation.
4.2 The performance of the participating institutions in overall project
planning should be reviewed to compare with the results.
4.3 A specialist and manual should be made available to make a thorough
review of equipment specifications before going out to tender. Moreover,
clearly stated responsibilities about warranty should be pointed out in
equipment specifications.
4.4 Bidding and reimbursing procedures should be fully recognized not to
take much time in preparing and getting documents.
5. Project sustainability
5.1 The sustainability of economic benefit is to provide reliable utility
support and the additional necessary infrastructure required to produce
the appropriate environment for conducting outstanding research.
5.2 In terms of technology progress, new scientific research fields came into
being as a result of newly acquired equipment and we were able to
commit education programs on state-of-the-art equipment.
5.3 The users are strongly recommended to carry out research in the basic
sciences to ensure a national competence and knowledge in research and
development field.
6. Conclusion
6.1 During the past year, significant effort was expended on a working
administrative framework for each of the equipment, and KBSI has
continued its outreach programs, ranging from the dissemination of
informnation about facili[ties to the development of extensive contacts



through the headquarters and nation-wide branches. Therefore,
remarkable progress was made in relatively short periods.
6.2 Plans for the future involve the expansion of such efforts and the
assumption of additional responsibility in facilitating scientific education
programs.
6.3 This year will see completion of many of the activities developed during
the project period.
6.4 R & D interactions between university and industry should be greatly
increased by more exchange of knowledge, personnel and collaborative
projects.
6.5 We shall continue to develop our basic understanding of the structure of
our activities so that we can define meaningful measures of progress.
6.6 We believe that our enriched research equipment, when fully set up, will
make constructive changes to revitalize the university and industry
research so that our wealth of talent and facilities will contribute more
effectively to our research capacities and economic growth.

About KOREA BASIC SCIENCE INSTITUTE
In order for Korea to recover from the current economic crisis and to
become an advanced nation, it is essential that we transform from the
technology import mode to the creative R&D mode. The real econonnic
development takes place only when it is strongly based on science and
technology. Basic science is the basis of creative and innovative
technological advances and also the source that breathes vitality into
applied or exploratory research.
Korea Basic Science Institute(KBSI) was launched in August, 1988 as
the first National Users' Facility to help carry out effective basic science
research in Korea. By maintaining the most advanced, state-of-the-art
equipment and research facilities that are typically too expensive for
individual institutes to acquire, joint use of facilities and cooperative
research are being condcucted at Taedok headquarters and at four regional
branches. KBSI is also leading the national fusion R&D programn, which is
to design and construct a superconducting tokamak device, called
KSTAR(Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research). It
eventually will become a world-class national users' facility.
Following the original charter mission of KBSI, we will do our best
to keep it as the central institute to promote basic science, to expand its
specialized areas of sc:ientific support, and to secure the user-oriented
support capabilities.
We like to make sure that the users have an easy access to the
equipment and facilities by establishing an user-friendly open-door
operation. Through such effort, we believe KBSI can become a
world-class basic science joint research institute.
Facing upon the era of science and technology of the 21st century,
we promise to do our best to provide high-level research support, based
on our ten-year experience and accumulated knowledge. And we sincerely
hope that all members of the science & technology communities and
related organizations around the world continue to support our mission.

Borrower's Evaluation Report
for
the IBRD Science and Technical Education Project (LN 3693-KO)
1. Project Rationale and Objectives
1.1    For more than two decades, the World Bank has supported the development of S&T
education and research in Korea. Emphasis has been placed on expanding the supply of technical
manpower at all levels and also on qualitative improvements. In the 1980s, attention was given to
the policy framework within which S&T education and research operated and policy improvements
were introduced under two sector loans (Ln. 1800-KO, and Ln. 2427-KO). This has permitted recent
science and technical (S&T) education and research projects to be designed within a policy
framework that was generally sound. The next decade will be a period of accelerating technological
change and Korea's S&T education system will be challenged to respond by ensuring that it
continues to produce, in quantity and quality, the necessary skilled manpower to support the
country's technological advancement. The project represents the final opportunity for the Bank to
assist Korea in identifying policy improvements and specifying the targets which will improve S&T
education in future years. As Korea's graduation project in education, it brings to a close the long
and successful association between Korea and the Bank in the education sector..
1.2    The overall objective of the project was to assist in improving the quality of S&T education
and research through implementation of the Policies and Actions Program and the provision of
specialized equipment. Specifically, the project would: (a) support quality improvement in
undergraduate science and engineering departments in selected universities; (b) assist in
strengthening the teaching and research capacity of marine science institutions to address
environmental problems; (c) assist in improving the quality of practical science and engineering
programs in open universities and in selected junior technical colleges; (d) improve opportunities for
joint research activities in basic science through strengthening common research facilities at the
Korea Basic Science Institute; and (e) enhance the quality of training in selected VHSs. Quality
improvement is being supported through the provision of up-to-date laboratory and workshop
equipment. Provision of such equipment under the project is expected to enhance the performance
of faculty in a wide range of institutions.
2. Origin and Description of the Project
2.1    The Government of Korea (GOK) included the project in its FY93 list of projects suitable
for external financing and formally asked the Bank for assistance in November 1992. Most of the
preparation work was completed by GOK in accordance with requests for information formulated by
the Bank. The project was preappraised in March 1993 and appraised in July 1993.
Appropriateness of the loan proposal was recognized and the loan agreement was signed on
February 16, 1995 for the loan of US$190,000,000 or less after negotiation on the agreement
1



conditions in Washington, D.C. GOK sent to the Bank all documents required for the loan such as
legal comments on the agreement, etc. The loan agreement was notified by the Bank to be effective
as of May 11, 1994.
2.2    The project was designed to finance for equipment procurement and to be completed by
December 31, 1999. The categories of items to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan and the
allocation of the amounts of the loan to each category were as follows:
(a) University Engineering Departrnents             US$ 60,000,000
(b) University Natural Science Departments          US$ 45,000,000
(c) Marine Science Departments                      US$ 20,000,000
(d) Open Universities                               US$ 15,000,000
(e) Junior Technical Colleges                       US$ 10,000,000
(f) Vocational High Schools                         US$ 20,000,000
(g) Korean Basic Science Institute                  USS 20,000,000
3. Implementation of the Project
A. Selection of Participating Institutions
3.1    According to the criteria specified in the Loan Agreement, MOE has selected 23 public
universities, 26 private universities, 9 open universities, 4 public technical colleges, 4 private
technical colleges, and 19 vocational high schools. The Korean Basic Science Institute (KBSI) that
is under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) was included in the project from the
designing stage of the project. KBSI was to achieve value added in the form of fostering efficient
mechanism for centralizing common research activities, which would be of particular benefit to
smaller institutions.
B. Equipment Procurement
3.2    General Procedures of Equipment Procurement. Most of equipment procurement was
undertaken by the Supply Administration, Republic of Korea (SAROK), which is highly experienced
in procuring equipment under the Bank's international competitive bidding procedures. On the basis
of equipment lists and specifications submitted by project institutions, SAROK has prepared
intemational competitive bidding documents, invited bids, evaluated them in collaboration with the
institutions, and made contract awards with selected suppliers. In the case of equipment
procurement for vocational high schools, 16 district offices of education prepared equipment lists
based on the requests from vocational high schools within their districts and submitted them to
SAROK. Toward the closing date of the project, equipment of US$627,000 equivalent was procured
through the intemational shopping procedure under the permission by the Bank. The supplier was
responsible for installation, initial testing and operation of the equipment as specified in the contract.
It has usually taken 3-8 months between the procurement request to SAROK and the equipment
installation. Most of equipment was under 1 or 2 year warranty.
2



3.3    Equipment Procurement. Although the final allocations of loan to categories of the project
were not changed from the original one, there were some changes within categories. Because the
currency exchange rate for Korean Won to US$ became almost doubled after the unexpected crisis
of national economy in 1998-1999, private institutions cancelled some of their loan allocations which
had not been disbursed yet. MOE has transferred the loan cancelled by private institutions to public
institutions in 1999 under the permission by the Bank and relevant authorities of GOK (Table 1).
3.4    A total of 16,483 pieces of equipment were procured under the project and
US$169,373,072.86 As of April 20, 2000, the disbursement rate of the project was 99.63%. The
cancellation occurred mainly from university engineering departments and junior technical colleges
(Table 2). Procurement activities were slow in the first year of the project. However, disbursement
rate increased rapidly in the following years and exceeded the appraisal estimated (Table 3).
4. Evaluation of the Project Implementation
4.1    Overall implementation was satisfactory although US$626,927.14, 0.37 % of the loan, is to
be cancelled. Disbursements conformed to all Bank procedures. The allocation of the loan among
disbursement categories was similar to the original estimates. Some changes in the loan allocation
among disbursement categories were mainly due to the cancellation by private institutions during
the unexpected crisis of national economy in 1998-1999. The objectives of the project were
satisfactorily accomplished. One hundred and twenty three institutions were significantly benefited
by the project. The project helped to increase sustainability of the previous assistance in Korea's
S&T education by the Bank.
4.2    The project has facilitated and enhanced research capabilities and teaching programs,
especially in science and technology at 36 engineering colleges, 41 natural science colleges, 10
marine science colleges, 9 open universities, 8 junior technical colleges, and 19 vocational high
schools. Approximately 16,483 pieces of equipment were provided under the project. All equipment
are actively used for research and teaching at the project institutions (Table 5). The research
outputs have been impressive. The number of research projects has been more than doubled from
3,197 in 1995 to 6,471 in 1999. A total of 40,929 research activities were conducted during this
period, about 50% over appraisal estimates. The results of 87% of these activities were published
either domestically or internationally, 12% have been used by related industries, and 2% have been
awarded patents (Table 6).
4.3    The project has benefited not only the selected institutions but also other institutions by
making the procured equipment available to staff and students in other institutions. For example, 9
major national universities in Korea have allocated 29.3% of their loan allocations to the research
and teaching support institutes which provide common facilities and equipment to users from not
only inside but also outside of the universities (Table 7). These institutes were established in late
1980s or early 1990s under the concept of centralizing expensive equipment to efficiently maintain
3



and operate for any users without institutional discrimination. Most of their equipment were relatively
expensive, often over US$100,000 per piece, and procured by extemal finances such as the
previous IBRD loan projects (ILn. 3203-KO and Ln. 3612-KO). Sustainability of these institutes has
been improved greatly by the project.
5. Sustainability of the Educational Equipment Provision
The Government will invest $650 million in the national universities for the next five years (2000 -
2004) including open universities. The fund will help the universities increase the effectiveness of
the educational equipment that have been supplied through the external loan projects and national
funding. It is also necessary to sustain additional provision of the fund to well maintain the
machines. The Government has already provided $500 million for the national universities, junior
technical colleges, open universities.  Table 8 indicates planned annual investment of the
Government from 2000 to 2004(Table 8).
6. Conclusion
6.1  Although 0.37% of the loan is to be cancelled, overall implementation of the project was
successful. Performance of the project institutions, MOE, and SAROK was satisfactory during the
project years. The project will make substantial contribution to S&T education and research in
vocational high schools, technical colleges, and universities in Korea in future years.
6.2  Efficient and effective guidiance by the Bank during the project years, especially approving the
international shopping procedures at the last stage of implementation was greatly appreciated by
MOE and the National InstrLimentation Center for Environmental Management (NICEM), the
beneficiary of the approval.
