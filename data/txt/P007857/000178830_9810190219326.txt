make the prospects for the Paraguayan Gconomr favorable. E:ctensive
areas of unused lands suitable for agropastoral and forestry production
provide opportunities for large scale colonization and expanded
production; improved agriculture could significantly add income to
those lands already in production; additional transportation betterment
work would enhance the competitive price position of mary crops in
world markets; and the further development of agricultural processing
industries could add value to Paraguay's export products.
5.       The most recent economic mission found that Paraguay had
continued its record of consistent, if modest, economic growth in 1971
and that balance of payments performance had also further improved. A
moderate increase in exports, together with a rising inflow of private
and public capital from abroad, made possible a modest increase in net
foreign exchange reserves for the third successive year. Last year's
4.5 percent increase in GDP was particularly satisfactory in the light
of the adverse impact of the weather on certain important crops and
gave additionalcredibility to the Government's five-year plan objective
of raising the average growth rate to aix percent in 1971-75, compared
with the 4.4 percent rate achieved in the 1960a. Developments so far
in 1972 indicate that a six percent growth rate is, in fact, likely
to be achieved this year, together with a further improvement of the
balance of payments position. The outlook for this yearts crops is
good. Livestock production during the first half substantially exceeded
the 1971 level. Public investment is anticipated to incresse during
the year, primarily as a result of an increase in disbursements on
on-going projects by external lenders and an expected rise in the
savings of decentralized public agencies, and an expansion of indus-
trial output. and construction activity ia expected to follow. Largely
as a result of the higher volume of beef exports as well as higher
world beef prices, the first half of 1972 witnessed a remarkable jump.
in exports of 37.5 percent over the similar period in 1971. The first
half trade picture was further brightened by an 11.2 percent drop in
import payments from the comparable period a year ago. As a result,
Paraguay had a favorable trade balance of US$8.2 million for the first
half of 1972 compared to last year's trade deficit of US$13.2 million.
Indications are that Paraguay should achieve significant reserve gains
for the year as a whole.
6.       The economic mission found that the principal weakness in the
1971 economic situation lay on the fiscal side, where performance
deteriorated sharply after many years of improvement. Despite the
expansion of the econonw and foreign trade, Central Government revenues
did not increase at all last year, reflecting a serious weaknening of
tax administration, and there was a significant overrun in current



expenditures. As a result, budgetary savings dropped to 1.2 percent
of GDP, the lowest level in many years. The Government has moved to
deal with the situation by making key personnel changes in the tax
and customs administration and, early this year, a series of new
revenue measures were announced. At the CIAP Country Review in
January, the Government agreed to the establishment of targets for
fiscal improvement in 1972 and 1973 under which Central Government
savings would be restored this year to two percent of GDP, a level
close to the previous peak and sufficient to meet the budgetary
costs of this year's planned rise in public investment.
7.       We indicated to the Government the importance which the
achievement of the agreed fiscal targets would have for the carrying
out of the Bank/IDA lending program, especially since both this
education project and the proposed highway project require substan-
tial budgetary contributions. The record of fiscal performance so
far this year has shown improvement over last year. Although this
improvement may fall short of the CIAP targets for 1972, we are
satisfied that the pattern of improvement, which shows increasingly
significant fiscal gains in the third quarter of 1972, and the
administrative measures taken by the authorities to improve tax
collection and better control expenditures, indicate that the Govern-
ment will be able to support its investment program. It thus appears justi-
fied to proceed with the proposed loan. However, since continued fiscal
improvement will be essential to the carrying out of the education
program of which this project is a part, it was agreed during negotia-
tions that disbursements for construction and the purchase of equipment,
which are planned to get underway in 1974 and which are to absorb
75 percent of the proposed credit,will not begin unless the Association
is satisfied that fiscal performance has been consistent with the CIAP
targets. We are also planning not to proceed with the proposed highway
project until we have had an opportunity to assess full 1972 fiscal
results and the CIAP fiscal projections for 1973.
8.       Even with the improvements which are taking place in export
performance and the public savings effort, Paraguay will continue to
need a substantial inflow of foreign assistance if it is to achieve
its growth and employment objectives. The attainment of the six percent
growth path implies a rapid rise in imports and a widening of the
current account deficit, with the result that it is estimated that
a gross public inflow of about US$250 million will be required during
1972-77 in order to maintain balance of payments equilibrium and permit
some strengthening of Paraguay's slender foreign exchange reserves.
About half of the required capital inflow is already available from
existing loans in the pipeline, mainly from the large balances to be
disbursed on loans from IDB, which has made heavy commitments to



-14-
Paraguay in recent years. With respect to new commitments required
from external lenders, there is little reason to doubt that the
necessary assistance will be available from the international and
bilateral agencies if development performance remains satisfactory,
or that Paraguay can absorb this inflow without incurring an excessive
debt service burden and impairing its creditworthiness. Because the
bulk of Paraguayan borrowing in the past has been from public agencies,
on favorable terms, the debt service ratio stood at only 13.3 percent
in 1971 and our projections indicate that this ratio may decline to
10.8 percent by 1977. In the longer term, however, after the expiration
of the grace period in many of the loans negotiated with the interna-
tional financing agencies, the debt service ratio is expected to grow
and may reach 17 percent by 1985. This outlook underscores Paraguayls
need to guard its debt service capacity with care and the importance
it must attach to borrowing on at least as favorable terms as it
has enjoyed in the past.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
9.       Paraguay has received US$43.23 million (net of cancellations)
in Bank loans and IDA credits.  Cf his amount, US$21.84 million has been
in the form of six IBRD loans, while four credits totalling US$21.39
million have been from IDA resources. The last loan to Paraguay, for
a Second Road Maintenance Project, was approved on January 6, 1970 and
the last credit, for a Third Livestock Project, was approved on June 18,
1969. Annex I contains a Summary Statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as of October 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
10.      The Bank Group lending program in Paraguay has been devoted to
the two sectors most vital to its economic development - agriculture
(including livestock) and transportation, which have received 56 and
44 percent respectively of total Bank Group assistance. Livestock has
received US$20.3 million in loans and credits which have provided the
necessary investment capital to expand production and protect herds
against drought and disease. The US$23 million balance of loans and
credits devoted to transportation has been aimed at reducing Paraguay's
high transportation costs. In the sense that the transportation
projects have facilitated expanded agricultural production for world
markets, our lending in the agricultural and transport sectors has been
complementary.
11.      During the decade of the 1960s the Paraguayan development
strategy placed principal emphasis on public sector investment in
transport, hydroelectric power, telecommunications, water and sewage(,
public health and public housing facilities. The Government's development
strategy in its five-year development plan for the first half of the



1970s has shifted from the former emphasis on economic infrastructure
to providing resources directly to the commodity producing and social
sectors. Priority is being given to agriculture, livestock, forestry,
tourism and education.  The Bank Group current five-year plan is
designed to respond to the Paraguayan development strategy in several
different ways. As a first priority, Bank Group financing is placing
major emphasis on helping the.Government overcome a major obstacle
not untypical of a country at Paraguay's stage of development --
the lack of an adequate institutional base for the fulfillment of
development objectives. Several proposed loans for agriculture will
aim at establishing and strengthening institutions dealing with the
special technical, financial, administrative and infrastructure
problems associated with small-scale agriculture. The proposed lending
for secondary education and highway maintenance will deal with similar
problems in other important sectors. Secondly, the Bank is emphasizing,
in the selection of projects for financing, the identification of projects
which will promote the growth of export-oriented activities and thus
help overcome the balance of payments constraint on development. The
proposed lending for livestock, forestry, and tourism would be in
direct support of this objective, while highway lending would have as a
major focus the reduction of Paraguay's high transportation costs. The
third major thrust of the Bank Group plan, exemplified by the proposed
lending for secondary education and for small-scale agriculture in
some of the less-developed areas of the country, is to help increase
employment and reduce regional and other income disparities.
As far as lending terms are concerned, in view of Paraguay's low per
capita income, generally satisfactory performance and need for external
financing on generous terms to avoid debt problems, we are continuing
to treat Paraguay -as a blend country, receiving approximately equal
portions of IBRD and IDA financing.
12.      A project under consideration by the Bank Group which is in the most
advanced stage of preparation and which we hope to be able to present
during the current fiscal year is a highway project, requiring financing
of US$5.6 million. The project consists of the paving of 76 kilometers
in a rich agricultural area.
13.      Thus far, IFC has made no loans or investments in Paraguay.
It is currently studying an integrated forestry development and wood
processing project which could have a significant impact on foreign
exchange earnings and take advantage of Paraguay's avple forest resources.



PART III - THE BEGININNIS OF EDUCATIONAL REFaRM
14.      The education and training system of Paraguay is handicapped
by structural imbalances and qualitative deficiencies which have
resulted, in significant part, from a history of underspending on
education. In November 1968, shortly after his appointment to office,
the present Minister of Education appointed a technical team to evaluate
Paraguayan education and prepare a plan for educational development.
The report of this team, completed in 1969, proposes a plan for the
decade of the 1970s to overcome the quantitative and qualitative
deficiencies of the educational system. As a result of this plan, a
USAID loan has been made for primary education and educational reforms
have begun. A major outgrowth of the plan is the decision to proceed
with the secondary education project now before you.
15.      Public spending on education amounted to less than US$6 per
capita in 1970, as compared with a range of US$8 to US$26 per capita
in other Latin American countries.  Of.total public investment in
1964/69, education claimed only 1.5 percent.  In 1970, capital outlays
represented 2.2 percent of the Ministry of Education's total expen-
ditures.  No capital investment has been made in public secondwry
schools in the last 16 years, although enrollments have tripled. As
a result, most secondary pupils are accommodated in makeshift facilities
that are inadequate and uneconomical. Although the budget of the
Ministry of Education has risen 9.6 percent from 1962 to 1970, the rise
has not kept pace with other Government expenditures, so that the
percentage share of the Ministry of Education in the total Government
budget dropped from 15.6 percent in 1962 to 12.7 percent in 1970.
Including education expenditures of other Government agencies, 14
percent of the budget was spent on education in 1970. During credit
negotiations, the Government recognized the need for increasing the
Ministry of Education budget by 133 percent during the decade of the
1970s and agreed to consult with IDA over the attainment of this goal
in the years to come. It is estimated that future Government action will
raise the percentage of the national budget for education from the
aforementioned 14 percent in 1970 to 18 percent at the end of the decade.
As part of the proposed project, the Government has agreed to expand the
total budget allocated to secondary and vocational education to reach
more than 20 percent of the budget of the Ministry of Education by 1980
as compared with 15 percent in 1970.
16.      The return on the limited amount of Government spending on
education is impaired by inefficient use of available funds due to far
too low pupil/teacher ratios, uneconomic distribution and use of facili-
ties and small school size, particularly in the interior. An integral
part of the proposed project will be the consolidation of secondary
schools into more efficient units. Provisions for books, teaching



materials, school maintenance and equipment are inadequate and the
existing community donations are not sufficient to satisfy normal
requirements. Budgetary commitments made by the Government in
connection with the proposed credit are especially addressed to
the problems of redressing these inadequacies.
17.      Teachers' salaries are too low, even in relation to those
of other public servants of comparable rank and qualifications.
Teachers are therefore-compelled to teach two and even three shifts
and to divide their professional attention between several schools.
The resulting practices of part-time casual employment and of low
hourly pay have been major obstacles to the development of a
professional cadre of secondary school teachers. Agreements were
reached during negotiations providing for the establishment of
adequate salary scales, the appointment of full-time teachers, the
training of teachers in technical fields, and the adequate staffing
of schools.
18.      Secondary school enrollment in 1970 was 56,000 or 17.2
percent of the age group. The system has a three-year lower cycle
(grades 7-9), followed by a three-year upper cycle (grades 10-12).
The upper cycle offers courses in humanities and sciences, in commerce
and in primary school teaching. Curricula are highly academic and
the scope for effective technical or vocational training is very
limited.   Private secondary education, which accounts for about 52
percent of the total enrollments, is generally considered to have
higher educational standards than the public schools, but as is the
case with the public schools, equipment, teaching materials and teaching
methods are often inadequate.
19.      At present, 60 percent of the students in the upper cycle are
taking courses in humanities and sciences, since graduation from this
program carries higher prestige and the opportunity of entry into the
universities. The remaining 40 percent of the students are evenly
divided between the commercial education and primary-teacher training
programs. In 1970, 54 percent of the 2,500 graduates continued their
studies in the universities while the remainder entered the job market
without the technical and vocational skills needed to find remunerative
employment.
20.      Technical education is limited to one evening course in one
school, located in the capital, at the upper secondary level. The edu-
cation provided by this school is severely limited by not having
laboratories, workshops or adequately trained teachers. The situation
with vocational education is not much better, with vocational courses
offered by only one school in the capital and a number of small private



- 8 -
schools scattered about the country. The Ministry of Agriculture
operates five regional agricultural education centers at the lower
secondary level. There is also one private agricultural school
at the upper secondary level.  Programs in agricultural education
are receiving financial assistance from the IDB and bilateral
sources.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
21.      The identification and preparation of a secondary education
project suitable for Bank Group financing was the result of a joint
effort by the Government, UNESCO and Bank Group staff extending over
several years. In March 1971, a UNESCO Mission assisted the Government
in completing the preparation of the project and an appraisal mission
-visited Paraguay in July and August 1971. Agreement with the Government
on a satisfactory cost sharing formula cleared the way for negotiations,
which were held in July 1972. The Government's negotiating team was
led by the Minister of Education, Dr. Raul Pena. A credit and project
summary is attached as Annex III to this report and an appraisal report,
PE-43, dated November 3, 1972, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Director's.
22.      The proposed project is a key component of Paraguay's overall
educational reform program and would assist the Government in developing
a system of secondary and vocational education that will be more
responsive to the nation's manpower needs. The project includes the
construction and equipment of eight multilateral coeducational secondary
schools, a new technical school and a vocational training center. It
also includes related technical assistance and training.
23.      The construction of the multilateral secondary schools would
help to introduce a more modern, broader concept of secondary education
as well as to redress imbalances in the provision of education across
the country, and to make it possible to provide secondary education on
a larger, more economical scale. Four multilateral schools are to be
located in the Asuncion area where approximately one sixth of the
country's inhabitants reside. The schools will emphasize industrial
arts and home economics in the lower cycle and offer new programs in
humanities, science, commerce, general mechanics and electricity in the
upper cycle. In addition; the workshops in each school will be used
for short-term evening training courses in specific trades for adults
and school dropouts. Four of the multilateral schools are to be located
outside the capital to serve the needs of rural areas and will emphasize
agriculture in the lower cycle. By the time of their completion in
1977, the proposed multilateral schools will provide about 10,000
student places, or 25 percent of the projected secondary school enroll-
ment. The net expansion of student places under the project, however,
would only be about 3,000,since a number of inadequate existing schools
will be closed. Provision has been made under the project for special



-9_
training for the teachers to be employed in project schools and the
Government has given assurances that all the teaching staff will be
employed on a full-time basis and will be paid a sufficient salary
to enable them to devote their full-time to project institutions.
24.      Both the technical school and vocational training centers
are to be located in Asuncion where the largest demand for manpower
in manufacturing and construction exists. The technical school will
have places for 840 students in a three-year upper-secondary course
offering specialized programs in mechanics, electricity, civil
construction and chemistry. The vocational school plans to train
about 1,000 youths and adults annually in various trades. The training
program will be organized in 11-week modules, complete in themselves,
but with each module pzoviding training at a more advanced skill level.
A joint industry/government committee will be established to advise
on industrial training needs, the direction and content of courses and
the placement of graduates.
25.      The project includes 33 man-years of technical assistance and
23 man-years of fellowships for local staff in support of curriculum
development, teaching of technical subjects and project implementation.
Interest in financing some of the foregoing services and fellowships
has been expressed by other international financing sources, and if
such financing materializes, it may permit a subsequent reduction of
the credit or reallocation of the funds concerned.
26..     The cost of the project is estimated at US$7.35 million.
Construction costs represent 40.1 percent of total costs; furniture
and equipment represent 25.4 percent; technical assistance 13.3 percent;
and physical and price contingencies 21.2 percent. The proposed US$5.1
million credit would finance 70 percent of the estinpated total project
costs; of this amount, US$4.2 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component, while US$0.9 million (18 percent of the
credit) would finance local costs, including the estimated amount of
furniture bids that are likely to be won by local manufacturers
(US$170,000). In spite of Paraguay's efforts to mobilize domestic
resources in support of its development program, it still requires
external assistance in excess of the foreign exchange component of
development projects suitable for external financing. For this reason
and because of the priority nature of the proposed secondary education
program, we believe that IDA financing of a portion of the local costs
of this project is justified.



- 10 -
27.      The credit would cover 100 percent of the cost of furniture
and equipment; 100 percent of the foreign exchange expense for tech-
nical assistance and equipment for the project unit; 54 percent of
expenditures for construction; and 45 percent of expenditures for
professional architectural services. All contracts for the supply
of furniture and equipment and for construction work will be subject
to international competitive bidding. All items will be grouped to
the extent practicable to encourage competition. The construction
industry in Paraguay seems capable of meeting the needs of the project
and it is, therefore, unlikely that the project would attract many
foreign bidders, except for equipment for most of which there is no
domestic competition. Contracting for services will be done in
accordance with the Association's usual practices. At the request
of the Government, domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment
would benefit from a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or
the prevailing rate of duty, whichever is lower.
28.      Responsibility for implementation of the proposed project
would be vested in a specially established project unit in the
Ministry of Education. This unit will be under the direction of a
full-time Project Director responsible to the Minister of Education.
The Project Unit will have a staff of full-time employees including
an Educator, Architect, Procurement Specialist and necessary supporting
personnel. The Project Unit will be assisted by an internationally
recruited architect and a procurement specialist.
PART V - LEaAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHQRITY
29.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Paraguay and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement,
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
30.      The draft Development Credit Agreement contains covenants
normally included in agreements for education projects. Attention is
drawn to the following special provisions: (a) Section 2.02(a)(ii)
which conditions disbursements for construction and purchase of equipment
on the attainment of fiscal targets; (b) Schedule 5, which describes



the fiscal targets to be achieved; (c) and Section 4.03 which describes
policies to be pursued by the Government to obtain qualitative and
quantitative improvements in secondary education.
31.      I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of.the Association.
PART VI - RECONMENDATION
I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AND NOTES ON COMPLETED PROJECTS
Loan 396     First Road Project, US$6.0 million and US$2.2'million,
Credit 12.   October 1961 and December 1964-
Work financed by the Bank Group for improving a road between
Asuncion and Encarnacion was completed satisfactorily in
March 1S70. The German Contractor Hochtief claims that it is
entitled to US$11.1 million more than the US$9.6 million it
has received for its work under the contract. For some time
Hochtief tried to resolve its claim through direct negotiations
with the Paraguayan Government. In June 1972, Hochtief altered
its approach and attempted to settle its claim by invoking the
arbitration clause of the contract. The Government, however,
has not yet appointed its representative on the arbitration
panel as called for in the arbitration clause, and Hochtief
has asked for Bank assistance in bringing the Paraguayans to
arbitration. We have advised the Government of the Bank's
interest in having the parties to Bank-financed contracts
adhere to the disputes provisions of such contracts and have
advised Hochtief that, under the circumstances, its most
appropriate course of action would be to pursue and exhaust
the judicial remedies which are still open to it under Paraguayan
law for establishing the arbitral tribunal.
Loan 443     Second Road Project, US$2.1 million, April 1966
The road improvement and paving financed by the loan have been
successfully completed. Full payment, however, has not yet
been made for final engineering work for roads in southwestern
Paraguay contained in the project. The Government has not
made such payment because it alleges that it has not yet
received some of the work called for by its contract with the
consulting engineer, and, with respect to other work, it claims
that it is not satisfied with its quality. The consulting
engineer and the Government have been holding discussions on
these matters with a view toward resolving their differences,
and we are following the progress of the discussions.
Loan 620     Third Livestock Project, US$4.3 million, IDA and US$4.3 million, IERD,
Credit 156   June 25, 1969
The third livestock project initially suffered some delays
because of less than expected demand for credit from ranchers.

The circumstances responsible for reduced demand - drought
conditions, low beef prices and insufficient accompanying
working capital credit no longer exist and project implementation
is now proceeding at a satisfactory pace. The repayment record
for subloans by ranchers under this and preceding loans in
the livestock project has been excellent with 96 percent of
all interest and amortization payments due having been made.
Loan 652     Second Road Maintenance Project, US$6.0 million,
January 9, 1970
During 1971 and 1972 some US$2.8 million of highway maintenance
equipment was purchased with loan financing. An additional
US$2.1 has been scheduled to be purchased during 1973 and 1974;
however, failure of the Ministry of Public Works to keep budgetary
funds available for maintenance at the level that had been
agreed with the Bank has caused us to advise the Borrower that,
unless appropriate corrective action is taken, we could not
agree to the financing of additional bulk purchases of equipment.
We are presently awaiting the Government's response.

PARAGUAY: EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUITARY
Borrower:      Republic of Paraguay
Amount:        US$5.1 million equivalent in various currencies
Terms:         Standard
Project Description:  The project consists of constructing and equipping
eight multilateral co-educational secondary schools,
a new upper secondary level technical school and a
vocational training center.  The schools would be
located in various parts of the country and would
consolidate existing small and inefficient schools.
The curriculum of the multilateral schools would
introduce technical and scientific subjects. The
project would also include 33 man-years of technical
assistance and 23 man-years of fellowships for local
staff in support of curriculum development, teaching
of technical subjects and project implementation.
The project also seeks to bring about greater
governinent financial support for the education sector,
in particular secondary and secondary technical
education, as well as the assignment of full-time
adequately compensated and trained teachers to all
secondary schools. An important aspect of the project
will be cooperation with industry to insure the provision
of adequately trained personnel to meet industrial
manpower needs.

Procurement:  All contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment and
for construction work will be subject to international
competitive bidding. All items will be grouped to the
extent practicable to encourage competition. The construction
industry in Paraguay seems capable of meeting the needs of
the project and it is unlikely that the project would attract
many foreign bidders, except for equipment for most of which
there is no local competition. Contracting for services
will be done in accordance with the Associationts usual
practices. At the request of the Government, domestic manu-
facturers of furniture and equipment would benefit from a
preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or the prevailing
rate of duty, whichever is lower.
