APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN PARAGUAY
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises an education project in Paraguay, aimed at
improving and expanding the education system, for which an IDA Credit for
US$5.1 million is proposed. The education and training system of Paraguay
is handicapped by structural imbalances and qualitative deficiencies which
resulted from a history of under-spending on educational development. The
proposed project would provide for the establishment of a number of educa-
tional institutions which would meet urgent manpower needs and introduce
better curricula and teaching methods. The project would also provide tech-
nical assistance to improve education administration and teaching.
ii.       The proposed project, which would be the first education project
to be financed by the Bank Group in Paraguay, would concentrate on secondary
and technical education and vocational training, as the needs in other fields
are being met by other aid agencies. Programs aimed at improving primary
education receive technical and financial support from USAID. Teacher train-
ing programs for primary and secondary schools are supported by UNDP/Unesco
and USAID. Agricultural education at secondary level is being supported
through an IDB loan and a grant from the Federal Republic of Germany. A
UNDP/SF project will help to upgrade the training of science teachers for
secondary schools. Finally, IDB is considering a request to finance improve-
ments in higher education.
iii.      The main shortcomings in secondary education are an excess of aca-
demic as compared with technical education (resulting in a shortage of tech-
nically trained manpower) and poor quality of teaching resulting from in-
adequate curricula, part-time teachers, very low staff salaries and lack of
educational facilities. The lack of technically-trained manpower is limit-
ing the growth of industrial and agricultural production. The IDA project
would help to overcome these shortcomings by supporting the establishment
of a new type of secondary school with a more diversified program and by
strengthening technical education and vocational training.
iv.       The proposed project would consist of eight multilateral co-educa-
tional secondary schools, a new upper-secondary level technical school and a
vocational training center. Four of the multilateral schools would be lo-
cated in the capital, Asuncion, and the other four in the interior. They
would help to redress imbalances in the provision of education across the
country. They would also introduce a more economical scale of school units
and a new concept of secondary education.  The technical school and the vo-
cational training center would be located in Asuncion where the largest de-
mand for manpower in manufacturing exists. The project would also include
33 man-years of expert services and 23 man-years of fellowships for local
staff in support of curriculum development and teaching of technical subjects
and for project implementation.



- ii -
v.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$7.3 million, of
which 66% would be for buildings and equipment, 13% for technical assistance
and 21% for contingencies. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
US$4.2 million, or 57% of total project cost. The estimated unit costs
compare favorably with those for similar Bank Group-assisted institutions
elsewhere. Contracts would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding.
vi.       Subject to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Chapter
VII, the project is suitable as a basis for an IDA Credit of US$5.1 million,
about 70% of the total estimated project cost. The credit would meet the
estimated foreign exchange component (US$4.2 million) and US$0.9 million
would cover 28% of local currency costs, including the estimated amount
($170,000) of furniture bids that are likely to be won by local manufacturers.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN PARAGUAY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Unesco mission visited Paraguay in September 1966, to identify
an education project for Bank/IDA financing. Further discussions with the
government took place on education policy and planning which the government
finalized in September 1970. At the government's request, project prepara-
tion was postponed till March 1971, when a Unesco mission assisted the
government in preparing the present project. The project was appraised in
July/August 1971, by a mission composed of Messrs. A. Freire (General Educator),
J. Theodores (Architect), N. McEvers (Economist) and F.A. Gomez (Technical
Educator, Unesco). During appraisal, the proposed project underwent rela-
tively minor modifications to which the Government has agreed.
II. THE SETTING
Socio-economic Background
2.01      Paraguay's population of 2.4 million is growing at the rapid rate
of 3.4% p.a. Approximately 46% is under 15 years of age; 64% of the popula-
tion is classified as rural and 36% as urban of which about one half lives
in Asuncion. According to a census taken in 1962, 25% of the population
was illiterate; this percentage is estimated to have decreased to 21%
in 1970. The adult population of Paraguay is bilingual (Spanish and Guara-
ni). The only language spoken by most infants in the rural areas is Guarani.
The first year in education is mainly devoted to teaching them Spanish - the
otficial study language.
2.02      Paraguay's economy expanded at an average rate of 4.6% p.a. during
the period 1965/70. Average per capita GDP, at $247, is low by Latin American
standards. Agriculture, livestock and forestry provide most of the exports
and about a third of GDP. Cattle-raising has been the principal activity,
although Paraguay's agricultural resources are suitable to more diversified
production. Industry (accounting for 19% of GDP) and the service sectors
(49% of GDP) have begun to expand in recent years and offer favorable pro-
spects for the future.
2.03      The labor force of 700,000 has been increasing at roughly 3.5%
p.a.; 53.6% is employed in the primary sectors, 14.6% in industry, 2.7%
in construction, 2.5% in basic services (power, transport, communications)
and 20.6% in commerce, government and other services.  Unemployment is fairly
high (6.0%) and underemployment is widespread particularly in the rural sec-
tor.
Economic Development Strategy
2.04      The government's new development strategy outlined in its 1971/75
plans is designed to change the pattern of modest growth and limited diversi-



-2-
fication which so far has characterized Paraguay's economy. This strategy
aims at accelerating the growth of the commodity-producing sectors to attain
a 6% annual growth in GDP. Primary production (livestock, forestry, agri-
culture) will be expanded by at least 4.6% p.a., and manufacturing and con-
struction at 9.2% p.a. (compared with 5.8% p.a. during 1965/70). Achieve-
ment of the overall growth will require an increase in export receipts at
a rate of at least 8%' p.a., which in turn will depend on a continuation of
favorable world prices for beef and success in developing facilities for
processing agricultural and forestry products, and in the exploitation of
Paraguay's tourism potential. The new strategy will benefit mainly the
central and southern regions of Paraguay's interior where a good deal of
agricultural activity as well as the country's major forestry reserves are
located. In order to reach its development objectives, it will also be
necessary for the government to increase both its revenues and public savings.
The government has recognized this need and has agreed to specific fiscal
targets for 1972 and 1973 with tlie Inter-American Committee for the Alliance
for Progress (CIAP).
2.05      For the success of the government's economic development efforts,
greater efficiency in production will be needed which, in turn, will require
a competent work force. Growth and diversification of production for both
local market and export will require a better educated and more skilled
pool of manpower than has been available heretofore.  At present, the pro-
portion of workers with secondary, technical and vocational education is
very low (Annex 21). Employers report that this lack of properly trained,
skilled workers and technicians reduces efficiency, adversely affects the
productivity of high-level personnel and, in some cases, endangers the suc-
cess of expansion plans.
Manpower Requirements
2.06      Although detailed data are lacking, available manpower analyses
indicate that the order of magnitude of add4tional manpower requirements
during the period 1970-1980 by various educational levels will be as follows:
University degree or equivalent            5,800
Completed secondary educatLon            63,000
Post-primary, vocational training         51,000
Within these broad categories, there are the following particular types of
manpower urgently needed -n key sectors of the economy.
2.07      In agriculture, the needs are a substantial improvement in the
low-skill levels and more effective programs for extending modern methods
and techniques to farmers throughout the country. The agricultural services
cannot provide adequate coverage for this purpose and need to be strengthened
at the intermediate level. An expanded program of agricultural training,
assisted by the IDB, will supply 100 of the 140 secondary agricultural grad-
uates required to meet the average annual needs until 1979. Under the same



-3-
program, the enrollment capacity of Paraguay's five vocational agricultural
schools will be raised from 150 to 560. Finally, IDB is financing a scheme
of mobile extension units which are expected to train 4,000 farmers a year.
2.08      Industrial expansion will require skilled workers as entrepreneurs
turn to more capital-intensive and technically-advanced processes. Both ex-
port industries and industries such as textile, leather and construction
materials which serve a growing domestic market will require 300-400 skiled
craftsmen annually. Need is particularly strong for craftsmen trained in
building and road construction, general and other mechanics, electriciv-
and electronics, refrigeration mechanics and chemistry. Whilst most of
these requirements are concentrated in the Asuncion area, there is also
demand for skilled mechanics and electricians in central ard southern
Paraguay to service the Agricultural Mechanization Program, to maintain
and repair machinery in lumbermills, to maintain and repair road building
and maintenance equipment and to help install and maintain new generating
plants and transmission lines under the Rural Electrification Program. There
are no training institutions at present to produce these craftsmen.
2.09      Although precise quantification is not available, there is ample
evidence that the requirements for additional, semi-skilled workers in the
above-mentioned fields are far in excess of existing, formal training ca-
pacities. Furthermore, the Ministry of Labor has calculated that annually
some 2,500-3,000 workers in industry, construction and infrastructure serv-
ices, classified as semi-skilled, need to be upgraded or retrained.
2.10      Mlost sectors also experience shortages of adequately trained,
middle-level commercial personnel. Approximately 20,000 office and sales
workers at this level are needed up to 1980. Accountants and bookkeepers,
in particular, are in high demand in banking, commerce and tourism. In ad-
dltion to special skills, a certain breadth of commercial training is re-
quired so that secondary level commerce graduates can advance to super-
visory positions and develop some of the managerial and enterpreneurial
talents needed for future economic expansion.
III. EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
General
3.01      The Ministry of Education and Worship is responsible for public
primary and secondary education and also for controlling curricula and exami-
nations of private schools. Public and private universities are autonomous.
The administration of the Ministry is highly centralized; duplication of
efforts results from lack of a clear delineation of responsibilities betw.een
departments and lack of coordination. There is little delegation of
responsibilities so that the Minister of Education has often to resolve
minor problems.  The organization of the Ministry is shown in Chart I.



- 4 -
3.02      A description of the education and training system is given in
Appendix I. This chapter summarizes the main features. The educational
pyramid and supporting tables are at Chart II and Annexes 2-8. The educa-
tion system consists of pre-primary education, six years of primary educa-
tion, three years of lower secondary education (grades 7-9) followed by
three years of upper secondary education (grades 10-12) and four, five or
six year university courses (Chart III). This structure has recently been
adapted to the country's needs and is in accordance with the new educational
structure of most Latin American countries; this permits student transfers
within the region without loss of time or disturbance of the educational
process.
Primary Education
3.03      Primary education is free in public schools and compulsory be-
tween the ages of 7 and 14.  Enrollments of about 424,000 in 1970 rep-
resent 89% of the age group 7-12, which is higher than other Latin American
countries (Ecuador 71%, Colombia 70%), and are expected to grow to 553,000 or
93% of the age group by 1980.  Primary education is characterized by entry
of overage students, irregular attendance, a high percentage of repeaters
and a high dropout rate. Yet the pupil:teacher ratio (26:1) is one of the
lowest in the region and as many as 79% of the teachers are formally qual-
ified.  Major causes of the unfavorable results are early withdrawal of
pupils from schools for economic reasons, the large numbers (about 44%) of
inadequate schools offering not more than one, two or three years of in-
struction, improper curricula and poor quality of supervision. Low quality
of the present primary teacher training program may also be a factor.,
Secondary Education
3.04      Secondary education consists of a three-year lower cycle (grades
7-9), followed by a three-year upper cycle (grades 10-12). The latter offers
courses in humanities and sciences, in commerce and in primary school teacher
training. Technical and agricultural education at this level is limited to
one school for each.  In its present form, secondary education is not suffi-
ciently responsive to the country's economic needs. Curricula are highly
academic and the scope for effective technical or vocational training is
very limited.
3.05      Total enrollment in secondar- education in 1970 was 56,000 or 17.2%
of the age group, which is relatively low by Latin American standards. En-
rollment projections show 102,000 students (or 23% of the age group) by
1980 (Annex 4). As a result of higher efficiency in the educational system,
which would be brought about by a new curriculum and better qualified
teachers, the number of secondary school graduates is expected to increase
from about 4,400 in 1970 to 12,000 in 1980.



-5-
3.06      Private secondary education, which accounts for about 52% of the
total enrollments, is mainly under religious orders or private associations
which receive grants from abroad. Private schools are very selective; they
accept pupils whose parents can afford fees between $160-$240 per year.
Educational standards are considered to be higher than in public schools;
part of the teaching staff is hired on a full-time basis and salaries are
some 50% higher than for government teachers. However, as in public schools,
equipment and teaching materials are often inadequate and teaching methods
need to be improved.
3.07      At present, about 40% of the students entering secondary schools
finish the six-year cycle. The high percentage dropout is attributed to:
(a) early entry in the laber market to supplement family income, (b) school
curricula which are unrelated to the students' environment and job opportun-
ities, (c) unsuitable school buildings and equipment and (d) lack of quali-
fied teachers, Teaching emphasizes memorization of factual knowledge rele-
vant only to success in passing examinations instead of providing well or-
ganized programs and work syllabuses.
3.08      The present low level of teachers' salaries offers no incentive
to well-qualified candidates to enter the teaching profession and those
already in the education system are compelled to work overtime or to obtain
a second job which gives them little time for preparation for classes. Tn
1970, only 45% of the 3,800 secondary school teachers were considered qual-
ified. The teacher:student ratio of 1:15 is too low and can be raised which
would permit recruitment of full-time qualified teachers at higher salaries
and procurement of better teaching equipment.
3.09      At present, most students (60%) in the upper cycle are taking
courses in humanities and sciences, graduation from this program carrying
higher prestige and the opportunity of entry into the universities. In
1970, 54% of the 2,500 graduates continued their studies in the universi-
ties which is low compared with other Latin American countries. For the
remainder, jobs are difficult to find because they lack practical experi-
ence, since laboratory and workshop facilities are almost non-existent in
the secondary schools.
3.10      Commercial Education.  Enrollments are fairly high at 19% of
total secondary enrollments. But courses are oriented towards office ad-
ministration and secretarial duties and do not meet the requirements of
banking, insurance companies, and import-export companies, which require
graduates better trained in accounting and other commercial skills. About
40% of the 640 graduates in 1970 are now enrolled in higher education, the
rest having taken office jobs. None of the schools offering commercial
courses is adequately equipped and the teachers have not had specific
training for the subjects taught.
3.11      Primary teacher training (20% of the total secondary enrollments)
was being provided for 3,500 students in 40 schools (19 private) in 1970.
Graduates in the same year numbered 1,200 which is greatly in excess of the



-6-
country's teacher requirements and of the budgetary allocations for new
teacher posts. The program of primary school teacher training at the sec-
ondary level is being phased out; the Government is introducing a new scheme
at post-secondary level. In order to meet the annual requirements of 500 to
600 new teachers, eight post-secondary institutions will eventually replace
the existing 40 teacher training schools.
Technical Education and Vocational Training
3.12      Technical education is limited to evening courses in only one
school at the upper secondary level. Total enrollment in 1970 was 141 and
22 students graduated in that year in the fields of building construction,
electricity, mechanics and industrial chemistry. The courses are held in
primary school classrooms with no laboratories or workshop facilities. The
majority of teachers are considered unqualified. Graduates from the school
do not meet industry's requirements for middle level trained personnel.
3.13      Vocational training is provided by one public school in Asuncion
and a number of small private schools throughout the country.  The total
1970 enrollment was 1,044 and 208 semi-skilled workers graduated in various
craft skills. Again emphasis is placed on academic subjects rather than
practical training. Workshop facilities are mostly obsolescent and although
teachers work on a full-time basis they lack experience in vocational train-
ing and programmirg.
Agricultural Education and Training
3.14      The Ministry of Agriculture operates five regional agricultural
education centers ei lowei secondary level.  Total enrollment in 197C was
150 and yearly outpi't is es -4.uated at 80. The IDB and the Swiss Govern-
ment are financing the expansion of three of these centers and the construc-
tion of two additional schoois at a total cost of US$1.6 million. Only one
private school at the uppar secondary level, the "Escuela Carlos Pfarnl"
gives courses leading to a diploma   Equipment and teaching media to this
school are being improved with assistance from the IDB and the Federal
Republic of Germany at a total cost of US$0,." million.
Higher Education
3.15      Higher education is provided a- two autonomous universities (one
public and one private) and in the Higher Institute of Education. Total
enrollment for 1970 was 8,119 and there were 734 graduates. Courses are
from three to six years' duration. Liberal and fine arts account for 4/%
of total enrollment; education and philosophy for 22%; engineering aAd
science for 13%; medical science for 12%; and agriculture for 6% (Annex 5).



-7-
Secondary Teacher Training
3.16      Secondary teacher training is carried out at the universities
and at the Higher Institute of Education. The total enrollment in the
teacher training program in these institutions was 1,900 in 1970 and there
were 260 graduates. The quality of teachers turned out is low and the gov-
ernment is taking steps to improve teacher training by providing pedagogical
and practical orientation for the graduates from the universities and courses
for upgrading the present teacher force. The Higher Institute of Education
is receiving technical assistance from Unesco (US$0.8 million) for teacher
training programs. The Institute of Basic Sciences of the National Univer-
sity will continue training science teachers for the upper cycle. UNDP is
providing US$1.1 million for technical assistance and equipment to improve
their science teacher programs.
IV. EDUCATION FINANCES
General
4.01      Most public education and training in Paraguay is financed by
the Central Government. Primary education is free but public secondary
schools charge a nominal annual fee of ¢ 1,250 ($10). Over 85% of the
National University budget is funded by the Central Government and the
rest by student fees. Private primary schools receive modest amounts of
financial aid from the Government, whilst private secondary institutions
rely almost exclusively on school fees which are quite high in some cases.
Public resources account for 84% of total education expenditure while the
remaining 16% is derived from various private sources (Annex 9).
Education Expenditure
4.02      The Government has been devoting too small a part of its resources
to education. Paraguay's total national outlay on education and training is
estimated at 2.7% of GDP which is low in comparison with that of other
countries (Colombia 4.0, Ecuador 3.2). Public spending on education was
less than US$6.00 per capita in 1970, as compared with a range of US$8.00
to US$26.00 per capita in other Latin American countries. Of total public
investment in 1964/69, education claimed only 1.5%. In 1970, capital
outlays represented only 2.2% of the Ministry's total expenditures.  No
capital investment has been made in public secondary schools in the last
16 years, although enrollments have tripled; hence, most pupils are now ac-
commodated in makeshift facilities that are inadequate and uneconomic.
4.03      The budget of the Ministry of Education (which accounts for 90% of
public education expenditure) rose by only 9.6% p.a. between 1962 and 1970
as compared with 12.5% p.a. for overall government expenditures. As a result,
the percentage share of the Ministry of Education in the total Central Gov-



- 8 -
ernment budget dropped from 15.6% in 1962 to 12.7% in 1970. Including educa-
tion expenditures of other government agencies, 14% of the budget was spent on
education in 1970.
4.04      Recurrent expenditure on education by the Central Government and
other governmental agencies in 1970 was distributed as follows: primary
58%, secondary 11%, teacher training 2%, vocational-technical (excluding
military schools) 3%, agriculture 0.6%, higher 15%, administration and other
programs 10.4%. The allocations for secondary and vocational-technical
education are unusually low. Recurrent costs per student, shown in Annex 11,
amounted to $17 for primary, $55 for secondary and $140 for vocational-techni-
cal education. These unit costs are low when compared with other Latin
American countries and with other countries at the same level of per capita
income (Annex 11).
4.05      Furthermore, the return on the limited amount of government spend-
ing on education is impaired by high wastage rates, too low pupil:teacher
ratios, uneconomic distribution and use of physical facilities and small
school size, particularly in the interior. Provisions for books, teaching
materials, school maintenance and replacement of furniture and equipment are
inadequate and community donations are not sufficient to satisfy normal
requirements. Teachers' salaries are too low, even in relation to those of
other public servants of comparable rank and qualification. Teachers are
therefore compelled to teach two and even three shifts and to divide their
professional attention among several schools.  The resulting practices of
part-time, casual employment and of hourly pay have been major obstacles to
the development of a professional cadre of secondary school teachers.
4.06      To achieve a more rational and effective use of the financial re-
sources devoted to education, there is also need for a change in the distrib-
ution of recurrent education expenditures in favor of secondary and vocation-
al-technical education. The multitude of small secondary schools and teacher
training colleges should be consolidated and, where appropriate, pupil:teacher
ratios should be raised. The savings thus achieved could then be used to pay
higher salaries to more qualified teachers, provide better equipment and im-
prove and expand technical education and vocational training. The proposed
project will be a significant first step towards this end. The combined ef-
fect of the improvements would raise the unit cost in secondary education
from $55 in 1970 to $77 in 1980 - a relatively modest increase of 40% over
a ten-year period of which about half would be due to higher teacher cost
and half to improved equipment.
External Assistance
4.07      USAID has been the principal source of assistance in the past,
having provided grant funds for four Regional Education Centers and for the
National University's Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine. Through
a US$1.5 million loan, IDB has helped the National University to expand and
modernize its facilities and to upgrade the calibre of instruction given at



-9-
its Faculty of Social Sciences.  Fellowships, experts and equiipment from
the OAS, UNDP, UNICEF and UNESCO have been devoted to a review of primary
and lower secondary school curricula and to secondary teacher training.
4.08      Current foreign aid programs include an AID loaa. of $4.2 million
to construct and equip 120 primary schools, new facilities for the Higher
Institute of Education and for primary teacher training, and technical as-
sistance for teacher training and for primary education.  A UNDP/Special
Fund project ($1.1 million) for the Institute of Basic Sciences will be
devoted to upgrading the training of science teachers for secondary schools.
Three lower level, secondary agriculture schools will be expanded, two new
ones will be constructed, and a private school to produce agriculture tech-
nicians will also be expanded with an IDB loan of $2.3 million. Finally,
IDB is considering a possible loan of $3.5 million to construct more facilities
at the National University.
Outlook
4.09      Estimates of future costs have been made on the assumptions that
the steps outlined in para. 4.06 would be taken and that primary and second-
ary enrollments would increase to 93% and 23% of the respective age groups
by 1980. These assumptions are in accord with the government's current
plans and with the past trends. The quantitative targets are not overly
ambitious and should not conflict with the objectives of qualitative improve-
ment in secondary education, provided the government wzill raise the overall
budgetary allocations to education. To achieve both quantitative and qual-
itative development targets, the budget of the Ministry of Education, in-
clusive of university subsidies, will have to rise from 0 1.5 billion in
1970 to ¢ 2.5 billion in 1975 and ¢ 3.5 billion in 1980, or by 66% and 40%
for the 1970/75 and 1975/80 periods respectively (Annex 10). About 3% of
the latter amount would result from the proposed project. These increases
would be much higher than the 33% increase achieved during the period 1966/70
and may result in an increase in the proportion of the Central Government's
budget devoted to education, including university subsidies, from 14% in 1970
to more than 18% in 1980. The addition of ongoing and planned programs of
other public sector agencies and of estimated private expenditures could
bring the total national outlay for education and training from 2.7% to 3.5%
of the estimated GDP (Annex 10). These percentages are not high by interna-
tional standards. During negotiations, the government's plans for future
educational development were discussed and agreement reached that the govern-
ment would increase the percentage allocation to education in the national
budget during the remainder of the decade to achieve the quantitative and
qualitative educational goals that have been established.  Specifically, the
government recognized the need for providing the Ministry of Education with
the budgetary allocations for 1975 and 1980 noted above.  This provision
would be in accordance with recent CIAP and USAID recommendations to the
Government for increased financial support to education and with a recent
undertaking by the Covernment to USAID that it will increase annually, as
much as possible, the percentage of the national budget devoted to education.

V. EDUCATION AND TRAINING NEEDS
General
5.01      Development of the Paraguayan education system to improve its
quality and internal efficiency and to make it more responsive to the needs
of the country will require steps which are outlined below and which are
included in the Government's Education Development Plan 1969-1980.  The
Government is receiving considerable external assistance to promote them
in a number of fields (Annex 12), but additional assistance is required,
particularly in secondary and technical-vocational education. The proposed
project addresses itself to the needs in the latter fields.
Education Administration
5.02      Operating procedures of the Ministry of Education need improvement,
particularly the administrative, accounting and budgeting practices. Advice
in this field is being received from USAID. The Government has recently es-
tablished a Central Budgeting and Accounting Office to enable a more efficient
use of funds. In addition, a Central Coordinating Committee has been set up
to coordinate activities under the Education Department Plan. This central
committee is assisted by USAID, UNICEF, IDB and Unesco. Additional help is
required for project implementation.
Primary Education
5.03      In primary education efforts must be made to improve the quality
of teaching and supervision and to reduce the high rate of dropout and.
class repetition. The Government, assisted by USAID, has started a program
aimed at such improvements which include the construction of new primary
schools, curriculum reform, construction of three Regional Education Centers
(which provide primary, secondary and teacher training courses and supervi-
sion of primary schools in their respective regions), construction of a
teacher training school, and textbook production.
Secondary Education
5.04      The present imbalance between general secondary and technical/
vocational education should be redre-sed if the Government is to meet the
needs for middle level manpower of industry, commerce and agriculture
(paras 2.07-2.10). To that effect, not only should technical education and
vocational training be improved and expanded, but also the structure
and content of secondary education as a whole should be reformed to make
the system more responsive to the economic and social needs of the country.
A new type of secondary school (the multilateral school) is desirable to
expose all students in the junior cycle to practical pre-vocational train-
ing and to offer, in the senior cycle, both regular academic education and
technical-vocational training.



5.05      In addition, the present multitude of small secondary schools
should be consolidated in larger, more economical school units with higher
staff:student ratios. New and better school buildings are required with
modern equipment to replace inadequate facilities.
5.06      The present system of part-time teaching (para 3.08) should
be phased out and a program developed for the building of a strong cadre
of professionally qualified full-time teachers, as the training and re-
training courses at the Higher Institute of Education progress. A new
salary scale is needed to make the teaching profession competitive with
other professions requiring comparable training and experience. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the government that by the
end of 1974 a program will be prepared leading to the establishment of a
graduated salary structure for teachers based on a job description which
takes into account qualifications and length and quality of service, and
to the appointment of full-time teachers for the schools included in the
project, based on this new (and higher) salary scale. The Government
would also progressively introduce beginning in 1976 the new salary scale
in other similar schools and appoint full-time teachers to at least two-
thirds of all teaching posts by 1980.
5.07      Facilities for technical education and vocational training for
employment by industry remain very limited (paras. 3.12 and 3.14) and,
since few firms provide suitable on-the-job training, many positions in
industry are filled by expatriates or by Paraguayans trained in neighboring
countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile). In 1971, the Government decided to
(i) establish a Department of Vocational and Technical Education in the
Ministry of Education; (ii) establish a Joint Committee, with representation
of government and industry, to coordinate training programs and assure that
the output is in accordance with manpower needs; (iii) improve and expand
technical education and training at upper secondary level to produce skilled
craftsmen and prepare graduates for further technical training; and (iv)
establish a vocational training program in shorter courses of varying
duration for those who have dropped out of the formal education system.
5.08      To implement this program, the Government will require substantial
capital and technical assistance. In addition to the introduction of tech-
nical courses at senior level of the multilateral schools (para. 5.04), the
Government needs support for the establishment of a new technical secondary
school in Asuncion (where industry is concentrated) to provide a broad varie-
ty of 3-year technical courses, at upper secondary level, to train skilled
workers.  Moreover, the existing vocational school at Asuncion needs to be
remodeled, reorganized and re-equipped to provide shorter courses for semi-
skilled workers.
5.09      Technical assistance is also required to establish and administer
the new Department of Vocational and Technical Education, to develop the
curricula for the technical courses, to provide technical teachers in the



- 12 -
initial years, and to train local technical teachers. The Government is
expected to receive technical assistance and fellowships from the OAS and
from technical institutes in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, for the technical
teacher training program at the Higher Institute of Education. Additional
assistance will be needed for the new department, for curriculum development
and for teaching in the technical schools.
5.10      Agricultural education.  A substantial part of the need for ex-
panding middle level agricultural education and farmer training is being
met by the IDB which provides assistance to agricultural secondary education,
vocational agricultural schools and farmer training (paras. 2.07 and 3.14).
Secondary Teacher Training
5.11      For secondary schools, improvement of teacher quality and better
utilization of existing teachers rather than an increase in their numbers
are required. The present teacher:student ratio of 1:15 is far too low and,
with establishment of a full-time teacher system and a more economical
teacher:student ratio of 1:25, very little increase in the number of teachers
will be needed from 1970 to 1980 (1970: 3,770 - 1980: 4,000). To meet re-
quirements for normal replacement and limited expansion, an annual output of
about 220 teachers is needed and this number can be supplied through existing
secondary teacher training programs. To improve teacher qualifications, the
Higher Institute of Education, with Unesco technical assistance, is expanding
and strengthening its in-service training programs which will provide re-
training for about 180 teachers p.a. As a result, about 90% of the teaching
force in secondary education is likely to be qualified by 1980.
5.12      By 1973, the Higher Institute of Education will also start courses
for training teachers in technical fields to meet the demand of the multi-
lateral and technical secondary schools and the vocational training center.
Curricula for these courses have been established but practical training in
local industry has still to be arranged. An assurance on the latter point
was obtained during negotiations. Courses for industrial arts teachers for
the lower level of rural secondary schools will have an agricultural bias
(Annexes 7 and 8).
Higher Education
5.13      Manpower needs at higher professional level are less pressing
than at middle level; in some fields, a small surplus of university gradu-
ates is already apparent. There will no doubt be needs for further expansion
and particularly for quality improvement. The Government expects to receive
an IDB loan of $3.5 million for construction and equipping of new buildings,
inclusive of science facilities, at the National University.

VI.  THE PROJECT
General
6.01      The project is designed to help finance priority investments in
secondary education, technical education and vocational training to meet
the needs outlined in paras. 5.04 - 5.09 above. It would consist of:
a.   construction and equipment of seven new multilateral
secondary schools and extending and remodeling of
existing facilities for another multilateral school;
b.   construction and equipment of a new technical secondary
school;
c.   extension and remodeling of an existing vocational train-
ing center;
d.   technical assistance for project implementation and for
developing technical education.
6.02      The following table summarizes the project, (items a, b and c
above); more details are given in Annexes 13 and 14.

/1   The school's capacity is 240.  It would serve approximately 1000
students yearly in short, intensive, craft-skill courses.
The project schools are designed for use in a double shift system and would
be used for about 70 periods or 55 hours per week which is a high utiliza-
tion rate. Rotating classes would also assume a high use factor of class-
rooms, laboratories and workshops.



- 14 -
Multilateral Schools
6.03      Of the eight multilateral schools, four would be in rural areas
and the remaining four in Asuncion. The new schools would replace 22 small,
inadequately equipped secondary schools which have been housed in poorly
arranged primary school buildings. As soon as the project schools are in
operation, the 22 schools will be converted to primary education.
6.04      The schools would introduce a new concept in secondary education
and provide such new programs as guidance service, practical pre-vocational
studies in industrial arts, home economics and agriculture at the lower
cycle and elective vocational courses in mechanics, electricity and commerce
at the upper cycle. The new buildings would permit flexibility in curricula
and programs. The curricula, now amended, are satisfactory.
6.05      The four rural multilateral schools would emphasize agriculture
in the lower cycle. Hence, each school would have enough land (about 9 ha)
for agricultural practice. At the upper cycle, the schools would offer new
programs in humanities, science, commerce, general mechanics and electricity;
separate agricultural schools outside the project are providing agricultural
courses at the upper cycle level. Each school would have workshops which
would also be used in short term or evening training courses in specific
trades for adults and school dropouts.
6.06      In the Asuncion area, the other four multilateral schools would
emphasize industrial arts and home economics in the lower cycle and offer
programs in humanities, science and commerce in the upper cycle. Because
of the concentrated school population in Asuncion, the technical industrial
programs would be offered at the proposed new technical school in Asuncion.
6.07      The project multilateral schools would be coeducational and would
provide a total of about 10,000 student places (attending the schools in
two shifts) by 1976. This would represent 25% of the projected enrollment
in the public secondary schools by that year. Since a number of existing
secondary schools will be closed, the net expansion resulting from the pro-
ject will be about 3,000 places and these are provided especially in rural
schools (Annex 13). The schools would not require boarding facilities or
staff housing.
6.08      Qualified teachers for the oroject schools would be transferred
from the existing schools (after receiv-ng additional training through in-
service courses offered by the Higher Institute of Education) and directly
from the Schools of Education at the Universities or the Higher Institute.
Provision has been made for the training of teachers of industrial arts,
home economics and agriculture at the Higher Institute of Education. The
government has given assurance that all thie teaching staff will be hired
on a full-time basis and, as a Part of the program to introduce a new pay scale
(para. 5.06), receive adequate salaries to enable them to devote their full
time to the project institutions.



- 15
Secondary Technical School
6.09      This item would provide for constructing and equipping a new
technical secondary school in Asuncion. This school would train, in a
3-year course at upper-secondary level, middle-level skilled workmen who
would also be able to fill supervisory positions in industry after a period
of industrial experience. The school would offer eleven specialized programs
in mechanics, electricity, civil construction and chemistry. The programs
would include 30% of general subjects and 70% of professional subjects. In
the professional subjects substantial time would be devoted to practical
training (41%). The school would replace the existing "Escuela de Tecnicos
Industriales" which offers only evening courses in classrooms with no work-
shop or laboratory facilities.
6.10      Total enrollment in the school would be 840 (attending in two
shifts), producing a yearly output of about 260 skilled workmen: 60 in
electrical trades (electro-mechanics, electrical installation, electronics);
100 in mechanics (general mechanics, auto mechanics, diesel mechanics, re-
frigeration); 60 in civil construction (building construction, public works,
technical draftsmen) and 40 in chemistry (industrial chemistry, pharmaceuti-
cal chemistry). A total of 58 full-time teachers would be required (40 in
technical fields and 18 in general education).
Vocational Training Center
6.11      The project would provide for remodeling and re-equipping the ex-
isting "Escuela Tecnica Vocacional Carlos A. Lopez" as a vocational center
with a capacity of 240 student places. It would operate on a double-shift
basis and train annually about 1,000 youths and adults in carpentry, auto-
mechanics, electrical installation, plumbing, welding, painting, leather
and other trades where the demand is greatest.. The training program would
be organized on a modular basis with four units of about 1l weeks each an-
nually. Each module would be complete within itself, providing the skill
elements for a particular job. After completing the first module, students
not yet employed mav seek employment as semi-skilled workers or continue with
the next module to improve their skills. A complete training program in
painting or welding may require three modules, while in auto mechanics or
electrical installation five or six modules would be necessary. With this
system students could take their basic training or upgrading when convenient
and according to their previous vocational knowledge and experience.
6.12      The technical and vocational programs of the Secondary Technical
School and the Vocational Training Center would be organized in cooperation
with industry. During negotiations the government gave assurance that a
joint working committee, with representation of government and industry,
would be established before the end of 1973 to advise the government on
industrial training needs, on the direction and content of the courses and
on the placement of graduates. Before the end of 1974, a detailed review



- 16 -
should be made of the need for skilled and semi-skilled workers in private
industry and in governmental undertakings by major field of specialization.
Before the opening of the Vocational Training Center, the government would
submit to the Association, for its comments, the operational program for
the Center's first two years of operations, based on this review. The
program would contain information about the student intake, enrollment and
expected output in each of the trades.
6.13      Qualified teachers and instructors for the technical school and
vocational center would be transferred from the existing technical institu-
tions (after receiving additional training) and directly from the Higher
Institute of Education (para. 5.12). The government has given assurance
that all the teaching staff will be hired on full-time basis and receive
adequate salary to enable them to devote their full time to the project
technical/vocational institutions.
Technical Assistance
6.14      The project would include 33 man-years of technical assistance and
23 man-years of fellowships for assisting the government in (a) developing
and implementing new curricula and syllabi for the technical courses in the
multilateral, vocational and technical schools, for the teaching of technical
subjects and for the training of local staff; and (b) supervising and coordi-
nating project implementation (paras. 5.07, 5.08, 5.09). Details are given
in Appendix II. The British Government has indicated its interest in provid-
ing three technical education specialists for the proposed project. If this
aid materializes, the amount of the IDA credit would be reduced or re-
allocated. All technical experts financed under the Credit would be acceptable
to the Association and would be supported through the appointment of counterpart
staff. During negotiations the government agreed to a plan for the timely
recruitment of the experts and for the recruitment and training of counter-
part staff (Annex 18).
Evaluation of Project Results
6.15      To enable the government and IDA to assess the success of the pro-
ject in attaining its objectives, the government would establish a "tracer
system" for all project institutions and for a limited number of the more
traditional secondary schools in order to obtain reliable information on
the further education and/or employment of school leavers. Records would
also be kept on the rate of drop-out and repetition in the same institutions.

Cost of the Project
6.16       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at 0925.5 million
or US$7.35 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost estimate amounts to
US$4.16 million equivalent or 57% of the total estimated cost. A breakdown

of the new multilateral secondary schools in US$68 per m    Tnis cost and
estimated unit costs per student place of project institutions are reason-
able in comparison with other Bank-IDA financed projects (Annex 16). A local
cost adjustment of 10-20% has been included for schools outside the Asuncion
area to allow for transportation costs and the lack of local skilled labor.
Site development costs vary between 10-15% of the building costs depending
on conditions of each site.
6.19      Furniture and equipment cost estimates are based on 1971 prices.
Detailed lists would be compiled during project implementation for which
technical assistance would be provided under the project.
6.20      Contingency allowances included in the total cost of the project
are shown in detail in Annex 17.. For physical contingencies, 10% is added
to the cost estimates for site development, construction, furniture, equip-
ment and professional services.  Price increases are estimated at 3% per
annum for all local expenditures whereas foreign price increases are esti-
mated at 6% for civil works and at 5% for furniture, equipment, technical
assistance and fellowships. Overall, contingencies would be equivalent to
about 21% of the total estimated cost of the project, or 27% of the total
cost without contingencies.
Execution of the Project
6.21      A Project Unit would be established in the Ministry of Education
for (a) supervision of project implementation; (b) coordination with other
government services; and (c) liaison with the Association. The Unit would
consist of the following full-time staff: a project director, an educator,
an architect, a procurement officer, an accountant and adequate supporting
staff. Appointments of the project director, educator and the project
architect would be acceptable to the Association. During negotiations the
government gave assurance that the Project Unit would be established and the
director, educator and architect would be appointed before April 30, 1973;
that the procurement officer and the accountant would be appointed within
two months after the effective date of the Credit Agreement; and that the
Unit would be provided with adequate office space, furniture, equipment and
transportation. The cost of the Project Unit would be financed by the
.government except for US$20,000 included in the Credit for equipment,
furniture and a vehicle for project use, all to be procured in accordance
with bid practices acceptable to the Association.



- 20 -
6.22      The proposed project provides for the employment of two experts
(an architect and an equipment procurement specialist) wiho would train and
assist their counterparts in the project unit during the first stages of
project implementation. The architect-consultant would be responsible mainly
for the development of architectural briefs and school construction standards.
The equipment procurement specialist would assist with the preparation of
furniture and equipment lists and specifications. The government has given
assurance that these two specialists would be employed not later than six
months after the effective date of the Credit Agreement. The design and
supervision of construction would be carried out by private local architects.
6.23      Sites for all new schools and extensions included in the project
have been inspected and found acceptable except for two multilateral second-
ary schools, and the new Secondary Technical School, all being located in
Asuncion. For these schools, suitable sites, acceptable to the Association,
would be selected and acquired not later than six months after the effective
date of the Credit Agreement.
Procurement
6.24     All contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment and for
construction work would be awarded under international competitive bidding.
All items would be grouped to the extent practicable to encourage competi-
tion. The construction industry in Paraguay is capable of meeting the needs
of the project and it is unlikely that the project would attract many foreign
bidders except for equipment, most of which would be imported. Domestic
manufacturers would be accorded a margin of preference which would be the
existing rate of customs duty applicable to competing imports or 15% of the
c.i.f. price, whichever is the lower.
Disbursement
6.25    - The proposed Credit would finance US$5.1 million equivalent, or
70% of the total project cost. This would cover the estimated foreign ex-
change component (57%) plus 28% of local project costs, including the
estimated amount of furniture bids that are likely to be won by local manu-
facturers ($170,000) (Annex 15). The credit would be disbursed on the
basis of:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported furniture and equipment
and 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally produced furni-
ture and equipment;
(b) 100% of foreign costs of technical assistance;
(c)  54% of the cost of construction; and
(d) 45% of the cost of professional architectural services.



- 21 -
If total project costs fall below the estimated cost, the tindisbursed amount
would be cancelled unless the Association otherwise agrees.
6.26      The construction and equipping of schools would be completed in
about four years, but the provision of technical assistance would extend
over a period of six years (Annex 18); the schedule of disbursements for
this period is shown in Annex 19.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached that the goverrment:
(i) would not make expenditures for school construct-ion, equipment
and furniture, until it had furnished the Association evidence
satisfactory to it that it had achieved, or was likely to
achieve, the fiscal targets agreed with the Inter-American
Committee for the Alliance for Progress (para 2.04);
(ii)  would improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of secondary
education by (a) increasing financial support to reach the
qualitative and quantitative educational goals that have been
established; (b) raising the proportion of the education bud-
get.allocated to secondary education; (c) consolidating small,
uneconomical schools into larger units with higher student;
staff ratios; and (d) increasing budgetary allocations for
school maintenance, equipment, books and teaching materials
(paras 4.05, 4.06 and 4.09);
(iii)  formulate a program for the establishment of a system of
full-time qualified teachers in public secondary schools and
a new salary scale that will allow secondary school teachers
to pursue their profession on a full-time basis (para 5.06);
(iv)  appoint only full-time, qualified teachers and principals to
project institutions (para 6.08);
(v) cause the Higher Institute of Education to offer courses for
the training of teachers of technical subjects and conclude
arrangements with industry to provide trainees in these
courses with practical industrial training (paras 5.12
and 6.13);
(vi)  establish a working committee to advise the government in
matters relating to its technical education and vocational
training courses (para 6.12);
(vii)  recruit technical assistance experts and award fellowships
for the training of local teaching staff (para 6.14);



- 22 -
(viii)  establish a tracer system for all institutions included in
the project and for other selected secondary schools
(para 6.15);
(ix)  acquire suitable sites for the project institutions
(para 6.23); and
(x)  establish a project unit in the Ministry of Education
(paras 6.21 and 6.22).
7.02      The proposed project is a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
$5.1 million to the Government of Paraguay, equal to 70% of the estimated
cost of the project.

APPENDIX I
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Administration:
The administration of public education in Paraguay (Chart I) is
highly centralized under the Ministry of Education which is responsible for
policy, finance, administration, curricula and supervision of public primary
and secondary education and in addition, for controlling curricula and exam-
inations of private schools. Public and private universities maintain an
autonomous status. Because of lack of clear delineation of the department's
responsibilities and absence of coordination, there is, in many cases, a
duplication of effort when dealing with educational matters. Authority
within the Ministry rests with the Minister himself and too many minor
problems are being left to his decision.
Within recent years, however, there have been several reforms
among which is the establishment of a Central Budgeting and Accounting
Office within the Ministry which will result in more efficient use of edu-
cation funds. A USAID expert has been advising the Ministry for the last
four years on Ministry operating procedures particularly on administrative,
accounting and budgeting practices. Recently a Central Ccordinating Commit-
tee has also been set up to implement, through the Education Planning Depart-
ment, the work program established by the Educational Development Plan
(1969-80). This Central Coordinating Committee which is to integrate the
activities of ten working committees is being advised by experts from USAID,
UNICEF, IDB, UNESCO.
Structure:
The education system (Chart III) consists of (a) a kindergarten
or pre-primary education for pupils of 5-6 years of age which is not obli-
gatory, (b) six years of free and compulsory primary education for children
between 7 and 14, (c) secondary education of three years of lower cycle
(grades 7 to 9) and three years of upper cycle (grades 10-12), divided
among the following majors: normal (primary teacher training), commercial,
humanities and science (university preparatory), technical industrial, and
agriculture and (d) four, five or six-year university courses. The official
language of instruction is Spanish although "Guarani" is widely spoken
throughout the country.
Pre-Primary and Primary Education:
There are 7,560 pupils, 5% of the 5-6 year age group, enrolled in
pre-primary education in Paraguay. There are only 6 separate kindergarten
schools, the major part of the program being provided in annexes to primary
schools without adequate teaching materials and equipment. Pre-primary



APPENDIX I
Page 2
schools in rural areas give high priority and devote much time to the
teaching of Spanish because about 50% of the age population in these areas
speak only "Guarani" and the official study language in the schools after
pre-primary education is Spanish.
In 1970 there were 3,045 primary schools in the country operating
in 2,469 buildings, All six grades are offered by only 25% of the rural
schools while they are offered by 92% of the urban schools.
The basic data for public and private primary schools in 1970 is
as follows:
Teacher/     % of      % of Age   Boys/
Pupil     Teachers   Group in   Girls
Grades   Enrollment   Teachers    Ratio        Qualified   School    Ratio
1-6      424,179       16,054      1:26          79%       105%      53:47
Primary education is free in public schools except for textbooks
and uniforms. Although statistics indicate that approximately 105% of the
elementary age group attend school, these figures include a high proportion
of overage pupils (over 12 years, estimate 16%). The retention rate is very
low and because compulsory education laws are not strictly enforced, only
17% of the pupils reach the end of the primary course in six years. In 1970
the repeaters represented 17.7%, of all the primary school enrollment (urban
zones 14.4% and rural zones 20.7%).
The drop-out rate in the primary education system is high and is
largely due to the following factors: (a) many schools do not offer more
than one, two or three years of instruction and only 34% of primary schools
provide all six grades, (b) the curriculum is not relevant to the natural
environments of the regions, (c) schools are unattractive and inadequately
equipped, (d) teaching is of poor quality, (e) children, mainly in the rural
areas, are compelled to help their family by going to work at an early age
and (f) in the case of girls, early marriage.
In accordance with accepted practice primary schools are normally
run in three shifts --morning (47%), afternoon (50%) and evening (3%). Stu-
dents at the evening schools are normalLy adolescents or children (9 to over
20 years) who are already working. Evening courses are not very effective
mainly because they attempt to cover the same curriculum as the day courses
in 50% of the time and because of the wide disparity in age and maturity of
the students. An additional obstacle is the frequent absence of the teachers.
The situation might improve if students over 15 years of age were not allowed
to enroll in the primary schools but encouraged to attend adult literacy pro-
grams or accelerated special courses.



APPENDIX I
Page 3
There were 16,054 teachers in primarv school education in 1970.
The percentage of qualified primary school teachers has improved rapidly,
having risen from 43.3% in 1961 to 79% in 1970.  The salary is very low and
there are irregularities in the system, (a) about 1,000 teaclhers are earn-
ing less than they should according to their category and (b) some are left
without payment for two or three months.
There are only 39 supervisors for the primary schools. This number
is low for 3,045 schools with more than 400,000 pupils enrolled. The primary
school supervisory system suffers from many deficiencies: (a) a shortage of
supervisors, most of whom are inadequately trained, (b) insufficient trans-
portation facilities aggravated by bad roads -- some of which are impassable
during rainy spells and (c) inadequate travel allowances. For these reasons
it is difficult to collect accurate information on education and to provide
guidance for the teachers on educational developments.
Paraguay's Ministry of Education has recognized the necessity for
improvement in primary education and has decided to permit some flexibility
in the primary school curriculum to adapt it to the particular needs of the
different regions.  New primary schools, teacher training schemes and rural
based teacher training programs are currently being sponsored by UNDP, UNESCQ,
UNICEF, USAID for broadening and updating elementary education curricula. A
USAID loan of US$4.2 million will finance the construction of 120 new primary
schools offering a full six year curriculum and will assist in the development
of new curriculum for primary education, development of textbooks and educa-
tional media and the supply of adequate teaching aids and materials. This
project might help reduce substantially the drop-out rate at primary
school level. UNESCO is providing some technical assistance for in-service
training programs for teachers and supervisors in primary education. UNICEF
has allocated US$222,000 since 1969 for basic sets of didactic materials,
motor vehicles for supervisors and hand tools for workshops to improve rural
primary schools and regional centers.
Regional Education Centers
Four regional education centers, distributed across the country,
offer primary education, lower cycle secondary education and upper cycle
secondary education in three majors: humanities - science, commerce and
primary teacher training. The total enrollment for the four centers in
1970 was 3,299 primary, 1,810 in lower cycle secondary education and 1,651
in upper cycle secondary education. The centers, staffed by full-time
teaclhers and administrators, have the necessary basic equipment, good lab-
oratories, teaching aids and materials. The regional centers are responsible
for guidanice and supervision of the primary schools in the surrounding areas.
Under a USAID loan US$1,280,000 has been allocated to construct
three new regional centers in the 1971-1974 period.



APPENDIX I
Page 4
Secondary Education
In its present form secondary education is not sufficiently respon-
sive to the country's economic needs due to the imbalance between academic
and technical education; the latter accounts for only 2% of the total enroll-
ment. New curricula for secondary education which are being prepared give
emphasis to science and practical activities (home economics, industrial
arts, agriculture, etc.) in the lower cycle and provides programs in human-
ities and sciences, commerce and technical fields in the upper cycle. Multi-
lateral schools are being planned to be set up in Asuncion and in the popu-
lated areas of the interior as a means of offering students adequate training
in fields related to their future employment and in an effort to prevent
students from migrating to urban areas. These schools will replace the many
small secondary schools which are now operating in small primary school build-
ings which are inadequate for secondary level teaching.
The basic data for public and private secondary schools in 1970 is
as follows:
(1)                (2)          (3)       (4)          (5)        (6)        (7)

There were 457 secondary schools in Paraguay in 1970 of which 131
were public (29%) with an enrollment of 26,909 students (48%). Most public
institutions on the secondary level charge 1,250 Guaranies (USS10) for enroll-
ment and examination fees. The boys/girls ratio attending school is 52:48.



APPENDIX I
Page 5
About 407. of the students enrolling in the first year of the secondary educa-
tion finish the six year course. The drop-out problem in secondary education
parallels that in the primary schools, i.e. poor quality of teaching, un-
attractive and inadequately equipped schools, children compelled to help
their families by going out to work and, in addition, a curriculum which is
not job oriented and not relevant to the natural environment of the regions.
Enrollment in lower cycle secondary education in 1970 was 38,172
students of whom 18,350 (48%) were in public schools. At this level, schools
are overcrowded and courses are being given in primary classrooms with i.-
adequate facilities. The 15:1 student/teacher ratio is too low at this level,
and should be raised to reduce the staff salary cost of the schools, thus
freeing resources for more teaching aids and equipment. At present no prac-
tical work is carried out in the school except at the four Regional Centers
in the rural areas where some industrial arts are included in the curric':tlm-
The upper cycle of the secondary education comprises courses for
(a) humanities and sciences, (b) commerce, (c) primary teacher training,
(d) technical and (e) agriculture. Annex 20 shows the distribution of er-
rollment of (a), (b) and (c) between 1963 and 1970.
Humanities and Sciences - at present the highest percentage of
students in the upper cycle are taking courses in humanities, the principel-
reason for this being that graduation from this source carries higher pres-
tige and provides a possibility of entry into the universities after a quali-
fying entrance examination. The enrollment of students taking up humanities
and sciences in 1970 was 10,783; this shows an average incremental enrollment
of 12.9% annually from 1963 (4,610); the annual output increment during the
same period was 17.7% giving a total of 2,488 graduates in 1970. No more
than 54% of the graduates from this program go into university, the others
are finding it increasingly difficult to find relevant jobs, in most cpses
due to lack of practical experience denied them by the almost non-existence
of laboratory workshop facilities in the secondary schools.
Commercial Education is oriented exclusively toward office adminis-
tration (secretarial work, some bookkeeping) but it is weak in economic and
commercial courses and accounting relevant to work in commerce, industry,
agriculture, banking, etc. The average annual increment in enrollment from
1963 (1,345) to 1970 (3,490) has been 14.6% and the average output increment
during the same period was 16.1%, giving a total of 636 leavers in 1970.
About 40% of this output is entering the universities. Of the 28 schools
offering commercial courses none are properly equipped. Six of these schools
are public with an enrollment of 1,890 students in 1970; the other 22 are
small schools where fees are high and the quality of teaching poor.
Primary Teacher Training - There are 40 schools offering teacher
training courses. The average annual increment in enrollment from 1963
(2,740) to 1970 (3,544) has been 3.8% and average output increment 2%.
Graduates in 1970 numbered 1,220.  This number is much in excess of



APPENDIX I
Page 6
yearly requirements of about 500 up to 1975 and about 600 by 1980. There
already exists a large number of primary school teacher graduates (about
4,000) who are unemployed or have been compelled to accept work outside of
the education system.
The Ministry of Education has embarked on a reform (a) controlling
the numbers trained to meet actual demand and (b) up-grading the quality of
primary school teachers. To accomplish this the Ministry has decided to
close all the public teacher training schools except eight. These will
eventually change from the present system of three-year secondary level
courses to two-year post-secondary courses. It is expected that with the
change in the level of teacher training programs the 19 existing private
teacher training schools will be forced to convert themselves to regular
secondary schools, or close down, since the Ministry plans to hire only
primary teachers who have had the two-year, post-secondary program by 1976.
Vocational Training at the lower secondary level is provided by
one public school in Asuncion, the "Escuela Tecnica Vocacional, Presidente
Carlos A. Lopez", and a number of private schools in Asuncion and the centers
of population in the interior. The total enrollment for 1970 was 1,044 and
the output 208 in various craft skills. The three-year program of the voca-
tional school "Presidente Carlos A. Lopez" offers courses in general mechanics,
auto mechanics, electricity, cabinet work, refrigeration, radio maintenance,
plumbing, leathercraft and graphic arts. The aim of this school is to train
semi-skilled workmen and it does not offer a high school diploma. Most of
the teachers at the "Presidente Carlos A. Lopez" School are employed on a
full-time basis but lack knowledge of and experience in effective technical/
vocational teaching.  There is no defined curricula for the courses and em-
phasis has been placed on academic subjects rather than on practical indus-
trial training; lack of adequate equipment in workshops has also led to poor
instruction in craft training.  Employers have revealed that the leavers from
this school do not meet the basic requirements for semi-skilled workmen.
Technical Education, at the upper secondary level, is at present
limited to evening courses in only one school, the "Escuela de Tecnicos Indus-
triales" (Industrial Technical School) in Asuncion which uses a primary school
building. This school offers building construction, electrical, mechanical
and industrial chemistry courses. The total enrollment in 1970 was 141 and
the number of graduates was 22 in all fi-elds. No records are kept as to the
placement of the graduates. Courses are being given in unsuitable classrooms,
with no workshop or laboratory facilities, and all instruction is given by
means of lectures. The majority of the teachers (68%) are unqualified and have
had little or no practical or pedagogical experience. They have spent a very
limited number of hours in this technical school.
In its present state the technical education and vocational training
system is, quantitatively and qualitatively, unable to meet the need for crafts-
men, particularly for middle level personnel. These students, after a period
of workshop experience, could become foremen and supervisors. Industry has
expressed a strong need for such staff, particularly in vocational training.

Following a seminar in "Planning of Secondary Technical and Voca-
tional Education" held in Asuncion in February 1971, organized by the Organi-
zation of American States, a number of international specialists in technical
education suggested a program for the improvement of this type of education.
The government has decided to take the following steps:
(a) Review the curriculum for the secondary technical schools
to enable graduates to go to work as skilled workmen or
to enter the higher educational institutions for further
specialized training.
(b) Establish a vocational program for pupils who have completed
the lower secondary cycle or who have dropped out of the
formal educational system.
(c) Establish a Department for vocational and technical education
development within the Ministry of Education.
(d) Establish a National Council with representation of industry
and the Ministry of Education to coordinate training programs
and output with respect to the country's manpower needs.
To implement the new technical/vocational program the government
will require a new technical secondary school with adequate equipment and
the improvement of facilities and programming of the existing vocational
school. In addition technical assistance and fellowships to improve the
quality of the technical teachers is required.
The government, in implementation of an agreement with the Ministry
of Labor of Spain, has established a Pilot Center for professional training
for adults. Equipment, amounting to about US$40,000, in addition to technical
assistance, has been contributed by the Spanish government. This Center, when
in full operation, will enable industry to upgrade its present labor force.
The National Administration of Electricity (ANDE), a semipublic utility com-
pany, also operates a school for the training of its employees in various
electrical fields. This school is receiving equipment and technical assis-
tance from the Electricite de France. In addition to these two adult train-
ing programs there are other programs under the control of public or private
agencies providing short, practical courses for craftsmen.
Agricultural Education and Training is provided at the lower second-
ary level by five regional agricultural education centers in the interior
under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture. Their aim is to produce
semi-skilled farm workers. Total enrollment in these schools is 150 and the
yearly output is 80. An IDB loan of US$1,133,200, supplemented by a Swiss
Government contribution of US$301,200, will finance the expansion of three
of these Centers and the construction of two additional ones. One school



APPENDIX I
Page 8
at the upper secondary level, the private "Escuela Carlos Pfannl" near Coro-
nel Oviedo, is devcted entirely to a high school program leading to an agri-
cultural diploma. The school enrolled 120 students in 1970 and will graduate
its first class in 1971. This school, operated by the Salesian Fathers, with
a loan from IDB of US$464,500 and a grant from the German government of
US$450,000, is improving its equipment and audio-visual aids.
Pre-vocational agriculture education is being developed in the
Regional Education Centers under the control of the Ministry of Education.
It is envisaged that agriculture courses in the upper cycle will be offered
by 1975.
Higher Education is provided at two autonomous universities, the
"Universidad Nacional de Asuncion" (public) and the "Universidad Catolica"
(private), and in-the "Institute Superior de Educacion" in Asuncion which is
directly under the control of the Ministry of Education. The total enroll-
ment in these institutions was 8,162 for 1970. The number of students finish-
ing the courses in that year was 734. Approximately 47% of the students are
enrolled in liberal and fine arts (law, political science, etc.), 22% in edu-
cation and philosophy, 13% in civil engineering and science, 12% in medical
science and 6% in agriculture (see Annex 5). Courses are from 3 to 5 years
duration and, subject to entrance examinations, are open to all students
holding the "baccalaureate" award at the end of the secondary school educa-
tion in humanities and science. Graduates from the primary teacher training
schools are allowed entry into the "Faculty of Philosophy" (School of Educa-
tion) and to the Higher Institute of Education. Graduates from commercial
schools can enter only the Faculty of Economic Science.
Female students account for 41% of enrollments. The number
of teachers in the three institutions of higher education amount to 946 which
gives a teacher/student ratio of 1:9. The Catholic University has branches
in the capital Asuncion and in Encarnacion, Villarica and Concepcion in the
interior of the country.
In addition to higher education provided in Paraguay, the Government
and some international agencies have given 118 fellowships in 1970 for study-
ing abroad. About 35% of these students went to Germany and France, 19% went
to Chile and Brazil and the remaining (46%) went to 11 other countries includ-
ing the U.S.A. The main streams of study taken abroad have been in education,
health and engineering.
Secondary Teacher Training is provided at the Higher Institute of
Education which comes under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and
in the two autonomous universities. The total enrollment in the teacher
training program in the three higher establishments (including the Institute
of Basic Sciences) was 1,901 in 1970. The output for the same year was 260.



APPENDIX I

The quality of teachers produced by these schools is low, espec-
ially in the pedagogical aspects. University authorities are preparing plans
for the general improvement of teacher training education.
The Higher Institute of Education, receiving technical assistance
from UNESCO, is responsible for (a) training teachers for the lower second-
ary cycle, (b) training teachers in industrial arts, (c) training supervisors
and administrators for secondary schools, (d) maintaining programs for the
upgrading of secondary teachers through in-service courses and (e) pedagogic-
al research aimed at the improvement of education. By 1973 the Institute
will start training teachers in a wider range of fields, including practical
subjects, for the upper level secondary technical school and for the voca-
tional centers.
Teacher training in physics, chemistry, mathematics and biology
for upper level secondary schools is being done in the Institute of Basic
Sciences of the National University. This institute is well equipped and
is receiving assistance from UNDP Special Fund (US$1.1 million). The Govern-
ment is also sending teachers abroad for up-grading in technical orientation
and is attempting to expand this program by requesting fellowships from in-
ternational agencies. A new salary structure for secondary school teachers
on a full-time basis is being prepared by the Government to attract the
graduates of the Higher Institutes to these posts.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.        New curricula, now developed, have been designed to meet the
changing requirements in the fields of agriculture, commercial, industrial
arts and technical subjects. To implement these reforms, the government,
although already receiving technical assistance from a number of agencies
(Annex 12), would require technical assistance for the new technical
school and the technical streams for the multilateral schools in the rural
areas.
2.        In order to ensure that all the technical assistance required for
the project is provided, specialists would be obtained either (a) through
assistance already being offered by international bodies or (b) through tech-
nical assistance to be provided by the project. A total of 33 man-years of
specialist services and 23 man-years of fellowships for overseas training are
the minimum requirements for achieving required objectives and would be in-
cluded in the project.
3.        The total cost of technical assistance to be provided under the
project is estimated at US$830,000 for the specialists and US$150,000 for
fellowships.  The implementation and disbursements for technical assistance
and fellowships would be over 6 years (Annex 18).
4.        The total assistance to be provided under the project would con-
sist of the following specialists and fellows:

5.        The specialist in Organization and Administration should be a profes-
sional engineer or other technologist with broad experience in organization
and administration in a technical institute. He would work in close liaison
with the Director of Education and heads of the different project schools and
would coordinate the work of all the other international experts and counter-
parts (provided by the government).
6.        The architect consultant and the procurement specialist would assist
the project unit, within the Ministry of Education, in developing briefs and
standards and procurement of furniture and equipment for the project schools.
7.        The other 8 specialists should be experts in their own fields pref-
erably with long experience in technical/vocational training. They would ad-
vise counterparts in the setting up of syllabus and program arrangements, in
the supervision of practical training, preparation of laboratory and workshop
schemes, and whenever possible, in the supervision of installation of equip-
ment.
8.        All the experts except the architect consultant and procurement
specialist would be based in the new technical school but would be responsi-
ble for supervision of the technical streams of the multilateral schools of
the project.
9.        All experts and fellows recruited under the Credit would be mutually
acceptable to the government and the Association. The government has indica-
ted that the main source for recruitment for the technical assistance would
be Latin American Countries, particularly Argentina, Chile and Brazil.
