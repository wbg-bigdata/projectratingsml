PREFACE
1.       This repcrt presents an evaluation of the results achieved under the
Bank's Fifth Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP)
Project. The US$30.0 million loan in support of industrial sector objectives
was made to PDCP to support PDCP's program of lending for economically
desirable and financially viable enterprises, mainly in manufacturing. The
loan was appraised in August 1977, approved by the Board in January 1978 and
signed in February 1978. The loan became effective in June 1978.
2.       The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Bank's
Industry and Energy Operations Division, Country Department II, Asia Regional
Office.  The PCR draws on the Staff Appraisal and President's Reports, loan
documents and the project files. It presents a factual review of the opera-
tions of the project, the extent to which the main objectives were achieved
and the results of the investments made. A draft PCR, which included a sub-
stantial data base on project performance and status, was received from the
Borrower.
3.       This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department COED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments, and they are attached to
the Report (Annex 22).

PROJECT CQMPLETION REPORT
PH, PPTlES
FIFTH PRIVATE DEVBLOPENBM CORPORATION OF TEE PHILIPPINES PROJECT
(LOAN 1514-PH)
EVALUATION SUHHAMY
1.    Loan 1514-PH, the fifth loan made to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) aimed at providing term finance to
et-.nomically desirable and financially viable industrial enterprises,
especially in manufacturing (para 2.1).
2.    Fund utilization of the loan was satisfactory:  with funds disbursed
to 28 subDrojects (one was cancelled), the objective of helping PDCP
finance industrial enterprises was achieved (paras. 3.1-3.3). The project
was alao successful in generating employment, foreign exchange
earnings/savings and value added that compared favorably with what was
projected (para. 3.9).
3.    Unfortunately, because of the depressed economic conditions that
characterired the Philippines during 1983 to 1986, the operational
performance of the subprojects was mixed in terms of sales and
substantially below appraisal expectations as regards financial and
economic rates of return (paras 3.6-3.7). Massive peso devaluations during
that period compounded the problems of the subborrowers by increasing their
debt service obligations which were denominated in foreign currency. This
led to a high level of arrears which in turn contributed to PDCP's
incurring losses (para. 3.11). Given the severity of the economic crisis
and accompanying large devaluations, it is remarkable that the subprojects
financed under Loan 1514-PH did not perform worse than what the actual
results show.
4.    As for PDCP itself, with most of its loan portfolio denominated in
foreign currency, the magnitude of its bad and doubtful debts and the
shortfall, in foreign currency terms, of collections and collateral assets
reached such a level as to erode substantially its capital base,
profitability and liquidity (paras 5.9-S.11). Despite high standards in
project appraisal and reforms in project supervision to enable more
effective response to subborrowers' increasing inability to meet their
obligations (paras 4.3-4.6), PDCP was saddled with a loan portfolio marked
by low collection levels, high arrears ratios and deficiencies in
collateral values (paras. 5.13-5.14). The accompanying write-offs and loss
provisions coupled with the decline in profitability led to the gradual
shrinkage of its equity, with its high leverage suggesting the need for a
substantial injection of new capital.
5.    PDCP's poor financial performance mirrored its inadequate operational
performance, itself a reflection of the general deterioration of the
economy. Loan volume as well as equity investments declined (paras 5.2-
5.6). Its domestic resource mobilization efforts were hampered by the



- vi -
limited capital market, escalating interest rates and restrictions on its
taking deposits from the public (para. 5.17). As for foreign funds, the
reluctance of subborrowers to assume the foreign exchange risk following
the peso devaluations dissuaded PDCP from borrowing foreign currency since
1983 (paras. 5.14-5.20).
6.    To cope with its problems, PDCP took the following measures in the
last four years:
(a)   To improve liquidity adversely affected by decreasing
collections, it undertook a rehabilitation plan involving cash
support from Far East Bank and the Government (para. 5.18).
This, however, provided only a short-term solution enabling
PDCP to meet its amortization payments on IBRD and African
Development Bank (ADB) loans;
(b)   To reduce the impact of foreign exchange movements on its
subborrowers an4 itself, it proposed possible solutions to the
Government, notably a redenomination (or conversion) of its
multiple-currency loans into single-currency (dollar) loans.
This would involve the Government assuming the cross-currency
foreign exchange risk and the subborrowers bearing the exchange
risk on the dollar (para. 7.3). The Bank supported this
request but the Government has not yet responded.
7.    More important is the need for PDCP to articulate a longer term
strategy that takes into account the now changed financial system where
PDCP no longer enjoys a quasi-monopoly, with the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP), of access to foreign exchange funds. This entails
identification of its comparative advantage in a more competitive
environment where other financial institutions also can tap long term funds
such as the Industrial Guarantee Loan Fund (IGLF) and Agricultural Loan
Fund (ALF). A strategic framework wherein investment banking would have
synergistic linkages with what has been PDCP's acknowledged area of
expertise, namely project finance, appears to offer possibilities.
Recognizing this, PDCP has resumed its investment house activities and is
expanding its mutual fund operations. Nonetheless, this new strategic
orientation will require a sound financial base to help its investment
banking business grow to the required "critical mass' (paras 7.5-7.6).
8.    Experience in executing the project suggests the following lessons:
(i)   PDCP is directly and profoundly affected by changes in its
environment over which it has no control. As its subborrowers assumed the
foreign exchange risk, they suffered heavy losses as a result of the major
devaluations from 1983 to 1986. This led to severe repayment problems
which were translated into high arrears and low collection levels for PDCP,
thus undermining the institution's financial position.
(ii) In retrospect, it is clear that it is difficult for private
enterprises which do not earn foreign exchange to bear the foreign exchange
risk. In an environment of market-oriented domestic interest rates and
free capital movements, a better approach would be for the government to
assume the foreign exchange risk for a market-related fee.



- vii -
(Ili) At the tiLe of appraising Loan 1514-PB, emphasis was placed on
the mobilization of commercial foreign currency resources but not on
domestic resource mobilization by PDCP. Excessive reliance on forei8n
currency funds on the liability side and foreign currency loans on the
asset side contributed significantly to PDCP's losses and poor performance.
In the future, more effort should be spent on addressing constraints on
domestic resource mobilization such as limited capital markets, and
implementation of strategies for raising funds in the domestic market.



PROJECT COMPLITION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
FIFTH PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF TEM PHILIPPINES PROJECT
(LOAN   1514-PH)  __,,_,._____________
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      Heavily dependent on imports and foreign capital, the Philippine
economy did not adjust well to the severe external shocks of the post-1979
period--high oil prices and interest rates, and declining export prices. The
economy.experienced declining growth rates, a deteriorating balance of
payments, and the accumulat4on of a large external debt. The period was also
marked by a money market crisis iii 1981, followed by economic contraction from
1983 until the end of 1985, during which time inflation surged. This period
was characterized by an active monetary and exchange rate policy, with large
devaluations and extremely high nominal interest rates. It should also be
noted that a political crisis in 1983, combined with a world-wide debt crisis,
led to a cessation of foreign credits, and forced the Government to embark on
a major stabilization effort. The most recent phase, starting in 1986, and
still continuing, is one of gradual economic recovery, supported by an IMF
Standby Arrangement in 1986 and an Economic Recovery Loan approved by the IBRD
Board in March 1987. The economic decline has been reverseds GDP grew by 1.5t
in 1986, 4.72 in 1987 and 6.6? in 1988.
1.2      The Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) was
established in 1963 with the active support and financial assistance of the
Bank and IFC in response to the Government's desire for a privately owned and
managed development finance institution. PDCP's main objectives were and
continue to be: assist in the creation, expansion and modernization of private
production enterprises in the Philippines; encourage private capital
participation in enterprises from local and foreign sources; and develop local
technical, financial and managerial capabilities. To help accomplish these
aims, PDCP's Articles of Incorporation empower it to extend medium and long
term loans, invest in equity capital, underwrite or take up equity and debt
security issues, guarantee loans and provide rumagerial and technical
assistance to its borrowers. A list of shareholders as of December 31, 1987
is provided in Annex 1. PDCP's initial share capital in 1963 of P 25.0
million has been periodically increased and as of December 31, 1987, paid up
capital amounted to P 110.0 million. IFC which subscribed P 800,000 of PDCP's
initial capital stock sold its shares at a profit in 1987.
1.3      The Bank has continued its association with PDCP by supporting it
with five loans totalling US$125 million: Ln. 0331-PH approved in 1962; Ln.
0467-PH approved in 1966; Ln. 0630-PH approved in 1969; Ln. 1052-PH approved
in 1974 and Ln. 1514-PH approved in 1978. The last loan is the subject of
this Project Completion Report.



II. PROJECT OBJRCTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
Objectives
2.1      The objective of the project was to support PDCP's program of lending
for economically desirable and financially viable enterprises, mainly in
manufacturing. A special feature of the loan was its use as a catalyst for
the mobilization of complementary external medium term funds from private
financial institutions. More specifically, PDCP secured a loan of US$10
million from the Bank of Tokyo simultaneously and in conjunction with the Bank
loan.
Description
2.2      As with the four previous loans to PDCP, Loan 1514-PH was made to the
Philippine National Bank (PNB) because by virtue of Philippine law, the
Government can only guarantee the obligations of government institutions. PNB
then channelled the loan to PDCP for a service fee of 0.75? p.a. on the
outstanding loan amount.
2.3      The loan proceeds were to be used to finance the foreign exchange
needs of PDCP's subprojects. Disbursements wonld normally be to finance 100?
of foreign currency expenditures for direct imports. PDCP could also use the
proceeds for financing indirect imports, i.e. the foreign exchange component
in off-the-shelf purchases of machinery and equipment. The maturity of
subloans was to range from five to twelve years, with a maximum grace period
of five years. When the project was approved, PDCP was expected to charge
interest rates of 12.5? to 14? for its foreign currency loans, with the
subborrowers assuming the foreign exchange risk. This would provide PDCP with
a maximum gross spread of 52 on IBRD funds. As in the case of the fourth PDCP
Loan, there was a limit of US$2.5 million on the maximum size of each subloan.
2.4      The project was appraised in August 1977 and approved by the Board on
January 31, 1978. The Loan Agreement was signed on February 9, 1978 and the
loan became effective on June 23, 1978.
III. UTILIZATION OF THE BANK LOAN
3.1      Rate of Utilization.  The project was successful in disbursing funds
to industrial enterprises. The loan was utilized over a five year period --
1979 up to the first quarter of 1984--with the bulk disbursed by the end of
the third year. Though the original closing date of March 31, 1982 had to be
extended twice, to March 31, 1984 in order to allow full utilization of the
loan, the rate of utilization was much faster than that of the prior PDCP Loan
(1052-PH) because of more favorable economic conditions during the initial
years of disbursement and the larger average loan size. Details on the rate
of disbursement for Loan 1514-PH are in Annex 2.

La Actual figure based on 18 projects for which data were available;
estimates based on 23 projects.
3.3      As evident from Annex 3, Loan 1514-PH was used to finance 29
subprojects. The average loan size was $1,011,104 and the average unweighted
term of the loans was 10.35 years while the weighted average was 7.37 years.
Expansion/modernization projects accounted for the major portion of PDCP's
Loan 1514-PH. Compared with the previous TBRD Loan 1052-PH, IBRD's share in
total project cost declined from 342 to 102 due to the increased funding of
projects from otter local and foreign sources.
3.4      Cost Overruns.  A comparison of actual and estimated project costs
(Annex 4) indicates that overall there was a cost overrun of 4.8Z. Further
breakdown of the data reveals that there were 19 subprojects (73? of the
total) with cost overruns ranging from .04Z to 43.62 and seven subprojects
with cost savings from 0.2X to 29.32. One project was discontinued. The cost
overruns were due primarily to increased equipment costs arising from price
increases and foreign exchange differentials, as well as costs attributed to
changes in design, specifications, or layout.
3.5      Proiect Completion.  As regards timeliness of actual project
implementation (Annex 4), one project was completed ahead of schedule, three
were on time, while the majority (22 representing 79? of the total) were
delayed by periods ranging from 2 to 28 months. The delays were caused mostly



- 4 -
by project modifications such as changes in the equipment type/design or
supplier. Problems related to clients' compliance with the disbursement
documentation requirements also caused some delays.
3.6      Operating and Financial Performance.  PDCP's decisions to finance the
subprojects were taken between 1979-1981, a period when economic conditions in
the Philippines were good. The operating and financial performance of the
subprojects, as depicted in Annex 6, reflects the depressed economic
conditions encountered subsequently, following the economic downturn that
started in 1983. Aggregate sales figures indicate that performance was
consistently below expectations and reveal stagnation between the third and
fourth year followed by a significant decline between the fourth and fifth
year. At a disaggregated level, however, the record was mixed, with the
number of subprojects performing better than projected ranging from 6 to 14 in
each year and averaging 10 during the first five years of commercial
operations; the corresponding numbers for subprojects performing worse than
expected were 7 to 15, averaging 12. As regards profitability during the
first five years of operations, the number of enterprises showing positive
profits has remained fairly constant each year, ranging from 14 to 15, with
those showing losses numbering between 11 and 12. Earnings as a percentage of
average net worth was below 102 for most of the profitable subprojects, with
only 4 or 5 consistently earning above 102.
3.7      As a result of the deteriorating economic environment, actual
financial results were considerably below appraisal estimates. Weighted
average financial rates of return (FRR) for the subprojects was only 7.82, as
compared with the estimated 17.32 FRR at the time of subproject appraisal.
Seventy-nine percent of the projects generated PRR; the rest generated
negative returns or losses.
3.8      Economic Performance.  Of the 28 subprojects, 23 yielded positive
economic returns while the rest generated negative returns. The subprojects,
actual weighted average economic rate of return (ERR) was 12.41, substantially
lower than the estimated weighted average ERR of 22.12 but still laud -le in
view of the severe economic problems facing the country during the project
implementation period.
3.9      The goals of the project as regards employment, foreign exchange
earnings and value-added were achieved. On the basis of data for 18
subprojects on which data were available, a total of 3,302 jobs were created,
at an average investment cost per job of P 20.1 million; this compares
favorably with projections of 4,286 jobs for 23 subprojects at an average
investment cost of P 19.5 million. PDCP estimates that the subprojects
financed through Loan 1514 earn around $20 million of foreign exchange
annually. Value-added for 23 subprojects with available data amounted to
P 432.0 million compared to an estimated level of P 419.0 million for 25
subprojects. Detailed data on the economic performance of subprojects are
presented in Annex 7.
Effective Cost of Bank Funds to Subborrowers
3.10     With the subborrowers bearing the foreign exchange risk, the
devaluations of the peso from 1983-1986 significantly increased their



borrowing costs. Taking into account the adverse exchange rate movements and
using a discounted cash flow analysis (Annex 8), the effective cost of Loan
1514 funds to subborrowers was estimated by PDCP to be 34.42 in 1987. This
represents a financing cost substantially higher than the weighted average FRR
of 8? on the profitable projects.   This high cost made it difficult for many
of the borrowers to service their obligations during the 1982-86 period and
led to a number of restructurings and reschedulings of the accounts. The
subborrowers' increased debt servicing requirements arose from the rapid
deterioration of the peso against the US dollar, yen, DM and Swiss Francs the
magnitude involved can be gauged from the fact that by 1987 the dollar had
appreciated to 2.5 times its value in peso terms relative to 1981 and the yen
had increased to 4.5 times its value in peso terms in the same period. The
only clients able to weather these difficulties were those with a relatively
low debt-equity structure, those able to maintain or increase their sales and
profit levels, or those with substantial export earnings.
3.11     Quality of Subloan Portfolio.  The arrears in the subloan portfolio
show the commulative impact of the foreign exchange losses and the downturn in
the economy. Total loans outstanding in respect of the 28 projects amounted
to P 347.9 million as of September 30, 1988 (see Annex 9). Of these, 13 were
in current status and 15 were in arrears of more than three months. Eleven
loans had been rescheduled of which seven were again past due.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
4.1      Management/Ornanization.  In 1986, PDCP underwent significant changes
in its capital structure (see para. 5.7) and implemented a reorganization
which involved formation of a new Board of Directors and the establishment of
an Advisory Board to provide guidance and direction to senior management.
PDCP's Board of Directors now consists of 11 members, four of whom are
incumbent PDCP officers representing the PDCP Provident Fund, the main
shareholder. PDCP's senior management consists of the Chairman, President and
Treasurer, with the President being effectively the Chief Executive Officer.
In an effort to decentralize and strengthen middle management, 6 Vice
Presidents and 6 Assistant Vice Presidents head the operations of the 15
departments which form 3 groups: Operations, Project Management, and
Administration/Accounting/Finance.
4.2      Staffing.  Since PDCP's professional staff is an important resource,
its high turnover rate over the years is alarming: from 292 in 1974, the rate
went down to 13? in 1978, but rose again to 24Z by 1986 following the "freeze
hire' policy instituted in 1983. Average annual turnover among professionals
during 1979-88 was 18t. The turnover can be attributed to the strong demand
for PDCP-trained professionals from other financial institutions offering
higher financial emoluments and better perceived security of employment.
Nonetheless, such turnover adversely affects the morale of remaining staff,
undermines continuity, drains orientation and training resources, and makes it
more difficult for PDCP to develop the organizational cohesion necessary for
effective implementation of strategy.   PDCP's upgrading of its managerial and
non-managerial salary structure in January 1987 did not enhance its
competitiveness as expectedt the professional turnover rate was 19.8X and
25.61 in 1987 and 1988 respectively.



-6-
Standards and Procedures
4.3      Proiect Appraisal.  PDCP's appraisal procedures are sound.  Criteria
related to fitancial, market, technical, managerial and economic viability are
applied, including the adequacy of financial and economic rates of returns on
investment. Various improvements, however, are being implemented in PDCP's
project appraisal in light of PDCP's past experience. The most notable new
feature is the inclusion of competitive analysis, which involves examination
of project proposals in the context of likely strategic countermoves by
competitors within the industry, and maturity of the product line(s).
4.4      Proiect Supervision.  PDCP's many attempts at improving project
supervision failed to stem the deterioration in the arrears situation which
vas due to more basic forces at work - the economic crises coupled with the
continuing depreciation of the peso. Following the Bank's emphasis during
supervision missions on the need to strengthen the staffing and management of
the Project Management Group (PMG), which was in charge of project
supervision, changes in project supervision were initiated in early 1983s
specialized units were formed out of the existing supervision group. The
Special Projects Department (SPD) was organized to handle problem projects and
the Acquired Assets Unit (AMU) was formed to take on the responsibility for
disposing assets foreclosed by or conveyed to PDCP in partial or full payment
of loan obligations. The balance of the portfolio was handled by the Project
Monitoring and Supervision Department (PMSD). SPD, during its 3-year
existence, formulated and implemented rehabilitation plans for problem
projects and initiated legal action vhere necessary. AAtD took on the function
of liquefying the acquired assets and attending to the logistical requirements
for administration, maintenance, repair, and upkeap of the assets to avoid
asset deterioration and at the same time accelerate recoveries.
4.5      In 1985, a Bank Mission reviewing project supervision Dy SPD found
that its 'analysis did not delve into the depth and analytical assessments
normally considered necessary to justify rescheduling actions given the
deteriorating economic conditions,' and concluded that projections made at the
time of loan reschedulings were overly optimistic.
4.6      By mid-1986, after the rehabilitation plans for the problem accounts
had been developed and implemented and considering the reduced level of its
lending operation and the need to consolidate its manpower resources, PDCP
again decided to merge PMSD and SPD into one, reverting to the original set
up. The rationale for this action was the need for the institutional
structure for supervision to be relatively flexible, adjusting to the
requirements of particular situations.
V. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF PDCP
Operational Performance
5.1      As one might expect under the adverse economic conditions, PDCP'a
operational and financial performance in the eighties was lackluster.



-7
Declining loan volume, unimpressive syndications and underwriting operntions
and reduction of its equity portfolio were accompanied by a shrinking equity
base, vanishing liquidity and decreased profitability. A loan portfolio
marked by high arrears and collateral deficiencies led to increased loan loss
provisions which undermined PDCP's financial position. The large extent to
which foreign exchange losses contributed to these arrears and, thus, to
PDCP's financial predicament calls for a reassessment of the policy whereby
subborrowers were made to assume the foreign exchange risk.
5.2      Overall Loan Operations.  As evident in Annex 10, PDCP met the
overall targetted approvals for the years 1978-79, exceeding them in 1980 with
the highest level in its history of P 1.3 billion. After 1980 however, there
was a sharp drop in approvals in most lending categories, particularly foreign
currency lending due, initially, to the unfavorable economic conditions and,
later on, increasing aversion of enterprises to bear the foreign exchange risk
as tki peso began to decline steadily.
5.3      PDCP's lending operations for the 1982-87 period are detailed in
Annex 11. Approvals continued to decline in the period from P 418.0 million
in 1982 to P 261.9 million in 1986, except for a temporary increase to P 736.3
million in 1984 due to the peso-denominated loans made available through the
Central Bank/IBRD Apex Fund (Loan 1984-PH) with the foreign exchange risk
being shouldered by the Central Bank. In 1987, approvals amounted to P 406.9
million, largely accounted for by external fund management activities and peso
lending funded through the Industrial Guarantee Loan Fund (IGLF) and Guarantee
Fund For Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (GFSHE). More availments from
IGLF may be limited as PDCP already accounts for 25? of IGLF lending and as
IGLF could limit available credit to 150? of PDCP's equity.
5.4      Foreign currency lending has almost disappeared as a PDCP product
line. In 1987, only 27S of total approvals were in foreign currency, compared
to a previous high of 92? in 1976 and 65? in 1977. During the first quarter
of 1988, no foreign currency loans were approved. Although the Bank has been
discouraging PDCP from an excessive reliance on foreign currency lending since
1976, the decline in foreign currency denominated loans has unfortunately not
been offset by increased local currency lending.
5.5      Syndications and Underwriting Operations.  To complement its direct
lending activities and assist viable clients with large financial requirements
without violating its prescribed single borrower limits, PDCP also provides
loan syndications and underwriting services, thus helping mobilize additional
financial resources for its clients. PDCP's syndications and underwriting
operations, which reached P 160.7 million in 1986 and P85 million in 1987, are
not characterized by any pattern owing to shifts in economic conditions.
5.6      Equity Investments.  In the seventies, PDCP invested in enterprises
in line with its goals of becoming more active in equity investment operations
and helping develop a secondary market for the issues it intended to
underwrite. However, in more recent years, PDCP has followed a strategy of
unloading its equity investments: as of December 1987, its equity investments
(Annex 12) in 15 companies including those in its eight subsidiaries, amounted
to P 15.9 million at acquisition cost, a substantial decline from the P 28.4
million level as of December, 1986. Estimated realizable value of the



-8-
investments amounted to P 13.7 million, thus showing a potential net capital
loss of about P 2.8 million as against the portfolio carv.ying value of P 16.5
million. Portfolio impairment was due partly to write-downs of PDCP's
investment of about P 2.1 million in a bank and a securities broker.
5.7      Guarantee Operations.  Given the minor role of guarantee operations
in PDCP's strategy, marketing efforts were not directed at actively seeking
out this business. Consequently, PDCP's guarantee operations (Anner 13) have
been erratic, reaching a peak of P 68.7 million in 1979, then tapering off to
zero starting 1983. These guarantees, which supplemented PDCP's direct
lending, were issued against suppliers' credits or peso loans of local
financial institutions.
Financial Performance
5.8      Changes in Shareholder Structure.  In May 1981 PDCP's stockholders
approved a stock swap with Par East Bank and Trust Company (Far East Bank)
through which the latter became the major shareholder (87Z) in PDCP. This has
had its advantages and disadvantages: (a) the association with Far East Bank,
a prominent and profitable commercial bank, has htlped maintain depositors'
confidence in PDCP; (b) PDCP gained the ability to offer a full-service
financing package with Par East Sank supplying short-term working capital
funds; but (c) on the other hand, legal restrictions on Far East Bank
investing more than 152 of its net worth in PDCP prevented it from supplying
the needed cash equity to PDCP. In October 1986, Far East Bank sold its
equity holdings in PDCP to the PDCP Provident Fund, ostensibly to enable Far
East Bank to pursue its universal banking strategy and allow PDCP freedom tc
focus on its role as a development finance institution. A likely motive force
behind the divestment by Far East may well have been the apprehension caused
by the increased debt servicing requirements of PDCP following the successive
devaluations of the peso.
5.9      Equity and Capital Structure.  PDCP's audited balance sheets for the
years 1978-87 are presented in Annex 14. From a high of P 207 million in 1985
PDCP's equity base has shrunk to P 143.2 million in June 1988 because of
write-offs and provisions (para. 5.15) which exceeded its modest profits.
After remaining within the covenanted 8:1 limit from 1978-82, the long-term
debt/equity ratio rose above the limit in 1983-85 as a result of the peso
depreciation vis-a-vis the dollar.   In 1984, PDCP requested a loosening of
the convenanted 8:1 long-term debt/equity ratio but the Bank disagreed,
recommending that PDCP seek additional equity funding from its majority
stockholder, Par East Bank. PDCP's efforts to raise additional equity capital
from Far East as well as IFC and ADB failed. Its gearing improved in 1986
when, with the infusion of the P 150.0 million Far East Bank subordinated loan
and the Monetary Board's approval of its treatment as quasi-equity, the long-
term debt/equity ratio fell to 7.3:l. However, as a result of a P 65 million
net loss incurred in 1987 (para. 5,.ll) which adversely affected PDCP's capital
structure, the ratio deteriorated again to 9.0:1. There was some improvement
in 1988 following the P2.1 million net income realized during the first
semester of 1988s the long-term debt/equity ratio fell to 8.18sl, though still
marginally above the covenanted limit. The high leverage suggests the need
for a substantial infusion of equity capital.



-9-
5.10     Liquidity.  In conformity with an IFC Loan Agreement, PDCP's net
liquid assets as a percentage of total assets (net liquidity ratio) exceeded
the covenanted 42 in the years 1982 and 1986 but failed to remain above that
minimum in the years 1983-85, an indication of PDCP's financial difficulties
in those years. The minimum current liquidity ratio of 1.15tl agreed under
Loan 1514-PR was met only in 1986. Both liquidity ratios were below the
covenanted limits in December 1987, indicating an acute liquidity problem.
The situation has improved, however, in 1988 as a result of its profitable
operations during the first semester of 1988: the current liquidity and net
liquidity ratios of 1.34:1 and 12.141 as of June 30, 1988 were both above the
minimum limits of 1.15:1 and 4.02 respectively.   Details of the pertinent
financial statements and ratios are in Annexes 14 and 17.
5.11     Profitability.  PDCP's performance during the period of project
implementation was characterized by declining profitability. Net income
decreased from P 22 million in 1978 (182 of gross income) to P 3 million in
1986 (12 of gross income). In 1987, for the first time in 24 years, PDCP
suffered a P 65 million net loss, principally because of substantial
provisions for possible losses on loans in foreign exchange. Financial
expenses ranged from 74t to 602 of gross income from 1982-86 and posted their
highest level of 1052 in 1987, due in part to the cost of short-term
borrowings which was not adequately offset by interest income from PDCP's
short-term lendings. Details are in Annexes 15-16.
5.12     Profitability after tax as a percentage of average equity has also
declined. From an average of 162 irn 1975-1980, it fell to 9.52 in 1981.
Subsequently, the figures for 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 have been,
respectively, 5.42, 2.9X, 2.32, 1.32, and 1.5. Return on average net worth
for the first six months of 1988 was 1.48X.
5.13     Quality of Portfolio.  The quality of its loan portfolio, assessed by
collections and arrears levels as well as deficiencies in collateral values,
remains a major concern for PDCP. In the period 1979-87, PDCP's cash
collection ratio (percentage of principal and interest due actually collected)
has hovered between 60 and 702, (see Annex 18), a low level that indicates a
cash flow problem and raises doubts about PDCP's viability. Its cash
collection performance is even bleaker with regard to past due principal and
interest, ranging from 232 to 48Z in 1986 and 1987. PDCP's poor collection
performance has affected PDCP's liquidity position. With the inadequate
collections, total loan arrears as a percentage of principal outstanding
remained rather high, staying between 82 and 92 during most of 1978-1987
(Annex 19) and shooting up to 14t as of June 30, 1988. As regards principal
affected by arrears as a percentage of total principal outstanding, the
figures have remained high: an increase from 252 in 1978 to 392 in 1980; a
decline in 1981, 1982 and 1983 only to be followed by increases to 36Z in
1985, 422 in 1986, then down to 342 in 1987. (Annex 19). If the arrears taken
into consideration are limited to those over three months, the same basic
trends are discernible. The apparent improvement in 1987 may be due to
reschedulings and the transfer of several past due and non-performing accounts
to Far East Bank.



- 10 -
5.14     There is also a gap between the peso value of loan collateral and the
rising value in peso terms of the foreign currency obligations secured by the
collateral. Total collateral deficiencies resulting from the peso
depreciation, estimated at P 368 million as of May 31, 1988, decrease the
quality of PDCP's portfolio and lead to foreclosure losses.
5.15     Provisions.  Provisions for doubtful accounts amounted to P 93.5
million on June 30, 1988 or 30.42 of total arrears and 4.31 of total loan
portfolio. As of December 1987, PDCP's external auditors had determined that
the provisions were inadequate and required an additional allowance for
doubtful accounts of P 79 million. The Central Bank, however, allowed PDCP
to spread the additional provisions necessary over a 5 year period at the
rate of P 1.3 millionM per month starting January 1988. Had this additional
provision been booked in 1987, PDCP would have posted a net loss of P 144
million.
5.16     PDCP's financial performance, as depicted in paras. 5.9 to 5.15 shows
that it suffered as a result of macro-economic developments beyond its
control. The foreign exchange losses borne by its subborrowers contributed
significantly to PDCP's arrears, low collections and, ultimately, poor
financial results. With the benefit of hindsight, one may conclude that, by
and large, subborrowers are in no position to assume the foreign exchange
risk. Mechanisms have to be found for the government to bear the foreign
exchange risk for a market related fee.
Resource Mobilization
5.17     Domestic Currency.  Classified as a Non-Bank Quasi-Bank under Central
Bank regulations, PDCP is not allowed to accept retail deposits, an important
potential source of local funds. It is allowed to tap institutional
investors. However, some financing sources have either been inappropriate
(e.g. the short term money market) or they have been difficult to attract
(e.g. private placements from institutional lenders, as these could earn
higher returns elsewhere, for only a 3light increase in perceived risk). The
total amount of P323.1 million raised in the 1978-1987 period (Annex 20) were
principally back-to-back deposits by PDCP's own borrowers, as cash collateral.
Moreover, the lack of a developed capital market has prevented it from
mobilizing domestic term funds through the issuance of bonds, even though it
has SEC authorization to issue its own long term commercial paper up to a
maximum of P 300 million.  PDCP's domestic resource mobilization efforts were
also impeded by the political and economic crisis which burdened the financial
markets with prohibitive interest rates and very limited credit resources. As
a consequence, PDCP has faced shortages of term peso resources.
5.18     A financial assistance package obtained from Far East Bank in 1986
and complemented by a parallel assistance agreement with the National
Government did not constitute normal mobilization of domestic funds as it was
designed mainly to bridge major shortfalls in PDCP's cash collections from
borrowers and enable PDCP to retire short term obligations and meet its debt
service obligations. The package, amounting to P 280.0 million, payable in
tranches and completely remitted to PDCP by May 1988, consisted of the
following: (1) Subordinated Loan from Far East Bank of P 150.0 million; (2)



- 11 -
Assignment to Far East Bank, without recourse, of restructured and past due
receivables for P 127.1 million; and (3) Purchase by Par East Bank of
residential condominium and PDCP'V board seat at the Manila Stock Exchange for
P 2.9 million. The Subordinated Loan carried soft temsss maturity of up to
10 years with 5 years grace on principal; 1S p.a. interest during the first 3
years, 122 p.a. interest the fourth year, 15Z p.a. the fifth year and market
rates thereafter. Far East Bank also agreed to waive PDCP's repayment
obligations if and when such repayment would violate PDCP's covenanted
financial ratios with its creditors and bring its debt service cover below the
lsl level. As part of its latest rehabilitation strategy, PDCP is seeking to
soften further and stretch out these terms.
5.19     Foreign Currency.  Since the time PDCP availed of Loan 1514-PH, it
secured three other foreign currency loans to fund its lending requirements
(Annex 21); the Bank of Tokyo. $10.0 million cofinancing for Loan 1514-PH,
secured in 1978; the Commonwealth Development Corporation, Pounds sterling 9.5
million in 1979; and ADB ($45.0 million in 1983). It also availed of US$39.1
million under the IBRDICB Industrial Finance Project (Apex) as a participating
financial institution. Owing to business uncertainties and the sharp
devaluation of the peso during the period, the ADB loan had few takers and 94Z
of it was eventually cancelled. Given the increasing reluctance of business
enterprises to incur foreign currency obligations in view of peso devaluations
and PDCP's problems of arrears, reschedulings and inadequate asset realization
arising from these devaluations, PDCP has not sought additional foreign
credit lines since 1983.
5.20     In 1987 PDCP entered into an arrangement with PNB and the Government
Whereby the Government shall pay amortizations of PDCP loans to IBRD and ADB
from August 1986 to April 1987 amounting to P 261 million. This amount,
representing Government assistance to PDCP, would be restructured by PYB into
a five year loan to PDPC, with semi-annual installments. The Memorandum of
Agreement, amongst PNB, the Department of Finance and PDCP, runains unsigned.
This is due to a disagreement between PNB and the National Government as to
who will bear the loss in case PDCP fails to pay the amortization due. To
date, PDCP has remained current in its payment of principal and interest
amortization falling due to the Government and Far East Bank.
5.21     Audit.  PDCP's annual audited reports have been received regularly by
the Bank. The reports of its external auditors, Sycip, Gorres and Velayo on
PDCP's financial statements were without qualifications from 1978 to 1981.
Their opinion on the 1982 to 1985 financial statements were, however,
qualified as to the effects on the statements of deferring foreign exchange
losses of P 10.2 million incurred in 1982 and previous years, and amortizing
these losses over five years starting in 1983, in accordance with a practice
allowed by the Central Bank. Since in 1986, PDCP restated its 1985 financial
statements to effect the retroactive charge of these foreign exchange losses
against 1982 operations, the auditors' report on the 1986 accounts were
unqualified. The 1987 financial statements were qualified by the auditors to
the effect that at December 31, 1987, an additional allowance for doubtful
accounts of P 79 million should be charged to 1987 operations; the Central
Bank permitted PDCP to provide for this allowance over a five-year period
starting in 1988 in equal monthly amounts.

V1. DEVELOPMENT ROLE OF PDCP
6.1      Economic Impact. As a private development finance institution in the
Philippines, PDCP has played an important role in the financial system by
extending financial assistance to the various sectors of the economy. In
recent years, however, this role has been in decline, as evident in the
preceding paragrapns. Although PDCP's overall impact on the economy as a
financial institution has been small, total PDCP financial assistance from
1963 to 1986 amounted to P 6.7 billion benefitting some 1,537 projects.
6.2      PDCP's figures indicate that the projects which received direct PDCP
financial assistance have provided employment to 71,522 individuals for the
past 23 years with a corresponding annual payroll of P 709 million. These
projects bave contributed P 48 billion in net sales and some P 6 billion to
the country's net domestic product since 1963. PDCP estimates that these
projects have generated about $587 million in net foreign exchange
earnings/savings as of year-end 1986.
6.3      Manpower Training.  PDCP has also served as a valuable training and
consulting institution, providing programs in term lending and executive
development for the local market as well as for foreign development finance
companies.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.1      PDCP's record in meeting its objectives, established under Loan
1514-PH, of assisting enterprises in the industrial sector througz lending to
economically desirable and financially viable projects has been mixed. On the
one hand, PDCP met the objective of resource transfer by disbursing loan
proceeds much faster than in previous loans. Moreover, the project was
successful in job creation and generation of foreign exchange
earnings/savings. On the other hand, a large number of subprojects faced
problems which were reflected in a high level of arrears, a situation which
necessitated restructurings and reschedulings. Their operational performance
was substantially below appraisal estimates in terms of financial and economic
rates of return. The overall performance, however, is not that grim if viewed
in the light of (a) the political and economic uncertainties and severe
recessionary conditions that plagued the country in the 1983-86 period and
(b) the subborrowers' increasing debt service obligations as a result of
massive peso devaluations in that period.
7.2      The inability of many subborrowers to service payments of interest
and repayments of principal that increased in peso terms led to losses being
sustained by PDCP. However, the problem now facing PDCP is caused by non-
performing assets which provide no cash-flow to finance PDCP's increased
liability in peso terms. With more than 70 percent of its long term debt
liabilities denominated in foreign currency, PDCP's major problem is its
direct exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Its calculations show that
in spite of prompt debt repayments (as evidenced by reductions of its various



- 13 -
foreign currency obligations), PDCP's foreign currency obligations of P 1.478
billion equivalent as of 1983 increased to the equivalent of P 2.030 billion
by year-end 1987 because of adverse exchange rate movements. A ten percent
annual depreciation of the peso vis-a-vis the yen, DM and SwF would increase
the debt servicing requirements of PDCP and its subborrowers by P 1 billion
for 1988-1992. PDCP needs a major financial restructuring which should
include a long-term solution of the exchange risk it and its clients are
carrying.
7.3      To relieve its borrowers of a portion of their foreign currency risk
exposure, PDCP is exploring the possibility with the Government of
redenominating its IBRD and ADB accounts which are in Japanese yen, German
marks and Swiss francs into one currency, the US dollar, which would limit
PDCP's and its subborrowers' foreign exchange risk to one currency. The Bank
has supported PDCP's efforts to obtain a conversion (or redenomination) of its
existing h- currency subloans into US dollar subloans, pointing out to the
Department .,- Finance that such an arrangement would entail a sharing of the
components of the foreign exchange risk between the Government and the
subborrowers, with the former assuming the cross-currency risk between the US
dollar and the other currencies in IBRD's pool of funds, and the latter
assuming only the foreign exchange risk on the dollar. Such a redenomination
would also lessen the complexity and open-ended uncertainty of the foreign
exchange risk to PDCP's clients.
7.4      Nonetheless, even with resolution of the foreign exchange risk issue,
the magnitude of bad and doubtful debts and the shortfall, in foreign currency
terms, of collections and collateral assets has reached such proportions that
it has adversely affected PDCP's capital base, profitability and liquidity to
a degree that raises questions about the institution's viability and survival.
The severe collection shortfall that has nlagued it since 1974, leading to
arrears accumulation and subloan rescheduaings drained PDCP's cash resources.
The financial assistance thus far provided by Far East Bank and the Government
were short-term and ad-hoc solutions that did not address the essence of the
liquidity problem; the financial restructuring plan implemented in late 1986
assisted PDCP only in meeting its immediate liquidity needs, including
maturing amortizations on IIRD and ADB loans. As for its equity, it has
shrunk because of write-offs and provisions which exceeded its modest profits.
New equity investors would be required to inject new funds and/or capitalize
existing debt. However, its low levels of profitability make it difficult to
attract new equity, as the yield to new investors on such capital would be
low. There is also a lack of market funded medium to long term peso resources
available at a cost and in volumes sufficient to enable PDCP to build a peso-
denominated term loan portfolio; the main funding sources now being tapped are
credit lines aimed at smail and medium enterprises--IGLF, CFSME and ALF--a
fact that limits PDCP's new clientele.
7.5      PDCP's past financial difficulties can be explained by circumstances
largely outside its control--the adverse economic and political environment,
the accompanying peso devaluations and the resulting portfolio deterioration.
As regards the future, developments in the domestic financial system and in
the policies of multilateral and bilateral sources of funds have deprived PDCP
of its comparative advantage derived from enjoying special access to foreign
exchange funds: programs such as IGLP and ALF can now be tapped by a broad



- 14 -
range of financial institutions. In the liberalized and more competitive
environment, PDCP needs to redefine its comparative advantdge. This Involves
identifying its core business and "subsidiary" ones which can have synergistic
linkages with the core activity. This would mean that PDCP will have to
develop synergies between its core area of project finance and its
*subsidiary" investment banking operations. Such a strategy offers the
possibility of (a) developing a pool of expertise in finans;-al packaging; and
(b) participation in syndications led by PDCP or by other institutions.
7.6      PDCP has recognized the potential benefits of such a new strategic
orientation. While maintaining a presence in conventional forms of
development financing, it has taken steps to enter into or expand non-
traditional activities to make up, as far as possible, for its declining
operations, particularly those involving foreign currency exposure. It has
expanded its trust and mutual fund operations and resumed its investment house
activities. Efforts are currently being exerted to take advantage of the
Government's privatization program and the conversion of foreign currency
loans into equity in Philippines enterprises. However, the investment banking
business has yet to grow to a 'critical" mass and other fee-related activities
such as insurance broking, trading and management consultancy do not appear to
fit into a coherent strategic framework where they would have a synergistic
relationship with PDCP's financing business.
7.7      The future is unclear.  Whether PDCP can develop a sound financial
base for its new orientation remains to be seen. This would depend on its
ability to raise long-term funds. Given the country's interest rate structure
and the preemption of the market in peso funds by the Government to finance
its budgetary deficits, it would be difficult, at this stage, for PDCP to
raise the needed funds in appropriate maturities at an acceptable price.
Raising foreign funds would be even more difficult given PDCP's current
financial picture. PDCP has initiated a dialogue with the Government on
possible solutions to these problems, with the Government indicating
willingness to give assistance provided (a) it be allowable within the
framework of existing laws and regulations; (b) it be at least cost (not zero
cost) to the Government; (c) other creditors, notably Far East Bank make a
commensurate contribution; and (d) PDCP strengthen its capital base by
building up its equity position.
7.8      Lessons.  Experience in executing the project suggests the following
lessons:
(i) PDCP is directly and profoundly affected by changes in its
environment over which it has no control. As its subborrowers
assumed the foreign exchange risk, they suffered heavy losses as
a result of the major devaluations from 1983 to 1986. This led
to severe repayment problems which were translated into high
arrears and low collection levels for PDCP, thus undermining the
institution's financial position.



- 15 -
(ii)  In retrospect, it is clear that it is difficult for private
enterprises which do not eamn foreign exchange to bear the
foreign exchange risk. In an environment of market-oriented
domestic interest rates and free capital movements, a better
approach would be for the government to assuwe the foreign
exchange risk for a market-related fee.
(iii)  At the time of appraising Loan 1514-PH, emphasis was placed on
the mobilization of commercial foreign curreucy resources but
not on domestic resource mobilization by PDCP. Excessive
reliance on foreign currency funds on the liability side and
foreign currency loans on the asset side contributed
significantly to PDCP's losses and poor performance. In the
future. more effort should be spent on addressing constraints on
domestic resource mobilization such as limited capital markets,
and implementation of strategies for raising funds in the
domestic market.
