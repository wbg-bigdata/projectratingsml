3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objectives of the project were to reduce the quantity of petroleum hydrocarbons entering the
international waters of the Mediterranean and to comply with MARPOL 73/78 Convention requirements.
The project also achieved, among other objectives, development of a comprehensive and integrated
system for the management of oil pollution caused by marine sources, thus ensuring commonality of
approaches and methodologies, promoting exchange of information and coordination, enhancing
monitoring capability among the countries in the region for preventing and combating oil pollution, and
improving the quality of the marine envirorment.
These objectives were successfully attained and deemed to be appropriate and in line with the
govemment's international commitment to monitor compliance with international conventions related to
marine pollution. They were clear and realistic with regard to national policies and regional agreements (
Union du Maghreb Arabe-UMA agreement). A major institutional outcome of the project has been
development of a framework for a national and regional comprehensive approach to the management of
oil pollution through enhancement of the capacity to assess and monitor oil pollution, enactment of
national oil spill contingency planning and response capabilities NCP), drafting of regional contingency
plan (RCP), and purchase of standardized equipment to combat pollution. Furthermore, the project also
initiated a cost recovery system at port level through an adequate tariff structure, and at the national
level through creation of an environmental fund and enactment of a law regarding fees and penalties and
a polluter-pay rule.
The project was designed to enhance the country's capacity to implement its environmental action plan,
which aims, in particular, to fight oil pollution, protect the marine environment and beaches, and
encourage the participation of the environmental agencies and others entities in efforts to protect the
environment. In this regard, the preparation of the project called for great attention and commitment
from the Govemment of Algeria (GOA) to identify the most appropriate and most representative
institutions, such as the Direction des Porls (DP) in the Ministry of Transport, and three port enterprises
(Arzew, Skikda, and Bejaia) to implement the project. DP represented the country in the regional
common effort.
No specific technical risk was identified during preparation, except the risk related to the govemment's
willingness to maintain its cooperation with the other recipients, Tunisia and Morocco, to prepare and
adopt the NCP and the cooperative agreement to enforce regulations that deal with marine pollution
problems, and implement an adequate cost recovery system. This risk was mitigated by: (a) the
commitment of the three govemments to follow up on the preparation study and implement study
recommendations related to the above aspects, and the project components as defined in para. 3.3; (b)
the national and regional benefits resulting from project implementation, especially the investments
carried out for coastal and ports protection; (c) enactment of NCP, preparation of an advanced draft of a
RCP, and agreement signed by the three port authorities on a joint cooperation for combating accidental
oil spills; and (d) comprehensive project preparation and implementation carried out with the cooperation
of local authorities through a regional committee for project implementation (CRCP). Furthermore, close
Bank supervision has ensured maximum success of project implementation during the various stages of
the project, and contributed to achieving its objectives.
3.2 Revised Objective:
N.A.
3.3 Original Components:
The project consisted of two main components: (a) national elements; and (b) regional elements.
(a)    National Elements. The national elements include the following:
1-    Physical elements:
-2 -



(i)    construction or rehabilitation of sheds to store equipment for combating
oil spills (floating booms, dispersant, skimmer heads, accessories, etc.
(ii)   provision of oil spill response and cleanup equipment and dispersant,
and oil spill response training;
(iii)  improvement of the operational efficiency of the deballasting station
located in the port of Arzew to receive and handle ballast waters and
bilge waters, and provision of additional related laboratory equipment
(four laboratories equipped) to monitor oil content in the sea water;
2- Institutional elements:
(i)    Oil spill National Contingency Plan;
(ii)    Monitoring and compliance: The regulatory mechanism included two
elements: (a) monitoring capability; and (b) an environmental
management framework.
(b)    Regional Elements. Preparation and implementation of a program designed to provide a
multilateral   framework within which the activities referred to in (a) are developed within a common
approach:
(i)    Regional oil spill environmental sensitivity and contingency plans; and
(ii)    Training.
The project was the first of its kind in the region. In that sense it was innovative in its design and
conception. The physical as well as the institutional components of the project were designed in close
consultation with the executing agency, and local and regional authorities. All components and activities
were carried out satisfactorily, and were the key factors in strengthening the country's capacity to handle
oil pollution. The project as such increased the environmental authority's awareness as to the threat of oil
poilution, and is considered the most important vehicle for abiding by intemational regulations and
enforcing their implementation.
Physical components were successfully implemented, and included the construction of sheds and
warehouses for storing equipment, and the purchase of oil spill response and cleanup equipment and
dispersant. Training on operation of the equipment was also included in the purchase contract.
Regarding the modernization of treatment facilities and recycling of oily residues, the rehabilitation,
renovation, of the deballasting station in Arzew will ensure that treated ballast water meets MARPOL
standards.
The main institutional and policy element of the project was the development and implementation of an
oil spill NCP. This plan incorporates the concept of risk assessment to identify and prioritize key actions
to be taken at both the port and national levels. The monitoring element, including auditing of sea waters
through sample analysis of oil content, was carried out through a selected national laboratory. A
baseline of data and measuring locations essential to assessing the impact of the project on improving
the quality of sea water was established in designated areas agreed upon with the Bank. Reports on the
findings of the analysis have been produced intermittently. The chosen laboratory did not perform
satisfactorily due to lack of and delays in purchasing equipment.
The regional component included two major elements: the RCP and training. The RCP is intended to
serve as a template to link the national plans of the three countries. Elements of the plans include
appropriate responses to protect sensitive coastal resources, and potential for transport of spilled product
to other local or foreign ports. These plans include linkage of equipment and manpower to regional
needs, and identification of extemal sources of assistance. Part of this task has consisted of ensuring
that equipment purchased under the project is the same in the three countries, and training courses and
simulation exercises have been undertaken jointly. These have further promoted the concept of a
regional approach for spill response. A joint cooperative agreement was signed among the ports of
Algiers, Arzew, Bejaia and Skikda (Algeria), "Office d'Exploitation des Ports" (ODEP -Morocco), and
- 3 -



"Office de la Marine Marchande et des Ports" (OMMP - Tunisia), defining the conditions and procedures
for using all available equipment and personnel to combat accidental oil spills. The cooperative
agreement identifies responsibilities in case of accidental oil spills regarding exchange of information,
mobilizing of equipment, actions by each party, etc.
Training has been provided for those who are responsible for combating oil spills, and for control of
navigation traffic, deballasting stations, and oil terminals. Three main groups participated in the
program: Level I included management personnel of port enterprises, supervising officers managing the
civil protection function, and those responsible for coordinating the intervention in case of an accidental
oil spill. Level 11 included port officers, anci civil protection staff responsible for organizing and managing
the protection of coastal sites. Level Ill included ground staff of the port enterprises and assistant civil
protection officers likely to be managing the cleanup sites or putting equipment into operation. Training
was carried out on a regional basis so as to familiarize the personnel with working together using the
same equipment and procedures. Training that was carried out locally made the fullest use of existing
vocational and technical institutions and facilities.
3.4 Revised Components:
There was no revision in project components.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
No review was made
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project achieved all its objectives regarding regional cooperation, standardization of approach, and
strengthening of national and regional capacity to handle oil pollution and comply with the MARPOL
requirements regarding the norms for discharging oil into the Mediterranean. The most important
outcomes are: (a) prevention as well as preparedeness to combat oil spills systems are in place, (b)
enactment of a NCP, (c) preparation of an advanced draft RCP, and (d) joint training carried out for
regional staff from the three participating countries on contingency plan and the prevention and cleaning
of oil spills. Annual reports on sea water analysis (oil content in the water) have been intermittently
provided, due to delayed purchase of laboratory equipment and chemicals. In addition, effluent from
deballasting stations are now being recycled in the existing refinery and/or sold to private users.
Cooperation is considered highly satisfactory. CRCP members meet regularly and have been able to
handle regional procurement, and have succeeded in ensuring continuous coordination among involved
administrations in their respective countries.
The project has contributed to efficient cooperation among concerned administrations and within the
region to prevent and control oil pollution. The development of a sub-regional working group and
organization of joint training have helped to enhance marine pollution management through development
of a common approach and mechanisms. The project has improved the countries' capabilities to deal
with accidental oil spills, and provided equipment and facilities to collect and treat oily ballast and bilge
waters, thus reducing hydrocarbon contamination in the Mediterranean. The project has created the
foundation for permanent cooperation in the region in terms of monitoring and compliance auditing, state
of marine pollution reporting, and a common approach to spill response. It has potentially met the GEF
objective of protecting intemational waters. Recovered oily materials is being re-refined, in concert with
local and national waste management programs. The project's well-identified components also helped in
strengthening and enhancing port and national regulations, regulatory mechanisms, and the linkage
between environmental monitoring and management.
4.2 Outputs by components:
All originally identified components. have been completed satisfactorily despite delays in purchasing
laboratory equipment and renovation of the deballasting station in Arzew. These delays occurred
because of inappropriate identification by the consultant of the equipment needed and the scope of
rehabilitation work. The project will be closed on June 30. 2000, with six additional months granted
- 4 -



compared to the original date, to allow disbursement of the balance of the grant, about US$460,000
equivalent, against equipment purchased and shipped after December 31, 1999. The regional
components have been completed to the satisfaction of all concemed parties, including training and
procurement of standardized equipment and dispersant for combating oil spills. The detailed list of
equipment procured and total personnel trained are in Annex 7.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate /f return:
The project resulted in significant, although not quantified, economic benefits through provision of
environmental benefits. While formal economic and financial returns analysis (environmental economic
benefit and financial return analysis were not required for pilot phase projects ) have not been attempted
for the SAR and the ICR, it is widely recognized that pollution impacts all aspects of the marine
economy. Maintenance of and improvements to the existing coastal marine environment are necessary
for the continued success of coastal economic activities. Further, methods and protocols for improving
the quality of the marine environment, as achieved by the project, will serve as a model for establishing
similar facilities in other Mediterranean ports. The development of a generic oil spill contingency and
response led the government to implement the plan on a nationwide basis for all ports.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
No formal FRR has been attempted in the SAR and the ICR. The project was based on the need to
address potential negative environmental impacts of discharged ballast and bilge waters, as well as
accidental oil spills, in the southwestem Mediterranean, and the lack of resources to tackle this issue of
global importance. Given the competing demands of the various sectors on their national budgets, the
Maghreb countries were reluctant to, on their own, allocate funds to combat the problem of marine
pollution. The availability of grant funds reinforced the govemments' commitment to participate in
reducing the risk of marine pollution. Pollution funds have been set up, and decrees and laws regarding
fees and fines to be paid by polluters have been revised and enforced. A model for recovering the
operating and investment cost of the deballasting station has been developed for port authorities.
Proposals for port tariff adjustments to progressively cover the cost of environmental protection are
being made at the beginning of each fiscal year.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
During the preparation and implementation phases of the project, GOA undertook several actions,
including the creation of a pollution fund and enactment and revision of several legal aspects dealing
with pollution, including the maritime code, introduction of environmental responsibilities within port
authorities, revision of penalties and fees, institution of the polluter-pay principle, and creation of the
Haut conseil de l'environnement et de developpement durable.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5. 1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
Only one factor that partially affected implementation of the joint training program is worth mentioning. It
is related to the security issue in Algeria, which delayed the training scheduled to take place in Algiers by
almost a year. A joint effort undertaken by the Bank and Algerian authorities to overcome the security
issue reassured the consultant that it would be safe to carry out the delayed sessions. The training was
completed in June and September 1999.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The project included several elements to be implemented directly through DP and Port Enterprises, the
implementing agencies (national components), and through DP as a member of the CRCP (regional
components, including training, studies, and standardized equipment). This made the project complex
and difficult to implement. Several factors affected the project.
(a)   Factors with a positive influence included:
-5 -



(i) The GOA passed environmental legislation and issued a set of guidelines and
adopted an action plan for the protection of the environment. The action plan includes medium-to-long
term objectives and the development of an integrated national environment management framework
while it moves towards liberalization and a market economy. The Govemment identified the main
environmental priorities and policy options for reducing pollution and conserving natural resources. It
acknowledges the necessity to assess pollution and that, therefore, a better information collection and
monitoring system is needed together with strengthened institutions and a refined legal framework. In
addition the regulatory Framework in Algeria has institutions and several laws and regulations which
deal with environmental protection. The major legal text is the law regarding environmental protection
which expresses basic principles of a strategy. The law and its promulgating decrees includes chapters
on contamination of the ocean, and procedures and systems of enforcement. It foresees the creation of
an Environment Fund, and a special corps of environmental inspectors and controllers, with power over
local authorities. Additional implementing decrees related to pollution in general and to oil pollution
management in particular were published, i.e, regulation of industrial and bilge oil disposal, collection
and treatment of oil materials and lubricants, definition of pollution level standards for surface water and
beaches, obligation of ships to declare carriage of dangerous and toxic materials, and intervention of the
coast guard in case of pollution at sea.
(ii) To be able tc, implement all provisions of MARPOL 73/78, both current and
future proposed, GOA recognized the need for improving the efficiency of the existing facilities for waste
treatment and reception, and the need for purchase of environmental monitoring and combating
equipment, development of oil spill contingency and response plans and training.
(iii) Through prevision of the grants, Algeria had established a long and fruifful
working relationship within the institutions; and agencies in charge of environment, and with the two other
participating countries through establishment of the CRCP and mutual agreement for cooperation among
port authorities. This established relationship ensured a deep degree of trust and confidence within the
country's institutions and among the countries in the region which has been critical to success and
certainly made project implementation smoother.
(b) There were also some less positive factors:
(i)    All aspects of maritime pollution prevention and combat require
considerable investments to meet international requirements set by intemational conventions which will
be conflicting with the demand for continuing economic growth. This competition for funds made
investments in "environmental improvements" difficult to promote.
(ii) While the port authorities were responsible for providing waste reception
facilities, the cost of running such facilities made it difficult to implement the cost recovery principle for
investments and operations.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The well-structured and well-managed implementing agencies, DP and the port enterprises, with
significant experience in dealing with Bank projects, made project preparation and implementation a
successful undertaking.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The project was estimated to cost US$7.4 million equivalent, including physical and price contingencies,
of which US$6.9 million equivalent in for,sign currency and US$0.5 million equivalent in local currencies.
The actual figure at closing are as follows: US$11.9 million equivalent, of which US$6.9 million and
US$5.0 million in foreign currency and local currency respectively. The increase is mainly in local
- 6 -



currency and shows the government effort and willingness to expand its investment in prevention and
control of oil pollution activities. Summary of project costs is given below and details are given in annex
2. The above costs are net of taxes and customs duties as the Govemment waived taxes and duties on
all items procured under the project. The costs reflect actual prices using the prevailing exchange rate
during project implementation. The foreign exchange cost of the project is financed through a SDR5.0
million equivalent to US$6.9 million, concessional funding secured from the GET core funds, and the
local funding of US$5.0 million provided by the implementing agencies.
It is expected that the grant will be totally disbursed at the closing date, June 30, 2000.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The existing institutions in Algeria, including the implementing agency, have the capacity and the skills to
operate and maintain the facilities and equipment provided under the project. In addition, the project
provided training to implement and operate the national and regional contingency plans. Technical
assistance was geared toward developing mechanisms to achieve financial sustainability for the facilities
and regional organizations. The government and the executing agency are implementing study
recommendations to cover investment and operating costs. Meanwhile, the legal and institutional
framework, including an environmental fund, have been enacted and will provide the additional funds
needed to operate and maintain the facilities and equipment supplied under the project. Furthermore, the
project make the environmental authority aware of the threat posed by oil pollution. This has resulted into
an additional investment financed through local funds, including port contingency plans, periodic testing
of equipment, and periodic simulation exercises to test the NCP, and in a request from the countries in
the South Mediterranean Sea (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia) to GEF to finance a follow up
project.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Based on the foreseen results of the project and its highly satisfactory rating for development and
implementation objectives, GEF provided funds to carry out a feasibility study to expand the benefit of
the project to the south Mediterranean, which includes Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. A
PCD has been prepared and approved by the Bank management; however, the GEF Secretariat, in order
to coordinate among international waters projects, decided not to go with the project until the final result
of the ongoing studies in the straits of Malaca and Bosphoros are published. The first phase of the
proposed project would consist of an institutional arrangement enabling the five countries and the oil
industry to cooperate in protecting the Mediterranean and preventing oil spills.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank identified key issues and prepared the project in a timely fashion. The project was identified in
December 1992 and appraised in August 1993, with the staff appraisal report issued in October 1993.
The grant was approved on April 6, 1994, and made effective on May 20, 1994.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision was also efficient. The annual average input of staff resources for supervision was
about 9 staff-weeks, which included various specialties (see annex 4). This was possible because
supervisions were coordinated with supervision of other port projects. Bank performance was enhanced
by use throughout the project of the same team, consisting of a financial analyst and port engineer. This
provided an element of consistency of approach to the issue and assurance that the project would be
successfully implemented.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
-7-



Bank performance at all steps of project preparation, appraisal, and implementation was satisfactory,
thus ensuring that there was no deviation from the defined objectives and components, and that the local
implementing agency as well as the CRCP were adequately staffed and equipped to implement the
project. The Bank's role in maintaining and cementing relationships among the countries and CRCP
members has been recognized by all parties.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The strong involvement of the borrower during preparation phase of the project was one of the major
aspects of project success. Its close follow-up of the feasibility study financed under a PPF grant
contributed to the appropriate definition of project scope and components. In addition, its commitment to
the regional activity was a cornerstone for the creation of the CRCP, which became the implementing
body for the regional component of the project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
With the exception of the approval of a final RCP, borrower implementation of the national and regional
components of the project was excellent and timely. The preparation of the final RCP draft experienced
some delays due to difficulty in reachin9i consensus within each administration involved, but the final
draft was completed before the closing ol' the project. It constitutes a major step to materialize regional
cooperation provision included in the UMA treaty.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
During 1994 and early 1995, the Algerian authorities, in collaboration with the other beneficiaries focused
on equipment procurement, and training. Most procurement processes were well advanced by the first
implementation supervision mission, and were essentially complete by the mid 1995 With respect to the
rehabilitation of the deballasting stations in Arzew and equipment procurement for the waste facilities,
the borrower experienced some delays due to inappropriate design and underestimation of the
rehabilitation costs. The scope of the work and its cost were redefined more appropriately and the
rehabilitation was completed in the first quarter of year 2000. The executing agency provided the
additional funds needed to complete the work. With respect to VTS, containment and cleaning
equipment, laboratory equipment and training, DP has through consolidated bid packages generated
competitive prices and savings.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
One of the key objectives of the project was to use successful application of various aspects as a model
for other ports within Algeria. This objective was met and exceeded. The proposed oil spill contingency
and response plan has been made the delsignated national model and is being introduced in other ports.
Further, the successful development and implementation of the project components, both national and
regional, provide an incentive to manage and reduce ship and port wastes. As shown in Annex 7,
covenants and targets were generally met. The borrower's performance is evaluated as satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
This project was mainly funded by a grant from GEF and was the first major Funded project within the
"Pollution Reduction in Intemational Waters" category during the pilot phase in the Mediterranean. It can
be judged to have clearly met GEF criteria.
The regional approach of the project has proven to have a high demonstration value. Through enhancing
and upgrading national and regional standards, policies, and waste monitoring and rehabilitation of waste
reception and handling facilities, the prcject has convinced GOA of the environmental benefit of the
investments. This has triggered adoption of a multiport program to be implemented over the coming
years, including a ship waste tracking system, port oil spill contingency and response plan for major

Algerian ports, and oil spill response training exercises for all ports and other relevant agencies. Further,
GOA will be implementing a port fee schedule on a national basis with conjunction of environmental
fund, provide a reserve fund for expanding existing facilities, construct new facilities, expand training,
and purchase and rehabilitate response equipment.
Success of the project can be attributed to both the borrower's and the Bank's approach to the project.
The Bank utilized a multidisciplinary team of a financial analyst, port engineer, and an environmental
specialist. This provided consistency throughout, from design and appraisal to implementation. While
several administrations and agencies were involved in the project, key leadership was provided by DP,
ensuring a national consistency and regional coordination as active member of the CRCP.
Port and coastal environmental management is inherently complex due to overlapping jurisdictions of
different departments and ministries, port authorities, and private interests. If Tunisia, Algeria, and
Morocco had not strongly committed themselves to the project and had not had existing efficient port
institutions, and if they had not created the CRCP base upon which the project could be constructed, this
project would have been much more difficult to implement. Replication and/or extension of this project to
other countries can be successful, if there are established regulatory and management regimes suitable
to the task. Altematively, such regimes should be first established and stabilized.
Management of ships and port wastes is only one aspect of port and coastal maritime environmental
management. The success of a ship waste project can be further enhanced by (a) adoption of an
environmental coastal zone and port management plan (a concept already being initiated by the Xiamen
Special Economic Zone); (b) implementation of other pollution control activities (e.g., oil spill response);
and (c) control and management of land-based sources of pollution.

PROCESS DE TRAITEMENT DES HUILES ET
EAUX DE BALLAST DE LA STATION
S D 3 D'ARZEW






Annexe 2/2
IProcess de traitement des huiles et eaux de ballast de la station SD 3 d'Arzew
La renovation et la modernisation de la station de deballastage SD 3 d'Arzew est
bas6e sur la mise en place de deux process differents; a savoir:
- rejet des eaux en mer a moins de 15 PPM,
- revalorisation et recyclage des slops.
Pour  le  fonctionnement  efficace  des  deux  process,  le  bbneficiaire
(Sonatrach - RTO ) a procede a:
- Des separations complete des installations.
- Des modifications adequates des organes avec l'incorporation d'equipements de
haute precision.
- L'installation de mat6riels et equipements de derniere g6neration pour une
epuration optimale des eaux de ballast et le traitement efficace des slops.
- La mise en place des canalisations en fibre composite en guise d'acier au carbone
pour faire face a la corrosion due au milieu marin agressif.
Principe de fonctionnement de la SD 3
Premier stade de traitement
Les eaux de ballast en provenance des tankers sont dirigees vers le bac de
reception 3T 1/A (2300 m3) puis au besoin vers les bacs 3T 1/B et 3 T 5 de
capacit6 respective de 3300 m3 et 3500 m3 au moyen de K liftoil b. Un premier
ecremage des huiles s'effectuera au niveau de chaque bac. II permettra la
r6cuperation de facon continue de toutes les huiles surnageant en surface par effet
de densite. Cette s6paration est appelee separation gravitationnelle primaire
naturelle. Les huiles obtenues seront dirigees vers un bourbier d'huile et les eaux
charg6es d'huile en suspension seront dirigees vers les bassins cellules 6 et 5 ou 4
et3.
Une seconde decantation se fera au moyen du a Moby duc k mobile, les huiles
encore surnageant en surface seront recuperees et envoyees vers le meme
bourbier a huile et les eaux acheminees vers un oleofiltre.
Deuxieme stade de traitement
Les eaux restantes sont des effluents chargees d'huiles invisibles dissoutes dans
l'eau qu'on fait passer dans (( l'ol6ofiltre  oCi une filtration forc6e par air comprime
s'effectuera. Les huiles seront dirig6es vers le bourbier a l'huile et les eaux
retournees vers les cellules 1 ou 2 pour observation et dernier contr6le avant rejet
vers la mer.
Si la teneur en huile reste excessive, les eaux chargees d'huile dissoute seront
dirig6es vers un concentrateur / separateur et c'est la phase finale de separation a
la c6ramique avant rejet vers la mer.



Annexe 2/3
Traitement des huiles collect6es
Les huiles collectees dans le bourbier seront exp6diees vers un des deux bacs de
rechauffage pour en extraire les dernires fractions d'eau au moyen de purge. Les
huiles obtenues non degradees seront expbdiees vers le bac 3 t 4 pour les
melanger au petrole brut recupere des bras de chargement des postes P1 et P2 et
etablir une circulation necessaire a la premiere 6tape d'homogeneisation.
Dans un second temps et apres une derniere purge, le m6lange d'huiles non
degradees - petrole brut est expedie vers le bac 3 T 6 pour une derniere
homogeneisation a chaud des hydrocarbures, huiles traitees. Ce produit 6vacue de
la station de d6ballastage par camions citerne, est cede pour etre utilise par la
raffinerie.

Annexe 312
Programme de formation r6alisd dans le cadre du projet
durant la p6niode 1995-1999.
Le programme de formation partie integrante du projet, a ete realise sur la periode
1995 - 1999, par le consultant du CEDRE ( France ) retenu apres consultation par le
CRCP.
L'objectif de la composante formation est de faire acquerir aux personnels des
secteurs concernes: Transports, Marine nationale, Entreprises portuaires, Protection
civile, Services de l'environnement, Sonatrach, Ecoles et lnstituts maritimes de
formation et organismes de recherche, les connaissances d'ordre technique,
scientifique et operationnel dans le domaine de la prevention et de la lutte contre la
pollution petroliere. Les stages de formation se sont deroules dans un cadre
regional.
Identification des niveaux de formation
Niveau 1: gestion de crise
Ce niveau concerne les cadres appartenant a l'etat-major responsable de la
conduite des operations en cas de pollution majeure. Ces cadres sont charges de
l'evaluation de la situation et de la prise des mesures necessaires pour lutter contre
les effets de cette pollution.
Trois sessions de formation de niveau 1 d'une duree de cinq jours par session se
sont deroulees a Tunis (Mai 1995) A Casablanca ( Janvier 1996) et A Alger
(Mai 1999), 26 stagiaires algeriens ont participe a ces sessions.
Niveau 2: Direction des op6rations sur site
Ce programme a ete oriente  en direction des commandants des operations
intervenant en mer et a terre en cas de pollution. Ce programme vise A doter les
officiers de la marine nationale, des ports et de la protection civile des
connaissances necessaires pour la traitement de la pollution en mer et sur le littoral.
Des participants de ce stage sont selectionnes pour assurer les fonctions de
formateur. Six stages d'une dur6e de cinq jours chacun se sont deroules entre 1995
et 1997 a Brest en France au niveau du siege du CEDRE et ont vu la participation
de 36 stagiaires algeriens.
Niveau 3: Intervention
Ce niveau concerne la grande masse des personnels d'intervention en mer et a
terre. II est assure par les personnels selectionnes parmi les participants au stage
du niveau 2, qui ont acquis des connaissances enrichies sur l'organisation et les
techniques de lutte contre la pollution petroliere.
La formation des formateurs s'est deroulee en trois sessions: Tunis (Mai 1996),
Casablanca ( Juillet 1997 ) et Alger (Octobre 1999). Les 12 participants algeriens
formes ont recu chacun une mallette contenant le materiel pedagogique necessaire
a l'organisation de stages locaux d'une duree de troisjours.
Deux sessions de formation de niveau 3 dispens6es par les formateurs algeriens ont
regroupe 40 participants; elles se sont tenues a Skikda en Mai 1998 ( 20
participants) et Bejaia en Avril 1999 ( 20 participants).

ANALYSTE FINANCIER PRINCIPAL
CHEF DU PROJET FEM
(ALGERIE - MAROC - TUNISIE)
Objet I - Rapport d'achevement projet FEM
"Gestion de la pollution p6troliere dans le Sud - Ouest
de la M6diterran6e( Alg6rie, Maroc, Tunisie) "
J'ai I'honneur d'accuser reception du rapport d'ach6vement du
projet cite en objet et vous faire part, dans ce qui suit, de nos
commentaires.
Le rapport donne une vue complete et coh6rente du projet, depuis son
initiation jusqu'a son achevement, il met en evidence les diff6rentes
etapes suivies pour sa r6alisation.
11 est releve la realisation satisfaisante de 1'ensemble des objectifs du
projet notamment en matiere de cooperation regionale, de normalisation
d'approche et de consolidation aux niveau national et regional, des
capacit6s de traitement de la pollution petroliere et de conformit6 avec les
exigences de la convention internationale MARPOL pour ce qui est des
normes de rejet en MWditerran6en, repondant ainsi aux objectifs de FEM
dans la protection des eaux internationales.
Toujours en matiere de coop6ration,  le projet a contribue au
d6veloppement d'une coop&ration efficace entre les administrations et les
organismes nationaux au niveau de la region pour prevenir et contr6ler la
pollution petroliere.
66 129  1- 74.76.24 :   A1 - 74.06.81 :     - 1    -  _    - a          .119



Cette cooperation est illustree par la mise en place et le bon
fonctionnement du CRCP charge de la realisation et du suivi regional du
projet, l'organisation d'un programme commun de formation pour trois
pays et le developpement d'une approche et de mecanismes communs
pour creer et mettre en valeur un systeme de gestion de la pollution
marine.
Le choix judicieux de l'ensemble des composantes du projet dont la
realisation est jugee satisfaisante a permis d'approfondir et de developper
la reglementation nationale et portuaire, les mecanismes de regulation et
le lien entre la gestion et le contr6le environnemental.
Le rapport souligne les efforts et les nombreuses actions engages par le
Gouvernement Algerien tout au long de la preparation et de la realisation
du projet et qui se sont illustres principalement par la creation d'un Fonds
de depollution, la revision de cerl:ains aspects legaux traitant de la
pollution marine couvrant le cadre maritime, la responsabilite des
autorites portuaires en matiere de protection de 1'environnement,
I'augmentation substantielle des amendes, l'institution du principe
(( pollueur - payeur )> et la creation dii Haut Conseil de l'Environnement et
du Developpement Durable.
Au plan financier, I'apport du Gouvernement algerien a ete consequent
dans la realisation qualitative de ce projet. En effet 1'estimation initiale du
projet s 'elevait a 7,4 M US $ dont 6.9 mus $ finances par le don du FEM
et 0,5 MUS $ en monnaie locale pris en charge par le Gouvernement
Algerien. Le coOt final du projet se chiffre a 11,5 MUS $ dont 4,4 MUS $
finances par la partie algerienne.
L'utilisation rationnelle des fonds mobilises et le respect des delais de
realisation ont ete obtenus grace au role appreciable joue par la Banque
dans la conduite de ce projet a travers notamment la constance et les
nombreuses efforts fournis par une supervision de qualite.
L'utilisation appropriee de I'appel a! la concurrence et I'adoption de la
formule de l'achat groupe pour les trois pays de produits et d'equipements
ont permis l'obtention d'economies consistantes.
En ce qui concerne les rares points faibles de ce projet, le rapport note
avec justesse que la promotion des investissements dans le secteur de
1'environnement en Algerie se heurte a la rarete des fonds qui sont par
ailleurs apparemment sollicites par de nombreux secteurs aussi
prioritaires les uns que les autres.



Ainsi donc, et d'une maniere globale, la Direction des Ports adhere au
contenu du rapport et fait sienne ses conclusions et tient a rappeler que
ce projet a e  considere par la Banque et le FEM comme projet pilote et
devait, en cas de reussite, etre suivi par d'autres projets prenant en
charge les priorites cernees grace a cette premiere experience.
Veuillez Agreer, Monsieur le Chef de Projet, I'experience de ma
parfaite consideration.

Aspect Regional 2
Evaluation sommaire de l'aspect r6gional du projet
et de la coop6ration r6gionale entre les b6n6ficiaires
du projet Alg6rie - Maroc et Tunisie.
Le principal objectif du projet est de rbduire au niveau de la region Sud - Ouest de la
Mediterranbe le deversement d'hydrocarbures dans les eaux internationales de cette
mer menacbe par la pollution.
Dans ce cadre le projet a permis au niveau r6gional:
a) d'introduire une approche commune, des politiques de regulation et de
mbthodologies de travail;
b) de promouvoir 1'echange d'information et la coordination dans l'exbcution;
c) d'utiliser les donnees nationales pour bvaluer a long terme la tendance rbgionale
en matiere de pollution marine a la fois pour les eaux c6tieres nationales et les eaux
internationales adjacentes;
d) de mettre en valeur les capacitbs nationales de contr6le;
e) de d6velopper un cadre de gestion de 1'environnement c6tier.
A - ASPECT REGIONAL DU PROJET:
Le projet vise l'engagement de trois programmes specifiques en vue de fournir, sur
la base d'une approche commune, un cadre multilateral permettant le
dbveloppement de plans nationaux.
A.1. - Programme institutionnel
Le programme institutionnel concerne la prise en charge et le traitement, sur un plan
regional, des d6versements d'hydrocarbures, de la sensibilite environnementale des
plans d'urgence. Ces plans d'urgence serviront en premier lieu comme cadre pour
des plans nationaux et locaux et permettront dans une seconde etape la liaison des
plans d'urgence nationaux des trois pays. L'laboration de ces plans comportent des
r6ponses appropriees pour la protection contre la pollution, notamment celle des
ressources c6tieres sensibles, et le traitement des effets de cette pollution.
Les zones sensibles, les besoins en equipement et en formation identifies par les
plans d'urgence seront priorisbs.
La rbalisation de ce programme a permis la conclusion par les autorites portuaires
de l'Algerie, du Maroc et de la Tunisie d'un accord de cooperation et d'assistance
definissant les conditions et les procedures pour l'utilisation des 6quipements et des
personnels  disponibles  pour  combattre  les  deversements  accidentels
d'hydrocarbures.
L'approche rbgionale commune introduite par ce programme s'est caracterisee par
l'acquisition, au titre du projet, par les trois pays de meme bquipements et produits
destinbs A la lutte contre la pollution.



Aspect r6gional 3
A.2. Programme de formation
Le programme de formation identifie et arrete par le comite regional de coordination
du projet ( C R C P ) a e  realise dans son integralit6 sur une base regionale. La
formation s'est d6roul6e durant la periode 1995-1999 dans les trois pays et aupres
du consultant CEDRE (France). Elle devrait toucher plus de 500 b6neficiaires ( en
incluant les auditeurs libres) provenant des trois pays et devant servir aux niveaux
des etats majors de crise, des sites de commandement et des op6rations.
En complement a ce programme et grace aux formateurs formes dans le cadre du
projet, les trois pays ont elabore et engage la formation des personnels d'ex6cution.
Ces stages visent l'actualisation des connaissances et le recyclage de cette large
categorie de personnels concernes par la pollution marine par les hydrocarbures.
A.3. Programme de r6gulation, de contr6le et d'audit de conformit6
Ce programme met en evidence la necessit6 d'eviter le transfert des problemes de
pollution d'une region A une autre de la Mediterran6e.
-I propose l'elaboration et la mise en place de techniques financibres et de
recouvrement de couts en vue de promouvoir la mise en conformite et assurer la
perennite des investissements engages.
II vise aussi A suivre 1'evolution de la pollution par les hydrocarbures dans les eaux
de la region et en Mediterranee a travers le developpement d'un contr6le regulier A
la fois national et regional des eaux cdtieres et de haute mer adjacentes.
L'application et la recherche de solutions pour la mise en oeuvre des actions
prevues par ce programme font ressortir le besoin de reflechir sur I'ad6quation entre
les objectifs fixes et les moyens a mobiliser, de deglobaliser la demande de
recouvrement des couts en ciblant en priorite les activites les plus polluantes et
d'evaluer l'apport que pourrait avoir une structure regionale permanente pour la
concretisation de ce programme.
B - COOPERATION REGIONALE:
Le travail realise dans ce domaine a favorise la reussite du projet. II constitue ainsi
un investissement a long terme pour le secteur de l'environnement en particulier et
pour la cooperation regionale en g6n6ral.
Ces resultats positifs peuvent etre cernes a trois principaux niveaux:
B.1. Pr6paration et ex6cution du projet.
Le comite regional de coordination du projet regroupant les trois agences
d 'execution a constitu6 le cadre adequat pour le developpement d'une cooperation
regionale de qualite exig6e par les differentes etapes de preparation et d'execution.



Aspect r6gional 4
Cette experience a permis a l'Algerie au Maroc et a la Tunisie de selectionner les
memes consultants charges de letude du projet et de la formation et d'arreter la liste
des fournisseurs communs retenus pour l'acquisition des 6quipements et des
produits de luKte contre la pollution.
B.2. Formation regionale
La realisation de la formation sur une base regionale a mis en contact, aux diff6rents
niveaux concernes, les personnels d'etats major, de commandement operationnel et
d'execution des trois pays.
Ces contacts faciliteront dans l'avenir les interventions communes et les 6changes
d'informations.
B.3. Echange d'exp6rience
La preparation, la negociation, 1'ex6cution du projet et la realisation de la
composante formation ont regroupe les autorites de 1'environnement, des ports, des
finances et des autres organismes concernes appartenant aux trois pays.
Toutes ces etapes ont ete le lieu d'un echange fecond d'experiences, de
connaissances, et d'informations.
Les rapprochements oper6s en ces occasions ont e  a la base de la reussite du
projet et serviront ineluctablement d'une mani&re efficace la necessaire cooperation
entre l'Algerie, le Maroc et la Tunisie dans le domaine de 1'environnement et dans
les secteurs qui lui sont lies.
