ALGERIA/MOROCCO/TUNISIA
OIL POLLUTION MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.        Background. The Southwest coast of the Mediterranean sea, about 3000 km long, is subjected to heavy
oil traffic going through two major routes: Gibraltar strait, and Bizerte-Cap Bon in Tunisia. The average annual oil
traffic over 1991-1992 reached about 150 million tons, carried by about 1500 tankers and representing 30% of
world oil traffic. Pollution, from a variety of sources, is already a serious problem in this part of the Mediterranean.
While industrial effluent and urban sewage degrade harbors and coastal waters, much of the anthropogenic impact
on international waters is the result of ships' discharges of oily ballast and bilge waters, and accidental oil spills, one
per year on average. Surveys of hydrocarbon contamination indicate that the waters off the north African coast in
the south-western section of the Mediterranean have the highest incidence of tar balls, with an estimated 30% of the
dumped oil becoming tar residues on the beaches. Contamination in intemational waters has adverse impacts on the
economy of surrounding countries because of its serious, negative effects on tourism. Further, these tar residues
have the potential to degrade and taint fragile coastal ecosystems and coastal fisheries.
2.        Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia face environmental problems posed by oil pollution which is particularly
acute in ports and along coastal areas where major economic development is located. The three countries have
become increasingly concerned by environmental degradation and the threat it poses to their quality of life and
economic systems. Efforts to deal with problems posed to the environmental sector through domestic programs and
coordinated action plans at the regional level have intensified.
3.        In 1991, Algeria reorganized its environmental sector, and responsibility for the environment was
transferred to the "Ministere de l'Education Nationale" (MEN). A "Secretariat d'Etat a la Recherche Scientifique"
(SERC), created in 1992 and attached to the MEN, is responsible for environmental policies and management; all
agencies operating in the environmental sector have been put under its purview. The SERC became "Ministere
Delegue aux Universites et a la Recherche Scientifique' under the MEN in 1993. The first major legal text
regarding environmental protection was adopted in February 1983 which expresses three principles: (a) protection
of the environment as part of the socio-economic development strategy; (b) equilibrium between economic
objectives and protection of the environment; and (c) definition of all technical and regulatory aspects of projects in
the context of regional development. It includes chapters on the study of environmental impacts and procedures,
and systems of enforcement. It foresees the creation of an Environment Fund and a special corps of environmental
inspectors and controllers with power over local authorities. The law requires the promulgation of certain decrees,
some of which have already been promulgated, such as the creation of "Agence Nationale pour la Protection de
l'Environnement" (ANPE), creation of the above mentioned corps of inspectors and controllers, preparation of
environmental impact assessment studies, establishment of an environmental fund, notification and regulation of the
transport of hazardous substances, regulation of bilge oil and industrial disposals, collection and treatment of oil
materials and lubricants, and regulation of atmospheric emissions of gas, smoke, dust and solid particles from
industries. However, the environment sector study carried out by the Bank in early 1993 recommended that
additional investigation and studies be done to establish and coordinate the necessary mechanism and activities and
to better define the environmental institutions and objectives.
4.        The Moroccan Government's environmental policy consists of government commitment to: implement
an appropriate strategy aimed at carrying out sustainable development, solving immediate environmental issues and
preparing the groundwork for tackling long term environmental problems. This strategy is based on six main
principals: (a) coordination and encouragement of concerned institutions to tackle environmental problems; (b)
evaluation and control of environment; (c) environmental management; (d) legislation and regulation of
environmental activities; (e) sensitization, education and training of all concerned people; and (f) promotion and
enhancement of local, regional and international cooperation in environment protection activities. This policy will
be implemented by the "Sous-Secretariat d'Etat charge de l'Environnement (SSEE)" under the Ministry of Interior
and Information (MH). The SSEPE is the main central environment agency of the country responsible for making



policies, regulations, and setting up monitoring and enforcemcnt systems. The SSEE has already started the
implementation of certain environmental projects including: (a) identification of a national strategy for the
protection of the environment and sustainable development in collaboration with UNDP; (b) the national laboratory
for pollution control in collaboration with the Federal Republic of Germany; and (c) establishment of a national
framework to follow-up education and training on environmental issues in collaboration with UNEP.
Environmental Impact Assessment will be made mandatory for all investment projects, this will be enforced through
an appropriate institution which is being created within the SSEPE. To implement its own strategy and policy the
Government, through ongoing projects, is taking appropriate actions including: strengthening environmental
institutions (SSEE), enhancing institutional cooperation at the national and regional levels, updating the existing
legal framework, issuing new  laws and related implementation decrees, and re-vitalizing the National
Environmental Council whose mandate is to conserve natural resources and prevent environmental degradation.
However, while many laws and legal texts exist addressing protection of the envir-onment, many tend to overlap, and
regulatory enforcement is particularly weak. In addition to the existing sectorial laws and regulations i.e. a water
code, industrial investment code, mining code and maritime code, and in order to improve the effectiveness of the
existing regulatory framework, the Mll has prepared, with other concerned ministries, a draft law on environmental
protection which is considered to be the most appropriate legal framework defining the rights and obligations of all
concerned. The Moroccan Government is planning to consolidate its environmental legislation by preparing and
adopting the contingency plan for combatting oil pollution, and implement decrees of existing laws through Bank
financed projects now under preparation, e.g., the Environmental Management Project and the Oil Pollution
Management Project.
5.        The Government of Tunisia is nlow implementing a strategy and taking actions that would reduce the
risk of major environmental hazards and stop major causes of pollution. It is also formulating a strong institutional
and legal framework permitting better environmental managemiienit and law enforcemiient, as well as enhancing
institutional cooperation at the national and regional levels. The current action plan includes measures to be taken
at the nationalUsectoral level as defined in four major environmental protection progr-ams: (a) the 1(0 year action plan
for water and soil conservation; (b) the forestry program; (c) a national strategy to combat desertification; (d) a
national action program for environmental protection that aims to fight pollution, preserve the quality of life of
urban and rural populations, protect the marine environment and beaches, and preserve the country's archeological
heritage. The Tunisian global and multi-dimensional approach to environmental policy is based on three principal
ideas: (a) contain pollution and deterioration of the environment within acceptable limits defined by monitoring
standards; (b) organize the utilization of the natural environment for economic purposes in such a way as to
guarantee the renewal of all resources that are consumed; and (c) establish measures to protect and valorize all
aspects of natural or man-made sites.  This approach favors preventive actions based on enforcement of
environmental impact assessments and implementation of emergency plans to solve current major environmental
issues in selected regions. At the same time it recognizes the importance of cv'-ative measures in cases of absolute
necessity, such as applying the "polluter pays" principle to damage caused by pollution. The responsibility for
environmental management, and implementation of a national environmental policy is basically within the Ministry
of Environment and Land Planning (MEAT) and its two affiliated agencies, "Agence Nationale de la Protection de
l'Environnement (ANPE) and "Office National de l'Assainissement" (ONAS).  The legal framework for
environmental management in Tunisia however, has some weaknesses. These weaknesses are being tackled on the
basis of actions and recommendations stated in the Country Environmental Study and National Action Plan issued
in 1989 which includes: (a) pollution control; (b) procedures for environmental impact assessment; (c) punitive
sanctions to safeguard the environment; and (d) incentives to encourage clean-up. In addition, MEAT is preparing
national and regional contingency plans for combatting accidental oil spills and marine pollution.
6.        Project Objectives. The principal objective of the proposed project is to reduce the input of petroleum
hydrocarbons into the international waters of the Mediterranean. In addition, the project would: (a) ensure



- 3 -
commonality of approach, regulatory policies, and methodologies; (b) promote exchange of information and
coordination of implementation; (c) utilize national data sets to assess long-term regional trends in marine pollution,
both for national coastal waters and for adjacent international waters; (d) enhance the national monitoring
capability; and (e) develop a coastal environmental management framework. The proposed project focuses on
intervention and developing the institutional capability to improve the quality of coastal waters and beaches, as well
as potentially improve the marine productivity of the region. The project will be the first in a series of actions for
combatting marine oil pollution at the national and regional levels and as such it is a modest pilot project.
7.         Project Description. The proposed project would consist of both national and regional elements. It
includes: (a) enhancement of oil spill response capabilities in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia; and elaboration of
national and regional spill contingency plans; (b) provision of pollution monitoring mechanisms; (c) rehabilitation
and expansion of reception facilities at key ports to receive oily ballast and bilge waters; (d) provision of floating
equipment, tank trucks, dispersant's sprayers, skimmer booms, etc. for combatting oil spills; (e) training; and (f)
technical and marketing studies to evaluate re-refining or alternative uses of recovered oily materials.
8.         Project Implementation. The Bank, acting as Trustee of the Global Environment Trust Fund, provided
Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia each with a Project Preparation Advance (PPA) of SDR200,000 to prepare the
project. A committee for project preparation and coordination (CRCP) consisting of representatives of the three
countries has been created to ensure homogeneity of approach. equipment and training during project
implementation. The three representatives are the "Directeur des Ports" (DP) for Algeria, the "Directeur Gen6ral de
l'ODEP for Morocco and the "President Directeur G6neral de l'OPNT for Tunisia. The CRCP engaged a consulting
firm acceptable to the Bank to prepare the project. The consultants submitted the feasibility study report in July
1993, upon the basis of which the project was appraised in August 1993. Each entity, DP (Algeria), ODEP
(Morocco) and OPNT (Tunisia) will be responsible for implementing those parts of the project assigned to them and
for procuring civil works and equipment financed by the project. The CRCP will coordinate project activities with
the various agencies involved in project implementation, especially regarding the regional elements (RCP) and the
cooperative agreement referred to in para. 14. Because of the complexity of the proposed project, supervision will
take place every three months and a mid-term  review  will be carried out to assess the progress of project
implementation.
9.         Project Sustainablity.  The existing institutions in the three countries, including the three project
beneficiaries, have the competencies to operate and maintain the facilities and equipment provided under the
project.  In addition, the project will provide training to implement and operate the national and regional
contingency plans.  Technical assistance will be geared toward developing mechanisms to achieve financial
sustainability for the facilities and regional organizations and will include the development of means to cover
investment and operating costs based on the result of the technical and marketing studies to be carried out (para. 8).
Meanwhile, each of the three Governments will be committed to providing the funds needed to operate and maintain
its share of the facilities and equipment supplied under the project.
10.        Associated Bank-Funded Port Projects. The project would be associated with two Bank funded port
projects in Algeria and Morocco; both are being implemented. The Algeria Third Ports Project (Ln. 3105), is
designed to improve investment planning and programming, operational efficiency and financial viability in the port
sub-sector. The project involves the rehabilitation and upgrading of long-established ports. The Morocco Port
Sector Project (Ln. 3283/4) consists ot a component of the 1991-1993 port sector investment program as well as an
institutional development component mainly to encourage policies aimed at increasing productivity and improving
planning.

11.       Lessons from Previous Bank Projects. We do not have experience in the Region with projects dealing
with oil pollution in international waters. However, several related Bank-financed port projects have been
completed in the three Maghreb countries; they include the Arzew port project in Algeria, the Casablanca and
Mohammedia port project in Morocco and the Tunis/La Goulette port project in Tunisia. The main experience from
completed and ongoing Bank-financed projects in the ports sub-sector is that the project design needs to carefully
integrate investments with policy and institutional reforms. Under the above projects, problems in public sector
operations have shifted the Bank's focus toward creating and developing autonomous enterprises, as well as
enhancing the potential of the private sector.
12.       Rationale for GET Funding. The rationale for GET funding of the project is based on the need to
address the potential negative environmental impacts of discharged ballast and oily bilge waters, as well as
accidental oil spills, on the southwestern part of the Mediterranean, and the lack of resources to tackle this issue of
global importance. Given the competing demands of various sectors on their national budgets, it is unlikely that the
Maghreb Countries would, on their own, allocate funds for combatting the problem of marine pollution. The
availability of grant funds will reinforce the Governments' commitment to participate in reducing the risks of marine
pollution. GET funding is thus justified based on the direct and indirect capture of global benefits that such a
project will enable. In addition, it serves as a focal point for gathering and sharing technology for combatting oil
pollution.
13.       Agreed Actions. Agreements were reached during negotiations that (a) CRCP would not be abolished
or its composition and/or TOR amended without prior Bank approval; its legal structure would be reinforced and its
TOR strengthened to cope with its responsibility regarding regional cooperation; (b) local costs needed for project
implementation, operation and maintenance will be provided by each country; (c) collected oily materials will be
either re-refined, and/or treated according to appropriate and environmentally safe standards; (d) consultants' study
recommendations, regarding financial viability of the facilities and recovery of investment costs through tariffs on
ships and/or through marketing petroleum based end products would be implemented by December 31, 1995; (e)
periodic monitoring of the oil content of sea water to provide the elements for an environmental "balance sheet" on
oil pollution; a base line of data and measuring locations needed to assess the impact of the project on the
environment will be established by December 31, 1994; (f) provision of effective environmental management as
well as training to ensure a commonality of approach: (g) approval of National Contingency Plans (NCPs)
acceptable to the Bank, by the competent authority in each of the three countries will be a condition of disbursement
for equipment provided under the project; (h) cooperative agreement acceptable to the Bank between the port
authorities in the three countries defining conditions and procedures for using equipment and personnel to combat
accidental oil spills will be a condition of effectiveness of the grant agreements; and (i) each of the three grant
agreements would include a cross effectiveness clause.
14.       Environmental Aspects. The project will enhance the protection of international waters.  The
development of a regional working group will improve marine pollution management through development of a
common region-wide approach and mechanisms, as well as providing a future linkage to the Malta Center of
REMPEC. Components of the project will strengthen and promote national regulations, regulatory mechanisms and
the linkage between environmental monitoring and management. Port reception facilities will meet current national
and international standards for operation and quality of effluent. The recovery of oily materials to be re-refined or
used as bulk fuels, will take place in concert with local and national waste management programs. An
environmental analysis is being carried out by the consultants to introduce techniques that would ensure that oil and
mud disposal are handled in an environmentally safe manner. This would include: (a) adding a suitable percentage
of the oil recovered from the deballasting stations to the crude oil before its refining; and (b) refining oil recovered
from bilge water tanks to produce lubricant oil with standard specifications. Accordingly, as the proposed project
will have an overall positive impact on the Mediterranean sea, it has been classified as category "B". Environment
assessment of the project is presented in Part 11.
15.       Project Benefits. The project would contribute to efficient cooperation within each country and within
the region to control oil pollution and detect any ship or tanker not abiding by the local laws and international
conventions related to marine oil pollution prevention. It would improve each country's capability to deal with
accidental oil spills and provide equipment and facilities to collect and treat oily ballast and bilge waters thus



- 5 -
reducing hydrocarbon contamination in the Mediterranean. A base line of data and measuring locations outside
agreed ports will be established to assess the impact of the project on improving the quality of Mediterranean
waters. The project would lay the foundation for permanent cooperation in the region in termns of monitoring and
compliance auditing, state of marine pollution reporting, and a common approach for spill response. The above
benefits are difficult to evaluate in monetary and economic terms especially in terms of the impacts of accidental oil
spills.
16.       Risk. The project would not pose any specific technical risk. However, the main risk to project
implementation is related to the Governments' willingness to maintain their cooperation, to enforce the terms of the
NCPs as well as the cooperative agreement (para. 14), enforce regulations which deal with marine pollution
problems, and implement adequate cost recovery. This risk would be mitigated by: (a) current commitment of the
three Governments to follow up on the preparation study and implement studies recommendations related to the
above aspects, and the project components as defined in para.8 above and in the Technical Annexes (para. 4.02 and
4.03); (b) the national and regional benefits resulting from project implementation and future sector lending
operations, especially the follow up on environmental investments needed for coastal and ports protection; and (c)
existence of advanced drafts of the National Contingency Plans and the cooperative agreement for combatting oil
spills. Also, comprehensive project preparation has been carried out with the cooperation of local authorities,
CRCP members, and the consultants financed through the PPAs. The Bank follow up effort would be intensive to
ensure maximum success of project implementation during the various stages of the project (para. 9).

OIL POLLUTION MANAGEMENT PROTECT
FOR THE SOUTHWEST MEDITERRANEAN SEA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01           The seas and oceans of the world are used by many countries as a dumping ground for
wastes, and most noticeable are the large quantities of oil, tar and garbage that can be found around the
coastlines of many countries. The damage to the marine environment from other waste products, such
as chemicals and sewage, may be less obvious to the casual observer but can cause serious damage to
marine life. The polluters consider the sea as a free resource; they do not pay to use it or for the damage
they cause. The cost is borne by the communities and nations who pay for the cleaning of their beaches,
have to live with the polluted waters, and face the loss of fishing stocks, as well as by the world
community at large whose marine environment is becoming more polluted and less diverse.
1.02           Since the transportation of oil by sea became common in the earlier part of the century,
oil pollution has been a recognized hazard, especially in ports and enclosed sea areas. Between the two
world wars, many countries introduced measures to restrict the discharge of oil within their territorial
waters, and to provide deterrents, usually in the form of fines, for illegal discharges. When empty, a
tanker needs to take on ballast to maintain its stability and to keep its propellers and a sufficient amount
of rudder area below the water line. This ballast is almost invariably sea water, and is taken into tanks
that had previously held oil. The surfaces of these tanks are generally fouled with oil and tar deposits,
and the tank bottoms contain sludge consisting of oil, sand, and other debris. Consequently, when the
ballast water is discharged prior to reloading, pollution is left in the ships' path.
1.03           Much of this pollution is migratory in nature. Environmental damage which occurs in
a country's coastal zone can therefore often be attributed to external sources. Likewise, pollution caused
by the maritime industries in a particular nation does frequently harm the littoral environment in
neighboring countries. Thus, a regional approach to marine pollution containment is necessary. The first
such action was taken for the Baltic Sea in the early 1970s and much effort went into a similar
undertaking for the North Sea during the 1980s. Presently, several initiatives are being taken for other
bodies of water around the globe. However, the experience to date with coordinated marine pollution
abatement programs has been fraught with problems. While a host of international pollution control
conventions has come into existence during the last 15 years and have been ratified by most maritime
nations, compliance remains poor and haphazard. What appears to be a lack of commitment can
frequently be traced back to conflicting national laws and regulations, and ill-defined institutional
responsibilities.
1.04           After the second world war, the transport of oil by sea escalated rapidly, amongst
growing concern about oil pollution. A conference was organized by the United Kingdom in 1954 which
resulted in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. The 1954
Convention prohibited the disposal, within 50 miles of land, of water used to clean ships' tanks while the
ship is travelling, and also required contracting parties to take appropriate steps to promote the provision
of reception facilities for oily washing and ballast waters. Between 1958 and 1971 several amendments
were made to the 1954 Convention, including its extension to cover oily wastes from machinery spaces



- 2 -
(bilge water) of all ships above 500 grt. Due to the enormous increase in oil transport, the growth in the
size of tankers, the increase in the carriage by sea of chemicals and other noxious substances, (both by
tankers and cargo ships), the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
(MARPOL 73/78) was adopted in 1973 to deal with all forms of marine pollution from ships. The
technical measures of the Convention are dealt with in Annexes 1 to 5. They contain a wide number of
requirements, but only Annex 1 is relevant to this project; it entered into force in October 1983 and
stipulates that:
(a)   The discharge of oil is completely forbidden in designated "special areas". These
include the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Red Sea, the Black Sea, the Gulf areas,
the Gulf of Aden, and the Antarctic area. However, this is only in force in the
Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea (all from 1/1/77) and the
Antarctic area (from 13/3/92);
(b)   Oil tankers must be constructed and equipped so as to allow the ballast water to
settle, and the water at the bottom slowly drawn out and discharged to the ocean,
with constant monitoring to ensure that its oil content remains below the limit set
by the Convention. The oil that rises to the surface is transferred to a slop tank
where it is retained temporarily on board; and
(c)   Parties to the Convention must ensure that facilities are provided for the
reception of oily wastes and residues at oil terminals, receiving ports, and ship
repair facilities.
1.05           MARPOL 73/78 is the keystone for the protection of the marine environment. It strictly
limits, and in sensitive areas prohibits, ships from discharging wastes (oils, sewage, chemicals and
garbage) into the sea. They must be retained on board and discharged into properly designed waste
reception facilities at their first port of call. Ships trading with the countries that have ratified the
Convention, including Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, must be equipped with holding tanks for oils and
chemicals, and garbage storage facilities. In practice, the cost of re-fitting the national fleet is an
unavoidable one which must be borne by the ship owners; they must be modified if they are to trade with
any signatories of the Convention. This applies to all types of vessels including oil tankers, cruise ships
and even small yachts and other pleasure craft. On shore, signatories to MARPOL 73/78 must provide
reception facilities for each type of waste. In most ports of the developing countries, the immediate need
is to provide holding tanks for the reception and treatment of oily and chemical wastes and contaminated
ballast water. The largest and most expensive tanks are required for the ballast water contaminated by
oils and chemicals. Once on shore the oils are separated out from the waste waters; some can be treated
and sold for reuse while heavy tar residues can be safely placed in a land fill.
IL. BACKGROUND
2.01            The Mediterranean is a semi-enclosed sea that suffers from  serious environmental
degradation. The Mediterranean basin, which gave rise to some of the greatest civilizations in the world,
remains the center with 18 countries sharing its coastline, and a total population of about 350 million
people engaging in various patterns of economic, cultural and ethnic activities. It is a few of the
economic activities that are putting the environmental quality in the Mediterranean increasingly at risk.
The annual amount of pollutants entering that sea is well in excess of the natural purification/recycling



capacity of the water basin; in other words, it is above the level that the ecosystem can absorb without
risk. The harbors and coastal waters are polluted by industrial effluent and urban sewage, and its
international waters by ship discharges of oily ballast and bilge waters. Consequently, the Mediterranean
ranks most prominently in terms of oil pollution among the seas of the world. With an area representing
only 0.7 percent of the global water surface, the Mediterranean accounts for 17 percent of the world's
oil pollution of the seas. Organized periodic surveys reveal that surface slicks are present in more than
ten percent of the observations made throughout the region. Such data, when compared with similar
surveys made in other seas, provide evidence of relatively extensive surface pollution in the
Mediterranean. The average concentration of tar in the surface water of the Mediterranean is 38
mg/sq.m, ten times higher than the next worst afflicted sea (Kuroshio, east of Japan) and 15 times higher
than that of the northwest Atlantic; the average for all oceans is 0.8 mg/sq.m. Surveys of hydrocarbon
contamination show that the waters off the North African coast of the southwestern section of the
Mediterranean have a very high incidence of tar balls. An estimated 30% of the dumped oil becomes
tar residues on the beaches of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, directly affecting tourism and coastal
fisheries in these countries.
2.02            The southwest Mediterranean has thus far been spared major oil or other toxic cargo
tanKer accidents, but there is a high level of risk. Oil traffic along the Maghreb coast is estimated at 150
million tons annually, carried by 1,500 tankers. (Oil traffic through the Suez Canal in 1990, 1991 and
1992 is given in Tables I to 6). Luckily there has only been, on average about one accident per year
over the last decade, but this low number of incidents is considered a rare exception. Accidents off the
Algeria, Moroccan and Tunisian coasts during the last ten years are given in tables 7, 8 and 9
respectively. Other regional seas had a heavy share of tanker accidents with catastrophic environmental
consequences. The worry is that no country around the Mediterranean is prepared for dealing effectively
with such catastrophes, should they occur. The environmental risks to the Mediterranean could be
reduced by providing appropriate infrastructure for receiving and treating ship wastes, but Algeria,
Morocco and Tunisia lack adequate response facilities.  They also have insufficient well trained
personnel, and inadequate field and laboratory facilities for assessing and monitoring oil pollution.
Overall, the potential risk that the petroleum shipping traffic represents to the Mediterranean environment
is heightened by the region's lack of capacity to plan for, and respond to, oil spills.
2.03            Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia face environmental problems typical of both developing
and developed countries, and in that respect are representative of middle income countries in general, and
of several countries in the Mediterranean region. The problem of oil pollution is particularly acute in
ports and along coastal areas where major economic development is located, eg., tourism and fisheries,
in addition to threatening damage to natural resources. The three countries have become increasingly
concerned by the threat posed by environmental degradation to their quality of life and to their economic
systems. Efforts to deal with environmental problems through domestic programs and coordinated action
plans at the regional level have intensified. A conference organized by UNEP in Barcelona in 1975 led
to the adoption of the Mediterranean Action Plan and to the convention on the Protection of the
Mediterranean Sea against pollution. Numerous other resolutions, protocols, and action plans have been
produced since the Barcelona conference to focus on specific issues, reflecting the seriousness with which
the problems are viewed. The status of national contingency plans for Mediterranean countries is given
in Table 10. A summary of international conventions and regulatory provisions for controlling marine
pollution by oil is provided in Annex l.
2.04            In order to avoid major negative economic impacts that would jeopardize their
development and welfare, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia will have to reduce the environmental risks



associated with sea transport of oil by taking responsibility for protecting their own marine environment
from accidental spills and unauthorized discharges. However, as previously mentioned, the majority of
their harbors, lack adequate equipment to combat even a minor spill. The current situation requires
immediate actions and measures to rehabilitate existing deballasting stations and provide harbors with
equipment to deal with spills.
2.05           Algeria, with more than 1,200 kilometers (km) of coastline on the Mediterranean, has
10 principal commercial ports along its coastline. Its oil exports in 1992 reached 67 million tons (Table
11), of which 30.4 million tons were crude oil and 13.2 million tons were refined products. The four
major ports that handle hydrocarbons exports need extensive rehabilitation of their deballasting facilities,
especially those at Arzew. Other Algerian ports have no reception facilities for handling oily waste and
bilge water. Morocco, with a 3,500 km coastline on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic ocean, has
several major commercial ports on each coast. Among its 21 ports (including seven major ports), only
Mohammedia has a modern reception and treatment facilities to handle ballast and bilge waters. The total
oil traffic passing through Moroccan ports is about 9.23 million tons (Table 12). Tunisia's 1,200 km
coastline on the Mediterranean, with its attractive tourist and recreational facilities, provides the country
with an important source of income. Tunisia's ports, seven of which are considered major ports, handle
about 5.4 million tons of crude oil each year (Table 13). The two deballasting stations at Bizerte port
and Skhira Oil Terminal near Gabes are operating adequately and need no rehabilitation, however,
productivity of Bizerte station could be improved by providing training to its personnel. The collection,
management, and environmentally sound disposal of wastes are also becoming serious problems in areas
where leisure crafts and cruise ships abound. Port systems in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia are shown
in the attached maps, IBRD 25218, 25219 and 25220.
2.06           Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia are parties to the Barcelona Convention (1976) on
combatting oil spills, as well as to the MARPOL 73/78 Convention regarding discharge of ship wastes.
The three countries recognize that a common approach would be beneficial in addressing petroleum
hydrocarbon pollution. Each country has shown a willingness to proceed with the regional and national
components of the proposed project. The three governments have requested GET and IBRD assistance
in developing an oil pollution management project for the southwest Mediterranean sea. Efficiency would
be achieved through shared equipment and facilities, as well as common training exercises.
111. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND INSTITUTIONS
A. Algeria
3.01           Environmental Policy. Since its independence, Algeria has given priority to industrial
development but has paid little attention to conserving its natural resources or to the environmental
degradation that resulted from unregulated promotion of its industrial sector. Studies by local scientists
revealed the nature and extent of pollution and its impact on the economy and well being of the
population. Based on the studies' conclusions, the Government passed environmental legislation in 1983
and organized a national seminar on "The Environment and the Management of Natural Resources" in
1983. The seminar issued a set of guidelines and adopted an action plan for the protection of the
environment. The objectives of the 1985 action plan were not achieved because the plan failed to indicate
costs of proposed actions,prioritize such actions according to cost-effective criteria, outline enforcement
mechanisms to be put in place and explicitly allocate budget resources for those actions. In search of a
new environmental policy framework, an environmental action plan dealing with medium-to-long term



- 5 -
objectives and the development of an integrated national environment management framework while it
moves towards liberalization and a market economy, the Government is now being assisted by the Bank
to identify the main environmental priorities and define policy options for reducing pollution and
conserving natural resources. It acknowledges that the time has come to assess pollution and that,
therefore, a better information collection and monitoring system is needed together with strengthened
institutions and a refined legal framework.
3.02           Institutions. Up to 1989 the environment had been the responsibility of several bodies.
The Ministry of Hydraulics, now part of the Ministry of Equipment, was in charge of conserving natural
resources and reducing pollution. The "Direction des Parcs Naturels et de la Protection de la Faune et
de la Flore" and "Direction de la Lutte contre la Pollution et les Nuisances "(DLPN) and its executing
agency "Agence Nationale pour la Protection de l'Environnement (ANPE), created in 1983 as a semi-
autonomous institution, dealt with specific environmental functions at the national and international levels.
The Ministry of Interior (MI) was involved in environmental activities even when responsibilities were
shared with other institutions, i.e., Ministry of Agriculture, and "Agence pour la Conservation de la
Nature" (ANA). In addition there are several other institutions involved in environmental management
such as, "Agence Nationale des Ressources Hydrauliques" (ANRH), the "Institut des Sciences de la Mer
et de l'Amenagement du Littoral" (ISMAL), the "Direction de l'Amenagement du Territoire" (DAT), and
the "Agence Nationale pour l'Amenagement du Territoire" (ANAT).
3.03           In 1989, a new institutional arrangement for environmental management was set up and
transferred the responsibilities for environmental management to the MI. The DLPN became the
"Direction de l'Environnement" (DDE).  The DDE received wider power and took on more
responsibilities. Its mandate was to define the policy to protect the environment, coordinate the actions
of the other ministries involved, and oversee the conformity of new economic activities to the existing
environmental protection standards. It was helped in its task by a corps of inspectors who exercised their
technical and regulatory functions under DDE direct control while its administration was under ANPE
control. ANPE identifies, prepares, and implements projects of a technical and scientific nature, and:
(a) carries out studies and prepares rules and regulations on pollution control; (b) prepares and executes
emergency plans; and (c) creates and operates sampling stations to monitor water and air pollution. It
is also responsible for training, education and dissemination of information. A council of representatives
from all ministries approve ANPE's plans and projects, and a scientific committee advises it on technical
issues.
3.04           In 1991, the sector was again reorganized, DDE was transferred to the Ministere de
l'Education Nationale (MEN) and became responsible mainly for regulation, norms, and control and
prevention. ANPE has been put under the supervision of the new Secrdtariat d'Etat A la Recherche
Scientifique created in 1992, which became "Ministere delegu6 aux Universites et a la Recherche
Scientifique" in 1993, under the MEN. However, it is not yet clear if the new institutional arrangement
is coordinating the activities of the numerous institutions, described above, involved in environmental
management. Additional investigation and studies are being carried out, under ongoing dialogue with
the Bank, to establish and coordinate the necessary mechanism and activities and to better define the
institutional objectives.
3.05           Regulatory Framework. Algeria has various institutions as stated above, and several
laws and regulations which deal with environmental protection. The major legal text is the law regarding
environmental protection adopted by the National Assembly in February 1983 which expresses three
principles: (a) protection of the environment is part of the socio-economic development strategy; (b)



- 6-
equilibrium between economic objectives and protection of the environment; and (c) all technical and
regulatory aspects of projects should be defined in the context of regional development.
3.06           The above law covers several aspects of environmental protection such as: flora and
fauna, national parks and natural resources, water pollution, contamination of the ocean, etc. It includes
chapters on the study of environmental impacts and procedures and systems of enforcement. It foresees
the creation of an Environment Fund as recommended under the national budget laws promulgated in
1992 and 1993, and a special corps of environmental inspectors and controllers, set up in 1988, with
power over local authorities, but it does not specify how the enforcement of penalties is to be financed.
The law requires the promulgation of several implementing decrees (eighty), some of which (twenty five)
have already been promulgated such as the creation of ANPE, the creation of the above mentioned corps
of inspectors and controllers along with definition of their responsibilities, preparation of environmental
impact assessment studies, notification and regulation of the transport of hazardous substances, collection
and disposal of urban solid waste and the establishment of national parks, etc. Additional implementing
decrees related to pollution in general and to oil pollution management in particular were published in
1993, i.e, regulation of industrial and bilge oil disposal, collection and treatment of oil materials and
lubricants, definition of pollution level standards for surface water and beaches, regulation of atmospheric
pollution, obligation of ships to declare carriage of dangerous and toxic materials, and intervention of the
coast guard in case of pollution at sea. Two major legislative texts dealing with accidental oil pollution,
a National Contingency Plan (NCP) and a cooperative agreement with Morocco and Tunisia are also
being prepared by the Algerian authorities.
3.07           Tn addition, Algeria has signed several international and regional conventions, including
the 1976 Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution, the 1969
Brussels convention on intervention on the high seas in case of oil pollution casualties, the 1971 Brussels
convention on creation of an international fund to cover damage caused by oil pollution, the 1972 and
1973 London convention and its annexes for prevention of pollution from ships (MARPOL 1973/78), and
the Maghreb charters dealing with cooperation in the maritime domain (Annex 1).
B. Morocco
3.08           Environmental Policy. Protection of the environment is a part of the socio-economic
development process in Morocco. The overall objective of the policy is to implement a more dynamic
national strategy which would balance international constraints with national priorities to achieve mid and
long term sustainable development. This strategy consists of six major activities: a) identification of the
current environment status and evolution; b) formulation of an appropriate legal framework in accordance
with Moroccan needs, and implementation of control and assistance systems; c) strengthening
coordination between state and private institutions at the regional and national levels in order to improve
environmental management and tackle environmental problems; d) defining incentives and encouraging
implementation of pilot environmental projects locally and nationwide; e) promoting training and
education of the public about environmental protection; and f) strengthening and enhancing institutional
cooperation at the national and regional levels in order to gain better control over the effects on the
environment.
3.09           Institutions.  During the  last two decades, environmental management was the
responsibility of several institutions (Ministries) based on their specific environmental activities. As a
consequence, lateral coordination is limited, except in the event of emergencies or national crises.
Efficient participation of the various ministries in the country's environmental management activities has



been difficult because they do not have the means nor appropriate structure or organization, and their
mandates to actively participate in managing and protecting the environment are not clearly defined. The
major institutions which play some role in specific areas of environmental management and control are
Public Works (water resources management), Agriculture (soil degradation, deforestation), Public Health
(health environment), Trade and Industry (industrial pollution), and Energy and Mining (mining and
energy pollution). Morocco also has several laboratories, private and public, adequately equipped, but
limited to analyzing physical and chemical parameters of water with no capacity for toxicologic
evaluations and chemical analysis.
3.10           The environment entities in Morocco have experienced several changes over the years,
the latest was the Government's decision creating the Sous-Secretariat pour la Protection de
l'Environnement (SSEPE), under the Ministry of Interior and of Information (MIu), to ensure better
environmental management through appropriate coordination and implementation of an adequate action
plan. The SSEPE is the main central environment agency of the country responsible for making policies,
drafting regulations, and setting up monitoring and enforcement systems. The actual role devoted to this
institution will allow it to mobilize human and technical capabilities to carry out certain environmental
activities, i.e. conserve natural resources, prevent environmental degradation, provide limited technical
advice and coordinate national and international environmental activities. In addition, a National Council
of Environment does exist with a consultative mandate. Its structure includes all national competencies
and sectorial institutions such as the Government Council on Water and National Forest Council whose
roles are crucial in managing the environmental sector.
3.11           The SSEPE employs two long term environmental advisors financed by Germany and
UNDP to prepare environmental policies and strategies for the country. New institutional developments
are going on which include establishment of the Central Environmental Laboratory totally financed by
Germany, preparation of an environmental strategy in Morocco financed by UNDP, and creation of an
environmental impact assessment unit funded by METAP to prepare national procedures for the
preparation of environmental impact assessments. Beyond these activities however, the need to improve
the poor profile of the environmental infrastructure, clearly define the responsibilities for pollution control
and strengthen the capacity for policy making, setting standards, monitoring, intervention and
enforcement are urgently needed.
3.12           Regulatory Framework.  The regulatory framework in Morocco includes several
important laws and legal texts addressing protection of the environment. However, their common
characteristic is that they are, for the most part, outdated. In addition, implementation of the regulation
texts and regulatory enforcement is particularly weak. The Moroccan Government is planning to
consolidate its environmental legislation by preparing and adopting the missing regulations and texts, for
example the law on the major aspects of environmental protection, the maritime code, industrial
investment code, mining code and contingency plans for combatting oil pollution. Morocco has signed
several international and regional conventions and agreements including the Maghreb Charter dealing with
cooperation in the Maritime domain, the 1972 London Convention for prevention of marine pollution by
dumping wastes from ships and aircraft into the sea, the 1973/78 MARPOL Convention for prevention
of pollution from ships, and Brussels conventions. A NCP and a cooperative agreement with Algeria and
Tunisia are being prepared by the Moroccan authorities.



C. Tunisia
3.13           Environmental Policy. Most of Tunisia's environmental problems result from the day
to day operations of enterprises, institutions and households. The government intends to implement
strategies and actions that would reduce the risk of major environmental hazards, stop the major causes
of pollution, and formulate the basis for strong institutional and legal framework permitting better
environmental management and law enforcement. Due to the complexity and variety of environmental
problems, the action plan is defined as parts of a whole process of adjustments, improvements, and
sensitization in which all parts of Tunisian society interact and reach an agreement. It includes measures
to be taken at the national/sectoral level to be launched simultaneously with urgent measures as defined
in four major environmental protection programs. First, the ten year action plan for water and soil
conservation intends to consolidate anti-erosion measures for one million ha and create 1,000 hillside
lakes. Second, the forestry program will permit development of 20,000 ha of forest strips, protection
of 700,000 ha of forest, and reforestation of about 300,000 ha over a ten year period. Third, a national
strategy to combat desertification attempts to integrate the actions mentioned in the first two programs
into the economic and social development of the central and southern region of the country. Fourth, a
national action program for environmental protection aims to fight pollution, preserve the quality of life
of urban and rural populations, protect the marine environment and beaches, preserve the country's
archeological heritage and encourage the participation of the population in efforts to protect the
environment.
3.14           The basic Government orientation in the sector is articulated around: (a) the idea of
integrating Tunisia's development into the Maghreb, European and Mediterranean arenas, and (b)
preserving the dynamic characteristics of the region by adequate use of its space, and natural and human
resources. This policy would support private sector development and improvement of less developed
regions. It would require a series of actions that adapt production capability to environmental protection
requirements.
3.15           The Tunisian global and multi-dimensional approach to environmental policy is based
on three principal ideas: (a) containment of pollution and deterioration of the environment within
acceptable limits, defined by monitoring standards, and curative measures based on elimination, reduction
and/or collection of waste materials in order to repair environment damage; (b) management of the
utilization of the natural environment for economic purposes in such a way as to guarantee the renewal
of all resources that are consumed; and (c) establishment of measures to protect and valorize all aspects
of natural or man-made sites which are threatened by deterioration. This approach favors the preventive
actions based on enforcement of environmental impact assessments and implementation of emergency
plans to solve current major environmental issues in selected regions. At the same time it recognizes the
importance of incentive measures by providing subsidies, soft loans and tax exemptions in order to
develop depollution activities and/or protecting the environment through appropriate investments.
3.16           Institutions. The responsibility for environmental management and implementation of
a national environmental policy is basically within the "Ministere de l'Environnement et de
l'Amenagement du Territoire" (MEAT); other horizontal, regional and local structures are also involved
in environmental management.
3.17           MEAT was created in October 1991, and consists of a Ministerial Department and two
agencies, "Agence Nationale de Protection de l'Environnement" (ANPE) created in 1988 and "Office
National de l'Assainissement" (ONAS) created in 1973. The first agency, ANPE, had its responsibilities



- 9 -
expanded in 1992 to include two missions: a mission consisting of analyzing the status of environment
in the country and control its evolution, and a mission to combat all sources of pollution of the natural
environment. ANPE conducts diagnostic studies all over the country in order to meet its two mission'
requirements and ensure better quality of life for the people. It approves the environmental impact
analyses of all new industrial, commercial and agriculture projects with a potential negative impact on
the environment and monitors emissions of pollutants and promotes research, education, and information
dissemination within the field of environmental protection. In addition, ANPE has the power to sue
polluters in order to repair damage caused to the environment. The second agency, ONAS, created in
1974, is responsible for the planning, construction, and operation of the sewer system in the country.
It is the principal actor in combatting water pollution and protecting water resources. Its activities cover
the whole country, including industrial and touristic areas. In addition, ONAS provides assistance to
local commnunities for solid waste management and rainfall.
3.18           Unlike the institutions described above which have sectorial and national responsibilities,
others have responsibilities limited to specific activities, such as forestry (Direction des Forats), urban
rehabilitation (ARRU), water and soil conservation (SONEDE, Direction des Sols, Direction de la
Conservation des Eaux et des Sols) and energy conservation (Agence de Conservation de l'Energie,
STEG), and they tend to be more operational in terms of environmental activity. Some have institutional
capabilities and adequate resources; others are production oriented and consequently are also contributors,
directly or indirectly to the degradation of the environment, at the same time as they have responsibility
for environment quality within their area of activity. Besides this category of institutions there are
support institutions which do not have specific environmental mandates but which are, or can be, of great
support to overall environmental activity e.g., the Institut National de la Meteorology (IMM), the Institut
National de l'Arch6ologie et des Arts (INAA), the Institut National Scientifique et Technique
d'Oceanographie et de Peche (INSTOP), the Institut Pasteur, the Faculte de Droit, etc. They are able
to carry out environmental research, studies, and tasks at the request of the sectorial institutions.
3.19           RegLlatory Framework. Various instruments are used in Tunisia for environmental
management, but mainly the legislative framework. The legal framework for environmental management
in Tunisia however, has three main negative characteristics: (a) lack of global and integrated juridical
approach to environmental protection; (b) weak coordination among various bodies in charge of
environmental legislation; and (c) inadequate coherent enforcement of environmental legislation. These
weaknesses are being tackled on the basis of actions and recommendations stated in the Country
Environmental Study and National Action Plan issued in 1989. An environmental educational and
sensitization program was started in 1990 and needs more time for adequate evaluation. Since 1988,
Tunisia has been developing a legal framework for urban environmental management (law 88/91) which
introduced some innovative elements in terms of environmental management, it includes: (a) pollution
control; (b) procedures for environmental impact assessment; (c) punitive sanctions to safeguard the
environment; (d) regulations for used oil and lubricant collection and treatment; and (e) incentives to
encourage clean-up. In addition MEAT is preparing a national contingency plan and a cooperative
agreement with Algeria and Morocco for combatting accidental oil spills and marine pollution. Tunisia
has signed, as Algerian and Morocco did, several regional and international conventions and agreements
including the Maghreh Charter (Annex 1).

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01            Algeria, Morocco  and Tunisia, with  limited  exceptions, lack the appropriate
infrastructure to provide and monitor compliance with international conventions related to marine
pollution by oil. National or regional capability to assess and monitor oil pollution is limited both in field
and laboratory facilities as well as in available personnel (para. 2.02). Furthermore, none of the three
countries now possess meaningful national or regional oil spill contingency planning or response
capabilities. The proposed project contains all the elements of a comprehensive approach to the
management of oil pollution by marine sources. It focuses on intervention and developing the institutional
capability to improve the well-being of the people by improving the quality of coastal waters and beaches,
as well as potentially improve the marine productivity of the region. The primary objectives of the
proposed project are thus to reduce the quantity of petroleum hydrocarbons entering the international
waters of the Mediterranean and to comply with MARPOL 73/78 Convention requirements (para. 1.04).
B. Project Components
4.02            The project consists of two main components: (a) national elements; and (b) regional
elements.
(a)   National Elements. The national elements include the following:
(i)     Port reception facilities: The central element of the national component
will be the upgrading of deballasting facilities in the ports of Arzew
(Algeria) and Mohammedia (Morocco) and improving the operational
efficiency of deballasting station in the port of Bizerte (Tunisia) to receive
and handle ballast waters (which are mostly water) and bilge waters
(which have a higher concentration of oil), and constructing additional
facilities to receive and store, for subsequent transport, waste oils and
related products (materials which have a low water content). Ballast water
treatment facilities are proposed for the above ports based on their
handling of the largest proportion of oil imports and/or exports. Although
Mohammedia is located on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, it is the origin
or destination of many vessels in the Mediterranean and would provide the
best working example for Morocco, especially since bilge water and waste
oil reception facilities will eventually be established in other commercial
ports.
(ii)  In Algeria, the project will include construction of sheds to store floating
booms, dispersant, skimmer heads, accessories, etc, construction of three
VTS stations at Algiers, Skikda and Arzew; rehabilitation of a deballasting
station at Arzew; provision of equipment for four laboratories at Algiers,
Bejaia, Skikda and Arzew; provision of equipment and dispersant to
combat oil spills; and training. In Morocco, it will include construction
of sheds to store floating booms, dispersant, skimmer heads, accessories,
etc, rehabilitation of Mohammedia deballasting station, provision of
equipment and dispersant to combat oil spills, and training. In Tunisia,



- 11 -
it will include construction of sheds to store floating booms, dispersant,
skimmer heads, accessories, etc, provision of equipment and dispersant to
combat oil spills, and training. VTS stations are provided only in Algeria
because Morocco and Tunisia either have an adequate number or planning
to construct some.  Details of equipment to combat oil spills and
dispersant are given in Table 14 for Algeria, Table 15 for Morocco and
Table 16 for Tunisia;
(iii)    The recovered oily materials will be transported to one or two central
processing facilities within each country and/or to other countries. During
negotiations. assurances were obtained from the three Governments that
collected oil materials will be sold before or after re-refininz or treated
using an environmentally sound arrangement acceptable to the Bank as a
means of making the proposed project self-sustaining. This will maximize
the cost-effectiveness of the treatment/processing centers and will ensure
higher quality environmental monitoring of the treatment process. The
proposed project includes setting up of a mechanism to provide a means
of monitoring effluent quality, as well as comparing data on types and
quantities of products treated to ensure compliance with MARPOL 73/78
Convention. During ngotiations. assurances were obtained from the three
Governments that. by December 31. 1996. effluent will meet current
international 2uidelines stipulated in MARPOL 73/78 Convention. A base
line of data and measuring locations needed to assess the impact of the
project on improving the quality of sea water will be established before
December 31. 1994 by the Port Directorate in Algeria. ODEP in Morocco
and OPNT in Tunisia in designated areas agreed upon with the Bank.
Each of the three countries has private and public laboratories (universities
and institutions) capable of carrying out the required analysis of sea water.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from each of the three
Governments that the DP, ODEP and OPNT would contract prior to
December 31, 1994 under TOR acceptable to the Bank a laboratory
accentable to the Bank to carry out above analysis and produce a report
on the findings of the analysis every three months;
(iv)  Oil spill contingency plan: The second of the national elements will be the
development and implementation of oil spill contingency and
environmental sensitivity plans and, from these, oil spill response plans
will be implemented. These plans will incorporate the concept of risk
assessment to identify and prioritize elements at both the port and national
levels.  Technical assistance (including training), provided under the
project will ensure a commonality of approach and methodologies. Risk
assessment will also be used to prioritize the investments in spill response
and clean-up equipment. Each of the three governments is now finalizing
a National Contingency Plan (NCP) to deal with oil spills. During
negotiations. an agreement was reached that adoption of NCPs acceptable
to the Bank, by the competent authority in each of the three countries
would be a condition of disbursement for equipment to combat oil spills
financed under the project



- 12 -
(v)   Oil spill response equipment: Since the Mediterranean is notably void of
effective contingency arrangements or oil spill combatting equipment, and
since there is very limited cooperation at the regional level, any accident
of even modest dimension would result in disastrous consequences for the
environment. The 1969 Brussels International Convention relating to
Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualty (1975)
gives a coastal state the right to intervene, however, only after an
accidental oil spill has occurred and there is a grave and eminent danger
of pollution of its coastline or territorial waters. The proposed project will
provide quick and concerted response to any navigation accident in ports,
oil terminals, territorial waters or high seas. The framework for the
required  response  arrangements  will  include  institutional  and
organizational responsibilities, required communication networks,
modalities for activating response procedures, documentation of actions
taken, and liaison provisions. The ingredients of the national oil spill
response plans under the proposed project include: (a) preparation of a
strategy for pollution clean-up and selection of clean-up techniques; (b)
provision of a well established stock of equipment for combatting oil spills
and for dispersing pollutants as well as adequate manpower, both in
number and experience; (c) provision of sufficient transport equipment to
ensure a high level of mobility for pollution clean-up teams; and (d)
provision of suitable facilities for storage and ultimate disposal of retained
pollutants. An outline of methods for combatting oil spills at sea is given
in Annex 2; and
(vi)        Monitoring and compliance: The regulatory mechanism will consist of two
elements: (i) monitoring capability; and (ii) an environmental management
framework. The monitoring element will consist of investments in select
national laboratories to provide or upgrade analytical capabilities to
monitor and audit port, coastal and adjacent international waters. Where
necessary, these investments will include staff training and provision of
auxiliary equipment for sample analysis. The environmental management
element will strengthen the technical elements of port and national
regulations, by developing mechanisms for cost recovery and financial
sustainability, and promoting compliance by ship owners.  During
negotiations. each of the three governments were committed to implement
consultants recommendations in this regard before December 31. 1995.
In each case, the CRCP will work closely with national and port units to
ensure a commonality of approach and mechanisms to control regulation
and non-compliance by shipping companies. This element will serve in
future as a model for other national elements of environmental regulation
(e.g., air pollution).
4.03            (b) Regional Elements.  Three specific programs will be undertaken to provide a
multilateral framework so that national plans can be developed within a common approach:
(i)     Regional oil spill environmental sensitivity and contingency plans: These
plans will serve primarily as a template for national and local plans and,



- 13 -
secondly, to link the national plans of the three countries. Elements of the
plans will include appropriate responses to protect sensitive coastal
resources, analysis of impacts on alternate water users, and potential for
transport of spilled product to other local or foreign ports. The elements
identified in the sensitivity/contingency plans would be prioritized using
a risk assessment approach to derive a regional spill response plan as well
as priority investments in equipment and training. These plans will
include spill transport modelling, linkage of equipment and manpower to
regional needs and identification of external sources of assistance. Part of
this task will be to ensure equipment purchased under the project is the
same throughout the three countries, and to undertake training courses and
joint exercises. These will further promote the concept of a regional
approach for spill response. In addition to the condition that should be
fulfilled before disbursing on equipment procured to combat accidental oil
spills (para. 4.02 (iv)), agreement was reached during negotiations that
signing a joint cooperative agreement acceptable to the Bank between the
ports of Algiers. Arzew. Bejaia and Skikda (Algeria). ODEP (Morocco)
and OPNT (Tunisia). defining the conditions and procedures for using all
available equipment and personnel to combat accidental oil spills. would
be a condition of effectiveness of the three grant agreements. The
cooperative agreement will identify responsibilities in case of accidental
oil spills regarding exchange of information, mobilizing of equipment,
actions by each party etc. Basic principals of a regional policy of
cooperation in the management of accidental oil spills is outlined in Annex
3;
(ii)    Training:  Training needs have been identified for those who will be
responsible for combatting oil spills, control of navigation traffic,
deballasting stations, and oil terminals. Details of training policy and
requirements are given in Annex 4. A three year training program has
been prepared to train 148 people from Algeria, 185 from Morocco and
137 from  Tunisia, totalling 470.  Three main groups are likely to
participate in the program: Level I includes management personnel of
port enterprises, supervising officers managing "Civil Protection" and
those responsible for the coordination of the intervention in case of an
accidental oil spill. Level II includes port officers, and "Civil Protection"
staff responsible for organizing and managing the protection of coastal
sites. Level III includes ground staff of the port enterprises and assistant
"Civil Protection" officers likely to be managing the clean-up sites or
putting the equipment into operation. Whenever possible, training will be
carried out on a regional basis so as to familiarize the personnel with
working together using the same equipment and procedures. Training that
will be carried out locally will make the fullest use of existing vocational
and technical institutions and facilities. During negotiations. assurances
were obtained from the three Governments that the DP. ODEP and OPNT
will jointly employ, prior to December 31, 1995, management consultants
acceptable to the Bank to prepare and implement the training program
under TOR agreed upon with the Bank; and



- 14 -
(iii)    Regulatory mechanism, monitoring and compliance auditing: The emphasis
is to ensure that there is not a diversion of the pollution problems to
another area of the Mediterranean. Regulatory mechanisms will focus on
the development and implementation of financial techniques to promote
compliance, while at the same time addressing the need for sustainability
of trilateral and national efforts. Regional monitoring and auditing will
center around the development of "balance sheet" auditing to link reported
quantities of wastes received and treated with results of monitoring in
national waters, adjacent international waters, and overall monitoring in
the Mediterranean. Methods will be developed for the collection and
collation of monitoring data for the purpose of preparing State of the
Marine Environment reports, both on national and regional levels. These
reports would also serve to provide a non-monetary gauge of the "net"
benefits to the environment of the GET investment.
C. Project Costs
4.04           The proposed project is estimated to cost US$20 million equivalent, including physical
and price contingencies, of which US$18.3 million equivalent in foreign currency and US$1.7 million
equivalent in local currencies (Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian). Summary of project costs is given
below and details are given in Table 17 for Algeria, Table 18 for Morocco and Table 19 for Tunisia.

4.05        The above costs are net of taxes and customs duties as the three Governments intend to
waive taxes and duties on all items included in the project. This has been confirmed during 2rants
negotiations. Base costs are estimated at expected January 1994 prices using the prevailing rates of
exchange of ALD 23.0, MOD 9.4 and TND 1 .0 for one US$. Except for the cost of project preparation
where a contract is already awarded, the average physical contingency is 5 percent of base cost. Price
contingencies were applied to base costs over the project implementation period of seven fiscal years
(1993 to 1999). Price contingencies on foreign exchange costs based on Bank projections of international
price increases were included at an average of 3.3 per cent from  FY  1994 to FY  1999.  Price
contingencies on Moroccan and Tunisian local costs were assumed at 5 per cent during the same period
given that local trends in both countries are likely to be slightly higher than international inflation trends.
However, in Algeria, local inflation based on Bank projections is assumed at 24 per cent in 1994, 20 per
cent in 1995, 19 per cent in 1996, 15 per cent in 1997, 13 per cent in 1998 and 10 per cent thereafter.
D. Project Financing
4.06        The foreign exchange cost of the project would be financed through a US$18.3 million
concessional funding secured from the GET core funds. The local exchange cost (US$1.7 million) would
be financed by Algeria (US$520,000), Morocco (US$700,000) and Tunisia (US$520,000). The local
contribution to project financing corresponds approximately to the ratios of local shipping fleets to
international fleets navigating off the coast of the three countries. Each of the three countries will provide
all local funds needed to implement. operate and maintain its part of the proiect. this has been confirmed
during negotiations. Three separate grant agreements will be signed between the Bank and; (a) the
Algerian Government for US$6.9 million equivalent; (b) ODEP (Morocco) for US$5.6 million equivalent;
and (c) the Tunisian Government for US$5.8 million equivalent. The above grant agreements include
a cross effectiveness clause.
E. Project Preparation
4.07        The Bank, acting as Trustee of the Global Environment Trust Fund, provided Algeria,
Morocco and Tunisia each with a Project Preparation Advance (PPA) of SDR200,000 (US$280,000
equivalent) to prepare the project. Copies of the three signed PPA agreements are attached as Annex 5.
A committee for project preparation and coordination (CRCP) consisting of representatives of each of the
three countries has been created to ensure homogeneity of approach, equipment and training. The three
representatives are the "Directeur des Ports" for Algeria, the "Directeur G6neral de l'Office
d'Exploitation des Ports" (ODEP) for Morocco and the "President Directeur General de l'Office des Ports
Nationaux Tunisiens", (OPNT) for Tunisia. CRCP's terms of reference (Annex 6) as agreed by the three
Governments and the Bank outline its responsibilities and provide it with the necessary authority to carry
out such responsibilities. However, its structure would be reinforced and its TOR strengthened to cope
with its responsibilities regarding regional cooperation. Because of CRCP's important role, commitments
were obtained from the three governments during negotiations that the CRCP would not be abolished.
or its composition and/or TOR amended without prior Bank approval. The CRCP jointly engaged a
consulting firm acceptable to the Bank to prepare the project. Copy of the consultants TOR is attached
as Annex 7. The consultants submitted their first phase final report in July 1993, upon the basis of which
the project was appraised in August 1993. The consultants are being paid through the PPA's and are now
preparing the second phase report as well as project tender documents.

F. Project Implementation
4.08        Each entity, the Port Directorate (Algeria), ODEP (Morocco) and OPNT (Tunisia) will be
responsible for implementing those parts of the project assigned to each of them and for procuring and
maintaining civil works and equipment financed by the project. Each of the above implementing agencies
is competent, well staffed and experienced enough to carry out their responsibilities in an efficient
manner. The CRCP will coordinate project activities with the various agencies involved in project
monitoring, especially as regards the regional elements and the regional contingency plan. Due to the
complexity of the project involving three countries, supervision will take place every three months. In
addition. a mid-term review will be carried out by December 1996 to assess the progress of project
implementation: this has been confirmed during negotiations. In order to ensure that equipment financed
under the project is manufactured and delivered in accordance with bidding documents specifications,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that by January 1995 the DP. ODEP and OPNT will jointly
employ as needed engineering consultants acceptable to the Bank under TOR agreed with the Bank to
supervise equipment manufacture, delivery and testing. Project implementation schedule is given in
Schedule 1.
G. Procurement
4.09        All equipment supply contracts will be awarded on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank
Guidelines for Procurement. Moreover, in order to ensure common operations, training and availability
of spare parts, the three governments gave assurances during negotiations that the same equipment
supplier, will be contracted jointly by the DP. ODEP and OPNT using the same technical specifications
and implementation schedule. However, in order to facilitate disbursement. separate contracts will be
signed with each of the DP. ODEP and OPNT. This procedure was successfully used when the three
governments employed the same consuiltants to prepare the project. For contracts estimated to cost less
that US$100,000 procurement will be through international shopping in which written price quotations
will be obtained from at least three qualified suppliers from a minimum of two countries. Procurement
through international shopping should not exceed a total of US$200,000 for each of the three countries.
4. 10       The costs of civil works, mainly sheds to store equipment, are estimated at US$200,000 for
each country. They will be financed locally and are not of sufficient size to attract foreign contractors.
It is thus appropriate that they would be contracted based on LCB in accordance with local procedures
acceptable to the Bank for each of the three countries. About 85 man-months of consulting services for
training (para. 4.03 (ii) and supervision of equipment manufacture, delivery and testing (para 4.08), will
be selected and engaged in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.  The
procurement categories and respective amounts, including physical and price contingencies, are shown
in Table 20. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that all contracts for items for the proiect will
be subiect to Bank prior review.
H. Disbursement and Revolving Funds
4.11        Disbursement of the GET grants totalling US$18.3 million equivalent is shown in Table 21,
separately for each grant, and jointly for the whole project. Disbursement over a seven year period
follow the Bank standard profile for the Maghreb countries. However, as most of the items included in
the project, mainly equipment supply, are relatively straightforward, the project is expected to be
completed in five years. The proceeds of the GET grants will be disbursed against seven categories:



- 18 -
(a)   equipment to combat oil spills: 100% of total expenditures;
(b)   rehabilitation of deballasting stations: 100% of total expenditures;
(c)   VTS stations: 100% of foreign expenditures;
(d)  laboratory equipment: 100% of total expenditures;
(e)  training: 100% of total expenditures; and
(f)   supervision of equipment: 100% of total expenditures;
4.12        Disbursements will be fully documented except for withdrawal applications against training,
and contracts valued at US$10,000 or less, for which Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) will be
authorized. The supporting documentation will be retained by each recipient and made available for
review by the Bank during supervision. The annual audit of the project accounts will include a separate
opinion on claims made against SOEs.
4.13        In order to facilitate payment of project expenditures and alleviate the need to prefinance
the Bank's share of financing, each of the three project implementing agencies will open a special account
in a commercial or central bank acceptable to the Bank under terms and conditions agreed with the Bank.
This has been confirmed during negotiations.  The initial deposits for the three special accounts,
representing the average four months disbursement need for the project, will be made upon request from
each project implementing agency. Deposits into, and payments out of the special accounts shall be made
in accordance with the schedule "Special Account" of the grant agreements. The disbursement schedule
shown in Table 21 assumes that the grants will be effective by June 1994 and that the project will be
completed by December 1998. The closing date will be December 31, 1999.
1. Financial Management, Accounting and Auditing Requirements
4.14        Financial Management and Accounting Procedures. The port authorities in each country
(DP in Algeria, ODEP in Morocco, and OPNT in Tunisia) will be responsible for opening and
maintaining of project accounts under each of their respective budgets; and financial management of the
related investments and operations. They will assume responsibility for preparing and consolidating all
project expenses, ensuring payments to the contractors, and preparing disbursement applications according
to their accounting practices and in accordance with accounting principles. Operating costs corresponding
to maintenance, salaries, and operation of the facilities and equipment will be financed by the port
authorities through their budget as well as resources that will be generated by the ballasting stations. Fees
and fines collected by environmental authorities and agencies from ships causing environmental damage,
including oil spills, will be deposited into Environmental Funds kept at the Treasury and used in
particular to compensate and/or cover expenses spent for combatting oil spills, and to finance subsequent
government staff training and investment for combatting oil pollution. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations on the above commitments.
4.15        Auditing. The project financial accounts, and the special account will be audited annually
by a qualified independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with internationally accepted
auditing principals. Audit reports on project accounts and utilization of GET grants, and the management
letter, will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year, along with the
detailed audit reports on the port authorities. The audit will include specific verification of the legitimacy
of all expenditures and an opinion on the reliability of the use of GET grants. It will include detailed
comments on accounting procedures for project accounts and for the special account. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the above audit will be carried out.



- 19 -
4.16        Reporting.  DP, ODEP and OPNT will each be responsible for monitoring project
implementation of national and regional elements including physical and institutional objectives. They
will prepare a semi-annual progress and mid-term review reports to be submitted to each of the three
governments and the Bank. The reports will assess progress on physical, financial, and institutional
components (para. 4.08). The DP, ODEP, and OPNT will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR)
within six months of the project completion date. During negotiations. assurances were obtained from
the three Recipients that above commitments will be met.
J. Associated Bank-Funded Port Projects and Lessons from Previous Projects
4.17        The project will be associated with two Bank funded port projects in Algeria and Morocco,
both are being implemented. The Algeria Third Ports Project (Ln. 3105), is designed to improve
investment planning and programming, operational efficiency and financial viability in the port sub-sector.
The project involves the rehabilitation and upgrading of long-established ports and will not have an
adverse impact on the environment. The Morocco Port Sector Project (Ln. 3283/4) consists of a
component of the 1991-1993 port sector investment program as well as an institutional development
component mainly to encourage policies aimed at increasing productivity and better planning.
4.18        We do not have experience in the Region with projects dealing with oil pollution in
international waters, however, several Bank financed port projects have been completed in the three
Maghreb countries; they include the Arzew port project in Algeria, the Casablanca and Mohammedia port
project in Morocco and the Tunis/La Goulette port project in Tunisia. The main experience from
completed and ongoing Bank-financed projects in the ports sub-sector is that the project design needs to
carefully intermingle investments with policy and institutional reforms.  Under the above projects,
problems in public sector operations helped to shift the focus towards creating and developing autonomous
enterprises, and towards harnessing the potential of the private sector through the creation of an
appropriate business environment and adoption of new technologies.
K. Rationale for GET Fundin
4.19        The rationale for GET funding of the project is based on the need to address potential
negative environmental impacts of discharged ballast and bilge waters, as well as accidental oil spills, on
the southwestern part of the Mediterranean, and the lack of resources to tackle this issue of global
importance. Given the competing demands of the various sectors on their national budgets, it is unlikely
that the Maghreb Countries would, on their own, allocate funds for combatting the problem of marine
pollution. The availability of grant funds will reinforce the Governments' commitment to participate in
reducing the risk of marine pollution. GET funding is thus justified based on the direct and indirect
capture of global benefits that such a project will enable. In addition it serves as a focal point for
gathering and sharing techniques for combatting oil pollution.
L. Sustainability
4.20        The existing institutions in the three countries, including the three project beneficiaries, have
the competencies to maintain ancd operate the facilities and equipment provided under the project. In
addition, the project will provide training to implement ancl operate the national and regional contingency
plans.  Technical assistance will be geared toward developing mechanisms to achieve financial
sustainability for the facilities and regional organizations, and will include the development of means to
cover investment and operating costs based on the result of the technical and marketing studies that will



- 20 -
evaluate re-refining or alternate uses of recovered oily materials.  Meanwhile, each of the three
Governments will be committed to providing the funds needed to operate and maintain its share of the
facilities and equipment supplied under the project.
M. Cost Recoverv
4.21        A recent study carried out by the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) to
monitor ports in the Mediterranean region, and assess their ability to handle oil pollution caused by
maritime transport, revealed continuing widespread non-compliance with oil reception requirements. Out
of 82 ports surveyed in 16 Mediterranean countries, 47 had reception facilities, but all of divergent
capacities; some were inoperative and others had only partially equipped installations. The remaining
35 ports had no reception facilities at all. It is for these reasons that ship masters are sometimes
compelled to discharge their ballast and bilge waters into the open sea. Important for the success of any
arrangement for marine pollution control is strict policing of these requirements, otherwise it will be
difficult to fully recover the cost invested in the reception facilities.
4.22        The International Convention of Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage was adopted by
the International Legal Conference on Marine Damage convened in Brussels in June 1969. A 1976
Protocol to it as well as 1984 and 1992 Protocols to amend the convention were agreed at diplomatic
conferences hosted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The Convention applies only to
persistent oils. A shipowner is strictly liable, subject to certain limited exceptions, for pollution damage
caused by oil which has escaped from a tanker carrying oil in bulk. In return for strict liability, and in
the absence of fault or privity on his part, the owner may limit his liability to a sum set by reference to
the size of the vessel concerned. Ships carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk must be insured
against their maximum liability and a claimant is able to sue the insurer directly rather than the owner.
Jurisdiction is restricted to the courts of the contracting party suffering the damage, and judgement is
enforceable in other contracting states. The convention applies only to pollution damage caused in the
territory, including the territorial waters, of a contracting state, and to reasonable measures taken to
prevent and minimize such damage after pollution has occurred. The convention does not apply to
unidentifiable sources of pollution or to meastures taken to prevent pollution.  The texts of other
international conventions dealing with maritime oil pollution, including compensation for damage caused
by an oil spill, are given in Annex 1.
4.23        Since the proposed facilities financed by the GET grants and their operation and maintenance
are separate from the usual port activities, they would be treated as separate cost and revenue centers.
Therefore, in order to maintain the financial viability of handling ballast and bilge waters or oil spills,
new tariffs based on cost recovery need to be developed for each port under a uniform tariff structure.
A study to recommend measures to be taken by each of the three governments to recover investment costs
through tariffs on ships and/or marketing the end products, is being carried out by the consultants
employed by the CRCP to prepare the project. As detailed in para 4.02(vi) during negotiations
assurances were obtained from the three recipients that they will implement consultant's recommendations
in this regard by December 1995.

V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BeneFits
5.01        The project is designed to meet the GEF objective of protecting international waters. The
development of a sub-regional working group will enhance marine pollution management through
development of a common approach and mechanisms, as well as providing a linkage to the Malta Center
of REMPEC. Components of the project are aimed at strengthening and enhancing port and national
regulations, regulatory mechanisms and the linkage between environmental monitoring and management.
Port reception facilities will meet current national or international standards of operation and quality of
effluent. Recovered oily materials will be re-refined or used as bulk fuels, in concert with local and
national waste management programs. Where appropriate, the subsequent handling and treatment of
recovered oily materials will serve as a model for the recovery of other oily wastes (e.g., vehicle oils)
as well as other land-based environmental management programs.
5.02        The project would contribute to efficient cooperation within each country and within the
region to control oil pollution and detect any ship or tanker not abiding by the local laws and international
conventions related to the prevention of marine oil pollution. It would improve the countries' capabilities
to deal with accidental oil spills and provide equipment and facilities to collect and treat oily ballast and
bilge waters thus reducing hydrocarbon contamination in the Mediterranean. The project would lay the
foundation for permanent cooperation in the region in terms of monitoring and compliance auditing, state
of marine pollution reporting, and a common approach for spill response. As the project will have an
overall positive impact on the Mediterranean sea, it has been classified as category "B". The environment
assessment of the project is presented in Annex 8. The above benefits are difficult to evaluate in
monetary and economic terms especially as regards repercussions of accidental oil spills.
B. Risk
5.03     Risk: The project would not pose any specific technical risks, however, the main risk to
project implementation are related to the Governments' willingness to maintain their cooperation, enforce
the preparation and adoption of the NCPs and the cooperative agreement, enforce regulations which deal
with marine pollution problems, and implement adequate cost recovery. This risk would be mitigated
by: (a) current commitment of the three Governments to follow up on the preparation study and
implement studies recommendations related to the above aspects, and the project components as defined
in (paras. 4.02 and 4.03); (b) the national and regional benefits resulting from project implementation and
future sector lending operations, especially the follow up on environmental investments needed for coastal
and ports protection; and (c) existence of advance drafts of National Contingency Plans, and agreement
reached by the three port authorities to sign a joint cooperative agreement for combatting accidental oil
spills. Also, comprehensive project preparation has been carried out with the cooperation of local
authorities, CRCP members, and the consultants financed through the PPAs (paras. 4.07 and 4.08). The
Bank follow up effort would be intensive to ensure maximum success of project implementation during
the various stages of the project.

International Conventions and Regulatory Provisions
for Controlling Marine Pollution by Oil
1.    International conventions and other legal instruments dealing with various
aspects of marine oil pollution prevention, control and compensation, can be
divided into (a) global agreements, applicable also to the Mediterranean; and (b)
regional agreements, binding to the Mediterranean states.
A. GLOBAL AGREEMENTS
2.    International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil
(OILPOL): This convention entered into force in 1958 and marked the first major
step towards international control of marine pollution. Amendments were made in
1962 and 1969 and entered into force in 1967 and 1978, respectively.   The
convention applies only to persistent petroleum oils, i.e., crude, fuel, heavy,
diesel and lubricating oils. According to the provisions under this convention,
tankers over 150 gross registered tons (GRT) may discharge oil only if the vessel
is more than 50 miles from the nearest land, is under way, and the total quantity
discharged is restricted to 1/15,000 of total cargo carrying capacity. Other
seagoing ships over 500 GRT are subject to similar restrictions, except that the
discharge must be made as far as practicable from land and the oil content of the
discharge must not exceed 100 ppm (parts per million) Other requirements are:
*     Vessels must maintain an oil record book and log certain
operations; and
*     Contracting parties must provide at their main ports adequate
reception facilities for the residues from oil ballast water
and tank washings from non-tanker vessels. These provisions
have been largely superseded by the more stringent regulations
of MARPOL 73/78 (see below).
3.    International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973,
as amended in 1978 (MARPOL 73/78): This convention entered into force in October
1983, and is the first to regulate all forms of marine pollution from ships,
except dumping. Annex I of the Convention, dealing with oil, differs from the
1954 OILPOL Convention in a number of important aspects:
*     Restrictions on discharge apply to all petroleum oil except
petrochemicals;
While the 1954 discharge criteria are retained for existing
tankers, for new tankers the total quantity permissible is
reduced by half;
No discharges are permissible from either tanker or non-tanker
vessels in "special areas" designated under the convention,



Annex 1
Page 2 of 13
i.e., the Baltic, Mediterranean, Black and Red Seas and the
Gulf Area (from 1989, also the Gulf of Aden, following
decisions at the 25th session of the Marine Environment
Protection Committee of IMO in November 1987);
*     Otherwise discharges from non-tanker vessels may be made only
at a distance of more than 12 miles from the nearest land;
*     All tankers of over 150 GRT are required to have monitors that
will provide details of the rate and amount of discharge, and
in new tankers have to have an automatic shut-off device;
*     A more detailed Oil Record Book covering a wider range of
operations is specified and must be maintained;
*     All new tankers of 70,000 deadweight tons (DWT) or above must
be provided with segregated ballast tanks of sufficient
capacity to allow a ship to operate safely on ballast voyages
without using oil tanks for water ballast;
*     The need to provide adequate reception facilities is extended
to oil loading terminals, repair ports and other ports in
which ships have oily residues to discharge; and
*     Port states may inspect ships to verify whether a ship has
discharged  any  harmful  substance  in  violation  of  the
Regulations and detain sub-standard vessels until faults are
corrected.    The  flag  state's  competence  extends  to all
offenses except for those omitted under the coastal state's
jurisdiction.
4.    International Convention relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases
of Oil Pollution Casualties (1969): This convention, which entered into force in
1975, gives a coastal state the right to intervene on the high seas only after
a casualty has occurred and there is grave and imminent danger of pollution of
its coastline or territorial waters, or related interests. A coastal state may
take such action, as is necessary, to avoid a pollution danger after having first
consulted the flag state of the vessel concerned. This convention is important,
inter alia, because it legitimizes contingency plans which coastal states develop
to deal with marine pollution disasters.   In fact, this convention owes its
existence to the Torrey Canyon incident when the British authorities realized
that they lacked legal authority to intervene on a foreign vessel outside their
jurisdiction, despite grave danger of pollution.
5.    International Convention of Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of
1969 (CLC), and the 1984 Protocol: The convention entered into force in June 1975
and was adopted by the International Legal conference on Marine Damage convened
in Brussels; the 1984 Protocol was agreed at the diplomatic conference held at
IMO in 1984. The convention applies only to persistent oils. A shipowner is
strictly liable, subject to certain limited exceptions, for pollution damage



Annex 1
Page 3 of 13
caused by oil which has escaped from a tanker carrying oil in bulk. In return
for strict liability, and in the absence of fault or privity on his part, the
owner may limit his liability to a sum set by reference to the size of the vessel
concerned. Ships carrying more than 2,000 tons of oil in bulk must be insured
against their maximum liability and a claimant is able to sue the insurer
directly rather than the owner.
6.    Jurisdiction is restricted to the courts of the contracting party suffering
the damage, and judgments are enforceable in other contracting states.   The
convention applies only to pollution damage caused in their territory, including
the territorial sea, of a contracting state, and to reasonable measures taken to
prevent and minimize such damage after pollution has occurred. The convention
does not apply to unidentifiable sources of pollution or to measures taken to
remove the threat of pollution. Changes introduced by the 1984 Protocol include:
*     An  amended  definition  of  "ship"  to  include  combination
carriers and unladen vessels not clean of oil residues;
*     The definition of a "pollution incident"  is broadened to
include the "threat of pollution";
*     The concept of "pollution damage" includes compensation for
impairment of the environment as long as this is limited to
the costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually
undertaken or to be undertaken; and
*     The area covered by the convention is extended to the 200 mile
exclusive economic zone of a state or a comparable area.
7.    International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for
Oil Pollution Damage of 1971 (Fund Convention, or FC) and the 1984 Protocol: The
convention, which entered into force in 1978 with the establishment of the
International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Fund, provides compensation for
pollution damage additional to the sums available under CLC (para. 13) so that,
where CLC liability ends, Fund provision begins. Compensation payable to victims
was raised by the Assembly of the IOPC Fund during the 9th session, in October
1986, to a maximum of US$60 million per incident. Liability may also arise under
the Fund in certain cases where CLC does not apply, e.g., pollution damage
resulting from natural phenomena or an exceptional kind.
8.    The scope of the Fund is governed by CLC provisions in that the Convention
relates only to persistent oil carried in bulk, to damage occurring in the
territory, including the territorial seas, of a contracting state, and to
preventive measures.   The convention indemnifies shipowners for part of the
clean-up costs incurred under CLC. Indemnification may be denied if it can be
proved that the polluting ship, with the owner's knowledge, did not comply with
relevant  international  conventions  on safety  and oil pollution.    Changes
introduced under the 1984 Protocol include the following:
*     Application of the revised definitions and of the geographical



Annex 1
Page 4 of 13
area of the CLC to the FC; and
*     Introduction of a "two tier" coverage scheme for raising the
present limit up to US$200 million per incident.
9.    In addition to the two international conventions dealing with liability and
compensation for oil pollution damage, there also exist two voluntary industry
agreements providing for compensation, namely, Tanker Owners' Voluntary Agreement
Concerning Liability for Oil Pollution of 1969 (TOVALOP) and the Contract
Regarding an Interim Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution of 1971
(CRISTAL), which deal with liability of shipowners and cargo owners,
respectively. It is intended that these agreements will eventually disappear
once all states become parties to CLC and FC. The 1984 diplomatic conference
also tried to establish an international regime of liability and compensation for
pollution damage caused by harmful and noxious substances other than oil (HNS).
However, consensus could not be reached, which leaves an important deficiency in
applicable international law.
10.   United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNLOSC):  This umbrella
convention, adopted at Montego Bay in 1982, deals, inter alia, with all forms of
marine pollution.   Part XII of this convention does not only provide general
rules which are supposed to be supplemented by technical conventions (e.g., IMO
rules on vessel source pollution and regional and sub-regional rules). It also
provides for a far more efficient enforcement system than any other currently in
force.  The rules are based on flag state jurisdiction which are of limited
value, especially in view of the flogs of convenience vessels. UNLOSC recognizes
flag state jurisdiction, but supplements this concept by port State jurisdiction
which enables states to prosecute vessels using their ports and terminals for
offenses committed anywhere at sea.  The importance of this new, progressive
rule, can be seen best if one analyses the level of prosecutions, currently
undertaken by governments, for pollution offenses committed at sea.
11.   Even  in  countries  such  as  the  United Kingdom  (U.K.),  only  a  few
prosecutions are undertaken every year.   Part of the problem, of course, is
technical: it is not always possible to identify a polluter. However, even if
a polluter can be identified, port states frequently lack jurisdictional powers
to prosecute. Unfortunately, the Law of the Sea Convention is not yet in force
and is not likely to become effective in the near future. The reason for this
is the opposition from the United States and some other countries (including the
U.K.) in view of the provisions relating to deep sea bed mining. However, there
exists a broad consensus -in environmental provisions which could possibly apply
as customary law as was done with provisions of the convention relating to 200
mile .:Exclusive fishing zone.
B. REGIONAL AGREEMENTS
12.   In  addition  to  globally  applicable  international  agreements,  the
international law also encourages regional cooperation in the field of marine
pollution prevention and control on the assumption that the necessary political



Annex 1
Page 5 of 13
will is easier to generate in a regional setting where states share similar if
not identical interests and where geographic and other factors may render
environment more vulnerable to pollution than that of the world's seas at large.
The MARPOL Convention designated the Mediterranean as "special area". Moreover,
the Mediterranean was the first sea in which the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) became involved through its Regional Seas Program. The other type
of regional control of marine pollution applicable, inter alia, in the
Mediterranean, are legal instruments of the European Communities (EEC). EEC's
competence in the environmental affairs was sometimes questioned in the past
because it was not expressly referred to in the Treaty of Rome. However, this
is  no  longer  the  case,   following  recent  revision  of  the  treaty.
13.   Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean against Pollution
(Barcelona Convention): The convention was signed by all Mediterranean coastal
states (except*Albania) in 1976, was joined by EEC in 1977, and entered into
force in February 1978. The area covered is the Mediterranean from the Straits
of Gibraltar to the Dardanelles, except for the internal waters of the states
concerned. The status of "special area", given to the Mediterranean Sea under
MARPOL, implied that no oil discharges are allowed anywhere. The convention is
a comprehensive umbrella document, which UNEP subsequently broadly copied in
other regional seas.   Unlike the Helsinki Convention of 1974 for the Baltic
(another "special area" under MARPOL, where coastal states acted outside UNEP
umbrella), there is no mechanism to administer and implement the convention.
However, several specific protocols were adopted to supplement the Barcelona
Convention. They are described below.
14.   Protocol concerning Cooperating in Combating Pollution of the Mediterranean
Sea by Oil and Other Harmful Substances in Cases of Emergency: This Protocol was
agreed in 1976 and came into force in 1978. The contracting parties agreed to
cooperate in dealing with emergencies in the region in order to reduce or
eliminate any damage caused by an incident. They must also notify UNEP and any
other state likely to be affected. Under the Protocol UNEP has established in
cooperation with IMO, a Regional Oil Combatting Center (ROCC) in Malta to receive
reports and to coordinate action.
15.   "Dumping" Protocol to Barcelona Convention: Following the main provisions
of the global 1972 London Pumping Convention (para. 9) and the 1972 Oslo
Convention (applicable to Northwestern Europe), this Protocol prohibits dumping
of "black list" substances and provides that the "grey list" substances may be
disposed of at sea only under special license from relevant authorities. All
other dumping must have a general permit.
16.   Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean  Sea
against Pollution of 1976, and concerning Mediterranean Specially Protected Areas
of 1982: For the purpose of this protocol, specially protected areas are limited
to the territorial waters of contracting parties. These areas can be established
to safeguard: (a) sites of biological and ecological value; (b) breeding grounds
and population levels of marine species and habitats; and (c) sites of particular
importance because of their scientific, aesthetic, historical archaeological,
cultural on educational character.

METHODS OF COMBATTING OIL SPILLS AT SEA
GENERAL
Most major oil spills occur at sea; and the most effective responses put into
operation two principal techniques:
(a)   mechanical recovery; and
(b)   dispersion by chemical products.
A.   Mechanical Recovery
The objective of the project is to provide each of the three countries with the
means for mechanically recovering 1000 m3 of pollutant. A spill greater than this would put into
operation:
sub-regional agreement for cooperation involving all three countries; and
regional agreements within the guidelines of the Barcelona Convention and its
protocol.
The objective is to bring standards closer to those currently met, in France and
Malta.
In France, for the Mediterranean region, the capacity for mechanical intervention
(one or two petroleum coaster(s) equipped with skimmer) allows the recovery of the following
volumes of hydrocarbon:
for one oil coaster: 100 m3 to 1000 m3; and
for two oil coaster: 1000 m3 to 5000 m3.
For a volume of hydrocarbon to be recovered in excess of 5000 m3
private assistance will be called upon according to the outline of the cooperation agreement.
For a petroleum oil coaster which is being employed, recovery is achieved by:
-     aerial guidance; and/or
-     confining operations: each target unit consisting for example of:
-     2 tug-boats (power = 200 CV); and
-     8 booms each of 110 m (for a U opening of 80m);



Annex 2
Page 2 of 8
-     chartering of fishing boats, particularly trawlers is preferable;
-     extra tug capacity for the transfer of adaptable tanks;
For Malta, the capacity for intervention allows the recovery of 1000 m3 of oil
(including coastal mechanical recovery and dispersant spreading).
The ability for mechanical recovery will correspond to the ability of treatment by
dispersant, as well as the level of assistance achieved through cooperation among the three
countries, as per the sub-regional agreement. This capacity for mechanical recovery is suitable
with respect to previous accidents. Admittedly the accident involving KHARK V caused the
spillage of 70 000 tons, but, a petroleum oil spill in the sea undergoes a process which reduces
the volume by several means:
(a)   evaporation, possibly as much as 25%;
(b)   dispersion;
(c)   sedimentation;
(d)   dissolving; and
(e)   oil/water emulsion.
Regarding the number of the recovering devices, at least three oil coasters with
high sea boom-skimmers capable of handling an oil spill of 1000 m3 will be needed for each
country. The entire resources of the three countries allows them to be jointly prepared for an
oil spill of about 3000 m3. Additional resources for recovery in order to deal with a capacity
of 5000 m3 will be achieved by the supply of equipment from France, Italy, (Barcelona
Agreement) or from the European Community.
B.    Dispersion by Chemical Products
Spraying dispersant can be carried out by air (plane, helicopter) or by sea. As
regards aerial spraying, helicopters used for pesticide spraying have a distinct advantage over
other types of aircraft as they are already equipped for this function. As for spraying by boat,
it will be limited to tug-boats of 6000 hp, and harbor tug-boats. Preferably, spraying will be
accomplished by launching ramps with third generation dispersant pre-mixed with water and
sprayed using a fire hose and control nozzle.  The criteria for choice of dispersant and
equipment for spraying are discussed below.
Choice of Dispersant
The following must be taken into consideration:
(a)   The nature of hydrocarbon;
(b)   The method of storage; and



Annex 2
Page 3 of 8
(c)    The shelf life of the stock.
Choice of Dispersant
The stock has to be tested in order to evaluate its efficiency in dispersing an oil
spill and should be stored near to sprayer units. It is beneficial to have an available stock
allowing:
(a)   in each zone from where helicopters can be dispatched, enough for one day's
aerial application (it would be recommended that a stock of aviation fuel is kept
with the dispersant stock); and
(b)   an application (by boat) for a period of one day.
In case the treatment is expected to last for more than one day, it is advisable to
have a central stock available, allowing treatment of additional one day. This stock should be
transported to the port or aircraft base on the first day of the intervention. After this time,
contact has to be made with the supplier to provide additional supply from the production
factory. Although dispersant keeps relatively well, it is necessary to shake the contents before
use in order to make the product homogeneous. How the dispersant reacts under severe weather
conditions (heat, cold) is not well-known. It is, therefore, necessary to make sure that stocks
are checked and tested in each of the three countries at least every three years, preferably once
every year.
It should be noted that:
(a)    aircraft (planes, helicopters) have the advantage of rapid deployment, but not
always the most efficient standard of treatment as wind-blown dispersant results
in losses of 20 to 50%; and
(b)    boats are slow to react, but their use on site can be more versatile particularly for
pollution which has been broken up, as well as their ability to control the level
of treatment with respect to the quantities of oil encountered.
The equipment for helicopters is of the "bucket" type and *for boats is the self-
governing type consisting of a pump and a launching ramp. In order to avoid the inconvenience
of a stem wave which may push the oil far from the boat and possibly beyond the treatment
ramps, the equipment should be placed on the bough of the boat and the dispersant is applied
before the occurrence of a stem wave.

MOROCCO
Means of recovery
The principal recovery equipment are four oil-coasters used by the company
PETROCAB; these can be fitted so as to allow the use of high-sea skimmer on each side. This,
however, remains the responsibility of ODEP who will determine the nature of the contract with
this company and the availability of the equipment. In the case of a major contamination, the
urgency of the situation must permit the use of a requisition procedure. The four coasters
constitute a number sufficient to combat oil spills in the sea (provided that the adaptations are
permanent and their capabilities checked), and would allow Morocco to deal with a
contamination of about 5000 m3.
The additional sea back-up would be the trawlers (numbering 8).
The assessment of needs is as follows:
Recovery equipment:                                       Number

BASIC PRINCIPLES OF A REGIONAL POLICY OF COOPERATION
IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACCIDENTAL OIL SPILLS
Following the recent accidental oil spills of the AEGEAN SEA at
COROGNE at the end of 1992, the BRAER in the SHETLANDS and MAERSK NAVIGATOR in
SUMATRA in January 1993, a number of international authorities, states and
professional bodies have manifested a wish to reinforce the safety standards
of ships carrying dangerous substances. The majority of the recommendations
made at that time can easily be applied to the three North African countries
of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia.
A North African regional policy for managing accidental pollution
should cover preventative measures on the one hand, and emergency responses on
the other. Such a policy could be put into operation in several stages.
1.    REGIONAL PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
The common concern of the three countries should be to protect the
Mediterranean Sea from both real and potential impacts of maritime traffic.
This could be achieved through the following legal, technical And
administrative measures:
A.    LEGAL MEASURES
The IMO is at present studying the possibility of drafting and
bringing into force relevant agreements on maritime safety and the prevention
of pollution. It is expected that Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia will ratify
such agreements once they have been drafted.
Each of these countries is also expected to make provisions in
their national regulations for requiring ships transporting hydrocarbons or
harmful substances to inform the relevant authorities of their entry into
their territorial waters,
In addition to these measures, which can be taken by each country
individually, there are others which they can take collectively to create a
common legal ground for prosecuting offenses relative to the protection of the
environment.
Amongst the measures that the three countries are expected to take
collectively is the monitoring of ships by the state at each port. One way
to protect the marine environment is to eliminate the use of ships not meeting
reasonable safety standards. Most importantly, such monitoring will only be
effective if a port receiving a ship under another country's flag can take
legal action against that country if, upon inspection, the port discovers a
case of negligence, and therefore, protect itself from the risks that unsafe
ships provoke. Such is the objective of the Paris Memorandum drafted in 1978
between neighboring countries of the English Channel and the North Sea, of



Annex 3
Page 2 of 9
which the positive effects are indisputable. An identical system could be
applied in North Africa in which the countries would undertake to:
-     put into operation in the ports of each country an efficient and
coordinated system of monitoring foreign merchant ships without
discrimination of flag;
-     inspect a significant percentage of the ships entering the ports
of the three countries;
-     cooperate and exchange information collected on the ships which
have visited. Access to information must be free and
comprehensive;
-     collectively train inspectors responsible for the monitoring;
-     cooperate with other regions having the same inspections and
exchange information with them; and
-     ensure for each of the countries, the comprehensiveness and
enforceability of the sanctions when an offense has been committed
in another country party to the agreement.
B.    TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS
The IMO has for a long time been drawing the attention of its
members to the importance of certain technical and administrative arrangements
for the prevention of pollution. Amongst the actions which the countries
could take is the monitoring of maritime traffic and a common policy
concerning the waste produced by ships.
C.    REGULATION AND MONITORING OF MARITIME TRAFFIC
In as much as is possible, precautions are to be taken so that, in
the waters of the three countries, maritime traffic avoids particularly
vulnerable areas meeting at least one of the ecological, economic, cultural,
scientific or educational criteria laid down by the IMO.
Monitoring of traffic can be performed either from land, or by
aerial means, or possibly from ships. In all these cases, it must not be
forgotten that these different means aim to help navigation by taking charge
of the different ships. This control will be much more efficient by combining
the following two conditions:
-     transmission of data from a control center (or from a VTS) to
another so that a ship crossing the Mediterranean can remain
monitored for the duration of its journey along the length of the
coastline;
identification of the suitability of personnel manning the control



Annex 3
Page 3 of 9
centers. Not only is it necessary that personnel are qualified
but also, that the required qualifications are the same in all
three countries.
(a)   Common policy concerning the waste produced by ships:
In general, petroleum wastes from maritime traffic are of two
types:
used ballast water from petroleum oil tankers; and
-     various oily residues and sediments produced by non oil-
carrying ships.
These two categories of waste require two different treatments
upon which the signatories to the regional agreement for
cooperation would have to decide.
(b)   Regional policy concerning reception facilities for used ballast
water:
The national experts who met in Cairo in December 1991 to
study the problem of port reception facilities in the
Mediterranean suggested a number of proposals concerning
regional cooperation, including inspection by the national
authority of the port and monitoring of the navigation
routes.
It is expected that the three countries adopt a common
tariff policy and a common warning system for the reception
of ships to avoid making one of the countries appear more
attractive or more stringent with respect to the other two
countries. In addition, it would be advisable that the
three countries form a group of experts responsible for
following the technological growth in the field of reception
facilities; the same group, could ensure liaisons with other
Mediterranean countries dealing with the same problems.
(c)   A common policy concerning oily waste produced by non oil-carrying
ships:
A collective view on this problem would allow the development of
an acceptable regional policy built essentially on:
-     locating the centers for collection of waste residues.  This
must be realistic in relation to the technical and
logistical capability of the three countries;
-     cost recovery. The low market value of this type of waste



Annex 3
Page 4 of 9
will make it necessary to cover the costs of treatment
through appropriate tariffs and national budgets; but, in as
much as is possible, the tariffs for unloading this type of
waste will have to be calculated in such a way that it does
not penalize the ships.
2. RESPONSE MEASURES
-     preparatory measures for combatting pollution consisting of
the entire group of provisions adopted by the national
authorities responsible for improving the response
capability to threats of pollution or to a reported incident
of pollution; and
-     the actual pollution prevention and clean up operations
which consist of putting into place the institutional
facilities, plans and equipment provided for these purposes.
These two types of measures fit in with both international and
regional cooperation. The Barcelona and Lisbon agreements signed by the three
countries are based on this form of cooperation.
A.     REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR COMBATTING POLLUTION
Five measures are proposed within the context of regional
cooperation:
development of a regional emergency plan;
-     defining a common policy for use of products to combat
pollution;
-     making the means for combatting pollution available;
-     organizing regional exercises for combatting pollution; and
-     the training of personnel.
(a)   Regional emergency plan:
The Terms of Reference (TORs) of the consultants' study require
the consultants to develop a national emergency plan for each
country and to integrate these three plans into a regional plan
which will assess the possibilities for cooperation presented by
the international agreements signed by the three countries
(Barcelona agreement and Lisbon agreement).



Annex 3
Page 5 of 9
(b)   Defining a common policy for the use of treatment products:
A project to develop a code of practice for the use of dispersant
in combatting hydrocarbon pollution at sea has been prepared and
submitted to the countries bordering the Mediterranean. It
incorporates a number of guidelines aimed at harmonizing the
policies of the countries using or intending to use dispersant as
a means of pollution clean up. The Republic of Tunisia has made
some comments on this project related to the following issues:
-     control of out-of-date dispersant stock;
-     studies on the impact of dispersant in zones where they have
been used;
-     transfer of technology; and
-     development of rules for using dispersant and the respect of
these rules in the case of assistance by another country.
These observations appear to be well founded. The three countries
should have a common policy for the use of dispersant; and an
active cooperation is to be established between them for approving
treatment products.
(c)   Making equipment for combatting pollution available
A policy of regional cooperation dealing with preparing for
pollution clean up naturally relies on the ability to place the
available means of each country at the disposal of the countries
facing a pollution incident. This facility of mutual assistance
between the three countries will apply to personnel and equipment.
This must be taken into account in the national emergency plans in
order to optimize both the location of national stocks and their
composition:
-     location of stocks: the locations for equipment will be
determined in such a way that the coastline of the three
countries is fully covered and that the distribution is
even; and
the composition of stocks: the cooperation agreement is to
allow the three countries to estimate the complementarity of
equipment. For example, two neighboring stocks are to
contain, in as much as is possible, complementary equipment
so that the mobilization of these two groups of equipment
allows the majority of situations to be dealt with.



Annex 3
Page 6 of 9
(d)   Organization of regional exercises for combatting pollution:
Regional exercises should be carried out every 3 or 4 years in
order to test the reliability of the regional emergency plan,
notably the alert stage, in order to familiarize the personnel
with working together and to check the availability and operation
of equipment.
The regional emergency plan will include a framework for such
exercises which mobilize vast amounts of equipment and large
numbers of personnel.
(e)   Training of personnel:
The most perfect equipment risks being rendered inefficient if it
is operated by inexperienced personnel. This is already true at
the national level; but is even more true at the regional level
where the cooperation between states regarding response to an
incident will be even more effective if it is based on a common
training of personnel involved in operations of pollution
prevention and clean up. The need for common training has been
expressed several times by the Bank and the CRCP. This training
will be on several levels:
training in crisis management which will bring together
those in charge of managing the pollution prevention and
clean up operations at sea, on the coastline or in port
areas;
-     training experience for heads of pollution clean up sites,
aimed at personnel called upon to lead operational sites of
about one hundred people.
B.    REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR POLLUTION COMBAT OPERATIONS
The area of pollution clean up is without doubt the one where the
cooperation is most important. It relies on two principles:
-     shared information; and
-     mutual assistance
Besides a commonality of information skills, it will be advisable
to eventually create a training center in one of the three countries, where
personnel of different skill levels will be trained. This center could
subsequently train both arabic speaking and french speaking people.



Annex 3
Page 7 of 9
(a)   Shared information:
This can take several forms; those types of information most
likely to be encountered:
information about accidents occurring off one of the
countries of the agreement;
information about pollution in progress: the nature and
volume of discharged product, the area covered by the drift
of the slick. Such information can allow neighboring
countries to have at hand the necessary means and plans of
action in order to deal with the pollution if it reaches its
coastline;
information on the results obtained during the pollution
clean up operations, successes, shortcomings that have been
noticed and on the improvements to be made to the plan of
action.
(b)   Mutual assistance:
In the case of an accident creating a threat of pollution or
causing an actual pollution incident, the three countries will go
to the assistance of the threatened country by putting at its
disposal:
-     personnel (hence the importance of a common training
program); and
-     equipment (hence the importance of the location of the stock
and of the complementarity of equipment).
3.    PUTTING INTO OPERATION THE POLICY FOR COOPERATION
All the activities listed above do not have the same degree of
importance; in addition some of them could only be put into operation after
the project has been completed; and some would be brought in only after the
cooperation has been in practice for several years. Improving and harmonizing
the different operational protocols for the different agencies involved in
pollution prevention and response will make it possible to achieve comparable
results in the different countries.
The following outlines the different stages proposed for bringing
into effect regional cooperation:



Annex 3
Page 8 of 9
A. MEASURES WHICH CAN BE BROUGHT INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY
(a)    Prevention:
Legal measures
-     Development of more restrictive national regulations; and
-     Adoption of plans for inspection by the state authority of
the port.
Technical and administrative measures
-     Regulation of traffic in the proximity of zones particularly
at risk from petroleum waste pollution;
-     Regional policy for reception facilities; and
-     Regional policy for the treatment of waste residue produced
by non oil-carrying ships;
(b)   Preparation for pollution clean up:
-     Adoption of a common policy for the use of treatment
products.
B.     MEASURES LINKED TO THE REALIZATION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
Monitoring of maritime traffic (after 3 VTS have been provided in
Algeria).
(a)   Preparation for pollution clean up:
-     Development of a regional emergency plan;
-     Development of a project for regional agreement;
-     Training of personnel;
-     Sharing of information and mutual assistance in the case of
a pollution incident.
C.    SUBSEQUENT OPERATIONAL MEASURES TO BE TAKEN
This concerns essentially the measures aimed at harmonizing the
operational procedures for response to a pollution incident. These measures
rely on the three countries accepting common protocols indicating the rules to
follow in order to take a specific action. The application of such protocols
allows for the comparison of results of the operations since they will have
been performed in an identical way in the three countries; the first measures
deal with:
the "standardization" of operations involving the  remote
detection of hydrocarbons and chemical products discharged
at sea;



Annex 3
Page 9 of 9
-     the "standardization" of tests of efficiency of the
treatment products used for combatting hydrocarbon pollution
(dispersant, cleaning products for rocks...)
For a later phase: the availability of instruments necessary for
application of the agreement on inspection of ships by the individual national
port authorities (secretariat and computerized center).
4.     FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE REGIONAL POLICY
The measures examined above will not have any financial
implications. Indeed, the recommendations which have been made essentially
deal with improving the measures of prevention which concentrate on:
-     the reinforcement of certain legal instruments; and
-     the development and application of the different regional
policies and agreements.
As for the measures for response to pollution, they have financial
implications either evaluated (regional emergency, training of personnel), or
they are without financial implication (sharing of information mutual
assistance..).
The first regional exercise for pollution clean up is scheduled
for 1997; it will be financed locally by the three governments.
It should be emphasized that the development and the putting into
operation of a regional policy will be a lengthy process requiring the people
in charge in the three countries to work closely together. The financing of
the different activities comprising the regional policy will be the
responsibility of each of the states. This is one of the necessary conditions
for the success of such a policy.

TRAINING POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS
INITIAL OBSERVATIONS
The assessment of training needs has to be made without certain necessary facts
being available:
-    the role of the Ministries and organizations responsible for combatting marine
pollution will only be known after the adoption of national emergency plans and
the regional emergency plan;
-    the training program will have to be adapted to the equipment actually in the
possession of each administration; and
-    wherever possible, training will be given on a regional basis so as to familiarize
the personnel with working together.
A.    TRAUNING  OF PERSONNEL RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING
MARITlME TRAFFIC
Procedure and Training:
The type and quality of equipment and facilities available to the ports are not
enough to produce efficient VTS (Vessel Traffic Services). It is necessary to pay
as much attention to perfecting working procedures and operations as to the
technical, and training of operations personnel.
(a)  Operating Procedures
The operating procedures should aim to achieve the objectives of the VTS,
within the framework of a given administrative and technical organization and in respect of
international and local regulations.
Thus, it is necessary to establish precise documentation stating the context of
the local administrative organization, the objectives designated for the VTS center, functions
to be performed in order to achieve these objectives, the method for carrying out these
functions, notably procedures concerning exchanges between the VTS and the exterior
(principally the boats) while respecting the international and local regulations, and finally the
internal procedures of operation.



Annex 4
Page 2 of 10
Organization of Maintenance: In order to ensure the continuous availability
of pollution combatting equipment, it is necessary to put into practice a technical working
policy which takes into consideration, as much as possible, the predicted rate of equipment
failure in order to define the number and quality of technical personnel necessary to maintain
the systems and to provide these personnel with the correct maintenance procedures.
Maintenance can be classified in three categories which govern three types of spare parts:
Categorv 1: preventative maintenance and on-site availability of spare parts;
Category 2: on site repair which requires the availability of "standard
exchange" spare parts and sub-units.
Categorv 3: off-site recovery maintenance which requires the availability of a
technical service (or the manufacturer) specialized for "repair" and new parts.
(b) Training
On the basis of information about organization, working and maintenance
procedures it will be necessary to plan training of personnel according to the following
principals:
-    Training and management personnel:
These people must have ten to fifteen years experience in administrative or
operational management and a very good knowledge of the maritime field. They will receive
one month training, two weeks of which will be specific training in a college for maritime
business administration and a two week training course in an existing VTS.
Operational Work:
-    Watch ofricer: These people must have the equivalent of five or ten years
operational experience in the maritime field.
They will receive in total one month training of which two weeks will be
specific training in a college for maritime business administration and a two week training
course in an existing VTS.
-    Operators: Will be trained in operating radio and radar specific to their job
assignment, but may be required to occupy different operational posts as the need arises.
Also they will follow a complementary training for the particular procedures at VTS's as
well as an operational training course in a VTS.



Annex 4
Page 3 of 10
-    Technical Work: The people in charge of technical work as well as the
technical personnel must have significant previous training in the operational techniques in
the VTS.
(c)  Training of Personnel for Deballasting Stations
The companies specialized in the construction of deballasting stations will be
called upon to assure the training of personnel assigned to operate the installations. The
simplest solution consists of dispatching two engineers for a period of two months in each
deballasting station. In this case the training is done "on site".
(d)  Training of Laboratory Personnel
The training of this personnel will be done by the equipment manufacturer.
(e)  Training for Prevention and Combatting of Accidental Pollution
In order to define the training requirements, the following should be taken
into account:
* different potential sources of pollution;
* tasks to be accomplished;
D personnel to be trained; and
- levels of training to be achieved
(i)    Different Potential Sources of Pollution
-    Drilling or production platform accident;
-    Loading or unloading accident on the Single Buoy Mooring (SPM) or at
the port terminals;
-    Accident during navigating at sea either near the coast, or in estuary,
or in port zone; and
-    Pipe-line rupture



Annex 4
Page 4 of 10
(ii)    Tasks to Be Achieved
Following are the different types of action that are envisaged:
Clean up at sea;
Around the platforms;
Around the disabled vessel;
Between the site of the accident and coast;
Clean up in the coastline estuary or port zone
Actions taken from the land; and
Actions taken from the water.
These actions cover several types of activity; from aerial observation of the
pollution to its final removal and include projections, confinement, recovery, treatment, cleaning
and storage, in addition to management and coordination of each action.
(iii)    Identification of Personnel to be Trained
Three main groups of people are likely to participate in clean up operations
in port or coastal zones:
-    Level 1: Port commanders, management personnel of the port authorities and
supervising officers managing the "Civil Protection" organization which is
responsible for the coordination of the intervention.
-    Level II: Supervisory personnel of the port organizations, notably the port
officers, as well as officers from the "Civil Protection" organization responsible
for the organization and management of coastal clean up sites.
-    Level III: Supervisors and ground staff of the ports, and assistant protection
officers likely to be managing the clean-up sites or putting the equipment into
operation.
Following consultation with the port authorities on one side and the "Civil
Protection" organization on the other, it is expected that the total number of personnel to be
trained for combatting oil pollution is as follows:
-    148 persons for Algeria
-    185 persons for Morocco
-    137 persons for Tunisia
The following tables give the distribution of personnel to be trained under each of the
above levels.

B. PROPOSALS FOR A TRAINING PLAN
(a)  General Principles
The training plan must achieve the following objectives:
-    Provide the necessary knowledge, at the different levels, to those responsible for
combatting the pollution;
-    Create a highly motivated group dynamic within the anti-pollution institutions
at the regional and national levels; and
Encourage the different groups to acquire and share a "common bank" of
knowledge, language, working habits and responses;
In order to accomplish such a task, taking into account the required numbers,
a methodology for training must be based on two principles:
Training in stages, starting at the level of "decision maker" and finishing with
the level of "operating personnel" in order to obtain thorough familiarization and
understanding necessary to maintain the overall efficiency of the plans and
successful transmission of information; and
Pyramid training (training of the training staff) allowing the passing on of
acquired knowledge. Diversification of training is required because of the
number of people, the different disciplines to teach, and the necessity of re-
training, in particular the personnel of Level 2 who will form the pool of
training staff for Level 3.
Taking into account all of these parameters, following is the proposed training
plan concerning Level I and Level 2.

II. PREAMBULE
2.1          L'Algerie, le Maroc et la Tunisie ont exprime la volonte de lutter
contre la pollution d'hydrocarbures qui ddgrade l'environnement tant au niveau
des ports nationaux et de llensemble de leur c6te, qu'au niveau de la
Miediterranee du Sud-Ouest. Chacun d'eux a exprime le besoin de lancer un projet
national/sous-regional selon une approche commune qui les aidera efficacement a
gdrer la pollution d'hydrocarbures.
2.2          La situation actuelle est caracterisee par, sauf dans quelques cas:
(i) un manque d' infrastructure necessaire pour fournir et controler la reception
et le traitement des dechets   provenant des navires;  (ii) une limite des
capacitds nationales et regionales pour evaluer et contr6ler la pollution
petroli&re;   et  (iii)  l'absence  d'un  dispositif  national  ou  regional
d'intervention pour lutter contre les deversements de pdtrole en mer.
2.3          Le projet propose et approu-vd par les trois pays (les Beneficiaires)
et le Fonds pour l'Environnement Mondial (FEM) fera l'objet d'une etude de
prdparation et de realisation. Pour le suivi de 1'dtude et l'execution du projet
permettant de resoudre les aspects ci-dessus,  les Beneficiaires ont cr6e un
Comite Regional de Coordination du Projet (CRCP) dont le cadre d'intervention,
la composition, le fonctionnement, la responsabilite et les objectifs sont
definis dans les paragraphes ci-dessous.

11r. INTRODUCTIGN
3.1         La Mdditerrande est une we; r6giona]e semi-close *;: la ddgradatior
de 1'environnement, due A une variete A'dldment3. pose ddjA un probleme grave.
Las eaux portuaires et c6tieres se sort degrad %cs par le rejet des effluents
industriels et les eaux usees urtaines, une grande partie des eau'
internationales r6gionales son pollutes par le deversement des eaux huileusea
des navires (eaux de lest et de cale), actuellement estime A 75 pour cent des
650,000 tonnes d'hydrocarbures divers6s dans la M4diterran6e. Les etudes
realisees sur la contamination d'hydrocarbures indiquent que les eaux de la C6te
nord-africaine dans la partie sud-ouest de la Mediterranee est la deuxieme region
contenant le plus grand nombre de tiches de goudron qui se trouvent avec A peu
pres 30 pour cent de pdtrole deleste ctincentrees sur les plages algeriennes et
turisiennes.  La pollution des eaux internationales, goudron et-rdsidus, a  un
effet ndfaste direct sur l'dconomie essentiellement la composante tourisme, des
pays de la sous-region et entraine la ddgradation des ecosystemes fragiles et des
pec.heries c6ti6res.
3.2         Bien qu'A ce jour la partie sud-ouest de la Mediterrande ait dtd
6pargn6e d'accidents majeurs de petruliers, le niveau de risques est elev6.
Annuellement 58.000 navires circulent le long-de la c6te des pays du Maghreb
comprenant environ 5.000 navires transportant du petrole, 2.000 transportant des
produits chimiques, et 1.300 transportant du GNL, et transportent environ 500
millions de tonnes d'hydrocarbures et 400.000 tonnes de produits chimiques.
3.3         L'Algerie, le Maroc et l.a T-iimsie sont signataires de la Convention
de Barcelone (1976) sur la lutte contra !es doversmeents de pdtrole en mer, et
des Conventions MARPOL 73,'78 sur le d6vers..iement de dechets provenant de navires.
En .utre, les trois pays reconnaissent qu'une approche commune sous-rdgEonale,
aiderait A lutter contre 'a pollution d'hydrocarbures. Chacun d'eux a exprime la
volonte de  participer A la rdalisation du projet sous-regional/national et
d'dtudier avec l'aide de la Communaute europeenne, la possibilite de mettre en
place une structure regionale pour lutter contre les deversements de pdtrole en
mer. En effet, dans la plupart des cas, les trois pays manquent d'infrastructure
ndcessaire pour assurer et contr6ler la rdception et le traitement des dechets
provenant de navires. La capacite nationale ou regionale pour evaluer et pour
contr6ler la pollution petroliere est limitee aussi bien au niveau des services
a terre, des equipements disponibles, et des ressources humaines en laboratoires.
En outre, aucun des pays ne possede un dispositif national ou regional approprie
d'intervention pour lutter contre les deversements de petrole en mer.
IV. LES OBJECTIFS DU PROJET
4.1         L'objectif principal du projet proposd pour le financement par le FEH
consiste A reduire la propagation d'hydrocarbures aux eaux internationales de la
KMditerranee par: (a) la mise en place au niveau des ports cles en Algerie, au
Karoc et en Tunisie de structures et installations pour recevoir les ddchers; (b)
le renforcement de leur capacite de contr6le; et (c) l'augmentation de leur
capacite pour limiter les ddversements de pdtrole en mer.  La caractdristique
essentielle de ce Projet sera le developpement et la mise en place d'un Comite
Regional. Ce dernier sera responsable d'engager un bureau d' etudes pour r4aliser
l'etude du projet, coordonner et  superviser la preparation et 1'ex6cution du
projet. Le CR assurera une homogdndit6 d'approche, d'dquipements et de formation
pour tirer les bdndfices optimaux des investissements proposes.   II devra

necessaire pour absorber les deversements de p6trole; (iv)renforcer la capacite
nationale et contr6ler le respect des normes de protection de l'environnement;
et (v) renforcer le cadre de gestion de l'environnement au niveau portuaire et
opdrationnel; (vi) dtudier et mettre en place un plan national d'intervention
pour la lutte contre la pollution marine.
V. DESCRIPTION DTJ PROJET
Les Elements Sous-Rezionaux
5.1         Les activites sous-regionales sont essentielles pour: (a) assurer une
apprache commune des politiques regulatrices, des methodologies et des
dquipements; (b) promouvoir, mettre en application et coordonner l'echange
d'information: (c) organiser la formation; et (d) exploiter les donndes
nationales rassembles pour evaluer les tendances regionales a long terme en
matiere de pollution marine,   des eaux nationale les c6tieres et des eaux
internationales y  attenant.    Une meilleure  efficacite  et rentabilitd des
activites sous-regionale sera obtenue selon une approche tri-laterale pour la
gestion des structures et des 8quipements pour lutter et reduire les d6versements
de petrole en mer, et entreprendre les exercices d'entrainement. La composante
cld donc sera le developpement et la mise en place d'un Comite Regional de
Coordination.
5.2         Ce Comitd  servira les trois pays  (l'Algerie,  le Maroc,  et la
Tunisie), et veillera a ce que soit assure le lien avec le Plan de Lutte contra
la Pollution dans la Mediterranee et avec d'autres programTes sous-regiornaux de
gestion de la pollution.

(iii) Il e;'- important de s'assurer qu'il n'y a pas de rdpercussion
du  ;:csmbl.me  de  pollution  sur  une  autre  partie  de  la
M6ddterrande. Des mdcanismes regionaux se concentreronit sur
le developpement et la mise en oeuvre d'un systeme de
tarif.c-ation et de penalisation pour assurer le respect de la
conforr.itd aux normes, et en meme temps assurer la continuite
des efforts tri-latdraux et nationaux.   Le contr6le et la
vdrification regionale seront centres sur le rapprochement des
resultats  d'analyse  des  eaux  traitees  avec  les  normes
internationales. Les contr6Les peuvent egalement toucher leas
eaux nationales et les eaux internationales y attenant;
Un   Programme   pour   l'Etablissement   de   Rapports   sur

redaction des rapports sur l'e6tat de l'environnement marin, au
niveau national et sous-regional.  Ces rapports serviraient
egalement a fournir un indicateur technique pour 6valuer les
benefices    "nets"    que    l'environnement    tirera   des
investissements financds par le FEM.
Les Elements Nationaux
5.4         Ddchets provenant des navires. Une grande partie do la contamination
petroliere des eaux internationales provient du dvasrsement par des navires
d'eaux de lest et de cale.  Ce probleme d'evacuation dr d4chets est direc'ement
lie a un manque total de moyens dans les ports, et A la faLblesse, voir mdle,
L'inexistence de mecanisme rdgulateur. Les &limenti centraux des composantes
nationales seront la construction ou la rehabilitation, dans les ports cl6s des
trois pays; (i) des moyens congus pour recevoir et traiter les dechets de lest
(qui consistent  pour  la plupart d'eau);  (ii)  aes  moyens  pour  recevoir;
emmagasiner tt transporter les ddchets de cale (qui g,ndralement, ont une grande
concentration d'huile); et (iii) des moyens pour recevoir, emmagasiner et
transporter les dechets petroliers et produits apparentds (des matdriaux dont le
contenu en eau est faible). Des moyens pour traitor lea eaux de lest sont ddj&
prDpoSds pour les ports qui reeoivent la plus grande proportion de navires
strangers ou de cargaisons destineesa A ldtranger: Arzew, Bejaia, Skikda et Alger
(Algdrie); Casablanca, et Mohammedia (Maroc); at Bizerte et Skhira (Tunisie).
Bien qua Mohamedia soit situde sur la c6te atlantique du Maroc, ces ports sont
A l'origine ou la destination d'un grand nombre de navires provenant de la
Mediterranee et fournit le meilleur modele opdratiounel pour le Karoc.  Dans
d'autres ports commerciaux, des services de reception des eaux de cale et des
d6chets p6troliers seront etablis. Ces materiaux huileux seront transportds vers
un ou deux services de traitement contraux dans chaque pays, co qui rentabilisera
au maximum le centre de traitement at assurera une bonne qualitd du contr6le
environnemental du processus de traitement. La projet comprond la construction
et 1'equipement d'un laboratoire de contr6le pour chaque centre de
rdception/traitement des eaux de lest et pour chaque centre de traitament des
eaux de cale/dtchets petroliers.   Ce laboratoire permettra de controler la
qualitd des effluents, et de vdrifier/rapprocher les donnees relatives au type
et A La quantite des produits traites devarnt etre conformes aux normes
internationales  pour  les  hydrocarbures,  soit  15  mg/L.    Un  systeme  de
commercialisation des matdriaux huileux collectds et raffines sera dtudie pour
rentabiliser les investissements et assurer l'auto-suffisance financiere du
systeme de lutte contre la Pollution.
5.5         Eaux de Lest et Dechets Petroliers
Ils constituent le premier elhment des programmes nationaux et seront
dtudies en deux phases:
(i)   Phase  Pr2Daratoire:  (a) un plan national dtablissant les
priorites pour de nouvelles installatLons et pour la
rehabilitation ou l'expansion d'installations existantes,
prenant en cons id6ration le nouveau d6veloppement dans la
construction de petroliers; et (b) 1'6tude, la faisabilit6 at
I'application en Algerie, au Maroc et en Tunisie d'un systeme
de collecte et de traitement base sur l'expdrience d'autre
ports et;

5.6         Les DisRositifs Faisant Face aux DjYy rsements de Pdtrole en Jar. x.:
deuxi&me element des programmes nationaux   ;STra r6alisd en deux pha e s3 W.
comprendra le ddveloppsment et la mise en oeuvru  d'un dispositif pour fa!n :.aLce
au deversement de petrole en mer et d'un plan de sensibilisation a l'environne-
ment. Ces plans seront developpes dans un mod&ee wg6ndrique", incorporant le
concept de l'dvaluation de risques pour identifier et fixer les priorites au
niveau portuaire et national. L'assistance technique fournie par les consultants
engagds et supervises par le Comit6 tri-lateral sera utilisee pour assurer une
approche et des mdthodologies communes.
I
(i)   Phase Preparatoire: olle consLste en la finalisation des plans
nationaux,  la consolidation du systeme institutionnel,  la
formation du personnel, et l'identification des 6quipements
pour faire face aux deversements de pdtrole en mer; et
(ii)  Zbhse Inrestissement: olle consiste en la mise en place des
6quipements recommandes pour faire face aux deversement.s da
pdtrole en mer.
5.7         Contr6le et Conformitd  Il est proposd quo le mdecanisme rdguli.teur
comprenne deux 6l6ments: (a) une capacite de controle; et (b) un cadre pour la
gestion environnementale.  L'element Icontr6lew comprendra des investissemerts
dans certains laboratoires nationaux pour fournir ou ameliorer la capacit6
d'analyse afin de contr6ler les eaux portuaires et c6tibres, et les eaux
nationales et internationales y attenant. Ces investissements comprendraient la
formation de personnel et l'achat d'dquipements auxiliaires pour la collecte
d'dchantillons.
(i)   Pha.re PreDaratoire: elle couvre une etude sur les institutions
nationales et leur capacite, la dafinition de la composante
nationale du programme commun de contr6le, et la formation du
perscrr,el; et
(ii)  Phase Investissement:  elle couvre la rehabilitation ou _a
construction des laboratoires pour les hydrocarbures er. des
laboratoires auxiliaires pour la supervision des service.; di
rdception portuaires, et l'achat d'dquipements.
5.8         L'eldment "gestion de l'environnement" comprendra des mesures Tour
le renforcement des el6ments techniques dans le cadre des reglements portuaires
et nationaux. I1 comprendra aussi le ddveloppement de m6canismes de recouvrement
des coats pour inciter au respect des obligations et rdglementations par les
armateurs, et pour assurer la perennite financiere du projet. Dans chaque cas,
le CRCP travaillera en liaison etroite avec les autorites nationales competentes
pour assurer une approche, et des mecanismes communs pour controler le respect
des reglements de la part des compagnies maritimes.

ProbLAmes et Actions A Entrevrendre
5.9         Cinq problemes lids a l'environnement doivent etre resolus par des
actions approprides A entreprendre au cours de la mise en oeuvre de ce projet:
(i)   La planification de la gestion de d6chets: l'etablissement de
services de rdception pour ddchets provenant de navires dans
les ports d'essai transf6rera le probleme de la pollution des
mers  internationales  aux ports.   Las matieres  huileuses
collectees seront, soit re-raffindes, soit rdutilisees envrac
et en masse. Des nesures seront prises pour assurer quo (a)
la traitement des mati&res huileuses apr&s reception, no nuise
pas A l'environnement; et (b) que ce traitement sIint&gre dans
las plans nationaux de la gestion de dechets;
(ii) Le contr6le de l'environnement: le mdecanisme de contr6le
propose aux centres de rdception  dans les saux portuaires,
c6tieres, et les eaux nationales et internationales y
attenant, fournira des 6l6ments pernettant l'adaptation
continue de la rdglementation pour une meilleure gestion de
l environnement. Les activites de contr6le proposoes mettront
l'accent sur uns approche intdgree de la gestion des donndes;
(iii) Perennitd:  une couposante de co projet sera l'assistance
technique ndcessaire pour d6velopper les mecanismes et les
structures appropri6es pour assurer la pdrennitd financiere
des structures d'intervention et de rdcoption des produits.
Ceci comprendra des dtudes de marche et do faisabilite pour
dvaluer l re-raffinage ou des usages alternatifs des matiures
huileuses recupdr6es;
(iv)  La gestion de l'environnoment:   co projet intensifiera et
renforcera   les   reseaux   nationaux,    les   mecanismes
rdglementaires,  et   supportera une approche  commune  des
programmes de formation et de soutien technique; at
(v)   Participation: la proposition a dtd basde sur une approche
sous-regionale de la gestion de la pollution petroliere.  Cot
aspect devra Atre privildgid pendant la prdparation at l'dtude
du projet.
Les AsDects Environnementaux
5.10        Le  projet  traitera  la  question  de  la  protection  des  eaux
internationales. Le groupe de travail sous-regional cherchera a am6liorer la
gestion de la pollution des mers a travers le d6veloppement d'une approche et des
mecanismos communs, et pour permettre d'assurer le lien entre les bdnnficiaires,
le Contre REMPEC-MEDPOL A Malte.   Las composantes du projet permettront de
ronforcer et d'amdliorer los reglements portuaires nationaux, les mdcanismes
r6glementaires, et le lien entre le contr6le et la gestion de l'environnement.
Las structures de reception portuaires repondront aux normes nationales et/ou
internationales on vigueur pour la gestion et la qualite des effluents; las
mati&res huileuses rdcupdr6es seront re-raffinees ou utilisdes comae combustibles
en vrac, dans le cadre des programmes locaux et nationaux de gestion de ddchets.
Si cola s'avAre approprie, la manutention et le traitement subsequents des



Page 9 of 13
matieres huileuses recuperees serviront de modele A la ricupdration ri'autres
ddchets huileux (par exemple, des huiles provenant de vdhicules) et v.e cette
maniere favoriseront d'autres programmes de gestion de ddchets.
VI. FINANCEMENT DU PROJET
6.1         L'objectif du projet propose dans les ports  de l'Algerie, du Maroc
et de la Tunisie ost de demontrer des bdn6fices A tirer d'un SYSTEME de gestion
de la pollution, la prioritd etant donn6e A la contamination petroliere. Los
investissements  proposds comprennent: (a) moyens de rdception des dechets
provenant de navires; (b) dispositifs I mettre en place pour traitor lea
deversements de pdtrole en mer; et (c) syst&mes pour vdrifier et contr6ler
l'environnement. Ces investissements   no sont pas justifiables A l'chelle
nationale sans le financoment supplemontaire du FEM et d'autres formes
d'assistance concessionnaire.  Le projet servira en outre a intensifier les
efforts multilatiraux dans la gestion de la pollution pdtroli&re par la creation
d'un Comit6 sous-regional.  Par le biais de ce Comitd, il sera possitle de
renforcer leas institutions nationales et realiser en commun des investis-.ments
dans le cadre d'une coopdration et approches regionales. Les services Tkationaux
d6velopperont  les  regles       fondamentales  rdgissant  la  protection  de
l1environnement.
6.2         Le budget minimum est estime A 20 millions de dollars US, dont 10
millions seraient finances par l'aids concessionnaire des fonds du FEM.  La
budget restant serait complit6 par un cofinancement.   Dans le cas ou 1-
cofinancement ne serait pas disponible, leas fonds suppldmentaires seront
compldt6s soun forme de dons dans le cadre de la quatrieme ou des tranches
ultdrieures du FEK. L'extension ultdrieure dvontuelle des noyens de riception
des dtchets provenant des navires et d'ailleurs, fera l'objet de requetes de
financement aupres d'autres bailleurs de fonds.  Un dldment du projet sous-
regional traitera la question de pdrennitd du financement des extensions de facon
A ce que l'adaptation aux actions antdrieures soit assurde.
VII.  AVANCES POUPR:PAMTION DU PROJET (PPA)

2.3       Le projet propose et approuve par les trois pays (les Beneficiaires)
et le Fonds pour l'Environnement Mondial (FEM) fera l'objet d'une etude de
preparation et de mise en place. Pour respecter Les aspects cites ci-dessus, les
Bendficiaires ont crde un Comiite Regional de Coordination du Projet (CRCP) dont,
le cadre d'intervention, la composition, le fonctionnement, le responsabilite et
les objectifs sont ddfinis dans les paragraphes ci-dessous.
III. INTRODUCTION
3.1       La Mdditerranee est une mer regionale semi-close ou la degradation de
l'environnement, due a une variete d'6eements, pose ddja un probleue grave. Bien
que leas effluents industriels et les eaux usees urbaines dtgradent lea esaux
portuaires et c6tibres, une grande partie de l'impact ddfavorable sur les eaux
internationalds rdsulte du deversement par des navires des eaux huileuses (eaux
de lest et de cale), actuellement estime a representer 75 pourcent des 650.000
tonnes par an de contamination d'hydrocarbures dans la Mediterrande. Des etudes
sur la contamination d'hydrocarbures indiquent que les eaux de la Cote nord-
africaine dans la partie sud-ouest de la HMditerranee contiennent le deuxi&me
plus grand nombre de tAches de goudron, avec A peu pres 30 pour cent de pdtrole
delestd, laissant des rdsidus de goudron sur les plages algdriennes et
tunisiennes. La contamination dans leas eaux internationales a donc un impact
direct sur la conposante utourisme" de leur economie. En plus, le goudron ainsi
que ces residus peuvent souiller et dtgrader les ecosystemes fragiles et lea
pAcheries cotieres.
3.2       Bien qua, a ce jour, la partie sud-ouest de la Mdditerrande ait dtd
6pargnee d'accidents majeurs de petroliers, le niveau de risques east 61ev6. Una
circulation annuelle de 58.000 navires le long de la c6te des pays du Maghreb
inclut a peu pres 5.000 navires transportant du pdtrole, 2.000 transportant des
produits chimiques, et 1.300 transportant du GNL. Cette circulation represente
A peu pres 500 millions de tonnes d'hydrocarbures et 400.000 tonnes de produits
chimiques.
3.3       L'Algerie, le Maroc et la Tunisie sont signataires de la Convention de
Barcelone (1976) sur la lutte contre les deversements de petrole en mar, ainsi
que des Conventions MARPOL 73/78 sur le deversenent de dechets provenant de
navires. En plus, les trois pays reconnaissent qu'une approche commune aiderait
a adresser le probleme de la pollution d'hydrocarbures. Chacun des pays a exprimi
la volonte de proceder avec le projet sous-rdgional/national de la mani&re qui
suit: dans l'avenir proche, avec l'aide de la Communauti europienne, les trois
pays etudieront la faisabilite d'un service rigional pour lutter contre les
deversements de pitrole en mer. Cependant, les trois pays, sauf dans quelques
cas, manquent d'infrastructure necessaire pour fournir et pour contr6ler la
reception et le traitement des dtchets provenant de navires.   La capacite
nationale ou regionale pour evaluer et pour contr6ler la pollution pitrolibre est
limitie, en ce qui concerne A la fois les services sur le terrain ou en
laboratoire et les ressources humaines disponibles. En outre, aucun des pays ne
poss&de un dispositif national ou regional d'intervention pour lutter contre les
deversements de petrole en mer.

IV. LES OBJECTIFS DU PROJET
4.1       L'objectif principal du projet propose pour le financement par le FEH
est de reduire la propagation d'hydrocarbures aux eaux internationales de la
Mediterranee par: (a) la mise en place de services pour recevoir les dtchets a
des ports cl6s en Algerie, au Maroc et en Tunisie; (b) le renforcement de la
capacite de contrdle; et (c) l'augmentation de la capacitd pour limiter las
deversements de pdtrole en ner. La caract.tristique essentielle de ce Projet sera
le developpement et la mise en place d'un (CRCP). Ce dernier sera responsable
d'engager le Bureau d'etudes, de coordonner et de superviser la preparation et
l'ex6cution  du  projet.    Le  CRCP  assurera  une  homogeneite  d'approche,
d'equipements et de formation pour realiser les b6nefices optimaux aux dtpenses
proposdes.   I1 assurera egalement les liens necessaires entre les programmes
nationaux et le Centre de Pollution dans la M6diterran6e (MEDPOL), dont le siege
se trouve A Malte.
4.2       Le projet propose comprendra A la fois des elements sous-regionaux et
nationaux:
Au Niveau Sous-Rggional:  (i)  renforcer et mettre en oeuvre un comiti sous-
regional de travail et de coordination technique; (ii) ddvelopper et me.-tre en
oeuvre un dispositif d'intervention pour faire face aux deversements de ,itrole;
(iii) d6velopper et coordonner des mecanismes regulatoires pour la gestioz. de la
pollution; (iv) developper des approches sous-r6gionales A la gestion de donries
pour renforcer l'dtablissement de rapports sur l'etat de 1'environnement marin
et la verification de la conformit6 etux obligations nationales en la matiere; at
(v) servir de lien entre les effoxzs nationarx et MEDPOL.
Au Niveau National: (i) ameliorer/moderniser certains services de reception
portuaires pour les eaux huileuses (eaux de lest et de cale) et les dechets
pdtroliers; (ii) developper et mettre en oeuvre un dispositif d'intervention pour
lutter contre les deversements de petrole; (iii) mettre en oeuvre la capacite
necessaire pour absorber les d6versements de petrole; (iv) renforcer la capacite
nationale de contr-oer la ccnolziitd aux normes de protection de 1'environnement;
et (v) renforcer le cadre de gestion de L'environnement aux niveaux port-uaire et
opdratio..mil.
IV. DESCRIPTION DU PROJET
Les Elements Sous-R62ionaux
5.1       Les activit6s sous-regionales sont essentielles pour: (a) assurer une
approche, des politiques rdgulatoires, des methodologies et des 6quipements
communs;  (b)  promouvoir un echange  d'information  et une  mise en oeuvre
coordonnes; (c) organiser la formation; et (d) exploiter les donndes nationales
rassemblees pour evaluer les tendances r6gionales A long terme en pollution
marine, a la fois des eaux nationales c6ti6res et des eaux internationales y

attenant. Une approche tri-laterale encouragerait lVefficacit6 et la rentabilite
par le partage des services, des equipements pour lutter contre et reduire les
ddversements de petrole en mer, et les exercices d'entrainement. La composante
cle sera le dtveloppement at la mise en place d'un Comite Regional de
Coordination.
5.2       Ce Comite servira les trois pays (l'Algerie, le Haroc, et la Tunisia),
et assurera le lien avec tout le Plan de la Lutte contre la Pollution dans la
Mdditerran6e ainsi qu'avec d'autres programmes sous-rdgionaux de gestion de la
pollution.
5.3       Quatre programmes specifiques seront entrepris par un bureau d'etudes
engag6 et supervise par la Comitd de Coordination; ils fourniront un cadre
multilateral pour permettre aux programmes nationaux d'etre developpes avec una
approche commune:
Un Programme Dour le DisDositif Environnemeintal d' Intervention
et de Sensibilisation aux Diversements de Pdtrole
(i)      Ce dispositif servira premi6rement de modele pour des plans
nationaux et locaux, et deuxiemement,de lien entre des plans
nationaux.   Les elements de ce dispositif comprondront des
ressources   c6tieres   fragiles,   l'inpact   sur   divers
consommateurs d'eau, et le transport du produit ddversd i
d'autres r6gions/nations c6tibres;
Un (des) Proeramme(s) Rour Faire Face aux  Deversenents de
Petrole en Mer
(ii)      Les  elements  identifies  dans  le(s)  programme(s)  sus-
mentionne(s) ainsi que les investissements en 6quipement at en
formation seraient classes par prioritd selon une approche
d'valuation de risque. CeS plans d6finiraient le modele de
transport des deversements, les besoins sous.rTgionaux en
dquipements et ressources humaines, et l'identification de
sources  externes  d'assistance.   Utne  des  taches  du/des
programme(s) sera d'assurer que les dquipements achetds sous
des budgets/allocations nationaux  sojent communs aux trois
pays et d'entreprendre des cours de formation et des exercices
en commun.   Les actions de ce(s) programme(s) serviront A
promouvoir  encore  plus  le  concept  d'une  approche  sous-
regionale pour faire face aux d6versenents de p,trole.
* Un   (des)   Prozramme(s)   pour  DNfinir   les   Mecaniames
R6 Mulatoires, le Contr6le et la Vdrification de la Conformiti.
(iii)  I1 est important de s'assurer qu'il n'y a pas de diversion du
probleme de pollution a une autre partie de la Mdditerran6e.
Des mdcanismes regionaux se concentreront sur le d6veloppement
et la mise en oeuvre de techniques financieres pour promouvoir
la conformitd, et en m6me temps assurera la persistance des

efforts tri-lateraux et nationaux. Le contr6le regional et la
verification regionale seront centres sur le d6veloppement de
vdrification "bilan" pour lier leas quantitis signalees de
ddchets r.ocus et traitAs atx resultats de controle dans les
eaux natIcrales, dans )at eaux internationales y attenant, et

Les Eldments Nationaux
5.4       Dechets orovenant dsI  Uas_y J  s.  -Jn  grande partie de la contaminitior
petroliere des eaux internal.IonaT psuvx.ent du ddversement par des  u4vires
d'eaux de lest et de cale. Ot pocbltme d'evacuation de ddchets est dirertiment
lid A un manque absolu de moaens dans les ports, airsi qu'a la faiblesse, voir
mime l'inexistance, de n6canisma zigulatoirs.  L'4l6ment central aux composantes
nationales sera la construction ou la rehabilitation, dans les ports cl&s des
trois pays, des moyens congus pour recevoir et traiter les ddchets de lest (qui
consistent pour la plupart d'eau), des moyens pour recevoir, esmagasiner et
transporter les dechets de cale (qui generalement, ont une grande concentration
d'huile) et des moyens pour recevoir, emmagasiner et transporter les dtchets
petroliers et produits apparentes (des matdriaux dont le contenu en eau est
faible).  Des moyens pour traiter les eaux de lest sont deJa proposds par des
ports qui reQoivent la   plus grande proportion de navires etrangers ou de
cargaisons destinees A 1'6tranger: Arzew/Bethiana, Bejaia, Skikda et Alger
(Algdrie); Mohammeda (Maroc): et Bizerte (Tunisie). Bien que Mohanmeda soit _itud
sur la c6te atlantique du Maroc, ce port est l'origine ou la destination d'un
grand nombre de navires provenant de la Miditerranee et fournit le meilleur
modele operationnel pour le Maroc. Dans d'autres ports commerciaux des ser'iices
de rdception des eaux de cale et des dechets petroliers seront etablis.  Ces
materiaux seront transportds vers un ou deux services de traitement centraux dans
chaque pays, ce qui donnera la rentabilite maximale du centre de traitement et
assurera une bonne qualite du contr6le environnemental du processus de
traitement.   Le projet comprend la construction at l'dquipement d'un petit
laboratoire de controle pour chaque centre de rdception/traitement des eaux de
lest et pour chaque centre de traitement des eaux de cale/ddchets petroliers.
Ce laboratoire permettra de controler la qualite des effluents, et la
vdrifier/rapprocher les donndes relatives au type et A la quantite des produits
traitds devant etre conformes aux normes internationales pour las hydrocarbures,
soit 15 mg/L. Les matdriaux huileux collectds seront vendus, apres re-raffinage
comme combustibles dans des simples systemes de chaudiere (par exemple, des fours
en brique) pour que le projet propose puisse &tre auto-suffisant.

5.5       Eaux de Lest et Dechets Petroliers
(i)     Phase Predaratoire:  (a) un plan national dtablissant des
priorites pour de nouvelles installations et pour la
rdhabilitation ou l'expansion d'installations existantes, et
prenant en consideration le nouveau developpement dans la
construction de pdtroliers (en AlgerLe et en Tunisie); et (b)
l'etude d'un systeme de collection et de traitement bas4 sur
l'expdrience  d'autre  ports  de  la  Mdditerrande  et  la
faisabilite de son application en Algerie, au Maroc et en
Tunisie.
(ii)    Phase Investissement: (a) la rehabilitation et l'expansion des
installations d6jA existantes; (b) la construction do
laboratoires pour controler la performance des moyens de
reception et leur conformite avec MARPOL 73/78 (par rapport A
des activites natLonales de contr6le); et (c) mise en oeuvre
d'un systeme pour la collecte et le traitement des huiles de
lest, conformement aux recommandations de 1'6tude.
5.6       Les Dispositifs Faisa_t Face aux Uversenents de Pdtrol2 en Mar: Le
deuxi&me dldment des programmes nationaux sera le diveloppement et la misc en
oeuvre d'un dispositif en cas de 'idversement de pdtrole en mar, un plan de
sensibilisation a l2environnement, et des dispositifs pouvant faire face aux
ddversements de pdtrole en mer qui en resultaront.  Ces plans seront ddveloppds
dans un modele Ig6ndrique", incorporant l concept de l'dvaluation de risques
pour identifier et fixer les priorites aux niveaux portuaire et national.
L'assistance technique fournie par les consultants engagds at supervisds par le
ComitA tri-lateral sera utilisee pour assurer une approche at des mdthodologies
communes.   L'dvaluation des risques sera dgalement utilisee pour fixer les
priorites des investissements ndcessaires pour faire face aux ddversements de
pdtrole et pour les equipements de nettoyage.
gi)     Phase Preparatoire: elle consiste a la finalisation des plans
nationaux, du systeme institutionnel, de la formation du
personnel, et a l'identification des equipements pour faire
face aux d6versements de petrole en mer; et
(ii)    Phase Investissenent: elle consiste a l'achat des equipements
recommandes pour faire face aux d6versements de petrole en
mer.
5.7       Controle et Conformite.  Il est proposd quo le mecanisme rdgulatoire
comprenne deux 1elments: (a) une capacit& de contr6le; et (b) un cadre pour la
gestion environnementale. L'element "contr6le" comprendra des investissements
dans certains laboratoires nationaux pour fournir ou ameliorer la capacitd
d'analyse afin de contr6ler et verifier les eaux portuaires et coti&res, et les
eaux internationales y attenant. Dans le cas oii cela s'avererait necessaire, ces
investissements comprendraient la formation de personnel et 1' achat d'equipements
auxiliaires pour la collecte d'echantillons.



LlNEXE 7
Pagte ' of 19
(i)     Phase Prdparatoire: elle couvre uns etude des institations
nationales et de lsur capacite, la definition de la compasante
nationale du programme commun de contr6le, et la forma:Lon du
personnel;
(ii)    Phase Investissement: elle couvre la rdbabilitation ou la
construction de laboratoires pour leas hydrocarbures et de
laboratoires auxiliaires pour la supervision des services de
rdception portuaires, et l'achat d'dquipements.
5.8       L'dldment "gestion de lenvironnement' comprendra des mesures pour le
renforcement des dldments techniques dans le cadre des rbglements portuaires et
naticnaux. Ceci comprendra le dtveloppement de mdcanismes de recouvrement des
coAts pour promouvoir le respect des obligations et regles par las armateurs, et
pour assurer la pdrennitd financi&re.  Dans chaque cas, le groupe de travail
sous-rdgional travaillera en liaison dtroite avoc des unites nationales et
portuaires pour assurer une approche, et des m6canisues communs pour contr6ler
le respect des rbglements de la part des compagnies maritimes.  Cot 6l6ment
servira de modale pour d'autres actions nationales de reglementation de
l'environnement (par exemple, la pollution de lair).
Des El6ments Innovateurs
5.9       L',lement innovateur principal de ce projot aera la formation d'un
Comit6 tri-lateral pour d6finir l'approche et las mdcanismss communs pour la
gestion de la pollution marine qui serviront de modbla pour leas efforts
nationaux. Ce Comitd sera dgalement le lien avec d'autres comitds rdgiouaux et
multilat6raux de grande emvergure, et A adhdrer aux diff6rentes conventions, at
agences.  Le deuxi&me idment innovateur sera l'utilisation de la methode de
l'dvaluation de risques, bas6e sur l'dvaluation des possibilitds de ddverseusnts
de pdtrole et sur la sensibilisation A l'environnement pour fixer les priorites,
orienter la planification pour limiter et pour lutter contre leas deversoments,
et definir les investissements subsequents.
Actions A Entreorendre
5.10      Cinq actions doivent etre entreprises au cours de la mise en oeuvre de
ce proj et:
(i)     La planification de la gestion de dechets: l'dtablissement de
services de reception pour ddchets provenant de navires dans
les ports d'essai transfArera le probl&me de la pollution des
mers  internationales  aux ports.   Las matieres huileuses
collactdas seront, soit re-raffindes, soit rdutilisdes come
combustibles en vrac et en masse. Des mesures seront prises
pour assurer que: (a) le traitement des mati-res huileuses
apres reception, ne nuise pas a I'environnement; et (b) quo
celui-ci s'integre dans les plans nationaux de la gestion de
dechets;



ANNEXE 7
Page 10 of 19
(ii)    Le  contr6le  de l'environnement:  le contr6le propose  aux
centres de reception et dans les eaux portuaires, c6tibres, et
les eaux internationales y attenant, fournira au ddveloppement
de la rdglementation et A la gestion de l'environnement un
mecanisme  de rdtroactivite.    Los  activitds  de  contr6le
proposdes mettront l'accent sur une approche integrde de la
gestion des donnees, ces dernieres fournissant les elements
essentiols pour un 'bilann environnemental de la pollution
petroliere;
(iii)   Perennite:  une composante  de ce projet sera l'assistance
technique necessaire pour ddvelopper les mDcanismes et les
structures appropriees pour assurer la perennitd financibre
des  services  et de l'organisation  sous-rdgionale.   Ceci
comprendra des etudes de marchd et de faisabilite pour dvaluer
le re-raffinage ou des usages alternatifs des matieres
huileuses recupdrees. De tels m6canismes seront formules pour
encourager la conformitd aux normes;
(iv)    La gestion de l'onvironnement: la solution technique a la
contamination petroliere par des deversements provenant de
navires   ddpend  largement   d'uno   gestion  efficace  do
1'environnement, tant au niveau national que sous - rdgional. Ca
projet intensifiera et renforcera las reseaux nationaux et les
micanismas  rdglementaires,  et  egalement  supportera  des
programmes de formation at de soutien technique pour assurer
uns approche commune; at
(v)     Participation: la proposition a dtd basee sur une approche
sous-rdgionale a la gostion de la pollution pdtroli&re. Las
trois gouvernements ayant exprim6 leur volontd de participor,
les actions proposees ci-dessus seront finalis6es pendant la
phase de prdparation du projet.

6.1       L'objectif  du  projet propose  dans  les  ports mediterraneens  de
l'Algdrie, du Maroc et de la Tunisie est d'illustrer les bdndfices d'un SYSTEME
de gestion de la pollution, la cible initiale dtant la contamination petroliere
comme  polluant  primaire.    Les  investissements  pilotes  proposes  dans  le
d6veloppement/extension des: (a) moyens de reception des ddchets provenant de
navires;  (b) dispositifs a mettre en place pour traiter les d6versements de
p6trole on mer; et (c) systemes pour vdrifier et contr6ler l'environnement, ne
sont pas justifids A 1'dchelle nationale sans le financement suppldmentaire du
FEM et d'au.tres formes d'assistance concessionnelle. De plus, le projet servira
a intensifier et a elargir des efforts experimentaux multilateraux vers la
gestion de la pollution petroliere a travers l'dtablissement d'un Comitd sous-
rdgional.   Dans le cadre de ce Comite, il sera possible de renforcer las

Page 11 of 19
institxitions nationales at rdaliser  des investissements dans un cadve de
coopdration et d'approches communes.   Les services nationaux permetttont le
ddveloppement des principes fondamentaux sur l'environnement, dtablirort des
composantes dcosystmens appropri6es, et ddvelopperont des programmes sur I9dtat
de l'environnement marin. Ce prQcessus d'information sera coordonn6 et ded* loppi
d'une maniere uniforme par le Comitd sous-rdgional qui, a son tour, sera *Le lien
& l'ensemble du Plan d'Action sur la Pollution dans la HMditerranee (MEOPOL),
dont le si&ge se trouve a prdsent A Malte..
6.2       Le budget minimum east estimd A 20 millions de dollars US, dont 10
millions seraient finances par l'aide concessionnelle des fonds du FEM.  Le
budget restant serait complete par un cofinancement.   Dans le cas ou le
cofinancement ne serait pas disponible, le- fonds suppl6mentaires seront demandes
dans le cadre de la quatrieme tranche du FE.M. L'extension subsequente des noyens
de reception pour dtchets provenant de navires et d'ailleurs, fera l'oblet de
requdtes de fiziancement auprbs d'autres bailleurs de fonds. Un dldment du projet
sous-rigional traitera la question de pgrennit& du financenent des extensions de
facon A ce que la conformitd aix actions antdrieures soit assurde.

Consistance de l'6tude (Lot 1)
9.3        Les differentes activites de l'dtude peuvent etre subdivisdes en q-atre
parties:



ANNEXE7
Page 16 of 19
(i)     Analyse et diagnostic:
La convention internationale pour la prdvention de la
pollution par les navires "MARPOL 73/78" interdit toute forme.
de rejet des eaux polluees A la mer, sauf si les petroliers
remplissent les conditions edictees par la regle no. 9 de la
dite convention. Si ces conditions ne sont pas rdunies, les
eaux polluees de citernes doivent etre conservees A bord pour
etre ddchargees dans des installations de reception portuaires
qui sont regies par la regle no. 12 de la MHARPOL 73/78" et
notanment son paragraphe "2 b".   Le Bureau d'Etudes doit
fournir une description et une analyse detaillees, identifier
les lacunes d'information, et faire les recommandations
ndcessaires a ce sujet, notamment pour les points suivants:
(a) les donnees physiques du littoral et du milieu marin
algerien, marocain et tunisien; (b) les ressources naturelles
littorales et marines; (c) inventaire du materiel pour assurer
la sdcurite dans les ports et les installations off-shore, la
surveillance, le contrple et la protection de l'environnexent
marin (matdriel de communication et de surveillance, materiel
d'6chantillonnage pour le controle de la teneur des eaux en
hydrocarbures, matdriel de prevention disponible: station de
ddballastage, separateur au niveau des navires, materiel de
lutte contre la pollution et les moyens d'appui necessaires,
(barrages flottants, ecremeurs, analyseurs et separateurs au
niveau des plate-formes, 6quipes de s6curit6 par ports et par
plate-formes, et autres moyens d'intervention); et (d)
inventaire   des   organismes   responsables   de  la  lutte
antipollution par les hydrocarbures dans les trois pays ainsi
que le materiel dont ils disposent.
Le rapport diagnostic devrait inclure les annexes suivantes:
* - un tableau detaille du trafic petrolier;
-    un tableau detaille des accidents anterieurs;
-    une  liste  des  organismes  responsables  de  la  lutte
antipollution par les hydrocarbures dans les trois pays;
leur fonction, ainsi que la liste du matdriel dont iLs
disposent; et
-    les recormandations pour l'amelioration de la situation
actuelle.
A la suite de cette approche, Le Bureau d'Etudes devra faire ressortir les
defaillances constatees et emettre des recommandations pour ameliorer la
situation.
Cii)    Evaluation des besoins:
A la suite du recensement des moyens disponibles, le Bureau
d'Etudes identifiera les structures institutionnelles a mettre
en place, les besoins en equipements et en materiels pour



Page 17 of 19
doter 1'Algerie, le Maroc et la Tunisie de moyens suffisants
en matiere de surveillance, de contrble et de protection des
cotes et du milieu marin notamment pour pouvoir intervenir
efficacement en ^as d'urgence pour lutter contre une pollution
par les hydroca-lures.  Le recensement devra tenir coa.pte en
priorite des moTe.as .:iisceptibles d'amdliorer la pre-ention
(equipement des i-av':.-c algeriens, marocains et tunisien,s et
des plate-formes par des separateurs, dimensionnewent de
stations de deballastage).  II devra egalement tenir compte
des moyens pouvant etre mis en place a partir d'autres pays
mediterraneens pour -%tAter contre une pollution acciientelle
majeure. En fonction du materiel existant et des propositions
d'equipement, le Bureau d'Etudes devra prevoir une formation
des cadres et techniciens algeriens, marocains et tunisiens
pour assurer d'une maniere efficace l'utilisation et la
maintenance du matdriel.
(iii)   Plan Regional d'Urgence:
A la suite de toutei les investigations qu'il aura entreprises
at des information: r.u'il en aura tir6es, le Bureau d htudes
proposera pour chaque pays un Plan National d'Urgence en cas
de pollution accideittelle par les hydrocarbures.  Ces plans
devront s'int6grer dans un Plan d'Urgence Regional et prendre
en consideration dans ux premier temps les zones a proteger en
prioritd et les moyens disponibles. I1 devra &laborer at
tester un schema d'intervention en spdcifiant leas opdrateurs
d'alerte, de coordination et de conduite des operations de
lutte en mer et sur le littoral ainsi que leur syst6me
d'organisation.
(iv)    Evaluation des coutts d'investissement:
Compte tenu des besoins identifies pour doter le pays de la
logistique et des dispositifs necessaires a la protection du
milieu marin et a la lutte contre la pollution par les
hydrocarbures, le Bureau d'Etudes fera une evaluation des
couLts  d'investissement   ndcessaires,   aussi   bien   pour
l'acquisition  de  tous  les  equipements,  que  pour  le
fonctionnement du plan d'urgence elabore (coAt en devises et
coat local).  Par ailleurs il devra considerer les couts de
conception necessaires (de l'avant-projet sommaire jusqu'au
dossier   d'appel   d'offres   complet,   y   incluses   lsa
specifications  techniques  detaillees  des  6quipewel-s  &
acquerir) et presentera un calendrier d'acquisiticra des
equipements.  Celui-c. tiendra compte d'une part des delais de
conception et d'acquisition des dquipements et d'autre part
d'une priorite a etablir entre les diffdrentes acquisitions
proposees en fonction de l'importance, de l'urgence et des
contraintes financieres.   Cette evaluation doit prencr  en
compte les produits et equipements les plus opportc.L en

PROJET DE GESTION DE LA POLLUTTION PETROLIERE
EN MEDITERRANEE OCCDENTALE
L'ALGERIE, le MAROC et Ia T1UNISIE ont obtenu un don du Fonds fiduciaire pour la
protution de r'envionnement g6r6 par la Banque Mondiale. L'atiribudon de ce don
suppose que soient respectees um certain nombre de conditons pari lesquelles figure
l'elaboration d'une etude de 'iimpict des mesures envisagies par les trois pays sur
1'environnenent. Cette 6tude fait r'objet de la presente note qui s'articulera en quatre
points:
o     Evaliatortn de la situation initiale,
*     Recommandations pour ram6lioration de la situation,
*     Impact attendu de ces recommandatons,
o     Suite a donner A Ia premiexe tranche d'iinvestissements.
I.-  EVALUATION DE LA SITUATION NIMTIALE
L'etude a permis de mettre en e'vidence dans les trois pays un certain nombre de
lacunes prtjudiciables a la qualit6 de 1'environnement. Ces lacunes concement
aussi bien les mesures de pr&vention que les mesures de pr6partion A la lutte.
I.1.-  INSUFFISANCE DES MESURES DE PREVENTION DES POLLU-
TIONS
La prdvention dans son ensemble peut etre considWrte comme
insuflisante, qu'ii s'agsse des moyens destin6s a assurer la securit6 de la
navigation ou des moyens destihs A assurer la sicurJtA des op6rations
pioli6res.

1.1 .1- Carences dans le contr6le et l'assistance de la navigation
Aucun des toi. pays de l'itude ne disposait (et ne dispose toujours) des
installations necessaires au contr8le de la navigation hauturi&e. Ces
installations, gr&cc aux nombreuses fonotions qu'elUes assurent, 6ont
pourtant des auxiliaires indispensables pour l'am6lioration de la securit6
et de l'efficacit6 du tafc et La protection de l'environnement.
De meme aucum des pays ne poss6de de moyens de remorquage assez
puiss=U puur ef aZueclts i l'assistance des navires en difficult6. Le
consultant reconnalt cependant que cette assistance est ume solution riche
qui ne s'impose pas forc6ment dans les pays de 1'6tude qui ne constituent
pas des zones i hauts risques.
L1.2.- Insuffisance des moyens destines a assurer Ia sicurit6 des
operations p6troliercs
'examen a porti surr:
3  les stations de d6batastage,
3  la recuperation des dechets huileux produits par les navires,
4 les appontements pitrolies,
Q  les laboratoires.
Stations de d&ballastage
Deux types de deficiences ont 6t6 constatees:
un certain nombre de stations fernies en raison de ler
obstuction par des boues et sediments, ce qui peut inciter
les petroliers i rejeter leurs eaux de balUast i la mer avant
d'aniver dans le port de chargement;
les deb rnjets par certaines sdions i des taux prohib6s et
qui sont donc, eux aussi prejudiciables i la bonne qualite
du milieu mann.
Ddchets huileux
Si la TUNISIE dispose d'un systime de collecte des huiles de
lubrification qui ne ripond quo particileent aux objectifs de
protecion de 1'enviromnement, 1'ALGERI  et le MAROC sont



ANNEX 8
Paqe 5 sur 14
d6pourvus de tout dispositif de ricuperaton a terre.  es navies
sonT donc tenets de rejeter leurs residus huileux i la mer,
nota=nmmt la parie liquide de ces rcsidus.
A.ppon2temhents peJtrolrs
Les appontements pitroliers devraient tous etre 6quipes de bras de
chargement permettant des deconnexions ou des vidanges rapides
en cas de fausse manoeuvre. C'est une solution id6ale qutil serait
souhaitable de generaliser en l'etalant dans le temps.
Laboratoircs
L'amxlioration de 1'equipement des laboratoires n'est pas de nature
a accroiftre ]'efficacit6 des mesures de prevention mais a disposer
dinforrnations plus pr6eises sur la qualit* du milieu man. C'est i
ce title quLe Q- a lioimLiun.s setrolLt itusiie:s.
I.2.-  INSUFF1SANCES DANS LA PREPARATION A LA Lt7F=E
L'analyse du consuilnt a port6 egalement sur l'etat de preparation de
chacun dcs pays i la lutte oontre les pollutions accidente}les. Ont amsi
6 plus specialement examines:
l'edstence de plas= nationax d'urgence,
1 'existence de stocks de matiriels,
t la formaten des personnels.
L2.1.- Plans nationaux d'urgence
Debut 1993, 1'ALGCERIE possedait un projet de plan d'urgence datant de
1990 et le MAROC avait entepris I'61aboraton du sien. La TUNISIE
quant a elle n'avait aucun plan en prnjet.
Cependant, 1'analyst des pollutions accidentelles survenuCs dans les trois
pays demontrait lYxistence de stractures administraives capables de
ripondre i des pollutions.



ANNEX 8
Page 6 sur 14
I.2.2.- Stocks d'equipements
Aucun des trois pays ne disposait de stock national d'`quipements de
lutte conti les pollutions. Seules &taient 6quipdes quelques entreprises
portuaires et les soci6t6s de prospection p iroliere.
Alors que la rapidite d'intervention est un des facteurs importants de la
reussite des oprations de lutte, l'absence d'&quipements mettait, la
plupart du temps. lEtat pollu6 a la merci du pollueur.
L2.3.- Formstion de porsonnels
La meie carence a tet constat6e dans les tois pays pour ce qui conceme
la fomation des personnels a la lutte contre les pollutions accidcatelles
et cette carence peut etm lourde de cons6quences dans la mesure oi lc
pcrsonncl cst incapabic i la fois dc prendrc lcs bonncs options tcchniques
et dappr6cier le bien-fond6 des options techniques prises par d'autres
acteus.
*5    *     *
En resumh, la situation est preoccu-pante dans les tris pays. Ce constat
doit, cependant, &tte tempdr6 par la conscience aigue que Its autorit6s
responsables de 1'ovironncmcnt ct dcs scetcurs port2aircs ont de 1a
situation et par leur disix dy rem6dier.

I.- RECOMMANDATIONS POUR L'AMELIORkTION DE LA SITUA-
TION
A la suite de ce diagnostic, l;etude a propose un certain nombre de mesures en
vue d'am6liorer la situation. Ces mesures se r6partissent en propositions
d'invtsfissm3cMnt3, cn propositions d'orgaxisation  ct cn rccomnmandations
techniques.
11.1.- PROPOSITIONS DLN VESTISSEMENTS
Pour chacune des deficiences identiflees, 1`tude a propose la r6alisation
d'invesfissements destines a redresser la situation.
La totalit6 des investissements preconisis repr6sente ce qui serait
n6cessaire pour couvrir l'ensemble des besoins recens6s, i savoir:
105 850 000 dollars pour IALrGERIE.
6 1 985 000 dolars pour Ie MAROC,
67 981 000 dollars pour la TUNISIE.
La tranche de cr6dit finacee par =n don du FEM  (20 MS) permet de
lancer le processus de protection du milieu marin par la reduction
signifcative des hydrocarbures dtverses en mer. Les choix qui ont t
faits dans le cadre de ce cr6dit refl6tent la volont6 des autorit6s des trois
pays d'am6liorer la prevention et de mieux se preparer a la lutte:
-  en mettant en place une reglementation et une organisation
appropri6es,
-3 en s'6quipant de mat6riel dintervention,
; en formant leur personnel dans des stages communs.
Au dela de ces pr6nec-apatint:cs emmines, chaque pays a souhaitW
cormiger les distorsions les plus flagrantes:              x
cj 1'ALGERIE en remettant en ctat une des stations de
deballastage d'ARZEW, en s'equipant en maten'el de laboratoire et
en installant sur son tcrritoirc 3 systmc`3 dc surveillance du trafic,
; le MAROC en relevant le niveau de la statior de
MOAMMIEDJA..
1- la TUNISIE en developpant son systtme de recup*ration de
dechets huileux.
T'cnscmblc dc ce3 investissements atteint les 20 millions de dollars
allou&s par le FEM.



ANNEX 8
11.2.- PROPOSiTIONS D'ORGANISATION                        Page 8 sur 14
Dans le prolongement des propositions dSivestssements, rdtude a
pe.mis:
cX d' laboirer le plau national d'urgenvc de la TUNISMI,
 de donner un avis sur les plans nationaux d'urgence r6digis par
1'AJGERIE et le MAROC,
c; d'Vlaborer un projet d'accord de coop&ration et d'assistance
entre les trois pays,
,;P de preparer un plan Regional d'urgence.
11.3.- RECOMMANDATIONS TECHIIQUES
D)anm ce cadre im certain nambre de recommandations tachniques ont ite
formulies. Celles-ci ont port6 sur:
A l'ilimination des boues et des sediments prodnits par les
stations de dbaLlastage,
9 la collecte et le traitement des residus huileux produits par les
navires,
A ia mise en place d'un reseau regional d'observation de la
qualitd du milieu marin.
m.- EIPACT DE CES PROPOSITIONS ET RECOMMANDATIONS SI)R
L'ENVIRONNEMENT MARIN
L'objectff final recherche par la realisation du projet est dans un premier temps,
de limiter l'extension de la pollution par le respect des normes MARPOL en
matidre de rejet des effluents et ulteineurement de reconqucrir la qualitc de la
MEDITERRANEE Occidentale. I1 est expose ci-avr6s la fa9on dont 1c3
investissements retenus, l'organisation pr6conis6e et les recommandations
effectuies peuvent contribuer a la r6alisation de ces objecdfs en distinguant
denx domaines particuliers:
>  laprtvention,
> la preparation i la lutte.



ANNEX 8

iIIl.- EFFETS BENEFIQU7ES DES MESTJRES DE PREVENTION
Les trois pays ont adopte un certain nombre de mesures de pr6vendon
dont les effets devraient se faire sentir sur la qualite du milieu marn.
Nous examinerons ces mesu=s en reprenant le mEmc plan quc ci-dcssus
MMl..- Amelioratioa du contr81e de la navigation
L'ALGERI:E a demand6 l'installation sur son littoral de 3 systemes de
controle de la navigation (V.T.S. Vessel Tnffic Services)
;  1 V.T.S. c6tier a ALGER,
a  2 V.T.S. portuaires a ARZEW et SKIKDA.
La mise en service de ces 3 instllatdons dewaient, incontestablement,
ameliorer les conditions de navigation le long du littoral algenen et dans
les ports et ainsi r6duire les risques d'accidents.
Le V.T.S. c6ier d'ALGEIT pourrait meme devcnir =re piecc mairessc du
dispositif maghrebin, dans la mesure oui occupant une position centrale
dans ce dispositif il sera a la croisee des informations en provenance des
deux pays voisins ou vers ces pays.
LMimplantation dun V.T.S. i ALGER devait enf n pe.mee d'avoir une
idee assez precise du tafic de.produit dangereux le long du littoral des
trois pays si ceuxs-ci itposent dans leur legislation nationale, robligation,
pour les navires transportant des corgaisons dangercuses, de signaler
leurs mouvements.
Le MAROC et la TUNISIE avaient deja, avant la r6alisation de I'Atude,
etabli le projet d!installer unl TS sur leur littoral.
M.1.2,- Am6lioration de ln sicurit6 des operations p&trolieres
Cetne amelioration devrait pouvoir ete atteinte par:
;  la r6habilitation des stations de deballastage hors service ou
infdrieuwes aux uvit:s,
Q  la mise en place dans les trois pays de systemes de collecte des
d6chets huileux produits par les navires.

Stations de dblatg
La remise en service de la station n 3 d'ARZEW devrait se traduire par
l'accroissement des capacites de reception d'eaux de ballast en ALGERIE
et par contrecoup par ls reduction des rejets en mer effectues par les
p6troliers.
La rdhabilitation de la station de MOHAM EDILA permettra d'accroitre
ses capacit6s et d'atteindre progressivement les nonnes admises en
mati6re de rejet d'effluents. Pour l'cnsemble dcs stations en service, se
posera desormais la question du traitement des boues et sediments. Le
consultant pricoise que cette operation se fasse r6gulikment pour
eviter l'encombrement des bacs par les sediments et que le traitement des
boues chargees en hydrocarbures se fasse par meange a la chaux. Ce
proc6dd presente un certain nombre d'avantages:        I
Q; neutralisation des hydrocarbures et elimination du risque de
migration de cts hydrocarbures,
vaporisaton de l'eau contenue dans les boues et dlimination
du risque de pollution par le retour i la mer de cette eau.
C.olle.te des dechets huileux
Lo systeme de collecte mis en place en TTJNISIE se traduira par uie
reduction de la pollution en haute mer au large de ce pays, les navires
n'ayant plus la tentation de rejeter ces rsidus en mer avant d'arTiver au
port.
III.2.- AMETIORATION DE LA PEPARATION A LA LUTTE
Un certain nombre de d6cisions vont prochainement entrer en vigueur
dans les tois pays:
> adoption d'un plan national d'urgence,
' constitution de stocks d'equipement et de produits dispersa3ts,
L fonnation dupersonnel.
De pl-us les trois pays
4  ont 'Ilaborc un accord de coop6mtion et d'assistancv on cas de
pollution accidentelle,



ANNEXE 8
Page 11 sur 14
 ont prevu de constituer un reseau d'evaluation de la qualite du
milieu mann,
 elaboreront et adopteront un plan R6gional d'urgence.
M.2.1.- Les plans nationaux d'urgence assureront la mise en place
dams chaque pays d'une organisation adaptc aux intcrvntions contc Ics
pollutions accidenWteles et pennettant d!accroltre refficaciti des equipes
oprationnelles.
M.Z.2.- Des stocks d'6quipement et de prodults dispersants seront
constituis dans chacun des pays, entreposes en priodt6 dans les ports
ptobers et judicieusement disposes tout le long du littoral. Bien qutil
soit essentiellement axe sur lQ protection des enceintes portuaires, le
materiel de lute dont 1'acquisition est envisagie permetha egalement les
mterventions en haute mer et sur le littoral.
Bnceintes portuaizes
Les equipements retenus par les autorites portuaires des trois pays
trouveront leur uilisaion en cas de pollution accidentelle mais aussi
dans le cadre du fonctionnement habituel ; la propret& des plans d'eau
devrait donc s'en touver gandement amdliorde.
Littoral
Sur le littoral. des zones sensibles ont 6t dfinies par le consultant ; elles
poirrmnt etre protegees en pricrit6, parriellement du moins, par le
materiel figurant dans les stocks.
Haute mer
Le mat6riel prNru permeta de mettre en oeuvre les deux techniques de
lutte generalement utlisees pour la lutte en mer: la r6cupdration et la
dispersion.
La r&uptratioxi cvubistv ua elimincr lI polluant de lI surfie dc reau,
genmralement par des moyens m6caniques. L'utilisation de cette
technique a donc des r6percussions directes sur le retour a lr6tat normal
d'un milieu pollue.

Pa.q-e 1-7sur 14
A noter que le preq1.iipement ci'tn certtin rniohre de rtavif-ee; levalt
pemettre une reponse plus rapide et plus efficace.
L'utlisaton de pro-duits dispersants est une autre technique de lurte
counante en haute mer qui consiste a epandre sur les nappes
dhydroQarbures des substanoes ohimiques specialement convues pour
accE16rer le fractionnement du p6trole et sa d6gradation dans l'eau. L'une
des consequences les plus bdn6fiques pour l'ennixonement est la
dissehmination des hydrocarbures dans la colonne *eau et leur dispersion
progressive, cc qui bite d'avoir a les collecter, a les tansporter en mer, A
les stocker 'a tene et a les Lraiter pour les Iiiiner.
III.2.3.- Formation du personnel
Les membres du CRCP ont manifeste ties fennement leur intenton de
former en commun leur personnel sp&cialise dans les opirations de lutte
pntre les pollutions. Cette formation sera dispensee aux differents
niveaux prvus pour les interventions (gession de cnise, direction de
chantier de lutte, executant) et am6liorera refficaciti du personnel.
M.2.4.- Accord de cooperation et d'assistance et plan regional
d'urgence
En attendant Nl'aboration d'un Plan Rgional de Cooperation les
organismes portuaires des trois pays ont d6cidd dc s'=gagcr a sc portcr
mutuellement assistance en cas de pollution accidentelle et de coop&rer
dans le domaine de la pr&vention des accidents. Line telle initiative ne
peut qu'avoir des effets bhnefiques en favorisant la mise en comTnrnn de
personnels ayant re9u une formation identique et d'equipements adapt6s.
Le renforcement de cette coop6raton sera assurc par l'adoption du Plan
Rzgional d'urgence.
M.2.5.- Criation d'un reseau regional d'observation de la qualiti du
milieu marin
Cc reeau, s'appuryant sur lc5 laboratoires existants ou en cours de
crcation dans les pays de l'6tude permettra de ccnnaitre a tout instant la
qualite du milieu mann et surtout de suivre l1'volution de cette qualite
dans le ternps. C'est cette organisation r4ionale qui, en d6finitive,
sanctionnera les r6sultats des investissexnents 6nanc6s par le FEM en
metant en dvidenoe l'amulioration ou la d6t6xioration de la qualite des
eaux en MEDITERRANEE Occidentale.

IV.-  SUITE A DONNER A CES JIVESTISSENIENTS
L'6tude avait ivalu6 a 235 millions de dollars le montant des investissements
n&cessaires a rialiser dans les trois pays pour cou'Tir la totalitd des besoins
recesis pour la depoUution et la protcction pcrmieante de la region Sud-Ouest
de la MEDITERRANEE.
La premiere tranche de 20 millions de S identifiee pour le firnancement d'une
op6ration pilote par un don du FEM pennet de combler un =rtain nombre de
besoins prioritmires pour la prEvention des acuidtait et le Lraitemeat des
pollutions par hydrocarbures Cependant, il faut bien admettre que les choix
effectues par les pays ne sont que des compromis entre des investissements
souhait6s et des ressources lixitees. I1 n'en reste pas zaois que les premiers
investissements retenus devraient avoir, rapidement, des effets bin6fiques sur le
milieu mann. Meme si ces effets ne sont que partiels ils sont cependant
significatis dans la mesure oh ils representent le point de depart d'une action
qui devtait se d6rouler sur plusiewrs ann6es et couvrir la quasi-totalite des
besoins revensis.
La poursuite de cette action devrait porter sur:
,   1'elargissement et la gen6ralisation de la rdcup6ration des dechets
huileux dans les tois pays,
'; la rehabilitaion et 1'extension des stations de deballastage existantes
et la construvtun dr, auvc1ll staions,
P 1'extension dua reseau de syst6mes de controle et de gestion de la
navigation,
  1'6quipement des ports petroliers en bras de chargement,
 l'elargissement des capacites de reception a tous les types de d6chets.
L'accomplissement de ce programme d'action par l'identification et la r6alisation
de tranches successives d'investissements fera de la rive magbrebine de la
MEDITERRANZI  um modele en matiEre de preven:tion des accidents tc luttc
conTe les pollutions.
