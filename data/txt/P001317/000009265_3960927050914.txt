MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDYT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A RURAL SERVICES DESIGN PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed development credit to Kenya for
SDR 15.5 million (US$20.8 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years and
made available as a grant to the participating Ministries, with the exception
of funds for agricultural credit which would be on-lent to the Agricultural
Finance Corporation (AFC). The Credit will help finance a Rural Services
Design Project. The project would be cofinanced by UNDP for US$5.0 million
equivalent on a grant parallel financing basis.
2.      Background.  Agriculture is the dominant sector of Kenya's economy,
accounting for about 30X of the Gross Domestic Product. About 85X of the
population is rural and 702 is employed in agriculture. The sector produces
nearly all the nation's food and generates 68Z (1986) of total export earnings
(primarily coffee and tea). Since Independence, population has grown rapidly
(recently 3.92 p.a.) and Kenya's agriculture has become increasingly
smallholder-dominated (average farm size 2.3 ha). One of the biggest
challenges for Kenya's agricultural sector is to find new technologies and
management methods to raise the productivity of smallholders, get more out of
severely constrained land resources, and at the same time promote
environmental conservation. Some promising new opportunities need to be
tested on a small scale through applied research so that their merits may be
assessed rapidly, and the field testing quickly m3dified or stopped in the
event they do not succeed. This pilot approach is justified by poor
performance in the past of untested projects in Kenya, as well as by the
urgency of overcoming land and other constraints, and raising agricultural
growth rates. There is now a need for an investment and institutional
instrument which would support both design and implementation of promising
innovations through field testing and expansion on a larger scale, if proven
successful.
3.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Ba4c Group's broad strategy for
assisting Kenya's agricultural sector is to strengthen Government's capacity
to formulate and implement sound policies and supporting investments which
will accelerate sustained growth of agricultural productivity and incomes of
the rural population. While the Bank Group is supporting this strategy
through a number of traditional investments, there are some potentially
promising and viable investment concepts which necessarily require testing.
Past experience in Kenya has highlighted the need for testing such innovative
investment concepts on a limited basis prior to their large scale development.
The main rationale for this project is to provide "seed" resources through
innovative investments and implementation assistance to help Government to
adequately determine the potential benefits of strategic investment concepts
before they are expanded. This IDA Involvement will also: (a) help Government
establish an investment mechanism for implementing innovative ideas with
growth potential which otherwise may not be adequately supported because of
their small size and/or risk; (b) lhelp Governuent build a pipeline of
strategic investment projects for financing by IDA and other donors for
effective stait-up in the early 1990's; (c) strengthen Government's capacity
to implement more effectively its budget rationalization program through



2 
-._nvestment planning and evaluation procedures, and thereby, promoting
donor ccordination of priority investments; (d) help carry out the
implementation of some of the policy decisions included in the Bank-supported
Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation; and (e) provide IDA with an
instrument for operationalizing its sector work and policy dialogue in
subsectors where lending is promising, but still uncertain.
4.      Proiect Objectives.  The overall project objective is to test
effective approaches to and assess the feasibility of innovative investments
in order to resolve constraints to Kenya's agricultural development and which
offer potential for replication and for raising the productivity and incomes
of the rural population, particularly smallholders. An important and related
objective is to establish a programmatic investment mechanism and strengthen
institutional procedures and capacities to generate innovative ideas which
could be developed into concrete subprojects.
5.      Project.Description.  The subprojects selected and their design
features should meet the following criteria: strategic to the sustained
development of Kenya's rural sector; improved technical andlor improved
organizational approaches to removing sector constraints; small investment
size (less than USS 3.5 million each); better and sustained resource use; and
investment priority reflected in budgetary allocations. The proposed project
will support initially about ten already prepared subprojects which conform to
the above objectives and criteria, including: improved credit delivery
services to ranches and smallholders, including women's groups; increased
rural savings mobilization; enhanced livestock marketing; improved cooperative
management; arid and semi-arid land management and development, including
environmental rehabilitation and wildlife management/rural level agro-
processing; and monitoring and evaluation of agricultural sector strategies
and policies. Two of these subprojects may involve the collaboration of non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). The project will also provide funds to
support additional subprojects of a strategic and pilot nature, provided they
meet the agreed criteria. The project, to be carried out over 5 years,
provides funds for civil works; vehicles, furniture and equipment; training;
technical assistance; incremental operating costs; and agricultural credit.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$35.5 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$14.4 million (40Z). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C and D. respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7441-KE dated
November 23, 1988, is also attached.
6.      Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreement was reached on the
following: (a) clear criteria and screening procedures for subproject
selection and design; (b) approval by Project Review Committee (PRC) and IDA
of proposals for using unallocated funds; (c) measures to ensure that credit
to farmers by AFC is provided at positive real interest rates; (d) adequate
funds to be provided by Government and participating Ministries; (e)
accounting and auditing arrangements satisfactory to IDA; (f) appointment of
suitably qualified officers to assist the Ministry of Planning and National
Development in project implementation and coordination; (g) early
implementation of about ten priority subprojects ready for implementation in
the first 1 - 2 years of the project, some of which would be supported through
retroactive financing of up to US$1.9 million; (h) specific arrangements for



implementing an effective moaitoring and evaluation (M & E) system, including
a mid-term review of each subproject, emphasizing clear performance indicators
to help determine the merits for expansion on a larger scale; and (i)
disbursement mechanisms which awe flexible and rapid, and yet help reduce the
risk(s) of the innovative investments through ensuring sound preparation,
documentation and simplified implementation arrangements. Execution of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and AFC and establishment of
the PRC would be conditions of credit effectiveness.   Conditions of
disbursement would be: (a) for subprojects cofinanced with UNDP, financing
arrangements satisfactory to IDA; and (b) for each subproject: (i) completion
of an Implementation Report; and (ii) designation of a subproject coordinator
with suitable qualifications and experience.
7. Justification. The project's main justification is that it offers an
improved and programmatic investment mechanism for devising and testing
potentially effective approaches to tap the productive potential of farmers
and rural entrepreneurs. In addition, the subprojects, although limited in
scope, are expected to generate increased rural incomes and other tangible
benefits to the beneficiaries, most of whom will be smallholders. If these
subprojects prove to be successful, future returns from the expanded
investments are expected to be substantial.
8.      Risks.  The project's major risks vary according to subproject, but
generally involve two aspects. First, some of the subprojects may not lead to
viable solutions or approaches or may be of limited replicability. Second,
some of the executing agencies have limited institutional capacity to carry
out and evaluate and, where necessary, coordinate the innovative activities
proposed. The proposed project incorporates specific measures to minimize the
adverse effects of these risks. For the first risk, the project will helps
(a) ensure the selection of strategic subprojects through the careful
application of sound pre-determined criteria, under the guidance of a project
review committee; (b) establish clear project design and implementation
arrangements prior to start-up through the preparation of satisfactory
Implementation Reports for each subproject; and (c) reduce the scope and cost
of subproject interventions. As for the second risk, the project emphasizes:
(a) simplified implementation arrangements according to subproject involving
primarily one functional Ministry or agency; (b) essential short-term
technical assistance inputs, with strong orientation to on-the-job training of
local staff; and (c) a strong monitoring and evaluation system, including a
mid-term joint review of each subproject.
9.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
