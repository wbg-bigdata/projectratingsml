MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Madagascar
Lac Alaotra Rice Intensification Project (Credit 1337-MAG)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Madagascar -
Lac Alaotra Rice Intensification Project (Credit 1337-MAG)" prepared by the Africa Regional
Office.
While implementation took two an a half years longer than planned, the project
achieved its physical objectives of rehabilitating modern irrigation schemes and improving water
availability on traditional small schemes. Paddy yields and production have increased significantly and
the project has been instrumental in getting farmers involved in operating irrigation works by
establishing water user associations in the project area. As such, the project is rated as satisfactory.
Project sustainability, however, is not assured because of uncertainty regarding
maintenance arrangements for the civil works and political resistance to water charges. The issue of
which Government agency should be given the responsibility for maintaining the irrigation schemes
remains unresolved. Without adequate maintenance, the project may not generate the economic rate
of return of 25 percent reestimated in the PCR.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) is comprehensive and informative. No
comments on Parts I and III were provided by the Borrower but a Project Completion Report written
by the Borrower's implementing agency is available in the project files. An audit is planned jointly
with two other agriculture investment projects and an agricultural sector adjustment operation
(ASAC).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MADAGASCAR
LAC ALAOTRA RICE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1337-MAG)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Lac Alaotra Rice Intensification Project
in Madagascar, for which Credit 1337-MAG in the amount of US$ 18.0 million equivalent (SDR
16.7 million) was approved on March 22, 1983. The credit was closed on September 30, 1991, two
years and three months after the original closing date. The last disbursement was on February 20,
1992, at which time, the undisbursed balance of SDR 0.9 million was canceled.
Parallel financing was received from the Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), equivalent
to SDR 4.1 million, and from the Caisse Centrale de la Cooperation Economique (CCCE), equivalent
to SDR 9.3 million. At the time of IDA credit closing, the actual FAC contribution had increased
to SDR 7.9 million; from the CCCE loan, SDR 8.6 million had been used. 1/
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the South-Central and
Indian Ocean Department, Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III).
Preparation of this report was started during the final Bank supervision mission of the project in
March of 1991, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda
and a project completion report prepared by the implementing agency.
The Borrower was sent a copy of the PCR with a request to prepare Part II. The Borrower
did not prepare a Part II but a project completion report prepared by the implementing agency is
available in the project files.
1/    At the time of the IDA credit closing on September 30, 1991, FAC and CCCE
support was still on-going.

MADAGASCAR
LAC ALAOTRA RICE INTENSIFICATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1337-MAG)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.    Agriculture is the most important economic activity in Madagascar, supporting over 80% of
the population. It contributed about 40% to GNP and 80% to the export earnings of the economy
at the time of project preparation in 1981. At that time, the growth of Madagascar's agricultural
production was disappointing. As a result, Madagascar had to import about 175,000 tons of rice
(staple food for the Malagasy population) in 1981, which represented an important use of foreign
exchange resources. Government priorities were for the country to become self-sufficient in food
production, increase the production of cash crops for export, expand basic agro-industries to process
local raw materials, and increase rural employment. A previous irrigation project in the Lac Alaotra
area (1970-1975) was cofinanced by the Bank (Credit 214-MAG) and other donors. This project was
small and although it succeeded in expanding the irrigated area, it failed to strengthen the executing
agency (Development agency for the Lac Alaotra region, SOMALAC); project results were therefore
not sustainable.
Project Description and Objectives
2.    Project objectives were in line with the Government's agricultural objectives. The main
project objective was to increase rice production and the marketed surplus in the Lac Alaotra basin,
thereby saving foreign exchange expenditures on rice imports. Major project components were: a)
rehabilitating 25,000 hectares of modern irrigation schemes and improving water availability on 3,000
hectares of traditional small schemes; b) reinforcing SOMALAC, the public enterprise responsible
for irrigation in the Lac Alaotra region; c) strengthening the regional extension service (CIRVA) of
the Ministry of Agriculture to assist farmers in small schemes; and d) strengthening research
(FOFIFA) for seed breeding and multiplication.
3.    The project was to be financed by the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE;
mainly civil works, SDR 9.3m), the French Cooperation (FAC; mainly technical assistance, SDR
4. lm), Government (SDR 5. lm) and IDA (SDR 16.7m). The project was to be managed according
to annual work plans, making it flexible in its execution. As part of project preparation, SOMALAC
was reorganized in three semi-autonomous units: one for civil works and maintenance, one for
production and extension, and one for rice milling and marketing, all under a General Directorate,
with a view to progressively privatize some of its functions.
Project Implementation
4.    The main difficulties encountered during implementation have had to do with the functioning
of the project authority, SOMALAC. During implementation, SOMALAC was one of the public
enterprises to be restructured as part of the adjustment process. Extensive studies were carried out



iv
(one of the main reasons for the delay in the project closing date of two years and three months)
which led to (a) the elimination of SOMALAC's paddy purchase and milling monopoly and the
opening up of paddy buying to private hullers and traders; (b) the transfer of SOMALAC's extension
functions to the Ministry of Agriculture's regular extension services (CIRVA's); and (c) the transfer
of SOMALAC's maintenance role to the Ministry of Agriculture's irrigation district (CIRIR).
5.     The break-up of SOMALAC's paddy purchasing monopoly - in 1988 - has led to a
considerable increase in competition between traders, leading to better farmgate prices and to a strong
expansion of private hulling and milling. However, it also weakened SOMALAC's financial
performance to the point that Government decided, in February 1990, to do away with SOMALAC
and transfer its extension and maintenance functions to other services, as recommended in the studies.
Extension activities in the area are presently supported by the Agricultural Extension Pilot Project
(Cr. 2150-MAG). Government has yet to reinforce these services to assume their expanded role, as
foreseen in the studies, and consequently, it is doubtful whether the project's achievements can be
maintained.
Proiect Results
6.     The project has had considerable success in achieving its physical objectives. Some 31,000
hectares were rehabilitated (28,000 hectares estimated at appraisal) on schedule and without cost
overruns (in SDRs; in local currency, the cost was considerably higher due to several devaluations
during the implementation period).
7.     The effect of rehabilitation has been an increase in paddy yields by just over 50%: from an
average of 2.1 tons per hectare on the large schemes at the start of rehabilitation, to an average 3.2
tons per hectare in 1991, and from an average of 1.8 tons per hectare on the small schemes at the
start of rehabilitation to an average 2.9 tons per hectare in 1991. This has entailed an increase in
total annual paddy production from 57,900 tons in 1981 to 98,500 tons in 1991.
8.     Results have also been generally positive in getting the farmers more involved and
accountable for operating and maintaining irrigation works in their own areas.  Water User
Associations (WUAs) have been established covering the entire irrigated area, and WUAs have also
increasingly been consulted on the design of rehabilitation works. However, payment of water
charges, initially successful, has declined because of active resistance from local political interests.
9.     The economic rate of return of this project is largely positive, estimated at 25% compared
to 24% estimated at appraisal, but this is based on continued adequate maintenance of the irrigation
system which under present conditions is not assured. Without adequate maintenance, production is
likely to fall back to pre-project levels, which would imply a marginal rate of return.
Sustainabil itv
10.    Although the project was largely successful in achieving its objectives, its sustainability is in
doubt (as was the case after the first project), largely because the institutional questions have still not
been resolved. The main outstanding issue is that after dissolving SOMALAC, Government did not
create an institution capable of assuring maintenance of the main civil works (storage dams, main
canals and drains). The studies done on restructuring actually proposed one of two options to the
Government: to create an autonomous maintenance organization (preferred by the French co-
financiers) or to reinforce the existing CIRIR so as to enable it to take responsibility of maintenance



v
(preferred by the Bank). No decision on either has yet been taken, which has potentially serious
consequences for the security of storage dams and for a rapidly diminishing capacity of the
distribution and drainage network (canals and drains need to be regularly cleaned because of on-going
siltation due to erosion in watersheds). Unless such an organization is established (or the existing
CIRIR reinforced), it will not be possible to sustain the results achieved.
Lessons Learned
11.   The major lessons to be drawn from this project are:
-     Flexible project execution through annual work plans, which helped to adjust
activities during implementation and provided a mechanism for donor coordination
during supervision missions, has been a main factor in the smooth implementation
of the irrigation rehabilitation works.
The difficult and protracted process of restructuring SOMALAC has been partly due
to the fact that, at appraisal, there was no consensus on SOMALAC's ultimate role
among the donors and between donors and Government; this situation delayed the
decision to reinforce the Government's regular extension and irrigation services and
to replace SOMALAC's functions.
Pioneering work was done in establishing farmer-led WUAs and credit associations,
with largely positive results, which are now being extended elsewhere in Madagascar.
The project did include works on both large and small schemes. The results suggest
that it is preferable to concentrate on the rehabilitation of small schemes: (i) the cost
per hectare of rehabilitation is 56% lower on small schemes than on large ones
(approximately SDR 200 per hectare versus SDR 450 per hectare, respectively); (ii)
at present, paddy yields are only 10% lower on small schemes than on large ones
(2.9 tons per hectare versus 3.2 tons per hectare); and (iii) maintenance on small
schemes can be taken care of to a larger degree by farmers themselves, thus
improving sustainability.

Subsector:         Irrigation
2.    Background
2.1    At the time of project preparation in 1981, agriculture was the most important economic
activity in Madagascar and contributed about 40% of GNP, 80% of export earnings and supported
over 80% of the population. However, because of a poor policy framework emphasizing state
intervention in the economy at that time, the growth of Madagascar's agricultural production was
disappointing. As a result, Madagascar, which was used to export 10,000 to 20,000 tons of rice
through 1972, had to import about 175,000 tons of rice (staple food for the Malagasy population) in
1981, which represented a substantial use of foreign exchange resources. The Lac Alaotra basin,
with an irrigated surface of 68,000 ha at the time of appraisal, has traditionally been the largest rice
producing area in Madagascar. It provides the country with about one-third of total marketed
surplus.
2.2   Faced with poor agricultural production performance, mounting food import bills and
widespread disorganization in the provision of basic agricultural services, the Government defined
new sectoral priorities including: a) self-sufficiency in food supply (particularly rice); b) increased
production of cash crops for exports; c) expansion of basic agro-industries to process local raw
materials; and d) increased rural employment.
2.3   IDA financed three rice irrigation projects in Madagascar, including one in the Lac Alaotra
area. The Lac Alaotra irrigation project (Credit 214-MAG), was closed on June 1975. The Project
Completion Report (PCR) was issued in December 1976 and estimated the ERR at 22%, although
with a high likelihood of variation (instead of 11 % at appraisal), primarily the result of meeting the
production targets combined with sharp increases in the world market price of rice. The project
consisted of rehabilitating irrigation and drainage networks serving 4,000 ha, the construction of
irrigation and drainage networks on 6,000 ha of peat marshlands and the construction of drainage
works on 2,000 ha of peat marshlands. The project did not include any changes in the functioning
of the existing project authority, the Development Agency for the Lac Alaotra Region (SOMALAC).
It also did not pay any attention to social and land tenure aspects. The PCR criticized the project



2
design for not paying sufficient attention to the social aspects of the project and for not analyzing in
sufficient detail the financial and managerial capabilities of SOMALAC. By the end of the project,
Madagascar was in political turmoil and SOMALAC was in dire financial straits because payment
for SOMALAC's services to farmers was delayed by Government, and farmers were unwilling to
contribute to the maintenance of canal works. This situation led to a rapid deterioration of the
irrigation works in the ensuing years, and consequently to a fall in rice production, which prompted
the Government to request external financing for renewed rehabilitation.
3.     Project Objectives and Description
3.1    Objectives. The objective of the project was to increase rice production for the market in the
Lac Alaotra basin, thereby saving foreign exchange expenditures on rice imports. This would be
mainly achieved through the rehabilitation of the existing irrigation infrastructure, the supply of farm
inputs, and management and institutional technical assistance.
3.2    Components. The project, which was to be implemented over a period of five years (1983-
87), had the following components:
(a)   the rehabilitation of existing modern irrigation networks on about 25,000 ha; and the
improvement of water availability on traditional schemes on about 3,000 ha;
(b)   the reorganization of SOMALAC, the regional development company responsible for
agricultural development in the project area, through restructuring, material support,
technical assistance and training;
(c)   the support of the regional extension service (CIRVA) of the Ministry of Agriculture,
including the provision of vehicles and equipment, training and construction of a
central warehouse;
(d)   the supply of farm  inputs including paddy seed research and multiplication by
FOFIFA (research service);
(e)   the establishment of a network of gauging stations;
(f)    pilot activities aimed at increasing agricultural production;
(g)   the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation unit; and
(h)    studies related to the project and for the preparation of other agricultural projects in
Madagascar.
4.     Project Design and Organization
4.1   Preparation of the project was first discussed between Government and IDA in 1978 in the
context of the Lac Alaotra Master Plan prepared in 1976. Pre-investment studies were financed by
the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation and an accounting and management audit of SOMALAC
was carried out in 1981. Preparation took into account the experience drawn from the Lac Alaotra
Irrigation Project (Credit 214-MAG). Total project costs in the amount of SDR 35.2 million were



3
to be financed by the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE; mainly civil
works, SDR 9.3m), FAC (mainly technical assistance, SDR 4.1m), Government (SDR 5.1m) and
IDA (SDR 16.7m).
4.2    On the technical side, design of the main irrigation/drainage works was carried out by a
consulting firm. Insufficient attention was paid to soil erosion on hilly watersheds even though this
problem had already been identified at appraisal. During implementation, erosion of these watersheds
created siltation of dams and canals that had been built and increased maintenance costs of the
schemes. Modifications had to be made to minimize the effects of the erosion. This necessitated
more detailed studies and caused delays during implementation.
4.3   In terms of organization, three agencies were involved: a) SOMALAC, which had been
reorganized into three separate entities: one for engineering and maintenance, one for extension, and
one for rice milling and marketing; b) the CIRVA, the local extension service of the Ministry of
Agriculture responsible for areas outside SOMALAC's perimeter; and c) the Center for Agricultural
and Rural Development Research (FOFIFA), for seed breeding and multiplication. It was envisaged
that: a) the SOMALAC engineering and maintenance service would supervise execution of the
physical works through contractors, but, once rehabilitation was completed, the service would
decrease in size and eventually be privatized and Water Users' Associations (WUA) would take over
maintenance; and b) the SOMALAC rice marketing service would loose its monopoly and would
compete on an equal footing with other firms. This evolution of SOMALAC's organization was
thought to have been well understood during appraisal but apparently was never fully accepted by
Government, or by other donors.
5.    Implementation
5.1    Effectiveness was delayed by about 6 months for lack of Government counterpart funds to
recapitalize SOMALAC, which was a condition of effectiveness. Partly due to this delay, to changes
in civil works design, to lack of timely counterpart fund availability during project execution
(particularly in 1989), and to the studies on the restructuring of SOMALAC, the closing date had to
be delayed three times from June 30, 1989, to September 30, 1991.
5.2    The design changes proved to be important as they focussed on erosion and siltation
prevention, which have become a growing problem over the last fifteen years, as hillsides
surrounding the lake area are increasingly grazed and cultivated.
5.3    Apart from  the delayed start-up, no major problems in civil works execution were
encountered: procurement, selection of contracting firms and execution have proceeded smoothly
under the able supervision of SOMALAC, supported by technical assistance. The area on which
rehabilitation works have been completed (31,000 ha) has exceeded the appraisal estimate by about
10%. Moreover, most of the civil works were completed within the time allowed and without
exceeding appraisal estimates in SDR terms. 2/ Total project costs expressed in SDRs were 35.7
million (SDR 35.2 million estimated). However, in local currency (FMG), total cost has been about
2/    Increases in the cost of rehabilitating the large schemes as a result of the design
changes, were more than offset by decreases in the cost of rehabilitating the small
schemes. In SDR terms, the average rehabilitation cost dropped from SDR 475 per
ha at appraisal to SDR 427 per ha during implementation.



4
210% higher, which has given rise to counterpart funding difficulties; allocations from the budget
have been delayed - particularly in 1988/89 - which has contributed to delays in the final contracts
(e.g. land planning). Actual Government financing was 60 percent of the amount estimated at
appraisal (SDR 3.1 million actual versus SDR 5.1 million estimated). Financing by IDA was 95%
of the amount estimated at appraisal (SDR 15.8 million actual versus SDR 16.7 million estimated);
financing for studies and training was higher than estimated, while financing for inputs was less.
Financing by the FAC was much higher than estimated (SDR 8.1 million actual versus SDR 4.1
million estimated); financing was increased for technical assistance and for the expansion of the seeds
center. Financing by the CCCE was close to the appraisal estimate (SDR 8.7 million actual versus
SDR 9.3 million estimated).
5.4   Pioneering work was done in getting the farmer more involved ,n water management and
operation/maintenance of the irrigation network through the establishment of water-user associations
(WUAs). None existed at the start of the project; at present, the entire area is covered by WUAs.
The WUAs were set up by SOMALAC and received support from specialized SOMALAC agents.
The WUAs are organizing water distribution effectively, and handling routine maintenance on the
tertiary distribution system; they are also collecting water charges to contribute to the cost of
maintenance of the main works. Collection of user fees, which was initially satisfactory (80-90%)
has worsened to about 46% in 1991, mainly because of the appeal of local politicians, that
maintenance has to be provided by the state.
5.5    The major problem during implementation has been institutional. Although during appraisal,
SOMALAC was reorganized, the basic framework under which it operated, was left in place:
SOMALAC's paddy purchasing, milling and marketing monopoly was maintained; it paid farmers
below-market prices for paddy and out of the surplus it retained, it paid for irrigation maintenance
and part of its operating costs (including the cost of running its own extension service). When in
1986, Government complied with conditionality under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit
(ASAC; Cr. 1691-MAG), and opened up the rice trade to private traders, SOMALAC was forced
to pay considerably higher purchase prices for paddy, as it had to compete with other buyers. When
the Government subsequently imported rice in order to reduce prices for urban consumers,
SOMALAC incurred significant losses on stocks. These losses, combined with the fact that
SOMALAC's functions in collection, marketing and milling were successfully taken over by the
private sector, finally led to a Government decision, in February 1990, to do away with SOMALAC.
5.6    The decision to eliminate SOMALAC was taken after extensive studies on its restructuring
were made. A consensus was reached on the studies' recommendations to sell off SOMALAC's rice
mills and to transfer its extension service to the Agricultural Ministry's extension district (CIRVA)
of Ambatondrazaka, and the newly created CIRVA of Amparafaravola. The Agricultural Extension
Pilot Project (Cr. 2150-MAG) is presently supporting extension activities in these two CIRVAs. No
consensus could be reached, however, on whether the Agricultural Ministry's irrigation district
(CIRIR) could henceforth take care of all system maintenance, nor whether an autonomous
organization in charge of maintenance of the main works was needed, nor on the number of personnel
to be laid off.
5.7    To date, although SOMALAC nominally does not exist any more, no decisions on these
matters have been taken, in spite of repeated proposals and requests by IDA and the French co-
financiers to solve these issues urgently. As a result, adequate system maintenance is by no means
ensured.

6.    Results
6.1    The main objective of the project was to increase rice production, which has been achieved
(incremental paddy production on rehabilitated schemes has reached 34,230 tons versus an estimated
34,300 tons at appraisal) due to a 50% increase in yields (from 2.1 tons/ha to 3.2 tons/ha) and an
increase in irrigated land (31,100 ha versus 28,000 ha at appraisal). Yields are a little less than
expected at full development (in year 8 after project completion) due to the unfinished land planning
on some schemes. Land planning should be completed shortly. The extension services of the
Ministry of Agriculture (CIRVA of Ambatondrazaka) have been strengthened and have established
very good relations with farmers through on-farm demonstrations. SOMALAC's extension service
has been successful in promoting urea use and chemicals for weed control, but has been less
successful in introducing direct planting in straight lines. Two new rice varieties that are more
productive and more flexible in terms of cultivation timing, were developed by FOFIFA and
introduced to farmers. The seed multiplication center of FOFIFA was strengthened and is presently
providing enough seeds for the region and is, in addition, shipping seeds to other parts of the
country. The monitoring and evaluation activities carried out under the project yielded valuable
information that was used during project supervision.
6.2    A second objective of the project was to trigger a participation process with the farmers to
get them more involved in scheme management and maintenance. This objective has been partially
achieved through the establishment of WUAs and Credit Associations. WUA's were successfully
established on all schemes with strong assistance from the extension services of SOMALAC and the
CIRVA in order to manage water use at the farm level and plan for maintenance works for which
they would become eventually responsible. Rehabilitation of the last schemes was executed in
collaboration with the WUAs. The WUA was a new concept for Madagascar and the project can be
regarded as a good field experiment for setting up farmers' organizations. By 1991, twenty-six
WUAs had been formed. Towards the end of the project, however, an increasing number of WUA's
delayed paying maintenance dues because of interference by local politicians.
6.3    A third objective of the project was to strengthen SOMALAC while opening progressively
its civil works and marketing services to competition. As a result of the poor planning of the
restructuring, this was only partially successful. Four small local construction companies were
created in the region for the execution of rehabilitation works on the micro-schemes.  These
companies were ready to take over part of SOMALAC's civil works activities. Unfortunately, as the
implementation of the restructuring of SOMALAC was delayed, these construction companies moved
to other regions to find other markets, or went bankrupt. The marketing of rice was quickly taken
over by the private sector, after lifting SOMALAC's monopoly.
6.4    Although not planned at appraisal, the project made a special effort to create Credit
Associations which could borrow funds to finance seeds, fertilizers, and equipment from the
Agricultural Credit Bank (BTM) on an individual basis but with collective guarantees. The volume
of credit distributed to farmers belonging to Credit Associations is growing and the rate of
reimbursement to BTM is close to 100%. Yields of farmers in Credit Associations (primarily on the
large schemes) are significantly higher than the average yield (4.5 t/ha versus 3.2 tlha) due to credit
availability and to increased attention from the extension service of SOMALAC. Discussions are
ongoing with BTM on the feasibility of increasing the number of farmers organized in Credit
Associations by giving access to credit to farmers who do not own land. Farmers in Credit
Associations account for about 25% of rice production in the Lac Alaotra region.

6.5    In order to protect farmers' incomes, the project attempted to intensify and diversify
production in the Lac Alaotra basin. This action was unsuccessful. 3/ Research and extension
promoted the introduction of other irrigated crops and inter-seasonal crops (rainfed rice, wheat,
maize, beans, etc.), but farmers did not respond due to a preference among farmers for a rice variety
that was well suited to the area, but that did not allow for multiple crops and to competition from
other production activities in non-irrigated areas (cassava, groundnuts, livestock). 4/ No production
figures are available for the non-irrigated areas.
6.6    The land tenure situation on the large schemes is not clear. After rehabilitation, land holdings
were to be consolidated and farmers would receive a valid title. At credit closing, half of the farmers
still had no valid title and subdivision of land was increasing (in 1990, it was estimated that 21% of
the reallocated parcels had been subdivided again).
7.     Economic Results
7.1    The overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the project is estimated at 25% (Annex I) as
compared to 24% at appraisal. However, due to the unknown consequences of the political turmoil
in 1991 and the uncertainty surrounding SOMALAC, the rate of return may turn out to be optimistic.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that the rate of return remains above 10% even if net benefits decrease
by as much as 25%, as a result of increased maintenance costs or decreased yields. It was assumed
that irrigation works would continue to be maintained, either by the Government or the private sector,
which may be overly optimistic. If no solution is found to the institutional problems that arose after
the dissolution of SOMALAC, maintenance will suffer and production is likely to drop to pre-project
levels; this would mean a rate of return close to zero. Separate rates of return for the SOMALAC
(large) and CIRVA (small) irrigation schemes could not be calculated because the data collected
during implementation were not detailed enough. However, a comparison of investment costs and
yield increases between the large and smaller schemes suggests that the rate of return on smaller
schemes may well have been higher. During implementation, it turned out that rice selling prices
were higher than estimated during appraisal, but this was offset by higher production costs to farmers
(mainly fertilizers, pesticides and small mechanization).
8.     Proiect Sustainability
8.1    Although the project was largely successful in achieving its objectives, its sustainability is in
doubt (as was the case after the first project), largely because the institutional questions have still not
been resolved.
8.2    The main outstanding issue is that after dissolving SOMALAC, Government did not create
an institution capable of assuring maintenance of the main civil works (storage dams, main canals and
drains). The studies done on restructuring actually proposed one of two options to the Government:
to create an autonomous maintenance organization (preferred by the French co-financiers) or to
reinforce the existing CIRIR so as to enable it to take responsibility of maintenance (preferred by the

total output.
4/     Farmers owned land in both irrigated and non-irrigated areas.

Bank). No decision on either has yet been taken, which has potentially serious consequences for the
security of storage dams and for a rapidly diminishing capacity of the distribution and drainage
network (canals and drains need to be regularly cleaned because of on-going siltation due to erosion
in watersheds). Unless such an organization is established (or the existing CIRIR reinforced), it will
not be possible to sustain the results achieved. At present, the CCCE is reviewing the possibility of
a follow-up project that would focus on resolving the present institutional impasse. Extension
activities in the project area have been taken over by the Agricultural Extension Pilot Project (Cr.
2150-MAG).
9.    IDA Performance
9.1   IDA supervision fell short during the design of the civil works, which did not properly take
into account the existing erosion of the surrounding hills. Otherwise, the project was carefully and
continuously supervised by the three co-financiers in good coordination with each other (CCCE, FAC
and IDA). Supervision missions took place twice a year on average and received well prepared
documents from SOMALAC that served as the basis of discussions between cofinanciers and
Government. Because of the successful implementation of the physical components of the project,
IDA decided to cancel the planned mid-term review. When problems arose later on, Government,
IDA and CCCE met regularly in Paris.
9.2    SOMALAC suffered from a lack of timely counterpart funding, especially since 1987. In
1989, IDA was obliged to stop new procurement during a period of four months in order to press
Government to provide counterpart funding.
9.3    During implementation, there were differences of opinion among the cofinanciers and between
cofinanciers and Government on the timing of the liberalization of rice marketing and the
restructuring of SOMALAC, which slowed down the decision-making process.
10.   Borrower Performance
10.1   SOMALAC's management performed well in executing the project, but was unable to adjust
to a changing environment. It failed to manage the necessary reduction in staff over time. This was
true both for extension and for the marketing service where staff was kept even when SOMALAC's
purchases of paddy declined by 80% after the break-up of its monopoly.
10.2   Due to lack of Government clarity and decisiveness, the studies on the future of SOMALAC
took more time than needed and, as a result, demotivated SOMALAC personnel and diminished
farmers' confidence in Government's capacity to deal with their problems.  Some very good
counterparts, trained by expatriate technical assistance left SOMALAC when they realized that the
restructuring of SOMALAC was delayed amid interference by local and national politicians. This
is also one of the main reasons why it is difficult at this moment to assess the sustainability of the
project and of project impact on the development of the Lac Alaotra region.
II.   Consulting Services
11.1   The project used foreign technical assistance in different areas (extension, civil works,
research, general management, etc.) and at different levels.  In general, they performed well



8
throughout the project. However, due to a lack of long term planning on the part of SOMALAC
management, and the scarcity of local trainable counterparts, some foreign experts left without having
been able to train local staff.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1 The Staff Appraisal Report very often referred to policy orientation (liberalization, cost
recovery, general organization, extension approach, etc.) and was helpful to the Borrower and the
cofinanciers. For each supervision mission, SOMALAC management prepared in advance detailed
reports on the relevant aspects of the project, which helped considerably in supervision discussions
with SOMALAC and Government.

Comments: On large schemes, yields are a little lower than expected because land surfacing is not yet
completed. It is expected that, when surfacing is finished, yields will be higher than originally estimated. It is
also expected that the number of farmers in Credit Associations will increase as a result of changes in BTM's
requirements for providing credit to farmers (no longer necessary to be a land owner). The main reasons for
the Water Users' Associations to delay paying their dues for maintenance are: a) all land surfacing is not yet
terminated and farmers are reluctant to pay dues for unfinished works; and b) pressure from local politicians who
claim that water should be free; SOMALAC and the Ministry of Agriculture are now taking disciplinary actions
to force payments.

Note:  It was assumed that yields for the SOMALAC managed schemes would remain at
their 1991 levels throughout the period of analysis.
Yields for the small schemes, where land planning had not been completed at the
time of the PCR mission, are expected to continue to increase until 1995 and remain
at this level throughout the period of analysis.
A solution will have been found to the maintenance problem.
Cost data are from SOMALAC.
The rate of return remains over 10% when net benefits decrease by 25%. If no
solution has been found to the maintenance problem, net benefits will decrease to the
point that the rate of return will be 0%.
