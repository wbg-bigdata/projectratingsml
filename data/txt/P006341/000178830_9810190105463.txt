BRAZIL
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
PROJECT SUTMMARY
Borrower:        Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.C. (ELETROBRAS)
Guarantor:       Federative Republic of Brazil
Beneficiaries:  - Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais S.A. (CEMIG)
- Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL)
Amount:          US$222.8 million equivalent, including capitalized front-end
fee of US$555,611.
Terms:           Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
Relending
Terms:         ELETROBRAS will relend US$222.1 million of the proceeds of
the loan to CEMIG and COPEL on the same terms and conditions
as those of the loan. The beneficiaries would bear the
foreign exchange risk on the Bank loan.
Project
Description:  The proposed project consists of the 1984-87 rural
electrification investment programs of CEMIG and COPEL, and a
study of the problems of, and incentives for, rural
electrification. lt aims at raising agricultural production,
reducing the use of oil products in farming, improving the
quality of life on the land, and assisting the Federal
Government in formulating policies for the development and
financing of rural electrification. About 148,000 rural
properties and 49,000 village consumers would be connected by
CEMIG and COPEL. The project also includes training
components for both beneficiaries.
Risks:           The main risk faced derives from the financial difficulties
currently faced by the Brazilian power sector. The project
itself does not present any special risks.

1. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
The Energy Sector
- Energy Resources
1.01      Brazil's energy resources comprise a vast hydropotential, as well
as oil shale, coal, nuclear fuels and biomass. Proven oil and gas reserves
are limited. Of the indigenous energy resources only hydro and biomass
currently play a significant role in the country's energy supply mix, though
oil production has increased significantly in the last three years and
currently covers about 24% of market requirements. The potential for
hydroelectric development is estimated at about 213,000 MW, of which about
32,900 MW had been developed by the end of 1982 and about 10,000 MW of
additional hydro capacity are scheduled to be commissioned by 1987.
Presently the government is making important efforts to both increase oil
production and substitute alcohol, coal and other energy sources for oil.
The alcohol program, introduced in 1975, has already resulted in an average
alcohol content in automotive fuel of 19% (1980) and it is expected that by
1985 it will have risen to 39%. Coal now represents about 4% of the energy
supply and, by using it in coal-fired thermal power plants and in industry,
the government expects that by 1987 it will provide 6% of the total energy
supply. Brazil is also developing a nuclear generating capacity which should
have an important role in electricity generation beyond the year 2010, when
most of the economic exploitable hydro resources would already be utilized.
Efforts are also being conducted for a more intensive utilization of other
energy resources, including burning wood and sugarcane bagasse for
electricity generation in isolated areas.
- Energy Demand and Supply
1.02      The following table shows Brazil's primary energy balance and final
use of energy by sectors in 1981,and compares these to the 1976 figures. As
may be seen, even though oil production increased about 30% between 1976 and
1981, approximately one third of energy requirements are still met through
imports, thus reflecting the vulnerability of the economy to fluctuations in
foreign oil supplies and prices.   Nevertheless, oil participation in the
energy balance has decreased from 47% in 1976 to 40% in 1981, mainly due to
the increasing utilization of alcohol whose share in the country's energy
supply grew from 7% in 1976 to 10% in 1981.

- National Energy Policy
1.03      National energy policy has the following main objectives:
(a)  conservation and rational use of energy to encourage maximum
efficiency in the utilization of energy resources;
(b)  substitution of domestic for imported energy sources, especially
"renewables", wherever technically and economically feasible, to
reduce dependence on imported petroleum and coal;
(c)  exploitation of existing domestic energy resources and
intensification of search for new sources; and
(d)  promotion of electricity usage through extension of distribution
coverage in urban and rural areas.
The Power Sector
- Policies and Objectives
1.04      The power sector has a major role to play in achieving the national
energy policy objectives listed above. Pricing is of key importance in
conservation, and in this area progress has been made through marginal cost
tariff studies undertaken under loans 1300-BR and 1939-BR. Recent legisla-
tion permits the implementation of the results of these studies, which is
expected to take several years. In August 1982 differentiated tariffs for
peak and off-peak demands, and for wet and dry periods, were offered, on an
optional basis, to high-voltage consumers. On average, current tariffs would
have to be increased by 40%-50% to catch up with long run marginal costs.
This gap will be progressively narrowed with the implementation of the tariff
agreement reached between the Bank and the Government (paras. 1.18-1.19).
1.05      The energy policies in the power sector give emphasis to the use of
indigenous primary energy resources (hydro power, coal, and uranium; see
para. 1.13). The scope for further substitution for oil in power generation
is presently very limited in the main interconnected systems (in 1981 96% of
energy generated was hydro) but oil-fired plant is still required for some
isolated systems, specially in the North. Current expansion programs assume
that increase in demand up to the year 2000 will be met mainly by hydro
plants and that coal and nuclear plants will mainly provide the required
energy reserve for dry hydrological conditions. The substitution policy at
the domestic consumer level is based mainly on replacing the widely used
liquid petroleum gas (LPG) fueled appliances (mainly cookers and water
heaters) with electric appliances. This substitution is slow, due to the
consumer's reluctance to invest in new appliances, and expensive, given the
large investments required for expanding distribution networks.
1.06      Present government plans also provide for the gradual substitution
of electricity for petroleum products in the transportation sector (railways
and urban transport) and in industry ("Eletrotermia" program), taking
advantage of existing hydro capacity. Interruptible service at low rates is
currently being offered in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, to
induce industry to increase its use of electricity. Autoproducers with



oil-fired generating capacity are also being induced, through tariffs, to
increase their purchases of electricity generated from hydro sources.
- Organization
1.07      The institutional development of the Brazilian power sector over
the last 50 years has been characterized by progressive nationalization and
growing centralization, resulting in the consolidation of a few large and
hundreds of small utilities into a relatively compact structure of state and
federally-owned utilities. The power sector is under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), created in 1960. Since then the drive
has been towards increasing sector efficiency and coordination with the
establishment of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELETROBRAS) in 1962 and the
strengthening of the Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia Eletrica
(DNAEE) as regulatory agency. The aim has been to combine, as far as
possible, regionalization of operations with country-wide optimization.
1.08      Though complex and one of the largest in the world, the electric
power sector is well organized and past policies have generally been well
formulated and applied. Decree 60,824 of June 7, 1967 established the
current sector organization under which DNAEE performs regulatory functions,
grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions, sets tariffs
(after approval by the Ministry of Planning), and approves expansion plans.
ELETROBRAS serves as a utility holding company, administers public funds for
use by its subsidiaries and by state-owned utilities and coordinates external
borrowings. ELETROBRAS also analyzes expansion plans for major generating
and transmission facilities and coordinates and supervises the public power
system.
1.09      Government guidelines contained in the 1967 decree mentioned above
promote consolidation of public electricity services in the individual states
into single state-owned utilities. This has resulted in the absorption by
the major state-owned companies of many municipal and privately owned
utilities. Despite this process of consolidation, the sector still comprises
600 concessionaires, of which 25 are state companies and the rest small
municipal and private undertakings.
- Growth of Demand and Supply
1.10      During the 1977-1981 period electricity production by the public
supply system rose from 100,000 GWh to 140,000 GWh, at an average annual
growth rate of 8.7%. The 1981 national average production of electricity was
1,011 kWh per capita. The industrial sector uses 57% of the electricity and
the residential sector 20%. Due to the high industrial and urban
concentration in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the geographical
distribution of demand is uneven. Less than 60% of Brazilian households are
electrified but in the rural area about 19% of dwellings are electrified; the
rural electrification ratio goes from 40% in the state of Rio de Janeiro to
an insignificant 1% in Bahia.
1.11      Comprehensive projections of electricity requirements based on
detailed sectoral analysis, prepared by ELETROBRAS in 1982 showed that demand
was expected to grow 9.0% p.a. in 1983; about 11% p.a. in 1984-1988; and 7.3%
p.a. in the period 1988-1996. Revised demand forecasts, which take into



- 5 -
account the increases in electricity consumption observed through mid-1983,
show slower growth expectations (about 10% p.a. for 1984-88), and ongoing
revisions that should be completed in early 1984 may reasonably be expected
to further lower the above figures, at least for the next two years.
- System Expansion Planning
1.12      ELETROBRAS has the primary responsibility for the coordination of
planning in the power sector and for the preparation of system generation and
transmission expansion plans. Distribution planning is the responsibility of
each individual utility company. ELETROBRAS is subject to the supervision of
DNAEE in the preparation of its plans, and the plans themselves are subject
to the formal approval of the Ministry of Mines and Energy. However, in
practice, DNAEE tends to concentrate on tariff planning and on the sector
budgeting exercise, which provides financial projections for the ensuing
three years. In the last two years the responsibility for approving the
investment programs of public utilities has been exercised by the Secretaria
de Controle de Empresas Estatais (SEST/SEPLAN). Brazil's ongoing
construction program of generating plants and transmission lines is the
result of planning exercises carried out by ELETROBRAS on the basis of demand
forecasts which are now seen too optimistic and which assumed an availability
of financial resources to the sector which failed to materialize fully. This
program resulted in commitments for large generation plants (Itaipu, Tucurui)
and corresponding large transmission systems which are now nearing
completion, but which will leave a significant financial burden.
1.13      In 1982 ELETROBRAS prepared a generation and transmission
development plan to meet demand through the year 2000, in the so-called
"Plano 2000". Plano 2000 provides a firm construction program for the period
1983-1990, a tentative construction program for the period 1991-1995 and a
reference program beyond 1995. It is the result of a comprehensive planning
process which includes evaluation of energy resources, inter and intra
sectoral coordination, continuous methodological research and follow-up of
program implementation. It focuses on the problems originated by the size
and complexity of the Brazilian Power Sector in the context of the mDst
critical problem confronting the Energy Sector: its heavy dependence on oil
imports. Plano 2000 taps only indigenous resources - hydro, uranium and coal
- for expanding the generation system. The resulting generation expansion
plan for the period 1983-1990 recommends installing about 34,700 MW of
generating power, of which 89% would by hydro, 2% coal-fired thermal and 9%
nuclear. A comprehensive revision of the Master Plan study is scheduled for
1986, but partial revisions have already been required due to the lower
demand growth rate observed in 1982 and 1983 in relation to previous
expectations (para. 1.11). As a result of these revisions, construction
works have been slowed down when economically feasible in the major
generating plants under construction. Despite this, excess of installed
capacity is expected until 1986-88.
- Electricity Revenues
1.14      The regulation of electricity rates in Brazil is the responsibility
of the Ministry of Mines and Energy which exercises its authority through



- 6 -
DNAEE. The Water Code of 1934, as amended, established the principle of
service-at-cost plus an adequate return on capital. After 1971, power
companies were allowed to earn, at DNAEE's discretion, a rate of return
between 10 and 12% on remunerable investment.l/ To ensure that the ORTN
index, which is used to revalue assets, adequately reflects domestic
inflation, at negotiations it was agreed that, if for three consecutive
months the ORTN index for the 12-month period immediately preceding each
month is below the variation in domestic inflation for the same period by
more than 10 percentage points, loan disbursements could be suspended. Since
1981 DNAEE's responsibility regarding sector tariffs has been reduced by
effectively transferring the authority for tariff approval to the Secretaria
de Abastecimentos e Precos (SEAP/SEPLAN), which reviews these within a
broader policy context.
1.15      Consumer bills contain the following charges:
A.   The tariff, which on a nationwide basis, provides about
83% of revenues collected from consumers.
B.   The sole tax (IUEE) on residential, commercial and small
industrial2/ consumer bills, which provides about 9% of sector
revenues. Forty percent goes to federal sector agencies, fifty
percent to state and federal district uti:Lities, and ten percent to
municipal utilities; and
C.   The Compulsory Loan (8% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers using more than 2,000 kWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding 6%
annual interest and revalued through monetary adjustment).
1.16      A single tariff structure is applied to a:Ll interconnected systems,
and slightly higher tariffs are applied in isolated thermal systems. Until
1980, the Global Guarantee Fund (GGF), financed through a surcharge of up to
2% on assets in operation, was used in the tariff equalization process to
supplement the earnings of eligible utilities.  In recent years, the sector
as a whole has been obtaining rates of remuneration lower than the 10%
allowed by law (para. 1.18) and in January 1981 the Brazilian government
changed the role of GGF, from a tariff equalization instrument to a rate of
remuneration equalization instrument. Thus at present the annual guarantee
quota for each utility is based on the difference between its rate of
remuneration and the average remuneration of the secztor.
- Sector Finances
1.17      Over the last ten years, sector investments increased considerably
while sector revenues did not keep pace with the rate of growth of
investment. As a result, sector finances show a funding composition with
increasing reliance on borrowings. Since the major hydroelectric plants
1/   Remunerable investment is equal to net revalued assets plus an allowance
for inventory and net working capital, plus (or minus) the difference
between the prior years' actual and allowable return, less contributions
and grants.
2/   Industries using less than 2,000 kWh per month.



under construction and their transmission systems will begin to be
commissioned in the next two years (Itaipu in 1984 and Tucurui in 1985) and
because there will be an excess of installed capacity owing to a slowdown in
market growth (para. 1.11), the pace of investment will drop in the coming
years, providing the sector with some financial breathing space and allowing
for a reversal in past financial trends. Thus, by 1986 consumer-based
contributions are expected to reach about 43% and borrowings are expected to
be reduced to about 49% of total financial requirements, which is reasonable.
1.18      Under previous Bank loans, borrowers were required to maintain
their revenues, including transfers from the GGF, at levels consistent with
sound financial practice and in conformance with Brazilian legislation for
the sector (para. 1.14). However, in the 1978-1981 period most of the Bank's
borrowers or beneficiaries had a rate of remuneration which was below the 10%
allowed by Brazilian law. Because of concern over the deterioration of
sector finances, a special agreement was reached with the Brazilian
Government in September 1981 which provides the following:
(a) an annual rate of remuneration, for the electric power sector as a
whole, of 10% of the current net value of remunerable investments
(as defined by present Brazilian law), and the recovery of past
shortfalls in achieving such rate of remuneration since 1978,
should be attained as soon as possible;
(b) the Brazilian Government would carry out a program of increases in
the level of total charges per kWh to the final consumer; such
increases to be not less than 3% in real terms in 1982 and 5% in
each year thereafter, until such 10% rate of remuneration has been
achieved and shortfalls have been recovered;
(c) the above increases would be achieved through a series of quarterly
tariff adjustments;
(d) each of the Bank borrowers and beneficiaries would maintain every
year a rate of remuneration at least equal to that year's average
rate for the sector;
(e) the Government of Brazil would consult with the Bank and would
provide periodic reports on the execution of such program; and
(f) the Bank would not enforce the covenants in its loans relating to
rate of remuneration as long as the Brazilian government and its
agencies and power companies comply with the above provisions.
1.19      In 1982, the first and second quarterly tariff increases were
properly carried out, on the dates and in the percentages established in the
agreement. However, the third and fourth increases were delayed by two
months and by seven weeks, respectively. These delays resulted in about
US$280 million of foregone revenues for the sector, and the average tariff in
real terms was about 12% lower in 1982 than in 1981. The Brazilian
government made equity contributions to the power sector to compensate for
the foregone revenues caused by the delays in tariff increases. To address
these problems, the September 1981 agreement was amended in the following
manner:



(a) the Government undertakes to achieve the following annual rates of
remuneration for the sector as a whole: not less than 5% in 1984,
6% in 1985, 7% in 1986, 8% in 1987, 9% in 1988 and 10% in 1989 and
thereafter, and failure to achieve these targets would allow the
Bank to suspend disbursements on all outstanding loans to the power
sector;
(b) to achieve the agreed rates of remuneration, in 1984 and 1985
tariffs would each year be increased by 5% in real terms, through
quarterly tariff increases of which the February and May increases
would each provide half of the 5% real increase and the following
two increases would just adjust to inflation;
(c) in January 1986, the Bank and the Government would meet to
determine what tariff actions and other measures would be required
in 1986 and future years to achieve the agreed rates of
remuneration.
1.20      Financial projections for the sector show that the agreed tariff
increases for 1984 and 1985, complemented by cost reductions ensuing from the
Government's policy to keep wage increases and industrial price increases
below inflation levels (as measured by the INPC), will allow achieving the
agreed rates of remuneration, and will result in progressive recovery of
sector finances. However, a new factor affecting the operating costs of the
sector will be the cost of the energy purchased from the Itaipu binational
entity, which is expected to start commercial generation of electricity in
late 1984. ELETROBRAS has forecast, and the financial projections of both
CEMIG and COPEL reflect this assumption, that Itaipu's sales price will be
equal to the price for bulk sales charged by Furnas and Eletrosul
(US$14.5/MWh in 1984). This price would not suffice, however, to meet
Itaipu's financial requirements, even if successful renegotiation of its
debts allows deferring a substantial part of amortization needs. To address
this issue, at negotiations the Government agreed that if Itaipu tariffs are
increased above the forecasted levels, the Government will promptly take all
measures required to offset the ensuing cost increases and ensure that the
agreed rates of remuneration are achieved.
1.21      Historic and forecast financial statements for the power sector and
for ELETROBRAS are provided in the ELETROBRAS II Power Distribution Project
Staff Appraisal Report, which is being distributed separately.
- Bank Participation
1.22      Since 1949, the Bank has made 35 loans to the Brazilian power
sector, amounting to about US$1.9 billion. Most have been for hydroelectric
plants and associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and
Southern regions. Bank participation has also contributed to sector
organization and planning and has facilitated foreign commercial financing to
the sector. Eight project performance audit reports covering nine power
generation and five distribution projects3/ have been distributed to the
3/   Sec M 75-646 of September 4, 1975; Sec M 77-532 of June 28, 1977;
Sec M 789-34 of January 16, 1978; Sec M 79-82 of February 12, 1979;
Sec M 79-756 of October 23, 1979; Sec M 79-757 of October 23, 1979;
Sec M 79-905 of December 29, 1979; and Sec M 81-532 of June 22, 1981.

Executive Directors. These reports conclude that, despite construction
delays and cost overruns in some cases, the projects were substantially
successful. ELETROBRAS performance in on-going projects is satisfactory.
1.23      The most recent loans have been mainly for transmission and
distribution projects, as shown in the following table:
Loan No.     Date           Borrower         Project Purpose

1.24      The proposed loan would be the fifth Bank operation with
ELETROBRAS. ELETROBRAS will not play a direct role in the execution of the
physical components of the project, but it will be responsible for the
engagement and supervision of consultants to develop a medium-term rural
electrification (RE) plan (para 2.06), which is an important component of the
project.

2. RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
Rural Electrification in Brazil
2.01      Even though some of the Brazilian state utilities have carried out
rural electrification programs, R.E. has not been promoted at the national
level. In 1965 the Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria
(INCRA), a self-governing agency attached to the Ministry of Agriculture, was
made responsible for planning and promoting rural electrification. In 1971,
an executive agency for projets sponsored by INCRA, the Grupo Executivo de
Eletrificacao Rural (GEER, supervised by the Ministry of Agriculture) was
made responsible for assigning priorities to projects, appraising and
supervising them, and for arranging financing for the projects. GEER
on-lends funds from banks and government institutions, providing 80-90% of
the total cost of a project, the balance being supplied by the rural
cooperative members and/or the state utility. GEER has carried out two
programs financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB); the first
loan covered US$28.8 million of a US$50 million 1971-76 program during which,
through the construction of 26,000 kms of lines, connected 28,000 rural
consumers. A second IDB loan to GEER of US$55.7 million was made in 1977 for
the connection of a further 35,600 customers at a total cost of US$139.
million4/.
2.02      At present, progress in R.E. depends to a great extent on the
initiative taken by individual utilities, on the success of rural
cooperatives to expand and on the state governments' promotional interest.
Between 1976 and 1980 ELETROBRAS financed some R.E. projects submitted by
the utilities. In 1976 ELETROBRAS created the "Departamento de Eletrificacao
Rural" (DEER), to complement the activities of GEER. Through DEER,
ELETROBRAS coordinated the financing (50-60% of the cost) of individual R.E.
projects submitted by the state utilities. These projects consisted of
extension of distribution networks in rural areas close to existing lines.
The number of customers connected annually through E]LETROBRAS-financed R.E.
schemes rose from 17 thousand in 1976 to 43 thousand in 1978, falling to 34
thousand in 1979, reflecting a cutback in the availability of funds. Since
the last ELETROBRAS' funds for R.E. became exhausted in 1980, ELETROBRAS'
involvement decreased and its R.E. department (DEER) was absorbed by the
Engineering Department.
2.03      Cooperatives have participated in R.E., mainly through the
implementation of the two projects financed by IDB (para. 2.01). GEER admits
that the first project was not successful in reaching its objectives due to
the poor managerial and financial performance of cooperatives, but the second
project seems to have had fewer implementation problems. In general,
cooperatives are considered to be less efficient as they operate on small
scale and lack the expertise which the power companies have. In some states
(as in Minas Gerais) there is a trend for the power companies to purchase the
power facilities from the cooperatives.
4/   Projects in the country's most developed states as Minas Gerais, Sao
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul were not eligible
for financing under that loan.



- 11 -
2.04      At present the main problems facing the subsector are:
(a)   lack of well-developed standards for R.E. and of criteria for the
evaluation of R.E. projects, and poor coordination between the
programs carried out by the utilities to ensure that they are
consistent with national priorities; and
(b)   financial difficulties, which act as a constraint to extending RE
at an adequate pace.
The Government has indicated its willingness to address these
problems, and its wish to promote the use of electricity in the agricultural
sector, so as to increase productivity, reduce fuel consumption and improve
living conditions in rural areas. Given the financial constraints that R.E.
would face it has been agreed that promoting R.E. will require developing an
adequate institutional framework to assure that priorities are correctly
assessed and projects are implemented efficiently.
2.05      To achieve this objective at negotiations the Government agreed to
vest on ELETROBRAS the responsibility of reviewing the R.E. projects of all
utilities that request federal funding, or credit from federal banks or
agencies or from international financial institutions. To carry out this
function, at negotiations ELETROBRAS agreed to set-up a Rural Electrification
unit and undertook to review, coordinate and evaluate the R.E. programs
submitted to it to ensure their technical soundness, socio-economic
justification and financial viability. A condition of loan effectiveness
will be that the R.E. Unit is set-up, and its head is appointed.
2.06      At negotiations, it was also agreed that the proposed project would
include consultant services to prepare a study which is expected to provide
the basis for a national long-term R.E. development policy by assigning
priorities to the country's regions and balancing the unfilled demands of
R.E. with the resources available to the sector. The study would also
provide a methodology for the socio-economic evaluation of R.E. projects,
would review technical R.E. standards in use in Brazil and make
recommendations on this subject, and would advise on the institutional
changes that may be required to ensure work effectiveness. Agreement was
reached on the terms of reference for the consultants' work, and on the date
by which they would be engaged (June 30, 1984). It is expected that the
study will be completed in two years. The Government has agreed to exchange
views with the Bank on the consultant's recommendations prior to their
implementation.
Financing of Rural Electrification
2.07      At present rural consumers have to pay a substantial proportion
(between 70% and 100%) of the cost of connection (cost of constructing the
lines required to supply electricity to farms from the nearest existing
distribution line to the farm's door,in case of an individual farm, or the
pro rata cost of a network constructed to supply several farms, in the case
of a group of farms). In the past, they were sometimes able to partially
finance these investments through medium term bank loans with subsidized
interest rates (in 1982 45% per year without monetary correction, while



- 12 -
inflation ran close to 100%); however, there is no uniform policy in this
regard and currently interest rate subsidies are being eliminated. By and
large, each power company defines the proportion of the connection costs
which is borne by the rural consumer. As an offsetting measure, rural
tariffs are between 40% and 65% of urban tariffs (industrial rural consumers
are also exempt from the compulsory loan - para. 1.15). It is not clear what
the rationale is for: (i) requiring such significant financial commmitments
from consumers; (ii) subsidizing some, but not all, through low interest
loans; and (iii) selling electricity at a low price. Within ELETROBRAS we
found support for the conclusion that the policy is not conducive to the
objective of promoting rural electrification. The proposed project will
represent a departure from past practices, since consumers will be required
to finance a smaller share of project costs (about 50%, para. 5.10). It thus
represents an interim step until more satisfactory pricing/financing policies
are developed. In this regard, the study included in the project (para.
2.06) would look into the matters discussed above, and would provide a basis
for the future development of a R.E. financing policy. At negotiations it
was agreed that, until the R.E. study's recommendations become available, the
level of subsidies to rural consumers will not be increased.
Rural Electrification in Minas Gerais
2.08      The state of Minas Gerais has an area of nearly 600,000 km2 and
about 14 million inhabitants. The agricultural sector is the most important
in the state's economy and the main subsectors are coffee, dairy production,
cereals and cattle raising. There are 572,000 rural households in the state
and of these 450,000 are in the concession area of the state utility,
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (CEMIG). Of the total, about 50,000
presently have electricity supplied by CEMIG, and about 8,000 more by various
other smaller utilities and cooperatives. Thus, the potential for the
expansion of rural electrification is substantial. CEMIG aims to
progressively increase the rate of rural electrification through future
projects. CEMIG has recently also finalized agreements with most of the
electric power cooperatives in the state to purchase their electricity
sub-transmission and distribution facilities in exchange for CEMIG shares.
Rural Electrification in Parana
2.09      The state of Parana has an area of about 200,000 km2 and about 10
million inhabitants. Parana accounts for about one fourth of the total
agricultural output of Brazil; particularly significant are the production of
wheat, corn, soybeans, cotton, and coffee. Cattle, hog and poultry raising
are also very important, especially in the western part of the state where
about 40% of the connections under the proposed project are now planned.
At present there are about 450,000 rural households in Parana, of which about
75,000 have electricity. Of these, about 65,000 are served by the state
utility, Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL) and the others mainly by
cooperatives, of which fifteen operate within COPEL's concession area. COPEL
plans to continue developing its R.E. programs once the proposed project is
completed.

3. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
Introduction
3.01      The borrower for the proposed loan wuld be ELETROBRAS, which would
onlend the funds for the tw rural electrification subprojects to the
executing agencies: CEMIG and COPEL, under the same terms and conditions as
the Bank loan. At negotiations it was agreed that as a condition of loan
effectiveness, the subsidiary loan agreements between ELETROBRAS and CEMIG
and COPEL would have been signed. Both executing agencies have been Bank
borrowers in the past, they are both highly efficient and ELETROBRAS is not
expected to play a direct role in the execution of their respective project
components. Nevertheless, ELETROBRAS will be directly responsible for the
engagement of consultants for the R.E. study and for the implementation of
the agreements reached with the Bank on this matter (para. 2.06).
ELETROBRAS (The Borrower)
- Background.
3.02      ELETROBRAS was created in 1962 to consolidate existing public
utilities, centralize management of the sector and coordinate regional
expansion. ELETROBRAS is a mixed economy corporation, operating under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). The Government holds
99.6% of total company shares and 100% of voting (common) stock.  ELETROBRAS
achieved its current position in the power sector (para. 1.07) by gradually
absorbing existing federally owned utilities and acquiring several
foreign-owned power companies.
3.03      ELETROBRAS' regional subsidiaries (FURNAS, CHESF, ELETROSUL,
ELETRONORTE, LIGHT and ESCELSA) are responsible primarily for generation
activities and for high-voltage transmission systems covering several
states. They act as bulk suppliers to state and municipal utility companies
which generally have responsibility for sub-transmission and electricity
distribution. Since 1967, Government policy has been to consolidate local
companies and services at the state level under the state utility companies.
In line with this policy, existing distribution activities under ELETROBRAS
ownership are gradually being transferred to the state companies. ELETROBRAS
has equity participation in the utilities that wuld be the beneficiaries of
the proposed loan (16.7% in CEMIG and 13.3% in COPEL), as well as in most of
the state and municipal companies of the power sector.
- Organization and Management.
3.04      ELETROBRAS is governed by an Administrative Board of Directors
which sets policy, authorizes domestic and international borrowing and
decides on the annual budget. The Board of Directors consists of the
President (appointed by the President of the Republic of Brazil); five
Directors (elected at the General Shareholders meeting) who head the various
directorates of the company: Coordination, Operations and Systems, Finance,
Planning and Engineering, and Management Assistance; four Counselors who are
associated with public power companies under federal concession and have



- 14 -
experience in technology, finance and business management; and two
Counselors, one representing public bodies other than the Federal Government
and another representing private shareholders. (Annex 3.1 shows ELETROBRAS'
organization chart). An Executive Board, comprised of the President and the
five Directors, has responsibility for making policy recommendations to the
Board and managing the day-to-day activities of the company.
- Holding Company Role.
3.05      ELETROBRAS acts as a holding company for the sector, providing a
variety of services. Apart from being in charge of sector planning, it
provides financing, analyzes and coordinates the investment and expansion
plans of the power companies, plays an important role in budgeting for the
sector, provides technical and managerial assistance to sector companies,
coordinates regional and international activities and supports
standardization and research on electric technology and other energy
sources.
- Financing Role.
3.06      Because of its functions as holding company and financial agency
for the Brazilian powr sector, ELETROBRAS plays a key role in handling
sector finances. ELETROBRAS raises funds from four sources: statutory
resources, government funds, internally generated funds and borrowings.
(a)    Statutory Resources.  ELETROBRAS receives funds from three
statutory sources: the sole tax, the Compulsory Loan and the Global
Guarantee Fund (paras. 1.15-1.16).
(b)    Government Funds.  There are two sources of funding from the
Federal Government: its reinvestment of dividends and special
appropriations. Tn the past, government policy has been to
reinvest 95% of the dividends it received from ELETROBRAS. For
specific projects, ELETROBRAS also receives special appropriations
from the Federal Budget or from special legislation.
(c)    Internally Generated Funds.  ELETROBRAS' internal sources of funds
are dividends from its subsidiaries and associated companies and
interest and repayment of principal collected on loans to those
companies.
(d)    Borrowings.  ELETROBRAS raises both domestic and foreign currency
loans, under its own name in local and international markets, then
onlends the funds to its subsidiaries and associated companies.
- Planning and Budgeting.
3.07      ELETROBRAS has primary responsibility for the coordination of
medium and long-term planning in the power sector and preparation of system
expansion and investment plans. ELETROBRAS relies on the regional
subsidiaries for gathering data and performing planning studies in their
respective areas, and, under its coordination, state utility companies also
undertake independent planning exercises (paras. 1.12-1.13).



- 15 -
3.08      ELETROBRAS' resource allocation process gives highest priority to large
generating and transmission projects considered strategic by the Brazilian
government. For subtransmission and distribution planning ELETROBRAS relies on
its regional subsidiaries and state utilities. Until now, policies had not been
developed for the allocation of resources to R.E. This problem will be addressed
within the framework agreed with the Government and ELETROBRAS, whereby the latter
will hereafter evaluate the R.E. projects of the state utilities that request
federal assistance or credit from international financial institutions to ensure
that they are technically sound, economically justified and financially viable
(paras. 2.04-2.05).
- Staffing and Training.
3.09      ELETROBRAS' professional staff is competent and well trained and no
major difficulties have been encountered in recruiting and retaining qualified
personnel. Most of ELETROBRAS' top management and some of its professional staff
have had experience in utility operations in the Brazilian power sector and some
have had training in foreign utilities both in Europe and in North America.
ELETROBRAS has a comprehensive training program for the personnel of the power
utilities and for its own staff and has also provided training assistance to some
South American power companies.
- Accounting and Auditing
3.10      The accounting system of ELETROBRAS is satisfactory and well suited to
its needs. Internal control functions are vested in the Internal Auditing
Department which reports to the President. ELETROBRAS presently employs as
external auditors the firm Boucinhas, Campos & Claro S/C, which is acceptable to
the Bank. In addition, the Fiscal Council, appointed by the Shareholders'
meeting, carries out external control duties in accordance with Brazilian
legislation.
- Finances
3.11      ELETROBRAS, as a holding company and development bank for the sector,
handles the funds from statutory resources, government funds, internally generated
funds, and borrowings (para. 3.06). During the 1973-1982 period, about 60% of
ELETROBRAS' revenues originated from loan interest charges, and the remaining
revenues came mainly from shareholding profits. Decreasing consumer-based
contributions in face of a relatively heavy investment program, caused the
composition of ELETROBRAS' funds for the 1973-1982 period to show an increasing
reliance on borrowings (from 4% of total sources in 1973 to 25% in 1982). The
ELETROBRAS II SAR, which is being distributed separately, presents detailed
financial forecasts which show a reversal of the deteriorating trend discussed
above, and an increasing reliance on consumer-based contributions. Such
improvement is based on the implementation of the tariff agreements and
achievement of the agreed rate of remuneration targets (para. 1.19).



- 16 -
CEMIG (Beneficiary)
- Background.
3.12      Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (CEMIG) was created in 1952
through the merger of several small utilities, and is responsible for the
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in most of the state of
Minas Gerais. By the end of 1982 CEMIG's generating capacity was close to 3,900
MW. It then served over 1,900,000 consumers and sold about 17,400 GWh of
electricity per year.
- Organization and Management
3.13      CEMIG's organization is well structured (Annex 3.2 shows the
organization chart). General policy directives are set by a 10-person
Administrative Council elected for a 3-year term by the shareholders. The utility
is managed by a seven-member Board of Directors appointed by the Council and
consisting of the President and the directors of CEMIG's six departments
(Production and Transmission, Engineering and Construction, Distribution, Legal,
Administration, and Finances). The organization of the company also includes an
independent 3-member Fiscal Council, elected by the General Assembly, to review
the corporation's accounts.
3.14      CEMIG's management is based on clear assignment of responsibilities.
A consistent personnel development policy has brought to managerial positions a
group of well trained professionals. In the technical field, preparation and
investigation have placed the company in a leading position within the Brazilian
electric utilities through its participation in the various national-level
committees headed by ELETROBRAS (Distribution, Market Studies, System
Operations). In particular, in the R.E. field, it has been agreed that CEMIG will
share its experience through advising other less-prepared utilities in the design
and implementation of R.E. programs.
- Staff and Training
3.15      By December 1982 CEMIG's personnel numbered 12,500.  This results in a
ratio of 152 customers per employee, which is good considering the characteristics
of its service area. During the period 1977-1982 staff increased at a rate of 7%
p.a., while the number of customers grew 12% p.a.
3.16      The Human Resources Department, under the Administration Director, is in
charge of carrying out CEMIG's training programs. CEMIG maintains a training
center considered one of the best in Latin America. It provides training in the
operation and maintenance of electrical systems to medium-level staff from other
Brazilian electricity companies. Overall, during 1982 one out of five CEMIG's
employees attended a training course. Nevertheless, as during recent years
foreign-currency restrictions have obstructed training outside Brazil, which is
needed to maintain technological updating, a training component has been included
in the project which would, inter alia, finance the foreign exchange costs of
technical studies and trips abroad, a fellowship program and teaching materials
(para. 5.06). At negotiations, CEMIG agreed to annually furnish to the Bank its
training program, and provide such justifications as may be reasonably required to
ensure that the Bank-financed component has been soundly determined.



- 17 -
- Information, Systems Accounting, and Billing
3.17      CEMIG has up-to-date financial systems for planning and budgeting
purposes. Annual budgets are prepared by the Financial Planning Department which
puts together and updates periodically all budgets and financial forecasts.
CEMIG's accounting system is satisfactory and well suited to the utility's needs.
CEMIG's billings are carried out by its data processing system, and collections by
the banking system. In case of non-payment, the service is suspended between 15
and 30 days after due date; the suspension is triggered by a control system which
signals the date at which suspension of service becomes economical; actual
enforcement is good.
- Audits
3.18      CEMIG employs as its external auditors the international accounting firm
Arthur Andersen S/C, which is acceptable to the Bank. In addition, the Fiscal
Council, appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting, carries out external control
duties in accordance with Brazilian legislation. Internal control functions are
vested in the Internal Audit Department which reports to the Financial Director.
Internal Audit carries out an adequate program of financial and operational audits
and follows-up on past recommendations. At negotiations, CEMIG agreed to continue
to appoint independent external auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and to furnish
to the Bank its audited financial statements within four months of the close of
its fiscal year.
- Performance under Previous Loans
3.19      CEMIG has been the borrower in four Bank loans and a beneficiary of
another loan for a total of US$272.9 million equivalent. Project Performance Audit
Reports have been distributed to the Executive Directors on the first four
loans5/, they indicate that CEMIG's performance was generally satisfactory. The
fourth loan (the 1,000 MW Sao Simao hydroelectric project, financed under loan
829-BR of June 14, 1972) was satisfactorily completed and Sao Simao started
operation three months before the date estimated at the time of appraisal but with
a 70% cost overrun due mainly to major increases in the cost of civil works and
changes in the number and capacity of installed generating units in relation to
initial design. The fifth project (Loan 1538-BR, Part A, of March 3, 1978) for
subtransmission and distribution expansion is still underway. Execution of this
project was considerably delayed due to financial difficulties (paras.
6.01-6.02). The pace of project execution as well as CEMIG's financial
performance have improved since 1981 (paras. 6.03-6.04), and no major problems are
foreseen for project completion.
COPEL (Beneficiary)
- Background.
3.20      COPEL was established by State Decree 14-947 of 1954 and is responsible

and distribution of electricity in Parana. COPEL has grown very rapidly since its
creation and has acquired most of the other power utilities in Parana; it
currently supplies about 85% of the electricity service in the State. At year end
1982, COPEL had an installed generating capacity of 1,660 MW, served close to
1,200,000 consumers and sold about 5,800 GWh of electricity per year.
- Organization and Management.
3.21      In general terms, COPEL's organization is very similar to CEMIG's (Annex
3.3 shows the organization chart). General policy directives are set by a
7-person Administration Council elected for a 3-year term by the General Assembly
of shareholders. Current members of the Administrative Council include three
representatives from the Parana state government -- the State Secretaries for
Finance, for Planning and for Commerce and Industry - one from private industry in
Parana; one from ELETROBRAS, and two officers of COPEL (its president and its
financial director). The diversity of the composition of the Council brings the
necessary depth and broad perspective to decision-making in the Council while the
presence of the two key COPEL officials provides an important link between policy
formulation and implementation within the company. Similarly to CEMIG, the
utility is managed by a six-member Board of Directors (appointed by the
Administrative Council) consisting of the President and the directors of COPEL's
six departments. The organization of the company also includes an independent
3-member Fiscal Council, elected by the General Assembly.
3.22      COPEL is organized along functional lines: there are five departments
each headed by a director. The departments are: Administration and Finance,
Distribution, Planning, Operations and Engineering and Construction. Each
department has two or more subdivisions headed by a superintendent. COPEL's
regional operations covering Curitiba, Ponta Grossa, Londrina, Maringa and
Cascavel come under the Distribution department. This organizational structure
permits an efficient management. Furthermore, COPEL's policy of systematically
identifying, training and promoting staff from within has enabled the company to
build up a core of competent upper and middle management.
- Staff and Training.
3.23      At year end 1982, COPEL's permanent staff numbered 8,500; about 50% were
professionals. Through a program of carefully recruiting, placing and training
its work force, COPEL has been able to build up an efficient, well motivated and
competent work force. COPEL's policy of identifying the potential of its staff
through appropriate evaluations and training them accordingly for higher positions
has resulted in a rather stable work force. Despite absorption of several smaller
and less efficient utilities in recent years, COPEL has been able to achieve
steady increases in its customer to employee ratio which was 118 in 1975 and 138
in 1982. COPEL has a well designed training program covering its supervisory,
technical and financial personnel. In 1982, about half of the permanent staff
participated in in-house or external training programs. Nevertheless, as
financing of training programs outside the country is becoming difficult due to
foreign exchange restrictions, a training component is proposed in the project
which would finance fellowships and teaching materials for technical staff.
Similarly to CEMIG (para. 3.16), at negotiations agreement was reached that COPEL
will annually furnish to the Bank its training program, and provide such



- 19 -
justifications as may be reasonably required to ensure that the Bank-financed
component has been soundly determined.
- Information Systems, Accounting, and Billing.
3.24      COPEL's financial planning and budgeting systems are good.  Its
financial forecasts have been computerized and tie-in with its technical and
market forecasts. COPEL prepares 10-year financial plans and an annual budget
covering projected expenditures for capital investment and operations. These are
supplemented by several auxiliary budgets including borrowing needs, projected
debt service and cash flow. Through a computer model, which allows projections of
its daily cash needs, COPEL is able to keep its cash balances to a minimum and to
program its borrowings to minimize carrying costs.
3.25      COPEL's internal reporting and management information system is also
good. It has established a modular linked computerized system covering its
customer accounting, payroll and personnel administration, accounting, property
control, financial control, inventory management and transport management.
Operating and financial reports are prepared accurately and promptly.
3.26      COPEL's billing is part of its computerized information processing
system. Bills are rendered monthly, are due 15 days after receipt and are
collected through commercial banks. Customer service is a special concern and a
number of offices - including a telephone center - have been opened in Curitiba to
provide prompt and efficient service to clients - and potential clients - in
inquiries about connection fees and conditions and billing problems. Customer
services offices will be extended to other regions, and offices in Curitiba will
be provided with computer terminals to expedite answer to inquiries.
- Audits
3.27      COPEL has a well staffed internal audit division under the Financial
Director. The division carries out a program of continuous audit and internal
controls on all aspects of the company's operations. The internal audit program
is satisfactory. The independent Fiscal Council (para. 3.21) reviews all
financial transactions of the company. Until 1982 COPEL's financial statements
have been audited by Justus Auditores but COPEL, with the concurrence of the Bank,
has now engaged Boucinhas, Campos, & Claro S/C, to carry out the 1983 audit. At
negotiations COPEL agreed to continue to appoint independent external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank and to send to the Bank audited financial statements
within four months of the end of its fiscal year.
- Performance under Previous Loans
3.28      COPEL has received two previous loans from the Bank for a total of
US$161 million. (Loans 1257-BR and 1721-BR). COPEL's performance under Loans
1257-BR and 1721-BR respectively which financed its 1976-1979 and 1980-1983
Distribution Expansion Program has been satisfactory. Engineering designs,
preparation of equipment specifications, and supervision of project works have
been satisfactorily carried out by COPEL's staff. Project execution for Loan
1721-BR, has been smooth, but completion may be delayed by 18 months, due
principally to the lower than expected demand growth which has delayed the need
for some system expansions included in the project.

Performance Indicators
3.29      At negotiations agreement was reached with CEMIG and COPEL on the
performance indicators respectively shown in Annexes 3.4 and 3.5. These
indicators will be followed-up during project supervision, and both utilities will
also be expected to report periodically on their evolution and account for
significant deviations between actual figures and these estimates.

4. THE MARKET AND THE MEANS TO MEET IT
CEMIG
Historical Data
4.01      Between 1970 and 1980 CEMIG's sales of electricity increased at
consistently high rates, which on average exceeded 13% per year. The main reason
for this growth was a very large industrial consumption, which rose about 350% in
the period. Additionally, the number of consumers connected practically
quadrupled.
4.02      In 1981 demand slackened considerably as Minas Gerais' gross internal
product fell by about 1.1% (while Brazil's GDP is estimated to have fallen 1.9%).
Though electricity sales as a whole rose by 2.5% during the year it is worth
noting that sales to the industrial sector, which presently accounts for about
three-fourths of CEMIG's market, were practically stagnant. In 1982 sales again
only showed a small growth (3%), as the economy did not experience any significant
recovery.
4.03      Since 1976 sales to the rural sector have been growing significantly,
however they presently still acount for less than 1.5% of total company sales.
Thus, the low level of rural tariffs, discussed in para. 2.07, is seen to have no
significant impact on the company's finances.
Market Forecast
4.04      In order to unify the market forecasting criteria employed by all
electric utilities, in 1976 DNAEE issued methodological guidelines which are in
line with the present state-of-the-art. They were reviewed by the Bank and found
reasonable. Both CEMIG's and COPEL's forecasts (para. 4.10) are based on these
guidelines.
4.05      CEMIG's market forecasts are shown in Annex 4.1.  They are based on
detailed projections for each consumers class, which in the case of the large
industrial loads supplied at high voltage are supported by market surveys of the
expected demand and expansion plans of all major customers. For other sectors,
the forecasts are based on statistically significant relationships observed in the
past. The slow increase in industrial sales in the period 1984-1988 (estimated
industrial sales by 1988 would be still below sales in 1983) reflects a
conservative assessment of the country's economic recovery prospects.
Development Program
4,06      The generation and transmission expansion programs for the
interconnected system were studied by ELETROBRAS in the Plano 2000 (para. 1.13).
Within Plano 2000, CEMIG is to execute two hydro plants (Nova Ponte, 504 MW and
Miranda, 422 MW), several transmission lines in 345 and 500 kV (mainly
reinforcement of the transmission systems for Sao Simao and Emborcacao
hydroplants), expansion or construction of several substations and the connection
of about 750,000 new consumers in the period 1984-1988. In addition to its own



- 22 -
generation, CEMIG will be purchasing energy from FURNAS and Itaipu during the next
ten years. Annex 4.2 presents the forecast energy balance for CEMIG's system
through 1988. As may be seen, the existing hydro plants, the purchase agreements
with FURNAS and Itaipu, and the full scale operation of the Emborcacao hydro
project will provide a surplus energy margin through the forecasting period. The
corresponding spilled water is due to the overall existing excess of capacity in
the system which had been designed based on higher demand forecasts. CEMIG's
1984-88 expansion program amounts to about US$1,300 million. Annex 6.5 provides
information on the main program components.
COPEL
4.07      In the period 1970-1980 COPEL's electricity sales had a growth record
even more impressive than CEMIG's (para. 4.01). The average annual growth rate
was about 20%, as the company progressively absorbed small utilities operating in
the state and expanded its generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.
For the state of Parana as a whole, the average growth rate was over 17% per year,
well above national averages.
4.08      As in the case of CEMIG, the industrial sector accounts for the largest
proportion of sales growth (60% of the increase in total sales between 1970 and
1980 was originated in the sector), however the contribution of the residential,
commercial and other consumer classes wvas also significant, reflecting the better
than average economic growth performance of the state of Parana.
4.09      The present recession did not affect Parana in the same degree as other
states. Thus, despite a somewhat slackened pace of sales growth to industrial
consumers (7.8% in 1981 and 4.3% for 1982), total electricity sales continued
rising at fairly high rates: 8% in 1981 and 10.1% in 1982.
Market Forecast
4.10      The methodological criteria employed by COPEL to develop their sales
forecasts, are based on DNAEE's guidelines (para. 4.04), and are substantively
similar to CEMIG's. Basically, specific forecasts were made for each large
industrial consumer in the state on the basis of contractual agreements and of
forecasts prepared by the consumers themselves, and econometric methods were
employed for the remaining categories. The forecast results, which are summarized
in Annex 4.3, show a reduction in demand growth for 1984 followed by a moderate
recovery in the period 1985-1988.
Development Program
4.11      COPEL will carry out part of the generating and transmission expansion
program defined by Plano 2000 for the S-SE interconnected system.  The main
generation facility included in the program is the Segredo hydro plant (1,260 MW)
which would start operations in 1990. Other works included in the program are 230
and 138 kV transmission lines and substations and connection of about 580,000 new
consumers in the period 1984-1988. Annex 4.4 shows the energy balance for COPEL's
system through 1988. As in the case of CEMIG (para. 4.06), the existing hydro
plants and the contracted purchases from Itaipu will provide energy that exceeds
the requirements to meet demand in the period 1984-1988. This reflects the
general excess of installed capacity due to the slower than expected growth of
demand. The 1984-88 expansion program amounts to nearly US$1,000 million. Annex
6.11 provides COPEL's investment program.

5. THE PROJECT
Description
5.01      The proposed project, which is expected to lead to the increase of
agricultural production through irrigation, foster the development of
agroindustries, allow oil substitution and improve living conditions in rural
areas, would consist of:
(i)  A study (ELETROBRAS R.E. Study), to be carried out by a consultant to be
engaged by ELETROBRAS, that will propose institutional arrangements,
policy criteria, financing schemes and technical guidelines for R.E.;
(ii)  Two R.E. subprojects (CEMIG R.E. subproject and COPEL R.E. subproject),
each of which consists of the farm and village R.E. portion of the
1984-1987 expansion program of the corresponding beneficiary; and
(iii)  Two training programs (CEMIG Training Program and COPEL Training
Program).
5.02      The ELETROBRAS' R.E. study (para. 2.06) is expected to provide to the
Government a firm basis to address the issues currently faced by the R.E.
subsector. The terms of reference for the study, which are available in the
project file, were agreed with ELETROBRAS during negotiations, at which time the
date of June 30, 1984 was set for the engagement of the consultants.
5.03      The CEMIG and COPEL R.E. sub-projects provide for the construction of
three-phase and two-phase 34.5 and 13.8 kV rural distribution lines and
transformers (rural distribution lines), 13.8 kV three phase and single-phase
rural consumer connection lines and transformers for farm electrification (rural
circuits), 34.5 and 13.8 kV distribution lines for village electrification,
(primary feeders), low voltage distribution lines (secondary feeders), consumer
connections, metering equipment and related auxiliary equipment required for the
appropriate expansion of the capacity of the respective beneficiary's systems.
More than 70% of the ultimate beneficiaries of the project would be medium-size
farmers dedicated to productive activities mainly oriented to export. The
remaining ultimate beneficiaries would be agricultural workers living in farms and
small villages (including about 7,000 low-income consumers).
5.04      CEMIG's R.E. subproject (Minas-Rural) would result in connecting 60,000
rural consumers in a four-year period thus more than doubling the number of rural
properties currently electrified in the state of Minas Gerais. It builds upon the
10,000 kms of distribution lines which are being constructed under the Minas-Luz
Project (financed by IDB; it will connect about 330,000 households in small towns
with an investment of about US$390 million), which would be extended to the farms
to be electrified. The total population benefitted by this sub-project is
estimated at about 516,000.
5.05      COPEL's R.E subproject would: (i) more than double the number of
electrified rural projects in the state through the supply of electric energy to
88,400 rural properties; (ii) extend service to 49,000 new consumers living in
localities already electrified, and in new rural localities currently without



- 24 -
service; and (iii) connect about 6,800 low income6/ consumers. The total
population benefited by this sub-project is estimated at about 894,000.
5.06      The proposed training programs were developed by the utilities.
At negotiations both utilities agreed to furnish their annual training programs
for review by the Bank before January 1 of eachyear. The programs will provide
consulting services and enable training abroad, which is now restricted due to
foreign exchange constraints. In the case of CEMIG, the training program also
provides funds for technological research on RE standards (para. 5.18) and for the
installation of model farms (para. 5.25). CEMIG has agreed to share the results
of these programs with COPEL and with ELETROBRAS. Regarding training abroad it is
considered that the Bank's support is important to ensure that the high staffing
standards of the tw utilities do not deteriorate, and to enable them to keep
abreast of state-of-the-art developments. About 50% of the training funds would
be for rural electrification, and the balance for general training needs.
Definition of Sub-Project Size
5.07      As resources for R.E. are scarce in relation to demand, the size of both
R.E. subprojects was defined by the concerned utilities with due regard to the
expected benefits to be obtained through the program and to the executing and
financing capability of each utility. The main factors considered in defining the
two subprojects were:
(i) The surveyed demand for electrification in the rural areas and its
relation to the rural population enjoying electricity service;
(ii)  The average costs of rural connections;
(iii) The size and timing of the expected benefits;
(iv)  Financing constraints (from the utilities' point of view) and amount of
contributions required from the rural consumers7/;
(v) The executing and monitoring capability of each power utility.
6/ This class of consumer is currently defined as those candidates for
connection within the single-phase residential consumption category with
family income of up to two months minimum wages, whose dwellings are less
than 50 sq meters in area and located near the distribution lines of the
utility.
7/ In Minas Gerais, for example, CEMIG estimates that the potential market
for new connections ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 per year, depending on
whether the individual proprietor will be required to contribute 70% or
50% of the connection charges. These figures compare with actual connec-
tions of 6000 in 1981, when the proprietors had to pay 100% of the cost.
At present CEMIG has about 20,000 unfilled requests for connection and
additional requests are expected once the Bank financed project is
announced to the public.



- 25 -
Selection of Project Areas
5.08      An important aspect addressed during project preparation was the
methodology to be applied to define area priorities. The only existing work on
the matter in Brazil is the 1981 code prepared by the Distribution
Coordination Committee (CODI)8/ as a result of undertakings under Loan
1300-BR calling for nation-wi7de rationalization of distribution extensions.
The code makes use of a large number of economic and social parameters, many
of them not available with the required detail. Thus,it has been agreed that
the preparation of a methodology for selecting area priorities will be
included within the ELETROBRAS R.E. Study (para. 5.02). For the proposed
project a practical approach was used, which attempts to maximize the
socio-economic impact. The method makes use of a small number of socio and
economic parameters which serve to determine a ranking coefficient for every
county ("municipio"). The main parameters are: rural population, number of
rural properties, income from farming and livestock activities, availability
of electric infrastructure, and number of properties already electrified.
The county was selected as the minimum territorial unit due to data
availability. The results of the process provide a merit order of counties
deserving electrification for inclusion in the proposed project. The number
of farms to be electrified in each county was estimated from the county
ranking coefficient and the total size of the project. (A detailed
evaluation of CODI's methodology and of the criteria applied for selecting
the areas to be electrified may be found in the project file).
Cost and Financing
5.09      The total estimated project cost (including physical and price
contingencies, but before financial charges) amounts to US$582.2 million, of which
US$243.3 million (42%) is the estimated direct plus indirect foreign exchange
component.9/ Sub-projects costs are based on estimates prepared by CEMIG and
COPEL on the basis of actual recent prices for material, equipment and
construction wrks in on-going RE programs, and were reviewed by the Bank. Base
costs reflect prices as of June 1983 and include engineering, supervision, and
administration costs. Local costs include taxes on local goods and contracts and
taxes and duties on imported goods, the total of which is about 10% of local
costs. The estimated cost of the training program includes consulting services
(US$7,300 per staff-month, including subsistence and travel expenses), tuition and
travel expenses for fellowships and, in the case of CEMIG, equipment for the
technological research program and for installing the model farms (para. 5.25).
8/  CODI, headed by ELETROBRAS, groups the country's largest utilities, and
is responsible for the preparation of a national standard code for
distribution.
9/   For purposes of determining the loan amount the estimated cost of
reserved procurement, US$58.3 million (para. 5.20), was excluded from
total project costs, and the indirect foreign exchange costs attributed
to such procurement (US$20.5 million) are not financed by the Bank loan.



- 26 -
The cost estimate for the R.E. study is also based on an average consultant cost
of $7,300 per staff-month. Physical contingencies wre calculated at a rate of
10%, which is considered adequate. Price contingencies were applied to base costs
plus physical contingencies, and were estimated over the 6-year execution period
of the project using the following annual escalation rates: 8.0% for 1983, 7.5%
for 1984, 7.0% for 1985, and 6% for 1986 and thereafter. Price contingencies on
local costs, which are expressed in dollar terms equivalent, were estimated
assuming that the exchange rate is to be devalued pari passu with domestic
inflation through 1984 and according to the differential between domestic and
international inflation thereafter. Project costs are detailed in Annex 5.1 and
are summarized in the following table:

5.11      About 50% of the cost of connections is expected to be financed by
the rural consumers however, since the project also includes other
miscellaneous components the participation of consumers in the financing
scheme is about 39%. At present both CEMIG and COPEL are requiring consumers
to pay, in average, 70%-85% of the cost of connections and are able to
connect 5,000-10,000 consumers per year each. Data on unfilled connection
requests indicates that there is enough interest among rural consumers to
justify the proposed project size with the financing scheme that has been
described. The cost of connecting each farm will be defined after preparing
each extension project (for groups averaging 5-20 farms; the actual number
would depend on the network configuration and the number of farms requesting
to be connected). The costs used in the project reflect average costs based
on past experience. Once the cost of connection is defined, the potential
consumers, assisted by the utilities, would seek financing, if needed. Cases
in which not all the initially interested potential consumers confirm their
participation, through a down payment, will require reviewing the extension
project and consequently the pro rata cost for the remaining interested
farmers. The village-electrification portion of the project, would be fully
financed by the utilities, as is usual in urban distribution, charging to
consumers a connection fee when they apply for connection.
5.12      To further ensure consumer interest, at negotiations the Government
agreed to establish a rediscount facility at the Central Bank, which will
amount to US$160 million (of which US$30 million are to be provided in 1984,
US$40 million in 1985, US$40 million in 1986, US$40 million in 1987, and
US$10 million in 1988) to provide financing to rural consumers for purposes
of the project, and CEMIG and COPEL have also approached commercial banks to
provide consumers with additional medium or long-term credit and have
received expressions of interest which suggest that the banks will be willing
to provide such financing to consumers. COPEL and CEMIG have agreed to enter
into agreement with commercial Banks, as required to ensure timely project
completion.
5.13      Co-financing to the utilities for their share of project costs is
relatively small in relation to the total financial requirements (paras. 6.06
and 6.17). Thus, the financing plan presented in para. 5.10 shows total
financing requirements met in the following manner: consumer contributions
39%, CEMIG and COPEL 19%, IBRD loan 38% and cofinancing 4%.
5.14      The proposed loan in the amount of US$222.8 million, would finance
the following project components in the amounts shown in para. 5.19:
a)    the cost of the ELETROBRAS R.E. study;
b)    equipment and materials (conductors, transformers, insulators,
switching, protection and auxiliary equipment) for constructing the
rural networks up to a cost corresponding to the estimated direct
plus indirect foreign costs of the CEMIG and COPEL R.E.
sub-projects;



- 29 -
c)    the foreign cost component of teaching materials, and fellowships
for the CEMIG and COPEL training programs and the cost of technical
assistance for training purposes;
d)    the physical and price contingencies on the components of the
project financed under the Bank loan;
e)    the front-end fee on the Bank loan;
Implementation
5.15      Annex 5.2 presents the expected project implementation schedule.
The RE study entrusted to ELETROBRAS would be carried out by a qualified
consulting firm, to be engaged not later than June 30, 1984 under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank. The study would be supervised by
ELETROBRAS through the R.E. Unit it has undertaken to set-up (para. 2.05) and
the staff assigned to this unit will act as counterpart to the consultants.
5.16      The RE works will be implemented by CEMIG and COPEL's own staff who
will perform engineering and supervision. Both CEMIG's and COPEL's technical
staff have demonstrated high standards of professionalism in the execution of
previous projects. Larger works would be built under local contracts, and
smaller works would be carried out by the utilities' own staff, as is normal
utility practice. The executing capability of the corresponding utilities
was taken into account when defining the construction programs.
5.17      The training programs would be carried out by the CEMIG's and
COPEL's own training units, which have prepared operating plans for the
period 1984-87. These plans were reviewed by the Bank and found
satisfactory. The technological research program as well as the
establishment of model farms will be executed by CEMIG's staff with the
support of consultants as required.
Technical Standards
5.18      Technical standards for distribution works in Brazil are developed
by the Distribution Coordinating Committee (CODI). Standards are broad
enough to permit adapting them to local conditions in the concession area of
any utility. The distribution systems in the farming areas in the states of
Minas Gerais and Parana have been developed with due regard to minimizing
cost, within reasonable reliability standards. They consist mainly of
three-phase 34.5 and 13.8 kV primary circuits and single-phase 13.8 kV
secondary circuits. Low voltage is mainly supplied to consumers in
single-phase circuits through single-phase distribution transformers. Two
phase line configurations are also fairly common when required for load
levels. Irrigation pumps and other motors are usually fed through
three-phase lines. Steel or wood poles are used when the total cost of
poles, including maintenance and replacement is lower than the cost of
concrete poles. The project would provide financing to CEMIG for
technological research to define under which conditions each of these kinds
of poles is the most economic. Substantial data in this regard is already
available. The low-income consumers program includes the "simplified
connection pole", an inexpensive arrangement designed by CODI which permits
centralizing all connector elements in a single pole-connection. As
electrification is being extended to the less densely populated and



- 30 -
lower-income rural areas, the Bank has encouraged the preparation of studies
on possible means of keeping down the cost of service, while continuing to
assure a reasonably reliable service to the consumers. These studies have
been carried out by ELETROBRAS (under Loan 1300-BR), with the cooperation of
its subsidiaries through CODI, and the resulting recommendations are
currently being tested (but not yet extensively used) by some of the
utilities. These simplified standards are steel wire lines (which permit
substantial investment savings in poles) and one-wire earth-return
single-phase lines (either in aluminum or in steel) which save in conductor
cost. The training programs included in the project would include visits
abroad to review foreign experiences with alternative methods. This,
together with experience from the tests in progress, should lead to
progressive improvements in the choice of technical standards.

*   : Reserved Procurement
Note:  Figures in parenthesis are the respective amount financed by the Bank
loan.



- 31 -
Equipment and materials which are likely to attract international
bidders would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB),
except for special equipment (not exceeding US$2.0 million) for teaching
purposes and for the demonstration farms which would be acquired through
limited international tendering.  Brazilian suppliers of items included in
the sub-projects are reasonably competitive; as in previous power loans,
Brazilian suppliers whose bids contain components manufactured in Brazil
equal to at least 50% of the value of the bid would be given a margin of
preference of 15% or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower.
According to past experience about 60% of the value of the contracts placed
through such bidding may be awarded to Brazilian suppliers. Contracts in
which the cost of freight is a high proportion of cost or that consist of a
large amount of miscellaneous materials whose individual value is low, would
be procured under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank as in such cases this is considered to be the mDst
economic and efficient method. Reserved procurement of materials with a
total cost of US$58.3 million (of which US$26.4 million correspond to the
CEMIG subproject and US$31.9 million to the COPEL subproject), is not
expected to have adverse effect on project costs or project execution, as the
number of Brazilian suppliers is high and their prices are generally
competitive. The cost of such reserved procurement was excluded from total
projects costs when the Bank loan amount was determined.
5.20      Contracts for constructing lines in the rural areas, which involve
many small works over a geographically wide area and over a long period of
time, would be procured locally.  Such procedure is considered the most
economic and efficient. Consultant services for the R.E. study and for the
training programs would be contracted in accordance with Bank guidelines for
selecting consultants.  Financing of fellowships programs under the training
components would be made through reimbursement of foreign currency expenses.
Engineering services for design and supervision of the projects would be
provided by the beneficiaries' own staff, which is capable of doing so.
Technical and administrative services required for the procurement of goods
would be performed by the beneficiaries' own personnel which has acquired
satisfactory experience in the matter during the execution of previous
projects.
Disbursements
5.21      As CEMIG and COPEL are executing Bank-financed projects in which
distribution works are included, documents acceptable to the Bank for the
procurement of most of the distribution equipment and materials to be
purchased under the project are already available, so that bid invitations
may be issued without delay once the loan has been negotiated, for award
after Board approval. Both utilities expect that disbursements will build-up
quickly starting in 1984 and would be completed six months after nominal
project completion, i.e. five years after Loan approval. In view of the
Bank's experience it would be prudent to allow for one additional year of



- 32 -
disbursements, i.e. for a total of six years after loan approval. Compared
with the historic disbursement profile for distribution projects, six years
would achieve only 87% disbursement; however, since this is an average
figure, in view of the advanced state of preparation and the previous
experience of CEMIG and COPEL with Bank procurement procedures, 100% loan
disbursement in six years is considered a reasonable target. The
disbursement schedule, shown in Annex 5.3, was prepared based on Bank-wide
disbursement profile patterns for distribution and transmission loans.
5.22      Disbursements would be fully documented, and would be made for:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods, or 100% of the
ex-factory cost for local goods, for the R.E. subprojects;
(b) 100% of expenditures on consultant services (R.E. Study and
Training Programs); and
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods and fellowships of
the training programs.
In order to reduce the interval during which the Beneficiaries would finance
locally-procured items which are to be financed by the Bank loan with their
own resources, a Special Account for US$20 million would be opened with the
Central Bank for payment to Brazilian suppliers. Withdrawals of the account
would be made at the exchange rate that prevailed on the date of the
expenditures. The Central Bank would send the corresponding Statements of
Expenditures to the Bank, which would subsequently replenish the Account.
The closing date would be June 30, 1990.
Risks
5.23      There are no special risks involved in the project; the works will
follow normal practices and procedures that have been tested and found
practicable. If farmers do not obtain financing for their share of
connection costs, lack of interest in becoming connected could conceivably
pose a problem (para. 5.12). To address such risk, at negotiations it was
agreed that the Central Bank will approve a rediscount facility for US$160
million, and CEMIG and COPEL have approached commercial banks to provide
supplementary financing (para. 5.12). Both the borrower and the
beneficiaries have been affected by the financial problems faced by the power
sector, which are being addressed through a program of tariff increases and
cost reduction measures, which will progressively improve the rate of
remuneration for the sector (para. 1.19). Failure to implement the agreed
increases would materially affect the financial prospects of CEMIG and COPEL,
and could result in a slower pace of project execution.
Promotion
5.24      As part of the project, CEMIG will establish several model farms
which will be fully equipped to promote the use of electricity in rural
properties. Model farms would be provided with lodging, teaching facilities
and instructors to demonstrate how electricity may be used to increase



- 33 -
production and save oil and to improve living conditions in rural dwellings.
Potential consumers from the CEMIG project area will be invited to visit
these farms. It is expected that promotion efforts will increase farmers
interest in becoming connected.
Monitoring
5.25      CEMIG and COPEL have agreed to establish monitoring programs which
would select a representative sample of farms to be surveyed before, during
and after project execution in order to evaluate the impact of
electrification on productivity, consumption of oil derivatives and living
conditions; thus providing the basis for comparing the estimated benefits and
the actual benefits of the project. An outline monitoring program was
agreed at negotiations, and its implementation will be followed-up by the
Bank during project execution. Monitoring is expected to provide data for
evaluating future RE projects in Brazil. The agreed monitoring indicators
are presented in Annex 5.4.

6. FINANCES
CEMIG
Financial History and Present Position
6.01      Between 1972 and 1979, CEMIG's electricity sales grew at an average
annual rate of about 15%, which enabled it to increase its operating income
at approximately the same pace (when measured in real terms) despite the
erosion in real tariff levels towards the end of the period. Between 1978
and 1979 average real tariffs fell about 15%, and in 1980 they dropped a
further 1%. As a result, the company, which had consistently been earning a
rate of remuneration in excess of 10%, witnessed its reduction to 8.4% in
1978, and further falls to 7.9% in 1979 and to 7.8% in 1980 (see Annex 6.2).
6.02      The deterioration in CEMIG's tariffs discussed above coincided with
lower sales growth due to macroeconomic factors and with a period in which
conditions in world financial markets tended to tighten. Thus the hitherto
excellent financial situation of the company quickly worsened. As shown in
Annex 6.4, in 1980 net internal cash generation was marginally negative.
6.03      To address these problems the Bank sought agreement with CEMIG,
ELETROBRAS, DNAEE and the state of Minas Gerais on a medium-term investment
and financing program, as provided in section 5.05(c) of the project
agreement with CEMIG under loan 1538-BR. Such agreement was finally reached
in September 1981 and it involved the following:
(a) a revision of CEMIG's investment program;
(b) a commitment from ELETROBRAS to supply counterpart funds for
CEMIG's part of the South-Southeast Power Distribution Project
(partially financed by loan 1538-BR);
(c) a commitment from the Government to increase tariffs as required to
enable CEMIG to earn a rate of remuneration of 8% in 1981 and of
10% in 1982 and thereafter;
(d) a commitment from the State of Minas Gerais to make equity
contributions of US$30 million per year, from 1981 through 1985
and to reinvest dividends and sole tax proceeds; and
(e) a commitment from ELETROBRAS to reinvest dividends, convert into
equity the debt-service on existing projects and to reschedule
existing loans.
6.04      Implementation of the agreement described above - except as regards
tariffs, where it was overriden by the general agreement with the Government
approved shortly after (para. 1.18) - resulted in an improvement in CEMIG's
finances and in its prospects. Thus, in 1981 CEMIG was able to increase its
average tariffs to a level close, in real terms, to the one it had in 1978.
In 1982 these improvements did not continue, partly because delays in
approving the tariff increases agreed with the Bank (para. 1.19) resulted in



- 35 -
an average real tariff about 4% lower than in 1981 and also because sales
growth was slow due to the severe recession. CEMIG's present financial
situation is poor: the company barely manages to cover its debt service
through its internal cash generation and is relying heavily on borrowings to
fund its investment needs.
Investment and Financing Plans
6.05      In 1972 CEMIG's generating capacity was 1117 MW and it served less
than 500,000 customers; by 1982 generating capacity had been increased to
3867 MW and the number of customers to over 1,900,000. The investments
required to achieve such growth wre substantial, especially because the
increase of generating capacity was through construction of hydroelectric
projects. For the near future, with the 1000 MW Emborcacao project already
in operation, and excess generating capacity in Southeastern Brazil due to
the commissioning of Itaipu, CEMIG will not require large investments in
generationl'/, and investments in transmission that are needed are not large
either. Th7s, the company is aiming to sharply increase distribution
efforts, through the IDB financed Minas-Luz program (para. 5.04), the
proposed rural electrification project, and additional distribution that will
be funded without assistance from the international financial institutions.
In the coming years annual investments are expected to amount to about US$
250 million equivalent per year (see Annex 6.5).

(para. 1.13), but their timing has been delayed about two years, due to
expectations of slower market growth.

Source: Annex 6.4 (details on the investment program are provided in Annex
6.5.
6.07      As may be seen in the preceding table, CEMIG's net internal cash
generation is expected to be negative, due to heavy debt service
requirements, and net consumer-based contributions would only finance about
5% of total funding requirements. The balance is to be financed through
equity contributions, consumer contributions and borrowings, mostly the
latter. About half of these borrowings correspond to disbursements on loans
already obtained or presently under negotiation, and the total of proposed
borrowings is in line with the amounts CEMIG obtained in recent years. It is
expected that most of the proposed new borrowings would originate from
foreign sources. To the extent that - for macroeconomic reasons - such
credit may not be available it would have to be offset by increases in other
sources of financing. CEMIG's finances as discussed below, are expected to
progressively improve so that by 1988 nearly 30% of investment requirements
would be financed by net consumer-based contributions.
Financial Outlook
6.08      CEMIG's financial outlook was significantly affected by the
February 1983 30% devaluation of the cruzeiro, as a large proportion of the
company's debt is denominated in foreign currency. The devaluation, in



- 37 -
conjunction with stagnation in sales and an increased wage bill, is expected
to result in a lower rate of remuneration in 1983 than in 1982: 4.1% against
5.9% (Annex 6.2). Starting in 1984, however, CEMIG's prospects are expected
to improve as increased sales and higher tariffs result in progressively
higher levels of operating income (Annex 6.1). CEMIG's rate of remuneration
is expected to steadily improve during the period of project execution, and
would reach 9.3% by 1988.
6.09      The expected improvement in CEMIG's finances would be reflected in
a net internal cash generation which, despite CEMIG's very heavy debt
service, will become positive by 1988 and in a falling debt equity ratio,
which would go from 55:45 in 1983 to 47:53 in 1988 (Annexes 6.3 and 6.4).
6.10      The favorable trend expected in CEMIG's finances is subject to
diverse risks, arising both from the uncertainties associated with the
prospects of the economy, and from factors specific to the sector. Among the
latter we may note that CEMIG is required by contract to purchase one sixth
of Itaipu's energy output. The price assumed in the financial forecasts for
such purchases is likely to be too low to meet Itaipu's financial
requirements and there is a risk (to CEMIG) that it may have to be
significantly higher. This would have a significant impact on CEMIG's
operating costs, of which by 1988 over 40% would be given by energy
purchases, and could conceivably absorb a sizeable part of the increased
revenues upon which the expected improvement in CEMIG's finances depends. To
address this risk, at negotiations the Government undertook to promptly take
all measures necessary to offset the impact of increases in Itaipu's tariffs,
so that the agreed rates of remuneration are met (para. 1.20).
6.11      To ensure that its financial performance will be satisfactory, at
negotiations CEMIG agreed that: (a) the standard provisions of Bank loans to
power companies in Brazil, which inter alia, provide that tariffs should be
set at such level as to provide a rate of remuneration of not less than 10%
will be repeated (in the understanding that in the coming years they will not
be strictly enforced, provided that the Government honors its commitments
under the September 1981 agreement on tariff policy, as amended (para.
1.19); and (b) the standard provision of Bank loans to power companies which
require the Bank's concurrence before incurring in new debts if the
debt-service coverage ratio falls below 1.5) and (c) the provisions of
section 4.06 of the loan 1538-BR project agreement (major projects clause)
will be repeated. Additionally the state of Minas Gerais agreed, at
negotiations, to reinvest proceeds of the sole tax and dividends in CEMIG and
to invest in CEMIG's capital stock US$30 million in 1984, US$30 million in
1985 and US$30 million in 1986.
COPEL
Financial History and Present Position
6.12      Over the past ten years COPEL's electricity sales increased at an
average annual rate of about 17%. To achieve this growth the company
carried-out an ambitious investment program (which, from 1975 on, included
the large Foz do Areia hydroelectric project), connecting new consumers to
the grid at an average rate of about 21% per year. This investment policy
was enabled by equity contributions from the State and Municipal governments,



- 38 -
consumer contributions and a contribution to investment from internally
generated funds which on average represented about 20% of financial
requirements. This contribution to investment ratio may be directly linked
to COPEL's rate of return performance. From 1972 to 1977, COPEL was able to
earn rates of remuneration of 10% or higher (though, from 1975 on, this was
only possible because the firm received additional revenues through its
participation in the Global Guarantee Fund).
6.13      From 1978 on, COPEL's rate of remuneration fell (it was 8.0% in
1978, 7.5% in 1979, 5.5% in 1980, 6.1 in 1981 and 6.3% in 1982) but, despite
this, the company was able to maintain a positive contribution to investment
ratio, which by 1982 was again at the 30% level (Annex 6.12). At present,
COPEL has a reasonable financial structure for a utility of its size. The
debt-equity ratio is 51:49, which is acceptable. However, the average term
of its debts is short and a high proportion of these debts is in foreign
currency. Thus the company was badly affected by the February 1983
devaluation, and in 1983 its debt service coverage ratio is expected to fall
to 1.0.
6.14      COPEL's working capital requirements are kept low through an
efficient collection policy, which allows the company to collect its accounts
receivable 35/40 days from billing date, and through computer-assisted daily
cash-flow forecasting which enables it to keep cash balances at a low level
(about eight days of operational requirements). It may be noted that this
assessment reflects an improvement over the situation detected when loan
1721-BR was appraised, at which time (November 1978) the company had a long
collection period (68 days).
Investment and Financing Plans
6.15      COPEL's investment program for the 1984-1988 period is heavily
weighed by the Segredo hydroelectric projectll/, which is expected to
require about US$400 million (in 1983 constant prices), representing close to
half of the company's investment budget. In addition, COPEL is also
proposing an ambitious investment program in distribution, both in urban and
in rural areas (see Annex 6.11).
6.16      Financing for Segredo has been substantially secured, through a
loan from IDB (US$100 million) cofinancing from commercial banks (US$100
million) and local loans from ELETROBRAS, Agencia Especial de Financiamiento
Industrial (FINAME) and Banco Nacional de Habitacao (BNH), complemented by
equity contributions from the State Government.
6.17      The following table shows COPEL's investment and financing plan for
1984-1988.
11/ This project on the Iguacu river is part of an integrated plan for its
development. It will have a firm power potential of 640 MW and an
installed capacity, in its first phase, of 1260 MW. Construction had
been initially scheduled to start in March 1983, and commercial
operation in 1988; however, due to slower market growth it has now been
decided to postpone it by about two years.

6.18      The financing plan summarized in the preceding table is reason-
able. About 50% of the company' requirements would be financed from borrow-
ings and the balance by internally generated funds (24%) and consumer and
equity contributions (26%). Of the programmed borrowings most will be
applied to finance the Segredo hydroproject, and have already been nego-
tiated.
Financial Outlook
6.19      After absorbing the effect of the February 1983 devaluation, which
- because of the large amount of debts denominated in foreign currency - is
significant, and will be reflected in lower debt service coverage and
self-financing ratios, COPEL's finances are expected to improve during the
period of project execution as a consequence of increased earnings, which
will allow the company to progressively reduce the share of borrowings as a
source of financing from about 65% in 1984 to 40% in 1988. Such improvement
in earnings is expected to be caused by sales growing at an average rate of
about 8% per year, and by real tariffs increases in accordance with the
agreements reached with the Government (para. 1.19), while operating costs
are forecasted to grow at a slower pace (Annex 6.7). Thus, the operating
ratio (the ratio of operating costs to operating revenues) which was .72 in
1982 is expected to progressively fall, to reach .49 by 1988. However, like
CEMIG (para. 6.10), COPEL will be purchasing a share (albeit smaller) of
Itaipu's output and will be subject to cost increases if the price of
Itaipu's energy were to be increased above the levels forecasted. The
asurances provided by the Government on this matter (para. 1.20) would
address this risk.
6.20      The forecast financial indicators (see Annex 6.12), show that the
debt-equity ratio would fall from 49:51 in 1982 to 41:59 by 1S'-, il--    cue'
u.LeUL service coverage ratio which is expected to fall to 1.0 in 1983 would
improve to 2.3 by 1988. The forecasts assume that net current assets will
continue to be kept at a minimum and in fact a further reduction of the
collection period from its already low level of 35 days at present to 29 days
by 1988 is expected. Such evolution would keep the current ratio low but at
levels which based on recent experience seem adequate to address COPEL's
liquidity requirements. Detailed financial forecasts are shown in Annexes
6.7 - 6.12.
6.21      To ensure that its financial performance will be satisfactory, at
negotiations COPEL agreed that: (a) the standard provisions of Bank loans to
power companies in Brazil which provide that tariffs to be set at such level
as to provide a rate of remuneration of not less than 10% (in the
understanding that in the coming years such commitment will not'be strictly
enforced, provided that the Government honors its commitments under the
September 1981 agreement, as amended, on tariff policy - paras. 1.18-1.19)
will be repeated, (b) the standard provision of Bank loans to power
companies, which requires Bank's concurrence to incur in new long-term debt
if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.5 will be applicable, and
(c) the provision of section 5.05 of loan 1721-BR which requires the
agreement of the Bank to the carrying out of new major projects will be
repeated. Additionally the state of Parana agreed, at negotiations, to
reinvest the proceeds of the sole tax and dividends in COPEL and to take all
measures necessary to ensure timely project completion.

7. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
7.01      Brazil has developed a long-range generation and transmission
investment program which optimizes project choice on a country-wide basis,
through application of modern mathematical programming techniques (para.
1,13), which have been reviewed by the Bank and found to be acceptable. The
execution of this program will require CEMIG and COPEL to carry out the
generation and transmission investments included in their expansion programs
(paras. 4.06 and 4.11). Detailed distribution planning is under the
responsibility of each utility. CEMIG and COPEL's R.E. projects are part of
the medium-term distribution expansion plans of both agencies. They have
been optimized based on the criteria outlined below:
First. At present there is a large unfilled demand for electricity
in the rural areas of Minas Gerais and Parana. Based on data collected by
the utilities, there is a substantial number of prospective consumers that
are willing to be connected, can afford to pay 50% or more of connection
costs, and can reasonably be expected to be able to obtain financing if
needed for such purpose. The project is basically addressed to such
population group (it also includes network extensions to connect 56,000
village and low-income consumers which wuld be fully financed by the
utilities). The size of the program has been designed to take into account
the utilities' executing capabilities, and the financial difficulties now
faced by the utilities.
Second.  The areas to be electrified in each state vere selected
through the application of a ranking method for the selection of priority
areas suitable for electrification, as discussed in para. 5.08. Such
selection ensures that electrification will be carried out first in those
counties within the concession area of each of the tw beneficiaries where
the available economic indicators suggest that the benefit/cost ratio is
likely to be higher.
Third. The network extensions were compared to the alternative of
using diesel-fired generation in isolated rural areas, and the project only
includes such extensions that were shown to be less costly than this
alternative.
Fourth. Technical standards (such as transmission voltage, type of
poles, distance between poles and size of conductors) were chosen through an
economic comparison of alternatives, given a set of standards of minimum
reliability, which are reasonable. It is expected that, during project
implementation, CEMIG and COPEL will continue testing simplified standards
which could reduce the cost of rural networks. At negotiations, they agreed
to keep the Bank periodically informed on their progress and conclusions in
this matter.
Return on Investment
7.02      On the basis of detailed surveys of farms already electrified (some
of which have more than fifteen years of data), and with the guidance of the



- 42 -
Bank, CEMIG and COPEL prepared economic justifications of their respective
subprojects which take into account the benefits from the incremental sales
of electricity, fuel substitution and increase in agricultural production
attributable to the project. Such analyses show economic rates of return
over 13% - higher than the opportunity cost of capital. The Bank reviewed
the economic evaluations and considered them satisfactory as a first check of
the economic viability of the project. However, the subprojects are part of
the overall expansion programs of the two utilities, and are complementary to
other investments in generation, transmission and general facilities that
either were completed in the past, are being carried out now, or will be
required during the period of project execution. Therefore, cost allocation
to the project requires applying arbitrary hypotheses and thus an economic
evaluation of the overall investment programs provides more meaningful
results.
7.03      Thus, return on investment was estimated as being provided by the
discount rate which equates the present values of the costs and of the
benefits attributed to the investment programs which would be carried out by
CEMIG and COPEL between 1984 and 1988. Benefits were measured by forecast
revenues from the incremental sales of electricity which may be reasonably
attributed to the carrying out of such investment programs, using tariffs as
of December 31, 1983, plus the sole tax and consumer contributions towards
the investment program. Costs were measured at market prices. To adjust
costs and benefits in local currency to border prices, a shadow exchange rate
20% higher than the market rate was used. The data is summarized in Annex
7. The result obtained is an equalization rate of about 9%. Despite the
exchange rate adjustment discussed above, this is essentially a financial
rate of return as revenues from tariffs are used as a proxy for benefits,
thus understating the actual returns to the economy, since the benefits to
consumers may substantially exceed the regulated prices they are charged.
7.04      Since, as indicated above, benefits are measured through
incremental revenues, the results above confirm the need to progressively
increase tariffs until the sector average rate of remuneration reaches 10%
and past shortfalls are recovered. Without considering shortfall recovery,
achieving the agreed tariff goal will require tariff increases amounting to
about 25% in real terms above the projected December 1983 level , which if
they resulted in a revenue increase of only 20% (due to some reduction in
demand growth - even though available data suggests that price elasticity is
extremely low -), would increase the equalizing rate to 11% for both
companies combined. This figure is in line with the long run opportunity
cost of capital in Brazil.

8.   AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      In addition to the standard clauses in power projects, during
negotiations agreement was reached on the following matters:
(a)  With the Government:
(i)  that if Itaipu tariffs were increased above the levels now
forecasted by Eletrobras, the Government would promptly take
all measures required to provide to the power companies the
additional resources to offset the ensuing cost increases and
achieve the rates of remuneration agreed with the Bank (para.
1.20);
(ii)  that ELETROBRAS would review, coordinate and evaluate the
R.E. programs of all electric-power companies (para. 2.05);
(iii)  that there would be an exchange of views with the Bank on the
recommendations of the R.E. study (para. 2.06) and that there
would not be an increase in the level of existing subsidies
included in the electricity rates to rural consumers until the
completion of this study (para. 2.07).
(iv)  that a rediscount facility of US$160 million to finance the
consumer-borne share of connection costs would be created by
the Central Bank, and that annual appropriations under this
line, would be in amounts consistent with project requirements
(para. 5.12).
(b)   With the States of Minas Gerais and of Parana that the proceeds of
the sole tax and dividends would be reinvested in CEMIG and COPEL,
respectively (paras. 6.11 and 6.21), and with the State of Minas
Gerais that it would also invest in the capital stock of CEMIG not
less than US$30 million per year in 1984, 1985 and 1986 (para.
6.11).
(c)   With ELETROBRAS:
(i)  that a R.E. unit with appropriate functions and
responsibilities (para. 2.05) would be established; on the
terms of reference for the proposed R.E. study, and that
consultants for the study would be engaged by June 30, 1984;
and that there would be an exchange of views on the
consultants' recommendations (para. 2.06);
(ii) that onlending to CEMIG and to COPEL would be on the same
terms and conditions as the Bank loan (para. 3.01);
(d) With CEMIG and COPEL
(i) that they would annually furnish their training programs, and
would provide such additional justification as may be
reasonably required regarding the Bank-financed components
(paras. 3.16 and 3.23);



- 44 -
(ii)  that they would seek supplementary Bank financing to
consumers, as required to ensure timely project completion
(para. 5.12);
(iii)  that they would seek Bank concurrence before incurring
long-term debts if the debt service coverage ratio were lower
than 1.5 and that they would consult the Bank before carrying
out new major projects (paras. 6.11 and 6.21.)
(iv)  that they would test new technical R.E. standards and inform
the Bank on the results (para. 7.01).
8.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that the R.E. unit has
been established and its head has been appointed (para. 2.05), and that
subsidiary loan agreements between ELETROBRAS and CEMIG and COPEL, which are
satisfactory to the Bank, have been signed (para. 3.01).
8.03      Any change in sector legislation, or failure to implement the
tariff agreements (paras. 1.18-1.19), which may adversely affect the
operAtions or financial performance of ELETROBRAS, CEMIG or COPEL would be an
event of default.
8.04      With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$222.8 million, to be repaid over a period of 15
years, including three years of grace.

TI Missien estimate.
41  For projection purposes it w3s assuned that average tariffs will increase 7X per year, in real terms, until the rate of resmaeration for the power sector as
a whole reaches 1I% and past shortfalls have been recovered. lIe agreenents reached on this matter (para. 1.19) are oxnsistent with this assumption as in
1984 and 1985 tariffs will increase 5% each year, ard cost reductions, through wge increases loser than inflation, will provide an additional increase In
operating incore equivalent to sat wuld have been achieved it tariffs had been further increased  an additicnal 2 yearly.
5/  Pdrchases frmn Furnas are based on the January 3, 1974 agreerent; purrhases fror Itaipu sere estisrted using the tariff forecasts provided by Eletrobras.
Such tariffs,houever, wMuld not suffioe to meet Itaipu's financial requirements.  CW1G is entitled, and is required to take, one sixth of Itaipu's output.
6/  Fixed assets sere depreciated at an average annual rate of 3.21, the accornt also inclhdes avortization of deferred charges.
7/  The nutiber of staff uas forecasted to increase at a slower pace than the meter of cesuarers, allowing the custaoer/employees ratio to livrme about 3% per
year.
8/  The reversion quota is paid to ELgEIRlAS and the guarantee quota to  ME. The former sea calculated as 4% (in 1984 and 1985, and 3X tbereaftar) of
year-end assets in operation, in accordanee with tbe sector projections sulr7itted by Eletrobras to the Bark in June 1983. The guarantee quDta iad
equalize the oewpany's rate of remureration to the sector average; sinrc CeF G's rate of remuneration will te loser than sich average (based on Eletrobras
forecasts, adjusted to reflect anumal real tariff increases of 7%) it has been assumed that the rowpany will not have to pay guarantee quota from 1984
through 1988.
9/ Values set by the Coordinating Group for Intierconnected Operations based on each ocipany's share of the market, for the purpose of allocating the nast of

10/ The 1980-1982 figures %ere obtained from audited statenents. Generally accepted accounting principles in Brazil, in tie ratter of accounting for the
effects of inflation, differ somesiat from generally accepted accounting principles in rost other ounttries. The effects of inflation are estimasted: (a) by'
t7e  roietary statewent of permmaent assets and of the equity accounts, based on the variation in the nminal value of the ORIN, and (b) financial assets and
liabilities that are subject to irnexation, or exchange rate changes, are restated to reflect values at balance sbeet dates.

1/  In billions of current cruzeiros.  Subject to review and approval by DNAEE.  CEMIG does not expect significant adjustments from
this review.
2/  In billions of end-of-1983 constant cruzeiros.  The year-end rate of exchange used for the projections was Cr$886 - 1 US$.
3/ Mission estimate.
T/ Year average of gross plant in service, it also includes some deferred assets shown in the balance sheet as "other assets".
S/ Exchange rate devaluation losses arising from the 1979 and 1983 maxidevaluations. They have been authorized based on the
amortization schedule of the corresponding foreign loans, which is the procedure approved by DNAEE to handle the 1979 exchange
rate losses. It is likely that the losses arising from the 1983 maxidevaluation will be handled somewhat differently, and will be
amortized over a longer period of time. Such policy would result in a reduction in the rate of remuneration in 1983 and in
increases in the following years, but these changes are not expected to be significant.
6/  Allowance for inventories.
7/  These figures are all estimates since, as indicated in footnote 1, DNAEE has yet to approve the accounts.
T/  The forecasts assume that DNAEE will allow full inclusion of all costs incurred in the cost of service, for rate of remuneration
purposes. Historical experience shows, however, that some costs are disallowed and - in fact - CEMIG's rate of remuneration
calculations for 1980 and 1981 only include as cost of service about 97X of the operating costs shown in the income statement.
9/  Calculated as the balance at the end of the previous year, appropriately revalued, plus the difference between the remuneration
tha company would have earned had its rate of remuneration been 10 and its actual remuneration (shown in line 14).

1/  In billions of current cruzeiros.
2! In billions of end-of-1983 constant cruzeiros. (A rate of exchange of Cr$866 - 1US$ was assumed).
3/ Mission estimate.
! Through 1983 annually revalued by the variation in the ORTN index (see Annex 6.1, footnote 10).
5!  Annual depreciation is calculated using the following rates:  thermal plants and intangibles 5%, distribution assets 4% and other assets 3%.
6! Net of allowance for doubtful accounts, which is calculated on the basis of past experience. A reduction in collection periods, from 55 days forecast for
1983 to 50 days in 1984 and thereafter has been assumed.
7/ Valued at average cost, forecast as a proportion of gross plant in service (after adjustment for differences in valuation criteria).
8/  Mainly investments in other companies and deferred charges corresponding to studies for future generation and transmission projects.
9/ Mainly interest charged to work in progress, shown separate from these as a deferred charge.
TO/ As of December 31, 1982 CEMIG had outstanding common shares with a par value of Cr$40.6 billion and preferred shares with a par value of Cr55.5 billion.
Preferred shares are entitled to a minimum dividend of 10% per year and to participate on an equal basis with common shares if such shares receive
dividends above 10%.  The net results of monetary correction are accumulated in a reserve account.-
11/ As of December 31, 1982 about 47% of all debts were denominated in foreign currency, valued at the exchange rate as of year-end.  Debts denominated in
cruzeiros were, except for a small amount owed to A.I.D., subject to monetary correction.

.1/ The average tariffs were converted to Decenber 1983 price levels by mnltiplying the actual average tariff by the ratio of the forecasted general prioe index
as of Deembxer 1983 to the average value of the general price Index in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983, as appropriate. Tariff forecasts reflect the agreements

3  Estimated.
4/ See footnote 4 to Akex 6.1, which is applicable also to COPEL
5/ For 1983 energy purchases include normal purchases from CEP, the Itaipu quota for the fourth quarter, plus omplementary
purchases fron ELZnCSUL. For 1984-88 only the quota to he purchased frmn Itaipu has been comsidered. In 1983 this scheme will,
for C(FEL, be suboptinel as it is purchasing energy it is able to generate frcn its otn facilities.
6/ Depreciation ass calculated at the average annual rate of 3.2/ on fixed assets in service, the account also includes amDrtization of
deferred charges (at a rate of 4% per year) and of special exclange differences (occassioned by the Decenber 1979 mad-devaluation), at
the pace at which tbe loans which originated such differences are amortized.
7/ COPEL's has forecast salary expenses on the basis of the expected mnmbers of aosuners connected anrd of a progressive increase in
efficiency, reflected in the ixprovenent of the casuer per enployee ratio from 138 in 1982 to 181 in 1988. Other costs ware
estimated on the basis of past trends.
8/ The forecast assumes that ODPEL will not be required to contribute to the Glolbl QGarantee Fund until 1988, since through 1987 CDPEL's
rate of renuneration wild be lower than the average for the sector (forecasted based on the projections developed by Eletrobras).
9/ See Annex 6.1, footnote 10.
10/ According to COPEL's statutes, its wirkers are entitled to a share of profits equal to 1.5 nenthly salaries.

11 The average tariffs were converted to December 1983 price levels by multiplying the actual average tariff by the ratio of
the forecasted general price index as of December 1983 to the average value of the general price index in 1980, 1981 and
1982, as apropriate.

4/ Ratio of operating costs to operating revenues.
5/ Due to the effects of inflation, the ratio of accounts receivable at year-end to annual operating revenues provides a
highly biased estimate of the collection period. To adjust for this, operating revenues were first recalculated at
estimated end-of-year tariff levels, and the collection period was estimated by relating accounts receivable at year-end
to this adjusted figure.
6/ Ratio of gross internal cash generation to debt service requirements in the year. Differs from the ratio that would be
checked during project execution and which, if it fell below 1.5, would require prior Bank agreement if the company
wishes to incur in new long term debt, in that this ratio would compare gross internal cash generation to debt service
requirements in the current and all future years.

Return on Investment Calculations
Basic Assumptions
1.        A shadow exchange rate 20% higher than the official market rate was
used to convert cost and benefit figures accruing in local currency.
Costs
2.        Investment figures were obtained from annexes 6.5 and 6.11.  They
include provision for physical contingencies. The average life assumed for
the investments in the program is 25 years.
3.        Incremental operating and maintenance expenditures were estimated
by the appraisal mission on the basis of historical ratios.
4.        The energy generated in CEMIG's and COPEL's systems is 100% hydro,
and will continue so in the planning horizon. Accordingly the cost of
generating the energy to meet the incremental sales attributed to the program
has been estimated as given by the investments in generation included in the
program. Such investments represent about 23% of CEMIG's program and 43% of
COPEL's program. However, since COPEL will have to purchase energy during a
transition period until the commissioning of Segredo, the costs of such
purchases were also included in the cost stream. From a country point of
view, such purchases of energy generated from hydro sources in other regions
would not cause an economic cost, and in this sense, the rate of return on
investment is an underestimate.
Benefits
5.        Incremental sales result from: (a) new connections, and (b)
increased sales to consumers already connected. Benefits were measured at
December 1982 tariff levels. The following proportions of forecast
incremental sales (for both CEMIG and COPEL) were attributed to the program
1984 10%, 1985 1/ 30%, 1986 50%, 1987 70%, 1988 90%, 1989 70%, 1990 50%, 1991
30%, 1992 0%.
6.        Consumer contribution figures were obtained from annexes 6.4 and
6.10.
1/ A sensisitiviy analysis using lower proportions (i.e. 10% in 1984, 20% in
1985, 40% in 1986, 60% in 1987, 90% in 1988, 60% in 1989, 40% in 1990,
and 20% in 1991) resulted in lowering the equalizing discount rate from
9% to 7%.
