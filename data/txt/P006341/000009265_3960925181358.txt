MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Brazil
Rural Electrification Prolect (Loan 2365-BR)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on
Brazil - Rural Electrification Project (Loan 2365-BR)" prepared by the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office with the Borrower providing Part II of
the report.
The project's physical targets were exceeded.   Lower unit costs,
improved technical standards, and competitive pressures of ICB made possible a
652  increase in the number of connections  above that anticipated during
appraisal, with a 2X decrease in expenditure.
The PCR is informative but contains no quantification of project
benefits.  Impact monitoring and evaluation studies will be completed in 1993.
These studies are of critical importance in deciding whether similar projects
should be implemented in the future. Using the FRR as a proxy indicator of the
project's development success until these studies are completed, the project is
rated as unsatisfactory.
The project has failed to meet its financial objectives, as has, in
general, the Brazilian power aector. At current power prices, the project has
a negative financial rate of return (FRR), which if continued over a sustained
period would make it difficult for the power companies to cover the costs of
repair and maintenance.   Thus,  the sustainability of project benefits  is
uncertain.
An audit of the project may be carried out after the evaluation studies
have been completed by the Borrower.

LOAN 2365-BR
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Rural
Electrification (RE) Project, for which Loan 2365-BR (US$222.8 million) was
approved on December 8, 1983. The borrower and lesser beneficiary was Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras, SA (ELETROBRAS), the public-sector corporation which
serves as holding company for the Federal power utilities and which performs
sector-wide planning and financial functions.   The major beneficiaries and
executing agencies were Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG) and
Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL), the state-owned power companies of their
respective states.
The project consisted of: (i) works and equipment to expand the rural
distribution systems of the executing agencies; (ii) training and technical
assistance to upgrade staff; and  (iii) a study of RE problems.   With the
agreement of the Bank, the size and scope of both subprojects were substantially
increased. Both companies completed the enlarged subprojects in 1989 (except for
a handful of connections in 1990); they had surpassed the appraisal targets for
new connections in 1987, the original target completion date.   The loan was
closed on June 30, 1990; and the last disbursement was on September 18, 1991.
The Energy and Industry Operations Division, Country Department I
(Brazil, Venezuela, and Peru) prepared this PCR based on, inter alia: (i) final
project reports prepared by CEMIG and COPEL; (ii) Bank sources, including the
loan documents, supervision reports, and Bank-beneficiary correspondence; and
(iii) interviews with Bank staff.  Preparation of this PCR began in July 1992.
A draft of this report (Parts I and III) was sent to the borrower and
beneficiaries. Their comments were incorporated into the PCR as Part II.

RURAL ELECTRIFICATION (RE) PROJECT
LOAN 2365-BR
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Description.   Loan 2365-BR (US$222.8 million) helped to
finance a rural electrification project consisting of works and equipment
(substations, lines, circuits, etc.) plus technical assistance, training, and a
study of RE problems. The project objectives were: (a) increased agricultural
production through electrified irrigation; (b) fuel savings as a result of
substitution of electricity for petroleum products; and (c) improved rural living
conditions.
The borrower and lesser beneficiary was Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras, SA, the Federal holding company which has sector-wide planning and
financial functions.   The major beneficiaries and executing agencies were
Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG) and Companhia Paranaense de Energia
(COPEL), the state power companies of their respective states. As measured by
actual and forecast numbers of connections, completion dates, costs, etc.,
implementation of the project was a success. However, as explained later, final
judgement on the economic performance of this project remains a question.
Actual and Forecast Cost and Proiect Timetable. Actual expenditures
amounted to US$572.2 million, 2.1% less than the appraisal forecast (US$584.7
million).   Due to lower unit costs,  improved technical standards, and the
beneficial impact of international competitive bidding, there was an 83% increase
in the number of new connections over the level anticipated at appraisal. The
Bank agreed to the enlarged scope and greater size of the project. Given such
enlargement, the actual cost of the completed project is not fully comparable
with the cost anticipated at appraisal.  The project, except for a few dozen
connections carried out in early 1990, was carried out between 1984 and 1989.
By December 30, 1987, the original project completion date, CEMIG and COPEL had
exceeded the appraisal targets for new rural connections.
Project Issues. At appraisal, due to a lack of uniform standards for
defining and evaluating RE projects, project-design methodology was an issue and
the subject of extensive discussion within the Bank. To resolve this matter, it
was agreed that the study of RE problems would address, inter alia, the technical
and economic issues related to project justification.   The completed study
established that it was possible to calculate an economic rate of return for an
RE project based on benefits including increased agricultural production due to
electrification plus the savings on fuel costs by substituting electricity for
petroleum products. As the executing agencies are still gathering data, this
report does not include a calculation of the economic rate of return of the
project. This information may be of key importance in deciding whether similar
projects should be considered in the future.



The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) pointed out that CEMIG and COPEL
were carrying out their: (i) generation/transmission programs in conformity with
a least-cost national expansion plan approved by the Bank; and (ii) RE projects
optimized on the basis of: (a) technical standards chosen through an economic
comparison of alternatives; (b) a large unfilled demand for electricity in rural
areas; and (c) ranking of areas to be electrified according to criteria
suggesting higher benefit/cost ratios. Pending completion of the RE study and
identification of the benefits of an RE project, the SAR did not include a
calculation of the rate of return for the project as part of its economic
justification. Instead, the SAR justified the project economically because of
its being part of the combined CEMIG-COPEL expansion programs for 1984-1988,
which had a projected internal rate of return of 9%.
Macroeconomic  and  Sector  Events.    Notwithstanding  successful
collaboration on the part of Brazilian power authorities and Bank staff to plan
(1982-1983) and execute (1984-1989) the project, Bank lending to  the power
sector declined during the 1980s (and stopped altogether in 1992) due to a
combination of macroeconomic deterioration and Government policies toward the
sector.
Concerning economic events, when Mr. Sarney took office as President
in 1985, Brazil was experiencing an export-led boom; however, inflation was at
a high level. Given his weak political mandate and the strong opposition of
Congress, the President resorted to anti-inflation programs relying on price
controls, unsupported by significant fiscal/monetary measures and requiring
minimum or no sacrifice from any major political group. The three macroeconomic
stabilization plans -- Cruzado, 1986; Bresser, 1987; and Summer, 1989 -- were not
successful; and the economy suffered from "stop-start" growth, high rates of
inflation, large public-sector deficits, and problems servicing foreign debt.
Following the failure of the Bresser Plan, the Bank designed (1988) a lending
strategy based on the concept of "graduated response" to policy and institutional
change -- that is, the level of lending would depend on the comprehensiveness and
credibility of the Government's stabilization and adjustment efforts.
During project planning and execution (1982-1989), political and
short-run inflationary considerations dominated the regulatory approach of the
Federal Government to the sector. Such considerations led to low sector tariffs,
and hence to inadequate levels of internally generated resources and declining
ratios of financial performance.   In 1981, 1983, and 1986, the Bank and the
Government agreed on plans to restore sector finances, relying on a combination
of tariff increases and other measures. The 1986 plan included financial targets
consistent with the Cruzado Plan, i.e., modest tariff increases in 1986 followed
by larger tariff increases in 1987 and later years. Like the plans of 1981 and
1983, the 1986 plan failed to achieve more than short-term improvement primarily
because the Government chose strategic objectives other than the financial
rehabilitation of the sector.
Following agreement on the 1983 plan for sector financial
rehabilitation, the Bank continued to make investment loans supporting power
projects in Brazil, even though the Government did not raise tariffs and the
financial performance of the sector did not improve as expected. With a power
sector adjustment loan (2720-BR; US$500 million; 1986), the Bank supported the
Cruzado Plan; and planned a second power sector adjustment loan in 1987 (also
US$500 million), provided that the sector met certain financial targets in 1986
and provided there was good reason to expect compliance with financial targets



- iv -
in 1987. The Bank and the Government could not agree on the terms for a second
sector adjustment loan. In June 1990 the Bank approved an investment loan (3227-
BR) which required the Government to raise and maintain tariffs at a level
equivalent to US$54/MWh (in prices of July 1989). Since loan approval, tariffs
in real terms have declined from about to US$50/MWh to about US$42/MWh (in prices
of July 1989). In April 1992, with no prospect of near-term loan signature or
increases of tariffs to covenanted levels, the Bank withdrew the loan.
Institutional  Performance.    CEMIG and COPEL  implemented their
respective RE projects efficiently and collaborated well with the Bank. During
1984-1988, their actual and forecast financial performances were reasonably
close, as measured by sales, average tariffs, revenues, and most key financial
indicators. In the case of CEMIG, summarized sales and revenues exceeded fore-
cast levels by a healthy margin because of the acquisition of concessionaires.
However, the financial performance of both companies was being undermined by
rising unit labor costs.
At CEMIG, the rising level of total personnel expenses reflected: (i)
less-than-expected improvements to efficiency due to the acquisition of less
efficient concessionaires; and (ii) rising unit labor costs (as measured by
average personnel expense).  By 1988, CEMIG's ratio of customers per employee was
well below the target ratio (176 vs. 198). By 1989, the ratio was 163. COPEL
was more successful than CEMIG in this area. In 1988, its ratio of customers to
personnel was 183 as compared with the forecast level of 181. In 1989, the ratio
had improved to 187.
Compounding CEMIG's declining efficiency were increases in unit
labor costs.  By 1989, the average personnel expense, Cr$13,645 (in constant
prices of December 1983), was 78% higher than the average personnel expense of
1984 (CrS7,659).   For COPEL, the increase was 125% (1989: Cr$12,013; 1984:
Cr$5336 -- in constant prices of December 1983). Both companies made the point
that there had not been an increase in their base average salary. Instead, the
increase was due to social charges and "premiums" for longevity, increased
productivity, etc.
In the final analysis, the financial performance of CEMIG and COPEL
reflected the impact of factors outside the control of company management. The
Federal Government establishes policy with respect to levels of tariffs,
investment expenditure, and borrowing and the state government establishes
operating and personnel policy. In such circumstances, the managements of CEMIG
and COPEL are severely restricted in their autonomy.
The Bank identified the right technical issues at appraisal; and
negotiated loan documents consistent with project and sector objectives. Except
for not reviewing the sector RE study, the level and extent of Bank supervision
were appropriate, as the executing agencies were competent.
Internal Rate of Return on the Combined Investment Programs. The
internal rate of return of the combined programs based on actual costs and
benefits was - 10.7% -- a reflection of the current low level of tariffs and the
high level of labor costs.   If tariffs had been maintained at the level
prevailing in 1988, the highest level during the last five years, the economic
rate of return on the combined investment programs would have been zero.



v 
Lessons to be Learned. This project has three lessons. (a) The
lower-than-expected unit costs for materials and equipment demonstrate the
usefulness of ICB. (b) While final data for calculating the internal rate of
return of the project remains pending, the enthusiastic response of the rural
populations to electrification appears to confirm their perception of it.
usefulness, especially their perception of enhanced options and alternatives. (c)
It seems clear that lending in circumstances of continuing financial
deterioration, as occurred between 1981 and 1986, sends the borrower the wrong
message and leads to a significant risk that agreements for financial
rehabilitation will not be observed. In April 1992, the Bank withdrew Loan 3227-
BR after waiting almost two years for signature and the tariff increases required
for effectiveness. This appears to be the right way to maintain the credibility
of the Bank.

2. Backaround
2.01        Borrower and Beneficiaries.   Between 1982 and 1989, the Bank and
Brazilian power officials successfully collaborated to prepare and execute the
Rural Electrification (RE) Project which is the subject of this report. The Bank
supported this project with Loan 2365-BR, amounting to US$222.8 million. The
borrower and lesser beneficiary was Centrais Eletricas Brasilerias, SA (ELETRO-
BRAS), the Federal holding company. Except for a carrying out a study of the
problems of rural electrification, ELETROBRAS played no role with respect to
project execution. The Bank monitored the study, but did not otherwise supervise
ELETROBRAS. This report follows the same approach. The major beneficiaries were
the executing agencies, Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CEMIG) and
Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL), the state-owned power companies serving
their respective states.
2.02        Due to the development of more efficient design criteria and lower-
than-expected unit costs, execution of the project, as measured by actual and
forecast data on numbers of connections, completion dates, cost, etc., was a
success. Notwithstanding the pending question as to the internal economic rate
of return on the project on an ex-post basis (see paras. 5.04-5.05), there would,
under ordinary conditions, probably have been a second Bank-supported RE project
in Brazil, given the successful implementation of this project. But this did not
happen. Indeed, Bank lending for power projects in Brazil declined during the
1980s and then stopped altogether in 1992 -- primarily due to the macroeconomic
and sectoral factors discussed below.



-2-
2.03        Political & Economic Context. To understand the phasing out of Bank
lending for power projects in Brazil, it is important to review briefly the
political and economic circumstances of the 1980s. These circumstances also form
part of the project context. During 1982-1983, when the project was planned, the
military Government faced complex political and economic problems.   On the
political side, the military successfully undertook those steps leading to its
withdrawal from direction of national political life in 1985 (see below). On the
economic side, to stimulate exports and to restore the shaken confidence of
foreign lenders following the debt crisis of 1982, the Government implemented
stabilization policies aimed at reducing aggregate domestic demand via
restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, real exchange-rate depreciation, and
tightened import restrictions.   On balance, these measures achieved their
objectives, thereby laying the basis for an export-led recovery starting in mid-
1984 (see Schedule 2.1 for key economic indicators).
2.04        In 1985, a year after project execution had begun, a civilian
President (Mr. Jose Sarney) took office. That same year, led by booming exports,
the economy grew strongly with the result that Brazil continued to achieve the
external adjustment required by the debt crisis and a resumption of growth. How-
ever, inflation became more entrenched -- 235% in 1985 (after 211% in 1984). The
causes of inflation were the: inability of Brazil to effect the necessary change
in the domestic saving-investment balance required by the contraction in foreign
borrowing; continued recourse to borrowing from the monetary authorities to
finance persistent public sector deficits; and pervasive indexation of the
economy.
2.05       Because Mr. Sarney succeeded to the presidency following the death
of his party's presidential candidate (Mr. Tancredo Neves), his political man-
date, which was weak at the beginning of his Administration, became weaker under
the pressure of events.! To offset his weak mandate and strong opposition in
Congress, the President tried to muster support for anti-inflation programs
entailing minimum or no sacrifices by any major political group. The Cruzado
Plan (February-November 1986) and the Bresser Plan (June-September 1987) included
some forms of price control and deindexation; but they included no significant
fiscal/monetary measures. In 1989, there was one final attempt to control prices
(the "Summer" Plan), but this was not successful. These measures failed with the
result that the economy suffered from "stop-start" growth, high rates of
inflation, large public sector deficits, and problems servicing foreign debt.
2.06       Bank Lending Policy.  The lending policy of the Bank changed in
response to changes in the Government's macroeconomic goals. For example, in
1984-1985, the Bank supported the objective of restoring creditworthiness not
only with conventional project loans, but also with its so-called "Special Action
Program" (SAP), consisting of quick-disbursing, policy-based loans for export
development and agriculture, and other SAP actions including loan increases and
supplements and special account operations.   The SAP successfully raised
disbursements while supporting policy adjustments required by the crisis.
1/ The effort by Congres  to ewrite the Countition involved a continuing uthrea to the political position of President Saay. During the yeah  19S7-1988,
the middle yea of his Administntion, the Congress considered (but thea rejected) proposals for replacing a presidential government with a parlimentary
governnent and reducing the preidential term of office from 5yean to 4. Tle l988 Constitution re-establishd the power of the Congres,s enh  nced the
autonomy of the stAtes and municipalities, reduced the economic power, of the Executive, and reinforced the rights of organized labor.



-3-
2.07        In 1986, with Loan 2720-BR (US$500 million, 1986), an adjustment loan
supporting a plan for sector financial rehabilitation, the Bank endorsed the
Cruzado Plan. The financial targets for sector financial rehabilitation were
designed to be consistent with the price-control approach of the Cruzado Plan
(para. 6.05), i.e., only modest tariff increases in late 1986 followed by higher
tariff levels in 1987 and later years, resulting in a rising return on
remunerable assets of 9.1% by 1989. (It was expected that a second power sector
adjustment loan would be processed in 1987, provided that sector performance in
1986 was satisfactory and provided that there was reason to believe that sector
performance would be consistent with the financial targets for that year.)
2.08        In 1988 and 1989, following the failure of the Bresser plan in 1987,
the Bank saw the Government's major task to be, not GDP growth and improved
creditworthiness, but stabilizing the economy and controlling the growth of
fiscal deficits financed through money creation -- a task made infinitely more
difficult by the weak political position of the President and a host of
complicated economic constraints.   Cognizant of the political and economic
uncertainties facing Brazil and of the implications of different lending levels
for the its risk exposure, the Bank designed a lending strategy based on the
concept of "graduated response" to policy and institutional changes -- that is,
the level of lending would depend on the comprehensiveness and credibility of the
Government's stabilization and adjustment efforts. The Bank intended that its
ESW work focus on providing the basis for dialogue with the Government on the
fiscal side of its stabilization program. This approach continued to prevail
when the project was completed in 1989.

2.09        Besides what was reviewed above, the project context reflected other
elements. Set forth below are the first of these elements -- the level of Bank
lending to the power sector, sector organization, and sector development
objectives. Other elements are discussed in later chapters.



-4 -
2.10        Bank Lending to the Power Sector.  Since 1949, the Bank has made 41
loans totalling about US$3.6 billion to benefit the electric power sector,
including ten loans to ELETROBRAS, amounting to almost US$2.5 billion (Part III,
Table la); three loans to COPEL amounting to US$169.1 million (Part III, Table
lb); and five loans to CEMIG amounting to US$149.2 million (Part III, Table lc).
Counting loans to ELETROBRAS, the proceeds of which were relent to the operating
companies, COPEL and CEMIG have benefitted from four and seven loans,
respectively, amounting to US$273.2 million and US$324.7 million, respectively.
2.11        Through the mid 1970s, the bulk of Bank power lending helped to
finance hydroelectric stations and transmission works constructed in the Southern
and Southeastern regions. From the mid 1970s to 1985, the emphasis shifted to
financing the expansion of transmission and distribution systems nationwide. In
1986, a sector adjustment loan aimed at encouraging financial rehabilitation,
conservation, and environmental/social safeguards (2720-BR, para. 2.07). During
the next three years (1987-9), the Bank and the Government, due to macroeconomic,
tariff, and other factors, failed to agree on the terms of a second sector
adjustment loan. In June 1990, after the Government implemented major tariff
increases, the Board of Executive Directors of the Bank approved an investment
loan in connection with a transmission and conservation project (3227-BR; US$385
million). However, because the loan agreement remained unsigned for almost two
years -- the Government was unwilling for political reasons to raise tariffs to
the levels covenanted for effectiveness -- the Bank withdrew the loan in April
1992.   No  further  lending to support power projects  in Brazil  is under
preparation.
2.12        Sector Organization.   The sector consists of a relatively compact
group of state- and Federally-owned utilities with primary responsibilities for,
respectively, distribution and generation/transmission. Under existing Federal
electricity legislation, the authority of the Federal Government to supervise
sector decision-making, especially with respect to levels for tariffs, borrowing,
and investment expenditure, is paramount.  However, because of a generalized
liquidity crisis -- many state governments are protesting low tariff levels by
authorizing their operating companies not to make payments for debt service owed
ELETROBRAS or electricity purchased from the Federal generating companies and not
to make payments to RENCOR, the mechanism for transferring excess income from the
financially stronger utilities to the financially weaker utilities --   the
structure of the sector is being re-examined.
2.13        Three agencies established the regulatory environment during project
planning and execution (1982-1989): (i) Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia
Eletrica (DNAEE); (ii) ELETROBRAS; and (iii) Secretaria de Controle de Empresas
Estatais/Secretaria de Planejamento (SEST/SEPLAN).   DNAEE and ELETROBRAS are
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Mines and Energy. DNAEE is a regula-
tory body which approves, inter alia, tariff levels and expansion plans; ELETRO-
BRAS is a holding company for Federally-owned power companies with sector-wide
planning and financial functions. SEST/SEPLAN is a planning agency. In 1981,
in connection with its larger macroeconomic strategy, the Government required
that SEST/SEPLAN review and approve tariff increases and planned levels of
investment expenditures by state- and Government-owned enterprises, including
power utilities, to ensure consistency with the larger macroeconomic plan of the
Government.



-5-
2.14        Sector Development Obiectives.  In order to reduce dependence on
imported petroleum and to improve the national balance-of-payments situation, the
Government, following the oil crisis (1974), adopted a national energy policy
which emphasized conservation, rational energy use, and substitution of domestic
energy  resources  for  imported  energy.    This  policy  called  for maximum
exploitation of local primary energy sources, especially hydro and maximum
efficiency of operations by interconnecting and coordinating the generation and
transmission facilities between regions. The national energy policy also called
for the pro-motion of electricity usage through extension of distribution
coverage in urban and rural areas.y The Bank supported the sector development
objectives with loans which, beginning in the mid 1970s, emphasized the financing
of transmission and distribution works.
3. Preparation
3.01        Timetable and Issues.  Bank interest in Brazilian RE problems began
in 1978 with the dispatch of a consultant who recommended: (i) replacing the non-
standard approaches of the various agencies involved in RE with a common national
program under a single government agency; and (ii) restricting subsidized credit
to cover the cost of connections and wiring to only low-income customers, and
replacing the preferential tariffs benefitting rural customers with tariffa for
large customers at least as high as those of urban customers (see Part III, Table
2 for evolution of issues, Table 3 for project timetable, and Table 12 for use
of Bank resources). It was recognized by local power officials and Bank staff
that rural electrification represented a major unmet need.
3.02        With the assistance of Brazilian officials, Bank staff identified the
RE project in July 1982 and carried out appraisal in December 1982. However, it
was not until December 1983, a year later, that the Bank approved the loan.
During this time, a variety of issues -- economic, technical, financial,
organizational -- were resolved. The issue which took the longest to resolve
related to the level of tariffs and the financial performance of the sector.
Post-appraisal missions were dispatched in January 1983 to examine RE technical
and organizational problems and in July 1983 to examine the finances of the
sector and the executing agencies.
3.03        Bank staff found that the Brazilian agencies involved in rural
electrification were not using the same criteria to define an RE project, rank
priority areas for electrification, measure economic benefits, and finance
customer contributions (see para. 3.08 for the criteria used to define the
project).  In addition, Bank staff found that: (i) there was poor coordination
between utilities to ensure that they were carrying out programs consistent with
national priorities; and (ii) financial difficulties constrained the pace of RE
extension.
3.04        To  develop  a  standard  approach  to RE,  the  Bank  conditioned
negotiations to the creation of a Federal Commission to define policies and
regional priorities. The Government complied with this condition. To help the
Commission with its work, the Bank persuaded the Brazilians to include in the

project a study of technical standards, project-design methodology, a medium-term
RE program, and organizational changes among the participants involved with
RE.2'
3.05        The lack of uniform standards for defining and evaluating RE projects
did not mean that the projects were designed without reference to any criteria.
The main criteria used for defining the sub-projects included, inter alia, the
surveyed demand for electrification in rural areas and its relation to the rural
population enjoying electricity service, the size and timing of future benefits,
financing constraints and the amount of customer contribution, and the executing
and monitoring capability of the utility. Selection of areas to include in the
project was based on a ranking coefficient reflecting the total weight of
differently-weighted parameters which aimed at maximizing the socio-economic
impact of RE projects.   The main parameters for selecting the areas to be
included in the project were size of the rural population, number of rural
properties, income from farming and livestock activities, availability of
electric infra-structure, and number of properties already electrified. Because
the differing weights accorded the parameters represented subjective judgements,
how these areas were ranked became a valid question and led immediately to a
second question: should the demand of these areas be met, given the competition
for the scarce resources available to the utility and the country?  In this
manner, the issue of project-design methodology involved fundamental questions
about the economic justification of the project.
3.06        During project preparation, the methodology of economic evaluation
was an important issue, and a number of alternative approaches was considered.
Both CEMIG and COPEL were requested to substantiate the merits of their proposed
subprojects with survey data, as a result of which there were small changes in
project design. In the chapter on economic analysis, the SAR pointed out that
CEMIG and COPEL were carrying out their: (i) generation and transmission programs
in conformity with a least-cost national expansion plan which had been approved
by the Bank; and (ii) RE projects optimized on the basis of: (a) technical
standards chosen through an economic comparison of alternatives; (b) a large
unfilled demand for electricity in rural areas; and (c) ranking of those areas
according to criteria suagesting higher benefit/cost ratios. The SAR did not
assert that the project was least-cost, as this would have been too difficult to
prove.  Further, the SAR did not include an economic rate of return for the
project because of the difficulty of identifying the incremental electricity
sales associated with the project and because of what was expected to be a long,
inconclusive debate associated with quantifying some of the project benefits,
especially the net values of savings due to the substitution of electricity for
petroleum and of increased revenue due to increased agricultural production.
Instead, the SAR justified the project economically, applying the Bank's
traditional approach to electric power project and focusing on the combined
CEMIG-COPEL expansion programs for 1984-1988, which had a projected internal rate
of return of about 9%. The project would include a study of, inter alia, the
technical and economic issues related to project justification.
3.07        Concerning subsidized credit, the Bank and the Government agreed that
it was the responsibility of the customer to finance the cost of his connection

and wiring, but that help would be available from the Central Bank and commercial
banks as required.!y Instead of addressing the issue of preferential tariffs,
the Bank decided to condition loan processing to implementation of a sector-wide
tariff scheme agreed in 1981 -- increasing tariffs in real terms by 3% in 1982
and 5% annually thereafter until the sector earned a return of 10% on remunerable
assets.'  When it became aware that the sector had not met this target, the
Bank, taking a sympathetic attitude toward the problems of Brazil and the efforts
of the Government to resolve those problems, invited the Brazilians to discuss
a new scheme to restore sector finances.Y Just as negotiations for the RE loan
were beginning, the Bank obtained commitment from the Government to a new sector-
wide financial rehabilitation plan -- namely, that through tariff actions and
other measures, the Government would raise the sector rate of return on
remunerable assets by 1% a year from the then current level of 4% until the
sector reached the legal minimum of 10% by 1989.2'  This scheme replaced the
prior tariff scheme; and as long as the Government and the sector were making
progress with respect to its implementation, the Bank agreed not seek to enforce
existing financial covenants, which, based on power-tariff legislation, required
an annual return of 10% on remunerable assets.
3.08        An issue discussed and settled among the Brazilians was the identity
of the borrower. ELETROBRAS would be the borrower and would relend the proceeds
of the loan to COPEL and CEMIG, which would be the executing agents. A loan
agreement defined the obligations of ELETROBRAS; project agreements, the
obligations of COPEL and CEMIG; shareholder agreements, the obligations of the
states of Parana and Minas Gerais, the respective owners of COPEL and CEMIG; and
a guarantee agreement, the obligations of the Federal Government.
3.09        Objectives.  The objectives of the RE facilities were to: increase
agricultural production through irrigation; foster the development of agro-
industries; substitute electricity for oil; and improve living conditions in
rural areas.F' The objective of the study was to resolve certain institutional,
methodological, and policy issues related to RE (para. 3.02) and to assist in the
preparation of a medium-term plan for developing RE.  The objectives of the
training programs corresponded to their different parts: consulting services and
training abroad to ensure that staff remained abreast of state-of-the-art
developments; technological research to define economic standards for RE
projects; and establishing demonstration farms to educate rural customers.
3.10        Description.  Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement defined the project
as consisting of:

distribution transformers with a total installation of about 600 MVA and
related substation capacity; and (2) a training program to include 350
staff-months of fellowships abroad and 105 staff-months of technical
assistance by external consultants for on-the-job training;
Part B (COPEL) -- (1) connection of about 88,400 new consumers in rural
areas and about 55,800 new consumers in small towns and villages in rural
areas through installation of about 46,000 km of distribution lines and
about 69,000 distribution transformers with an aggregate capacity of about
700 MVA and related substation expansion; and (2) a training program,
including about 110 staff months of fellowships abroad and 20 staff months
of technical assistance provided by external consultants for on-the-job
training; and
Part C (ELETROBRAS) -- a study of RE problems -- including a review of and
evaluation of past studies, an analysis of technical aspects, project-
financing policies, tariffs to rural consumers, and the development of a
framework for a medium-term national RE plan.   This study would also
develop a methodology   for the socio-economic review of RE projects,
guidelines for the development and application of electrification
standards, and organizational and institutional changes required for
carrying out such plan.
3.11        Parts A and B provided for the construction of three-phase and two-
phase 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV rural distribution lines and transformers (rural
distribution lines), three phase and single-phase 13.8 kV connection lines and
transformers for farm electrification (rural circuits), and 34.5 kV and 13.8 kV
distribution lines for village electrification (primary feeders). Parts A and
B also provided for the construction of low voltage distribution lines (secondary
feeders), consumer connections, metering equipment, and related auxiliary
equipment required for the appropriate expansion of the capacity of the CEMIG and
COPEL systems.
3.12        Expected Cost. Financing, Procurement. and Timetable.  The expected
cost of the project was USS$584.6 million, including a foreign cost, direct and
indirect, of US$242.8 million, excluding a front-end fee of US$0.6 million. It
was expected that the Bank loan, US$222.8 million, would cover the foreign cost
of: (i) goods and materials (US$215.9 million) procured under International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), except for special teaching equipment (US$2.0 million)
to be procured under Limited International Bidding (LIB); (ii) training,
including fellowships (US$2.1 million) and consultant services (US$2.2 million)
procured under the Bank's guidelines for selecting consultants; and (iii) the
front-end fee (US$0.6 million).   It was expected that the cost of consultant
services amounting to US$0.7 million would reflect the cost of the proposed study
of RE problems. The balance of the foreign cost of the project, US$20.6 million,
was expected to be covered by supplier co-financing and corresponded to the
foreign cost of reserved procurement (with a total cost of US$58.3 million),
which the Bank would not finance. It was expected that the local cost of the
project would be funded by CEMIG (US$64.6 million), COPEL (US$46.9 million), and
rural consumers (US$230.3 million).
3.13        As for the project timetable, the SAR indicated that implementation
of CEMIG and COPEL sub-projects would begin in 1984 and be completed in 1987.



The Loan Agreement indicated a project completion date of December 31, 1989. The
SAR indicated that the first draft of the RE study would be completed by November
1984 and the final report by November 1985.
3.14        Negotiations. Loan Approval & Sianing, and Effectiveness.  Negoti-
ations were completed during the first week of November 1983 without major delay;
the loan documents were approved on December 8, 1983 and signed on December 14,
1983. The loan agreement became effective as scheduled on March 20, 1984.
4.  ImDlementation.
4.01        Cost.  Financing, Prolect Scone. and Timing.   CEMIG and COPEL
collaborated effectively with the Bank to execute efficiently the physical works
of the project. ELETROBRAS successfully monitored the execution of the RE sector
study.   The actual project cost (US$572.2 million) was 2.1% less than the
appraisal forecast (US$584.7 million) (Part III, Table 4). As the proceeds of
Loan 2564-BR covered all of the foreign cost of the project (US$221.4 million,
excluding US$0.5 million for the front-end fee), co-financing was not required.
CEMIG, COPEL, ELETROBRAS and rural customers funded the local cost (US$301.7
million) (Part III, Table 4). Part III, Tables 5, 6a and 6b compares actual and
forecast: project components and implementation periods, disbursement timetables,
and allocations of loan proceeds.
4.02        Comparing actual and forecast project costs is not a fully useful
exercise because of the substantial increase (65%) in the numbers of new
customers (the sum of rural properties, villagers, and low income) over the
levels expected at appraisal -- the result of the easy financing terms provided
by the power companies to rural customers, adoption of more efficient technical
standards and lower unit costs (paras. 4.06). Due to these factors, there were
substantial reductions in connection costs. The actual average connection cost
per rural property was well below the forecast level: CEMIG, US$3,136 vs.
US$5,337; and COPEL, US$1,540 vs. US$2,416 (in current prices). There was a like
reduction with respect to the average connection costs for the village
electrification program of COPEL: US$393 vs. US$649 (in current prices).
4.03        From the beginning of project execution in early 1984, the rural
populations of Parana and Minas Gerais responded with enthusiasm to the RE
programs offered by CEMIG and COPEL -- so much so that by early 1986, with the
agreement of the Bank, COPEL and CEMIG increased the scopes of their respective
sub-projects to increase the numbers of new connections for rural properties,
village residents, and low-income customers.  At that time, it was correctly
anticipated that all of the original goals for new connections would be exceeded
by the appraisal target date of December 1987. CEMIG completed all but a minor
portion of its sub-project in 1989. The minor portion (a few dozen connections)
was carried out by June 1990, by which date CEMIG had connected 92,140 new rural
properties, almost 54% more than expected. COPEL completed its sub-project in
June 1989, by which date it had connected: (i) 122,986 new rural properties, 39%
more than expected; (ii) 117,137 new village customers, 139% more than expected;
and (iii) 40,722 low-income village customers, 499% more than expected (Part III,
Table 5).
4.04        Performance of Supoliers.  Contractors, and Auditors.   With one
exception, CEMIG expressed no dissatisfaction with the performance of its

suppliers, contractors, and consultants in connection with this project.  It
expressed no dissatisfaction with its auditors.   COPEL also expressed no
dissatisfaction with the performance of its suppliers, contractors, consultants
and auditors. Bank opinion parallel that of COPEL and CEMIG.
4.05        Unit Costs & ICB.   The table on the following page shows:  (i)
categories of equipment funded by Loan 2365-BR for each executing agency; and
(ii) representative unit costs, actual and forecast. According to COPEL, the
causes for the lower unit costs varied, but competition among suppliers was a
major factor. For example, for poles, the actual and forecast unit costs were,
respectively, US$48.54 vs. US$72.89.   The lower actual costs resulted from
economies of large-scale fabrication, adequate advanced payments which allowed
suppliers to purchase raw materials with cash at lower prices, and competition
from wooden poles.   For transformers, the lower unit costs (US$211.34 vs.
US$403.84) reflected the impact of economies of large-scale fabrication and
improved production techniques, technological improvements (lighter weight
solutions), and ICB. Economies of scale and ICB applied to the lower unit cost
for insulators (US$3.58 vs. US$4.63). ICB accounted for the lower unit cost of
meters (US$19.02 vs. US$23.75). In the case of aluminum steel core cables, the
lower unit costs (US$1.75/kg vs. 2.05/kg) reflected lower supply costs for
aluminum -- a world-wide phenomenon during project execution.

4.06        COPEL: Trainina Procram and Technical Assistance. COPEL used TJS$l.25
million and US$0.018 million of the proceeds of Loan 2365-BR for, respectively,
its training program and consulting services (technical assistance).  Of the
total loan proceeds applied to training, US$1.15 million covered the personnel
costs for master's degrees, refresher courses, etc., and US$0.10 million covered
the costs of training materials. The main emphasis of the program for master's
degrees was to reinforce the skill levels of personnel at COPEL's research and
development center, which closely followed developments in the areas of high
voltage transmission, insulation, dielectrics, chemistry, etc. The main emphasis
of the consultant services was also in research and development but it included
consultant services in the areas of electronic/ telecommunications systems,
generation/transmission, hydrology, rural electrification, and management. COPEL
was satisfied with the results of the training program and the consultant

4.07        CEMIG: Trainina Proaram and Technical Assistance. CEMIG used US$3.77
million of the proceeds of Loan 2365-BR for training and consultant services
(technical assistance).  The master training plan included training in rural
electrification, training abroad for managers and technicians, consultant
services in occupational safety, and consultant services in management, planning,
organization and information technology. A total of 167 people received training
abroad amounting to 226 staff months at a cost of US$1.81 million as compared
with the appraisal forecast of 354 staff months at a cost of US$2.84 million.
The actual and forecast costs per staff month of training were very close:
US$8,009 and US$8,023.  The actual and forecast costs of consultant services
were, respectively, US$1.09 million and US$1.20 million; data for actual
consultant staff months is not available.  The actual and forecast costs of
materials and equipment for the demonstration farms were US$0.88 million and
US$0.26 million (including all costs for administration, freight, and assembly).
CEMIG was satisfied with the results of its training program.
4.08        ELETROBRAS: RE Sector Study.  ELETROBRAS used just under US$0.70
million of the proceeds of Loan 2365-BR to help finance its RE study. In May
1984, four firms submitted proposals calling for completion of the work in 18
months. Due to delays in selecting the consultant, initial work on the study did
not began until January 1985. By January 1986, the consultant had completed and
sent to the Bank reports covering the: methodology for area selection, economic
evaluation of RE projects, technical standards, and financial resources for rural
electrification.   Subsequently during 1986, reports were prepared on tariff
policies, organization of the sector, a master plan, and monitoring RE programs.
The study established that for the purposes of economic evaluation, it was
possible to calculate a so-called "social" internal rate of return for an RE
project based on the costs of the project and its benefits -- the benefits being
net marginal revenues from the sale of additional electricity to rural customers,
cost savings from the substitution of electricity for petroleum products, and the
net marginal revenue from the sale of additional agricultural production.
4.09        Bank files do not reveal any commentary on the completed study,
notwithstanding a commitment to send its comments to ELETROBRAS.F' The primary
factor accounting for such lack of commentary appears to be the priority accorded
the problem of sector financial deterioration (paras. 6.02-6.07) by Bank staff.
Another factor was staff constraints as a consequence of the Bank reorganization
(1987).   As for the newly created RE unit at ELETROBRAS, Bank staff expressed
dissatisfaction with its organization and capabilities to guide the work of the
consultants and oversee implementation of future RE programs. With respect to

this last criticism, the Bank expected that the sector would continue to be
organized along strongly centralized lines with ELETROBRAS and other Federal
agencies establishing policy guidelines to be followed by the state operating
companies.  As has already been remarked (para. 2.13), the structure of the
sector is under examination.
5. Proiect Results
5.01        Imxpact of Electrification on Rural Properties.  An important feature
of project design was a commitment from the beneficiaries to monitor results
after the works were commissioned to assess expected benefits. COPEL and CEMIG
complied with the covenants (Section 2.06) of their respective Project Agreements
to establish satisfactory monitoring methods to measure the growth in the use of
electricity by rural consumers, the reduction in the use of fuel oil, and gains
in agricultural output and productivity attributable to the project.   Both
companies have completed intermediate monitoring and evaluation, but final
results will not be available until 1983.
5.02        With the help of a local university, CEMIG designed and executed a
three-stage study to evaluate the impact of its RE program: (i) diagnosing the
properties before the introduction of electric power, i.e., establishing a "base
line" from which to measure benefits; (ii) carrying out an intermediary
evaluation of the effects of electric power on the productive process; and (iii)
completing a final evaluation.
5.03        The intermediary evaluation showed that seventy percent (70%) of the
survey group indicated that their main reason for electrifying was to improve
their standard of living through the purchase of refrigerators, television sets,
and other consumer electrical appliances. The evaluation also showed that, as
a result of electrification, the typical rural property: (a) acquired, for
productive purposes, an electric motor, pumping/irrigation equipment, and
choppers and blowers; (b) increased gross average income by about 5%; and (c)
reduced the use of oil by 10% within the overall energy mix (from 86% to 76%) and
increased the use of electricity from 0.4% to 21.3%. According to CEMIG, "...the
data... indicate that.. .this energy contributed to the optimization of the
agricultural results with direct influence in the economy as a whole..."S
5.04        The COPEL study consisted of a system of indicators capable of
identifying alterations in the sample group's living conditions, the substitution
of energy products, and the increase with respect to agricultural production and
productivity.   Fifty-six percent (56%) of the group of rural property owners
sampled by COPEL indicated that their main reason for electrifying was to improve
their standard of living; twenty-three (23%) of the group indicated that their
main reason for electrifying was improving agricultural production.  Data on
changes in the energy mix were not available. "The results obtained from the
this survey do not exactly permit [us] to verify and measure the impact of
electricity on income."11'

5.05        Internal Rate of Return.  Pending the receipt in 1993 of final data
on the results of the subprojects, this report must defer calculating the
economic return of the project. This information may be of key importance in
deciding whether the project should have been executed, and whether similar
projects should be considered in the future.
5.06        At appraisal, the justification for the subprojects was their being
parts of a combined least-cost expansion programs with a projected internal rate
of return of 9%. Based on actual investment costs and actual and expected
operating costs and net marginal revenues, the internal rate of return on the
combined expansion programs was - 10.7% (Part III, Table 7). This low level,
however, reflects the low level of actual tariffs and the high level of labor
costs and does not measure the economic impact of the program or the project.
If the 1988 tariffs levels of CEMIG and COPEL were maintained for subsequent
years -- they were the highest tariff levels in the past five years -- the
internal rate of return would be zero.
6. Financial Performance
6.01        Sector Finances.  The present legal structure of the sector is such
that it is fundamental to analyze sector finances (paras. 6.03-6.07) in order to
interpret adequately the finances of the individual power company (6.09-6.14);
and sector finances reflect the paramount regulatory authority of the Federal
Government.
6.02        After 1978, sector finances deteriorated because the Government,
mainly due to political considerations, allowed tariff levels to decline in real
terms (Part III, Table 8a). The financial difficulties of the power sector were
exacerbated by greater reliance on borrowings and a heavy debt-service burden
(Part III, Table 8b). By late 1981, due to low tariff levels, the sector rate
of return had declined below the legal minimum of 10% established by law, and
most of the Bank's power borrowers were unable to comply with their respective
revenue covenants which were based on Brazilian power-tariff legislation.
6.03        In their initial effort (September 1981) to address the financial
problems of the power sector, the Government and the Bank agreed on a tariff
recovery plan featuring "real" tariff increases of 3% in 1982 and of 5% annually
thereafter until the sector earned a return of 10% on remunerable assets. The
Bank confirmed this agreement by its letter to the Government of December 23,
1981. The letter also provided that the Bank would not enforce the covenants of
previous loans relating to rate of remuneration as long as the Government and the
power companies complied with the plan for sector financial recovery.
6.04        In 1982, because the Government implemented tariff increases at a
slower rate than needed to raise the "real" level as called for under the plan,
the level of the average tariff in "real" terms was about 10% below the level of
1981; and the sector did not cover its debt service (Part III, Tables 8a and 8b).
The plan failed to achieve its objective because political considerations
dominated the thinking of the Government. Also contributing to this result were
defects inherent in the plan, implementation delays, and high levels of
inflation.



- 14 -
6.05        In 1983, the Government and the Bank amended the 1981 plan to reflect
new financial targets and a deferred timetable for financial recovery. When the
sector again did not meet the new targets, the Government and the Bank agreed in
1986 on a third plan of financial recovery which again deferred the timetable for
recovery -- the Power Sector Recovery Plan (PSRP). With Loan 2720-BR (US$500
million; 1986), the Bank supported the PSRP. To be consistent with the price-
control approach of the Cruzado Plan (para. 2.05), the PSRP featured only modest
tariff increases in late 1986. Higher tariff levels were to materialize in 1987
and later years; the sector rate of return on remunerable assets was expected to
rise from 5% in 1986 to 9% in 1989. In August 1987, the Bank and the Government
discontinued their efforts to negotiate a second sector adjustment loan due to
the re-introduction of price controls (Bresser Plan -- para. 2.05), including a
freeze on electricity tariffs. The Bank and the Government renewed their efforts
to negotiate a second sector adjustment loan in 1988 and in 1989 but these
efforts failed due to deteriorating economic conditions and the Government's
choosing strategic objectives other than the financial rehabilitation of the
power sector.   Between 1986 and 1989, the levels for annual average monthly
sector tariff were (in prices of July 1989): 1986, US$42.56/MWh; 1987,
USS52.26/MWh; 1988, USS54.67/MWh; and 1989, US$39.49/MWh .
6.06        During the years 1981-1989, the Bank, noting the difficulty and
complexity of the macroeconomic and political problems of Brazil, felt that it
would be more useful to help the Brazilians to formulate and implement a credible
plan of tariff and financial recovery than to terminate the dialogue by
suspending disbursements or by stopping the processing and approval of new loans.
Accordingly, the Bank, relying on the recovery plans agreed with the Government
in 1981, 1983, and 1986 continued to make investment loans (2138-BR, 2364-5-BR,
etc.) and a sector adjustment loan (2720-BR); and subsequently tried to process
additional sector loans in 1987-89. Notwithstanding their disappointing results,
the plans and the subsequent loan-processing efforts provided a useful vehicle
for dialogue with the Government.
6.07        In June 1990, the Bank renewed its effort to support the sector by
approving Loan 3227-BR to help finance distribution works.   Effectiveness
depended on the Federal Government's raising tariffs to the covenanted level of
USS54/MWh (in prices of July 1989).  By December 1990, the level of average
tariffs had declined from the June 1990 level of about US$43/MWh (in prices of
July 1989) to about US$35/MWh (in prices of July 1989); the annual monthly
average tariff for 1990 was US$40.59/MWh. In 1991, the average monthly level of
tariffs was US$37.70/MWh (in prices of July 1989). As of September 1992, the
level of average tariffs was US$45.40/MWh (in prices of June 1991) and the range
for the year was US$42.41/MWh to US$46.37/MWh (in prices of June 1991).  For
nearly two years, the Government chose not to sign the loan agreement, as it did
not wish to raise tariffs as covenanted.   In April 1992, the Bank,  after
appropriate consultation with the Government, withdrew the loan.
6.08        Financial Performance of CEMIG & COPEL.   CEMIG and COPEL are state-
owned power companies subject to Federal regulation with respect to expansion
planning and levels of tariffs, long-term borrowing, and investment expenditure.
Because of such Federal regulation, their respective financial performances
broadly parallel each other and that of the sector as a whole. However, since
they serve different markets and respond to different local pressures, there were
important differences in their respective financial performances.



-15 -
6.09        CEMIG.   The summarized data set forth in Schedule 6.1 compares
CEMIG's actual and forecast financial performance for the period 1984-1988, the
expected project-execution period. It also shows actual data for 1989 (see Part
III, Tables 9a-9e for other details). Financial data reflect the price level of
December 1983. During the forecast project-execution period, actual levels of
summarized sales, average revenue, and total revenues were higher than expected
-- respectively, 116,725 GWh vs. 108,628 GWh, or + 7.5%; Cr$23.8 vs. Cr$23.1, or
+3.0%; and Cr$2,825.7 vs. Cr$2,509.5 million, or +12.6%. Contributing to the
higher level of sales and revenues was the acquisition of other concessionaires,
including one serving 61 municipalities with a population in excess of one
million. As for summarized sources and applications of funds, CEMIG offset
shortfalls in contributions (Cr$136.5 million) and borrowing (Cr$27.3 million)
with larger-than-expected net internal cash generation (Cr$129.7 million) plus
the short-fall in applications (Cr$34.1 million). During the years 1984-1986,
the equity contributions of the state government amounted to Cr$68.8 million
(US$79.4 million equivalent) -- well below the expected level of Cr$195.2 million
(US$225.4 million equivalent) and below the covenanted level of US$30 million
equivalent annually for the years 1984, 1985, and 1986. The Bank made inquiry
as to whether the state would comply with its obligation but did not threaten to
suspend disbursements for non-compliance.
6.10        Contributing to the higher-than-expected operating performance was
the high proportion of industrial sales (almost 73%), their faster than expected
growth rate (7.3% vs. 5.1%), and the fact that, on average, industrial tariffs
have been higher than tariffs for other customer categories and closer to the
marginal cost of supply. There were also improvements for key financial ratios,
except for the operating ratio and rates of return on remunerable assets.
6.11        Nevertheless, despite the positive operating data, the financial
performance of CEMIG was deteriorating, primarily because of higher-than-expected
levels of staff and personnel expenses (total and average). In 1988, the actual
and forecast levels of average employees were, respectively, 16,190 and 14,419;
and the corresponding ratios of customers to employees were, respectively, 176
and 198. In 1989, the impact of lower average revenue (Cr$20.6 vs. Cr$26.6 in
1988), decreased efficiency (163 customers per employee vs. 176 customers per
employee in 1988), and higher total and average personnel expenses (Cr$251.6
million vs. Cr$204.4 million in 1988; Cr$13,645 vs. Cr$12,626 in 1988) combined
to cause a negative rate of return (-3.9%) on remunerable assets. According to
CEMIG, the increased numbers of staff and the deteriorating efficiency ratio were
due to the acquisition of concessionaires (Part II).
6.12        If, during the years 1984-1988, CEMIG had met the annual target
ratios for customers to employees and not increased the actual average personnel
expense beyond the actual level for 1984, CEMIG would have had cumulative savings
of Cr$205.3 million.  Based on actual annual staff levels and actual average
personnel expenses for the years 1984-1986, if CEMIG had not increased the
average actual personnel expense beyond the level for 1986, cumulative savings
would have amounted to Cr$110.0 million. CEMIG and COPEL both made the point
that there had been no real increase in their basic wages. However, according
to COPEL, the higher average personnel expense was due to social charges and
"premiums" for longevity, increased productivity, etc. (Part II).

6.13        COPEL.  Schedule 6.2 has the same function for COPEL as Schedule 6.1
has for CEMIG -- it compares actual and forecast summarized financial data for
the period 1984-1988, and it also shows actual data for 1989.   During the
forecast project-execution period, higher levels of actual summarized sales
(40,892 GWh, or + 6.4%) offset lower levels of average revenues (Cr$29.6 vs.
Cr$33.0, or - 10.6%) sufficiently to produce actual and forecast revenue levels
which were reasonably close: Cr$1,252.3 million vs. Cr$1298.6, or - 3.5%. The
lower level for average tariffs reflect, in addition to inadequate tariffs for
the sector, the lower proportion of industrial sales to total sales (almost 39%)
as compared with the same ratio for CEMIG (almost 73%). There were improvements
for key financial ratios related to summarized operations, except for the summary
operating ratio and rates of return on remunerable assets.   As for summarized
sources and applications of funds, the larger-than-expected net internal cash
generation (Cr$101.4 million) plus the short-fall in applications (CrS274.0
million) offset shortfalls in contributions (Cr$162.8 million) and borrowing
(Cr$212.6 million).   As for numbers of staff and ratios of customers to
employees, COPEL more than met its targets. In 1988, the actual and forecast
levels of employees were, respectively, 1,725 and 1,822; and the actual and
forecast ratios of customers to employees were, respectively, 183 and 181.
6.14        Despite such positive data, the financial performance of COPEL, like
that of CEMIG, was deteriorating. This situation reflected the impact of lower-
than-expected average revenue and rising personnel expenses (total and average).
If the level of actual average revenue had reached forecast levels, COPEL would
have enjoyed total revenues from the sale of electricity amounting to Cr$1,349.4
million vs. the actual level of Cr$1,205.9 million and net operating income of
CrS606 million vs. the forecast level of Cr$623.9 million--assuming that there
was no change in actual operating expenses.   The average personnel expense
increased from Cr$5,336 to Cr$8,846 (+ 65.8% in real terms) between 1984 and
1988.     According to COPEL,  this increase was due to social charges and
"premiums". Because COPEL was successful in keeping total numbers of personnel
consistent with the target levels for customers to employees, the impact of
rising personnel costs was less than the impact of lower average revenue. For
example, if the average personnel expense had increased at half of its actual
rate of increase (6.7% vs. 13.4%) and if there had been no change with respect
to the actual level of revenues and other operating expenses, COPEL would have
experienced summarized net operating income amounting to Cr$454.3 million as
compared with the actual figure of Cr$409 million (which was 34.5% below the
forecast level). In 1989, the impact of additional decline for average revenue
(CrS27.3 vs. Cr$33.0 in 1988) and higher total and average personnel expenses
(CrS117.3 million vs. Cr$83.5 million in 1988; Cr$12,013 vs. Cr$8,846 in 1988)
combined to cause a negative rate of return (-6.4%) on remunerable assets.
7.0 Performance
7.01        COPEL and CEMIG.  All parties to the project cooperated well.  COPEL
executed its subproject successfully, as did CEMIG. The deteriorating financial
performances of both companies reflected the impact of rising personnel expenses
and Federal tariff policy. The Federal Government established tariff levels; the
state governments established operating policy. Both companies complied with the
major covenants of the Project Agreements (Part III, Tables Ila and llb).

7.02        Bank and Government.  The Bank identified the right technical issues
at appraisal; and negotiated loan documents which were consistent with project
and sector objectives. The Bank played an important role in highlighting the
merits of reviewing RE technical standards on the basis of economic criteria and
requiring ICB for poles based on a formula which allowed comparison between
different materials -- wood, cement, and steel.  Except for the study of RE
problems, the level and extent of Bank supervision was appropriate (Part III,
Tables 12), as the Executing Agencies were technically competent.
7.03        The Bank's involvement with CEMIG and COPEL took place in the wider
context of its continuing dialogue with the Federal Government on addressing
macroeconomic problems (paras. 2.03-2.07) and restoring sector finances (paras.
6.02-6.07).   Between 1981 and 1986, the Bank, taking account of the complex
economic, financial, and political problems of Brazil, made a series of
investment loans and one sector adjustment loan based on the understanding that
the Government would implement three credible plans for rehabilitating sector
finances. The plans failed to achieve their objective because the Government,
due to political considerations plus other factors, did not support the sector
with adequate tariff levels. Between 1987 and 1989, despite strenuous efforts,
the Bank and the Government were unable to agree on terms for new lending due to
tariff, macroeconomic, and other conditions. Between 1987 and 1989, the annual
average monthly tariff level declined from US$52.26/MWh to US$39.48/ MWh (in
prices of July 1989). In 1990, the annual average monthly tariff rose slightly
to US$40.59/MWh and then declined in 1991 to US$37.70/MWh (in prices of July
1989). Given the Government's preference for strategic objectives other than the
financial rehabilitation of the sector, there was very little that the Bank could
do to influence policy.
8. Lessons to be Learned
8.01        The implementation of this project constitutes no cautionary tale.
The lower-than-expected unit costs for materials and equipment demonstrates,
inter alia, the utility of ICB. While final data for calculating the economic
rate of return of the project remains pending, the enthusiastic response of the
rural populations to electrification appears to confirm their perception of its
usefulness in improving their lives. There appears to be a direct link between
their purchase of consumer durables and electrically powered equipment and
improvements with respect to their health, nutrition, and enhanced perception of
options and alternatives.
8.02        On the issue of the financial deterioration of the sector and the
role of the Bank, it seems clear that lending in circumstances of continuing
financial deterioration sends the borrower the wrong message and leads to a
significant risk that agreements for financial rehabilitation will not be
observed. In June 1990, after the Government implemented major tariff increases,
the Executive Directors of the Bank approved a new loan to support a power
transmission and conservation project. Effectiveness and continued disbursement
were conditioned on achieving and maintaining an even higher tariff. In April
1992, the Bank canceled the loan which had remained unsigned almost two years
after approval because of Government unwillingness to raise tariffs to the level
required for effectiveness. This appears to be the right way to maintain the
credibility of the Bank.

Part II: Comments of Executing Aaencies
1.          Concerning Part I, COPEL, which telephoned its comments, limited
itself to one point: the higher level of average personnel expenses was due to
social charges and "premiums" for longevity, increased productivity, higher skill
levels, etc. COPEL emphasized that there had not been a real increase in basic
wages.
2.          By showing the monthly and average annual variations of an index of
the average basic wage between 1984 and 1989, CEMIG made the same point about
basic wages as COPEL. CEMIG made two additional points: (i) the acquisition of
other concessionaires was a major cause of the increase of personnel and the
deterioration of the ratio of customers to employees; and (ii) the Constitution
of 1988 caused no significant increase in the level of average personnel
expenses. The above points have been incorporated into Part I. The comments of
CEMIG are reproduced in full, starting on the following page.

Re (a) above: in conrnction with the institutionat
fre_work of the sector, condition necotiations to prior
receipt of a draft decree creating a FederaL RE
Comission to define policies  nd regional priorities,
and seek sareement at negotiations on an approvat date
for the decree.  To aid the Cofission, the IP
recomended seeking agreement at negotiations for a
consuLtant study on: (i) technical standards; (ii)
project-design methodoLogy; (iii) mediun-term RE program;
(iv) organizs-tional changes at ELETROBRAS and other
partici-pating agencies; and (v) rural tariffs and sub-
sidized credit.
Re (b) above: in stead of seeking action on ruraL
tariffs and subsidized credit, (i) condition further
processing of the loan to immdiate fulfiltment of a
sector-wide tariff agreemnt -- an increase of 3X in real
term  in 1982; ad (ii) seek agreement at negotistions
for utility finencing, as necessary, of customer
contribution.
Re Cc) *bove: increase the loan to USS227 million to
cover all the foreign-currency costs of the project.
Re (d) abov: Lend to ELETROBRAS, which would relend to
COPEL nd CEMIG. CESP withdrew from project.
4. Decision Memorandum                             12/17/82          DM confirmed IP recommendations -- namely, that the Bank
(DM)                                                             should:
Re (a bove: condition negotiations to prior receipt of
decree creating the Federal RE Cmmission.
Re (b) above: condition further processing of the toan
to futfittment of s*ctor-wide tariff agreement. DM
modified IP recommndation re utility financing of
customer contributions to shift focus of such financing
from utitities to banks with utilities to assume onty
residu t financing.
Re (cl bove: raise loan amount to USS250 million.
Re (d) above: no comment.
2. Preparation                                     12/10/82   1.   Mission recommended not including the RE progrm  of
ELETROPAULO in project, given the small size of the
progrm -- it wouLd benfit onty 8,000 customers.

indicated compliance, but audited data later
showed otherwise. In 1987, Bank received no repLy

Under pressure of economic and political events,
Goverrinment chose strategic objectives other
than sector financial rehabilitation via impte-
mentation of tariff increases and other measures.
Hence, sector did not meet target ratios for
return on remunerable assets, contribution to
expansion, debt-service coverage, etc. The
financial performance of COPEL deteriiorated,
because of lower-than-expected tariffs and
because of because of rising personnel expenses,
the result of the enhanced rights of organized
labor under new Constitution.
