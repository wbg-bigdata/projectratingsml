                    ANNEX 1: Proposed Changes
a.          What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

   1. This project paper seeks the approval of the Country Director for restructuring
      the WHSMP2 to align it better with the government's new strategy to rapidly
      reduce maternal and neonatal mortality and support the DOH's scale-up of
      performance-based approaches in general and for women's health in particular.

   2. The project development objective of the WHSMP2 is to assist the government of
      the Philippines in improving women's health by: (i) demonstrating in selected
      sites a sustainable model of delivering cost-effective reproductive health services
      to disadvantaged women; and (ii) establishing support systems to facilitate
      country-wide replication of lessons learned within the framework of its Health
      Sector Reform Agenda. The development objective will be retained.

   3. WHSMP2 project has two components. The first component is the local delivery
      of the integrated WHSM Service Package which will support local governments
      in building up health facilities and health personnel who will deliver integrated
      Women's Health and Safe Motherhood services, with focus on maternal care and
      family planning. With regards to the building up of health facilities, the project
      worked with another Bank project, the Local Government Finance and
      Development project (LOGOFIND), which funded the civil works and equipment
      upgrades in the first two project sites of Sorsogon and Surigao del Sur. The
      project was then expected to finance the civil works and equipment upgrades of
      the batch 2 project sites (i.e. the provinces of Albay, Masbate and Catanduanes).
      Additional project sites can still be added as agreed by the Borrower and the
      Bank.

   4. The first component also financed the establishment and operation of reliable
      and sustainable support systems for the delivery of the WHSM services, including
      systems for drug and contraceptive security, safe blood supply, behavioral change
      interventions through performance-based grants and behavioral change
      communication; and sustainable financing particularly through expansion of
      health insurance or PhilHealth financing. In addition to providing incentives for
      behavioral change, the performance-based grants were also used in expanding
      PhilHealth financing and ensuring drug and contraceptive security.

   5. The second component is building up the national capacity to sustain WHSM
      services by developing capacity in the DOH to create an operating environment
      conducive to LGUs managing and sustaining local delivery of the WHSM
      services and facilitate replication throughout the country. This component


                                           5
   includes crafting of policies and guidelines, building up training capacity, and
   setting up monitoring and evaluation systems.

6. There was a delay in project effectiveness as it only became effective in
   December 28, 2005 after the loan signing in June 30, 2005 due to the difficulties
   in getting municipal LGUs to comply with effectiveness conditions. Project
   implementation was then hampered in 2006 by inadequate budget cover as the
   national budget was re-enacted in 2006 and no specific budget cover had been
   provided for the project in the previous year or 2005 national budget. By 2007,
   the project began to move faster but was then inadvertently delayed by events
   triggered by the project itself when the DOH began to replicate nationally key
   project elements including investing in health facilities and personnel to provide
   EmOC services, the behavioral change communication interventions, the build-up
   of training capacity, and ensuring safe blood supply program.           DOH also
   adopted the performance-based grant concept, although it implemented a different
   approach through its "MNCHN performance-based grants".

7. Although the formal order was only signed in September 9, 2008 (Administrative
   Order 29 series of 2008), the adoption of the project components as national
   policies lead to the DOH decision to closely align the project to this evolving new
   national strategy. As a result, instead of contracting consultancy firms to
   implement work on these areas (i.e. behavioral change communication, HRTD
   and blood supply), as originally planned, the government decided to manage and
   implement these interventions by itself which lead to further delays in project
   implementation and poor disbursements.

8. By the mid-term review in October 2008, it was noted that the adoption of
   Administrative Order 29 series of 2008 has resulted in the mobilization by the
   DOH and other international donors of budget and grant financing for civil works
   and equipment upgrades. This includes grant financing from the Spanish Aid
   Agency for the Bicol region where the 3 new project sites and the original project
   site of Sorsogon are located. With access to either DOH national financing or the
   international donor grants, the batch 2 provinces expressed unwillingness to
   borrow from the sub-project financing component as there is more than adequate
   funding for their respective civil works and equipment upgrades. Currently, all
   three batch 2 provinces and Sorsogon had been provided with both DOH budget
   support and Spanish Aid Agency grants for the civil works and equipment
   upgrades.

9. During the said mid-term review, both the Bank and DOH agreed to the re-
   structuring of the project that will re-align the project more closely with the
   government's strategy including project financing of scaled up implementation of
   behavioral change communication strategies and training capacity upgrading. The
   re-structured project will now drop the sub-project financing component given
   that the civil works and equipment upgrades will be funded from other sources. It
   will continue to implement local level service delivery interventions with the
   focus on performance-based grants that will ensure contraceptive security, expand
   PhilHealth financing, and further incentivize facility deliveries.
                                        6
10. However, the performance-based grants (PBGs) will be improved based on
    ongoing project experience. The PBG for facility deliveries will be expanded so
    that it can incentivize all players involved in increasing facility deliveries
    including the local government units and the health facility management. The
    PBG for PhilHealth SP enrolment will take into account increased enrolment
    estimates. The PBG for contraceptive security will be revamped to be more
    explicit and less cumbersome. The current design of this PBG of a peso for peso
    contraceptive swap has been found not feasible resulting to very low utilizations
    and minimal impact on contraceptive security. The revamped design is more
    realistic and is expected to effectively incentivize contraceptive security. The
    improved PBGs are expected to enrich the understanding and knowledge of the
    DOH in designing and managing performance grants as it slowly shifts to
    performance-based budgets and payments as the primary mechanisms for its fiscal
    transfers to both LGUs and government hospitals and PhilHealth insurance
    payments to health care providers.

11. Unfortunately, the government took over a year to process its re-structuring
    proposal partly brought about by key technical staff needing to work on both
    implementing AO 29 while crafting the restructured design. The government
    finally submitted the request for restructuring this calendar year.

12. As earlier stated, the PDO will be retained but a number of the PDO indicators
    will be fine-tuned to better align with the Government's strategy to reduce
    maternal and newborn mortality. The fine-tuning will also build from the lessons
    gained from the last three years of monitoring the implementation of the project.
    The improved indicators are consistent with the PDO.

13. The restructured design will retain the current project design of one component
    supporting the improvement of local delivery of women's health and safe
    motherhood (WHSM) services in a select number of provinces (part A), and a
    second component building up national capacity to support the local delivery of
    WHSM services all over the country (part B).

14. With the proposed elimination of sub-project financing for LGU-level civil works
    and equipment, project financing for the first component (Part A) will focus on
    the organization and the training of health personnel, and the operationalization of
    support systems for the delivery of WHSM services through performance grants.
    These support systems are the behavioral change towards facility deliveries,
    contraceptive security, and expanded PhilHealth financing. All 1.5 million USD
    originally allocated for the sub-project financing and 200,000 USD from the
    unallocated portion of the loan will re-allocated to the performance-based grants.
    It will now be allocated 5 million USD from the current allocation of 3.3 million
    USD. The increased allocation will finance expansion of the PBGs for facility
    deliveries, increased estimates for the PBGs for LGU enrolment into the
    PhilHealth-Sponsored Program, and the revised and improved PBGs that will
    ensure contraceptive security.

                                         7
15. Consistent with the alignment of the project to the national strategy, the project
    will adopt in the implementation of the PBGs as much as it feasible and
    allowable, the reportorial and other guidelines used by the DOH in governing
    their own MNCHN grants as written in its Department Order no. 311- series of
    2009.

16. Similarly, the project will adopt the more comprehensive approach of AO 29 of
    incorporating newborn care and will now use the basic/comprehensive emergency
    obstetric and newborn care (B/CEmONC) instead of the current
    basic/comprehensive emergency obstetric care (B/CEmOC).

17. The project will continue to finance the pilots of WHSM services that are
    expected to appropriately respond to overseas Filipino workers, sex workers and
    adolescents.

18. The re-alignment of the project to support the national policy will have the re-
    structured second component (Part B) funding the national scale up of
    behavioral change communication interventions which will include media
    advertisements and the national dissemination of mother-baby books. It will also
    finance the upgrading of government training hospitals that will be the main
    providers of training services for health personnel. It will fund the training of
    health workers from all over the country on the delivery of BEmONC, CEmONC
    and other WHSM services. It will support investments on blood supply
    equipment nationally although the project will prioritize support for the 5 project
    provinces. It will continue to finance the development of policies and guidelines
    while ensuring that the monitoring and evaluation systems for both the project and
    the national strategy are strengthened.

19. With all the above changes, the revised project description will be as follows:

           Part A Local Delivery of the Integrated WHSM Service Package

           1.       (a)     Develop and enhance the capacity of LGU Beneficiaries to
           establish and operate a network of providers of the WHSM Service
           Package, including teams for women's health ("WH Team"), basic
           emergency obstetric and newborn care ("BEmONC Team"),
           comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care ("CEmONC
           Team"), sexually transmitted infection team ("STI Team"), adolescent
           and youth health team ("AYH Team"), and itinerant team ("Itinerant
           Team") through the provision of: (i) goods and works for DOH-owned
           facilities; and (ii) consultant services, training and workshops.

                   (b)     In selected pilot sites, assist LGUs in the development and
           implementation of cost-effective and sustainable approaches to reach
           three high risk groups: freelance sex workers, returning overseas workers,
           and young adults.



                                         8
2.      Establish and operate reliable and sustainable support systems for
the delivery of the WHSM Service Package, through:

        2.1 Pilot testing Performance-based Grants to selected LGUs,
health services providers, and users that would ensure:

              (a)    Behavioral change towards facility deliveries
       supported by the enactment of supporting local ordinances and
       dissemination of mother-baby book and other goods and supplies.

               (b) Drug and contraceptive security, that would include the
       (i) the establishment of efficient province- and city-wide logistics
       planning, management and procurement systems; (ii) the
       segmentation of local markets for appropriate targeting of
       subsidized financing and free distribution of contraceptives; and
       (iii) the complementary establishment or expansion of social
       marketing initiatives for contraceptives.

              (c))   Sustainable financing of local WHSM services and
       related commodities through increased LGU financing and
       increased revenues from PhilHealth benefit payments.

        2.2 Safe blood supply, through the provision of goods and services
for the setting up of a network of blood service facilities at different levels
of the health care system to meet anticipated needs for safe blood for
obstetric and other emergencies.

     Part B: National Capacity to Sustain WHSM
                      Services
1.     Develop, adopt and implement operational and regulatory
guidelines for the provision and use of WHSM Services.

2.     Behavior change communication interventions through the
provision of goods and services for advocacy, communications and
information dissemination.

3.     (a) Develop a network of training providers that are accredited to
provide courses on: (i.) appropriate delivery of the integrated WHSM
Service Package; and (ii.) team work and collaboration for the various
types of WHSM teams; and (b) support the training of various WHSM
teams in this network.

4.     (a) Develop a system to monitor and evaluate the implementation
of the WHSM Service Package and publicly disseminate the monitoring
and evaluation results; (b) carry out Project baseline and impact
evaluation studies; and (c) support policy and operations research on
WHSM.
                              9
              5.     Establish and maintain project management capacity at the
              national and at the local level.


   20. The current loan agreement has six performance indicators. It is now proposed
       that we fine-tune the project indicators as written in the loan agreement.

            IUDs for the past 6 months

   21. Indicator number 1 (% of births delivered by skilled attendant or health
       professional at either in facility or at home) is incompatible with the recently
       adopted national strategy of rapidly expanding access to facility deliveries. Given
       that the DOH and the provinces will no longer focus in attaining this indicator, it
       is proposed that this indicator be dropped.

   22. Indicator number 4 (% of deliveries in BEmOCs and CEmOCs financed through
       DOH-LGU performance-based grants) is being proposed to be dropped so that
       the project can focus on getting the facility deliveries financed by PhilHealth for
       this acknowledges that sustained financing will be coming primarily from health
       insurance.

   23. The current description of two of the indicators (indicators number 3 and 6)
       makes it difficult to measure these indicators. Indicator number 3 (% of poor
       whose facility delivery was financed by the Sponsored Program National Health
       Insurance Program (PhilHealth-SP) is difficult to measure since there is still no
       universally accepted listing of poor per LGU in the Philippines. In the absence of
       such listing, this indicator has not been tracked since the start of the project. It is
       therefore proposed that indicator number 3 be slightly modified into measuring
       the % of all deliveries in BEmONCs financed by PhilHeath-SP. This indicator
       will focus on tracking the ideal results of health insurance-financed deliveries at
       the first-level facility of BEnONC. It also measures the sustainability of the
       project interventions



                                             10
    24. Indicator number 6 ("% of rural health units (RHUs) that have not experience
        stock-outs of pills, injectables and IUDs for the past 6 months") is also difficult to
        measures. Health centers/RHUs do not routinely reports stock-outs and the DOH
        does not routinely report this number. Since the project started, there was only
        one year where data was actually collected but this was done with the use of
        provincial health staff going town to town to get the data of which data quality is
        admittedly questionable. Since the intention of this indicator is to measure
        contraceptive security, it is now proposed that the project shift to a less ambitious
        project indicator of "% of LGUs that have passed an ordinance on contraceptive
        self reliance". Although an input indicator, this is a measurable number that can
        provide a picture of the commitment by LGUs to contraceptive security.

    25. In order to improve the monitoring of project performance, slight changes in
        indicators 2 and 5 (i.e percentage of facility deliveries, % of PhilHealth-financed
        deliveries, and contraceptive prevalence rate) is recommended by monitoring and
        tracking these indicators per project LGU basis.

    26.        With the dropping of indicators 1 and 4, the following indicators are now
          proposed to be included as part of the results framework. Two of these indicators
          are from the PAD while the third one is an adaption of the Core Indicators that the
          Bank is now tracking globally across all projects.

    27.       The PAD indicators being proposed for inclusion in the restructured loan
          agreement are (a.) % of the BEmOCs have PHILHEALTH accreditation for its
          maternity care package and (b.) Number of LGUs attaining 75% of their targets
          for LGU enrolment of poor households into the PhilHealth sponsored program.
          However, the indicator on accreditation will be slightly revised to indicate
          BEmONCs and that it will be measured on a project province basis. The indicator
          on LGU enrolment into PhilHealth will be improved into a sustainability indicator
          as follows: "% of project LGUs sustaining their enrolment for the PhilHealth
          Sponsored Program coverage to at least 75% of the city and municipal targets/"

    28.       The Core Indicator being adopted is the indicator "number of health
          personnel trained". This will be slightly revised to "the number of BEmONC
          teams trained" since the project focuses on training and building up health teams
          rather than individual health personnel.

    29. The fine-tuned seven project indicators are now proposed as compared to the
        current indicators are as follows:

      Current Performance Indicators                 Restructured Performance Indicators

If, yes, please explain:


Financing mechanism/Conduit                                    _X_Yes    ___No
If, yes, please explain:

        There is no longer a need for sub-project financing to fund the upgrade of local
government-owned health facilities as the next three project provinces can now access
grant funds from the Spanish Aid Agency and national government budgetary support to
fund the upgrading. Besides the removal of the sub-project financing to the project
provinces, no other changes are planned.

Outputs                                                        X_Yes     ___No
If, yes, please explain:

         The project will no longer fund civil works for the upgrading of health facilities.
All originally planned outputs (i.e. trained health workers, blood supply systems in place,
etc.) are retained.

        The total project costs will be the same with the IBRD component of US$16
million and the borrower's share of US$22 million retained. However, there will be a re-
allocation of the funds across components brought about by the dropping of the sub-
project financing component and the need to finance the scale up of the other
components. There will be an increase of 1.7 million USD in the performance grants
(PBGs) primarily brought about by increased estimates of poor households that needs to
be enrolled into the National Health Insurance Program or PhilHealth, the expansion of
the PBGs for facility deliveries, and the revision and enhancement of the PBGs for
contraceptive security. The current PBGs and the revised and improved PBGs are
attached (Annex 4).

         In addition to the increase for funding PBGs, there will be a 20% increase (4.8
million USD from the current allocation of 4 million USD) for the allocation for goods to
account for the added inputs to the HRTD and BCC. Training and workshops will
decrease by 12% (1.5 million USD from the current allocation of 1.7 million USD) as the
costs of training have decreased with the decision of government to manage the HR
trainings and organize a consortium of government hospitals to be the lead training
institutions. The original and revised allocation is attached (Annex 5).

Financial management                                       ___Yes    _X_No
If, yes, please explain:

       No changes in financial management are expected. Nonetheless, even if there are
no expected changes, financial management assessments were conducted of the batch 2
provinces of Albay, Masbate and Catanduanes. The FM assessment deemed the FM
management of these provinces acceptable for project implementation.

        The FM assessment is attached as Annex 6.

Disbursement arrangements                                  _X_Yes    ___No
If, yes, please explain:

        With the removal of sub-project financing, there is no more need to maintain a
special account with the Department of Finance for Part A of the project. The Department
of Health special account for Parts A and B will be retained.

Procurement                                                ___Yes    _X_No
If, yes, please explain:


Closing date                                               _X_Yes    ___No
If, yes, please explain:

        The closing date will be extended for one year from the current closing date of
June 30, 2012 to the proposed June 30, 2013. This extension is expected to allow the
project to fully implement the delayed project components. This also provides support for
the ongoing implementation of the national strategy or Administrative Order 29 series of
2008.

Implementation schedule                                    _X_Yes    ___No
If, yes, please explain:

        The delayed implementation of the project and the extension of the closing date
for one year will push back the implementation of all project components particularly the
local level implementation in the next batch of project provinces. The PBGs in the first
two provinces are now expected to end by the first quarter of CY 2012 while the PBGs in
the next three project provinces will commence by the third quarter of CY 2010 and are
expected to end by the first quarter of CY 2013.

       The support provided to the scaling up of the national-level implementation of the
BCC, blood supply, and HRTD components will continue until the end of the projects.
The pilots on adolescent health and sexual health workers will commence by the last
quarter of 2010 and are expected to continue up to CY 2013. The mid-term evaluation
survey which was expected to have been done in CY 2009 is now expected to be
contracted and done in CY 2011. The end of project evaluation survey will be initiated
and completed by the CY 2013. The end of project evaluation will include an impact
evaluation of the project interventions.

1.    A financial management assessment of the three provinces (Albay, Catanduanes
     and Masbate) being added as additional project sites were conducted to determine
     their financial management capacity to implement the activities under component
     A of the project. The Component A supports building up of the capacity of a
     select number of provinces to deliver integrated womens' health and safe
     motherhood services by financing goods and works for local government unit
     (LGU)-owned and Department of Health-owned health facilities in these
     provinces; performance based grants; consultant services; and training and
     workshops.

2.    The assessment showed that the financial management systems of the three
     provinces will meet the financial management requirements as stipulated in
     OP/BP10.02 subject to implementation of agreed actions and mitigating measures
     designed under the original project. The assessed financial management risk for
     these provinces before the mitigating measures is considered substantial. The
     factors that put the FM at substantial risk in these provinces are: (i) the disclaimer
     audit report by the Commission on Audit for provinces of Masbate and
     Catanduanes; (ii) the qualified audit opinion for province of Albay; and (ii) the
     lack of experience of the three provinces in Bank's disbursement procedures.

3.    The weaknesses noted in the provinces, among others, are as follows: Masbate ­
     (i) the province failed to conduct physical inventory of its Property, Plant and
     Equipment valued at PhP520.84 million, and (ii) there were unreconciled
     differences in the cash in bank account between ledger and bank statement
     totaling PhP11.65 million; Catanduanes ­ (i) the province did not conduct
     physical count of its inventories and property, plant and equipment and was
     unable to provide proof of land ownership, (ii) inadequate documentation on some
     receivable accounts and non-preparation of updated bank reconciliation
     statements; and Albay ­ the province failed to complete the conduct of physical
     inventory of all its supplies and property and submitted only a partial report of
     property, plant and equipment, thus, actual existence, and validity of the recorded
     cost of inventories and property valued in the books at PhP746.15 million and
     Php52.89 million, respectively, could not be ascertained.

4.    The FM risk for the three provinces could be reduced to an acceptable level after
     the mitigating measures designed under the original project enumerated below are
     implemented and have shown effective impact. The financial management
     arrangement and mitigating measures shall include the following, among others:
      a. Maintenance of an adequate financial management system with appropriate
          books of accounts and in accordance with generally accepted accounting
          principles;
      b. Maintenance of separate project bank account for the loan proceeds;

                                          20
        c. Annual audits of the project financial reports of the beneficiary provincial
           Local Government Units (LGUs) by their respective Commission on Audit
           (COA);
        d. Training of the financial management staff of the provincial LGUs;
        e. Submission by provincial LGUs to DOH of an operation and maintenance
           plan for the duration of the project and establishment of a special fund for the
           operations and maintenance of the facilities and equipment; and
        f. DOH will continue to handle the overall financial management arrangement
           for the Project.

   5.    DOH is currently implementing three Bank-assisted projects, which include this
        Project, the National Sector Support for Health Reform Project (NSSHRP), and
        the EC Grant, and in the past had implemented other Bank-assisted projects. The
        FM implementation support reviews conducted by the Bank in April and May
        2009 concluded that the implementation of the FM arrangements under NSSHRP
        and WHSMP2 were Moderately Satisfactory and Moderately Unsatisfactory,
        respectively. The significant issue that affects the adequate implementation of the
        FM arrangements under the existing Bank-assisted projects is the inadequate FM
        staff at DOH Central Office (CO). DOH has had delays in submitting the
        required financial reports and although it had been addressing these delays, it
        must ensure that delays will not happen in the future. This would require more
        intense supervision by the DOH project management over all the Bank-assisted
        projects. The Commission on Audit (COA) rendered a qualified opinion on the
        2008 project financial statement for WHSMP and clean opinions on NSSHRP and
        EC Trust Fund. As of February 1, 2010, DOH has no outstanding audit reports.

   6.    FM Action Plan ­ Following are the actions that DOH should undertake to bring
        the FM of the project to Satisfactory level:
