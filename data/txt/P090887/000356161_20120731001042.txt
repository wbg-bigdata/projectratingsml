1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Driven by the oil boom, Azerbaijan’s per capita income rose from a post-
independence low of US$470 in 1995 to US$1,240 in 2005. The country had achieved
macroeconomic stability over the years prior to appraisal, and the increasing oil and gas
revenues provided significant prospects for further GDP growth. The Government of
Azerbaijan (GOA), however, also faced a major challenge in terms of using its oil
revenues to stimulate sustainable and broad-based growth to generate jobs, equity and
reduce poverty. Ensuring non-oil sector growth, and, in particular, preventing the loss of
competitiveness of the agricultural sector, which employed about 45 percent of the
workforce, and enhancing rural sector growth were seen as critical to enhancing food
security and providing opportunities for expanding incomes of Azerbaijan’s poor.

2.      Agriculture accounted for approximately 12.3% of GDP in 2004, and was the third
largest economic sector after oil and construction. In addition, agro-industry, including
textiles, represented over 50 percent of total manufacturing employment. Agriculture was
also an important source of income and stability for rural areas where the benefits of the
country’s petroleum wealth were much less evident. Further, the share of expenditures on
food by Azerbaijani households was high (75%), and even higher for the rural poor (81%).
While rural households produced half of their food consumption, the reliance on own
consumption was even higher (65%) for the poorest households (PAD, June 2006).

3.       The State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development (SPPRED)
of 2003 articulated the Government’s strategy to promote more balanced, private sector-
led growth and reduce poverty. Against this background, in 1998, GoA requested World
Bank support for agriculture, through a multi-phase Adaptable Program Lending (APL)
instrument to address the medium-term development goals of the rural sector. The first
phase, ADCP-I (1999-2006, US$30 million), sought to raise agricultural productivity by
consolidating land reform, agricultural extension, and credit elements of the Bank’s Farm
Privatization Project (FPP, 1997) covering a wider geographic area. ADCP-II was to build
on ADCP-I’s achievements, and strengthen the credit union system, expand the outreach
of rural advisory services, improve access to adapted technologies, and fill the gap
between rural producers and higher-end markets by assisting value-added business
activities. ADCP-II was approved on June 27, 2006 and became effective on December
29, 2006.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.     The overall development objective of the three-phase Program as a whole was to
return Azerbaijan’s farming areas to former levels of productivity under a new system
characterized by private family and group farms operating in private markets. Within this
Program objective, the PDO of ADCP-II was to further increase rural productivity and
incomes by enhancing the access of farmers and small and medium rural enterprises to



                                            1
rural business and agricultural support services including financial, advisory and
veterinary services and by stimulating market-oriented investments in rural areas. The
project was to build on ADCP-1’s achievements by: (i) strengthening the credit union
system established under ADCP-I and stimulating commercial financial services suited for
agricultural businesses; (ii) expanding the outreach of the rural advisory services
established under ADCP-I; (iii) developing private veterinary services and modernizing
and streamlining the State Veterinary Services; (iv) improving access to adapted
technologies by one or possibly two selected agricultural research institutes; and (v)
assisting producers and processors in marketing and improved product quality.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

     (i)    Incomes of participating farmers and rural entrepreneurs increased by 20%
            through improved access to services and through vertical integration; and
     (ii)   Production marketed for cash increased by 20% as a result of increased
            quantity and improved quality of production.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification. Not Applicable.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

5.      The primary project beneficiaries were expected to be individual farmers, farmer
groups, rural micro-entrepreneurs, and the small to medium agro-processors. Secondary
beneficiaries anticipated to benefit included: participating financial institutions (PFIs),
through improved skills and a diverse menu of suitably adapted financial products and
services, and the Credit Union network; the national network of advisory services, through
training and technical support; the State Veterinary Service, through strengthened capacity
for disease diagnosis; the National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry and Crop
Diversification (NRICH) and its experimental stations, through modernization and
reforms.

1.5 Original Components

6.      Component 1: Agricultural Business Services (US$42.1m) sought to support
rural businesses to improve the linkages between their production and markets, and to
enhance access to financial services by small and medium rural enterprises (including
farmers), agro-processors, and other forms of agribusinesses, through: (a) capacity
building in PFIs in order to improve their staffs lending skills and to promote new
financial products; and (b) providing badly needed funds for lending to their clients.
Component 1 included four sub-components:          (i) Financial Services for Small
Agribusiness/Credit Unions; (ii) Financial Services for Medium Agribusinesses/Banks
and Leasing Companies; (iii) Development of Efficient Rural Market Links; and (iv)
Rural Business Advisory and Market Service.

7.     Component 2 - Agricultural Support Services (US$14.33m) aimed to enable
farmers to improve their productivity and quality of production by expanding the outreach



                                            2
of the advisory system, strengthening the provision of private veterinary services, and
improving access to adapted technologies. It included three sub-components: (i)
Information and Advisory Services (IAS), to build on the foundations established under
ADCP-I and further develop the advisory system to cover a wider geographical area using
a similar approach; (ii) Veterinary Services, to enhance access to quality veterinary
services throughout the country by expanding and strengthening the private Veterinary
Field Unit (VFU) system, supporting the privatization of the State Veterinary Service
(SVS) field services staff, strengthening the disease surveillance and preparedness systems,
and implementing an agreed control program against at least two priority diseases; and
(iii) Improved Access to Adapted Technologies, where ADCP-II was to build on the
experience gained under ADCP-I and provide one or two selected research institutes to
improve their capacity to develop and demonstrate adapted technologies, focusing on
variety improvement and crop husbandry.

8.      Component 3 - Project Management (US$1.28m) sought to support the
establishment and operation of a Project Management Unit (PMU) under the Ministry o f
Agriculture and to build on the structures established under ADCP-I.

1.6 Revised Components. Not Applicable.

1.7 Other significant changes

9.       Reallocation of Funds and Extension of Closing Date. ADCP-II was
restructured on September 6, 2010 (based on a review in March 2010 of the financial
status of project components) to ensure sufficient funding for the remaining activities.
Rapidly rising prices had resulted in increasing costs for most IAS sub-component
activities and project operation costs and necessitated reallocation of additional funds to
these categories. 1

10.      The project was restructured again in May 30, 2011 in response to a request from
GOA to: (i) extend the project closing date from May 31, 2011 to February 29, 2012, to
complete remaining project activities; and to (ii) reallocate funds to support agreed
activities and ensure the most effective use of undisbursed credit funds under the proposed
extension. In particular, the reallocation was to continue funding the pilot brucellosis
program and develop the animal disease information system, provide additional TA for
specialized studies on seeds and food safety standards, and develop and expand private
veterinary services. The extension was also to allow building into the project as many
activities as possible to help prepare for ADCP-III. 2

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

11.      Project preparation activities to underpin ADCP-II commenced during ADCP-I,
and integrated experiences from the first phase. For example, the Competitive Grants
Program (CGP) established under ADCP-I had helped to instill a famer-oriented and
problem-specific approach to promoting agricultural technology, and this was further
improved, with strong support from Government. ADCP-II also planned to expand
activities based on the positive experiences of private sector participation under ADCP-I.
GoA expressed strong commitment and ownership, and participated actively in project
preparation and design of Phase II. For example, at the Government’s urging, ADCP-II
shifted the CGS sub-component from the research institute-focused grant program to a
more market-led and demand-driven program to address requests from various rural
business enterprises and thus emphasize constraints identified by beneficiaries. GoA’s
commitment is also demonstrated by its contribution of approximately US$9 million for
completing the rehabilitation of the National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry and
Crop Diversification (NRICH) main building and its regional facilities (in addition to
ADCP-II funds for limited essential upgrading of NRICH labs).

12.      ADCP-II incorporated several key lessons in its design, from ADCP-I and other
donor activities in Azerbaijan and the region. These were: (i) the need to promote a wider
outreach and to enhance the capacity of participating financial institutions (PFIs) and offer
a greater range of financial instruments; (ii) the need to strengthen the linkages between
producers and processors, as weak links remained an impediment to agricultural growth;
(iii) that while advisory services offered under ADCP-I had led to a strong impact on
productivity and incomes, it was necessary to create a sustainable national network with
an increased focus on business development; (iv) that farmers were willing to pay for
private services, as indicated in previous experience, but that private veterinary services
needed more income-generating opportunities in order to become self-sufficient; and (v)
that while the CGS generated high interest, the functional linkages between the research
and advisory systems and with producers and rural entrepreneurs needed to be better
defined and improved.

13.     The project’s design included surveys to measure outcomes, which were
undoubtedly useful, especially in assessing less quantitative outcomes such as farmer
views on the benefits from different components. The design also considered the potential
project risks and introduced mechanisms to mitigate their effects. Country-level inherent
risks were considered high, while the project-level control risk was considered moderate.
The project level control risk mitigation measures included the separate FM arrangements
under the project; the use of external auditors acceptable to the Bank; and establishment of
internal control system.

14.     The Market Information and Commercial Hub (MICH) activities could have been
better thought through. It seems at appraisal neither the Bank nor the client had much
experience nor was well informed on the costs of setting up such a system. The estimated



                                             4
budget for MICH quite insufficient and became an issue, which delayed implementation
and resulted in a scale down of planned MICH activities.

2.2 Implementation

15.     Overall, ADCP-II experienced a smooth start up, except in a few areas, where
bottlenecks delayed progress towards laying the ground for good implementation.

16.    The Ministry of Finance (MoF) signed the new Agency Agreement governing the
Credit Union Funds after long delays, and with extensive changes to the Agreement,
which deviated from the draft agreed to by all parties. The project team worked closely
with MoF to overcome this issue and amend the signed Agreement. This delayed activities
under the rural finance part of the Agricultural Business Service component, which finally
got underway in early 2008.

17.    MoF also delayed in approving the Rural Investment Guidelines (RIG) and
subsidiary loan agreements under the Credit line for agribusiness, stalling the start of this
sub-component. The PMU worked closely with MoF to finalize the guidelines and
disbursements finally commenced in May 2008.

18.     Establishment of the MICH was severely delayed, and affected implementation.
The first procurement round failed (due to the financial proposal being far in excess of the
amount budgeted for this activity) and MICH activities had to be scaled down. Eventually,
a local company was contracted in July 2009. Overall, start-up activities to test
approaches and methodologies before a full-scale commissioning of MICH commenced
only in mid-2010, almost three and a half years into project implementation. The MICH
has also experienced problems with respect to price collection, due to the insufficient
quality of training initially provided to price collectors in 2010.

19.     The Veterinary Services sub-component experienced several problems that
resulted in an unsatisfactory rating at the beginning of the project implementation. The
main issue was the lack of commitment to follow the ADCP-II Implementation Manual
(IM) for the PVU sub-component. The selection of veterinarians and contract procedures
diverged from the IM. The market survey was also inadequate, leading to some mis-
interpretation and was subsequently modified. An action plan was prepared to improve
performance and this was mostly completed by the mission in August 2007, and the rating
was upgraded. As a result the project adopted a more sustainable approach to supporting
PVUs with steep reductions in financial support over time and, by the end of the project,
resulting in self-sufficient operations in all but one of the PVUs. This approach is being
subsequently adopted by other projects and modified accordingly based on ADCP
experience.

20.     At the MTR, the newly-established licensing fees for private veterinary practice
and drug production were seen as seriously undermining the project’s efforts to establish
private veterinary services, as the fees were high and prohibitive for developing the
private sector. Although the Bank’s mission had raised this issue with Government, it was



                                             5
not resolved. The licensing fees and the reported subsequent harassment from tax
authorities’ restricted operation of the PVUs supported by the program and was becoming
a significant risk to their sustainability. The mission discussed the licensing issue with the
MoA and subsequently with the SVS and the Agribusiness Department of the Cabinet of
Ministers, and gave serious consideration to suspending the component. The Bank finally
took up this issue with the Prime Minister’s office to resolve it. The Presidential Decree
about the fees was amended and fees were reduced to acceptable levels--from AZN 3000
to AZN 150 for private veterinary activities and from AZN 2000 to AZN 220 for drug sale.
This was a significant commitment on the part of the Government to support the
sustainability of the PVU activities through policy reforms.

21.    The MTR identified certain shortcomings in the implementation of environmental
safeguards. An action plan was agreed on and implemented to remedy the problems (see
Section 2.4 below).

22.     The poor and deteriorating quality of Credit Union (CU) lending portfolio put a
severe strain on the profitability of the Credit Implementing Agency (CIA) and on the
CUs, and affected the implementation of the small agribusiness/CU sub-component.
While most CUs were performing well, a small group of CUs demonstrated weak
governance, and the repayment rate of this group (with two CUs accounting for more than
a half of bad loans) remained a concern. CIA’s CU portfolio as risk (30 days) increased
from AZN 0.19 million in December 2009 to AZN 1, 86 million in September 2011.
Although the project satisfactorily met the target intermediate outcome indicator of over
95% financial recovery rate, by achieving an overall financial recovery rate of 97.42% as
of September 30, 2011, CIA management needs to improve loan underwriting and
collections in order not to jeopardize its future. Further institutional training of CUs is
also needed, as governance continues to be an issue in some CUs.

23.    Factors that contributed to successful implementation include: (i) the familiarity of
PMU members with Bank agriculture projects in Azerbaijan (see Section 2.4 on Financial
Management); and (ii) the flexibility shown by Government and the Bank in responding to
emerging needs and in reallocating funds accordingly within the project’s objectives and
scope, i.e. project support to the computerized National Animal Disease Information
System (AZVET) established initially under the Avian Influenza project and now
operational in all regions, and project activities in upgrading the veterinary faculty of the
Ganja Agriculture University through involving students in the pilot brucellosis program
and project supported training activities.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

24.     The project’s M&E system was well-designed. The Results Framework was
comprehensive and included relevant indicators to capture the project’s activities under
each component. The reporting formats for each component and sub-component were
based on the annual performance targets and monitoring indicators as shown in Annex 3
of the PAD. The design did not include triggers for the next phase of ADCP (APL III).
The design included outcome evaluation surveys, which were a strong aspect. The



                                              6
Baseline Survey, 2006 (BLS); the Interim Survey, 2008 (IS); and the final Completion
Evaluation Survey 2011 (CES) were well done, and the IS and CES used a similar
questionnaire to the BLS, collected information on the same impact indicators, and
covered most (88.5%) of the same groups and households.

25.     The M&E system achieved considerable results. The PMU provided regular
monitoring of project implementation, and the quarterly Progress Reports clearly reflected
the status of implementation based on the performance indicators under each component.
This information was utilized to both track progress and problems and served as a useful
management tool, for example, in tracking changes in loan portfolio quality ratios of CIA,
drafting relevant training materials for CUs, in assessing the demand for project-
sponsored veterinary services and why some farmers did not avail themselves to these
services, farmer satisfaction levels, and on how to expand the brucellosis program. The
CES, which covered five regions where project activities commenced in 2006/07 and
three regions where project activities started in 2008/09, should now serve as a baseline
for continued project activities under ADCP-III.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

26.     ADCP-II was assigned an environmental category Financial Intermediary (FI). To
ensure that the project met the Bank’s environmental safeguard policies (OP4.01), an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and disclosed in April 2006, prior
to the project appraisal.

27.      At the MTR, implementation of environmental safeguards showed key
shortcomings. Due to inconsistencies between the Rural Investment Guidelines (RIG) and
the EMP, many agribusiness sub-projects financed through the participating commercial
banks were under-categorized, and consequently, were not properly treated in terms of
environmental impact mitigation. Operational manuals for operating the CGS and lending
to CUs had only very brief reference to management of environmental impacts and missed
references to the EMP and environmental management regulations to be applied. The
Bank downgraded Environmental Safeguards to moderately unsatisfactory at the MTR
and agreed on an action plan with the PMU to improve the environmental management
system. Actions to be taken included: amendments to EMP to provide a clearer
determination of sub-projects categories; amendments to the environmental section of the
RIG to bring it in line with the EMP; the preparation of sample sub-project EMPs for the
activities typically financed under the credit line to medium agribusiness in order to
strengthen the capacity of PFIs in environmental screening and monitoring of sub-
projects; and more close on-site monitoring of selected sub-projects financed through both
bank credits, CUs, BGs and Competitive Grant Scheme, to be undertaken by the PMU
Environmental Specialist. These actions were completed following the MTR.

28.     The final mission in March 2011 found that the environmental management and
monitoring system for the credit line to medium agribusinesses was fully operational, and
the revised RIGs were being followed. The PMU environmental specialist was also
assisting PFIs and applicants throughout the cycle of implementing sub-projects. Under



                                            7
the CGS and the credit lines to CUs and BGs, environmental management was proceeding
satisfactorily. Environmental management capacity of PFIs, CIA and CGS has been
enforced by a series of training sessions delivered in 2009-2011. No major issues were
reported as a result of monitoring visits.

29.     Financial Management (FM). ADCP-II’s financial management system remained
satisfactory throughout implementation. The PMU already had the experience and
capacity to implement ADCP-II, having implemented ADCP-I. FM staff of the PMU had
also received training. The PMU maintained accurate accounting records of the project,
and quarterly IFRs and annual audit reports were timely submitted and acceptable to the
Bank.

30.     Procurement. Procurement has been carried out in compliance with the Bank’s
procedures. At the beginning, there was a case of mishandling of procurement rules in
relation to the IAS sub-component (as the PMU signed contracts without the Bank’s no
objection) but this was resolved. The procurement specialist was well acquainted with the
World Bank’s procurement procedures. The project carried out three post review
missions. No major issues were identified.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.    As foreseen in the PAD, a follow-on project, ADCP-III is being prepared as a third
phase of APL, and will build on the lessons learned during implementation of the current
phase of ADCP and the substantial progress made to date under the ADCP-II. The project
is expected to: support the development of market-driven agri-food value chains; continue
the process of expanding financial services for rural enterprises through commercial
banks; and scale up the privatization of veterinary services while continuing to upgrade
and modernize the State Veterinary Service to support public health functions. The project
would also contribute to improving the regulatory and institutional basis for food quality
and safety systems.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

32.    ADCP-II’s objectives are relevant to GOA’s “State Program on Poverty Reduction
and Sustainable Development 2006-15? (SPPRSD), which sets out a vision where oil and
gas would continue to play a critical role but would be accompanied by growth and
income-generating opportunities in the non-oil sector. SPPRSD views agriculture as vital
to food security and increasing employment and trade. ADCP-II is also consistent with
the joint IDA/IBRD/IFC Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Azerbaijan (FY11-
FY14), which emphasizes fostering a competitive non-oil sector.

33.    ADCP-II’s components were clearly linked and relevant to the PDO. Although the
multi-activity approach led to a complex design and called for intensive supervision, these
interventions were essential for building on activities initiated during ADCP-I to establish



                                             8
new market relations for emerging small farmers and rural entrepreneurs following the
comprehensive privatization and reform process. Project activities were also well-linked
in terms of their implementation. For example, while advisory and extension services
under Component 2 provided vital access for farmers to knowledge and technology in
order to make informed investment decisions, the first Component increased the
availability of rural financial services to farmers and small entrepreneurs for working
capital requirements, and long-term credit for investment purposes.

34.     The three-phase APL or incremental approach with flexibility to support long-term
development goals also reduces risk and raises the likelihood of successful outcome, as
later projects can be designed based on lessons and results from earlier phases.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

35.      Achievement of the PDO is rated as satisfactory. The two outcome indicators
listed in Section 1.2 and below were well defined and reflected the project’s PDO.

36.     Three surveys were conducted to measure the project’s achievements (see Section
2.3). The CES was conducted in the first quarter of 2011 and covered economic indicators
and productivity for 2010. About 88.5% of the respondents were involved in all three
surveys. The sample consisted of three main groups: ADCP-II groups and two control
groups (flow-on effects--FOE, and external environment effects--EEE). The CES results
are reported separately for five regions where ADCP-II activities started in 2006/07, and
for three regions, where ADCP-II activities started only in late 2008-09. In the three
regions, where project activities started in late 2008-2009, a survey was also conducted in
2008, which can be considered its baseline. Since the timeframe for fully measuring the
impact of ADCP-II activities in these three regions is not sufficient, the achievement of
the overall PDO is judged mainly by outcomes achieved in the five original regions. 3
However, the results of this 2008 survey for the two PDO outcome indicators are also
reported below (i.e. progress from late 2008-09 to end-2010). Details of outputs by
component that helped to achieve the PDO are presented in Annex 2.

PDO Outcome #1: Incomes of participating farmers and rural entrepreneurs increased
by 20% through improved access to services and through vertical integration.

Increase in incomes
     •     In the five original regions, the net (mean) income from general agricultural
           activities of farmers who participated in ADCP-II activities increased from
           AZN (manats) 3211 in 2006 to 3518 AZN in 2008 and to 4481 in 2010. This
           represents a 27.3% increase from 2008 to 2010, and a 39.5% increase in 2010

  The CES methodology is described in Annex 5 and in the respective reports. See ‘Outcomes of
Completion Evaluation Survey 2011’ (Masalli, Makhchivan, Ganja, Sheki and Beylagan), and ‘Outcomes of
Completion Evaluation Survey (for 2008 to 2011) -- Salyan, Goychay, Khachmaz’, Azerbaijan Republic

            over the base year (Table 1). In terms of total income from agricultural
            activities of all respondents, this increased from AZN 2904991 in 2006 to
            3333700 in 2008 and to 3724392 in 2010, representing an increase of 28.2%
            from 2006 to 2010.

     •      In the three regions where activities started in late 2008-09, the total income
            from agricultural activities of ADCP-II groups increased from AZN 985944 in
            2008 to 1150952 in 2010 (represending a 17.7% increase over two years)
            while the incomes of FOE/EEE groups increased from AZN 144311 in 2008 to
            153930 in 2010 (a 6.6% increase).

     •      As a result of access to finance, the average income of the sub-borrowers who
            borrowed from the ADCP-II Credit Line has doubled, from AZN 50-
            60 thousand before the financing, to AZN 100-150 thousand.

37.     With respect to profit-making activities, 62.8 % of the CES respondents derived
profits only from private farming activities (compared to 50% in 2006 and 58.3% in 2008).

38.     The CES highlights significant improvements in access to services (including
advisory, veterinary and financial services) and market-oriented investments that
contributed to the increases in production and income. These include in the use of
individual and group services of Private Advisors (PAs) and RACs in project areas,
greater opportunities to invest in inputs, equipment, processing facilities etc. as a result of
services of CUs, the availability of high-quality seeds, and in utilizing marketing channels
for output sales. Activities under Component 2 aimed to help farmers to increase their
productivity and quality of production by expanding the outreach of the advisory system,
provision of private veterinary services, and improving access to adapted technologies.
The project provided training to Private Advisors (PAs) and Regional Advisory Centers
(RACs) who were then expected to then extend the information and advisory services to
farmers. The project also worked with PVUs established under ADCP-I and established
30 new PVUs.

39.    Improved access to Advisory Services: Of the CES respondents, 93.5% indicated
having used individual services of ADCP-II while 92.8% had derived benefits from group


                                               10
services. With respect to farmer satisfaction with the different components of services, the
majority of respondents who received advisory services provided by the project noted that
they were either satisfied or highly satisfied. Farmers reported impressive increases in
agricultural production as a result of PA/RAC services, with 22%, 55% and 2.7% of
respondents indicating increases of between 1-10%, 10-25% and greater than 25%
respectively compared to 2006.

40.    Improved access to Veterinary Services: With respect to Private Veterinary
Services (PVS), 85.8% of farmers had used PVS. The majority of the 14.2% who did not
use the opportunities of PVS stated that they had no need for the services. Farmers who
used the PVS reported satisfaction and productivity increases, with 36.3%, 26.1% and
10.3% of farmers indicating production increases of between 1-10%, 10-25% and greater
than 25% respectively compared to 2006. The State Veterinary Service has now
requested that the PVU program be scaled up country-wide and to incorporate 800
additional veterinarians to provide better animal health services to farmers and as a means
to promote reduction in the salaried veterinary field staff at the village level as has been
recommended in several project reports and the OIE evaluation of the veterinary services.

41.     The Brucellosis Control program was implemented as a demonstration of the
practical application of the operational aspects of the national disease surveillance and
control programs which were being promoted under the project in close collaboration with
the Avian Influenza Project and other donor projects. Through the program the project
supported vaccination for a total of 490,000 sheep and goats. Other outputs included the
procurement of more than 4 million doses of Rev 1 for the national control program.
According to the census data, 5.1 million ewes and an expected 1.5 million immature
females were eligible for vaccination in 2011. The abortion rate, which was selected as a
proxy indicator for the evaluating the results of vaccination program, decreased by 60-
70%. It can be safely assumed that this contributed to the increase in livestock assets of
farmers discussed below and would lead to a reduction of the incidence of human
brucellosis, a significant benefit of the program. The program has now been adopted by
the Government to be scaled up country-wide.

42.     The project, in cooperation with the Avian Influenza Project, also supported the
establishment of the National Animal Disease Information System which was evaluated in
the brucellosis pilot regions and has been subsequently scaled up country-wide with
project support. This was an unexpected outcome of the project.

43.     Improved access to Adapted Technologies: The project also provided better
access to adapted technologies by modernizing and reforming NRICH, as described in
Annex 2, including its research plans to suit the needs of farmers. The collaborative
demonstration program between NRICH and RACs has been very successful in
transferring new technologies to farmers. In the 2010/11 cropping season, 37 on-farm
demonstrations were conducted by the Institute and RACs in 30 villages of 22 regions to
show the performance of new varieties, efficient agronomic practices, water-saving
technologies, conservation agriculture with wheat, barley, maize, chickpea and lentil both




                                            11
under irrigated and rain-fed farming systems. Field days were also conducted for farmer
groups.

44.     NRICH’s production of super-elite and elite seeds is presented in Annex 2.
Overall, the distribution of these seeds to seed growers, and on-farm demonstration of
technologies has led to significant yield increases. Even in 2010, which was unfavorable
for crop production, wheat in 40 farmer fields gave a yield of 3.5 ton/ha, while the yield of
progressive farmers near the demonstration plots was only 2.1 ton per hectare. The use of
new varieties and production technologies increased profitability by 43.2%. On-farm
demonstration of new chickpea variety “Narmin? was organized in 5 farms of 5 regions.
Cultivation of this variety by farmers has enabled them to harvest 0.3 ton more yield per
hectare and increase their profits by 31.5%. Overall, the seeds of new varieties of wheat,
barley, maize, chickpea and lentil have been produced at experimental stations and by
private commercial seed growers for rapid dissemination to farmers. 71% of ADCP-II
groups were satisfied and indicated that the quality of the seeds were either good or very
good, compared to 51% of the FOE/EEE groups.

45.     As a complement to the CES, a separate survey was conducted in May 2011 and
covered private seed farms (PSFs) in ten regions. Seed producing activities are the main
income- generating activities of PSFs. PSF mainly get seeds of wheat, maize, barley,
beans and clovers from the Regional Experimental Stations of NRICH in order to conduct
their seed producing activities. The PSFs achieved average productivity of 4560 kgs per
hectare during 2010, and sold on average to 14,324 farmers during the same year. 94%
of the surveyed PSFs indicated that profits have increased after joining the seed sale
system.

46.    Improved Vertical Integration: Under Agricultural Business Services
(Component 1), which sought to enhance links between production and markets, and
through access to financial services, as described in Annex 2, the Credit Union (CU) sub-
component provided over 46,000 loans in the total amount of AZN 61.86 million to
23,600 members of Borrowing Groups (BGs) and CUs to help investments in livestock,
crop and retail/trade as of March 31, 2011. The number of people accessing credit
through CUs was estimated at 14,216 as of September 30, 2011 (compared to the baseline
of 3,000). Farmers who obtained credit through the CUs comprised 47.5% (in comparison
to 37.8% in 2008).

47.     Previous research in ADCP areas had shown that farmers had a need for credit.
The CES respondents indicated that they were fully free to use credits for different areas,
and that their production had increased as a result of being able to obtain credit. Farmers
who engaged in livestock production prevailed in terms of getting credit. Farmers used
credit for the following purposes: livestock breeding (73% of farmers); livestock fattening
(58%); and stock feed (47%). In terms of the average quantity of livestock assets in
ADCP-II districts between 2006 and 2010, these increased, for example, for sheep and
goats, 16.95 (2006), 23.36 (2008) and 38.3 (2010). (See CES for other types of livestock
and poultry).




                                             12
48.    In terms of agricultural production, 42% of CES respondents used credit obtained
from CUs for crop seed, 35% for crop inputs, and 17% and 23% respectively for farm
machinery and transport equipment. 6.3%, 17% and 6.7% of the farmers respectively
reported increases in agricultural production of between 1-10%, 10-25% and over 25%
as a result of credit provided by the project. The main reasons why farmers did not use
CU services include the high interest rates and too short a loan period.

49.     ADCP-II also extended financial services to medium agribusinesses and provided
training to commercial banks. Through this program, sub-loans were disbursed to several
sectors, with 29.6%, 25.5% and 15.4% of the total disbursements going to animal
breeding and orchards and agro-processing respectively (see Annex 2, Table 3).

50.     The competitive grants program (CGP) awarded small grants for introducing
testing and transferring new and improved technologies emphasizing better market
accessibility, storage and small-scale processing. Farmers used grants for a range of
improved technologies for production, storage, grading, packaging, labeling, small-scale
processing and canning of different high-value products such as vegetables, citrus,
mushrooms, grapes, honey, seed, potatoes and strawberries. Grants were also used to
establish new storage and processing facilities, improve milk processing and poultry
technologies, develop efficient fish-raising techniques and introduce new drip irrigation
methods. The beneficiary contribution in the CGP at an average of 45% demonstrates
high ownership. Beneficiaries indicate that these activities have significantly influenced
the transfer of innovative technologies. 4 To demonstrate the technologies to other
potential adopters, each grant is required to carry out a program of technology transfer,
such as workshops, field days, publication of information leaflets, and television
emissions. The availability of credit has also encouraged farmers to integrate vertically.
Examples of this include: a nut processing/packaging company that went into paste
making; planting of hazelnut orchards; borrowers who bought more sheep to expand into
sheep milk production; a strawberry producer who bought processing equipment for jams;
and agricultural producers building storage facilities.

PDO Outcome #2: Production marketed for cash increased by 20% as a result of
increased quantity and improved quality of production.

51.    ADCP-II activities also helped farmers to market their increased production in
crops and livestock.

52.     The percentage of total production marketed for cash by participating farmers has
increased from 60.1 in 2006 to 75.5 in 2008, and to 76.6% 2010 (a 27% increase), with
the greatest rise seen in crops sold for cash (from 48.4% in 2006 to 74% in 2010)
compared to cattle. In comparison, FOE/EEE groups marketed 57.5% of their production
for cash in 2010. The breakdown by crop, livestock, and by region for ADCP-II
participants, FOE and EEE groups is discussed further in the respective surveys. With

 See CES 2011, p. 27 for details on the overall use of credit in terms of cattle-breeding methods, crop
cultivation etc.


                                                  13
 respect to the use of fertilizer, agricultural equipment (mainly farm machinery) used in
 cultivation, and the use of pastures, there are substantial differences between ADCP-II
 groups and FOE/EEE groups, with higher use among project participants.

 53.     With respect to sources of information and marketing channels, as detailed in
 Annex 2, under Component 2 (Agricultural Support Services), by the end of 2008, ADCP-
 II had a network of 10 RACs and 201 Village Training Rooms covering the entire country
 with IASs. In 2007 and 2008, ADCP-II successfully carried out the information campaign
 on “Processing and marketing of agricultural products? and the campaign on “Campaign
 on buffalo production? respectively. There were also training programs for PAs. Overall,
 ADCP-II realized the following physical outputs: 4711 Special Interest Groups were
 formed and consequently advisory projects have been implemented; and 38,288
 demonstration fields and 32,636 training courses have been established and carried out.
 Moreover, about 6,666 farmers have used individual advisory services. In total, some
 706,026 farmers have benefited from information and advisory services.

54.     Under Component 1, sub-component 4, which aimed to introduce a greater market
focus into the programs, ADCP-II established the Market Information and Commercial
Hub (MICH), although it was severely delayed. MICH’s objective was to provide farmers
with market information. Hence, 10 large markets covering large areas of the country
were selected for MICH, and information is being collected on a daily basis on key
variables such as wholesale and retail prices, farmer prices etc. There is also a website in
three languages. The project trained farmers on the MICH’s SMS and IVR services,
which were provided by the RAC’s private advisors. There are now about 201 private
advisors in 9 regions of the country and each advisor was expected to train 120-130
farmers, so about 24,000 of the farmers were trained in total. CES respondents indicated
that the MICH has created awareness in them. Prior to the MICH, farmers lacked full
information on sale prices, and were often selling their produce at very low prices. Now,
farmers can find out about demand and supply, and, if there is over-supply in Baku for
example, then farmers can choose to take their produce to a market that is offering higher
sale prices. Most farmers indicated that they use the IVR system. Since MICH started in
2010, it has reached about 3% of farmers, or a total of about 870,000 households.

55.     In the CES, farmers indicate that the most important technical information sources
are Private Advisors (70%), brochures and other written materials produced by RACs
(7.5%, and information obtained directly from RACs (5.1%) and Veterinary Field Units
(1.7%). The most important sources on prices of agricultural facilities again are RACs
and PAs. Generally, when all sources are summarized, local markets, other farmers,
agricultural producers and TV are of great importance as information sources.

56.     Farmers in ADCP-II areas use different channels to sell their cultivated and
produced plant-growing yields. Local markets (78%), local traders (58%), regional
markets (33%) and major urban areas (23%) are used the most. Very little differences
exist in the channels used for the sale of cattle-breeding yields (see CES, 2011, for further
on the specific marketing channels).

3.3 Efficiency

57.     The PAD estimated project economic rate of return (ERR) was 16.0%, and the net
present value (NPV) of the project’s net benefit stream, discounted at 12%, was US$4.1
million. The quantified incremental benefits used in the PAD analysis were based on: (a)
strengthened and expanded advisory services and improved access to new adapted
technologies; (b) strengthened and expanded veterinary services; and (c) models of likely
sub-projects to be implemented under the Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS).

58.     The evaluation at completion shows that the ERR is 20.5% and the NPV
US$25.74 million. Investments in the Agricultural Advisory Services components give an
ERR of 18.5% and a NPV of US$8.3 million, while the Veterinary Services shows an
ERR of 34.8% and a NPV of US$3.7 million. The CGP shows direct economic net
benefits with an ERR of 33.3% and a NPV of US$4.1 million. The support to medium and
large agribusiness through the project credit line channeled by financial intermediaries
(commercial Banks) is averages an ERR of 19% with a NPV of US$9.6 million. All



                                             15
assumptions used for this economic analysis were definitively conservative. Annex 3
presents the detailed analysis on the financial and economic benefits stemming from
conditions developed by the project at the time of the ICR preparation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

59.     ADCP-II was relevant at the time of appraisal and continues to be relevant. Its
components were also clearly linked and relevant to the PDO, as described in Section 3.1.
As presented in Section 3.2, the achievement of the PDO was satisfactory, with the
project exceeding all of the project outcome targets, and in most cases by a significant
margin. The final outcome survey showed that the proportion of project participants who
obtained credit, adopted improved crop and livestock technologies, obtained advisory
services, and used various marketing channels is consistently higher than individual
farmers (FOE groups) in the villages where the survey was held but not covered by the
project. The project farmers also had corresponding differences in production, crops sold
on the markets, incomes and profits. In terms of efficiency, the ERR and NPV at the time
of the ICR exceed those estimated in the PAD.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
60.      The CES provides evidence of reduced poverty through improved household food
security, welfare and incomes. For example, for ADCP-II beneficiaries the average for
‘the value of crops consumed at home’ was 919 AZN compared to EEE/FOE groups,
which indicated 554.8 (CES 2011, p. 57). Average profits from sales of animal and
animal products were 1978.6 AZN for ADCP-II farmers and 1176.9 for EEE/OFE groups.
Compared to 2006, project farmers also increased their incomes from ‘own farm’
activities and from ‘working on other farms’. In terms of welfare indicators, in all five
regions sampled, farmers’ possession of household assets (separate kitchens, piped water
supply in house, electricity inside house, regular and cell phone) improved substantially
from 2008 to 2010. Women also benefited from training and access to credit from CUs
and BGs. In discussions with farmers, a common view was that BGs (compared to CUs),
with their small size and members from the same community tended to favor integration
of women sometimes to a very large extent. (Project Performance Assessment Report,
July 28, 2008, p. 20).

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
61.     ADCP-II contributed to building long-term capacity in many areas. The project
provided technical assistance for developing recommendations for improving the legal
and regulatory framework for CUs, although it is yet not known if these recommendations
would be adopted (as they are still under review by the Central Bank); training was
provided for institutional strengthening of CUs, which are stronger than before, however,
governance remains an issue for some CUs; CIA and AKIA were strengthened through
review and adjustment of lending manuals for CIA and for AKIA, for establishing CUs.
These too need further strengthening to bring them up to the level capable of managing



                                           16
the CU sector independently, i.e. after ADCP-II. The Law on Information and Advisory
Services in Agriculture was drafted by IAC, which was a part of ADCP-II, and the draft is
being currently reviewed by Parliament.

62.     Overall institutional capacity of Azerbaijan’s Veterinary Services was boosted
through several activities under Component 2 (as described in Annex 2). These included
training programs, the brucellosis control program, scaling up of the National Animal
Disease Information System (AZVET), and strengthening of the Veterinary Faculty of
Ganja Agricultural University and the State Veterinary Service.

63.      As discussed in Annex 2, ADCP-II helped to build national capacity in terms of
strengthening technological linkages and enhancing the dissemination of adapted
technologies through reforming and equipping NRICH. For example, before reforms the
Institute had a common research program, while after reforms it has five research
programs that suit the new mandate, relevant research topics and staff, implementing
agencies and experimental stations, collaborating organizations, annual financing, and
expected outcomes. Staff capacity and the skill mix at NRICH have been enhanced
considerably through training programs and technical assistance. The project’s other
institutional development impacts cover areas such as developing procedures and
instruments required to supervise the compliance of CUs, strengthening the long-term
capacity in Azerbaijan’s agricultural certified seed system, expanding the extension and
advisory services, especially RACs, and the private sector’s ability to provide veterinary
services.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
64.     Implementation of the modernization program at NRICH has exerted significant
influence on cooperation with the public and private sectors and collaboration with
international research centers like ICARDA, CIMMYT and IPGRI. The Institute’s strive
to strengthen partnerships towards developing scientifically-grounded technologies have
paved the way for combining efforts of scientists and businessmen. The Institute has
started to collaborate with “Azertoxum?, which was established recently and is considered
a big seed producing company. The Institute is also collaborating with a number of
enterprises and institutions in the public and private sectors in implementing the
consolidated research plan. Good partnerships have been established with the Genetic
Resources Institute, Research Institute of Soil Sciences and Agro-chemistry (Academy of
Sciences), regional branch offices of Agrarian Science Center and other research Institutes
of the Ministry of Agriculture.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

65.    ADCP-II conducted a Completion Evaluation Survey (CES) in the first quarter of
2011, which covered economic indicators and productivity of 2010. A summary of the
CES findings are detailed in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: moderate



                                            17
The institutional risk to development outcome is moderate. As described in Section 3.5(b)
and in Annex 2, ADCP-II has built institutional capacity through training at every stage of
the agricultural activity. Project beneficiaries are likely to receive additional support under
ADCP-III, further reinforcing these local institutional structures. There are two areas,
however, where there is a moderate risk. First, the national extension services may be at
risk if GoA does not take a timely decision on maintaining the RACs, which have proved
to be effective in delivering extension services. There are options for the delivery of
extension services after project closing that have been proposed. These were reviewed by
the Working Group formed by the Presidential decree with the objective of working out
the recommendations for institutional strengthening of agricultural administration. The
proposed institutional set up for the extension services is being considered as an integral
part of the overall reform of the agricultural administration in the country. Therefore, the
mechanisms for future delivery of extension services will be included in the new
institutional structure for the agricultural sector in the country. However, it is important to
take a decision quickly to avoid a long gap in funding of the extension services system, as
otherwise, the survival of the model established under ADCP II will be at risk. The
second area of risk relates to developing private veterinary services, which is limited, as
the current veterinary law restricts private vets from providing public sector goods and
services such as vaccination, blood testing, inspections etc. While SVS is interested in
reforming the veterinary law and promoting private vets, the decision-making process on
key issues is slow and the capacity for overall upgrading the veterinary system is limited
(Operational Risk Assessment Framework, ADCP-III). On (i) above, MoA is working
closely with the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of Finance to consider options to
ensure sustainability of the extension services and the information and advisory system.

66.     The financial risk to development outcome is moderate. As described in Section
2.2, the repayment rate of a small group of CUs continues to be of concern. The weak
governance in some CUs is also a concern. CIA management needs to improve loan
underwriting/loan collections and monitoring of CUs. Strong vigilance by AKIA and CIA
in strengthening the CU internal control systems would be essential to ensure the
sustainability of the CUs over the longer term. If needed, legal procedures against wrong
doers should be encouraged. The government is yet to develop an exit strategy, including
mechanisms for further lending to CUs after the project life.

67.    The environmental risk to development outcome is low. Since the MTR identified
key environmental shortcomings as discussed in Section 2.4, the environmental
management system has improved, trainings have been successful, and substantial efforts
have been made to enhance the monitoring of sub-projects.

68.     The social risk to development outcome is low. It is likely that increasing
agricultural productivity and incomes of farming households will improve food security,
and the socioeconomic status of the poor and other vulnerable sections of Azerbaijan’s
rural population.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

69.    The Bank team continued to work closely with the client to prepare this second
phase of ADCP. The team included consultants as relevant, built on ADCP-I activities
and achievements, took into account lessons from the previous project, identified risks,
and incorporated appropriate risk mitigation measures. Specifically, the Bank did well in
designing several inter-linked project interventions, which made ADCP-II complex and
challenging in terms of supervision, but were necessary to address the linkages and the
main constraints to agricultural growth in Azerbaijan. The outcome indicators and the
Results Framework were well designed and relevant to the PDO. The MICH sub-
component, however, could have been better thought through (see Section 2.1).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

70.     The Bank was proactive in supervising ADCP-II and provided continuous
guidance for implementation. Supervision teams included the relevant specialists,
including from the FAO, to focus on the various component activities and to increase the
intensity of supervision when needed. The team is commended for the careful follow up
in ensuring improved implementation of environmental safeguards. Project Aide
Memoires and ISR documents were very comprehensive, especially with respect to
reporting on the Results Framework, and candid in terms of the ratings on overall
achievement of the PDO, implementation progress, and on safeguards. For example,
following the very first mission after project effectiveness, the IAS and veterinary services
sub-components were downgraded due to mishandling of procurement rules. The team
engaged closely with the PMU in these cases to come up with a workable action plan to
resolve issues.

71.    The CGP got off to a slow start. The approval process for the CGP could have
possibly been accelerated if the Bank had been more proactive in providing the PMU with
more training on how to evaluate proposals. At the MTR, when the licensing fees for
private veterinary practice and drug production presented a serious concern as it
undermined the project’s efforts to establish private veterinary services, the Bank took this
up with the Prime Minister’s office to resolve it in a suitable manner. The Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) panel for review of the Azerbaijan portfolio considered the MTR
for ADCP-II as Good Practice.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory
This rating reflects the ‘S’ rating for both Quality and Entry and Supervision.



                                             19
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.     The Government of Azerbaijan engaged closely in project identification and
preparation, and actively discussed the contents of each component and their costs. The
commitment was not always sufficient, however, to overcome administrative inertia and
there were delays, as discussed in Section 2.2, on the approval of some key project
documents. For example, MoF delayed in signing the Agency Agreement and in
approving the RIGs at the start of the project. Although these were resolved successfully,
these in turn delayed progress towards laying the foundation for good implementation.

73.     Recent observations suggest SAAC’s attempts to interfere in the implementation
of the CU sub-component, and, as a result, increasing tensions between SAAC and the
AKIA. The ground rules for regulating the relationship among the various parties are
clearly articulated in the Agency Agreement. The core assumption is that private
ownership and governance of the AKIA and CIA should be free of any administrative
interference. The existing tensions, if not addressed, could undermine this still fragile
system.

74.     The introduction of a very high fee for licensing private veterinarians, as discussed
in Section 2.2, was another factor, which undermined the project’s efforts to establish
private veterinary services. This issue took time to resolve, and involved the Bank having
to finally take it up with the Prime Minister’s office. The key issues that remain to be
addressed by the Borrower are: establishing of mechanisms and ensuing adequate funding
for sustainable provision of extension services after the project life; developing an exit
strategy for the CU sub-component; and improving the CU governing legislation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

75.    The State Agency for Agricultural Credits (SAAC) within the Ministry of
Agriculture was responsible for the implementation of agricultural projects, with the
Project Management Unit under the SAAC specifically responsible for ADCP-II. In
general, the PMU was proactive and carried out their duties in an efficient and timely way.
Having become familiar with Bank procedures during the implementation of previous
Bank projects (FPP and ADCP-I), the PMU performed efficiently under ADCP- II. The
PMU managed suitable financial, accounting and reporting systems that provided
adequate and timely information for implementation and review. There was strong
teamwork and commitment to high quality standards that contributed to successful
implementation. There were a couple of procurement issues (most notably, moving ahead
with the contracts for the private sector entities to continue operating the existing RACs
before no objection had been received, however, these may have been more an error of
enthusiasm, and were resolved successfully.




                                             20
76.    It should be noted that for the advisory services, CGP and veterinary services,
most of the M&E was carried out by the units responsible rather than by the PMU M&E
unit, which was primarily a receiver of information. The effectiveness of the M&E
system was substantially enhanced by strong internal M&E programs built into several of
the components, rather than relying on a project M&E unit alone. It should also be noted
that implementing agency performance was enhanced by the establishment of strong units
within the PMU – notably the IAC and the CGP Secretariat, which were effectively given
independence and responsibility to carry out their programs.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
77.     This reflects the ‘MS’ rating for Government and the ‘S’ rating for the
Implementing Agency performance.

6. Lessons Learned

With respect to lessons learned under the different activities, these are:

78.     Advisory Services: (i) The value of long-term involvement (by the World Bank)
in the development of a sustainable advisory system is evident; (ii) a system that contracts
private sector providers of advisory services can be a very effective means to provide
information and knowledge to small farmers; (iii) a strong control and M&E system is an
essential element to maintain quality. As mentioned above, M&E was done directly by
the IAS, and not by the M&E unit of the PMU; (iv) clear performance targets for the
contracted private sector providers are an essential element; and (v) the use of a range of
mechanisms, including farmer training courses, field demonstrations, working through
special interest groups, and information campaigns was effective.

79.     Competitive Grants Program: (i) The CGP was effective in supporting
emerging rural businesses and farmer groups to introduce and test innovative technologies
and initiatives. It was also effective in demonstrating and providing examples to a broader
audience of potential rural entrepreneurs and beneficiaries and, thus, to support the
process of linking production and processing. The CGP approach proved responsive to the
needs of the clients (farmers and rural businesses); (ii) the wide information-sharing and
publicity program, and support to potential applicants during the application stage, led to
improvements in the quality of proposals and encouraged emulation and adoption of
successful technologies; (iii) clear and transparent procedures and criteria are an essential
element; (iv) a dedicated Secretariat, with continuity throughout the project, was a key
element; (v) regular feedback through a strong M&E program carried out by the
Secretariat enabled adaption and improvement of procedures and methodologies. Again,
as above, the M&E was carried out directly by the Secretariat rather than the M&E unit of
the PMU; (vi) the impact was most likely greater due to innovative ideas coming from
different fields rather than through selection of specific value chains.




                                              21
80.     MICH: Under ADCP-I, a market information system was started that collected
market prices both in Baku markets and in the RACs. The information was collated by the
IAC in Baku and then sent back to the RACs to make available to the Private Advisors
and farmers. The PAs would normally display the information in their advisory rooms.
Although this system was not particularly effective, but it represented a start - in fact the
RACs continued price collection activities under ADCP-II. Under ADCP-II, the MICH
was intended to streamline this to include an SMS system and to try to put it on private
sector basis. While in principle this was a good idea, it might have been better to have
continued to work through the IAC and build on what had already been done, rather than
establishing a new unit. (The MICH unit was placed along with the Research and
Competitive Grants, and became an "orphan" there). Important lessons here are the need
to more effectively build on previous efforts, and to conduct an information campaign in
advertising and promotion of the system to increase customer base that will eventually
make the system more sustainable.

81.    NRICH: The requirement that NRICH linked with the advisory services increased
relevance and outreach of the demonstration program and was an important factor in its
successful implementation.

82.     Overall Lessons: The Government should use the concept of public-private
partnerships and promote such partnerships in other areas. Under ADCP-II, public-private
partnerships in the dissemination of information, for example, in extension services, was
innovative and worked well. As described in Annex 2, collaboration with the public and
private sectors in implementing the modernization program of NRICH, the consolidated
research plan, and in getting periodical information to and from farmers provide good
examples.

83.    Under ADCP-I, the Competitive Grant Program covered only research. ADCP-II
extended the Program and further developed it to give resources to enterprise development.
The CGP is well-established and has worked well overall. The CGP/matching grants
schemes could be used more extensively in ADCP-III, and in general.

84.     The decision to choose only one research institute for reform and modernization,
pursue reforms (although initially there was some resistance, and progress was slow) and
do it properly provides a valuable lesson. The reform of NRICH was well-designed, well-
executed, and, overall, very successful. Azerbaijan now plans to continue with such
reforms at other institutes. Other countries (for example, Uzbekistan and Georgia) have
also expressed interest in emulating this example.

85.     Another lesson is the value of rapid reaction to evolving needs, and inclusion of
new activities within the scope of the project objectives, such as the activities under AZ-
VET, which were not originally envisaged by the project, but were included later to scale-
up the system established under the Avian Influenza project.

                          Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Agricultural Business Services

This component sought to support rural businesses to improve the linkages between their
production and markets, and to enhance access to financial services by small and medium
rural enterprises (including farmers), agro-processors, and other forms of agribusinesses,
through: capacity building in PFIs in order to improve their staffs lending skills and to
promote new financial products; and providing badly needed funds for lending to their
clients. The component included four sub-components: (1) Financial Services for Small
Agribusiness/Credit Unions; (2) Financial Services for Medium Agribusinesses/Banks and
Leasing Companies; (3) Development of Efficient Rural Market Links; and (4) Rural
Business Advisory and Market Services.

Three key performance indicators (KPIs) were specified under this component.
Achievements under each KPI by component are given in Annex 2 Appendix 1.

Under ADCP-I, 30 CUs and 1,300 joint liability borrower groups (BGs) had been created,
and together, the BGs and CUs had provided credit to around 31,000 farmers and rural
businesses. The recovery rate had been estimated at 95%. The number of clients
accessing CUs was about 3,000. Building on these gains, ADCP-II was to support an
additional 20-30 CUs, and was expected to reach about 10,000 CU members at the end of
the project. Lending to BGs was to continue under ADCP-II, however, in the later stages,
lending to BGs was to be phased out to allow sufficient funding and growth of the CU
network, given that lending through BGs was not sustainable in the absence of further
funding support, while the CU network could become sustainable.

Outputs:

Component 1, sub-Component (1). ADCP-II provided over 50,700 loans in the total
amount of AZN 71.10 million to 23,600 members of Borrowing Groups (BGs) and CUs to
help investments in livestock, crop and retail/trade as of September 30, 2011. The number
of people accessing credit through CUs was estimated at 14,216 as of September 30, 2011
(compared to the baseline of 3,000). Demand for loans continues to be very high.
Lending to CUs increased by 92% from AZN 27 million in December 2009 to AZN 51.9
million in September 2011. The average loan size was around AZN 640 to members of
BGs and about AZN 2460 per individual member of CU. The portfolio to BGs continues
to decrease, albeit slowly (from ANZ 2.56 million on December 30, 2009 to AZN 1.6
million on September , 2011), which is a positive development, as ADCP II aimed to
move lending from BGs to CUs. The overall financial recovery rate increased from the
baseline of 95% to 97.42% as of September 30, 2010. However, as mentioned in Section
2.2, the problems with repayments in some of the CUs affected the financial status of the
Credit Implementing Agency (CIA).

Capacity Building for CUs. ADCP-II also supported technical assistance for: legal and
regulatory reform; training, updating the CU MIS; and for expanding the CU network.



                                           25
The objective of legal and regulatory reform was to create an environment for effective
supervision of CUs in order to progressively and effectively introduce deposit-taking
services. These reforms were delayed, however, the PMU hired an international expert to
review and make recommendations to modernize the legal and regulatory framework for
CUs. The consultant’s recommendations are being reviewed by the Central Bank of
Azerbaijan

CU Training. A training plan was designed by AKIA (Azerbaijan Credit Union
Association) based on the needs identified during the technical review of CUs. The draft
training materials were prepared and finalized by the international consultants hired by the
PMU to deliver the training. All training materials were expanded to include case studies
and useful real life examples, and the project delivered training in all four main topics
(Table 1).

Updating the CU management information system (MIS). These outputs were delayed
considerably due to procurement delays. However, the MIS has now been installed and
the trainings on software have been completed. The overall objective in acquiring this
software was to improve the quality and accuracy of the data and information collected,
and to standardize the information system. Some CUs have requested additional trainings,
therefore at present, additional trainings are being provided to several CUs.

Expanding the CU network. ADCP-II successfully facilitated the creation of 20 new
CUs and expanded the activities of the 30 that existed at the end of ADCP-I by extending
the credit line, capacity building (trainings, international and national technical assistance)
and provision of MIS software.

Component 1, sub-Component (2). ADCP-II, through the second sub-component, was
to provide a credit line for use by banks and leasing companies to extend investment
loans/leases to agribusinesses. It was also to support capacity building to participating
financial institutions (PFIs) to improve their skills in appraising rural and agriculture-
related medium and long-term investments, in risk assessment and management, and in
product innovation.

Sub-sectors financed. As shown in Table 2, the three PFIs issued a total of 116 sub-loans,
including 99 from the credit line directly and 17 from the revolving fund. PFIs have
financed a broad range of sub-sectors to ensure the appropriate diversification of the
portfolio. Although initially the sub-loans were concentrated in financing livestock and
sheep breeding for milk and meat, the project managed to agree with authorities to limit
lending to one subsector to 30% of each PFI’s project portfolio and hence diversify
business activities supported by the Credit Line. At the end of the project, livestock loans
of the total Credit Line disbursements amount to 29.6%. Two of the PFIs achieved a share
of livestock loans of 26.6% and 26.1%, while the share of livestock loans in portfolio of
Technikabank remained at 36.3%, due to the very high concentration of such loans in this
Bank’s portfolio at the initial stage of deployment of the project Credit Line.

The interest rates to the final borrowers were about 8%-13% in US Dollars and between 7-
11% in AZN. The average sub-loan size is around US$153,600. Overall, the sub-loans
are well diversified in size, ranging from US$25,000 to US$300,000, and 35 of the 116
sub-loans provided were under US$100,000. Except for one three-year loan, all other
sub-loans have maturities between 5 and 7 years, inclusive of a grace period of 2 – 3 years



                                                27
(in a very few cases the grace period is between 12 and 18 months). There were no
problems experienced with these sub-loans.

Key Impacts of the Credit Line: (i) 1,342 new jobs were created by the sub-borrowers;
and (ii) the average income of the sub-borrowers has doubled, from AZN 50-60 thousand
before the financing, to AZN 100-150 thousand.

PFI Training. ADCP-II was to provide training to PFIs on specifics of lending/leasing to
agribusinesses, and, in particular, the appraisal of medium and long-term rural
investments, including their associated risks. Training was also to focus on innovative
financial projects in order to enrich their product offering. A complementary training
program was designed for the PFIs under the project and covered training of about 90 loan
officers and 60 branch managers in Investment Lending/Leasing in Agriculture and New
Financial Products (structured finance) in Agriculture, as well as PFI staff training in
Environmental Issues. Training in New Financial Products was also successfully
completed. An international consultant delivered a seven-week training program to 97
staff representing 11 banks, Credit Implementing Agency and the PMU, including 27
branch managers and 46 loan officers from three PFIs (Appendix 2, Aide Memoire, March
2011).

Although delayed, the project delivered training in Investment Lending/Leasing in
Agriculture during 2010. It followed the same approach as the training in new financial
products. The training was delivered to 76 staff, including to 12 loan officers and 6 branch
managers from PFIs and 50 loan officers and managers from 9 other banks and credit
organizations. Eight staff members of SAAC and PMU also attended the training. Overall,
the trainees were satisfied with the quality of the training and the professional skills of the
trainers. (The results of post-training evaluation are summarized in Table 4, Annex 1,
Aide Memoire, March, 2011).

Two staff members of the Azerbaijan Bank Training Center (ABTC), the local training
provider hired under the project in the role of the National Consultant were also trained
with the objective to take over the training of PFIs after the international consultant
completed the assignment. A program of subsequent training on both topics was
advertized in August 2010 and a number of training courses has already been delivered. In
total, 14 branch managers and 64 loan officers from 32 banks and credit organizations
participated in the courses. A series of training sessions on environmental aspects of
credit line to agribusiness were delivered to the PFIs’ staff by the PMU environmental
specialist. Twenty loan officers from the three PFIs received the training.

Study Tour to the Netherlands. The project supported a study tour to the Netherlands
for the management of the PFIs with the objective of providing an opportunity to obtain
knowledge on lending to the agriculture sector in a country with a developed agricultural
lending system. The tour was organized by Rabo International Advisory Services and
allowed the PFIs to learn more about the new financial products for agriculture (on which
they have obtained theoretical knowledge during the training) in order to better service
their customers in the agricultural sector, and risk management instruments. The agenda
of the tour included topics such as value chain financing (including experience in


                                              28
emerging market), overview of agricultural finance system in the Netherlands, visits to a
local Rabobank and some of its primary agricultural clients, visits to an auction house, and
a workshop to discuss how these practices can be implemented within Azerbaijan.
Overall, the tour was valued very highly by participants.

Other Impacts of Component Activities on the PFIs. The main impact of the project on
the PFIs has been the increased interest of the PFIs in agricultural lending. A new
agricultural lending unit was established in Muganbank, on the basis of experiences
obtained during the study tour to Rabobank. The agricultural portfolios in the PFIs have
increased compared to the pre-project situation: in Muganbank, while loans for
agriculture-related activities represented 7-8 % of the bank’s credit portfolio before the
project, the share of agricultural loans has grown to 20-22%; in Turanbank, the share of
agricultural loans has grown from 9-10% of the credit portfolio to 25-30%; and in
Technikabank, the share of agricultural loans has increased from 5-6% of the credit
portfolio to 15-18% of the total credit portfolio.

Component 1, sub-Component (3). This sub-component consisted of a Competitive
Grants Program (CGP) that awarded small grants for introducing, testing and transferring
new and improved technologies emphasizing improved market accessibility, storage and
small-scale processing.

Competitive Grants Program (CGP). In total, 65 first, second, third and fourth-round
grant projects have been completed. All projects from the first three rounds have been
evaluated. The average grant amount was US$22,951, higher than the originally estimated
amount partly due to rapidly increasing prices and changing exchange rates. The
beneficiary contribution averages 44.83% of the total grant project cost. This high
contribution is considered as a very positive indicator of the applicants’ “ownership? of
the project activities and likely sustainability after project completion. The quality of
proposals has improved with each subsequent round, as is mainly attributed to the
rigorous information and intensive training program.

Grant topics. The grants cover a range of improved technologies for production, storage,
grading, packaging, labeling, small-scale processing and canning of different high-value


                                             29
products such as vegetables, citrus, mushrooms, grapes, honey, seed, potatoes and
strawberries. Grants are also being used to establish new storage and processing facilities,
improve milk processing and poultry technologies, develop efficient fish-raising
techniques and introduce new drip irrigation methods. 47.3% of grant projects deals with
crop production and 52.7% with animal husbandry. The projects focusing on small-scale
processing, marketing, packing, and storage of agricultural commodities constitute about
30% of all sub-projects.
Technology transfer. To demonstrate the technologies to other potential adopters, each
grant is required to carry out a program of technology transfer, such as workshops, field
days, publication of information leaflets, and television emissions. These activities have
influenced significantly the transfer of the innovative technologies. Different rural
business groups covered by technology transfer activities have already demonstrated their
interest in introduction of demonstrated technologies.
Performance of grant projects and ex-post evaluation. All first, three round sub-
projects were completed and evaluated. The evaluations include an assessment of the
achievements including success in developing the technology; the extent of dissemination
and adoption of the technology by other indirect beneficiaries; the actual and potential
impact on direct beneficiaries’ incomes; and the effect on productivity, institutional
capacity and market linkages. A cost-benefit analysis of the technology used was also
included in each evaluation for only one year. Overall, fifteen grants were rated highly
satisfactory, twenty one were rated satisfactory, twenty five were rated moderately
satisfactory and only one was less than satisfactory. During the evaluation of the second
and the third round projects attention was paid to the indicators such as: identification and
evaluation of rural marketing linkages created under the project; sustainability of project
activities; economic impact of the project for a period over 3 years compared with the
initial estimation; technology demonstration and transfer in the area followed by
examples.

Publicity. Booklets have been published and widely distributed, the preparation of the
book containing the final evaluation for grant projects and the CGP implementation was
started. A national workshop is planned for January 2012 to discuss the progress with
ADCP-II implementation. The first national one-day workshop was carried out
successfully in April 2009. The workshop focused on CGS application procedures and
criteria, presentations on progress of the grant program by the CGS Secretariat, and inputs
from grant winners and/or their service providers. The results from 62 completed grant
projects will be presented at the project final workshop scheduled for February 2012. In
addition to the workshop, a booklet has been prepared by the PMU to publish evaluation
of the completed projects. The booklet will be widely disseminated to interested
institutions including banks, NGOs, government organizations including the Ministry of
Agriculture, the advisory system including the RACs, and other donors. Information on
the CGS has also been posted on the website and in national newspapers.

Component 1, sub-Component (4). This activity aimed to further develop the
information and advisory services by introducing a greater market focus into the programs
and by developing a market information system, the Market Information and Commercial
Hub (MICH). The MICH was substantially delayed, as the first procurement round failed


                                             30
as the Turkish company selected for establishing the Market Information and Commercial
Hub (MICH) submitted a financial proposal of US$2.3 million, far in excess of the
US$280,000 budgeted for this activity. Therefore, the TORs for establishing MICH and
the Operational Manual were modified to scale down MICH activities. A local company
(Azerbaijan Marketing Society) was selected and contracted out on July 21, 2009 for the
implementation of MICH-related activities on the basis of modified TOR. Some
preliminary activities such as: development of methodologies for developing agricultural
commodities grading, price collection in 9 regions, conduct studies, contract a
communication service company, select suitable software and testing of some activities
have been implemented. Also a market survey has been completed. Based on the findings
of the survey, thorough methodology for the price collection and primary data processing
has been developed. The development of software for the MICH website
(http://agrobusiness.az/agro/az/), IVR system and SMS services have also been finalized.

A 4 digit call number (6599) has been procured and is already operational and the system
has been tested. At present, any person in Azerbaijan with a mobile phone can enter into
this system and obtain information regarding the prices of agricultural products from Baku
and 9 regional markets.

Farmer training. The training program for farmers on the MICH’s SMS and IVR
services has been provided by the private advisors (PAs). Altogether, about 24,000
farmers have been trained. During the training, the MICH’s SMS and IVR services were
offered free of charge to facilitate trial use of the services by farmers participating in the
trainings.

Study tours. The project supported a study tour to Cambodia for staff of MICH and the
PMU to provide them with the opportunity to learn from the experience of the Cambodia
Agricultural Market information Project (CAMIP) jointly funded by the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Government. The objectives and
activities of CAMIP are very similar to what is envisaged under the MICH and therefore
this project was selected as the most relevant to visit. The participants reported that the
study tour was successful as it provided an opportunity to learn in more practical terms
about the SMS-based MIS and other features of the project, such as Farmer Marketing
Schools as a good experience in stimulation of the demand for MIS's services.

Component 2. Agricultural Support Services

This component sought to help farmers to improve their productivity and quality of
production by expanding the outreach of the advisory system, strengthening the provision
of private veterinary services, and improving access to adapted technologies. It included
three sub-components: (1) Information and Advisory Services, to build on the foundations
established under ADCP-I and further develop the advisory system to cover a wider
geographical area using a similar approach; (2) Veterinary Services, to enhance access to
quality veterinary services throughout the country by expanding and strengthening the
private Veterinary Field Unit (VFU) system, supporting the privatization of the State
Veterinary Service (SVS) field services staff, strengthening the disease surveillance and



                                             31
preparedness systems, and implementing an agreed control program against at least two
priority diseases; and (3) Improved Access to Adapted Technologies, where ADCP-II was
to build on the experience gained under ADCP-I and provide one or two selected research
institutes to improve their capacity to develop and demonstrate adapted technologies,
focusing on variety improvement and crop husbandry.

Outputs:

Component 2, sub-Component (1). Within the Information and Advisory Services
(IASs) sub-component, contracts with the RACs which had been established during
ADCP-I (Gandja, Sheki, Masalli, Nakchivan and Beylagan) were renewed during 2007
for a period of 2 years. The National Advisory Board was established on July 24, 2007 by
the degree N 197 of the Ministry of Agriculture. In 2008, five more RACs covering 27
administrative districts were contracted out and these became operational. Therefore, as of
the end of 2008, the network of 10 RACs and 201 Village Training Rooms covered the
entire country with IASs.

In 2007 and 2008, ADCP-II successfully carried out the information campaign on
“Processing and marketing of agricultural products? and the campaign on “Campaign on
buffalo production? respectively. Three training programs for Private Advisers (PAs) in
agro-marketing, farm business management and food security issues were carried out in
the five ADCP I RACs. The farm business management course was also conducted in
five of the new RACs. 99 PAs from ADCP I RACs’ were selected and provided with
notebooks. Training courses on computer use for the new RACs PAs was also provided in
2009.

Overall, ADCP-II realized the following physical outputs: 5485 Special Interest Groups
were formed and consequently advisory projects have been implemented; and 39,776
demonstration fields and 32,636 training courses have been established and carried out.
Moreover, about 8,264 farmers have used individual advisory services. In total, some
736,302 farmers have benefited from information and advisory services.

Component 2, sub-Component (2). The following outputs were achieved under the
Veterinary Services sub-component.

Private Veterinary Units (PVUs). The Project continued to work with the initial 25
PVUs established under ADCP-I and extended this to establish 30 new PVUs in six
regions (Tovuz, Goychay, Devechi, Ismailli, Yevlakh and Salyan). All PVUs have been
provided with required induction trainings, facilities, equipment and medications, and
each of them has completed the survey on disease surveillance and livestock productivity.
The PVUs have all essentially graduated from the support program and are sustainable,


                                                   33
but continue to benefit from the ADCP-II training program. The PVUs are all fully
operational as planned with the total program of 55 PVUs now comprising some 160
veterinarians. All PVUs achieved the defined performance milestones and are deemed to
be operationally self-sufficient, which indicate potential for the PVUs to become fully
sustainable (see Aide Memoire, March 2011). Overall, the use of the service seems to be
increasing gradually and has had a positive impact on livestock production. Surveys
indicate that 90% of livestock owners using the PVU services are satisfied with the quality
of the services. The request by the Government to scale this program up country-wide
and to incorporate an additional 800 veterinarians is an acknowledgement of its results.

Training program for the PVUs is underway. There were several areas identified for
practical and applied training of PVUs related to: (i) basic business practices (ii) clinical
practice including diagnosis and treatment of farm animals including surgical procedures,
(iii) pharmacology including application and availability of improved veterinary
medications, and (iv) simple field necropsy and laboratory examination methods.
Training courses have been delivered by an international veterinary clinical specialist to a
total of 260 veterinarians from 56 regions. A national conference of PVUs and private
practitioners is scheduled for December 2011 to share the experience with the private
veterinary practices, to discuss the lessons learned and to lay the groundwork for the
establishment of an association of private veterinarians.

Brucellosis Control program. ADCP-II started to support a pilot program for the control
of brucellosis in cattle and sheep to reduce the incidence of human brucellosis. It was
initially focused on Balakan, Zagatala, Gakh and Sheki regions. An international
epidemiology specialist drafted a detailed plan for the implementation of this program and
to initiate the vaccination program as part of this plan. In this regard the brucellosis
serological survey was completed on April 20, 2009, encompassing 20 randomly selected
villages and households in four designated regions and a report was developed.
According to the survey results, the infection rate in livestock was significant and varying
from 1.2% to up to 11.8%. Moreover blood samples from people at potential risk (about
342 from Zagatala and 235 from Balakan) were tested; according to the results 8.8% were
serologically positive in Zagatala and 6.4% in people in Balakan were positive reactors.
Based on extensive experience in other countries in the region, such levels of brucellosis
in livestock and related high sero-prevalence in people would be expected to be
accompanied by significant level of human infections and clinical cases. The project is in
the process of analyzing concurrent human data and economic impact related to livestock
production and human health. A joint seminar was organized for veterinarians and public
health specialists to highlight the issue.

It has also been noted that the animal health component and brucellosis control program
have been designed and implemented in close collaboration with other projects and donors
including: (i) the WB-financed avian influenza project, (ii) the US-DTRA project for
laboratory upgrading and (iii) the USAID-funded STOP AI program for avian influenza.
Comprehensive and practical training materials were developed under the STOP AI
program, for example, published under the ADCP II project and distributed to all
veterinarians, PVUs and to the university faculty. These have been used by PVUs to



                                             34
provide training and extension to farmers and, as reported to the SPN missions have
stimulated farmer interest, interventions and created revenues for the PVUs. Upgrading of
laboratories throughout the country was strategically shared between the DTRA Project
and ADCP II investment.

The vaccination program has been established and is working well. The program was
started in April 2009 in four regions, with initial vaccination of a total of 490,000 sheep
and goats. An additional 270,000 doses of REV-1 vaccines were procured and used in the
region during 2009 and 2010. The SVS has also procured about 4 million doses of Rev 1
for a national control program starting in 2011 which will be based on whole flock
vaccination of sheep and goats and replacement females. According to official census
data there are 5.1 million ewes and an expected 1.5 million immature females that would
be eligible for vaccination in 2011. The abortion rate in small ruminants was selected as a
proxy indicator for the evaluating the results of vaccination program. Accordingly this
indicator has decreased by 60-70%. Although the abortion rate in small ruminants is a
good surrogate measure of results, reduction in human cases and repeat of the serological
survey three years after the start of vaccination is a much better measure of results and
will be carried out by the Government under a proposed follow-on project.

National Animal Disease Information System (AZVET). The AZVET was fully
operational in twenty regions, including the brucellosis pilot regions, and training was
provided. However, the adoption of the system for data collection and reporting has been
very slow. The project supported a study tour to Turkey to review the national system
there and the TURKVET system as a basis for further development of AZVET. The
project encountered particular problems in trying to integrate the AZVET with the DTRA
EIDSS system which was being concurrently and misleadingly promoted by DTRA as a
national system. The SVS has since adopted the approach to link the EIDSS as a module
for dangerous pathogens in the overall AZVET system which is recognized as a national
system

The Veterinary Faculty of Ganja Agricultural University (GAU-VF). The project has
been successfully cooperating with the VF in close coordination with other donors (FAO,
USDA) and WB-funded Avian Influenza operation. The AI Project supported the
development of a faculty self-assessment tool that is intended to direct reforms and
upgrading. The VF completed its strategic development plan with support of AI Project
and began to implement it with significant and impressive results. ADCP –II subsequently
provided resources to establish a PVU at the VF to provide hands-on farm service training
for students. This IT facility has been used for training students and SVS staff country-
wide on the use of the AZVET system under the ADCP II. The project also provided
practice opportunities for students and faculty, many of whom were involved in the
brucellosis control program to gain hands-on experience and the VF is working closely
with the more successful PVUs to expose students to this work as a career option after
graduation. This approach to faculty upgrading has been used as a case study and the
approach endorsed by the OIE as the basis for future work in other countries.




                                            35
Component 2, sub-Component (3). The project supported the modernization of the
National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry and Crop Diversification (NRICH),
which was selected by the MOA as the pilot institute for reform. Following the
requirements of the Modernization Program, NRICH was re-organized to meet needs of
farmers and market competitiveness and to ensure better services. The Advisory Board
representing all stakeholders was established for the first time. The Board takes
responsibility that research works meet farmers’ needs and carried out in accordance with
standards. The Board includes leading scientists from outside the Institute, representatives
of appropriate ministries, committees, and other relevant bodies, as well as private sector
representatives’ and farmers. The Chairman represents private sector. Eight crops out of
12 have been removed from the Institute’s mandate and the new mandate includes only 4
crops including wheat, barley, maize and food legumes. More attention is given to crop
diversification.

Consolidated research plans. The Institute now has a consolidated research program for
the period of 2010-2014. Research plans have been prepared by each department and
laboratory of NRICH. The plans envisage participation of beneficiaries in the studies and
attach importance to farmer participatory investigations. Experience of the Competitive
Grant Program implemented under ADCP I has been taken into consideration in
developing the research plans. Research objectives meet basic needs of farmers and have
been transferred to research projects reflecting research methods, budget and work plans.

Upgrading of NRICH facilities. The main building of NRICH was renovated in late
2010, with additional financial support provided by the Government of Azerbaijan. In
addition, the seed storage house of Tartar Experimental Station was also rehabilitated on
the project account. All necessary equipment, including lab equipment has been procured.
The project has also provided 42 items of farm and seed equipment, for the Institute and
five Regional Experimental Stations.

On-farm demonstrations of technologies. There is a good collaborative demonstration
program between the NRICH and the RACs. This program is considered very important
and successful in transferring new agricultural technologies to farmers. In the 2010/11
cropping season, 37 on-farm demonstrations were conducted by the Institute and RACs in
30 villages of 22 regions. These demonstrations were conducted to demonstrate the
performance of new varieties, efficient agronomic practices, water-saving technologies,
conservation agriculture with wheat, barley, maize, chickpea and lentil both under
irrigated and rain-fed farming systems. Future plans include conducting several field days,
workshops and discussion groups with farmers, local officials, PAs employed by RACs,
and Research and Extension members of the Board. The results will be analyzed in the fall
of 2011and posted on the Institute’s website, and will be considered in planning the
2011/12 demonstration program.

In the 2010 cropping season, which was unfavorable for crop production, wheat
demonstrations at 40 farmer fields gave a yield of 3.5 ton/ha, while the yield of
progressive farmers near the demonstration plots was only 2.1 ton per hectare. The use of
new varieties and production technologies increased profitability by 43.2%. Cultivation of



                                            36
this variety by farmers enabled them to harvest 0.3 ton more yield per hectare and increase
their profits by 31.5%. On farm demonstration of maize has been arranged in 3 farms that
yielded good results.

Provision of new varieties and seeds. Since 2007 nine crop varieties 5 have been
officially registered by State Commission for Testing and Protection of Breeding
Achievements and are already under commercial cultivation. Based on their grain yield,
disease resistance and quality 2 new wheat varieties, 1 barley variety, 1 maize variety, and
1 lentil variety were also registered in 2009. Some of the varieties commonly grown by
farmers have become highly susceptible to yellow rust and therefore it has become all the
more important to rapidly replace these varieties with yellow rust resistant new varieties
that were recently registered. The availability of good quality chickpea and lentil will also
contribute to crop diversification. Furthermore, 7 new crop varieties, including 4 wheat, 2
barley and 1 chickpea varieties have been submitted to the State Commission for Testing
and Protection of Breeding Achievements in the course of the last 4 years. The
experimental stations have already produced good quantities of super-elite and elite seeds
of these varieties and they have been provided to seed growers in 2010. For example in
2009, 70 tons elite seed of new bread wheat variety Aran and Gobustan were produced at
the experimental stations and given to 16 seed growers who are producing commercial
seed of this variety in around 350 hectares. Similarly, the seeds of other new varieties of
wheat, barley, maize, chickpea and lentil are being produced at the experimental stations
and by private commercial seed growers for rapid dissemination of these varieties to
farmers. In 2010, NRICH farms produced 769 ton super-elite and elite seeds of which 681
tons were wheat seeds and 88 tons were barley seed.

There were also 10.6 tons of maize seeds and 1 ton of chickpea seeds that were produced.
The reduction in seed production compared to 2007-2009 is related to climate changes
(cold weather in early spring and dry hot weather in summer). Compared to 2006, seed
production increased by 60.4%. The seeds produced were provided to 82 certified seed
growers for fall sowing in 2010. 90 private seed growers and 22 state seed producing
farms received 1189 ton super elite and elite seeds produced by the Institute in 2009.

According to survey results 12 thousand first reproduction seeds of cereals produced by
seed growers were sold to 9520 farmers. These farmers have produced 70908 tons of R2
seeds, which have been provided to 47600 cereal producers. Such distribution of seeds
contributes to dissemination of new resistant and high yielding crop varieties.

Training and human resources development. One of the most valuable resources of the
Institute is its staff. In accordance with the training program six young scientists of
NRICH have received training at ICARDA on crop breeding (2 staff), plant physiology
and biotechnology (1 staff), grain quality analysis (2 staff), and on soil and plant analysis
(1 staff). Thirteen scientists from the Institute and Experimental Stations have attended in-
country crop breeding training courses. In addition, 24 scientists have completed training
courses on computer skills and 25 scientists on English language.

The Institute has established close ties with several universities and research stations
abroad. There is good cooperation with international crop research centers like ICARDA
and CIMMYT. In the course of the last 3 years, 81 scientists from NRICH have attended
29 different international events. A large number of breeding materials and research
results have been exchanged. Seventeen researchers have attended short and long-term
training courses at the international agricultural centers over the last 3 years. NRICH staff
has also received training in the use of lab equipment.

Contribution of the Institutes research outputs (new varieties of wheat, barley, maize
and food legumes) to the country’s food security. The State Program on “Reliable
provision of the population of Azerbaijan Republic with foodstuff in the course of 2008-
2015 years? aims to extend crop area under cereals up to 900 thousand hectares and
produce a total of 2.8 million tons of cereals from this area by increasing the average
productivity of cereals to 3.2 ton. Hence, importance is attached to development of new
high yielding crops, their testing, registration and introduction of efficient production
technologies. In this view, research works being carried out at NRICH assume great
importance. At present nearly 80-85% of wheat fields, 100% of barley fields, 90% of
maize fields and food legumes 85% fields were sown with varieties released by NRICH.
Almost 72% of 54 crop varieties (24 bread wheat, 9 durum wheat, 8 barley, 6 maize, 5
chickpea and 2 lentil varieties) registered by State Commission for Testing and Protection
of Selection Achievements were released by NRICH for which patents were granted.
Almost 90% and 65% of the requirement of super elite and elite seeds for 2009 and 2010
have respectively been met in the country by Regional Experimental Stations of NRICH.

Liaisons with private and public sector. Implementation of modernization program of
NRICH has exerted significant influence on cooperation with the private sector. With the
purpose of establishing close cooperation with the private sector and for building up
partnerships, representatives of the private sector were included on the new Advisory
Board of NRICH to ensure consideration of producers’ needs when developing research
plan of the institute. Close relations have been established with RACs established in the
framework of the Project and PAs employed by RACs. Farmer participatory development
and implementation of demonstration plans, farmers’ participation in workshops, field
days and on-farm demonstrations and live contact established between researchers and

farmers enabled to get periodical information on farmers’ needs. The Institute has gained
the possibility to direct its research plan towards meeting farmers’ needs, to production
packages and services that could be offered to private sector. In addition, the institute is
interested in providing private sector with information on its research potential, services
and research outputs that could be offered. Discussions held with managers of the Institute
revealed that NRICH strives for strengthening partnership towards developing scientific
grounded production. All these pave the way for combining efforts of scientists and
businessmen, their cooperation and sharing benefits by mutual consent. The institute is
collaborating with a number of enterprises and institutions in public sector along with the
private sector in implementation of the consolidated research plan. Good progress has
been made in establishing partnerships with Genetic Resources Institute, Research
Institute of Soil Sciences and Agro-chemistry (Academy of Sciences), regional branch
offices of Agrarian Science Center and other research institutes of Ministry of Agriculture.

Introduction

The development objective of the project was to further increase rural productivity and
incomes by enhancing the access of farmers and small and medium rural enterprises to
rural business and agricultural support services. It would be achieved through financial,
advisory and veterinary enhanced services and by stimulating market-oriented investments
in rural areas. The project cost estimated at US$57.7 million during appraisal has already
reached by June 30, 2011 to about US$64.2 million, including the reinvestment of funds
recuperated from the credit subcomponent. The PAD estimated project economic rate of
return (ERR) was 16.0%, and the net present value (NPV) of the project’s net benefit
stream, discounted at 12%, was US$4.1 million. The quantified incremental benefits used
in the PAD analysis were based on: (a) strengthened and expanded advisory services and
improved access to new adapted technologies; (b) strengthened and expanded veterinary
services; and (c) models of likely sub-projects to be implemented under the Competitive
Grant Scheme (CGS).

The evaluation at completion shows that the ERR is 20.5% and the NPV US$25.74
million. Investments in the Agricultural Advisory Services components are resulting in an
ERR of 18.5% and a NPV of US$8.3 million, while the Veterinary Services shows an
ERR of 34.8% and a NPV of US$3.7 million. The CGP show direct economic net benefits
with an ERR of 33.3% and a NPV of US$4.1 million. The support to medium and large
agribusiness through the project credit line channeled by financial intermediaries
(commercial Banks) is averaging an ERR of 19% with a NPV of US$9.6 million. All
assumptions used for this economic analysis were definitively conservative. The analysis
that is presented below confirms the financial and economic benefits stemming from
conditions developed by the project at the time of the ICR preparation.

Methodology

Since the initial project design and objective remained unchanged over the project
implementation period, the current analysis re-estimated the project benefits from the
strengthened and expanded advisory and veterinarian services, jointly with the improved
access to new adapted technologies following the appraisal methodology. Assumptions on
future yields were based on a conservative interpretation of the findings from the
Completion Evaluation Survey (CES). In addition, representative schemes and subprojects
actually supported under the CGP and the agribusiness loans through commercial banks
were analyzed. Actual performance in terms of production, services provided, costs and
revenues was updated with beneficiaries.

The financial analysis estimated some of the direct net incremental returns attributable to
the project by comparing returns in the without project (WOP) scenario and with project
(WP) scenario over 15 year project life (e.g., 2007-2023). The period of analysis allowed
accounting for the phasing and gestation period of the interventions. The net incremental
benefits were estimated at the crop/activity level and at the farm household level. The



                                            42
analysis was cross-checked with the results of the CES that has been conducted in the first
quarter of 2011 covering economic indicators and productivity for 2010. The financial
analysis used 2010 constant prices for all inputs and outputs for the entire project period.

In the economic analysis, the financial prices were converted into economic prices by
removing taxes and subsidies from prices. Non-tradable items were assumed to have a
conversion factor of 1. For the financial analysis, family labor was valued at AZM 10 per
day which might be considered above the existing level but is representative of the daily
agricultural wage during the peak season. A shadow wage rate of 0.7 was used to convert
the financial cost of labor to its opportunity cost. The Government’s hectare based direct
subsidies for crops were excluded from the financial and economic analyses and a 0.7
conversion factor for the price of wheat was used.

Agricultural and Veterinarian Support Services

Good progress was made during ADCP-II in expanding a responsive and decentralized
information and advisory system that reaches a large number of farmers and is having a
substantial impact. Yields for all major crops and livestock activities were assumed to
increase around 10% in the without project scenario, and by about 20% in the with project
scenario. At appraisal it was assumed that the total adoption rate would be 20% in the
project area. For this analysis it was considered that the project reach an adoption rate of
about 15% of the project areas. This might again underestimate the project impact and
coverage, but takes into account that other programs and projects are overlapping portions
of the ADCP areas, and that there is a natural trend of improvements that also would work
under the without-project scenario. This approach contributes to a more accurate
estimation of the incremental benefits deriving solely from Project activities. Anyway, a
sensitivity analysis considering the adoption rate reaching 10 and 20% of the farmers was
done and presented below.

Six activity crop models and budgets were prepared to represent the main crops and
livestock activities typical for the project area as well as the results being obtained with
the interventions implemented under the project. They all show increased income per
hectare or per animal production as a result of agricultural technology testing and
dissemination, and of improved veterinary services. Wheat (averaging irrigated and rain
fed conditions) was used to represent cereal crops, cotton representing industrial crops,
tomato for vegetables, apples for fruits and grapes, and alfalfa to represent all fodder crops.
A one cow/buffalo and a flock based on 3 ewes model was used to represent the project
areas’ livestock patterns and project results in the field of veterinary services. The
summary of these models are presented in Table 1, while the details can be found in
Working Paper (on file).

The analysis shows that activities in agricultural technology testing and dissemination,
together with the improved access to credit for small farmers have resulted in increased
incomes: the improved application of inputs and seeds on crops increased their yield by an
average 9.1% over what could be expected without the project, resulting in incremental
margins in a range from US$23/ha to US$355/ha or 5.4% to 204% increase over non

   beneficiaries. Improved veterinary and animal husbandry for cattle reduce mortality of
   adults and increase milk production in the participating farms from 1,100 to 1,200 liters
   per head per year, and meat from 110 to 120 kg on average. These improvements resulted
   in incremental benefits of almost US$20 per cow per year. Improved feeding and
   veterinary services for sheep also led to a reduced mortality of adults and to an increase in
   benefits per head or additional margins of US$5 per flock of 3 ewes. All detailed crop and
   activity budgets WOP and WP are present in the project working files (ADCP_Sep3.xls).

   Farm Models

   Three farm models of about 2 hectares were built to represent and quantify the financial
   benefit of the project on farmers’ family income. In the case of the beneficiaries of the
   agricultural services the increase in income was estimated to be 5%, from US$3,700 to
   US$3,890. The farmers benefiting from the PVU as regular clients would have an
   increase of 21%, from US$3,300 to US$4,150. In this case, the herd has increased from
   2.8 cows to 4.8 cows as shown in the CES while without project it showed an increase of
   only one cow. The third farm model shows the case of a farmer benefitting from both


                                                     44
types of project services, but without increasing his stock of animals as in the second
model. The family income in this case was estimated to grow by 6%, from US$3,326 to
US$3,925. Further details are shown in the working files.

In calculating the overall benefits from the advisory and research activities, the main
assumption at appraisal was that while an average coverage rate would be 50% (50% of
farmers were to be contacted by the end of the project in the project area), out of whom
about 40% would put knowledge into practice, thus resulting in a total adoption rate of
20%. The adoption rate used for this ICR analysis was 15%. This coverage reduction is
based on the fact that the advisory services were delayed in their start up, and by the
moment discontinued since mid 2011, waiting for the government decision to continue to
finance the program. In the case of the veterinarian services, it was assumed that the new
30 PVU are benefiting about 300 farmers each or 9,000 farmers in total, which represents
a coverage of about 2.1% of the livestock heads in the country. Based on the cultivated
area of representative crops in 2010 in the project area, and applying the assumed
adoption rates, the following volumes and value of benefits were derived for each of the
adoption models, or acreages of crops where farmers would be adopting improved farm
management technologies:

Based on the above assumptions, the annual incremental benefits from the agricultural
research and technology dissemination activities at full development (year 9 or 2016) are
estimated at around US$7.3 million, while the veterinarian services would be having
annual incremental benefits of US$1.7 million. Tables 3 and 4 show the detailed analysis
for the two sub-components in the agricultural and livestock sectors. The ERRs were
estimated at 18.5% and 34.8% and the NPVs at US$8.3 million and US$3.7 million
respectively.

Competitive Grants Program (CGP)

Schemes included introduction of better production technologies (drip irrigation); better
storage for grapes; improved handling and packing of vegetables, fruit and honey to
access higher value markets; canning of vegetables; processing milk into cheese; and
quality and safe slaughtering of animals. In each model, conservative assumptions
regarding returns and uptake were made.

The CGP was assessed through the analysis of 10 of the 74 supported schemes after a
selection process undertaken in four rounds completed in May 2011. The sample was
selected at random from the first two rounds for allowing results to be consolidated and
stabilized. Proponents were asked to update their scheme performance and a detailed cost
benefit analysis was prepared showing the value of improvements that were actually
achieved as a result of their CGS activities. Estimated financial Rates of Return ranged
from more than 40% to more than 100%, and their economic rates of return (ERRs)
ranged from 20.2% to 67%. Table 5 summarizes the results of the 10 sampled CGP cases
and Table 6 provides the weighted average of all CGP schemes, assuming the sample
represents adequately the type of activities supported by the program. The CGP his
showing an ERR of 33.3% and a NPV of the economic net benefits of US$4.1 million.

Agribusiness Credit Support through Commercial Banks

At appraisal the credit component was not included in the calculation of project benefits
because the probable loans for the different income generating activities could not be
known. By June 30, 2011, 99 subprojects have been financed with the original credit
allocation for medium and large agribusiness with US$15.53 million dollar in sub-loans
disbursed (about US$156,895 per sub-loan). Also, 13 additional loans were provided with
US$1.42 million recovered from the previous loans. A total of seven cases were selected
to represent the subcomponent which accounted for more than 26% of the project costs.
The seven credit schemes from the randomly selected sample included two schemes in the
animal breeding for meat and milk production sector; two schemes in the fruit orchard
production sector; one in the processing sector (fruit juices production); one in vegetable
sector involving greenhouse production for export; and the last one in the poultry and bee
keeping/honey sectors. Table 7 summarizes the main parameters resulting from the
updated performance of these sampled loans disbursed between 2008 and 2009.

The financial NPVs after financing for the various models ranged from US$22,324 to
US$333,927, while the ERRs ranged from 17% to more than 40%. Results show in all
cases: (i) a sufficient increase in gross and net returns for each of the schemes; (ii)
adequate financial and economic rates of return demonstrating the success of the
subcomponent; and (iii) extremely high loan recovery rates of more than 99%. Table 8
shows the overall subcomponent’s result by expanding the sampled cases according to the
share of each supported sector in the ADCP 2 credit for the agribusiness portfolio. The
weighted average result of aggregated net benefits shows an ERR of 19% and an
economic NPV of US$9.6 million.

The success of this subcomponent is also confirmed by the increase in investments in
fixed assets in the Azeri agricultural sector, that grew from AZM 58 million in 2006 to
AZM 431 million in 2010 (740% increase), while the same type of investments in the
overall economy grew from AZM 6.2 billion to AZM 9.9 billion (59%). As a consequence,
agricultural sector investments increased its share from 0.7% to 4.4% of total investments
in fixed assets. The project has contributed to this successful process by providing funds
earmarked for agriculture and providing training to banks, and demonstrating that the high
risk perceptions involved were not realistic. Commercial banks are now diverting their


                                           49
own funds to the agricultural sector, and at reasonable cost (6% – 13%). One of the
beneficiaries of the project’s credit line had obtained a US$1 million loan before the
project line was available in 2008 at an interest rate of 22%. The same borrower in 2009
obtained a project’s US$200 thousand loan at 12%, and in 2010 he accessed a third non-
project loan at 6%, showing that in only 3 years the access to agricultural commercial
long-term credit (5 to 7 years) in Azerbaijan has completely changed led by the ADCP-2
interventions. This change has been instrumental for the sector development, since 22%
interest rates were upholding investments as very few legal activities can afford those
huge costs.

Overall Project Results
The project as a whole is yielding a financial incremental net benefits with a NPV of
US$60.9 million and an IRR of 47.3%. The economic analysis demonstrate that the
project is generating an economic NPV of US$25.7 million and an ERR of 20.5%
reaching higher results than expected at appraisal (ERR 16% and NPV of US$4.1 million).
Results are shown in Table 9.

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis assessed the effects of variations in the coverage of the agricultural
services assumed to be 15% of farmers in the project areas. A fall in services coverage to
10% would reduce the estimated ERR to about 9.3% while if the coverage would have
reached the 20% of farmers in the project area assumed at appraisal, the ERR would result
in an ERR of 31%.

The Completion Evaluation Survey was held in administrative districts covered by
Nakhchivan AR, Masalli, Sheki, Ganja and Beylagan RACs. The survey covered three
groups: (i) farmer groups that had already taken part in ADCP-II and Special Interest
Groups (SIGs) formed from individual (household) farms within the project framework
since 2007; (ii) individual farmers (Flow-on Effects from ADCP-II groups) in ADCP-II
villages who were not covered by project; and (iii) some individual farmers not covered
by the project in the outer villages (External Environment Impacts groups). Information
was collected in the first quarter of 2011 and covered economic indicators and
productivity for 2010.

The CES was carried out in accordance with the requirements in the terms of reference. 72
farmer groups were selected from 69 villages in the 5 regions for CES. The average size
of each group was 14.65 persons.

Out of the 1052 respondents, 883 (83.9%) were men and (16.1%) were women. Although
in the EEE and FOE groups men prevailed, the number of women in the EEE groups was
higher, at 1/3rd of the total respondents. Overall, 66.8% were family heads (74.2% men
and 28.4% women). 95% of the respondents were married and 3.8% were single.

62.8 % of the respondents made profits from only their private farms, while 28.8% made a
profit from own-farm and from non-farm activities. 5.8% made profits from own farm
and also worked on other farms. (See CES 2011 for the regional breakdown of these
variables.)

Of the CES respondents, 93.5% indicated having used individual services of ADCP-II
while 92.8% had derived benefits from group services. With respect to farmer satisfaction
with the different components of services, the majority of respondents who used PAs and
RACs noted that they were either satisfied or highly satisfied. Altogether 13.7% of the
farmers did not derive profits from any services from ADCP-II during the last 2 years.
For comparison purposes, the corresponding figure in the interim Survey carried out in
2008 was 17.2%.

Farmers reported impressive increases in agricultural production as a result of PA/RAC
services, with 22%, 55% and 2.7% of respondents indicating increases of between 1-10%,
10-25% and greater than 25% respectively compared to 2006.

With respect to Private Veterinary Services (PVS), 85.8% of farmers had used PVS. The
majority of the 14.2% who did not use the opportunities of PVS stated that they had no
need for the services. Farmers who used the PVS reported satisfaction and productivity
increases, with 36.3%, 26.1% and 10.3% of farmers indicating production increases of
between 1-10%, 10-25% and greater than 25% respectively compared to 2006. The highly

satisfied farmers were in Nakchivan, Masalli and Sheki. The highest increases in
productivity were in Masalli and Nakchivan districts. Only 0.2% of the respondents
experienced ‘no increase’ in productivity.

One of the main components of ADCP-II was credit. Initial research on ADCP’s
participants had shown that farmers have a need for credit and they were users of credit
components of projects. Farmers who obtained credit through Credit Unions (CUs)
comprised 47.7 %, compared to 37.8% in the IS in 2008/09. 62.2% of farmers did not use
CUs. The majority of those who did not use CUs listed high interest rates (listed by
19.3% of the respondents), too short a loan period (15.3) and BG/CU services not
available in the village (6.5) as the reasons. The greatest increases in production attributed
to opportunities created through the use of CU services were in Nakchivan. Though the
use of CU services was low in Masalli and Ganga, the services still resulted in increases in
production averaging 15%.

With regard to the use of credit, the results attained in 2011 were similar to the patter seen
in the IS in 2009 - farmers who wanted to get credit were mostly involved in activities
related to livestock, compared to needing credit for the purchase of cropping seeds and
agricultural inputs (fertilizer, chemical substances etc.)

The SIGs established in the framework of ADCP-II sell their cultivated crops in different
ways. The marketing channels used are presented in Table 6.5 of the CES. New local
markets, local traders and regional markets are the channels used mostly. Farmers also
consume a significant part of their production or sell (give) these products to neighboring
farmers. The marketing channels used for sale of livestock products are similar to those
used in the sale of crops.

Previous studies in ADCP districts have shown that cattle-breeding is a rapidly developing
area in districts. According to the results of CES (see Table 8.1 in CES), the increase in
the livestock assets of ADCP-II groups was much greater than seen in FOE and EEE
groups. The greatest increase from 2006 to 2010 was seen in the categories, ‘Cows and
Buffalo’ and ‘Sheep and Goats’.

As for the technological methods used in cattle-breeding, the number of farmers using
“systems used by most? (the most accepted method) was higher in ADCP SIGs relative to
FOE and EEE groups. Though the number of farmers engaged in livestock husbandry
through “the best, advanced method? is lower, there were no farmers who engaged in
these methods in the FOE and EEE groups.

The main crops cultivated by farmers are grain, legume, fruits and vegetables.

The CES indicates that farmers get seeds and seedlings mainly from local markets and
neighboring farmers. The number of farmers getting seeds and seedlings from specialized
research institutes and companies among ADCP/SIGs is greater than seen among EEE and
FOE groups. Perhaps because of this, the number of farmers who are satisfied with the
quality of seedlings and seeds among ADCP/SIGs is high. ADCP groups use high quality
reproductive seeds than EEE and FOE groups and they are more prepared in technical and
natural difficulties during the cultivation and harvesting. Due to the use of improved seeds
in comparison to old seeds during the cultivation of wheat, barley, maize and pulse ADCP
groups achieved greater increases in income and output. Productivity increased on
average by 46% and gained income increased by 26%.

One of the potential dangers that farmers engaged in cattle-breeding encounter is
brucellosis. Information regarding preparedness for this disease indicates that the majority
(93.5% of the 777 farmers) of cattle-breeders (96.1%) had their livestock passed
brucellosis control compared to 87.7% of EEE/FOE groups. 33.9 % out of 777 farmers
(who keep mainly small and large cattle) having a need for pasture have a chance of using


                                               56
     pastures. The chances of farmers from FOE and EEE groups using pastures are rather
     limited in relation to ADCP groups.

     Cultivation, livestock and in general the sale of agricultural products increased during the
     last 2 years. Table 3 presents the percentage of crop and livestock sold on the market.

     According to the results of the Interim Survey gained overall income of ADCP-II groups
     in 2010 constituted 4380146 AZN. Gained income of farmers only from agricultural
     activities constituted 3724392 AZN.

     Agricultural incomes increased by an amount of 390692 AZN from 2008 to 2010,
     representing an increase of 10.49%. Gross incomes (gained from all sources) increased by
     an amount of 7249000 AZN (16.55%). In general agricultural incomes of farmers during

 LETTER FROM THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, DATED FEBRUARY 8,
      2012 ADDRESSED TO THE WORLD BANK COUNTRY OFFICE


We appreciate your providing the draft Implementation Completion Report for the Second
Agricultural Development and Credit Project. On behalf of the Government, the Ministry
of Agriculture agrees with the assessment of the Project effectiveness presented in the ICR.
The report objectively reflects both positive and problematic issues being arisen in the
course of the Project implementation. On our side we as the Ministry of the Agriculture
have prepared this short report on the ADCP II which reflects our vision and feedback.

1.    The background, rationale and the scope of the Second Agricultural
Development and Credit Project (ADCP II)

One of the greatest challenges of economic management in the country is to diversify the
economy in the face of growing dependence on the oil sector. The Government of
Azerbaijan (GOA) recognizes that diversified development of the non-oil sector is a key
for generating jobs and equity and reducing poverty. Therefore, development of rural
areas is a priority for Azerbaijan with the agricultural sector being a key to this
development. The agricultural sector is the most important source of employment in
Azerbaijan. Summarizing all of the above mentioned issues and impacts on agricultural
sector is very important for diversification of economy, ensuring the food security and
reduction of rural poverty. In this aspect, the ADCP II was very much responsive in
achieving the development of agriculture and rural areas. The current development
strategies in Azerbaijan and their associated policies showed that the strategy, approach
and objectives of ADCP II were correct and relevant.

The very challenging objective of the ADCP II, which was to further increase rural
productivity and incomes by enhancing the access of farmers and small and medium rural
enterprises to rural business and agricultural support services including financial, advisory
and veterinary services and by stimulating market-oriented investments in rural areas,
according to the realized outcomes and results of the independent surveys was adequately
achieved.

The most important key factors of successful implementation of the ADCP II were the
following: (a) the ADCP II was built on achievements of ADCP 1 and lessons learned
from ADCP 1 other donor activities in the country; (b) the good coordination, relevance
and integration between Project components and subcomponents; (c) the full commitment
and strong interest of the Government and of all implementing agencies; (d)
implementation of some Project activities gained momentum in cooperation between
public and private sector and (e) very good cooperation between World Bank and
Azerbaijan Government (during both preparation and implementation) (f) relevance with
Government Development Strategies and Programs.



                                            60
2.       Achievements and outcomes of the Project / Sustainability of the Project

The Ministry of Agriculture on behalf of the Government of Azerbaijan rates the project
effectiveness as satisfactory. Overall the ADCP II has achieved its development objectives
and positively contributed to the socio-economic development of the country. Thus
achievement by the Project of its main two Project Development Objective indicators
concerning the increase of income and production marketed for cash of farmers
substantiate this statement. Moreover within the major three Project components the
following main outcomes and impacts have been realized and achieved:

     •   The project has certainly succeed in expanding the outreach of Credit Unions
         network to more communities and building capacity of supported Credit Unions;
     •   Participatory Commercial Banks’ (PSBs) disbursements completed within the first
         two years of deployment of the project Credit Line and started to use allocations of
         the revolving fund. This proves that commercial banks became interested in
         crediting agricultural sector and showed interest to continue financing agricultural
         sector. Therefore it could be considered as a very positive impact of the project.
         PFBs have financed a broad range of sub-sectors to ensure the appropriate
         diversification of portfolio;
     •   By means of 74 competitive grants, project has introduced, tested and transferred
         new and improved technologies with emphasis of better market accessibility,
         storage and small-scale processing;
     •   The project modernized and reformed the NRICH and its research plan and
         provided to farmers the better access to adapted technologies. For present time the
         scientists and staffs of the Institute are working in a very nice and fully equipped
         building. By means of conducted in collaboration by the Institute and RACs on-
         farm demonstrations the performance of new varieties, efficient agronomic
         practices, water-saving technologies, conservation agriculture with wheat, barley,
         maize, chickpea and lentil both under irrigated and rain-fed farming systems was
         shown to local producers;
     •   The project succeeded in establishing and supporting the network of 10 Regional
         Advisory Centers (RACs) and 201 Village Training Rooms, which cover the
         whole country and provide effective role in delivering to local farmers’ advisory
         service alongside with Government extension institutions. RACs have obtained
         international experience through international technical assistance provided by the
         Project and modern facilities including the operational website has been provided.
     •   The Project gave very positive impetus to the development of Private Veterinary
         Practice in Azerbaijan and for present time there is a network successfully
         operational private veterinary units in Azerbaijan;
     •   Within the Pilot Brucellosis Program the significant information regarding the
         status of infection rate has been revealed and necessary actions including
         vaccination, serological survey with close collaboration with other line
         international projects have been carried out.
     •   One of the innovations of the Project was establishment of the National
         Veterinary Information System (AZVET), which now was fully operational in
         forty five rayons, including the brucellosis pilot regions.


                                             61
     •   The Veterinary Faculty of Azerbaijan State Agricultural University (AU-VF) was
         supported by the Project - created Private Veterinary Unit at the Faculty;
     •   Enhanced veterinary education capacities through submitting training materials
         prepared within the framework of the Project;
     •   One of the innovations of the Project was introduction of Market Information and
         Commerce Hub (MICH) by means of which farmers and entrepreneurs could
         easily obtain information regarding the agricultural products’ prices and realize the
         market information dissemination activities. We consider that the Project
         established very good base for the public involvement in this niche of agricultural
         business;
     •   And in general enhanced knowledge and skills of the stakeholders through
         implementation of training courses, seminars, workshops and other events for
         veterinary staff, health workers, and spokespersons from priority sectors.

It is important to stress that the specified outcomes and the overall objectives were
achieved in close and good collaboration between Azerbaijan Government and World
Bank. This approach has shown very good results as it has allowed introducing modern
practices respecting the local realities, coordination of all the activities in order to achieve
their highest effectiveness and to cover all the important issues.

3.       Lessons Learned

         (i)   International experience provided by experts (e.g. from FAO under the
               program) and from the World Bank (in preparation and during project
               supervision) are critical to knowledge development and dissemination of
               international practices;
         (ii) Designed appropriately, the Project provided a very good platform for sound
               dialogue between international technical assistance, national expert panels
               and local institutions which also enhances local capacity and ownership of
               outcomes. Project activities were also well-linked in terms of their
               implementation. For example, while advisory and extension services under
               Component 2 provided vital access for farmers to knowledge and technology
               in order to make informed investment decisions, the first Component
               increased the availability of rural financial services to farmers and small
               entrepreneurs for working capital requirements, long-term credit for
               investment purposes. However it is absolutely necessary to allocate more
               time and effort to design all Project interventions in order to ensure that the
               proposed arrangements are real, workable and realistically budgeted (in order
               to avoid in the future such case as it was with the establishment of the
               MICH);
         (iii) Engagement of private sector in future project implementation should also be
               considered as a priority issue;
         (iv) In order to ensure sustainability of obtained development trend it is
               absolutely necessary to improve capacity of local implementing partners. As
               it was successfully achieved in the cases of NRICH, SVS, PVUs and PFIs



                                              62
       within the ADCP II. This will be real driving force for the future
       improvement and efficiency increase in their respective operations;
(v) For some particular activities such as future upgrade and modernization of
       the SVS and food quality and safety issues it is necessary to improve their
       respective regulatory and institutional basis;
(vi) The ADCP II proved that Private Veterinary Practice is very effective and
       efficient arrangement for the extension and development of Animal Health
       Service in general and Government should consider more targeted support to
       development of Private Veterinary Practice;
(vii) Taking into account that production aspect of agricultural in the country is
       adequately addressed by ADCP II, during the next phase of the Adaptable
       Program Lending the more emphasis should be placed on standards of
       production, marketing and processing aspect of agricultural sector;
(viii) Strengthening technological linkages and enhancing the dissemination of
       adapted technologies through reforming and equipping of NRICH proved to
       be very good experience and Government should build on this practice and
       replicate the same approach for the modernization of other agricultural
       research institutes;
(ix) The Project's flexibility is critical to ensure that enough flexibility to be built
       in to enable adjustments to be made as circumstances change.

 LETTER FROM THE MINISTER OF FINANCE, DATED FEBRUARY 17, 2012
          ADDRESSED TO THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER

       Re: Report on the results of the Agricultural Development and Credit Project-II

Implementation Completion and Results Report on the World Bank financed Agricultural
Development and Credit Project II which is nearing its completion Bank was reviewed
accordingly by the Ministry of Finance.

With regard to the points about delays by the Ministry of Finance in finalizing the Rural
Investment Guidelines and Four partite Agency Agreement for provision of loans to credit
unions and borrower groups, we would like to inform you that the Rural Investment
Guidelines deals with provision of commercial loans to agribusinesses, while the Four
partite Agency Agreement is a framework document governing provision of loans to
credit unions and borrower groups, and the Ministry has some suggestions and
recommendations concerning certain provisions of these documents such as loan
management arrangements, terms and conditions of loans, provision of collateral,
selection of agent banks, etc). Accordingly, detailed discussion of these aspects with the
implementing agency and the World Bank, and their incorporation in the Agency
Agreement and Guidelines took some time which had led to the said delay.

With regard to other statements in the report, we would like to inform that relatively high
proportion of the credit and counterpart financing went to piloting some agricultural
initiatives such as establishing regional advisory centers, borrower groups and credit
unions, rural private veterinary services. But the World Bank report contains a number of
criticisms concerning the above said activities.

We would like to suggest finding out and comprehensively analyzing very important
issues like the reasons why a quality of implementation, the current status and the
objectives of the referred activities have not been fully achieved, and the results achieved
after the implementation of these pilot activities and the ways of providing their
sustainability in our country and so on with the relevant agencies as well as preparing final
report accordingly.

 LETTER FROM THE MINISTER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, DATED
  FEBRUARY 21, 2012, ADDRESSED TO THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER


Re: Comments and Recommendations of the Ministry of Economic Development on the
      presented Report on the Agricultural Development and Credit Project II


1.      Preparation works of the proposed ADCP III is also included to the objectives of
the extension of the implementation period of the current ADCP II in the Restructuring
Section (Table H) on the 11th page of the presented Report. In this regards, we would like
to mention that we consider necessary to finance the preparation works of the new project
from the other sources.

2.       The agricultural sector was mentioned as the second largest sector after oil in
2004 (para 2 of sub-section 1.1). In this regard, we would like to mention that the
agricultural sector was the 3rd one (after oil and construction sectors) in that period, and
the fourth one at present (after oil, construction and trade sectors). We would suggest
verification of statistical information with the relevant government institutions while
collecting data on the country.

3.      The dependence of poor rural families on own consumption in Azerbaijan was
assessed as 65% in the 2nd paragraph of the same Section. We consider necessary to give
us information about how this indicator has been estimated by the Bank.

4.     The 31th paragraph of Section 2.5 of the Document stipulates that the works of the
proposed ADCP III will be based on the experience gained in ADCP II. We suggest
organizing the Joint Working Team consisting of the representatives of the related
agencies while preparing the new project in order to prevent the repetition of difficulties
experienced under ADCP II (Credit Component, Regional Advisory Centers, and Market
Support Service) in the proposed project.

5.       The achievement of the Project Development Objective was assessed as
satisfactory and the progress in many areas was emphasized in para 59 of Section 3.4 of
the Report. The monitoring visit of the Ministry of Economic Development and Bank
representatives to Goychay, Agdash and Barda districts was organized by the PMU on
September 12-14, 2011 and the information about the positive and negative instances
occurred during the project implementation was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers with
the letter number IIN-X/O-1700/2011, dated November 15, 2011:

       •   The objective of the “Information and Advisory Services? subcomponent is to
           create opportunities for the farmers to improve quality and productivity of their
           products by expanding the outreach of the advisory services. The positive
           aspects such as regular participation of the advisors in the training courses in
           Regional Advisory Centers (RAC) and field demonstrations for farmers
           organized by advisors were observed. At the same time, the shortcomings such
           as few numbers of the contracts between private advisors and beneficiaries,


                                            65
    non-coordination of the RAC activity with the other components of the project
    were observed during the monitoring. The sustainability of the RAC activity
    was not ensured either. As a result, future activities of the RACs after the end
    of financing under the current project are under question.

•   The objective of the “Veterinary services? subcomponent is to develop private
    veterinary services, to expand the system of Private Veterinary Units and to
    create better conditions for the livestock owners to use high quality veterinary
    and livestock services in the country. The positive aspects like the extended
    variety and low prices of medicines, and participation of veterinaries in the
    training courses in Goychay and Agdash Private Veterinary Units were
    observed. In addition, insufficiency of workshops and training courses, as well
    as lack of professional veterinaries in districts can be assessed as deficiencies.

•   The objective of the “Competitive Grant Programs? subcomponent is to
    establish efficient rural markets through application of modernized
    mechanisms encouraging sustainable relationships among the developing rural
    enterpsies, agro-processors, and farmers. As a consequence of the monitoring
    held in Goychay the shortcomings like a bad infrastructure of the premise,
    where the equipment located (the infrastructure of the premise restricts full
    operation of the applied technology), lack of the appropriate electric cabling,
    financing of the project without establishing necessary pre-conditions, as well
    as non-operational equipment were identified. As a result of the assessment of
    the subcomponent in Barda district functioning equipment was defined as a
    positive side, but non-registration of the grant under the applicable regulations
    was identified as shortcoming.

•   The objective of the “Financial Services to Small Agro-Business/Credit Unions?
    subcomponent is to support rural businesses and business activities. As a result
    of the assessment in Agdash it was observed that though CU was established in
    1998 with 106 members, no funding from the Credit Implementing Agency
    (CIA) was made available to this CU. A large number of the granted loans
    from the funds of the CIA and a small number of overdue credits in Barda can
    be noted down as positive instances. Some Credit Unions do not know their
    rights and it is considered as a deficiency. We were informed during the
    discussion with the Credit Union that the collateral requirement for the loans
    up to 5000 AZN poses some difficulties. In particular, preparation of the
    collateral related documents requires some expenditure that makes 5000 AZN
    loan costly for people.

•   The objective of the “Market Support Program? is to provide the farmer
    products with the access to the markets and prevent the deceiving cases of
    farmers by resellers while selling their products. As a result of assessment in
    Barda participation of price collector in training courses is considered as
    positive side, but expensive Azercell customer services and lack of back up
    communication equipment can be identified as deficiency.


                                     66
•   Generally, lack of coordination among the project components has been
    observed. Thus, the farmers getting loans through the project’s “Agricultural
    Business Services Component? must be coordinated and benefit from the
    services rendered within the project’s “Agricultural Support Services
    Component?. At the same time, the supervision over financial subcomponents
    of the project must be strengthened and sound programming must be followed
    in providing the sustainability of advisory programs.
