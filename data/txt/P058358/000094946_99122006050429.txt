A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
Assist the Government of Solomon Islands to improve health outcomes of rural communities
through strengthening existing reproductive health and malaria programs, testing new approaches to
reducing these problems, and through improved planning, management and monitoring of priority health
programs.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Progress in achievement of the project objective would be assessed using the following key
performance indicators:
*   increased proportion of mothers receiving skilled care in pregnancy and childbirth
*   increased acceptance of effective contraception
*   reduction of hospital admissions and deaths from malaria
*   increased use of bed nets for prevention of malaria
*   improved health service utilization in the provinces
*   availability of good quality health program reports to stakeholders
*   successful completion of the project's defined learning program, incorporation of results into national
policy and dissemination to non-project areas
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: IDA/R93-70 (P-6000-SOL)                      Date of latest CAS discussion:
05/25/93
The World Bank's strategy for assistance to Solomon Islands, is summarized in Section II B (para.
27-30) of the Report and Recommendation of the President on the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) of
May 21 1999, approved by the Board on June 18, 1999. The strategy supports the Government's Policy
and Structural Reform Program (PSRP) and Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS). The MTDS
aims to improve governance and productivity in the public sector and promote human development through
ensuring (i) effective health services and (ii) a population growth rate in keeping with the country's
development aspirations. During preparation of the SAC, the World Bank's economic assessment team
identified the health sector as a high priority for support in the current financial crisis. In response, the
World Bank and the Solomon Islands Government reached agreement during the 1998 Annual Meetings to
prepare a health sector development project.
The Strategy Statement of the SAC also underlines the World Bank's intention to pay particular
attention to consultation and co-ordination with other development partners, and to ensure as far as possible
that World Bank activities will complement but not substitute for those of other donors.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector Issues. Despite improvement since independence in 1978, Solomon Islands ranks below
most other Pacific Island countries in overall health status. Infectious disease, especially malaria, and
maternal and infant conditions remain the dominant causes of mortality and morbidity. The incidence of
167 cases of malaria per thousand population in 1998 is the highest reported in the Asia Pacific region,
although this represents a drop of more than 70% since the peak in 1992. The maternal mortality ratio of
5.5 per thousand live births is also higher than other Pacific countries. Non-communicable diseases
constitute a small but increasing part of the disease burden.
The population growth rate of over 3.0% per annum is a major barrier to social and economic
development, but awareness of this issue is low among political and community leaders. With an estimated
total fertility rate of 5.4 births per woman and increasing numbers of women entering childbearing age, the
present population of about 420,000 is projected to increase 50% by 2011. Results of the 1999 census,
due early in 2000, will provide more accurate estimates. Acceptance of family planning is low (estimated
contraceptive prevalence of 8.5%) due to poor service provision as well as lack of information and
conservative community attitudes.
The Govermnent is the major provider of health services in Solomon Islands, in coordination with
church funded programs in some provinces. The small private health sector is confined to the capital city,
Honiara. Increasing population, declining skill levels of provincial staff, reduced supervision, unreliable
operating budgets and out of date equipment have led to reduced coverage and quality of health services in
the provinces. Communication between rural health centers and provincial hospitals for professional
support and consultation is unreliable. As a result of poor rural services and disproportionate allocation of
staff and funds to the National Referral Hospital, people who can afford it increasingly travel to Honiara
for care, which is an expensive and inefficient solution, and leaves most people inadequately served.
Health program constraints, particularly staff recruitment and operating funds, have been
aggravated by the current fiscal crisis. Although the health portion of the government budget has remained
relatively high in recent years (at about 13%), actual funds released in 1998 were 40 percent below the
budget. Inefficient distribution and use of available resources is partly due to the limited capacity of
MHMS for program planning and financial management. There is scope for better use of the private
sector, church facilities and other non-government agencies to conserve government funds and improve
service quality and coverage.
International funds make up about 35% of the public health budget, and are used particularly for
prevention and disease control programs. Coordination of the inputs from different agencies needs to be
improved, and also coordination with the Government's own planning and resource use.
The health system is facing a shortage of trained staff and inappropriate distribution, with unfilled
positions in key professions and in provincial health services.  The present recruitment of overseas
professionals, including volunteers, is not meeting the demand. Two barriers to effective use of the existing
staff are the shortage of operating funds and inappropriate public service working conditions.
In addition to problems with service provision, community factors also contribute to low demand
and low utilization of services. These include low educational levels, especially among women, and lack of
understanding of cultural and social factors in family decisions to seek care or take preventive action.
There is also very limited participation or mobilization of influential stakeholders from outside the health
sector in improving services. Sharing of information on program objectives and needs with political, civil
service and community leaders is infrequent, and there are no established arrangements for this purpose.
With some exceptions, health programs have been implemented with little systematic analysis of
performance problems, or objective testing of options for improvement. This may partly explain the low
-3 -



response to family planning efforts. Progress in malaria control since 1992 has been very good, but further
analysis and learning is needed to build on and sustain these gains. In summary, while commitment to
public funding of health programs has been strong, shortfalls and maldistribution of resources have
occurred and a concerted effort is needed to improve efficiency and sustainability of programs through
analysis of past experience and piloting of new interventions.
Government Strategy. The Government's Medium Term Development Strategy has the following
objectives for the health sector:
*   focus on primary health care as the main method for delivering of health services
* rationalize curative services through greater reliance on cost recovery, health workforce planning and
regular maintenance of facilities
*   improve partnerships in healthcare with churches, non-government organizations (NGOs), provincial
and local governments and community organizations
*   encourage development of a private healthcare market.
These objectives would be met through:
*   improving access to healthcare services and the quality of services
9  improving healthcare supervision and management, effective allocation and utilization of resources
*   improving the quality and amount of human resources available for delivery of health services
*   reducing the levels of morbidity and mortality in the country
*  promoting environmental health and family health education
* promoting maternal and child healthcare and family planning
=   developing partnerships for healthcare promotion
*   improving financial planning and management capacity in MHMS.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will assist with implementation of the Government's Medium Term Development
Strategy in health through strengthening provincial services in the high priority areas of reproductive health
and malaria control, while conducting pilots and studies of specific initiatives to improve the
cost-effectiveness and productivity of these programs, and enhancing capacity in the use of information for
health planning and management in the Ministry and in the provinces.
In accordance with the Government's policy of donor coordination and use of credit funds as a
supplement but not to replace grant funds, the scope of activities funded within the project framework will
be adjusted according to availability of support from other agencies, through twice yearly meetings of the
concerned agencies with MHMS.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The project has three substantive components covering: (A) improved reproductive health; (B)
improved malaria prevention and control; and, (C) capacity building in the MHMS and provincial health
services. A fourth component (D) comprises the project's coordination and support activities.
Component A. Improved Reproductive Health. In this component, MHMS will improve provincial
services for reproductive health, with special attention to the training of medical and nursing staff
-4 -



in-country and overseas, improved clinical supervision and upgrading of rural health facilities. A new
post-basic course for nurse-midwives will be piloted, with oversight by a representative committee on
midwifery services. International assessment and monitoring guidelines for reproductive health service
quality and use will be adapted. An intersectoral task force with provincial representation will provide
feedback to the Ministry on reproductive health matters. The project will fund the work of the task force,
staff training, clinical supervision and technical support, upgrading of health centers, staff housing and
training facilities and necessary equipment and supplies.
Component B. Improved Malaria Prevention and Control. This component will help to fill funding
gaps in the National Malaria Control Program, while improving analysis and monitoring of factors
affecting program success, and testing ways to improve program effectiveness. The project will support a
new intersectoral task force and fund pilot studies to improve community response and health service
effectiveness. These studies will be conducted by local professionals within an international training
program. Training, supervision and supplies to improve prevention and case management in health centers
will be provided. The project will fund incremental costs for program improvement; analysis of historical
information on malaria control; design and implementation of operational studies and related staff training;
and the evaluation and dissemination of the findings to policy makers and health managers.
Component C. Capacity Building.  To underpin the current public sector reform and reinforce the
impact and sustainability of the priority health programs, the project would increase the capacity of
MHMS and participating provinces in health planning, with emphasis on improvements in: (i) the health
management information system, (ii) monitoring, evaluation and research, and (iii) donor coordination.
The project would also provide support for central level strengthening and pilot new arrangements to
increase outreach and community participation.
Component D. Project Coordination and Management This component includes the operation of the
Project Coordination Committee, and the Project Coordination and Implementation Unit (PCIU), within the
Planning Unit of MHMS, which will provide the project support functions, including financial and
procurement management, and liaison with implementing units in MHMS and the provinces. The project
will fund the staff and operating costs and limited additional refurbishment and equipment.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project will be implemented within the Government's public sector reform program which
includes the reorganization of MHMS and the National Referral Hospital. The project will enable MHMS
particularly to strengthen its planning unit, and the supervisory role of Ministry and Provincial staff with
respect to rural services. The project will underpin the Government's policy objective of improving the
balance of service availability between rural and central services, through training and deployment of
skilled nursing staff and improved facilities for consultation and support of rural facilities.
3. Benefits and target population:
The primary beneficiaries of the project are those families in rural areas now facing a high burden
of disease in malaria and reproductive health, and inadequate prevention and control services. The
secondary beneficiaries are rural health staff who will be able to upgrade their skills and functional
capability through the project training programs and facilities upgrading. Provincial and Ministry health
managers will also benefit from the capacity building initiatives, which will improve planning, monitoring
and resource use in the sector.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The project will be implemented over a 5 year period, with a mid term review at the end of year 2.
The project will be implemented by MHMS, under the guidance of a Project Coordination Committee
(PCC), and managed by the Project Coordination and Implementation Unit (PCIU). The PCC, headed by
the Project Director, will include the Secretary, the two Under Secretaries and the Directors of Planning,
Reproductive Health, Health Education and the National Malaria Control Program in MHMS, as well as
the Health Directors of participating provinces. The PCIU, headed by the Project Coordinator and located
in the Planning Unit, will be responsible to the PCC for administration of procurement, financial
management and for liaison with relevant implementing units of MHMS, including Planning, Reproductive
Health, Health Education and Malaria Control Program, and with Provincial Health Directors (details in
Annex 6).
Provincial participation. The project is expected to be implemented in up to 4 provinces which
will join in stages during the first two years of the project, according to criteria for suitability and readiness
agreed at negotiations (see Annex 2). The activity program for the first province, Makira Ulawa, was
included in the project appraisal.
Financial Management. The project's financial management system (FMS) has been prepared
after analysis of project needs and assessment of the experience of International Development Association
(IDA) supported education projects in Solomon Islands. It consists of accounting, financial reporting and
disbursement procedures, in line with the current Government system (details in Annex 6). Financial
management will be carried out by the project accountant in the PCIU, with additional technical support for
tasks such as reconciliation and preparation of consolidated reports in line with the requirements of OP
10.02. In the first year of project implementation, a review will be conducted on the feasibility of adapting
the project's financial reporting procedures to the Bank's Project Management Report (PMR) based
reporting requirements. Annual work plans and budget estimates will be provided to the Department of
Finance and Department of Development Planning for the allocation of counterpart funds. The PCIU will
also be responsible for project procurement and the authorization of project expenditures.
The PCIU will maintain project accounting records, on a cash basis, for each source of funding,
for activities executed at the central and provincial levels. All relevant supporting documents will be kept
- 6 -



for annual audit and random inspection by Bank missions. The project accountant will provide financial
reports on a quarterly basis, and integrate these reports into the project's annual progress reports. The
accountant will also be responsible for operation and replenishment of the Special Account for the IDA
Credit.
The project accounts report will be submitted by the PCIU to the Office of the Auditor General or
other qualified auditors acceptable to the IDA, for annual financial audit. Such audits will also cover the
Special Account and the Statements of Expenditure (SOE). The audit reports will be submitted to IDA
each year, within six months after the fiscal year's closing date.
Project Monitoring. The Planning Unit of MHMS will be responsible to the PCC for monitoring
the progress of the project, with assistance of the PCIU. The Planning Unit will (i) ensure that systems are
in place to monitor project components; (ii) define standards for data collection recording and analysis; (iii)
provide assistance to other units of MHMS and the provinces, and (iv) ensure that progress in
implementation is adequately documented throughout the project. The status of each component will be
reviewed at quarterly meetings of the PCC, which will focus on progress in implementation and adjustment
of schedules or scope as necessary. An annual review of project status, in the second quarter of each year,
will also include information on: (i) output and impact indicators; (ii) evaluation reports of pilot studies;
and (iii) results of baseline, mid-term and final evaluation where appropriate.
Monitoring and evaluation of the project form an integral part of the strategy to strengthen the
planning and management capacity of MHMS within Component C. This component supports the other
components by ensuring information on the status of health services is available and analyzed, and that
some relevant information subsystems are strengthened. Some additional data will be collected to fill gaps
in the existing system and to support implementation and evaluation of pilot studies, but, as far as possible,
project activities and outputs will be monitored through the routine information systems of MHMS.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The project design has been modified since identification through (a) changing the lending
instrument; (b) streamlining project components; (c) change of provincial participation; and, (d) adjustment
of funding in relation to other donors.
(a) The project was designed, with full support of MHMS, as a learning and innovation loan
(LIL). The project's learning program includes analysis of past experience, a series of studies and pilots to
provide insights on which to build more effective and sustainable health programs, and capacity building
for monitoring and evaluation. However, the Government's request for a five year implementation period,
based on inexperience in implementation and time needed to achieve behavior change, could not be
accommodated within the Bank's present guidelines for a LIL. Nevertheless the project has retained its
emphasis on learning and innovation, and its original learning timetable, along with a small supplementary
grant fund to assist MHMS in monitoring and evaluation.
(b) The initial project concept included a separate provincial level component, envisaged to
support a resource plan for each participating province. This was removed because it caused confusion in
assigning activities between core program components and the provincial component. However, all new
construction must be consistent with strategic planning for each province. The risk of vertical, unrelated
activities taking place in a province is reduced by making the provincial health director responsible for
- 7 -



coordinating and monitoring all project activities in his or her province, and by making progress reports
available to the provincial government.
(c) The planned participation of Guadalcanal province in the project has been deferred due to civil
unrest. The situation will be reviewed regularly and if possible the project will assist with rebuilding
essential services in this province.
(d) The balance of activities planned under the project has been altered by availability of funds
from other donors. It was agreed at appraisal that, for the first year and possibly for the longer term: (i) the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide the main support for health promotion capacity building in
MHMS, including production of communication materials for use in the project; and (ii) the Australian
Agency for International Development (AusAID) will provide technical support for the Health Planning
Unit of MHMS, except for the development and use of health management information system (HMIS) and
the donor coordination function, supported by the project. The three agencies concerned (ADB, AusAID
and World Bank) along with the New Zealand Overseas Development Agency (NZODA), and MHMS
have confirmed their intent to consult twice yearly on progress in their respective initiatives, with the
prospect of further adjustment, should other grant become available, as the Government and Bank
management have agreed that the Bank will be funder of last resort.
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed,
ongoing and planned). The World Bank has no previous projects in the sector.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
This is the first project in the health sector in Solomon Islands to be supported by the World Bank.
However, lessons from health projects in comparable countries and from education projects in the Pacific
include the following:
(a)   allowance must be made for inexperience and limited capacity in project;
(b)   donor coordination in the sector is a high priority, with provision to adjust financing arrangements
as other funds become available;
(c)   in a relatively unpredictable social environment, flexible arrangements are needed for timing and
scope of subprojects including province participation; and
(d)   effective monitoring, learning and dissemination arrangements must be incorporated in the project
design, and supported with technical assistance.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
(a) The project is listed in the Solomon Islands Government's Development Budget.
(b) The project has been approved by the Cabinet.
(c) The Makira Ulawa Provincial Government has approved the project.
(d) The Project Preparation Committee (PPC) of MHMS has worked consistently for over one year on the
preparation of the project and maintained the work schedule with few delays, caused by events outside the
control of the Ministry.
(e) The PPC provided active partners for all consultants engaged to assist in analysis and preparation.
(f) Provincial premiers and health staff have also shown strong commitment for project participation.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank is providing:
(a) funding support for the public provision of essential rural health services during a time of budgetary
constraint;
(b) substantial grant funding for technical support in project preparation, supervision and monitoring;
(c) a new approach to external support of the health sector, with initiative in project preparation from the
Ministry (i.e.,with the client in the driving seat), and encouraging a clear but flexible framework with
emphasis on learning and improvement of the existing system;
(d) assistance to MHMS to improve donor coordination;
(e) increased possibilities of international contacts for research and training (with WHIO); and,
(f) stronger emphasis on analysis of economic and cost-effectiveness aspects of program design.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
O Cost benefit    NPV=US$ million; ERR = %
* Cost effectiveness
O Other (specify)
The cost-effectiveness of project expenditures is estimated in terms of discounted healthy life years
(DHLY), for Component A (Improved Reproductive Health) and cost per malaria case averted for
Component B (Improved Malaria Prevention and Control). The analysis investigates the rationale for
investing in learning and development activities in improving reproductive health and reducing malaria in
9-



Solomon Islands both during the project period and beyond. It compares the cost-effectiveness of two
categories of activities supported by the project: Category I: strengthening of existing health sector
operations; and Category 11: learning and innovation through analysis of past program performance and
piloting of new or enhanced methods for reducing selected priority health problems.
Under the central and most likely assumptions, strengthening existing activities will sustain the
Government's achievements for the five-year duration of the project, averting maternal and infant deaths at
about US$ 384 per DHLY gained in comparison to the approximate costs of a year of healthy life to the
country of US$ 930 (assuming that the value of a year of healthy life in Solomon Islands is approximately
equal to its per capita GDP) and malaria cases at about US$ 5.80 per case, a substantial bargain in
comparison to the approximate cost of the case to the country of US$ 465 (assuming each case of malaria
costs approximately one half year of healthy life). In comparison, the benefits of the learning activities in
each component while being less certain, are potentially much higher and could reduce the cost per DHLY
gained (by averting maternal and infant deaths) by 44% and the cost of averting a malaria case by 10% to
20%. The analysis also shows that if benefits accrued under the project are retained after project
completion, they would improve the efficiency and effectiveness and lower the costs of existing services.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):    NPV=US$ million; FRR = %
Fiscal Impact. Incremental recurrent costs generated by the project are expected to be small, both
in terms of project expenditure and as a proportion of the current health budget. In view of the projected
rapid population growth rate (doubling in 20 years), the health budget would need to grow substantially,
even to maintain the present per capital allocation. If this occurs, the proportion of the health budget
required to maintain program improvements resulting from the project would be even smaller.
The main incremental recurrent costs incurred by the provinces as a result of the project include
operation and maintenance of new and refurbished health facilities and additional staff housing, and costs
associated with additional outreach and home visits, supervision and inservice training. It is assumed that
refurbishment of facilities would not increase maintenance costs and would reduce them during the first ten
years. It is estimate that additional maintenance costs would be less than 2% of the allocated health budget
for the participating provinces, and could be sustained after project completion. Modest additional
program operating costs are expected to bring a substantial increase in the productivity of staff posted in
rural areas, through allowing them to increase the number of patient and family contacts per staff member.
In addition, it is expected that additional resources for provincial health services would become available
as a result of the Government's initiative to improve the organization and financial management of the
National Referral Hospital.
Adequate and timely release of provincial health service grants will be essential to ensure the
sustainability of project interventions. These allocations were delayed during the financial crisis of
1997-98, but since April, 1999 all provinces have been receiving their allocated health budget on time.
The project will support a one year pilot of the Government's proposed new midwifery training
program and construction of facilities for that program. The Government would provide all operating costs
of the training program after the first year, including approximately US$1,000 per annum for operation and
maintenance of the new facilities. The responsible Government agency will be requested to provide
evidence of budget allocation for the operation and maintenance of the new facilities before construction
begins.
As the economic analysis indicates, learning activities supported by the project in the two priority
-1 0 -



health programs - reproductive health, and malaria prevention and control - are expected to identify ways
to improve the cost-effectiveness of the current programs.
The project will also help the Government strengthen its planning framework for capital investment
and improve resource allocation in the health sector, including better use of funds from other international
agencies. A phased approach to province participation and project support for needs analysis for each
provinces will also help ensure that the investment choices made will help to keep the program affordable
and commensurate with available resources.
3. Technical:
The current national programs in reproductive health and malaria prevention and control, which
will be supported by the project, have been analyzed by technically qualified experts, and are considered to
be appropriate and up to date. There is a high standard of technical leadership in these programs within
MHMS and in WHO. Enhancements to be included in the project are in line with international experience
and particularly the experience of countries with similar settings and health problems, and include specific
pilots and training for adaptation to local conditions. Where new approaches are proposed, they will be
tested first through properly designed and monitored pilot studies. Proposed enhancements to the HMIS
have likewise been included after exhaustive analysis of the current situation by qualified national and
international experts, and are adapted to the specific country situation.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies:
Solomon Islands has experience with IDA funded education projects and since May 1999, has
begun to implement a Structural Adjustment Credit. However this project will be the first IDA supported
project implemented by MHMS. The Government organizational structure and public service functions,
including financial management, are undergoing reform and downsizing. As noted, MHMS has shown a
high level of ownership and commitment to this project and has experience in implementing other donor
supported projects. The key implementing units, the National Malaria Control Program and the
Reproductive Health Unit, have a track record of managing projects, despite limited middle management
staff. The new planning unit is yet to be assessed.
b. Project management:
The management of the learning program, including the monitoring and evaluation of the
substantive components will be integrated as far as possible with the routine monitoring and information
management functions of MHMS. Capacity building in these areas is an objective of the project, and this
arrangement will reduce duplication of monitoring functions in a small Ministry and enhance the
sustainability of the improvements introduced. Technical support to MHMS will help to ensure that the
learning program of the project is completed, as well as transferring skills to local staff.
MHMS has maintained effective working relationships with several development partners in
implementing health program improvements. However relationships with institutional stakeholders and
community leaders in the country appear to be ad hoc, with some missed opportunities for consultation and
mobilization of support for health initiatives. The project will assist MHMS establish intersectoral task
forces for the reproductive health and malaria control programs, and will improve the quality and
distribution of reporting by MHMS on these programs.
- 11 -



5. Social:
Preliminary social analysis for the project included review of assessments and strategies used in
other projects, informal household visits, focus group discussions with representative beneficiary groups
and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders (see table in E.7 below). The analysis confirmed the
influence of social factors on the country's main health problems and population growth rate. These factors
include: (a) inadequate knowledge and awareness among both men and women, due to low education levels,
limited reach and effectiveness of health education activities; the physical isolation of many communities
and difficult access to electronic media; (b) the secondary status of women in both community and family
decision making, which affects utilization of health and family planning services and also advocacy for
service improvements; and, (c) conservative attitudes of some cormmunity groups.
There are many groups in Solomon Islands with current or potential involvement in health education
and health promotion. These organizations, including non-government agencies and churches, participate
actively in community development at both national and local levels. Some areas also have functioning
village committees and health volunteers. Further analysis will be conducted during this project and a
related project to be supported by Asian Development Bank, to improve understanding of the barriers to
effective health behavior and use of services; this will help in design of pilot activities to change behavior
and increase demand for services.
Land Acquisition and Resettlenent. All Government land in Solomon Islands is purchased;
therefore issues of involuntary land acquisition or resettlement do not apply. Construction and upgrading
of health facilities and related structures appraised so far will take place on land owned by the Government
and allocated for the purpose by the Government. For additional civil works identified during project
implementation, the same situation is expected to apply. Evidence of appropriate acquisition of required
land will be a disbursement condition for civil works under the project.
Indigenous people. The intended beneficiaries of the project are those families and commnunities
in the participating provinces in need of preventive and curative care in reproductive health and malaria
control, regardless of ethnic or cultural background. As virtually all these beneficiaries are indigenous
Solomon Islands people, the Borrower is not required to prepare an indigenous peoples' development plan
for the project, as noted in paragraph 13 of Operational Directive (OD) 4.20. The following elements of
project preparation and design address the provisions of OD 4.20:
(a)    Specialist advice. During project preparation, technical assistance with inquiry on cultural issues
and design of the participation and communication activities of the project was contributed by three social
scientists, one with extensive experience of community based development initiatives in Solomon Islands,
one expert in health promotion among indigenous groups in other countries and a participation expert
provided to the team by the Bank's East Asia and Pacific Social and Environmental Unit.
(b)    Consultation during preparation. Consultations and focus group discussions were held during
project preparation with families and with community and church representatives in the project areas, as
well as mission and government staff working in rural health services.
(c)    Monitoring of impact. The project is expected to have no adverse impact on the cultural integrity
and traditional social practices of the beneficiaries. As described in Section E.5 above and E.7 below, the
project design includes a comprehensive participation framework to ensure continued consultation and
exchange of views on project initiatives and progress, including the views of beneficiary groups.
- 12-



(d)    Access to Project Benefits. In Solomon Islands, the majority indigenous Melanesian population
and the small, long established Polynesian and Micronesian groups which make up the rural population,
live in essentially similar circumstances. All provinces likely to participate in the project have a proportion
of residents from other provinces. In order to monitor access to service improvements and other benefits of
the project amongst different beneficiary groups, community satisfaction surveys will be conducted as part
of the baseline, mid-term and final reviews, including a question on island of origin/ethnic group. The
results of these surveys will help to ensure access to project benefits according to need.
(e)    Potential Contribution of the Project to Improved Equity of Social Development. Solomon Islands
is currently experiencing social unrest, including population movement, related to perceived unequal
participation of different island communities in the country's social and economic development. The
Government considers that the project has the potential to improve access to essential health programs in
underserved communities, and expects to prepare for these areas to participate in the project.
6. Environmental assessment:              Environmnent Category: C
The project is expected to have no appreciable environmental impact.
7. Participatory Approach (key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced or may
influence; if participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable):
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
Through consultations and focus groups, primary beneficiaries have expressed their
preferences and needs related to the project objectives, and helped in identifying barriers to access
and problems with service acceptability, as well as main communication channels and the role of
different formal and informal leaders. Consultations will continue during implementation, to
exchange views on the design and implementation of specific activities, including selection and
testing of communication messages, monitoring of progress and assessment of service
improvements.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Consultations were held with a range of stakeholders during preparation, to establish
existing programs and levels of support from various agencies, to hear the priorities of different
groups and to begin mobilization of support for the project. During implementation it is planned
to continue consultations around both project plans and progress reports of each project
component, as noted in the framework.
A framework for participation is outlined in the following pages, including the activities
and mechanisms and level of participation for different stakeholder groups during preparation,
implementation and monitoring and evaluation of the project.

The sustainability of project benefits is analyzed in terms of health benefits, fiscal impact, and
institutional and social support for continuation of program improvements after the project.
(a) Sustainability of health benefits. As for other social or human capital investments, any health
improvements (or illness or disability averted) accruing to individuals, adults and children, as a result of
the project's improvement of health programs for rural families, will benefit the health and productivity of
those individuals for their lifetime, regardless of the availability of the programs for others in the future.
Likewise training provided to health professionals, managers and scientists through the project will provide
lasting professional development to those individuals and increase the pool of expertise available for health
development of the country.
(b) Fiscal Impact. Incremental recurrent costs generated by the project are expected to be small,
both in terms of project expenditure and as a proportion of the current health budget. (see section E.2)
(c) Institutional and social support. The National and Provincial Governments in Solomon Islands
have a long tradition of support for health programs, and this has been reinforced in the reform program of
the current Government. The linkage of the health project to broader economic and public sector reforms is
mutually reinforcing, and offers a clear advantage over a more isolated investment in a single sector. While
there are underlying risks of continuing civil unrest, provision of essential health services are a demand of
disenchanted and displaced groups, and response to this demand can assist in maintaining social cohesion.
The generation of civil society's continued support of the project's strategies and programs is being
addressed by instituting mechanisms to increase stakeholder involvement in the design, implementation and
monitoring of the project. Learning activities of the project will also identify mechanisms to encourage
community participation and behavior change.

Annex 2: Project Description
SOLOMON ISLANDS: HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
Introduction
The aim of the project is to contribute to the Government's goals of improvement in health status
of the people, and of keeping population growth in line with national development aspirations. The
objective of the project is to assist the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) to improve
reproductive health and to reduce illness and deaths from malaria, through strengthening essential aspects
of the current health programs and a program of specific learning activities to improve program coverage,
effectiveness, acceptability and utilization (see Annex I for the project design summary).
This annex contains brief comments on three factors influencing project design and
implementation, followed by a description of each project component and a summary of the monitoring and
evaluation arrangements. The annex has two attachments: a summary of learning activities, and the
learning timetable for the project.
Factors Affecting Project Design and Implementation
Public Sector Reform. The project will be implemented concurrently with the national public sector
reform program, which includes reorganization of MHMS and the National Referral Hospital (NRH).
Project success will be affected by the nature and progress of the reform. The new organizational structure
of MHMS, when fully implemented, will provide the basis for improved capacity needed for sustainable
project success, especially in health planning, human resource management, financial management and
health promotion.
Donor Coordination. While the objectives and main strategies for each project component have
been identified, the scope of activities funded by the project will depend on availability of support from
other agencies, including multilaterals ADB, WHO and UNFPA, bilateral partners such as AusAID,
NZODA and the Government of Japan, and non-government organizations such as Rotary. The project
will assist MHMS to coordinate twice yearly in-country consultations among development partners,
including an annual plan review, to confirm the availability of funding and technical assistance for the
following year. The World Bank would be a funder of last resort, but would guarantee core funds for all
activities agreed in the project.
At project appraisal, MHMS received commitments for immediate substantial technical assistance
in health planning from AusAID, and in health promotion from ADB. Both agencies have proposed project
support in these areas beginning in year I of the project. Agreement was therefore reached to exclude these
specific activities from the project budget.
Provincial Participation. Many project activities in reproductive health and malaria control,
including training and improved planning and management, will strengthen the programs for the whole
country. Pilots and other specific activities will be implemented in selected provinces on a phased basis.
Provinces will be selected to participate in the project on the basis of according to need and readiness.
Criteria for provincial participation include: (a) need for support in the program areas supported by the
project, (b) strong leadership in provincial health service, with provincial health director and senior nursing
positions filled, and (c) commitment of the provincial government to support the project objectives and
- 25 -



implementation arrangements, within national planning guidelines and in accordance with project
requirements.
Agreement was reached with the Government that Makira Ulawa province will join the project on
appraisal. Participation of Guadalcanal province has been deferred due to civil unrest, and its readiness to
join the project will be reviewed at the end of year 1. Possible participation of other provinces, based on
emerging needs and fund availability, will be assessed on request of the Government.
Project Components
Project activities are grouped into 3 substantive components with a fourth component for project
management. Components A. (Improved Reproductive Health ) and B. (Improved Malaria Control and
Prevention) address two major national health priorities; Component C (Capacity Building) will strengthen
MHMS and provincial capacity in Health Planning (with special emphasis on the management and use of
health information) with limited support for health promotion. Component D (Project Coordination and
Management) covers the work of the Project Coordination and Implementation Unit (PCIU) and Project
Coordination Committee.
By Component:
Project Component 1 - US$2.16 million
Component A. Improved Reproductive Health. The objective of this component is to improve
reproductive health through enhanced coverage and quality of reproductive health services. The project
will give special attention to the training and deployment of local professional staff, improved clinical
supervision, and pilots to increase service outreach and community participation. The three
sub-components will: strengthen institutional arrangements; upgrade service coverage and quality in the
provinces; and increase the availability and distribution of trained staff.
Sub-component 1: Upgrade service coverage and quality. The following innovations will be introduced to
improve service delivery in participating provinces: (a) adapt and use international guidelines and standards
for assessment and monitoring of availability and use of obstetric and family planning services; (b) improve
supervision and support of first level workers, through use of supervision checklists, radio consultation and
supplemental resources for staff visits and (c) improve outreach by health workers through use of a family
health card which has been successfully tested in one province. Selected health centers will be upgraded
and additional transport and accommodation provided for staff. An intersectoral task force will be set up
to improve communication with non-health sector stakeholders and provincial community leaders.
Sub-component 2: Increase professional skills training and distribution. Based on a new human resource
plan for reproductive health, the project will support an intensive effort improve midwifery, obstetric and
family planning skills. The project will help the School of Nursing in the Solomon Islands College of
Higher Education (SICHE) to establish a midwifery training program, based in the National Referral
Hospital and associated provincial hospitals. Overseas training fellowships will be provided for medical
and nursing staff. The distance learning program for nurses will be improved. The project will also
support some costs for overseas health staff to fill provincial posts while national officers are being trained.
Project Component 2 - US$1.35 million
Component B. Improved Malaria Prevention and Control. This component will help fill funding gaps
- 26 -



in the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) while analyzing past experience and testing ways to
improve the cost effectiveness of the Program. There are four sub-components: (i) enhanced support to a
basic package of malaria control activities; (ii) strengthened monitoring and evaluation of malaria control
in coordination with MHMS monitoring and evaluation efforts; (iii) pilots of specific enhancements of the
malaria program in five groups of villages; and (iv) dissemination of results for policy and program
improvements.
Sub-Component 1: Enhanced support to malaria control activities. The project would provide enhanced
support for key activities of the successful malaria control program in participating provinces, including
case detection and treatment, provision of bed nets and focal spraying to reduce mosquito populations. An
intersectoral task force will be set up to improve communication with non-health sector stakeholders and
provincial community leaders.
Sub-Component 2: Strengthened monitoring and evaluation. The project will strengthen the ability of the
NMCP to use information to manage its program, in coordination with other MHMS monitoring and
evaluation initiatives, and to learn more about individual, household and community aspects of malaria
control. The sub-component includes (a) analysis of historical data, (b) creation of a supplementary data
management team and (c) collection of population-based information about behavior and attitudes relevant
to malaria control. Activities (a), (c) and part of (b) will province will serve the learning objectives of the
project and will be completed by the end of the project. The management information system activity (b)
will be evaluated and adjusted at the end of the project to meet the day-to-day needs of the national
program, as a part of the overall health management information system (see below).
Sub-Component 3: Pilots of specific enhancements of NMCP. To improve knowledge of malaria control
the project will test up to five enhancements to the current control program. The enhancements will be
designed through collaboration of SIG staff with experts from WHO, World Bank and other international
agencies, to test the effectiveness of new incentives and procedures for individuals, communities and health
workers to improve prevention and control of malaria. The studies will be conducted in a program of
international post graduate study for up five eligible local professional staff, with oversight of the MHMS
Research and Ethics Committee. The project would finance the local costs of the studies and also tuition
costs for Solomon Islands researchers, if not available from other sources.
Sub-Component 4: Dissemination of results for policy and program improvements. The project will
finance dissemination of study findings at two stages; (a) a workshop at roughly the halfway point in the
project, to discuss lessons learned to date, and decide on province wide expansion of the best performing
enhancements; and, (b) at the end of the project, when results will be disseminated to national stakeholders
through a national malaria conference and related activities and publications, and to international audiences
through articles and conference presentations.
Project Component 3 - US$ 0.37 million
Component C. Capacity Building. To support the current public sector reform and reinforce the impact
and sustainability of the priority programs, the project will help to increase the capacity of MHMS and
participating provinces in: (a) health planning and management, with emphasis on (i) the health
management information system, (ii) monitoring, evaluation and research, and (iii) donor coordination; and
(b) health promotion and education, with emphasis on improved effectiveness of health promotion in the
priority program areas, and testing ways to improve outreach and community participation.
Suh-component 1: Health Planning. The new Planning Unit of the reorganized MHMS will be responsible
- 27 -



for collecting, analyzing and disseminating information to assist a range of user groups with planning and
monitoring of health programs (both routine and one-off) and assessment of trends in health problems.
This component will improve MHMS capacity in relation to the health sector as a whole and also in
relation to the project itself. It will assist MHMS to use its data to inform key stakeholders and to promote
accountability in service delivery. The project will support activities to (a) improve the development and
use of the health management information system (HMIS), (b) monitor and evaluate both routine and
special programs and initiatives, and (c) coordinate support from donors and other development partners.
(a)    Development and Use of the HMIS includes information system development, improved
production and dissemination of reports and use of the data to improve accountability and stakeholder
support.
(i) Information System Development: New administrative structures will be established and staff
trained in HMIS including a short study tour, the elements of the system (hardware, software and
management procedures) will be assembled and put into use; standards for data collection and recording
will be introduced; skills at national and provincial level will be upgraded through site visits and training;
and some specific data bases will be strengthened and integrated into planning, e.g. health service
infrastructure, vital registration and inpatient information.
(ii) Data Analysis for Planning & Monitoring: This group of activities will ensure that data from
routine information systems, administrative records, surveys and from the national census are analyzed,
disseminated and used in service planning and monitoring. It will set up a central repository of information
within MHMS, encourage regular presentation, publication and review of health service statistics, and
ensure they are provided to decision makers inside and outside the health sector (including elected
representatives, community groups and the general public).
(b)    Monitoring and Evaluation.
(i) The MHMS Research and Ethics Committee will be assisted to play an active role in oversight
and coordination of study and research initiatives, and dissemination of study findings for policy
development and program improvement. This role will cover the studies and pilots included in the project.
(ii) Project Monitoring and Reporting. Monitoring of progress in the project itself will be the
responsibility of the Planning unit, with a coordinating role for the PCIU (component D). This will include
baseline and regular progress reports, the mid term review and final evaluation.
(c)    Donor Coordination. The project will assist MHMS to establish the capacity and procedures and
capacity to liaise effectively with all technical and funding agencies supporting the health sector, through
ensuring a budget for a competent officer in this role, and for regular planning and review meetings in line
with the Government's own planning cycle.
Sub-component 2: Health Promotion. The health promotion function in the reorganized MHMS will be
assisted through: (i) essential capacity building based on a comprehensive performance review and needs
assessment in the first six months of the project. It is expected to include improved planning procedures,
technical assistance, training and some equipment. (ii) development and implementation of communication
strategies to support components A and B, and (iii) implementation of up to 3 pilot initiatives to strengthen
coordination with local NGOs and increase community participation in improving the utilization of health
programs. ADB has identified health promotion as a priority activity for technical assistance and project
support. Possibilities on sharing of this support with ADB have been discussed and will continue.

Project Component 4 - US$0.52 million
Component D. Project Coordination and Management. A Project Coordination and Implementation
Unit (PCIU) will be established in the Planning Unit of MHMS to provide the project support functions and
liaise with implementing units within the Ministry and the provinces. The unit, which will take over from
the project preparation unit, will be responsible for financial management, non-technical procurement
functions and support to implementing units for activities funded by the project. The unit will serve as the
secretariat for the Project Coordination Committee and the Project Director, and will handle
communications with World Bank and other agencies on behalf of the project. The project will fund the
staff and operating costs of the PCIU, and limited additional refurbishment and equipment.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
Routine Monitoring
Routine monitoring of the project will be coordinated by the Planning Unit of MHMS which will
(i) ensure that systems are in place to monitor project components; (ii) define standards for data collection
recording and analysis; (iii) provide assistance to other sections of MHMS; and, (iv) ensure that progress in
implementation is adequately documented through the life-cycle of the project.
The status of each component will be reviewed at quarterly meetings of the Project Coordination
Committee. Such meetings will focus on the implementation of activities and any needed adjustments to
schedules or scope. They will also consider the results of pilot studies when available. A formal review of
project status will be held annually (1 st or 2nd quarter of each year) which would also include information
on (i) output and impact indicators (ii) evaluation reports of pilot studies (iii) results of baseline, mid-term
and final evaluation where appropriate.
A set of 13 performance monitoring indicators have been agreed between IDA and the Borrower
for monitoring overall progress in the project. These will be included in the semi-annual progress reports
from MHMS to IDA, although some individual indicators will only be recorded once each year, and
discussed during the supervision missions. The indicators and their definitions, from Schedule 5 of the
DCA, are listed in Attachment 3 of this annex.
Project monitoring and evaluation will be an integral part of the planning and management function
of MHMS. Component C of the project, which will improve the systems and use of information for
program planning and monitoring, will also support monitoring of other components by ensuring that
information on the status of health services is available and analyzed and improving the information
sub-systems on health service infrastructure and inpatients. Some additional data collection is envisaged to
address gaps in existing systems and to obtain information for implementation and evaluation of pilot
studies. However, most activities and outputs will be monitored using the routine information systems of
MHMS.
Baseline, Mid-term and Final Evaluation
A baseline for the project, including the key performance indicators, will be established in the first
6 months of implementation, through data available in the present MHMS information system and through
the following activities:
Component A: An obstetric services survey will provide information on the availability and use of
- 29 -



obstetric services during the first and final years of the project. The survey will be used to define areas for
service improvement including staffing patterns, equipment and training.
Component B: Data on past malaria control activities, morbidity and mortality will be subjected to
rigorous analysis to establish disease trends and the effectiveness of control operations.
Component C: (a) Information on the status of health services will be reviewed in conjunction with the
new census data to establish five year trends in health service indicators. Existing information will be
supplemented with a survey of health service infrastructure and, in due course, a system to monitor
inpatient admissions (useful for routine monitoring obstetric services and malaria morbidity). The analysis
will enable MHMS to use data in policy formulation, planning and management of health services; (b) A
community needs assessment, including a review of health service utilization and community satisfaction
will be undertaken at the initiation of each pilot study. These will assist in the identification of priority
health needs and barriers to service utilization.
The baseline data collection will also include community satisfaction surveys, to allow monitoring
whether the benefits of the project reach all target communities according to need and regardless of
affiliation with any particular religious social or cultural group. These will be repeated at mid term and
final project evaluation.

Annex 4: Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
SOLOMON ISLANDS: HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
This annex presents the economic analysis for Solomon Islands Health Sector Development Project
(SIHSDP). Since the project is designed as a set of learning activities, the analysis was conducted in
accordance to Bank guidelines for economic analysis of Learning and Innovation Loans (LIL) and analyzes
the cost-effectiveness of the learning and development activities. A more in-depth economic and social
analysis of the project will be conducted as part of the learning during project implementation.
Summary of benefits and costs:
The analysis investigates the rationale for investing in learning and development activities in
improving reproductive health and reducing malaria in Solomon Islands both during the project period and
beyond. It compares the cost-effectiveness of two categories of activities supported by the project:
Category I: strengthening of existing health sector operations; and, Category II: learning and innovation
through analysis of past program performance and piloting of new or enhanced methods for reducing
selected priority health problems.
Under the central and most likely assumptions, strengthening existing activities will sustain the
SIG's achievements for the five-year duration of the project, averting maternal and infant deaths at about
US$ 384 per DHLY gained in comparison to the approximate costs of a year of healthy life to the country
of US$ 930 (based on the assumption that the value of a year of healthy life in Solomon Islands is
approximately equal to its per capita GDP) and malaria cases at about US$ 5.80 per case, a substantial
bargain in comparison to the approximate cost of the case to the country of US$ 465 (based on the
assumption that each case of malaria costs the country approximately one half year of healthy life). In
comparison, the benefits of the learning activities in each component while being more uncertain, has much
higher potential and will reduce the cost per DHLY gained (by averting maternal and infant deaths) by 44%
and reduce the cost of averting a malaria case by 10% to 20%. The analysis also shows that if learning
benefits accrued under the project are retained beyond project completion, it would improve the
cost-effectiveness of providing basic services for improving reproductive health and reducing malaria
incidence in the future by improving the efficiency and effectiveness and lowering the costs of existing
services.
Main Assumptions:
The costs and benefits of strengthening current activities (SES) are considered to be more
predictable than those for the learning activities, although the learning activities were selected on the basis
of expert analysis of the situation in Solomon Islands and experience of these initiatives elsewhere.
For each component separate estimates are made for incremental support to the program and for
the learning activities. (Annex 2 contains a full description of each component, and Annex 2, Attachment I
lists the project's learning activities). The estimates of cost-effectiveness for the learning activities relate
only to Solomon Islands. However, it is expected that some of the learning from the project would benefit
residents of other countries with similar health problems. These "external" benefits would justify additional
financial subsidies in the project including the terms of the IDA credit and some complementary grant
funding anticipated for these activities.
The analysis makes use of data from two provinces, Makira-Ulawa Province (MUP) and
Guadalcanal (GP). MUP will join the project after appraisal. GP's entry into the project has been deferred
- 36 -



due to civil unrest and will be kept under review. Participation of other provinces will be considered at
appraisal and during implementation, according to need and readiness. It should be noted that variations in
population density, geography and malaria incidence among provinces will affect the precision of
applicability of the analysis.
Cost-effectiveness indicators:
Component A: Improved Reproductive Health
Annex Table 4.1 presents the estimated costs and effects for MUP for the component. Data for
Category 1, strengthening of existing services (SES) include upgrading of the buildings and equipment of
health facilities, enhanced national midwifery training and overseas professional training. Data for
Category II, the learning activities (NEW) include the costs and benefits of initiatives to establish an
intersectoral task force, improve service quality and outreach and supervision, enhance distance education
for family planning.
Cost-effectiveness of SES Activities. The total cost of the SES category is estimated at SI$
5,636,237 (US$ 1,127,247) over the five-year project period. Of this, 41.4%, is expected to be financed by
the IDA credit, with the remainder from grants from other international donors. About 20% of the credit
(SI$ 1,127,247 or US$ 225,449) for this category is allocated to MUP, and the rest to other provinces.
The effect of the SES category will be to help Solomon Islands achieve its objective of a population growth
rate of 3.2% each year during the period 1996- 2010. In MUP, this would avert an estimated 10 maternal
deaths and 12 infant deaths, and also reduce maternal morbidity and the number of low birth weight babies
over the five-year project.
Is gaining one more year of healthy life a good investment at SI$ 1924 (US$ 384) per DHLY?
One way to examine this question is to consider the value to the country of the loss of a year of healthy life.
If we assume that the approximate cost of a year of healthy life in Solomon Islands is equivalent to the per
capita GDP of Solomon Islands, SI$ 4,650 (US$ 930), then it would be worthwhile to pay SI$ 1924 (US$
384) to avoid the loss of a year of healthy life (see Annex Figure 4.1).
Cost-effectiveness of Learning Activities. The estimated cost of the learning activities of this
component is SI$ 1,058,200 (US$ 211,640), entirely financed through World Bank credit; 24% of these
activities and their costs will be allocated to MUP. In addition, half of one of the health promotion activities
of Component C (see Annex 2) concerns Reproductive Health in MUP; therefore 50% of the estimated cost
for this activity (SI$ 216,500 (US$ 43,300) is included with the learning activities in Component A. Thus
the estimated total cost of this leaming sub-component is SI$ 470,470 (US$ 94,094) over the five year
project period.

'Population and its impact on human resource developmenf', Department of Planning and Development, November, 1998.
The effect of the project's leaming activities are difficult to predict. In the best case, the learning
will help SIG to achieve its lowest projected population growth rate, with an average of 2.9% each year
during the period 1996-2010. This best case would also avert six additional maternal deaths and 20
additional infant deaths in MUP over the project period and further reduce maternal morbidity and the
number of low birth weight babies. These effects would be in addition to the gains already made by SES
activities. Over the five years of the project, the best effect of the learning activities is that in contrast to
SES activities which result in a gain of 586 DHLYs at a cost of US$384 per DHLY gained, the learning
activities gain an additional 710 DHLYs at a cost of only SI$ 1233 (US$ 247) per DHLY gained for whole
MUP population. This would imply a total benefit of 1,296 DHLY gained at a cost of SI$ 1,233 (US$
247) per DHLY gained from the Reproductive Health component for the entire MUP population. In the
worst case scenario, these activities would achieve little or no benefit, and would not be continued or
disseminated after the project.

Sensitivity of the results to the impact of the learning activities. Annex Figure 4. 1 examines the
sensitivity of the cost-effectiveness of the learning activities to different assumptions of their impact on
maternal and infant deaths. The analysis shows that Solomon Islands would benefit from a project which
combines SES activities and learning activities as long as the combined project does not raise the cost per
DHLY gained above the cost per DHLY gained from just strengthening existing services, i.e. SI$ 1924
(US$ 3 84). On the other hand, if it turns out that no additional maternal and infant deaths can be reduced
from a project which combines learning activities with SES Activities compared to a project which contains
SES activities only, the additional investment in these learning activities will raise the cost per DHLY
gained by 42%, from SI$ 1924 (US$ 384) to SI$ 2,726 (US$ 545).

Impact of sustaining learning and innovation effects beyond the project period. By its very
nature, a five-year "learning project" must have benefits that extend beyond the lifetime of the project. In
this case, the benefits would be in improved cost-effectiveness of the existing Reproductive Health
program. In principle, the learning activities may be successful in demonstrating ways to achieve greater
reductions in maternal deaths and complications and increase family planning usage: (i) it could reduce the
number of maternal and infant deaths and the incidence of low-birth weight among babies without
increasing the cost of services above existing levels, (ii) it could result in maintaining future trends in health
indicators at levels achieved by the SES activities but at a lower cost for SES activities, or, (iii) both.
Annex Table 4.2 assumes that the benefits of activities in the learning category are sustained at least until
year 2010 and compares this with the scenario where the learning benefits are not continued after the
project period. The Table shows that if the expected benefits of the learning are sustained at least until
2010, 1168 additional DHLYs are gained between 2005 and 2010 at a cost of SI$ 2401 (US$ 480) per
DHLY gained. This indicates that investment in the learning activities would improve the cost
effectiveness of the existing Reproductive Health program beyond the project period by 40%.

c. Since the cost of the NEW sub-component ends with the project, this only includes the cost of maintaining existing services over the six-year

Component B: Malaria Prevention and Control
The activities of this component have also been grouped into (i) support for strengthening the
existing system (SES) and (ii) "learning" activities (NEW), including improved monitoring and analysis of
the current program, studies of innovations in malaria treatment and control, and dissemination of the
lessons learned from those studies. Annex Table 4.3 presents the estimates of the corresponding costs and
effects in two columns: "SES Category" and "NEW Category".
The analysis for this component uses data for two provinces, Makira Ulawa and Guadalcanal,
which have different levels of population density and malaria incidence. Half of the World Bank credit for
this component is assumed to be allocated to Makira Ulawa and half to the other provinces which will join
the project later. The potential benefits of the project have been estimated by assuming that they will
together have the population and the malaria epidemic profile of Guadalcanal Province.
Cost-effectiveness of SES Activities. The total cost of the SES activities is estimated at SI$
1,908,816 (US$ 38,176) per year or SI$ 9,544,080 (US$ 1,908,816) over the five years, of which
SI$3,042,760 (US$ 608,552) is financed by the project credit and S1$ 6,501,320 (US$ 1,300,264) is the
estimated value of SIG inputs, including staff salaries, amortized value of buildings and equipment, etc.
The effect of the SES sub-component will be to sustain the achievements of the Malaria Control Program
over the past 8 years, represented by the reduction of slide confirmed malaria incidence from 300 to 60 per
thousand in MUP and from 400 to 235 per thousand in GP. Assuming that there are four clinical cases for
-40 -



every slide-confirmed case in Makira-Ulawa and 2.5 clinical cases per slide-confirmed case in Guadalcanal
and the other provinces, the SES component can avert 65,973 cases in the first year of the project.
Assuming that the population size remains unchanged, the effect over the five years of the project lifetime
will be to avert a total of 329,865 cases of malaria. The cost per case of malaria averted by the SES
sub-component is thus SI$ 29 (US$ 5.80) per case. Furthermore, provided that the Government continues
to fully fund this strengthened system, malaria cases can be averted at SI$ 29 (US$ 5.80) per case for the
foreseeable future.

Is malaria control a good investment at SI$ 29 (US$ 5.80) per case averted? One way to examine
this question is to consider the value to the country of averting such a case. Suppose that in Solomon
Islands each case of malaria costs the country approximately one half year of healthy life. Since the per
capita GDP of the Solomon Islands is SI$ 4,650 (US$ 930), SI$29 (US$ 5.80) would be an inexpensive
-41 -



price to pay to avoid costs to the nation of as much as SI$ 2,325 (US$ 465).
Cost-effectiveness of Learning Activities. In the malaria component, most of the IDA credit
(73%) is allocated to learning activities. However, the results of the studies are expected to benefit not only
residents of the Solomon Islands, but other intended beneficiaries of the global Roll Back Malaria
Campaign. Therefore it is planned that only about half of the SI$ 17,249,020 (US$ 3,449,804) cost of the
learning activities would be financed by the borrower. The World Bank is working with Solomon Islands
and WHO malaria experts to obtain grant financing from other sources to fund SI$ 8,996,245 (US$
1,799,249), 52% of this total, leaving SI$ 8,252,775 (US$ 1,650,555) to be financed by the IDA credit and
counterpart funds.
The impact of the learning activities is less predictable than the impact of supporting existing
programs; however in the judgment of WHO and Bank malaria experts, the improvements to be tested have
the potential to reduce malaria incidence in the project areas by a further 50%. (The right-most column of
Annex Table 4.2 is constructed with this assumption.) If slide-confirmed cases drop from 60 to 30 in
Makira and from 235 to 118 in the other provinces, the learning activities could potentially avert 28,944
cases per year, when applied to all of both provinces. However, since it will take three years to perform the
studies and another six months to disseminate the lessons to the project provinces, these benefits would
accrue only during the last 18 months of the project's five year lifetime. Adding the 43,416 averted cases
accruing during these 18 months to the 329,865 cases averted by SES sub-component gives a total of
373,282 cases averted during the five years of the project.
If the learning activities are evaluated over the five year lifetime of the project, they appear to be
both expensive and risky. In contrast to the SES components, which avert 65,973 cases of malaria at
SI$29 (US$ 5.80) per case, the NEW sub-components avert only an additional 43,416 cases at a cost per
case to the Solomon Islands of SI$190 (US$ 38). While SI$190 (US$ 38) is still much less than the value
of half a healthy year of life, it is six times more expensive than the cases averted with the SES
components. One might ask, " Why not use the SI$8,252,775 (US$ 1,650,555) credit allocated to the NEW
sub-components in these provinces to malaria control using the existing systems in the rest of the Solomon
Islands or to other purposes altogether?
By its very nature, a "learning project" must have benefits that extend beyond the project lifetime.
In this case, the benefits of the NEW sub-components lie in the prospect of improving the cost-effectiveness
of the existing malaria control program. The studies proposed could either increase the effectiveness of the
program at current budget levels or they could decrease the cost of maintaining current incidence rates or
both. Annex Table 4.3 is computed under the assumption that the learning activities will halve the malaria
incidence rates at no increase in program costs. Panel A of Annex Table 4.4 applies the same assumption
to show that the NEW sub-components can benefit Solomon Islands by reducing the cost per case of
averting malaria from the end of the project into the foreseeable future.
The SI$ 8,252,775 (US$ 1,650,555) of the IDA credit, which is the cost to SIG of the NEW part
of the malaria component, is properly considered an investment in reducing the cost of averting malaria.
Panel A of Annex Table 4.4 computes the total annual cost of averting malaria in the provinces,
characterized in the previous table as the sum of the SI$ 1,908,816 (US$ 381,763) per year of the standard
program plus the "opportunity cost" of the SI$ 8,252,775 (US$ 1,650,555) World Bank credit for the
NEW part of the malaria component. The opportunity cost varies according to the assumed discount rate,
from a low estimate of SI$ 49,517 (US$ 9,903) per year, which is the interest at the 0.6% interest rate
charged for World Bank credits, to a high of SI$ 825,278 (US$ 165,055), which might be the cost to the
SIG of borrowing an equivalent amount from commercial lenders. Note that if the NEW sub-components
-42 -



succeed in further reducing malaria incidence by half, they will reduce the cost per averted case of malaria
even at the highest of these opportunity costs. If the annualized cost to SIG is only the 0.6% interest cost,
the learning activities promise to reduce the cost per case averted from SI$ 29 (US$ 5.80) to SI$ 21 (US$
4.20) for a percentage reduction of 29%. Using the intermediate interest cost of 3% as the annualized cost
to SIG, the cost per averted case would be reduced 21%  to SI$ 23 (US$ 4.60).

Notes
All amounts in Solomon Island dollars at Sl$5 per US$.
Panel A assumes that the learning activities will teach SI how to reduce incidence to half its current level at current cost and the
discount rate is 3%.
Panel B assumes the discount rate is 3% and the learning impact is permanent.
Panel C assumes the discount rate is 3% and the NEW activities will reduce malaria incidence by 50%.
Annual opportunity cost of the NEW is assumed to be the interest that the LIL investment by the GOSI would earn at the given
discount rate.
Sensitivity of Results to the Impact of the Learning Activities. Panels B and C of Annex Table
4.4 examine the impact on these calculations of alternative assumptions regarding the impact on malaria
incidence and length of the planning horizon. Panel B holds constant the assumed opportunity cost of the
NEW sub-component at 3% of the SI$ 8,252,775 (US$ 1,650,555) and the assumed perpetual impact of
the project to examine the sensitivity of the results to the assumption that incidence will be reduced by
-43 -



50%. Here we show that if incidence can be reduced even more, say by 90%, the cost would be reduced by
37% to SI$ 18 (US$ 3.60). The government would benefit even if malaria incidence is only reduced 25%.
On the other hand, if it turns out that malaria incidence cannot be reduced at all, the learning investment
will not have been worthwhile, since it will raise the cost per case averted from S1$ 29 (US$ 5.80) to SI$
32 (US$ 6.40), an increase of 13%.
Sensitivity of Results to the Planning Horizon. Panel C of Annex Table 4.4 holds constant the
assumed opportunity cost of the NEW sub-component at 3% and the assumed percent reduction in
incidence at 50% in order to analyze the sensitivity of the results to time horizon. The top row of Panel C
replicates the assumption that the benefits will persist indefinitely, as was assumed in the previous two
panels. Subsequent rows reduce the horizon, showing that the annualized cost of the SIG investment is
higher as the assumed longevity of the benefits declines. Under these assumptions, if the benefits of the
project become obsolete in less than twelve years the learning activities would not have been a worthwhile
investment for the Solomon Islands. While it is possible that a scientific breakthrough will produce an
effective malaria vaccine in ten years, the slow progress on such vaccines and the likely difficulty of
obtaining and distributing the vaccine once it is available suggest that it would be safer for the Solomon
Islands not to rely entirely on that occurrence.
Conclusion
In summary, under the central and most likely assumptions, the SES part of the both components
will sustain the SIG's achievements for the five-year duration of the project, averting maternal and infant
deaths at about SI$ 1924 (US$ 384) per DHLY gained in comparison to the approximate costs of a year of.
healthy life to the country of SI$ 4,650 (US$ 930) and malaria cases at about SI$29 (US$ 5.80) per case, a
substantial bargain in comparison to the approximate cost of the case to the country of SI$2,325 (US$
465). The benefits of the learning part of each component are more uncertain, but have high potential.
Under the best case scenario, the learning part of the maternal care component will reduce the cost per
DHLY gained by additional 44% and the learning part of the malaria component will reduce the cost of
averting a case by additional 10% to 20%. However, since the learning activities involve testing of new
approaches, the benefits they generate could be either greater or less than these estimates suggest.
Endnotes
1. "As with all Bank loans, an economic evaluation of costs and benefits of the LIL would be expected.
This would normally be in the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis of the learning and development
activities" (as quoted in LIL Guidelines for Completing the PAD).
2. Based on SIG's population projection scenario M3 as reported in "Population and its impact on human
resource development", Department of Planning and Development," November, 1998.
3. Calculated using life expectancy at birth of 63 years for infants and life expectancy at the mean
childbearing age (25 years) of 70 years for mothers discounted at a rate of 3%. Based on these
assumptions, averting an infant death would result in gaining 28 DIILYs and averting a maternal death
would result in gaining 25 DHLYs. It is to be noted that, life expectancy at birth is a conservative estimate
of the life expectancy of the children who survive as a direct benefit of the project since project itself would
increase the life expectancy at birth because of the infant mortality that is being averted as a result of the
project.
4. This result is calculated as SI$ 1,27247 (or US$ 225,449) divided by 586.
- 44 -



5. Based on SIG's most ambitious population projection scenario M4 are reported in "Population and its
impact on human resource development," Department of Planning and Development, November, 1998.
6. This result is calculated as 9,544,080 divided by 329,865. Holding expenditure and the incidence rates
fixed, population growth would decrease the cost per case averted. For population growth to increase the
cost per case averted, incidence rates would have to increase faster than the population. Thus, the
assumption of zero population growth is conservative.
7. The half year of healthy life lost is an average over infants, some of whom lose their entire lives and
adults, most of whom lose only a few days per episode. This estimate is derived by taking one fifth of the
value given in Ghana Health Assessment Project Team, "A Quantitative Method of Assessing the Health
Impact of Different Diseases in Less Developed Countries," International Journal of Epidemiology, Oxford
University Press, 1981.
8. One might argue that at SI$29 to avert a case of malaria, individuals would be willing to purchase
protection themselves. However, most of the cost of the successful SES sub-component has in the past
supported public sector vector control activities like spraying, the removal or treatment of breeding sites
and the dissemination of information. The country is currently experimenting with the distribution of
treated bed-nets as a possible substitute for some of these public activities. The bednets might seem to be
private goods, and thus less subject to market failure. However, to a degree which is subject to testing in
this project, bed-nets may generate substantial external benefits and therefore be appropriate targets of
public subsidy as well.
9. The "opportunity cost" of a resource is its value in its next best use. The opportunity cost of a World
Bank credit depends on its fungibility. If the credit would not have been available for any other purpose, its
opportunity cost equals the interest cost of the credit, or 0.6% per annum. If on the other hand, the funds
could have been allocated to any other purpose, the opportunity cost is the price the SIG must pay for
commercial loans perhaps as high as 10% per annum. In the case of the two components, the truth
probably lies somewhere between these two extremes.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
SOLOMON ISLANDS: HEALTH SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Procurement
Procurement Capability Assessment
There has been no Country Procurement Assessment Report for Solomon Islands. Contributions to
this procurement capability assessment were made by task team members, including a procurement
accredited operations officer, who have wide experience in procurement issues for health sector projects in
small, poor and isolated countries, including those in the Pacific. Detailed consultations were held with
relevant agencies in the country and with supervisors, implementers and beneficiaries of other IDA
supported projects in Solomon Islands.
The Financial Instructions (FI) issued by the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Solomon
Islands is the only country procurement guideline and is generally in line with the Bank's guidelines. Three
price quotations (except for proprietary items) and open competitive bidding have been allowed for
procurement of works, goods and services. Some health sector goods, such as drugs, supplies, simple
medical equipment, and vehicles are purchased through United Nations (UN) procurement agencies such as
WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNIDO, IAPSO. Chapter 20 of the Fl, paragraph 489, stipulates that
responsible procurement officers will comply with all obligations laid down by donors for Aid-funded
development projects.
The project implementing agency, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS), has no
prior experience with IDA supported projects, but has long and generally successful experience with
international shopping and local shopping for procurement of goods as well as procuring through UN
agencies as mentioned above. MHMS also has long experience of recruiting health professionals for short
and long term assignments through Government contracts and bilateral donor assistance, as well as through
volunteer schemes operated by the UN and by Australia, Japan, New Zealand, U.K. and U.S.
The experience of MHMS in managing large and small civil works projects funded by various
donor agencies has shown that success is related to (a) simplicity and clarity of procurement procedures,
(b) the quality and appropriateness of design and (c) intensive on-site supervision. There are clear lessons
from successful and unsuccessful implementation of civil works for health facilities, which have been
taken into account in procurement planning for this project. MHMS and provincial health authorities are
also aware of the difficulties faced in construction of small school sub projects, under the IDA supported
education and cyclone rehabilitation projects, and have stressed the importance of avoiding the same
problems in this project.
The Project Coordination and Implementation Unit (PCIU) has been established in MHIMS with
core staff of a Coordinator, Accountant and Implementation Officer. An administrative assistant and a
provincial project officer will be engaged during the first year of implementation. Procurement will be
coordinated by the implementation officer, under supervision of the Project Coordinator. Guidelines for
record keeping and progress reports on procurement have been drafted and these will be confirmed by
effectiveness. The action plan for establishing the required procurement capacity is provided below.
Based on the task team's assessment of limited management capacity, very limited capacity for
pre-financing, isolated location and unfavorable past experience in other sectors, the use of complicated
- 47 -



procurement procedures is considered to be of high risk. The project itself has low total disbursement ($4.0
million over 5 years). The procurement of goods, works and services needs to be coordinated and delivered
in some isolated locations. In order to minimize the risks the following steps were taken during appraisal:
(i) design and supervision consultant contracts have been incorporated in the civil works component, so as
to allow for a kind of consortium set-up with a firm proposing the best suitable team that meets the TORs;
(ii) well tested and well understood simple procurement procedures are allowed for procurement of goods
and works; (ii) the suitability of the prior review thresholds should help ensure smooth implementation; (iii)
Bank's Standard Bidding Documents including the Evaluation documents will be used; and, (iv) the
approval of an annual work plan, including procurement tasks, by IDA, takes the availability of funds from
other donor sources into consideration. The procurement methods selected for this project will meet both
the capacity of the implementing agency and needs of the project. The Bank's supervision team will
include external and internal technical experts to check the procurement aspect of the project during
implementation.

Procurement
All procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January 1995, revised in January and August
1996, September 1997 and January 1999 (the Guidelines). The procurement of consulting services will
follow procedures prescribed in the Guidelines on Selection and Employment of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers dated January 1997, revised in September 1997 and January 1999 (the Consultant
Guidelines). The procurement of consultant services will use the World Bank Standard Request for
Proposal Selection of Consultants, dated July 1997 and revised April 1998 and July 1999 and all
consultant contracts will use the Bank's Standard Forms of Contract for Consultant Services. Table A. I
summarizes the procurement arrangements under the project, and Table A.2 shows selection methods for
Consultant Services.

Civil Works (US$1,020,000 equivalent).
The project will finance new construction and upgrading of health centers, storage and staff
housing in participating provinces, a dormitory, staff housing and classroom facility for midwifery training
at the National Referral Hospital, and refurbishment of some office accommodation for MHMS in Honiara.
Many of these civil works will be in remote areas where access can be difficult, building materials are not
locally available and competent supervision is needed. The project will build on the successful experience
of the UK funded Rural Health Care Project (RHCP) implemented in the early 1 990s and reviewed in
1995, and will use or adapt the space norms, designs, specifications for materials and building technology
and supervision methods developed for the RHCP where design and supervision responsibilities were
assigned to consulting firms.
Civil works will be grouped into eleven construction packages, ranging from US$40,000 -
US$120,000. Construction contracts valued at or over US$50,000 will be procured through National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) using procedures acceptable to IDA, while contracts valued below US$50,000
and not anticipated to exceed US$100,000 in the aggregate may be procured on the basis of quotations
obtained from three qualified bidders. There is a large number of small construction contractors in
Solomon Islands; however there is no grading or other reliable evaluation of their capacity and
performance. Therefore, pre-qualification of bidders and performance bonds will be required for all
construction contracts. Preparation for the first two civil works packages started at appraisal and the steps
-49 -



to finalize them are included in the procurement plan.
Goods (US$1,020,000 equivalent)
Goods procured for the project will include office and simple medical equipment, vehicles including
canoes and a few cars, medical supplies, including small quantities of drugs, library materials and
consumables. Where possible, items such as vehicles and computers would be grouped into packages.
Based on project requirements, and our assessment of suppliers in Solomon Islands and current practice in
other small Pacific countries, it is expected that most of the goods will be procured in packages valued
below US$100,000, using international shopping procedures acceptable to IDA, based on evaluation of at
least three price quotations. Some general goods, including common medical supplies, spare parts etc.,
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 will be procured through national shopping procedures acceptable to
IDA, based on the evaluation of three price quotations, up to an aggregate of US$200,000. Where
appropriate, selected items such as vehicles, microscopes, bed nets and drugs including malaria drugs, may
be procured through the UN agencies in order to take advantage of volume discounts, for an aggregate of
US$300,000. The equipment list for the project, prepared by the Borrower, has been appraised and
included in the project implementation plan (PIP). The list will be adjusted as necessary during the
Mid-Term Review of the project. Because of the phased entry of project provinces we do not anticipate
any packages of over $100,000; therefore ICB would not be appropriate.
Consultants' Services (US$870,000 equivalent)
Technical assistance (TA) provided by individuals and firms, both local and international, will be
selected and contracted in accordance with the Bank's consultant guidelines. Most TA will be obtained
through individual Qontracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 each, using Selection Based on
Consultant Qualifications. Quality-based selection (QBS) will be used for some highly specialized
technical tasks for an aggregate of US$450,000, including TA for Component B (Improved Malaria
Prevention and Control) and engagement of consultant teams for design and supervision of civil works.
IDA will review annual plans for consultant services and their terms of reference.
Training, Studies and Workshops (US$1,100,000 equivalent)
This category includes overseas and local short term and long term training, study tours and
workshops for upgrading health professionals and managers, inservice for rural health workers, task force
briefings, and other learning and dissemination activities. Destinations for overseas training and study tours
will be selected on the basis of relevance and quality of programs, cost and prior experience, following
applicable govermnent and shortlisting procedures as described in the PIP. Training activities for each year
will be approved in the annual workplan for the project.
Incremental Operating Costs (US$390,000 equivalent)
This includes expenditures for travel and subsistence allowances for MHMS, project staff and
project participants, for project management, project implementation and supervision activities; and for
office consumables, supplies and communications expenditures for the PCIU, (excluding salaries), availed
of in accordance with Government administrative procedures acceptable to IDA.

Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Allocation of loan proceeds. The proposed credit of US$4.0 million equivalent would be
disbursed over a period of five years, up to the closing date of June 30, 2005. The allocation of credit
proceeds according to each expenditure category is shown in Table C. Retroactive financing will be
available for eligible expenditures incurred after October 31, 1999 up to a maximum of US$200,000.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursement will be fully documented for: (i)
contracts valued at or above US$100,000 for both goods and civil works; (ii) the first two contracts for
international and national shopping regardless of value; (iii) contracts valued at or above US$100,000 for
consulting firms; and (iv) individual consultant contracts valued at or above US$50,000. Disbursement
for all other expenditures, including incremental operating costs, will be against statements of expenditure,
with supporting documentation retained in the Project Coordination and Implementation Unit (PCIU) in
MHMS and made available for IDA review during supervision. SOEs will be subjected to an annual audit.
Special account:
Special Account A Special Account in US currency, with an allocation of US$ 200,000 will be
opened at the Central Bank of Solomon Islands in terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The initial
deposit would be US$ 100,000 until disbursed and committed amounts aggregate US$ 500,000. The
project accountant will submit applications for replenishment of the Special Account on a monthly basis, or
when the account is drawn down by 50 percent of the Special Account balance, whichever occurs first. In
addition to the supporting documents, PCIU will also retain copies of relevant supporting documents
against which applications for disbursement are prepared. The Special Account will be audited yearly.
Financial Management.
Internal Control System. The internal control system for the Project consists of project
management organization, policies and procedures. It will follow the existing government internal control
system comprising of (i) project organization, (b) accounting system, and (c) control procedures. In order
to meet the Bank's requirement (OP 10.02), an assessment of the financial management capability and
control environment of the project's implementing agency, MHMS, was carried out by consultants in
accordance with the Guide for Review and Design of Accounting and Reporting Systems for World Bank
Financed Projects, East Asia and Pacific Region, December, 1997. The weaknesses identified have been
addressed in the design of the Project Financial Management System which will be put in place in the
MHMS PCIU by project effectiveness. The action plan for the establishment of the financial management
system is in Annex 7, Table D.
Project Organization and Staffing. Overall direction and guidance for the project will be provided
by a Project Coordination Committee (PCC). The PCC will comprise senior staff of MHMS, including the
Secretary, the two Under Secretaries, the Directors of Planning, Reproductive Health, Health Education
and the Malaria Control Program, the Directors of Health of participating provinces, as well as
representatives of the Department of Finance and the Department of Development Planning. The Project
Director, nominated by MHMS and a member of the PCC, will have overall responsibility for
implementation of the project.
The PCIU, located in the Planning Unit of MHMS, will provide administrative support for project
- 53 -



implementation and coordinate with participating units within MHMS including Accounting, Planning,
Reproductive Health, Health Education and the National Malaria Control Program. The PCIU will be
responsible for procurement and financial management of the project, as well as coordination of planning,
supervision, reporting, monitoring and evaluation. The annual work plan will be prepared in coordination
with other donors and with the Government's budget and planning cycle.
Training has been arranged for PCC and PCIU on administrative and financial management, and a
time-bound action plan for strengthening financial management has been agreed between IDA and the
Borrower, to improve the financial management system, and provide quarterly management reports which
meet IDA requirements. Ongoing support will be provided to PCIU, especially at the beginning of the
project, through (i) provision of implementation guidelines; (ii) training on project administration and
management; and, (iii) regular technical support and supervision.
Accounting System And Procedures. As recommended in the financial management assessment,
the accounting function of the project will be located in the PCIU, and kept separate from the MHMS
accounting unit. The accounting system and procedures will follow the Government's official processes
and forms for budget, procurement, expenditures and reconciliation, and will comply with the Government's
statutory internal control procedures. In addition a simple computerized spreadsheet program will be
designed for compilation of monthly, quarterly and annual reports, as well as monthly Withdrawal
Applications required to replenish the Special Account. A specific project accounting system and
procedures will be designed and documented in the Project Financial Management System (FMS) manual
for use by the PCIU by project effectiveness. A consultant will be selected to design and implement the
financial management system of the project. An accounting firm will be selected using QBS to provide end
of month and end of year support to the PCIU during the first phase of the project.
Project Financial Reporting Requirements. The Project Coordinator in the PCIU will prepare a
consolidated progress report for provincial and central level, including the financial report, on a quarterly
basis, for submission to the MHMS and the Bank no later than one month after the end of the quarter. The
following reports will be produced according to the requirements of the Guide for Review and Design of
Accounting & Reporting Systems for World Bank Financed Projects, East Asia and Pacific Region,
December 1997:
Statement la: Summary of Source and Uses of Funds Report
Statement lb: Cost Variance Report

The action plan for implementation of the Project Financial Management System is in Table D,
below. In the first year of Project implementation, a review will be conducted to determine the feasibility of
- 54 -



adapting the Project's financial reporting procedures to the Bank's new PMR-based reporting
requirements. The Project Financial Management Report, Exposure Draft, February, 1999, will be used as
the Guideline.
