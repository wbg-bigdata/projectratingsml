F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project's principal objective in the PAD was to continue support for the
Government's energy sector reform effort and facilitate the sector's smooth transition to
the new market and institutional structure. The expectation was to see the emergence of
stronger power companies, policy and regulatory institutions, and increased private sector
and community participation, in all aspects of the electricity business. The project-term
outcomes included efficiency, supply and service improvements in the power sector,
demonstration of possible models to scale-up electricity access and preparatory work
required to launch the gas pipeline and related power generation projects. These
developments were expected to provide the enabling conditions for the emergence of a
competitive energy industry in Nigeria better equipped to contribute to growth and
improved delivery of socio-economic services. The Project was also responsive to the
GEF Operational Program No. 6, as it was designed to address barriers to the expanded
use of renewable energy technologies.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
I. To continue support for the Borrower's energy sector reform and key regulatory and
policy institutions; II. To increase efficiency in the power sector and to improve the
supply of electricity and service delivery; III. To demonstrate possible models to scale-up
electricity access; and IV. To continue support for the Borrower’s gas sector reform to
improve gas supply for power generation.

I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with a population of 162.5 million
(2012 estimate), of which a staggering 60 percent lives below the poverty line (2010
estimate). By dampening competitiveness, and thus employment opportunities, and
the ability for citizens to develop and sustain small businesses and increase
livelihoods, inefficiencies in and the poor performance of the power sector contribute
to the obstacles that Nigerians must face every day to escape the poverty trap.
2.      Despite being one of the largest economies in Africa and one of the most
significant oil producers, Nigeria continues to suffer from a chronic shortage of
generation, transmission, and distribution capacity. With approximately 4,300 MW of
available generation supplied through the grid against an estimated demand of 10,000
MW, Nigeria has considerable unmet demand. Deficiencies cause approximately 55
percent of the country’s population to live without access to electricity, and the
remaining 45 percent to suffer from poor quality of service, with multiple power cuts
each day (box 1).
Box 1. Issues Constraining the Sector at Appraisal (extracts from original PAD)
Utility’s poor performances. The National Electric Power Authority (NEPA, which evolved into the
current Power Holding Company of Nigeria [PHCN]) was responsible for four functions: generation,
transmission, distribution, and rural electrification. On the generation side, plant availability was low
and characterized by frequent outages. Dilapidated transmission and distribution networks caused high
energy losses. Poor service forced more than 90 percent of industrial customers and significant
numbers of residential consumers to install their own power generators, at a high cost to themselves
and the Nigerian economy.
Low access. Barely 40 percent of Nigerians had access to electricity services, with only 20 percent of
rural households able to access electricity. Given the significant cost to increase grid-based access to 75
percent of population by 2020 (over US$10 billion in investments), different and more efficient
electrification models were required, along with increased community participation.
Weak sector financials. On the business side, there was a large gap between power sold and power
billed, and between power billed and revenue collected. Lack of metering, outdated information
systems, and inconsistent billing practices were the principal causes of the severe revenue losses.
Electricity tariffs were not cost reflective, but tariff revisions were not considered possible unless
supply and service conditions measurably improved.
Absence of appropriate regulation. At the time of the National Energy Development Project (NEDP),
there was no independent price or service regulation for gas or electricity supply. In theory, the Federal
Ministry of Power and Steel was supposed to exercise regulatory powers, but it was not equipped to
discharge this function.

3.      The federal government of Nigeria (FGN) struggled for many years to find a
lasting solution to these problems. In 1999, FGN began putting together a
comprehensive program of sector reform and privatization to improve performance.
The Transmission Development Project (TDP), approved in 2001 and closed in 2008,
was designed to support the larger reform effort initiated by FGN. The National
Energy Development Project (NEDP) was launched in 2005 to scale up efforts to
address the urgent need for investments and improved commercial practices already
started under TDP.
4.     The Electric Power Sector Reform (EPSR) Act was the foundation for the
development and appraisal of the NEDP. The EPSR Act (2005) provided for
commercial operation of the sector and led to the restructuring of the existing power

                                                                                                         1
utility, the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), into separate generation,
transmission, and distribution companies. An interim holding company (Power
Holding Company of Nigeria [PHCN]) succeeded NEPA to oversee these companies,
awaiting privatization before being dissolved. The EPSR Act also established an
independent regulatory agency, the Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission
(NERC), to promote fair and equitable growth of the power sector, as well as a Rural
Electrification Agency (REA) to expand rural access. A Market Operator was also
established to provide a clearing house mechanism for public and private generation
companies to facilitate the sale of power.
5.      At the time of appraisal for NEDP, the World Bank was the only large
international development institution active in the sector. The Bank was able to
commit the scale of funding and the prolonged period for which it was required to
achieve visible impacts in a large country like Nigeria. Secondly, its staff had the
experience to address the key issues affecting the sector, such as reforms, utility
management, sector regulation, strategic communications, commercialization and
privatization of utilities. The Bank already had a long standing relationship with
NEPA and a well-established and performing Project Management Unit (PMU) with a
good track record. Finally, the successor companies were in need of substantial
financing from private sources, and the World Bank Group was uniquely positioned
in terms of its deep technical expertise and global knowledge to assist the government
in establishing the necessary conditions and environment to make this possible.
6.     NEDP was presented to the International Development Association (IDA)
Board of Executive Directors for approval as a flagship project along with the new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Nigeria, to which it was also fully aligned.
The CPS targeted long-term goals of wealth creation, employment generation, and
poverty reduction.
Context at restructuring
7.      Two main factors affected the sector context and eventually caused the project
to be restructured: the launch of National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) before the
general election in 2007, and the subsequent slowdown in reform momentum. In the
preelection climate in 2007, FGN felt strongly about a quick fix for the languishing
sector through the preparation and launch of NIPP. Under this program, FGN
allocated almost US$8 billion from its Excess Crude Account toward improving and
increasing generation capacity, transmission, gas piping, and distribution. Since the
preparation speed for NIPP left limited time for preparation of individual investment
components, the FGN program absorbed many of the investments and bid packages
appraised for NEDP, posing a challenge to the progress of NEDP implementation
(more details in section 2.2).
8.      Subsequent to the 2007 general elections, the new administration under
President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua comprehensively reviewed its sector strategy. In
2008, FGN, while continuing with reforms, decided to defer privatization of the
companies until improvements in power generation and efficiency could be attained.
These improvements were considered necessary to attract and sustain private
participation. Steps to address both generation capacity and sector efficiency were
launched. The Bank's assessment concluded that these measures would take time to
produce the desired results and therefore it would not be possible to achieve a
competitive energy industry structure within NEDP’s implementation period, even
within a reasonable extension of the closing date.

                                                                                    2
9.      The project was therefore restructured to consider NIPP and the shift in FGN
policy, with changes to components, project development objectives and indicators,
and to align these with the revisions in FGN’s strategy. In 2010, however, as the
administration of President Goodluck took over, the reform process gained
momentum again.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators
10.     This Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report uses the project
development objectives (PDOs) as stated in the financing agreement (FA) to assess
the project’s achievements:
   i.   to continue support for the borrower’s energy sector reform to facilitate a
        smooth transition to the new market and institutional structure;
 ii.    to increase efficiency in the power sector and to improve the supply of
        electricity and service delivery;
 iii.   to demonstrate possible models to scale up electricity access; and
 iv.    to continue support for the borrower’s gas sector reform to develop natural gas
        resources and related electricity projects.
11.    The original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) has a differently worded
PDO: The Project’s principal objective is to continue supporting the Government’s
energy sector reform effort and facilitate the sector’s smooth transition to the new
market and institutional structure. The expectation is to see the emergence of stronger
power companies, policy and regulatory institutions, and increased private sector and
community participation, in all aspects of the electricity business. The project-term
outcomes include efficiency, supply and service improvements in the power sector,
demonstration of possible models to scale-up electricity access and preparatory work
required to launch the gas pipeline and related power generation project. These
developments are expected to provide the enabling conditions for the emergence of a
competitive energy industry in Nigeria that is better equipped to contribute to growth
and improved delivery of socio-economic services.
12.     Main indicators to monitor progress toward outcomes included:
   i.   Reforms and sector wide indicators: Include the (a) emergence of new
        institutions in the form of NERC, successor electricity companies, the REA,
        and the Rural Electrification Fund; (b) development of workable private
        participation models in a few companies and/or clusters; (c) launch of access
        expansion pilots; (d) analytical inputs to establish rational and efficient
        domestic energy pricing structure; and (e) higher voltage level reliability
        indices for transmission.
 ii.    Cluster-level indicators: Improved technical/commercial efficiency and
        customer service quality indicators for distribution; improved values of
        standard financial indicators; and number of new consumers connected.
 iii.   Qualitative measures: Will include periodic customer satisfaction surveys,
        visual inspections, site visits, and feedback from civil society in formal and in
        informal settings.
13.     The project was blended with a Global Environmental Facility (GEF) grant of
US$1 million and was also responsive to the GEF Operational Program No. 6,
because it targeted barriers to the expanded use of renewable energy technologies by
creating an enabling environment for grid-connected and off-grid renewable energy

                                                                                       3
sources. The envisaged outcomes were closely linked to two strategic priorities for the
climate change focal area: (i) inputs to develop a power sector regulatory framework
and policies for renewable energy promotion; and (ii) innovative interfaces to other
development and investment efforts that require an energy supply, for example, in
agriculture, water supply, rural small, and microenterprises, education, and public
health.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
14.        During the restructuring in June 2010, the PDO was revised as follows:
      i.   to continue support for the FGN’s energy sector reform and key regulatory and
           policy institutions;
    ii.    to increase efficiency in the power sector and to improve the supply of
           electricity and service delivery;
    iii.   to demonstrate possible models to scale up electricity access; and
    iv.    to continue support for the FGN gas sector reform to improve gas supply for
           power generation.
15.     The restructuring was not carried out to address major shortcomings in project
implementation, but to ensure continuity in project activities in a changing external
environment. While the differences in the PDO statements might seem minor by
dropping “to facilitate a smooth transition to the new market and institutional
structure? and substituting “to develop natural gas resources and related electricity
projects? with “to improve gas supply for power generation,? the new PDO narrowed
the scope of the project and delinked it from broad reform outcomes outside the
project’s influence. The corresponding indicators were aligned to the changes in the
PDO:
      i.   Reforms and sector-level indicators: No changes were carried out for the
           indicators regarding the creation of new institutions. Targets were, however,
           modified to reflect the reduced scope of the transmission-related investments.
           Indicators pertaining to “customers connected? and “reduction in cost of
           connection? were dropped because it was proposed that off-grid models be
           restricted to renewable energy pilots and there were no available baseline data.
    ii.    Cluster-level indicators: Indicators have been limited to improvements in
           quality of supply, which will occur directly on account of project investments.
           Those pertaining to “number of customers connected? and “revenue
           enhancement? have been dropped because they also depend upon
           improvements in power generation and availability, which are exogenous to
           the project and have not materialized.
    iii.   Other changes: Indicators pertaining to “launching the gas pipe line and
           related power projects? changed to “preparatory work for contractual
           frameworks? due to change in FGN strategy.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
16.    Direct beneficiaries included the population living in the intervention clusters
and rural communities targeted by the project, 1 as well as 4.4 million electricity

1
 About 25,000 new households were connected and 117,000 consumers and small businesses received
new meters under the NEDP.

                                                                                             4
consumers in Nigeria, including households, businesses/commercial enterprises,
industry, and government.

1.5 Original Components
17.        The project had five components:
      i.   Component 1—Transmission System Development: Comprising rehabilitation
           of dilapidated transmission substations, installation of equipment in existing
           substations, and studies for new 330 kV lines.
    ii.    Component 2—Distribution Efficiency Enhancement: This component
           included investments in distribution line upgrading, distribution transformers,
           meters, technical assistance, and capacity building.
    iii.   Component 3—Access Expansion, Intensification, and Renewables:
           Comprising construction of pilot projects for access expansion and access
           intensification, including development of renewable energy sources. This
           component was cofinanced by GEF. 2
    iv.    Component 4—Technical Assistance to the Project Management Unit:
           Included activities to supervise works financed by the project, the preparation
           of a gas pipeline and gas-to-power project, as well as other technical and
           capacity-building assistance.
     v.    Component 5—Technical Assistance for Reform and Private Participation:
           Included TA for the development of risk-mitigation instruments to facilitate
           privatization, a communications and outreach campaign, and capacity building
           for sector institutions.

1.6 Revised Components
18.        The restructuring modified the components are:
      i.   Component 1—Transmission System Development: This component was
           considerably scaled down following FGN’s decision to include some of the
           activities under NIPP. In addition to a series of investments, the following
           activities were dropped: (a) feasibility and detailed engineering studies for
           extension of transmission system; (b) preparation of bidding documents for
           rehabilitation of the Kainji Hydro Power Station (absorbed under the IDA-
           funded Niger Basin Water Resources Development and Sustainable
           Ecosystems Management Project); and (c) preparation of a transmission
           system development plan for the national grid.
      i.   Component 2—Distribution Efficiency Enhancement: In contrast to component
           1, the scope of component 2 increased due to the scale-up of the Commercial
           Reorientation of the Electricity Sector Toolkit (CREST) Program. A series of
           consultancy studies and advisory services aimed at commercialization and
           privatization of distribution companies (DISCOs) was dropped, however,
           based on FGN’s decision to defer privatization of the DISCOs.




2
 GEF cofinancing amounted to US$1 million and was fully blended into NEDP activities. GEF
outcomes therefore have been incorporated into the overall evaluation of component 3.

                                                                                        5
 ii.    Component 3—Access Expansion, Intensification, and Renewables: No
        changes were made to this component, although the cost increased by US$4
        million due to rebidding and revised cost estimates.
 iii.   Component 4—Technical Assistance to the PMU for Electricity Sector–
        Related Work: No changes were made to this component.
 iv.    Component 5—Policy Reform and Private Participation: Activities and costs
        were reduced by US$1 million, mainly due to shift in FGN strategy.
19.     The comparison of project costs before and after restructuring is in annex 2.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
20.    The first restructuring in 2008 extended the closing date from July 31, 2008, to
June 30, 2010, and changed the name of the implementation agency from NEPA to
PHCN. A level-two restructuring in September 2010 allocated previously unallocated
funds in the amount of US$240,000 to the subcomponent Training, Study Tours, and
Workshops for PHCN.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
21.     The project followed the implementation of TDP, which initiated a dialogue
on power sector reform and changes toward more commercial and private sector
orientation. Lessons from TDP considered during project design included:
   i.   implementing regular customer satisfaction surveys;
  ii.   holding stakeholder communication meetings;
 iii.   playing a catalytic role in adding value to the sector by developing models that
        can be replicated and scaled up; and
 iv.    providing customized capacity-building activities for the implementing
        agencies.
22.     The project’s implementation agencies, the PHCN PMU and the Bureau of
Public Enterprises (BPE), had good track records in project implementation and were
familiar with World Bank procurement processes.
23.     The project was prepared quickly, with the appraisal taking place one month
after the concept note review, due to the urgency of the power sector crisis in Nigeria
and the government’s request for fast processing. TDP financed preparatory studies
and consultancy services to improve NEDP preparation on network system planning,
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA communication systems, and
reactive power compensation. A procurement capacity assessment report, financial
management assessment report, Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF), and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were also prepared for the
project. Fast project preparation shifted procurement to the implementation phase,
causing an initial lag in disbursement. In hindsight, the team’s ability to respond to the
FGN request for fast processing should have been weighed against readiness and
quality at entry.




                                                                                        6
24.     Main shortcomings include:
   i.   An overly ambitious PDO and short implementation period: The project was
        initially designed as a three-year project, which, in hindsight, was unrealistic
        given its scope.
 ii.    Complex design: While the project’s core design was relevant and solid,
        overall design was complicated by the addition of several subcomponents,
        such as rural off-grid electrification, a renewable energy master plan,
        HIV/AIDS information campaign, and TA on gas sector reform.
 iii.    Assessment of risks: Three out of four PDO risks were rated as substantial.
        These risks were: (a) the risk to continued government commitment and
        consensus over the transition strategy and action plan for the establishment of
        the new market structure and privatization; (b) the capacity of newly former
        utilities in terms of financial and human resources to capture the benefits of
        proposed investments; and (c) the lack of institutional coherence and multiple
        mandates.
25.    The risk of limited capacity or interest of state government entities to develop
innovative access expansion projects, especially in off-grid rural areas, was rated as
moderate. It is worth mentioning that the project took a calculated risk in supporting
the ambitious reform program, despite the potential delays in execution.

2.2 Implementation
26.     The project closed on June 30, 2012, with 97.5 percent disbursement of the
credit amount.
Factors that adversely affected implementation
27.    As mentioned previously, implementation of the investment program was
delayed and eventually hampered by the launch of the NIPP and its absorption of
several investments supposed to be covered by NEDP. This US$8 billion program
dwarfed IDA financial contributions to the sector, but also validated NEDP’s role to
leverage best practices and innovations that the government can replicate through
budget-funded programs.
Mid-term review
28.       A mid-term review was conducted in April–May 2008 and covered the
following issues: (i) extension of the closing date by 22 months based on an action
plan prepared by the PMU; (ii) procurement delays addressed at the PMU level; and
(iii) strengthening of the internal audit unit with additional staff.
29.     Although the restructuring proposal had been under discussion with FGN
since 2008, the formal request was received only on December 18, 2009. The delay
in receiving the request was due to internal discussions within FGN on the reform
strategy and time taken for building a consensus on the way forward, particularly in
the context of the development objectives. After the departure of President Yar'Adua
for medical treatment, political processes in Nigeria slowed down, also affecting the
timing and strategy of NEDP restructuring.
30.    Following project restructuring, implementation generally progressed
according to schedule and most activities were completed by project close on June 30,
2012. A few planned activities were not carried out due to minor delays in
procurement and/or implementation, such as the Idi Araba and Kubwa high voltage

                                                                                      7
distribution system (HVDS) clusters, a few transmission upgrades (for instance, the
installation of mobile substations for the Alagbon substation in Lagos), and a few
connections in the Ogun, Enugu, and Cross River State. Implementation of these
activities was transferred to the Nigeria Electricity and Gas Improvement Project
(NEGIP). 3 It was also not possible to conclude the financial and environmental audits
of all PHCN successor companies, as requested by BPE, to facilitate privatization
within the time frame of the project (also transferred to NEGIP).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation, and Utilization
Design
31.      The indicators and targets pertaining to improvements in transmission and
distribution were realistic and appropriate in light of the investments. Indicators were
further refined during project restructuring by specifying that they pertained to project
intervention areas only. An inconsistency over the number of target distribution
clusters during restructuring, along with a broad interpretation of the definition of a
cluster, also led to some confusion over assessing results under project component 2. 4
The indicator on the percentage of cluster-level losses proved to be difficult to
measure, and therefore accurate data are limited. The indicators on the rural
electrification pilots were appropriate, however, there was little information collected
on the degree of state/private and community involvement in these pilots. Indicators
measuring institutional reform were made more specific and less ambitious following
project restructuring. However, a few unspecific indicators remained. For example,
there were no criteria offered to measure the performance of BPE and the PMU, and
there was no clear definition of what should be the expected level of detail for the
renewable energy business model.
Implementation and utilization
32.     M&E data used by the borrower were taken from the following sources: (i)
PHCN for operations, revenue, collapses of the transmission system, and overall
system working data; (ii) PMU database that maintained data on the project
components and the clusters (including the number of transformers and meters
installed); (iii) BPE, which maintained data on TA activities and other government
agencies and DISCOs for specific data. The same data have been used by the ICR
team in assessing NEDP outcomes and were verified in interviews with project staff.
33.    Program engineers at the PMU were regularly collecting data during their
supervision meetings, which was then validated during site visits conducted by the
M&E team at the PMU.




3
    Estimated total amount to be transferred to NEGIP is about US$3.7 million.
4
  In paragraph 17 of the restructuring paper, the number of clusters is proposed to be increased to 9, and
in paragraph 22, the number of new clusters is proposed to increase to 11. The results framework in
annex 1, page 22, states the target as 11. Furthermore, the sites of the additional clusters are not
mentioned in the restructuring paper. As a result of this ambiguity, the PMU has continued
implementing improvements in the distribution network by adding 11 kV feeders at the six original
sites, and deferred the installation of HVDS to NEGIP (see section 3.2 for further details).

                                                                                                        8
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
34.     The PMU’s Environment, Resettlement and Social Unit (ERSU), established
under TDP, was responsible for NEDP’s environmental and social safeguards
compliance. ERSU oversaw the preparation of the ESMF and RPF for the overall
project, as well as audits for the project-funded substation expansions and
improvements, as needed. Over the life of the project, ERSU prepared environmental
and social management plans for the transmission substation rehabilitation and
reinforcement investments and supervised their implementation. In addition, the
Bank’s Health and Safety Guidelines applicable to this project were: Electric Power
Transmission and Distribution, Occupational Health and Safety; and Management and
Monitoring of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). ERSU’s satisfactory performance
has been regularly confirmed by the Bank’s supervision missions.
35.    The one significant safeguard-related issue that arose during project
implementation was a land dispute at the Karu Substation, where a church that had
been constructed on land that the Federal Capital Development Authority (FDCA)
had already allocated to PHCN was demolished by FDCA. The church took legal
action to block the substation construction, but the court denied its request and
authorized construction to proceed. The church’s request for compensation is still
pending in the court. The Bank did not intervene in the dispute, having determined
that the actions taken by PHCN were not inconsistent with the RPF or Bank
Operational Policy 4.12 and that the legal process was functioning effectively to
resolve it.
36.     There was substantial progress in building environmental and social impact
management capacity at the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) during NEDP.
An environment and social unit was established at TCN headquarters, and safeguard
personnel were posted in each of the eight transmission districts. ERSU itself is
remaining a part of the PMU rather than becoming the nucleus of the TCN unit as
planned, because of the large project management workload. All four ERSU members
participated in overseas training during 2009, each in a different African country.
37.     No major fiduciary issues were recorded during the lifetime of the project. On
the procurement side, implementation arrangements and PMU’s capacity were
adequate, partly due to capacity building conducted during implementation of TDP.
During implementation, however, procurement delays materialized mainly due to: (i)
turnover of qualified staff in the PMU and associated time for capacity building in
Bank procurement policies and procedures for replacements; (ii) time required for
restructuring finalization; and (iii) administrative delays related to the opening of
letters of credit. Capacity was built by organizing procurement clinics and training
workshops, and procurement management performance was generally satisfactory for
the duration of the project.
38.     However, a few concerns over the quality of the PMU’s financial management
capacity (such as the Interim Financial Report’s quality and timely submission of
financial management [FM] reports and letters of credit issuance) and internal audit
capacity (the postaudit process in particular) were highlighted. These appear to be
common issues across the board for the PMU, and not only due to its implementation
of NEDP. Strengthening FM capacity should be a focus of future projects
implemented by the PMU.

2.5 Post completion Operation/Next Phase

                                                                                    9
39.     NEDP’s successful development of scalable “islands of excellence,? focusing
on distinct areas of technical and operational challenges in the sector’s reform, has
mainstreamed concepts such as CREST and prepayment metering within budget-
financed and internal revenue–funded programs implemented by FGN. Apart from
already completed programs within NIPP 5 and PHCN applying CREST principles,
the PMU and the World Bank energy team are currently advising NERC and the Bank
of Industry on the ongoing national rollout of prepayment meters to all consumers, 6
funded by increased revenues levied under the new tariff.
40.     Since the relaunch of the reform process in 2010, progress has been
encouraging. Nigeria achieved a record high in August 2012 in terms of available
generation capacity of 4,477 MW and has been able to keep generation levels above
4,000 MW for most of the second half of the year. At the same time, FGN continued
to implement the Roadmap for the Power Sector Reform. It moved forward with
privatizing PHCN’s generation and distribution companies. A request for proposal has
been released for: (i) the sale of up to 70 percent of the shares in each of four gas-
powered GENCOs; (ii) 25-year concessions for two hydropower GENCOs; and (iii)
the sale of at least 51 percent of the shares in 11 DISCOs. The bidding process began
in September 2011, and bids were submitted in July 2012. The bid evaluation process
is ongoing, with the negotiations with selected bidders to begin in January 2013. A
high level power task force led by the President Office continues to monitor the
implementation of the overall reform.
41.     Within this context, successor projects to NEDP, namely the Nigeria
Electricity and Gas Improvement Project (NEGIP), approved in June 2009, and the
Power Sector Guarantees Project (PSGP), currently under preparation are contributing
directly to the pursuit of the power reform agenda. These projects have scaled up
World Bank investment support and dialogue on sector reform to support power
generation, gas sector policies, and regulatory reform. Furthermore, IDA, IFC and
MIGA have prepared a joint business plan to propose a more integrated World Bank
Group response to this critical power reform for the development of Nigeria.
NEGIP
42.      This project’s development objectives are to: (i) improve the availability and
reliability of gas supply to increase power generation in existing public sector power
plants and (ii) improve the power network’s capacity and efficiency to transmit and
distribute quality electricity to the consumers. NEGIP consists of a US$200 million
credit and a US$400 million partial risk guarantee (PRG; US$100 million of IDA
commitment) operation.
43.    The credit component of NEGIP is a continuation and scale-up of NEDP
investments. A restructuring and additional financing for NEGIP was approved on
July 19, 2012, with an additional US$100 million credit (and US$200 million of
additional PRGs) targeting additional resources for TA and transmission investments.




5
 NIPP investments in distribution system rehabilitation, budgeted to approximately US$1 billion, are
using several of the CREST principles including use of smaller transformers.
6
  It has been estimated that over 3 million Nigerian households (or approximately 18 million people)
will have benefited from the new prepayment meters when the program concludes in 2014,
representing a 25-fold scale-up of the NEDP metering program.

                                                                                                 10
PSGP
44.     Building on the ongoing World Bank–IDA support for gas supplies to the
power sector through the use of PRGs, the Nigerian Ministry of Finance (MoF)
requested that the World Bank Group consider an additional support package that
includes the use of IDA (or International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
[IBRD]) PRGs, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) coverage, and
International Finance Corporation (IFC) interventions to support the power sector
reform program. The request focused on a number of independent power plants,
totaling approximately 1,500 MW, being developed by the private sector. In early
2011, MoF presented the World Bank Group with a subsequent request, nominating
an additional 8 independent power plants, 6 PHCN successor generation companies
(GENCOs), and 11 PHCN successor DISCOs for World Bank Group risk mitigation
and credit enhancement support.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
45.     A split evaluation has been carried out to assess project achievements along
each PDO statement before and after restructuring, given the formal nature of the
restructuring. Annex 9 presents the PDO level indicators both at project’s
restructuring and closing. The ratings for relevance, efficiency, and efficacy of the
four PDO statements are summarized in table 1.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
46.     Relevance of objectives before and after restructuring: high. The PDOs were
highly relevant to development in Nigeria. Since the Obasanjo administration, power
sector reform has been a critical objective of successive Nigerian governments due to
its clear links to economic development, competitiveness, and job creation. NEDP
supported government efforts to expand economic opportunities and promote
economic growth by addressing the shortcomings in the power sector with a series of
investments and TA activities, which are still very relevant today, aimed at improving

                                                                                                  11
the quality and supply of electricity services, addressing chronic shortages and
dilapidated transmission and distribution systems, and increasing access.
47.     The project objectives are fully aligned with the "Roadmap to Power Sector
Reform," as presented by President Goodluck Jonathan on August 26, 2010. In fact,
the project, along with TDP and NEGIP, formed a portfolio of projects designed to
promote dialogue on sector reform while investing in power sector improvements.
The roadmap clearly outlines the FGN’s current strategy and actions for
implementing comprehensive power sector reform to expand supply, open the sector
for private investment, and address some the chronic sector issues hampering service
delivery improvement and access expansion. The core reform actions, building on the
EPSR Act, are centered on unbundling the national utility's distribution and
generation assets and their gradual opening to private sector investment and
management.
48.    NEDP is fully aligned with the IDA CPS 2009–13 goal of removing key
roadblocks to rural and urban development.
49.     Relevance of design and implementation before restructuring: modest. The
initial project design was ambitious for the project duration, and fast processing
caused some early implementation delays. When the reform came to a standstill
between 2008 and 2010, the project became less relevant until it was restructured.
50.    Relevance of design and implementation after restructuring: substantial.
During the restructuring, NEDP design and implementation were tailored to the
context and flexibility was built in. Restructuring coincided with the launch of the
reform in 2010, which further increased project relevance. By continuing to focus on
improving transmission and distribution performance, NEDP allowed the Bank to
maintain a credible dialogue that was also cemented in on-the-ground improvements
achieved by the project.
51.     Overall Relevance Rating. Based on the rationale above, project relevance of
objectives, design, and implementation is rated substantial before and after
restructuring.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
52.    Overall, the project was able to achieve its PDOs. Achievement of each of the
four PDO statements is discussed in detail below.
PDO I. Support the government's energy sector reform and key regulations and policy
institutions.
       PDO before restructuring: Support for the government’s energy sector reform
       to facilitate a smooth transition to the new market and institutional structure.
       Achievement of the PDO is rated moderately satisfactory before
       restructuring and satisfactory after restructuring.
53.     The PDO is rated moderately satisfactory measured against the target of a
fully established “new market and institutional structure? by the closing of the
project. In hindsight, it should have been made clearer that the project was necessary,
but not sufficient in itself to sustain and conclude the overall reform process within
the allotted time period.



                                                                                    12
54.    The revised PDO after restructuring recognized the complexity and time
needed for a new market to mature and focused on the actual building blocks of the
reform. Major project achievements include the emergence of new strong institutions:
NEDP supported, through investments and capacity building, the creation of NERC,
the Market Operator, and the Rural Electrification Agency. Although the creation of
the 18 successor companies cannot be credited directly to the project, the project
financed institutional capacity building for their initial operations and provided
substantial TA to the unbundling process.
55.     The project also played a decisive role in the progress of the FGN “Roadmap
for Power Sector Reform? and the establishment of appropriate pricing mechanisms
to ensure the sector's financial viability. NEDP supported NERC in the revision of the
multiyear tariff order (MYTO) to introduce a cost-reflective end-user tariff and 'life-
line' mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable consumers. 7 NERC implemented the
new MYTO tariff starting from June 1, 2012, which provides for a phased increase of
electricity retail tariffs to cost-reflective levels, contemporaneously with a similar
increase in the domestic gas prices. Communication outreach on MYTO, conducted
by NERC and financed by the project, paved the way for a smooth transition to the
higher tariffs. Compared to the public outcry following the removal of fuel subsidies,
the increase in electrical tariff, albeit substantial, was widely accepted as a necessary
step toward an improved power sector.
56.    The project enabled the PMU to evolve into a corporate planning and service
provider for a number of donors as well as internal clients such as NBET and TCN.
Capacity-building programs were carried out to build capacity for the ERSU to
properly address and manage project safeguard issues (section 2.4). Other
communication and support activities included a HIV/AIDS prevention and
awareness campaign conducted for PHCN employees in collaboration with the
National Action Committee on AIDS.
57.     The project supported BPE in carrying out its mandate of privatizing the
power sector utilities. Major milestones achieved by BPE include the completed
bidding process for the privatization of PHCN successor generation and distribution
companies. NEDP financed an international consultant to update the performance
indicators in the management contract and provide advisory services on the
recruitment process for a management contract for TCN. Under this contract, which
came into effect in July 2012, TCN will remain under the government’s ownership
under a 3+2 year management contract with Manitoba Hydro International. The
management contract is designed for improvements in management performance and
transparency of operational and investment requirements and decisions. The project
also supported BPE in its stakeholder consultation meeting in September 2011 with
the PHCN labor union to discuss the implications of privatization.
PDO II. Increase efficiency in the power sector and improve the supply of electricity
and service delivery.
           Achievement of the PDO is rated moderately satisfactory.
58.     The project contributed financed transformers and substations’ upgrades that
led to a significant improvement in grid capacity and efficiency. NEDP financed the
installation of 330/132 kV, 150 megavolt amperes (MVA) transformers and 132/33

    See annex 3 for details on the new MYTO.

                                                                                      13
kV, 60 MVA transformers in priority areas chosen by TCN. A total of 810 MVA were
installed at the selected substations, 30 percent more than the target of 620 MVA at
project closing. To provide an idea of the size of the contribution in terms of
improved efficiency, if converted, 810 MVA are roughly equivalent to a new power
station of about 600 MW of available capacity (assuming a power factor of 75
percent).
59.     NEDP also ensured uninterrupted supply in Victoria Island, Lagos, the
business center of Nigeria, by providing a temporary mobile substation to substitute
for the sinking and heavily dilapidated Alagbon substation, thus allowing the urgent
rehabilitation work to begin as financed under NEGIP. NEDP intervention was timely
to avoid a complete shutdown of the power distribution to the island, with potentially
severe consequences for business activities, the hospitality industry, residents, and
overall economic growth.
60.     Electricity supply improvement was achieved by conversion of the distribution
grid from low voltage long lines to shorter high voltage distribution lines in the cluster
areas. This improved tail end voltage from 180 V to 220 V, lowered outage hours, and
improved the end-user voltage to 33 kV. This had direct positive effects on the living
standards of ordinary citizens because less household equipment was burned out by
voltage fluctuations. Cluster-level losses were also reduced to less than 12 percent in
the Karu, Ogba, Luth, Agege, and Challenge clusters. Furthermore, the introduction
of aerial bundled cables for the low voltage grid and pole-mounted transformers,
along with prepaid meters (PPMs), made electricity theft more difficult. Taking the
Karu cluster as an illustrative example of project impacts in the intervention areas,
table 2 reports the situation before and after NEDP, linking the project interventions
with benefits and impacts for end-users (extract from the borrower report).

                                                                       retailing channels,
                                                                       including online
61.     Lower distribution inefficiencies paired with transmission improvements
helped DISCOs improve revenue management by improving accounts receivables,
replacing the significant commercial losses associated with credit metering and
traditional billing with cash flow positive prepayment systems. According to data
collected by the Karu Business Unit (KBU) in the Abuja DISCO, the energy received
by the DISCO increased about 56 percent between the last two quarters of CY11 and
Q1 CY12 (from an average of 8,296,396 kWh to 12,950,250 kWh per month) due to
the rehabilitation of the Karu Substation. Over the same period, sales of electricity
associated with the PPMs more than doubled (from an average of ₦20,633,409 per
month to an average of ₦41,807,582 per month), with considerable effects on the total
collections for the KBU. It is worth noting that, as of December 2011, the KBU is
consistently raising more revenue from PPM sales than estimated billing (average of
₦41,624,254 per month from sales of PPMs compared to an average of ₦25,731,358
per month from estimated billing).
62.     HVDS and PPMs were installed in six geographical clusters: Agege, Luth, and
Ogba in Lagos, Challenge in Ibadan, and the Abuja suburbs of Karu and Kubwa.
Inconsistency in the number of targeted clusters and their broad definition, however,
limit the ability to assess project achievements based on the number of clusters
completed. 8 During the restructuring, additional funds were allocated to this
component, but the additional clusters were never named. It is therefore unclear
whether new geographical areas were supposed to be included, or, more likely, if the
intention was to increase the number of feeders in the existing set of clusters. If this
was the case, the project supported investments in 24 11kV feeders, as shown in
annex 2.




8
 From page 46 of the NEDP PAD: a cluster could be defined as (i) the network of a distribution
transformer and its downstream infrastructure; (ii) a 11 kV feeder emanating from a 22/11 kV
substation; or (iii) a 33/11 kV substation and the downstream network.

                                                                                               15
63.     Service delivery has improved, which has added credibility to sector reform
and created tangible benefits for households and enterprises. The customer-friendly
interface of the meters has made it easier for customers to read and control the amount
of energy they consume. This, in turn, provided positive consumer benefits in terms of
efficiency and better demand-side management of electricity consumption.
Consumers on PPMs are able to “pay what they consume? instead of relying on
PHCN-estimated billing.
64.     The introduction of PPMs, which are not common in Nigeria, was strongly
welcomed in the target areas. One of the indirect benefits of the project was that it
induced, among customers, demand-side governance and social accountability
behaviors. People today demand better and more transparent service delivery from
Nigerian institutions, particularly PHCN and NERC. Based on experiences from areas
benefitting from the metering program, other PHCN consumers are voicing their
concern on the transparency of estimated billing and requesting more PPMs to be
installed, particularly split meters, which allow consumers to better monitor their
energy consumption.
65.     However, some shortcomings persist: (i) the lack of a plan to address
outstanding customer debt; (ii) despite the DISCO launching an awareness campaign
stating that meter installation is free to consumers, during the ICR field visits there
were reports of customers being asked to pay for PPM installation; and (iii)
purchasing the prepaid electricity codes continues to be a time-consuming process for
customers, who often must queue for several hours. These issues have been discussed
with the concerned entities and remedial actions identified, such as by introducing
third party vendors for electricity credit (with NERC support) to facilitate purchasing
of electricity codes, and promoting transparency through additional communication.
Under current IDA operations, in addition, support will continue to be provided to
DISCOs to improve performance and service delivery. Annex 5 and section 3.6
provide further details on project impacts on consumers, summarizing the findings of
a beneficiary assessment conducted by an independent consultant in the areas around
the Karu cluster in Abuja.
PDO III. Demonstrates models to scale up electricity access.
       Achievement of the PDO is rated moderately satisfactory.
66.     Outcomes under this PDO relate to the provision of grid-based and off-grid
rural electrification models.
67.    Rural grid-based electrification was expanded in the states of Enugu, Ogun,
and the Cross River State. Expansion was achieved through a combination of
extending the grid and reinforcing the existing network with LVDS, HVDS, and
PPMs. NEDP installed a total of 8,100 meters, connecting up 24,600 households in 40
communities. Benefits arising from these activities are equal in nature to those
discussed under PDO II in terms of increased efficiency and improved electricity
supply and service delivery (the scale of the intervention, however, was significantly
smaller).
68.     Electrification was also extended to nine commercial farms in Kaduna State.
These farms were selected in synergy with the Commercial Agriculture Development
Project. To maximize diversification of benefits, farms operating in different market
segments were targeted, particularly poultry, fruit trees, dairy, maize, and fishery. The
project intervention improved the productivity and competitiveness of those farms by

                                                                                      16
providing better and cheaper electricity and by providing considerable savings
compared to diesel generators in use before the project intervention.
69.     Off-grid pilots were conducted in three selected sites of the National Fadama
Development Project, a Bank-supported project to increase the incomes of rural
agricultural areas. The three sites, Ogun, Imo, and Kaduna were selected based on the
commercial performance of the user groups. The projects also installed 45 solar home
systems, 17 solar street lights, including for the community markets, and two solar
water pumps to promote the commercial activities of the user groups.
70.      A different business model was developed for the Mfaminyen Village in the
Cross River State. Mfaminyen is a rural village remotely located 126 km away from
the nearest city, Calabar, reachable only by dirt rural roads, which are often
impassable during the rainy season. Prior to NEDP, the Mfaminyen Village had no
power supply, limited supply of clean water, and the community depended largely on
fuelwood for cooking and kerosene lanterns for lighting. A few inhabitants also
owned small diesel generators. Due to the remote area, however, and the increasing
costs of fuel, operating the generators was very expensive. As part of project
activities, NEDP financed the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels for
electrification and battery charging, a public community space with an information
and communication technology (ICT) business center and television, solar street
lights, and a solar-powered water borehole.
71.     This was a successful pilot that demonstrated that renewable energy was both
feasible and affordable in rural areas. Residents benefited from increased savings (due
to the phase out of generators) and improved clean water and sanitation. Furthermore,
the village has been able to generate revenue from neighboring villages for use of its
battery charging services and water retailing, and is currently marketing itself as eco-
tourism attraction in Nigeria. The project involved a conservation society operating in
the village, the whole community, the Rural Electrification Agency, and state
government very early in the process. Based on the success of the initiative, the state
government committed to replicating the intervention in other villages, maximizing
the leveraging opportunity created under NEDP (an endorsement letter from the state
government is attached in annex 10).
72.    TA was provided for the implementation of a renewable energy master plan,
which is expected to be finalized in December 2012, and will form an input to the
Renewable Energy Act expected in 2013/14.
73.      Despite the success of most of the on-grid projects and the Mfaminyen Village
pilot, the following shortcomings affected the rating of this PDO:
   i.   A microhydro project in Ajassor was considered but abandoned after the state
        government began grid-based electrification and extending the lines to Ajassor
        became the least-cost option.
 ii.    Some of the contracts for the rural electrification in Ogun, Enugu, and Cross
        River State were not concluded in time due to procurement and
        implementation delays.
 iii.   GEF resources available for this component (amounting to a total of US$1
        million) were significantly underutilized, causing a loss of grant resources for
        the project. Only a disappointing 20 percent of the embedded grant funding
        from GEF was utilized for NEDP (about US$200,000).


                                                                                     17
PDO IV. Support gas sector reform to improve gas supply for power generation.
           PDO before restructuring: Support for the government’s gas sector reform to
           develop natural gas resources.
           Achievement of the PDO is rated satisfactory before and after restructuring.
74.    NEDP achieved this PDO by supporting the establishment of the Gas
Aggregator of Nigeria as well as development of the Gas Unit in PHCN. The support
included training, policy dialogue, and short-term TA. In addition, NEDP supported
the development of the strategic aggregation rules for the domestic gas market and the
preparatory work on the risk mitigation aspects, leading to the development of
NEGIP.
75.    The FGN’s Gas Master Plan, launched in 2009 with the support of NEGIP and
NEDP, has marked a major shift in the government’s attention to this key driver of
economic growth and has gained broad-based support from the upstream oil and gas
industry including both by private gas producers as well as government-owned oil and
gas companies under NNPC. Master plan implementation has already achieved a
number of significant milestones toward establishing a balanced domestic gas market
that would provide the right pricing signals and incentives to increase gas production
and processing for domestic consumption. These milestones include:
      i.   executing the first commercial Gas Supply and Aggregation Agreements
           (GSAA) with the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and
           Chevron Nigeria Limited Joint Ventures (CNL JVs), backed by NEGIP
           PRGs—the joint ventures represent approximately 70 percent of domestic gas
           capacity9;
    ii.    implementing the revised transitional commodity pricing structure, with an
           initial increase from US$0.1/mmbtu to US$1.0/mmbtu (implemented in Q4
           2010), to reach near export parity by 2013 with a target price of
           US$2.0/mmbtu;
    iii.   establishing the Gas Aggregation Company Nigeria Limited (GACN) in
           January 2010 to facilitate access and firm gas allocation from domestic gas
           suppliers to existing power plants and prospective power sector investors (and
           other gas-based industries); and
    iv.    developing a robust contractual framework for gas supply, including a
           bankable model GSAA and gas transport agreements, and a gas transmission
           network code to facilitate subsequent gas sales in the sector.
76.    The reform actions are starting to yield results in terms of increased domestic
gas availability. In 2008, only about 300 mmscfd of gas was available for domestic


9
 In August 2012, SPDC informed the World Bank that the gas assets in the Western axis supplying the
EGBIN Power plant had been sold and thus SPDC would no longer require a PRG for the gas supply to
EGBIN GENCO. The asset sale has led to the otherwise finalized SPDC PRG transaction being put on
hold while an alternative SPDC gas supply to a government owned power plant in the eastern axis is
being developed.

                                                                                                18
consumption against a demand of 600 mmscfd. Severe gas supply constraints have
been relieved over the last 18 months with available supplies increasing to 1,000
mmscfd by Q4 2011. Part of the success can be traced to the implementation of the
FGN Gas Master Plan. The positive trend is expected to continue as the FGN pursues
the 12 month Gas-to-Power Emergency Development Plan, which aims to double the
amount of gas available to the power sector to fuel the new power plants being
commissioned under NIPP.
77.      Overall Efficacy Rating. Based on the assessment above and the sub-ratings as
summarized in Table 1, the achievement of Project Development Objectives
(efficacy) has been rated moderately satisfactory before and after restructuring. A
different weight has been attributed for each PDO statement. In particular, given the
project relevance to the reform process, the overall outcome ratings have been guided
by project achievements with respect to this key PDO. The other PDOs were given
less weight because: (i) investments underpinning PDO 2 were designed to be
supporting the reform efforts under PDO 1; (ii) the rural and renewable electrification
activities underpinning PDO 3 were confined to piloting of concepts, and thus were
limited in scope, even in the original design of the project; and (iii) the activities in
the gas sector underpinning PDO 4 were mainly aimed at providing TA and limited in
scope

3.3Efficiency
Project efficiency is rated substantial.
78.     Methodology. As part of the ICR process, an economic and financial re-
evaluation of the Project was carried out. This re-evaluation took into account
changes in assumptions for some parameters, namely: (i) actual project costs; (ii)
revision of the project implementation schedule; (iii) lower volume of incremental
energy generated and therefore delivered to the transmission and distribution system;
and (iv) the new MYTO introduced in June 2012.
79.     A new economic and financial model has been developed, due to the
unavailability of the one used during original appraisal and restructuring. To ensure
consistency of results, the new model was designed and tested based on the details
available in the PAD. Results of the tests confirmed the values found in the PAD and
restructuring paper (see Table below). At restructuring, the new model appears to be
more conservative in terms of values, but confirms the trend of improved Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and the Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR).
80.     Project Costs and Benefits. Actual project costs and yearly disbursement
figures were used for the re-evaluation. In line with the original analysis, the Project
investments yielded five distinct benefits: (i) reduction of losses (technical and non-
technical); (ii)improved power quality and supply reliability; (iii) avoided captive
generation; (iv) improved revenues; and (v) enhanced customer satisfaction.
81.     Results. The table below provides a summary of the result of the economic and
financial re-evaluation and comparison with the original PAD and restructuring paper
(considering both the original and new models).




                                                                                      19

82.    It appears clear that the economic and financial feasibility of investments
remains in the same range of the estimation at the time of appraisal and restructuring.
The EIRR and the FIRR remain strong, reflecting the economic and financial benefits
arising from the project. The lower load growth and the delays in project
implementation had only limited impacts on the EIRR and FIRR.
83.     Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was carried out, assuming the load
increase forecasted during original appraisal and restructuring (4 percent). In this
case, the EIRR and FIRR for the project are equal to 50.76 percent and 28 percent
respectively, representing higher rate of returns compared with the original project
and confirming even more the robustness of the project efficiency.
84.      A separate analysis was also carried out for the rural and renewable
electrification component, not included in the economic and financial analysis of the
original project and restructuring. EIRR and FIRR for this component are 37.8 percent
and 22.3 percent, conforming also in this case the economic and financial viability of
the project.
85.    Considerable nonquantifiable benefits also materialized from the project, such
as overall improvements in beneficiaries’ life standards, as outlined in the beneficiary
assessment, as well as reduced time spent on water and firewood collection and better
health and safety conditions caused by the phasing out of fuel-based electricity
generation (both in terms of reducing emissions and decreasing the risks of accidents
caused by kerosene and candles). Further details on the economic reevaluation are
presented in annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
86.     The overall project outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. This rating
combines the assessment of project relevance (section 3.1), efficacy (section 3.2) and
efficiency (section 3.3), and takes into account the World Bank Operations Policy and
Country Services guidelines on rating formally restructured projects. 10.



10
  For projects with formally revised objectives, project outcomes are assessed against both the original
and revised project objectives. The separate outcome ratings were weighed in proportion to the share of
actual credit disbursement in the periods before and after restructuring. In the case of NEDP,
disbursement prior to restructuring amounted to 70 percent of the credit.

                                                                                                    20
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development
87.     NEDP contributed directly to broad social development by providing
communities in cluster areas with improved access to power, connecting the rural
poor to the grid, and promoting community involvement in the rural electrification
pilots. NEDP’s poverty impact component was met by installation of PPMs, which
allowed customers to control their energy spending, while shorter outage hours
reduced spending on generators. The MYTO also safeguarded a life-line tariff that
protects poor consumers from power price increases.
88.    Annex 5 describes some observed benefits in the Karu distribution cluster in
Abuja. These include reduced pollution due to the replacement of diesel generators,
increased productivity and income for small and medium enterprises, increased
consumer awareness on energy management and savings, and reduced electricity theft
and meter tampering.
Institutional change/strengthening
89.    Institutional strengthening was at the heart of the project design and
implementation. Intensive dialogue and consultations with stakeholders and support
for policy reforms, especially post-2010, contributed significantly to institutional
changes in the power sector.
Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive or negative)
90.     There were no other unintended outcomes and impacts observed under this
project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Assessment
91.     A qualitative beneficiary assessment was conducted upon completion of
NEDP to measure the socioeconomic results of the transmission and distribution
improvement components as perceived by the residents of some of the intervention
areas. The Karu cluster was selected on the basis of its perceived success as a
complete rehabilitation and CREST roll-out scheme and was compared to a
nonintervention area, Zuba. Results from two other full intervention areas (those that
received pole-mounted transformers and PPMs), Mararaba and Nyana, were also
captured and compared to partial intervention areas (received either pole-mounted
transformers or PPMs).
92.        The survey’s main findings are 11:
      i.   Overall: Most of the people interviewed in Karu agreed that the project
           brought significant benefits in terms of better electricity availability, services,
           and quality. In full intervention areas, the majority of respondents now have
           between 10 to 24 hours of power per day, every day of the week, with most
           reporting more than 18 hours.
     ii.   Residential customers: In Karu and Nyanya, residential customers reported as
           much as a 60 to 90 percent reduction in generator fuel expenditure, with the


11
     Further details on the methodology, results, and case studies are reported in annex 5.

                                                                                              21
        sharpest reductions cited in Karu. Respondents also provided several
        anecdotes illustrating improvements in the quality of their personal and family
        lives due to the improvement of electricity services.
 iii.   Small and medium enterprises: Among small and medium enterprises, savings
        on generator fuel have been used to expand operating capital or otherwise
        increase disposable income. Some businesses pass on the savings to their
        customers, as in the case of print shops that have reduced the unit cost of
        printing and photocopying by as much as 50 percent when power is available.
 iv.    Social service providers: The impact of improved power supply on the ability
        of social service organizations to meet their objectives is significant. Many
        health centers are able to store vaccines for longer and generally dispense their
        services more efficiently. In schools, teaching and learning processes have
        been enhanced, especially on computer-based modules. By contrast, those
        schools that have been unaffected by the improvements still find it difficult to
        deliver even the most basic practical courses in science and technology.
  v.    More attention to energy efficiency and better demand-side management:
        Billing is now widely perceived to be more transparent and commensurate to
        usage.
93.     Despite the positive impacts mentioned above, a series of shortcomings were
reported during the survey. Some examples include: (i) although meters were installed
free of charge, people reported that they were told to pay for “wiring and connection?
rather than for the meters; (ii) long queues to top-up meters; and (iii) mixed results in
partial intervention areas. These issues were discussed with the PMU and other
stakeholders to identify remedial actions, such as intensification of the public
awareness campaign to inform the public about the installation of meters free of
charge, increasing the number of third party vendors for electricity credits, and the
replication of NEDP activities to continue CREST-like investments in other clusters.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
94.    The rating of risk to development outcome is assessed as significant. The
borrower is committed to ensure that the investments carried out under NEDP are not
only sustained over time, but also scaled up to improve the performance of the
Nigerian power sector. There is, however, a series of risks affecting the sustainability
of development outcome, which are outlined in this section.
95.      Sector reform. Commitment to the presidential power sector reform roadmap
remains well entrenched at all levels of government. However, vested interests are
still active and may lead to some loss of momentum in the implementation of the
reforms (in addition to the recent departure of the Minister of Energy and the director
of BPE). For the PHCN privatization process itself, the relatively stringent
application of due process, including the voluntary disclosure of conflict of interest by
the Minister, lends some credibility to the vetting process by BPE and National
Council on Privatization and will hopefully set precedence for other members of
government with similar interests. If the minister’s conflict of interest issues had not
been disclosed during this early stage, it would have risked discrediting the evaluation
process with the possibility of derailing the entire process later, after contracts had
been awarded. Given the wide scope and complex context of the reform process,
future setbacks are still to be expected. Continuous engagement with government


                                                                                      22
stakeholders, also as part of the PSGP project preparation, will be needed to keep
supporting reform momentum.
96.      Rural and renewables electrification. Stakeholders and local governments
provided strong positive feedback and commitment to long-term sustainability on
NEDP rural and renewable activities. Strong community ownership of project
activities provides reassurances regarding proper maintenance and operation of
project assets. The FGN, however, needs to remain involved in and fund rural and
renewable electrification schemes. One of the positive outcomes of power sector
reforms was the establishment of a Rural Electrification Agency and the associated
Rural Electrification Fund, which are imperative and important for developing
countries like Nigeria with a large rural and poor population. To be able to meet this
important mandate, the Rural Electrification Agency needs substantial financial and
technical support paired with a comprehensive capacity-building plan. There is also
the need to introduce provisions, currently lacking in government privatization plans,
delineating targets for rural and renewable energy, or incentives to serve either of
these areas. Once targets or models are established, the government needs to take
actions to ensure their implementation, effectiveness, and efficacy. This requires
strong commitment from all levels within government, significant resource
mobilization in support of rural electrification, and an increased use of renewable
resources in Nigeria to ensure sustainability and long-term success.
97.      Investments. Design and implementation of all investments under NEDP were
carried out in close partnership with the government agencies responsible for the
sector. Those institutions have strongly committed to maintaining and operating
project assets to guarantee continuous delivery of benefits to consumers. However,
availability of O&M funds remains a concern. On the transmission side, the
management contractor for TCN provides reassurances on its commitment to proper
and well-funded O&M for project assets. There has been pressure, however, to cancel
the contract due to lack of clarity over the responsibility to sign the contract between
BPE and the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP). BPP requested the President
Office to cancel the management contract, claiming that the procurement and signing
of the contract was in BPP’s institutional mandate and not BPE. As of today,
however, the President did not accept BPP’s argument and the management contract
is still valid. This contract is a pillar in the reform process. Its cancellation would not
only slow down the much needed performance enhancement of TCN, but also give a
strong negative signal to the market as the FGN is embarking on a series of IPPs and
privatization of GENCOs and DISCOs. On the distribution side, some of NEDP
investments have already been included in the assets evaluation of DISCOs to be
privatized, and the private owner will ensure proper O&M. For the DISCOs that will
remain in public hands, there is a risk of unfunded O&M and sufficient steps may not
be taken to improve the performance of those DISCOs.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry
98.     The Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry was rated moderately
satisfactory. The project’s fast-track preparation was in direct response to the
government’s request for a flagship operation to support the implementation of the

                                                                                        23
recently passed Energy Sector Reform Act. The team was able to respond to the
request in record time, building on the implementation arrangements already
established under TDP. A series of preparatory studies and consultancy services were
carried out to ensure proper preparation of project investments and identification of
TA activities. However, rapid project preparation left little time to prepare the
necessary procurement documentation to allow rapid launch of the investment
program, and while the risks to project activities were properly identified, the initial
three-year time frame required for project implementation was underestimated.
Quality of supervision
99.     The overall rating for quality of supervision was satisfactory. Positive aspects
of supervision included a strong focus on policy dialogue on long-term development
goals and technology solutions, supervision, and implementation support to drive
accelerated performance after initial slow disbursement. The dialogue included
detailed discussions and advice to government and utilities on energy reform, cost-
reflective tariffs, privatization and other policy issues, close involvement in portfolio
reviews, and site visits. Because of the presence of Bank specialists in the areas of
procurement, financial management and safeguards, fiduciary issues were monitored
continuously and they were able to quickly react and identify mitigating measures for
fiduciary issues that emerged during the project.
100. The deep level of dialogue and strong sector relationships built over
successive projects allowed the Bank to be proactive and quickly adapt to emerging
issues, as reflected by the restructuring of the project in 2010. Despite the lack of
proactivity in the government strategy, the Bank remained strongly engaged in the
sector and was able to quickly process the restructuring after the government’s formal
request. The Bank team also provided continuity, with two task team leaders for the
project during project preparation and implementation. Since July 2010, the project
has been supervised by a task team leader based in Abuja, which means daily client
contact. To increase stakeholders’ participation and highlight the project benefits, the
World Bank’s implementation support also focused on community outreach and
communication, in particular during the launch of the PPM campaign. The flexibility
built into the restructuring allowed the project to achieve its development objectives
despite the shift in government strategy in 2010.
Justification of rating for overall Bank performance
101. Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. This rating is a combination of
strong Bank performance during supervision and the moderately satisfactory rating
for quality at entry. The rating takes into account that there were compelling reasons
for expediting Board approval, and that the Bank team did proactively monitor
changing circumstances and restructured the project to address those circumstances
and flexibly supported a homegrown reform process while providing intensive hands-
on implementation.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Government performance
102. Government performance is rated satisfactory. The government was very
active during project preparation. Despite some initial delays in the ratification
process for the credit, it demonstrated strong ownership and commitment to achieve
development objectives. After 2008, due to the shift in FGN’s priority, the reform

                                                                                      24
momentum, which delivered important results such as the unbundling of PHCN and
the creation of new institutions in the sector and supported the results and investments
under NEDP, came to a halt. In 2010, however, with the relaunch of the Roadmap for
the Power Sector Reform, a clear strategy was put in place and the government
steered the sector in the right direction again. Multiple changes in government
strategy and periodical lack of ownership caused delays in project implementation and
project restructuring, but they are not deemed significant enough to reduce the
performance rating.
Implementing agency(ies) performance
103. The performance of the implementing agency (PMU) is rated as satisfactory.
PHCN-PMU was effective in implementing the project and monitoring the progress
of various components. The PHCN-PMU helped achieve project objectives through
extensive collaboration with the BPE and NERC. The success of the PMU in project
implementation has caused it to be given the responsibility to implement additional
projects such as NEGIP. In terms of fiduciary capacity, shortcomings were noted in
the PMU’s FM aspects of project implementation (although they have been addressed
during project implementation with the support of the Bank’s fiduciary specialists).
Justification of rating for overall borrower performance
104. On balance, borrower performance is rated satisfactory. This rating takes into
account that the minor shortcomings in FGN performance did not affect the
borrower’s overall commitment to the project and the satisfactory performance of the
implementing agency, which continued to implement the project even when reform
momentum slowed.

6. Lessons Learned
105. The project offers several strategic and operational lessons for the design of
future power sector projects.
106. Leverage IDA financing, creating scalable islands of excellence. NEDP’s
investment program demonstrates best practice on how limited IDA financing can
drive change through a combination of investment to create visible results on the
ground and using TA to improve the effectiveness of larger government-funded
programs. The CREST approach did not only provide investment capital to replace
dilapidated infrastructure, but provided tangible examples of the solutions available to
the utilities in addressing core operational and technical challenges. Full-scale
implementation of these technical and commercial innovations, customized to the
Nigerian context, have been critical in convincing an often conservative cadre of
engineering and utility experts of the feasibility and direct benefits that can be
realized by addressing entrenched technical, commercial, and social challenges
affecting the performance of urban power distribution.
107. Because the privatization program is expected to trigger dramatically
increased investments in distribution infrastructure, new operators will look for
solutions to the same challenges addressed under NEDP. It is therefore likely that the
examples provided by the project will continue to influence the distribution utility
turnaround efforts for years to come. Some of these best practices that could be
widely replicated in other operations include:
  i.   Cluster approach: NEDP has actively targeted selected geographical areas,
       addressing the full electricity distribution value chain, from upstream
                                                                                     25
           transmission-distribution delivery capacity to downstream service provision
           and commercial interfaces. The HVDS cluster approach has, through this
           comprehensive approach, achieved not only technical performance, but also
           clear and measurable commercial impact.
     ii.   Customized specifications (transformers and PPMs): The technical design of
           distribution investments aimed at addressing long outage times and frequent
           overloading of transformers (often leading to complete destruction of the
           equipment) by the introduction of “self-protected? transformers, better suited
           to Nigerian operational and maintenance specificities than the off-the-shelf
           transformers.
 iii.      PPM split design: The introduction of split-type PPMs, with the metering
           function located on the pole outside the customer premises and only the
           recharge interface inside the customer premises, has reduced the ability to
           defraud and tamper with the metering function and makes it easier for the
           utility to maintain and verify the meters (because access to customer premises
           is no longer necessary).
 iv.       Stakeholder engagement: Involving communities and village governance
           structure and other NGOs/agencies working in the area facilitated project
           implementation, in addition to assuring sustainability over time. Involving
           local community not only helped in creating local ownership, but also
           transferred capacity and knowledge. The project’s cluster approach built a
           strong bond with the host communities and beneficiaries because the project
           was seen as providing complete solutions and lasting results rather than
           piecemeal investments where real improvements are held back by remaining
           deficiencies. 12
     v.    Project readiness for implementation during preparation: When designing projects,
           emphasis should first be placed on having adequate procurement and accounting
           capacity in place rather than project effectiveness. Procurement staff should be
           identified early and given adequate training. The team should ensure that adequate
           procurement capacity and draft documents (bidding document, requests for
           proposals, terms of reference, and so forth) are also put in place before
           effectiveness.
 vi.       Flexibility in project design: Reform processes of the magnitude envisaged in Nigeria
           take time to mature, and are often subject to unforeseen changes in policy and/or
           implementation timeline. Increased flexibility in project design and adapted PDOs
           might have allowed the project to avoid the restructuring process.
vii.       Use Bank projects to pilot innovative approaches for service delivery and access: The
           project demonstrated that it is possible to implement models for alternative
           renewables and rural off-grid solar PV that can be replicated in other projects and
           regionwide. The projects in Mfaminyen Village and Kaduna’s commercial farms
           have been completed successfully and are functioning well.
viii.      Strong sector institutions are important to reform sustainability: As the sector
           reforms mature, and privatization and competition increase, FGN’s emphasis
           will shift from financing and building infrastructure to building institutions


12
   This is also evident from the beneficiary assessment, where areas only receiving metering
investments were much less satisfied, because the overall supply improvements had not been realized
due to remaining grid constraints.

                                                                                                26
      and capacity for policy formulation, regulation, and electricity market
      operations. NEDP’s early support to the development of these institutional
      pillars of the new sectoral landscape allowed these institutions to play a crucial
      role as co-anchors of the day-to-day actions needed to move the reform
      forward and broaden the public and business appeal through outreach and
      consultation programs. It is difficult to see how the tariff reform implemented
      on June 1, 2012, could have been developed without the emergence of a strong
      regulator able to reconcile the needs of the investment community, consumer
      interests, and policy objectives into a coherent tariff model and regulatory
      order. FGN needs to continue the dedicated and targeted efforts to strengthen
      and improve the governance of NERC, Bulk Trader and TCN, as well as other
      key institutions in the sector, to ensure that the gains already achieved are not
      lost in future changes in administration.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The economic analysis of the project prepared during the processing of NEDP and
reviewed during the restructuring in 2010, concluded that the Economic Internal Rate
of Return (EIRR) of the Project was 47.01 percent and its Financial Internal Rate of
Return (FIRR) was 19.07 percent (from respectively 43.2 percent and 16.6 percent in
the original PAD).
Methodology. As part of the ICR process, an economic and financial re-evaluation of
the Project was carried out. This re-evaluation took into account changes in
assumptions for some parameters, namely: (i) actual project costs; (ii) revision of the
project implementation schedule; (iii) lower volume of incremental energy generated
and therefore delivered to the transmission and distribution system; and (iv) the new
MYTO introduced in June 2012.
The key assumptions 13 used in the calculation of the Economic and Financial Internal
Rates of Return in the original PAD for the transmission & distribution components
were:
                           Assumption                                    Value

     Load Factor                                                         0.806
     Load Growth                                                           4%

     Power Factor                                                         0.85

     Technical Losses                                                     20%
For this analysis, the same assumptions were considered, except for (i) the load
growth; and (ii) tariff. The load growth was considered 0 percent since no significant
increase over the long term was observed in the energy generated in the Nigerian grid.
As consequence, all incremental sales were revised downwards due to the constraint
in available generation. As for the tariff value, the analysis took into account the latest
increase in MYTO tariff introduced in June 2012, strongly supported by the project.
Details on the new MYTO are provided in the Box below.
Box A3.1 Revision of the Nigeria MYTO (2)

NERC was established pursuant to the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (Act) of 2005. Section 76(2)
of the Act requires NERC to adopt electricity tariffs that:

(i) allow full recovery of efficient operating costs, including a reasonable rate of return,
(ii) give incentives to sustain improvement in efficiency and quality,



13
  The extra energy made available by the investment is estimated at about 15% of total energy injected
(non-incremental sales figure in the matrix) resulting from fewer breakdowns subsequent to
replacement of life-expired transformers with new transformers (source: PHCN’s actual figures of
breakdowns but assuming a conservative figure).

                                                                                                   32
(iii) send appropriate signals to customers to encourage increased efficiency in system use, and
(iv) phase out or reduce cross-subsidies.

In discharging this obligation, NERC adopted an incentive-based, two-part tariff methodology in the
first MYTO in 2008, which was originally pioneered by the United Kingdom in 1980s/1990s and
widely adopted in many countries since. The MYTO’s assumptions are subject to a minor annual
review to reflect changes in inflation rate, gas prices and foreign exchange assumptions, and a major
review of all the assumptions every five years to keep the tariff in line with current circumstances.
While minor revisions have been implemented annually by NERC since 2008, it accelerated the major
review due in 2013 upon request from DISCOs to reflect major changes in the companies’ operating
environments and the anticipated reform process outlined in FGN’s roadmap, which was released in
August 2010.

The roadmap estimates the long-term, cost-reflective end-user tariffs to be close to ₦22 per kWh
(US$0.14/kWh), more than double the previous average retail tariff of ₦10 per kWh (US$0.6/kWh).
Because FGN recognized that these reforms were a high priority, NERC implemented the new MYTO
tariff starting from June 1, 2012, which allows a phased increase of electricity retail tariffs to cost-
reflective levels, contemporaneously with a similar increase in the domestic gas prices.

The tariff structure includes specific tariff classes for residential, commercial, industrial, and
special/street lighting consumer groups. NERC intends to maintain an R1 residential tariff class with
life-line social safety net features, including no fixed charge and a low energy charge of approximately
₦4/kWh (approximately US$0.025/kWh), making this one of the lowest tariffs charged in the region.
The funding of the R1 tariff class will be levied through cross-subsidies from the other tariff classes
and therefore will have to be well targeted and defined to include only the most vulnerable and poorest
consumers. The other tariff classes will see marked increases ranging from 20–50 percent over 2012
with the main residential class R2 (as well as the lowest commercial and industrial tariff groups)
expected to benefit from transitional subsidies allocated to reduce the incremental increase in fixed
charges over two years.

A new economic and financial model has been developed, due to the unavailability of
the one used during original appraisal and restructuring. To ensure consistency of
results, the new model was designed and tested based on the details available in the
PAD. Results of the tests confirmed the values found in the PAD and restructuring
paper (see Table below). At restructuring, the new model appears to be more
conservative in terms of values, but confirms the trend of improved Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and the Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR).
Project Costs and Benefits. Actual project costs and yearly disbursement figures were
used for the re-evaluation. In line with the original analysis, the Project investments
yielded five distinct benefits: (i) reduction of losses (technical and non-technical);
(ii)improved power quality and supply reliability; (iii) avoided captive generation; (iv)
improved revenues; and (v) enhanced customer satisfaction.
Results. The table below provides a summary of the result of the economic and
financial re-evaluation and comparison with the original PAD and restructuring paper
(considering both the original and new models).

It appears clear that the economic and financial feasibility of investments remains in
the same range of the estimation at the time of appraisal and restructuring. The EIRR
and the FIRR remain strong, reflecting the economic and financial benefits arising
from the project. The lower load growth and the delays in project implementation had
only limited impacts on the EIRR and FIRR.
Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was carried out, assuming the load increase
forecasted during original appraisal and restructuring (4 percent). In this case, the
EIRR and FIRR for the project are equal to 50.76 percent and 28 percent respectively,
representing higher rate of returns compared with the original project and confirming
even more the robustness of the project efficiency.
A separate analysis was also carried out for the rural and renewable electrification
component, not included in the economic and financial analysis of the original project
and restructuring. EIRR and FIRR for this component are 37.8 percent and 22.3
percent, conforming also in this case the economic and financial viability of the
project.
Considerable nonquantifiable benefits also materialized from the project, such as
overall improvements in the life standards of the beneficiaries, as highlighted in the
beneficiary assessment, as well as reduced time spent on water and firewood
collection and better health and safety conditions caused by the phasing out of fuel-
based electricity generation (both in terms of reducing emissions and decreasing the
risks of accidents caused by kerosene and candles).

A beneficiary assessment was conducted after NEDP was completed to measure the
socioeconomic results of the transmission and distribution improvement components
as perceived by the residents of some of the intervention clusters. The Karu cluster
was selected on the basis of its perceived success as a CREST electricity
rehabilitation scheme, and was compared with a nonintervention area, Zuba. Results
from two other full intervention areas (those that received pole-mounted transformers
and PPMs), Mararaba and Nyana, were also captured and compared with partial
intervention areas (received either pole-mounted transformers or PPMs).
The main tool used in the assessment were semistructured interviews, conducted with
three respondent categories: category A consisted of residential customers (making a
distinction between residents living in single rooms, flats or those in detached
housing); category B consisted of owners or employees of small and medium
enterprises; and category C consisted of personnel in social service institutions such
as schools, health centers, and places of worship.

a. Mararaba is listed separately because it is both a full and a partial intervention area.

The survey’s main findings are:
     •    Prior to the project: Rationing of power was a common trend in all areas, with
          most neighborhoods having power for three or four days in the week and
          having no power at all the rest of the time, leading to the coinage of the terms
          “on? and “off? days. In the partial and nonintervention areas especially, off
          days could last from a few weeks to a few months. The distribution of on and
          off days was generally perceived by customers to be subject to the whims of
          PHCN staff. Low or inconsistent voltage output was another problem that
          seemed endemic to all areas.

     •    Impact on power supply: In full intervention areas, the majority of respondents
          now have between 10 to 24 hours of power a day, every day of the week, with


                                                                                                         37
    most reporting more than 18 hours. Episodes of power outage have become
    very brief, sometimes lasting only a few minutes.

•   Comparison of full intervention, partial intervention, and nonintervention
    areas: While customers in full intervention areas are reporting 18 hours of
    power a day, those in partial intervention areas still rely on private or
    community transformers. The assessment revealed that customers who only
    received PPMs had expected their power situation to improve drastically,
    despite still being connected to faulty transformers. Even in full intervention
    areas, many respondents attributed improved power to the advent of PPMs,
    perhaps because this is the aspect of the project that is closest to them. Some
    expectations management is required here. Customers in nonintervention areas
    are still facing acute power shortages, and for many residents of Zuba, a
    generator is considered a luxury good, and so they are simply making do
    without power with resultant reductions in productivity and income.

•   Socioeconomic benefits to residents: In Karu and Nyanya, residential
    customers cited several anecdotes illustrating improvements in the quality of
    their personal and family lives. Women in particular appreciate the ability to
    shop in large quantities and store perishable food items in their refrigerators
    and freezers. Parents are pleased that their children have more outlets for
    education and entertainment and can sleep better at night with the aid of fans
    and air conditioning units. Other simple comforts cited were a reduction in
    noise pollution as a result of a general decline in the use of generators and the
    ability to get a cold drink from the fridge when it is desired.

•   Fuel expenditure reductions: Residential customers reported as much as a 60–
    90 percent reduction in generator fuel expenditure, with the sharpest
    reductions cited in Karu.

•   Benefits to small and medium enterprises: Among business customers, savings
    on generator fuel have been used to expand operating capital or otherwise
    increase disposable income. Some businesses pass on the savings to their
    customers, as in the case of print shops that have reduced the unit cost of
    printing and photocopying by as much as 50 percent when power is available.
    Box A5.1 illustrates the benefits of the project for a photography studio in
    Karu.

    Box A5.1 Impact on a Photography Studio in Karu

    In Karu market, business has never been better for Simon, who now has near-constant power
    supply to operate his flash, lights, and computers—the major pieces of equipment in his
    photography studio. Though Simon finds it more expensive to run his new PPM, he has
    factored the expense into his operating costs and concluded that it is much better than, even
    incomparable to, the options he had prior to the intervention. His cost-benefit analysis
    suggests that the current PPM system works well for businesses like his that are power
    intensive, because they formerly had to run on generators most of the time.

    With the recent tariff increase, Simon now spends about ₦4,000 every month on electricity. In
    the past, Simon asserted, a 25 liter jerry can of petrol would last for between five and seven
    days. This translated into a monthly petrol expenditure of between ₦12,000 and ₦18,000, in
    addition to the ₦600 he paid to PHCN for the unreliable electricity supply. The situation now


                                                                                               38
    is vastly different: at the time of the interview, the 20 liter jerry can of petrol he had been
    using for a month had not yet been exhausted because he had only needed to use the generator
    three times so far. The generator is now essentially a standby source of power for the few
    times that grid supply is interrupted.

•   Benefits to social service providers: The impact of improved power supply on
    the ability of social service organizations to meet their objectives is
    significant. Many health centers are able to store vaccines for longer and
    generally dispense their services more efficiently. In schools, teaching and
    learning processes have been enhanced, especially on computer-based
    modules. By contrast, those schools that have been unaffected by the
    improvements still find it difficult to deliver even the most basic practical
    courses in science and technology. In one place of worship, there is increased
    attendance at evening services because worshippers are sure that they will be
    able to find their way home afterward by the light reflected from buildings
    along the path. Boxes A5.2 and A5.3 provide two examples from an
    orphanage and a health center in Karu.

    Box A5.2 Impact on an Orphanage in Karu

    The staff at Future Leaders Orphanage in Karu cares for 57 orphans ranging from babies to
    children in their early teens. Of the many end uses of power in the “home,? as it is referred to
    by staff, health care delivery and food preservation are among the most important. The home
    operates a small clinic for the children that is also open to the public at no cost. Prior to
    intervention, power supply in the home was episodic and voltage output was often low. The
    alternative source of power was a diesel generator that was needed most of the time, but was
    only switched on between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. every night to minimize fuel expenditure.

    Beginning in January 2011, however, the power situation in the home changed dramatically.
    Residents are now assured of daily power supply, “from morning to evening,? perhaps with a
    few interruptions in between. The potential for energy use in the home is only now beginning
    to be realized: a lot of appliances like televisions and fans are now kept on constantly; ironing
    can be done at more convenient times during the day, instead of waiting for the former 4-hour
    window of power availability in the evenings. The greatest positive impact has been felt in the
    kitchen, where the refrigerator and freezer now work at almost full capacity.


    Table A5.3 Impact on a Health Center in Karu

    All Saints Clinic, a faith-based health center in Karu, suffered severe power shortages; power
    only came on “sometimes,? and when it did, it was “with very low voltage output.? Sam, the
    clinic administrator, had to ensure that there were always enough diesel for the generator that
    was needed for running laboratory tests and for lighting at night. In addition, the clinic paid
    “outrageous? monthly bills to PHCN.

    The power situation improved dramatically after 2012, when a pole-mounted transformer was
    installed in the area. Power supply is now “far much better than ever? and goes uninterrupted
    for days. The clinic still uses its diesel generator when the power goes out, but that is a rarer
    occasion now. Nowadays Sam often forgets to check diesel availability. Laboratory staff can
    run their equipment without fear of constant interruption, patients no longer have to wait in
    pain while staff runs around trying to buy diesel for the generator, the grounds are well lit at
    night and patients can sleep well at night—all at significantly reduced cost to the clinic.




                                                                                                  39
   •   Impact of PPMs: Prior to project implementation, the majority of customers in
       full, partial and no intervention areas either had analog meters or none at all,
       the latter group being directly connected to neighborhood transformers.
       Customers with NEDP-supported PPMs report that they appreciate the degree
       of freedom and control that the pay-as-you-go system gives them over their
       energy consumption and expenditure. A customer can now decide how much
       electricity to buy and even influence how long their supply lasts. Billing is
       now widely perceived to be more transparent and commensurate to usage. An
       indirect consequence of the pay-as-you go system is that customers intuitively
       conserve power.

   •   More attention to energy efficiency and better demand-side management:
       Across the residential, business and social service categories, the single most
       cited disadvantage of the PPM is the much higher rate of billing compared to
       the old system, especially following the recent increases in single phase tariffs
       and fixed access charges. However, the hike in tariffs has pushed costumers to
       use electricity more efficiently. Specifically, most customers seem to have
       figured out that the way to minimize their PPM bills is simply to regulate the
       amount of electricity they consume. Therefore, lights and appliances are
       usually switched off whenever they are not in use. The PPMs are in fact
       promoting energy efficiency and demand-side management.
Despite the positive impacts mentioned above, some shortcomings were reported
during the assessment. Some examples include:

   •   Meter installation charges: Although meter installation charges were meant to
       be free of charge, the beneficiary assessment highlighted numerous instances
       where customers were told to pay for “wiring and connection? rather than for
       the meters. The PMU was aware of the problem and in fact posted notices
       across Karu and other intervention areas to raise awareness that there should
       be no installation charges on PPMs.

   •   Long queues to top up meters: A commonly cited issue by customers with
       PPMs were the long queues they face when they go to top up at service centers.
       At the Karu and Nyanya service centers, the average wait time per customer
       when operations are going smoothly was two minutes. However, customers
       could face a wait time anywhere between 30 minutes to a few hours if the
       telecommunication network that transmits information between the PHCN
       server and customer accounts is down. This was also observed during the ICR
       mission and discussed with the Nigerian authorities. While some of the
       communication challenges were identified as teething problems during initial
       start-up, it was recommended to increase the number of third party vendors (as
       in the case of telephone operators) to facilitate the sales of billing codes.

   •   Mixed results in partial intervention areas. As mentioned above, results were
       mixed in partial intervention areas, with project benefits not materializing as
       expected. Only rehabilitating the full electricity distribution chain from
       substation to PPMs delivers the expected results. This is important when
       considering scale-up of NEDP activities.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

No stakeholder workshop was organized specifically for this ICR. Instead,
stakeholder views were gathered during the beneficiary assessment. In addition, under
NEGIP, at least two workshops per year are organized with a broad range of
stakeholders to discuss main issues in the power and gas sector. These workshops
provide an opportunity for all stakeholders (including civil society, business
organizations, and government) to provide feedback on the reform and take an active
role in the oversight of the activities in the sector.

Annex 7. Executive Summary of Borrower's ICR (extract)
FGN gives NEDP a satisfactory overall rating, because the project delivered most of
its proposed technical outputs and achieved its most important development
objectives. The project achieved its immediate outcomes of efficiency, supply, and
service improvements; demonstration of potential models to scale-up electricity
access; and preparatory work for gas reforms and related power generation project.
NEDP has led to the emergence of stronger power companies (especially DISCOs),
policy and regulatory institutions, and rural energy access models with mixed
stakeholder participation and accountability (private, community, NGOs, and others).
Other than the direct technical improvements and financial revenue/cost savings
potentials, the investments made in transmission and distribution infrastructure
seemed to have helped in economic goals and importantly contributed to increasing
asset valuations and in attracting global capital for privatization.
Although the project had a few setbacks leading to uncertainty, time overruns and
implementation delays, including initial procurement and contract completion delays
in addition to a prolonged restructuring phase midway, finally it did manage to finish
on a satisfactory note. Also during the long run of the project (2005–12), average
inflation in Nigeria rose from about 11 to 13 percent, which might have negatively
impacted the basket of goods and services that could have been bought had the project
been implemented within its initial designated run between 2005–8.
Eight hundred and ten megavolt amperes were financed under the restructured NEDP
PAD, and recommendations after restructuring proposed an increase in the number of
clusters 14 from five to nine (details below).

NEDP: Transformers and Clusters
The project increased transformer capacity at the critical interface between
transmission and distribution by a cumulative 660 MVA, (out of total ~810 MVA
transformer capacity installed), thus helping to address an important constraint to
power quantity and quality, and impacting both tail and end-user voltages. In addition,
it provided reactive-power compensation equipment that helped improve substantially
the voltage users receive (voltage at 29 sites post-NEDP is at ~33 kV), resulting in

better quality at tail end of low voltage networks, assisting in the HVDS 15 model.
HVDS increased enhancements to service quality and distribution efficiency in well
demarcated clusters, reduced energy losses within those clusters, and increased
revenues and customer satisfaction for their respective DISCOs.
Systemic investments in transmission and distribution improvements targeting critical
interfaces within contained geographic areas and a turnkey approach to PPM
deployment not only led to quicker installation of components and completion, but
also manifested in “perceptible? improvements in power indicators at the consumer
level, that is, power availability and reliability (12–18 hours/day), loss reduction (~20
percent), and voltage quality (220 V). Perception became an important leading
indicator for customer satisfaction and PPM uptake. Visible improvements in quality
and quantity of power, consumption linked to billing, and customer service
improvements had a domino effect leading to multiple financial and economic
benefits, for example, faster awareness and mobilization at consumer levels.
Consumers proactively demanded PPM, resulting in a PPM “pull demand? instead of
“push demand? 16 (> 65,000 PPMs installed) with demand outstripping supply.
Another benefit is the positive stance toward power reforms and support of
government efforts (expecting similar outcomes like for telecoms). This is translating
into significant visible financial 17 impacts: power sales through PPM are up 1,800
percent; customers are being billed (> 65,000 new connections); revenues are up 50–
80 percent; collections are up 55 percent and rising; debt reduction in maintenance
resources and positive cash flows. There have also been several economic benefits,
for example, expanding small-scale industry units and cooperatives, rising property
markets, gender inclusion, and others. It is still early, but overall total cost of
ownership of assets should also show a significant decline in the medium and long
run.
Importantly, a gradual mind-set shift from a public sector to a private/commercial
sector and customer-services orientation at all levels at the Distribution Business Unit
(DBU) level seems to be in motion, from chief executive officers to the managers at
service centers. DBUs now compete among each other for performance-based
bonuses and O&M allocations. Consumers are happy both with power quality and
quantity and the new customer-focused approach by DBU staff, and consumers’
expectations are that power privatization will lead to even more sector improvement,
similar to the telecom sector privatization.
NEDP has also established some best practices for the sector (business models,
deployment configurations, implementation techniques, contract and bidding
documents, and technology specifications). Almost all of these are already being
replicated and scaled up by NIPP, the (state) REA, and NERC. For example,
transmission enhancement for distribution cluster configuration; PPMs; turnkey
prepayment implementation; off-grid solar; conversion from LVDS to HVDS model;
contract and procurement bidding documents; “self-protected? transformer
specifications; “loss capitalization? model for technical bid assessment; and the
business model for off-grid solar at Mfaminyen Village are becoming prototypes for

   HVDS uses several lower-capacity distribution transformers, mostly of 50 kVA, which are typically pole mounted with
therefore shorter LV lines (415/220 V).

replication. NEDP also demonstrated rural grid and off-grid electrification models
(Enugu, Cross River State, and Imo). Additionally, the technical and functional
capacity built by NEDP within PMU, PHCN, and NERC are being leveraged across
other projects and in train-the-trainer initiatives across the sector.
Government is gradually moving toward its reduced role of policy maker and planner.
The regulator, bulk trader, Market Operator, 18 successor companies of PHCN, Rural
Electrification Agency and Rural Electrification Fund and other organizations have
been established. Between 2007 and 2009, there was a slowdown from FGN’s side in
the reform process, which impacted NEDP’s objective. This led to project
restructuring in 2010, and to a change in two of the PDOs. However, in 2010, the
incumbent president took over and FGN fast forwarded the reforms and privatization
process. A Presidential Action Committee and task force was set up to drive reforms
within deadlines.
Total disbursement has reached 96 percent (85 percent disbursed, 11 percent
outstanding payments, as of June 2012) of the financing available, though FGN
disbursements did lag behind schedule throughout the project.. Around US$9.84
million are committed to component 2 under the “Outstanding Special Commitment?
provision. As of December 2011, about US$112 million have been spent on fixed
assets and about US$6 million on development operating expenditures, which
constitute major project expenditures. Overall, the project has been well managed
with adequate fiduciary and performance oversight, despite key staff changes over the
seven-year duration of project (especially in contract, procurement, and accounting).
However, even though 70 percent (about US$126 million) of funds were disbursed
before restructuring in 2010, there is no evidence of regret costs or material impact in
PDO outcomes. The investments made in initial NEDP years were (almost) completed
by 2010 (HVDS, substation transformers, and PPMs) and were instrumental in
illustrating positive outcomes and models. Further, these models were also being
replicated and scaled up by NIPP, which is running in parallel. NEDP, as a precursor,
undertook initial risks, built practices, established models that can/are being replicated
by FGN/NIPP, effectively making FGN investments, risk free. NEDP investments in
2006–9 were in various stages of installation, performance, and replication when FGN
suddenly fast-tracked the reform process in 2010. The timely investments in
infrastructure rehabilitation and reinforcement contributed to enhancing asset quality
and performance, hence, attracting global investors and increasing valuations. Further,
benefits of investment were realized immediately by FGN before depreciation
reduced values (although more work is required to quantify precisely). The NEDP
balance sheet has seen an improvement of about 15–20 percent year on year (2010–
2011). 18
Further, when the FGN scaled up its investments in the sector to enable privatization,
both NIPP and NERC replicated and adopted almost all the methods and models,
thereby leveraging learning economies and best practices already demonstrated by
NEDP. Annex 1 highlights major investments, primarily for components 1 and 2, over
the project lifetime, through transmission and distribution rehabilitation and
reinforcements that not only improved power quality and quantity delivered, but also
improved customer services, positively impacting revenue collections in target
clusters. The majority of equipment procurement and supply and installation of these

for PMU, NERC, and BPE.
The remaining 30 percent of funds (about US$45 million) offered flexibility to
quickly ramp up targeted support for reforms and implement FGN’s decision to fast
forward reforms and fund projects in transmission and contingencies (Jos-Makeri,
Alagbon). Anticipating the change in FGN strategy, the PHCN-PMU managed the
procurement process for all the remaining subcomponents, including TA that helped
in assisting and expediting implementation after restructuring. Detailed analysis by
components is in annexes 2 and 3.
