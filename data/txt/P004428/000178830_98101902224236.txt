REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE FXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO WE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR AN
INDUSTRIAL IMVESTMENT AND SMALLHOLDER TREE-
FARMERS PROJECT TtiROIJGH THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE
PHILIPPINES
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $50.0 million.
The loan would be repayable over 18 years, including 4-1/2 years of grace,
and at an interest rate of 7-1/4% per aninum. The proceeds of the loan would
be relent to the Development Bank of the Philinpines on the same terms as
those of the Bank loan for onlending to specific productive enterprises.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 79-PI4 of April 20, 1973) was circulated
to the Fxecutive Directors on May 2, 1973 (R73-85). An economic mission
visited the Philippines in April and its preliminary conclusions are
incorporated below. The full report of the mission will be distributed to
the Executive Directors in due course. Annex I contains country data.
Recent Developments
3.        Since 1972, the Government has re-formulated its development
strategy by introducing a number of important and potentially far-reaching
economic and social reforms through decrees in such areas as agrarian reform,
taxation, customs administration and tariffs, banking and government organi-
zation. These reforms provide an opportunitv to improve the performance of
the Philippine economy. Aided by the recent commodity boom in the inter-
national markets, economic activity in the Philippines has increased consid-
erably. The growth in real GNP, which had been about 5% a year for more
than a decade, is estimated to have doubled and reached 10% in 1973. However
underemployment and unemplovment remain quite high, and in common with most
other countries the rate of inflation has increased appreciably in the past
year. These problems and the long-term implications of the energy crisis
for domestic production, the balance of payments, costs and employment are
now being examined by the economic mission.
4.        The strong recovery of the economy in 1973 resulted from increased
agricultural production, a recovery in the industrial sector including
manufactured exports, a boom in export incomes and an expansion in public
and private investment. The agricultural sector, which had suffered from
adverse weather conditions during the previous three years grew by 11% in
1973. Rice production in the present crop year is estimated to have increased
bv 30% over the level of the previous year when floods reduced production
levels. This increase has been mainlv due to favorable weather conditions,
increased use of fertilizers, more supervised credit and increased investments



- 2 -
in supporting rural services as part of a general drive for rice self-
sufficienci. The Government has vigorously implemented a program of agrarian
reform amorg rice and corn tenants concentrating mainly on the larger holdings
in the first phase. Titles are being transferred to tenants and supporting
services improved.
5.        The increased activity in agriculture has provided the base for
renewed exDansion of the industrial sector. The growth of industrial produc-
tion for exports has also been stimulated by the Government's industrial
export drive which included a range of export incentives. Nontraditional
industrial exports, which have been increasing since 1970, are estimated to
have doubled in 1973 to about $200 million. The prospects of increased
profitability are attracting a large amount of new investment into industries
such as plywood, textiles and garments, handicrafts, light consumer durables
and electronics.
6.        The growth in production was also assisted by the sharply acceler-
ated public development outlays in 1973 made possible by a significant im-
provement in the financial position of the Government. The Government has
implemented a series of long-needed tax reforms and improvements in tax
administration, such as customs and tariff reform, tax amnesties, reforms
in corporate and local taxation, continuation of the export tax, and increased
taxation on luxury items and on gasoline. These reforms resulted in a 37%
increase in tax revenues in FY 1973, and an estimated 40% this fiscal year.
As a result the ratio of Central Government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9% in recent years to an estimated 12% this fiscal year.
7.        High prices for the Philippines' chief exports, including coconut
products, sugar, copper and wood products, were largely responsible for an
increase in merchandise receipts of almost 70% in 1973. The merchandise
trade account recorded a surplus of about $270 million, as compared with a
$120 million deficit in the previous year.    International reserves rose by
$594 million during the year and stood at $876 million, equivalent to about
five months of imports, at the end of the year.
8.        However, in the latter part of 1973 inflation emerged as a major
problem in the Philippines. Since mid-1973 consumer prices have been rising
at an annual rate of more than 40%. This has been caused by the higher rate
of world inflation, by higher export prices, by domestic food shortages,
and more recently by the increased cost of petroleum. Provided the Government
obtains sufficient cereal imports for the coming July-September lean period
for domestic supplies, and provided there is a good harvest later in the
year, the rate of inflation should moderate in 1975, but it probably will
take 1-2 years for the price effects of the energy crisis to work themselves
out fully. The rapid inflation has also exacerbated the decline in real
wages which fell by a total of about 25% between 1969 and 1973. The urban
wage earners have been most affected. In the past year, agricultural incomes
have improved verv substantially, while, with some exceptions, entrepreneurs
have been able to pass on increased costs. Money wages will have to be
raised in the near future if further deterioration in the living standards of
wage earners is to be avoided.



-3-
The Energy Crlsis
9.        Imported petroleum provides some 93% of the Philippines' total
energy requirements. In 1973 the equivalent of 71 million barrels of
petroleum crude and other petroleum products were imported at a cost of
about $230 million c.i.f. When the energy crisis developed late last year,
it looked as though economic activity in the Philippines would be severely
disrupted. There were temporary dislocations while reduced quantities of
petroleum were available, but the Government moved quickly with conservation
measures to reduce non-essential consumption. By March these problems had
been overcome and the Philippines is now obtaining sufficient petroleum for
its needs. In 1974 imports of petroleum and products are likely to be about
73 million barrels at a cost of about $820 million c.i.f.
10.       In response to the energy crisis the Government has decided to
accelerate the development of local energy sources, especially hydropower
and geothermal energy. These will be supplemented with nuclear energy in
the 1980's. The transport sector, which now accounts for 40% of total
energy consumption, is likely to continue to be the major consumer of energy.
The growth in demand for energy will therefore be influenced by policies
that affect the pattern of expansion in this sector. In any event, total
demand for energy is expected to grow at about 10 percent a year, and even
with more rapid development of natural power sources, petroleum would still
account for 85% of total energy needs by 1980. The Philippines does not
have any commercial oil fields, but the Government has recently taken steps
to encourage more exploration.
Growth Prospects
11.       Earlier this year the Government decided that, despite the energy
crisis and ranid inflation, the growth momentum built up last year should be
maintained, to provide for a continued increase in employment and to ensure
that export income expands rapidly enough to meet most of the country's
foreign exchange needs. The labor force will continue to grow at almost 3%
a year for .nother decade. Providing half a million new jobs a year as well
as dealing with unemployment and underemployment will be a major task.
12.       The economy has the potential to continue growing at 7-8% a year
in real terms. This growth is not likely to be seriously constrained by lack
of foreign exchange, for despite the big increase in the cost of petroleum
and other imports, continued high prices for major export commodities will
result in another overall balance of payments surplus this year. Moreover,
the rapid increase in export prices at a time when external debt has not been
changing, has resulted in a sharp fall in debt service from 23% of export
earnings in 1972 to an estimated 14% this year. There has also been a sub-
stantial improvement in the climate for private investment in the Philippines,
especially in exports. Unless there is a calamitous drop in export prices,
the Philippines should be able to maintain a reasonable balance of payments
position throughout the rest of the decade.    There will probably be a substan-
tial increase in financing requirements, but with rising domestic incomes and



- 4 -
a substantially improved capacity to borrow abroad, it should be possible
to mobilize the needed resources.
13.       A substantial increase in both public and private investment to
support the growth and employment strategy is required, with priority being
given to increasing food production, to export ventures and to selective
import-replacing investments. The Government plans to spend about P 17 bil-
lion on infrastructure and other public investments during FY 1974-77; about
40% of the proposed investment program would be allocated to the transport
sector, 21% to power and 13% to irrigation. This would mean doubling the pro-
portion of these expenditures to GNP from 1.7% in FY 1968-72 to about 3.5%
in FY 1974-77. To finance this program, the ratio of taxes to GNP would
have to be increased to 15-16%, and public savings would have to be raised
from the present level of 1.4% of GNP to beyond 2% in the next few years.
With the Government's program for further tax reforms, there are reasonable
prospects for achieving these objectives. Even so, it would mean continued
heavy reliance on public borrowing from the local market and from abroad.
Implementing this program would also call for continued improvements in
public sector management which has already been strengthened by the Government
reorganization.
14.       The improved climate for private investment is attributable to the
strong performance of the economy in 1973 after three years of stagnation,
the current higher prices for many commodities, and the efforts of Govern-
ment to attract more foreign investment. A number of big projects are proposed
in mining, wood processing, fertilizer, steel, aluminum and other industries
which seem likely to push up the private investment rate from recent levels
of about 167 of GNP to perhaps 22% by the latter part of the decade. A large
portion of the funds for these projects is likely to come from abroad. Even
so, the supplv of long-term funds from domestic sources will need to increase
substantially.
Balance of Payments
15.       Because of continued high prices for major export commodities, ex-
port receipts are expected to increase by 33% this year to $2.5 billion.
Merchandise imports are likely to increase bv about 66% to $2.6 billion,
largelv because of the increased cost of petroleum. In response to the
energy crisis the Central Bank negotiated a series of standby credits with
various foreign commercial banking grouns earlier this year. However, be-
cause of the improved outlook for export receipts, these standby credits may
not be used this year. The economic mission estimates that the overall
balance of payments will record a surplus of about $250 million this year,
with international reserves increasing to about $1.1 billion, the equivalent
of ahout 3-1/2 months of imports. With export prices continuing at relatively
high levels, a small deficit in the overall balance of payments is likely
in 1975.



- 5 -
16.       After allowing for continued reserve accumulation and repayment of
loans, the zotal foreign exchange requiements for the period 1975-79 would
be about $7 billion. About $2.5 billion would be provided by remittances,
official grants, direct investment, and short-term trade finance. The re-
maining $4.5 billion would have to come from foreign borrowing. Last year
the Bank estimated total requirements for 1974-78 at about $4 billion. In
June 1973 thie Consultative Group for the Philippines met and accepted the
need for rising levels of commitments for development projects to support the
Philippines' increased development program. The increased estimate of re-
quirements reflects the effects of inflation, the more optimistic outlook for
growth in the Philippines, and the improved capacity to carry foreign debt.
17.       Borrowing on this scale would not pose serious problems for balance
of payments and external debt management. At the end of 1973, the Philippines'
medium and long-term external debt stood at about $1.9 billion, of which pub-
lic debt was 44%. Because the Government has exercised strict control over
the amount and type of new external borrowings, the total amount of debt out-
standing has not increased much since 1970, and the maturity structure has
improved. Moreover, the debt service ratio is expected to remain at about
14% in 1975. With this moderate debt burden the Philippines will be able to
contract substantially larger amounts of external debt which would probably
lead to a small increase in the debt service ratio, perhaps to about 14-15%
by the earlv 1980s.
18.       The Philippines' development program will continue to require re-
sources in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for fi-
nancing the import component of development projects. Some financing of local
currency expenditures will be justified, especially for projects of economic
and social importance which need only limited amounts of foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
19.       The Philippines has received 23 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $394 million, net of cancellations. About 56% of the Bank/IDA
lending or about $225 million has been for infrastructure projects in power,
transportation, water supply and for education. The remainder has been
divided between agriculture and industry. About $104 million of this has
been for irrigation, livestock, fisheries, rice processing and rural credit
and about $65 million for industry in three loans to the Private Development
Corporation of the Philippines.  There has been a marked improvement in the
way Bank Group projects in the Philippines have been executed in the last
two or three years compared with experience in the 1960's when shortages
of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration caused serious
problems. Apart from the rice processing project, where the scope of the
project has been revised because of changed circumstances (see Annex II),
all our projects are now going well.   Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1974 and IFC investments as of
Mlarch 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



- 6 -
20.       The size of the Bank's lending program will increase substantially
this year reflecting the ambitious development program of the Government and
its improved capacity to prepare and implement projects. With the loans for
the proposed project and for the third rural credit project being presented
to the Executive Directors in June, our lending in FY 1974 would be $165.1
million, compared to an average of about $30 million a year in the previous
five years. Future Bank lending will continue to concentrate on public infra-
structure and agriculture. We will also continue to help industry and pro-
vide more assistance for projects in the social sectors.
21.       The following projects are among those which may be ready for Board
consideration in FY 75 - Population, Power VI, Inter-Island Shipping, Tarlac
Irrigation, Mindoro Rural Development and Small Industry.    The population
project would strengthen the delivery of family planning and other health
services to the rural areas, mainly by constructing and staffing new rural
health units. The sixth power loan would help the National Power Corporation
(NPC) to expand its power generating and transmission facilities in Luzon,
while the loan for inter-island shipping would be relent through DBP to
private shipping companies for the acquisition of new and used ships and con-
version and repairs of existing ships of the inter-island fleet. The Tarlac
Irrigation project would help rehabilitate irrigation systems in a heavily
tenanted area of Central Luzon, while the Rural Development project would
help finance a range of rural investments designed to promote the integrated
development of the island of Mindoro. The small industry loan would provide
funds for relending to small firms and technical assistance to help strengthen
the institutions serving these firms.
22.       Since 1972 the Philippines has received a limited amount of assist-
ance from IDA, but on the basis of a reappraisal of the prospects for the
Philippines' balance of payments in the light of changes in commodity prices,
and in view of the sharply increased needs of the poorer members of IDA for
concessional assistance, further IDA lending to the Philippines does not
appear to be justified. The Philippines now has the capacity to borrow
larger amounts abroad to meet the needs of the increased investment program
now planned. The Bank's share in this higher level of foreign borrowing
will be reviewed in the light of the findings of the recent economic mission.
At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is about 9% and its
share in debt service is about 5.5%. Since the Philippines will have the
capacity to service more commercial debt in future, it is unlikely that the
Bank's share in debt service will rise even with a higher level of lending.
23.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $68.0 mil-
lion for investments in ten companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of March 31, 1974, $18.2 million have been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $1.6 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $47.8 million. On the
same date $13.2 million was undisbursed. Preliminary proposals have been
received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in the pulp and paper,
dinner ware, metal alloys and shipbuilding fields.

PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
24.       Industry (manufacturing, mining and construction) is the third
largest sector in the Philippine economy (after agriculture and services).
It accounted for 27% of net domestic product in 1973, absorbing over one-
third of total fixed investment and providing employment for 15% of the
total labor force. Since the early 1970's Government has placed increasing
emphasis on industrial growth to expand and diversify exports, meet growing
domestic demand, and provide increased employment opportunities.
25.       Manufacturing, which accounts for over two-thirds of all indus-
trial activity, is predominantly privately owned, and generally concentrated
in large scale, vertically integrated, capital-intensive units. In 1971,
organized manufacturing enterprises with fewer than 20 employees accounted
for 85% of the number of enterprises but for less than 17% of industrial
employment, 4.7% of value added and 5.5% of total assets of manufacturing
enterprises. By sectors, food and beverages are the largest group, with
chemicals and petrochemicals second and textiles ranking third. Geographic-
ally, over 65% of manufacturing enterprises are concentrated in the greater
Manila and southern Luzon area, although more recently increasing industrial-
ization has been taking place in northern Mindanao and the Visayas.
26.       Philippine industrial production has up to now been geared pri-
marily toward meeting the needs of the domestic consumer market. Reliance
on the industrial sector as a major vehicle for enhancing export earnings
is a relatively recent development signalled by the introduction of the
Export Incentives Act in 1970 and by other policy measures such as the float-
ing of the peso resulting in a sizable devaluation which made Philippine in-
dustrial exports much more competitive in international markets. The rapid
increase in industrial exports in the last two years reflects both the suc-
cess of these measures and favorable changes in world market demand for
Philippine products. The encouraging performance so far has led the Govern-
ment into establishing a special duty-exempt Export Processing Zone at
Mariveles to attract foreign and domestic investment into manufacturing for
export.
27.       Both the Export Incentives Act and the earlier Investment Incen-
tives Act of 1967, which reformed the previous cumbersome structure of in-
centives, are administered by the Board of Investments (BOI) - the principal
industrial regulatory agency. Its main functions are to: (a) issue an annual
Investment Priorities Plan (IPP) - the current IPP is the sixth - listing
those industries or product lines which qualify for incentives; (b) determine
the additional capacity required in these industries to meet domestic demand
and/or take advantage of export possibilities; and (c) approve individual
projects in line with the annual IPP. The BOI also draws up a list of
"overcrowded industries" in which further investments are discouraged by
denying access to incentives and foreign exchange for imports. In addition
to its regulatory functions, BOI is an active promotional agency, which



- 8 -
undertakes specific industry and market studies, and publishes information
useful to industrialists. About one-half of new industrial investment in
the Philinpines goes into BOI-registered projects. Between June 1968 and
June 30, 1973, BOI approved 250 projects requiring a total investment of
$1.1 billion. W4hile BOI is primarily responsible for regulating investment,
industrial policy formulation is the responsibility of the National Economic
and Development Authority (NEDA). A newly established Department of Energy
and Industry (DEI) (expected to be in full operation by mid 1974) will also
play a prominent role in coordinating industrial policy formulation and im-
plementation, covering whatever gaps exist under the present institutional
arrangements.
28.       Tne Four-Year Development Plan for FY74-77 estimates total indus-
trial investment in the period to be in excess of $3 billion. Investment in
manufacturing is expected to account for about two-thirds of the total.
This level of investment will require a large increase in domestic resource
mobilization, as well as a sustained inflow of foreign capital on reasonable
terms.
29.       Two institutions, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP),
the government's principal development financing institution, and the Private
Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP) are the main providers of
long-term industrial finance. DBP is much the larger of the two. Foreign
commercial borrowings guaranteed by domestic financial intermediaries (princi-
Dally DBP) have in the past accounted for 30-35% of investment in manufactur-
ing. These guarantees have in the last three years been subject to stringent
Central Bank regulations designed to ensure appropriate terms.     Besides DBP
and PDCP, several commercial banking and other financial institutions also
provide term finance to industry, covering less than 5% of total needs.
Working capital needs are covered mainly by commercial banks, which in 1973
provided $3.1 billion in domestic credit, half of which went to the manufactur-
ing sector. The remaining gaps in financing are covered by internally-generated
funds and byr equity financing through the capital market.
30.       For some years we have been exploring with the Government whether
we could chalnnel funds for industrial investment projects through DBP to
suoplement 'Bank Group financing provided through PDCP.   Lending through DBP
for industr-,al sub-projects raises somewhat broader institutional issues
than our three agricultural loans made through DBP for Rice Processing, Live-
stock and Fisheries. In the case of the agricultural projects, the relending
activities c:ould be well defined in advance and restricted in scope. Indus-
trial relencling involves a far wider range of activities and, hence, greater
reliance on DBP's judgement and competence in the selection, appraisal and
supervision of sub-projects. We therefore agreed with the Government to
postpone our first industrial operation through DBP until DBP's operating
capability had improved to a point where we had no reservations about its
ability to use the funds to finance projects of high economic priority.
This point has now been reached and the project described below represents a
fuirther stage in our developing relationship with DBP.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       The proposed loan follows a series of four Bank Group loans for
financing industrial investment in the Philippines through the privately-
owned Private Development Corporation of the Philippines (PDCP). The most
recent of these was a $15.0 million loan from IFC in 1973. A Bank mission
appraised the project in January 1974 and negotiations were held in April
1974. The leader of the Government's negotiating team was Undersecretary
of Finance Mr. Pio de Roda. The Appraisal Report (No. 424-PH) on the project
is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Annex III
provides a loan and project summary.
32.       The proposed loan of $50.0 million includes $48.0 million for
industrial financing and $2.0 million for the pilot tree-farming project.
The purpose of the industrial portion of the loan is to finance direct
imports for medium and relatively large industrial sub-projects. Recent
Government initiatives (see paras 25 and 26) have laid a sound basis for
the industrial sector to play an important role in furthering Government
income, employment and export policies. As noted earlier a possible Bank
loan to assist small industry is being discussed with the Government and
may be presented to the Executive Directors in FY 1975.
33.       The proceeds of the loan would be onlent by DBP.    The Government
attaches great importance to DBP as a principal source of finance for
Philippine industries. A second purpose of the loan is to enable the Bank,
through normal advice and guidance, to help DBP improve the standards of its
operation in such areas as project appraisal and follow-up, financial plan-
ning and audit.
34.       DBP was established in 1958 as a wholly Government-owned develop-
ment bank. It operates in all important sectors of the economy, although
industrial financing in the past accounted for the bulk (79%) of its total
financing, followed by agricultural financing (9%), with the balance of 12%
going for municipal lending, lending to private development banks and for
real estate. Apart from retained earnings, DBP's principal domestic source
of funds is the Government. It does not have any foreign exchange resources
specifically for relending, and therefore has been financing industry mainly
by guaranteeing foreign supplier credits. Its financing is made in the form
of loans, guarantees and equity investments. DBP's financing in the past
four years accounted for 11% of total fixed investment in the Philippines
and its industrial financing for 28% of total investment in the industrial
sector. Because of the size of its financing and the wide variety of its
activities, DBP has played and is expected to continue to play a central role
in the economic development of the Philippines.
35.       DBP's present management has endeavored, with some success, to
reorganize the institution and to raise the standards of its operations.
DBP's Industrial Department, which woulcd have the main responsibility for
handling sub-projects to be financed uncler the proposed loan, was recently



- 10 -
reorganized and now has the capability to undertake thorough and detailed
project appraisal. DBP also draws upon BOI's high quality project evaluation
work (see pars 26). DBP's tollow-up work is still weak but more systematic
follow-up procedures are now 'Oeing introduced.   DBP's management plans to
increase the staff of the Industrial Department by adding 25 professionals,
with a view to further strengthening appraisal and follow-up work. To lay
down sound guidelines for its industrial financing, DBP has agreed with the
Bank a Statement of Operating Policies and Procedures which has now been
adopted (see Section 3.03 of the Loan Agreement). This will supplement the
policy guidelines provided by DBP's charter. To improve financial planning
DBP established a Financial Planning Conmittee in September 1973 primarily
to prepare three-year business forecasts and financial projections. With
these improvements underway and to be continued, DBP has the operational
capability to make good use of Bank funds for industrial projects.
36.       In the recent past 80% of the industrial projects financed by DBP
have been registered with BOI under either the Investment Incentives Act or
the Export Incentives Act. DBP has financed a wide range of industrial
activities, including food manufacturing, paper, cement, textiles and the
engineering industry. It is expected that an even higher proportion of the
proceeds of this loan would go to BOI-registered projects which are increasing-
ly labor intensive and export oriented. BOI's project evaluation work is
of high quality, and this plus DBP's own appraisal work and the Bank's review
of sub-projects, will ensure that Bank funds go to industrial projects which
are economi:ally as well as financially sound.
37.       D3P has experienced severe financial difficulties in recent years
principally because heavy debt service obligations were incurred as a result
of guarante-ing a large amount of private foreign borrowing between 1965 and
1970. These prohlems arose partly because DBP's appraisal work was weak,
partly because many foreign suppliers' credits guaranteed by DBP had excess-
ively short maturities and partly because many borrowers defaulted after the
de facto peso devaluation in February 1970 leaving DBP to make good on its
guarantees. Since then, DBP's appraisal standards have been considerably
improved, and the Central Bank has established guidelines to ensure that
foreign credits made to Philippine companies have appropriate terms. Despite
some recent improvement, which is expected to continue, DBP's arrears remain
serious. But they now relate mainly to those foreign currency guarantees
made bv DBP prior to the de facto devaluation of 1970. As of June 30, 1973,
total arrears on the total loan portfolio, including interest, amounted to
about $84 million or 24% of the portfolio. Defaults on guarantees currently
falling due are now at a level of 61% compared with a level of about 80%
during the previous two years.   S'ich defaults amounted to $278 million as of
June 30, 1973, of which $79 million had been repaid and a further $42
million converted into long-term loans, leaving a balance of $157 million
outstanding. To reduce arrears further, DBP intends to undertake an
account-by-account examination of the portfolio industrial loans and guarantees
in arrears, so that management can take appropriate action.
38.       DBP's accounts are audited by Government auditors whose reports,
although thorough in some respects, do not cover certain essential aspects
of DEP's financial condition, namely, the condition of the portfolio and the



- 11 -
adequacy of provisions made for doubtful accounts. It is not possible,
therefore, to make a precise judgment on DBP's financial condition. Because
of this deficiency, it has been considered more appropriate to make the
present loan to the Government, for relending to DBP, rather than directly
to DBP. The Bank would provide an auditing expert to help DBP identify the
main weaknesses in its existing audit system and develop, in collaboration
with the Commission on Audit, a program of action to achieve appropriate
improvements. The Bank would also assist DBP with a training program involv-
ing visits by DBP officers and auditors to selected Development Finance
Companies. It is hoped that with this assistance, DBP in future will reach a
point where it can borrow directly from the Bank.
39.       T)IP expects to commit industrial loans and guarantees totalling
$350 million during the two-year period from July 1, 1974. This excludes
some mining projects (requiring very heavy investment). The proposed Bank
loan would provide about 15% of DBP's foreign currency resources required for
industrial financing during that period. DBP would finance the balance
required from abroad mainly by guaranteeing foreign suppliers' credits, as
it has done in the past. It is expected that, as in the past, the Government
will continue to provide DBP with the resources required both to sustain a
desirable volume of financing and to meet DBP's debt service requirements.
40.       The proposed loan of $50.0 million, including the pilot tree-
farming component, would be made to the Government, which would relend the
proceeds on the Bank terms to DBP under a subsidiary loan agreement. This
procedure has been used under three previous Bank loans through DBP for
agriculture. $48.0 million would be for foreign exchange costs of indus-
trial sub-projects, and $2.0 million for local costs of the tree-farming
project. The loan would be for a term of 18 years, including a grace period
of 4-1/2 years. The relending rate, charged by DBP to sub-borrowers, is
exnected to be 12% per annum, the legal maximum rate for secured loans in
the Philippines. The Government is considering now raising the ceiling on
interest rates, because of the rapid rate of inflation. If interest rates
are raised for medium and long term loans, DBP would raise the relending rate
to sub-borrowers accordingly. Industrial sub-loans would be committed over
two years and disbursed over four years. They would be for a maximum term
of 16 years. Sub-borrowers would assume the foreign exchange risk on the
currencies of the countries from which goods and services are procured. The
Government would bear any residual exchange risk between the currency of
procurement and the currency of obligation. A ceiling of $5 million would
be set for any industrial sub-loan made by DBP under the proposed loan (see
Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement). Industrial sub-loans of under $1 million
w¢ould be made without the Bank's prior approval up to a total of $20 million
of lending in this category. Based on the average size of DBP's industrial
projects, it is estimated that with this free limit about one-half by number
or three-fourths by amount of DBP's industrial sub-loans would require the
Bank's prior approval.
41.       Approximately $2.0 million of the total loan would be used by
DBP to finance a pilot tree farming project for about 1,300 participating
smailholders in Mindanao.   Sub-loans would be committed over four years and



- 12 -
disbursed over seven. Each sub-loan would be for a term of 15 years, in-
cluding eight years of grace. All expenditures under the tree farming proj-
ect are local costs. The Government will assume the full exchange risk on
the $2.0 million amount for this pilot project to be onlent by DBP to small-
holders in pesos. The smallholders as beneficiaries would make a minimum
contribution of 25% of sub-project cost by providing their own labor. This
element in the project would have been too small to warrant a separate loan.
It would be the first time in any country that Bank financing would be pro-
vided for smallholder wood producing farms and would provide useful experi-
ence for similar projects in the Philippines and elsewhere in the world.
The project calls for the planting of a fast-growing pulpwood species (Albizia
falcata) which takes about eight years to mature. The pulpwood would be pur-
chased by the Paper Industries Corporation of the Philippines (PICOP), which
would also provide seedlings (at cost) and technical assistance to smallhold-
ers. PICOP maintains a well-organized and well-staffed Agro-Forestry Depart-
ment with extension offices throughout the project area. It is providing
this assistance under the terms of an agreement with DBP. This pilot proj-
ect is expected to make a substantial contribution to the annual income of
the smallholders concerned. At prices presently paid by PICOP, the financial
rate of return on a tree farm is estimated at 21% and the economic rate of
return at about 14%. To ensure an adequate income to smallholders, and ef-
fective project implementation, the existing agreement between DBP and PICOP
is being revised with particular emphasis on a suitable minimum stumpage price,
to be renegotiated annually, and the provision of technical assistance and
seedlings by PICOP to the tree-farmers (see Sections 3.05 and 3.06 of the Loan
Agreement). DBP would also employ a qualified forester to help implement
the nroject.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Renort of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. The loan would not become effective until a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement was concluded between the Government and DBP.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 607-PH      Second Rural Credit; US$12.5 million Loan of
June 4, 1969; Closing Date: June 30. 1974
The slow progress of the project at the beginning was mainly
due to the steep rise in the prices of farm machinery after the peso was
allowed to float in February 1970. The subsequent increases in prices of
farm produce together with decentralization of loan approvals, strengthen-
ing of staff and promotional efforts have helped improve the pace of
disbursement. This has particularly quickeued over the last nine months.
The Closing Date, originally March 31, 1973, has been postponed to
June 30, 1974. As of March 25, 1974, a balance of only $42,450 remained
uncommitted.
Ln. No. 637-PH      Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan of August 18, 1969;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly 77,000 hectares. The project's
on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irrigation
development in the country. Some delays were caused by the 1972 floods
but construction of the dam is now progressing ahead of schedule. All
work is expected to be completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30,
1976, the original completion date. Project costs have increased 34 percent
over appraisal estimates largely due to inflation, devaluation of the peso
and design changes in the dam. However, as a result of close coordination
established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services, the
project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion
of construction instead of 13 years as appraised. The project remains
economically viable.
Ln. No. 720-PH      Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, L1975
This project provides long-term credit through the Development Bank
of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modernization
of the private sector of the rice processing industry. It included six large
integrated processing plants to produce the high quality rice required for
the anticipated exportable surplus, which did not materialize owing to set-
backs in rice production. The President's memorandum to the Executive
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6 pages
Directors dated June 8, 1972 (R72-40) proposed anmendments to the loan
agreement to shift the emphasis to rehabilitation of existing facilities
and to streamline procurement procedures.    In spite of this the project
has made very little progress and by the end of February 1974, only
US$0.5 million had been disbursed.    During the critical shortage of rice
last year the Government successfully encouraged an increase in maize
production, and the ccnsumption of maize mixed with rice.    This has led to
a demand for maize processing, storage and handling facilities, and
Government has proposed the project be expanded to include grains other
than rice.   Much of the new demand will come from public entities and
small individuals, so that Government has proposed they also be included,
and that the minimum size of sub-loan be reduced to cover the smaller
processors.   These ame-ndments, designed to widen the project's objectives,
to cover the changed conditions and to facilitate speedy and full
implementation, were presented to the Executive Directors in the President's
Memorandum dated April 15, 1974 (Sec M7h-2h4).    The Executive Directors
approved the proposals and the Loan Agreement has been amended accordingly.
Ln No 731-PH    Highway;  US $8.0 million Loan of April 1h, 1971;
Closing Date: May 15, ]975
The project for the construction and improvement of the Cotabato-
Digos road (160 km) in Mindanao is in general progressing satisfactorily.
Work was suispended in March 1973 because of civil disturbances in the
Cotabato area, but the contractor has since resumed work from the Digos
end which is outside the area affected by the fighting.    The project also
includes two components financed by UNDP: technical assistance to the
Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for operational improvements and feasibility
studies for future highway projects.   Work on the technical assistance
component is progressing well and the feasibility studies have been
completed.
Ln No 809-PH and   Fifth Power;   US $22.0 million and US $10.0 million loan
Cr No 296-PH       and Credit of April 3, 1972;   Closing date:  June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon.    The project is behind schedule because
procurement has taken longer than expected.    The Closing Date has been
postponed to June 30, 1978 to allow time for delayed procurement and because
retention monies will not be paid to the major equipment supplier until
at least one year after the plant is commissioned.    A tariff increase was
imposed in January 1973 because of rapid domestic inflation.    The situation
has also been improved by the imposition in July 1973 of a surcharge to
cover increased fuel costs.   A further tariff increase has been approved,
effective July 1, 1974 and this should enable NPC to achieve its covenanted
rate of return in FY 74/75.
