Health-care waste includes all the waste generated          regarded as hazardous. Other waste streams generated
by health-care establishments, research facilities and      by health-care facilities could include reusable medical
laboratories. In addition, it includes waste originating    equipment, condemned equipment and secondary
from “minor? or “scattered? sources such as that            waste created through disposal technologies.

  Specifications for a waste burial pit9
   1.	 A pit or trench should be dug about 2 meters deep. It should be half-filled with waste, and then covered
       with lime up to 50 cm of the surface, before filling the rest of the pit with soil.
   2.	 Animals should not have any access to the waste burial sites. Covers of galvanized iron/wire meshes may
       be used to protect the area from trespassing.
   3.	 On each occasion, when wastes are added to the pit, a layer of 10 cm of soil shall be added to cover the
       wastes.
   4.	 Waste disposal into the pits should be performed under close and dedicated supervision.
   5.	 The deep burial site should be relatively impermeable and no shallow well should be close to the site.
   6.	 The pits should be distant from habitation, and sited so as to ensure that no contamination occurs of any
       surface water or ground water. The area should not be prone to flooding or erosion.
   7.	 The location of the deep burial site should be authorized by the prescribed authority.
   8.	 The institution should maintain a record of the kind of waste sent for deep burial.
