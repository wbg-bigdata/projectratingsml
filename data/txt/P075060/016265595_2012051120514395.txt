                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This project supports the Second Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) II program of the Government of India, also supported by other development partners. The program has made
                         progress towards key outcomes in terms of increased access to deliveries by skilled birth attendants, children fully immunized, and increased access to family planning. However,
                         concerns remain about the quality of care in delivery of RCH services and the near stagnant rates for the use of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) in management of diarrhea. The
                         program as well as the Bank support to it ends on the 31st March, 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The 8th Joint Review Mission held in July 2011 and the fifth Common Review Mission held in December 2011, measured performance in terms of results and implementation
                         progress since 2005 as well as lessons learnt for the next plan period. The key findings are available in these reports, which were also shared in a dissemination event held in
                         January 2012.

                         The 8th Joint Review Mission made the following key recommendations going forward to the next five year plan, including amongst others : (i) all technical divisions related to RCH at
                         the central level should continue to remain under a single administrative authority given the positive experience during the last year; (ii) the MOHFW should consider expanding the
                         “results based financing? approach in the next five year plan cycle in a phased manner as it makes a more efficient use of funds as well as provides the impetus to achieve the
                         necessary results; (iii) MoHFW should continue to use HMIS and MCTS data in the state program reviews; this would encourage states to do the same and accelerate the validation
                         and use of data for monitoring and planning purposes; (iv) the state’s comprehensive training plan (CTP) needs to be further strengthened to ensure that training plans are aligned
                         with facility operationalization priorities and take into account training capacities in both public and private sectors; (v) states should focus on developing evidence-based BCC
                         strategies and prioritize the range of behaviours they should target. A Monitoring and Evaluation framework for BCC needs to be established; and, (vi) Quality Assurance framework
                         needs to be strengthened further to improve the quality of RCH services.
