MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Yemen for SDR15.7 million (US$24.3 million equivalent) to help
finance a vocational training project. The credit would be extended on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years.
2.    COUNTRY BACKGROUND. The unification of Yemen in 1990 opened new opportunities for
development. The border between North and South disappeared, government controls in the South were
replaced by market forces, and liberal economic policies opened the country to foreign investors. This
has led to a surge in oil and gas exploration and exports which together with the resumption of limited
labor emnigration to Arab oil countries will provide resources for economic growth in the second half of
the '90s. The Government is now preparing an economic reform program designed to reduce fiscal
deficits, ease price controls, and increase reliance on the private sector. With the expected revival of the
economy there will be an increasing demand for skilled labor in a variety of categories. To meet this
demand a sustained effort is needed to upgrade the quality of Yemen's labor force.
3.    THE EDUCATION SECTOR. Since the early 1970s, successive governments of Yemen have
given high priority to education development. Enrollment in primary schools reached 1.8 million in
1992/93, a tenfold increase since 1970/71. Virtually all boys and about 40 percent of the girls are now
receiving primary education; adult literacy rose from 27% in 1973 to 39% in 1990, with marked
improvement in female literacy from about 8% to 26%; during the period 1970-91 the percentage of age
cohort enrolled in primary school improved from 22 to 76 with female enrollments increasing from 7 to
37; and the number of expatriate teachers in the school system reduced from 80% in 1980 to some 10%
in 1993 (UNESCO data). Enrollment in secondary schools is also high - close to 600 thousand in
1992/93 (30 % enrollment rate), a twelvefold increase since 1970-71 - while more than 100 thousand
students were registered in teacher training institutes and the country's two universities. By contrast, less
than 6,000 students were enrolled in vocational training centers (VTCs) of which 4,900 were trained for
employment in industry and commerce, with an annual output of some 2,100 graduates.
4.    The Government's strategy for education and training is concentrating on meeting the basic
education needs of a growing population; strengthening programs for human capital formation to generate
needed labor skills; and improving gender equity in access to education and training. While in the past
education was viewed as the sole responsibility of the public sector, the Government now favors private
sector participation in all educational streams, including vocational and technical training.
5.    DEMAND FOR SKILLED WORKERS. Present employment in industrial and commercial firms
is close to 50 thousand. Another 100 thousand workers are employed in small-scale production and
service industries. Assuming an annual attrition rate of three percent, there would be around 4,500 job
openings a year. In addition, the total number of projects licensed for all governorates are 1,200 with
investments of over USS2.0 billion. According to General Investment Authority's (GIA) data on Sana'a,
about 543 new projects in industry, services, agriculture, tourism and fisheries sectors have been
approved in the last two years; of these, some 230 projects are already starting up. In the next three to
five years, the projects starting up in Sana'a alone are expected to generate some 28 thousand jobs.
Most of the workers needed to fill the new job openings will require vocational training (VT) attuned to
specific demands of local and regional labor markets.
6.    VOCATIONAL TRAINING SYSTEM (VTS): Formal VT started in 1972 and as needs for
skilled manpower increased in the industrial, commercial, agriculture and health sectors, additional



2
training institutions were established by a variety of public sector agencies with some support from donor
agencies. Currently, there are 22 VTCs -- offering pre-employment programs in industrial (13),
commerce (2), agriculture (1) and health (6). In addition, four public sector corporations and four private
companies offer in-service programs for their own employees. The major providers for VT are Ministry
of Education - MOE (8) and Ministry of Social Security, Social Services and Labor - MSSL (6).
Training for the handicapped is provided at some 19 centers. Adult education and training is provided at
over 40 centers through NGOs, private sector institutions, MOE, MSSL, Ministry of Health (MOH) and
through local councils for development.
7.    At present, the VT system is unable to meet the skill demands of employers. The main issues
are: (a) Sector Management. VTCs are managed by public agencies with virtually no inputs from the
private sector and local communities; (b) Sector Financing. Centers operate under severe financial
constraints causing shortages of instructional material, equipment, and training material; and (c) Ouality
and Relevance of VT Programs. Inadequate teacher training, poor maintenance of equipment, lack of
skill assessment, and outdated curricula not geared to the needs of industry and business have contributed
to the deterioration of VT programs. Moreover, there are regional imbalances in access to vocational
training, and female participation is low. The issues of community involvement, financing, and quality
and relevance of training are equally applicable to programs for the handicapped and adults.
8.    RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT. Based on the Human Development Study' IDA's
sector strategy is focussing on helping the Yemeni Government to: (a) improve learning achievements in
primary and secondary schools, and increase access for girls; (b) develop more effective VT programs to
upgrade the skill profile of the labor force; and (c) make higher education more responsive to labor
market needs. This strategy is consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (discussed by the board
on July 9, 1992 when the Basic Education Project was approved) which interalia supports human
resources development, and recognizes the need for skilled manpower development. In late 1993, the
Government requested IDA assistance for a major overhaul of the VT system. IDA's positive response to
such a request was justified by its long term involvement and leadership in the education sector. IDA's
participation and partnership with other external agencies would help to address major policy issues such
as governance, funding and private sector participation. It would also support economic reconstruction
efforts by ensuring a steady flow of well-trained workers to fill new job openings.
9.    LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS IDA INVOLVEMENT. The proposed project would be the next
logical step in IDA's long experience with Yemen's education and training system. Over the past two
decades, IDA has supported 15 education projects in Yemen - including four in the South, eight in the
North and three in the united country - with a total financial commitment of about US$183 million. Ten
projects have been completed while the others are at various stages of implementation. The earlier
operations, with the exception of a technical training project, focussed on primary and secondary teacher
training, adult education programs, capacity development in the MOE, and other aspects related to the
quantitative expansion of school education experienced throughout the 1970s and 1980s. IDA assistance
contributed to these improvements of education indicators (para. 3). Recently, more attention has been
given to gender equity, quality enhancement and training of skilled manpower. Nine of the ten completed
projects have achieved most of their stated objectives. However, serious delays in project implementation
began in 1989, slowing disbursements. The delays were caused mainly by political tensions following the
unification of Yemen in 1990, and by unrealistic exchange rates which made implementation of civil
works contracts difficult. New payment procedures for local civil works contracts to offset price
escalation during construction have been established. This change is showing improvements in
disbursements for ongoing projects.

10.   Lessons from previous projects have been considered in designing the proposed project. In
particular, government commitment has been obtained for appropriate levels of technical assistance.
Specific lessons from the Technical Training Project (FY85) include: (a) the need to develop a sector
policy; (b) the need for increased role of private sector in skilled manpower development; and (c) the
need for establishing adequate project implementation arrangements for civil works during project
preparation.
11.   PROJECT PREPARATION. The proposed project has been prepared by the Government in a
participatory manner with the support from a Population and Human Resource Development (PHRD)
Japanese grant, in close cooperation with representatives of relevant government agencies and the private
sector. Working groups from the General Authority for Vocational and Technical Training (GAVTT) and
MOE coordinated the preparation process. Major policy issues were extensively reviewed with the
Ministers of Labor, Education and Planning. In October 1994, the Federal Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, with IDA assistance, arranged a seminar on VT management and financing. The seminar was
chaired by the Prime Minister and brought together government officials and about 200 stakeholders --
vocational educators, private sector representatives, NGOs and donor representatives. It arrived at a
series of policy recommendations that have now been endorsed by both the Government and the private
sector and form the basis for the proposed project. The working groups prepared technical proposals for
each sub-component including equipment lists, technical assistance with detailed terms of reference,
rehabilitation requirements for each center, and monitoring and impact indicators.
12.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES. The proposed project would help strengthen Yemen's capacity to train
skilled manpower in line with present and emerging needs of the economy. This would be achieved
through: (a) strengthening VTS management by providing a major role to the private sector in policy-
making, management and financing of the VT system; (b) improving the quality and relevance of VT
through the enhancement of existing programs and selective expansion of new programs; and (c)
reorienting and improving, through participation of communities, adult education and training programs
for women to enhance their relevance to labor market and community needs.
13.   POLICY FRAMEWORK. Under the proposed project, a new governance structure and financing
mechanism would be established for the VTS with majority representation to the private sector. A
Sector Policy Statement has been issued by the Government, and its key elements include the following:
(a) overall VT policy would become the responsibility of a National Council for Vocational Training
(NCVT); (b) GAVTT would be reorganized to give more autonomy to VTCs; (c) VTCs, with support
from the local private sector, would be given more flexibility to develop training programs responsive to
local and regional labor market demands; and (d) additional resources for both pre-employment and in-
service training would be mobilized through a Skill Development Fund (SDF) financed and managed by
participating employers. VTCs would receive funds from the SDF as well as from tuition fees, income
generating activities and voluntary contributions of employers and local communities. The share of
government support for curriculum development, maintenance of buildings and equipment, instructor
training, instructional material, and for short-term employment of experts from industry would decline
over time. This policy framework would strengthen the long-term viability of the VTS and provide
resources for different types of enterprise-based training, including apprenticeship and cooperative
programs. Strong private sector involvement and commitment of private funds would provide the
necessary conditions to manage the VTS effectively and efficiently.
14.   PROJECT COMPONENTS. The proposed project would achieve the above stated objectives
through the provision of technical assistance (TA), equipment and training materials, rehabilitation of
facilities, and civil works for the following components:
(a)   Institutional Development (US$3.2 m) focussing on: (a) setting up the new governance structure
by strengthening the capacity of GAVTT to facilitate policy-making, set national standards for VT and



4
monitor implementation and compliance in cooperation with the private sector; (b) establishing a Skill
Development Fund (SDF) to broaden the basis for VT financing; and (c) developing implementation
capacity in the GAVTT Project Implementation Unit (PIU).
(b)    Quality Improvement (US$42.3 m) focussing on: (a) strengthening institutional capacity for
curriculum development including trainee assessment and instructional material development;
(b) supporting in-service training of trainers; (c) developing a system of continuing education;
(d) establishing a hi-tech training center; (e) strengthening and rehabilitating 15 existing VTCs offering
programs in industrial and commercial specializations. The hotel and tourism institute in Sana'a would be
strengthened in collaboration with the private sector; (f) strengthening programs for rehabilitating the
physically handicapped through vocational training; and (g) establishing two new pilot VTCs in close
collaboration with the private sector with programs reflecting emerging trends in VT, such as enterprise-
based training and apprenticeship training.
(c)    Community supported Adult Education and Training (AET) programs (US$6.0 m) focussing on
income generating opportunities for females through: (a) institutional development of AET Centers to
design programs based on participatory approaches; (b) establishment of an AET project funding facility
to support programs which meet agreed criteria; and (c) introduction to marketing and credit alternatives
to promote, in an organized manner, production and sale of marketable products of AET centers.
15.   PROJECT FINANCING. The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$59.8 million,
including contingencies. The IDA credit would finance US$24.3 million (41 %) while the government
would provide US$9.5 million (16%). OPEC Fund will contribute US$10 million (17%). Additional
cofinancing covering US$16.0 million (26%) is expected to be forthcoming from the Netherlands, Japan,
and European Union who have expressed interest in the project.
16.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. The VT component would be implemented by GAVTT under
the overall supervision of the Minister of MSSL. A new project implementation unit (PIU) has been
established in GAVTT and core staff have already been appointed. Relevant training prior to credit
effectiveness is being provided to the PIU staff through a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The AET
component would be implemented through the well-established PIU of the MOE. A female AET
coordinator would be appointed by the PIU to manage this component and a technical committee with
representation from all the ministries involved in AET as well as NGOs would be established to review
proposals and monitor their implementation.
17.   AGREEMENTS REACHED. Agreements have been reached with the Government on: (a) the
sector development policy for VT; (b) the revised role and mandate of GAVTT to monitor and implement
policy changes in management of VT; (c) the establishment of the SDF and its operation and management
(the decree establishing the SDF has been issued, operating procedures agreed, and the interim Chairman
for the SDF appointed); (d) tax exemption for contributions to the SDF; (e) retention of income generated
by VT and AET Centers; and (f) IDA financing to be restricted to contracts denominated in foreign
currency (to facilitate financing of local costs at market exchange rate).
18.   ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT. The project is classified as "C".
19.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVE CATEGORIES. The proposed project would contribute to poverty
alleviation through: (a) employment of Yemenis in better paid jobs and by increasing the supply of skilled
labor in line with labor demand; and (b) improving income generating prospects for women by providing
them with appropriate skills.
20.   PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY. Project features that would contribute to sustainability of the
project include: (a) institutional development of GAVTT and more autonomy to VTCs; (b) greater



5
responsibility to private sector for VT and to communities for AET planning and management; (c)
additional resources for VT financing would come from the private sector through the SDF, retention of
income through student fees, and income generating activities of the VTCs and would reduce public
financing of VT; (d) negligible annual increase in the recurrent budget of the government (YR5.4 million
at project completion compared to the total budget of YR7.0 billion in 1994 prices). Additional resources
generated through SDF are estimated at YR150 million out of which about YR130 million would be
targeted to private sector training initiatives; and (e) careful preparation of the project which takes into
account implementation risks for each component.
21.    PROJECT BENEFITS. First, the project would make the VT system more responsive to the
labor market and the needs of present employers to increase productivity. Second, by supporting the
qualitative upgrading of the VT system, the project would facilitate the employment of Yemenis in better
paid jobs and thus increase family incomes and living standards. When fully operational, annual outputs
would include some 6,900 graduates -- 3,200 from VTCs, 1,000 from enterprise based training programs,
2,000 from continuing education programs, 100 from high-tech programs, and 1,000 from programs for
the handicapped. Third, the project would enhance employment and income-generating opportunities for
women by teaching them marketable skills. Finally, in the longer term, these changes would provide a
strong basis for sustainable expansion of VT through private sector initiatives, both for pre-employment
and in-service training, in line with emerging labor demand. Over time, the project would generate
significant economic benefits on a sustained basis, generating an internal rate of return (IRR) of about 16
percent. A sensitivity analysis has shown this estimate to be robust. Additional benefits not quantified in
these calculations would accrue from the training of handicapped persons and from literacy and health
education of women.
22.   PROJECT RISKS. The proposed project entails the following risks: (a) the capacity of MSSL
and the newly established GAVTT might be insufficient to adequately plan and implement a major reform
program for VT in the face of significant administrative and financial constraints. This risk has been
minimized by the institutional development of GAVTT through active involvement of the entire GAVTT
staff in participatory project preparation, and would be further minimized through training of GAVTT
staff prior to credit effectiveness, agreement on specific policy actions, and specific TA including the
German Technical Advisory Team; (b) bureaucratic systems in Yemen may not adjust to establishing a
partnership with employers. This risk would be mitigated through majority representation of employers
in policy-making through NCVT and management of VTCs through LCVTs; (c) the social acceptance of
female students in the northern governorates, who in the past have been excluded from VT. This risk
would be minimized through the involvement of NGOs, women's associations and community leaders in
the preparation and implementation of projects; (d) slow implementation and disbursement. This risk has
been minimized through advance preparation of civil works bidding documents as part of PPF supported
activities prior to credit effectiveness, and early procurement arrangements for TA. In addition, remedial
actions agreed with the government during the May 1995 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR)
are expected to have a positive impact on implementation performance of ongoing projects and for the
proposed project in particular; and (e) the expected cofinancing may not materialize. In that case, the
project would be downsized accordingly by reducing support to fewer than 15 VTCs.
23.   RECOMMENDATION. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
