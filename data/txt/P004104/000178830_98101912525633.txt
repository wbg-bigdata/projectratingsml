FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. THE SECTOR
Background
1.01      Information on the water supply and sewerage sector is varied in
its reliability and adequacy because of the several institutions with
differing degrees of competence that are involved in the sector at the state
and local levels. There is also a general lack of coordination among these
institutions due to the disorganized state of the sector resulting in water
resource management problems. Increased population densities in the
metropolitan areas resulting from rapid economic growth are associated with
some of the more critical environmental problems due to the burdens placed
upon the environmental assimilative capacities of the affected regions by
industrial, municipal, and domestic waste discharges, and by a rapid
increase in vehicular traffic. However, adequate sector information exists,
especially in regard to the urgent need to expand water supplies for
municipal and industrial needs in major cities of the country and the
hazards to health-caused by pollution of the country's water resources, to
provide a justification for the first water supply project, whic.h also makes
a start in correcting the organizational weaknesses.
Water Resources
1.02      The Republic of Korea is situated in the southern part of the
Korean peninsula and occupies a land area of 98.9 thousand sq km. About
two thirds of the land is mountainous and largely unsuitable for culti-
vation. There are ten major river basins in the country which account for
75% of the land area and of these the basins of the four largest rivers, the
Han, Nagdong, Keum and Yongsan comprise 66% of the land area. Rainfall
averages about 1,000 mm per annum mostly occurring between April and
September, when floods are common. The climate is characterized by dry and
cold winters, warm summers and cyclical droughts. Multipurpose dams have
been constructed, or are in the course of construction in four of the river
basins to reduce flooding and also to store water for municipal and
industrial needs, agriculture and power generation.
The Environment
1.03      Korea's industrial development and simultaneous rapid urban-
ization has been responsible for a nottceable decline in the quality of the
environment because of increasing water, soil and air pollution. Several
streams, rivers, estuaries and bays have been grossly polluted from the
discharge of untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial wastes

levels at which most aquatic life wouid not survive - have been measured in
the Han and Nagdong Rivers. Fish kills have beei reported in coastal waters
off Ulsarn, Masan and Jinhae. The ma,or air pollutants are sulphur dioxide,
suspended particulates, carbon monoxlde, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons,
heavy metals and fluorides    The Korean standard for long term exposure to
sulphur dioxide i s based on an averaging time of 24 h ours.  According to
this standard, the daily arithmetic mean shouTld be less than 0.05 ppm for more
than 225 days per year0  This standard was exceeded in Seoul in 1979 by more
than 100% and in Busan by more than 16%.  For comparison the annual average
primary standard in the US is  0.3 
Public Health
1.04       Threats to health exist r..ot only from air pollution but also pollu.-
tion of the water supply in some urban and industrial areas by heavy metals
and carcinogens.  Water borne diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever and
cholera are prevalent. In the summer of i98O there was an increase in the
incidence of cholera in the project ci ties of Gwangiu, Daegu and Masan.
Intestinal parasitic infections are prevale.:nt in farming areas where nightsoli
is commonly used as fertilizer.
Population - Growth and Distribution
1.05       Overall population growth is expected to remain at the 1.9% per
annum recorded during 1970-78.  The population, as oF December 1979, itS
estimated at 37.4 million and projected to rise to 50 million by 2000. Migra-
tion to urban areas, which resulted In an average urban growth rate of 5.2%
during 1970-78, is expected to be less rapid in the 1980s, with the urban
population levelling off at about 80% of thle total population by the end of
the century.
Sector Organization
1.06       There is no single agencl- in charge of overall planning and program-
ming of the water supply, sewerage aed sanrtation sector.  At the central
government level five institutions, TA-tchn are directly involved in the sector
in various ways, ofter overlap with each, other.  These are:  the 'Ministrv of
Construction (MOC) for industrial and..      gon' prcoects and general sactorol.
planning; the Ministry of Home Affairs (Ak) for t-he smalloer cities also mak-
ing sectoral plans; the Miniastry of lea'lth and  Soeial Affairs (MORSA) for
simple rural schemes; the Office of the En-Eivi nment (OOD) charged with deve-
loping control strategies f£r protectisig gir and water quality including nightzt
soil treatment plants and, finall.y. t.he EconomL.c P anning Board  hEPB) for
obtaining external loans.  In additt4ion Lhtere are so-as "special" cities with



- 3 -
varying degrees of autonomy carrying out development works in the sector. For
example, the two largest cities, Seoul and Busan are almost completely
independent and carry out sector development with little or no consultation
with institutions at the provincial or central government level. In the
absence of national priorities, each Ministry or special city prepares its own
plans and implements projects. Tariffs are set by the Government through MHA.
To upgrade the organization of the sector, Government agreed during
negotiations to set up by not later than June 30, 1982 an interministerial
committee in the MOC to study and make recommendations for improving
coordination between the institutions and for the long-term rationalization of
sector. Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that such a
committee would be established under terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank not later than June 30, 1982 and the study would be completed and its
findings discussed with the Bank, before its recommendations are implemented,
in consultation with the Bank by not later than June 30, 1983.
Population Served-Water Supply
1.07      The quality of service of piped water supply is generally poor
because most of the water utilities have not kept pace with the rapid urban-
ization and population growth. The fringe areas of many cities suffer from
restricted supply, water rationing and frequent low pressures. The fluctua-
ting pressures and high leakage - with unaccounted for water of the order of
40% to 50%-- together with the discharge of sewage effluents into street
drains and consequent infiltration makes the quality of the water in the
distribution systems in most cities generally unsafe. Except for the rural
systems, the treated water is chlorinated before distribution. However,
because of poor operational standards the required optimum doses are not
consistently maintained. The proposed project provides for improving
operations in the five cities.
1.08      At the end of 1979, out of the national population estimated at
37.4 million, about 26.7 million (71%) living in both urban and rural areas
were served by piped systems./l In the urban areas 54 communities with
populations of 50,000 and oveTr- including the capital city of Seoul with a
population of 7.8 million - had 85% served with house connections; 81 commun-
ities with populat-ions between 50,000 and 20,000 had 49% served with house
connections; and 97 communities with populations under 20,000 and above
1,000 had 39% served. However, though 79% of the urban population had house
connections the quality of the service was poor. The few public standposts
that exist are metered and charged a subsidized rate. In the rural areas,
out of 32,600 villages, each with more than 20 households with a total popu-
lation of 9.5 million, 72% had simple piped systems, serving 6.9 million.
/1 UN data for 1976: of total population 62% were served with water
supply and 61% were served with excreta disposal facilities.



-4 -
Of this population about 90% were provided with private taps - with most of
the remainder using public standposts and/or shallow wells. Studies to
prepare a future water sLlpply project will be aimed at inicreasing coverage
to those     wsities With service levels below 50%, and raising standards in
ru-ral areas.  The proposed project includes such communities with a mix of
medium sized and large towns in four or more regional studies.
Po ulati on Served - Waste Water Disposal
1.09      Irn a sample of cities with populations over 50,000 only 22% of the
dwellings had flush toilets in 1979; the rest used night soil collection
systems. Except for the two biggest cities - Seoul (7.8 million) and Busan
(2.7 million) which treat a part of their domestic sewage -  most of the
waste water derived from septic tank effluents, domestic use and urban
runoff is discharged, untreated, into the surface waters.  There are also
vault privies with night soi1l collection and treatment facilities in 40
large cities serving a population of 20.8 million.  Ti  1976, 61% of this
population were served with excreta disposal facilities. Night soil is used
as a fertilizer after composting with rice husks in the rural areas.
Currentlv there is a move away from night soil treatment plants to conven-
tional se-werage in some of these cities, where municipal and domestic wastes
pose a serious threat to the water supply.
I. 10     in addition, there are about 16,000 industrial plants in the
couintry generating pollutants that require disposal. Of these about 2,000
discharge industrial waste waters, often toxic in nature, consisting of
organic materials, heavy metals, oils, acids and synthetics into the four
major river basins. In terms of organic loadings it is estimated that 42%
of water pollution is due to municipal sewage and night soil, 45% to
industrial wastes and 13% to agricultural runoff. The OOE is preparing to
study pollution in two of the country's most important basins, the Han and
Nagdong River Basins. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be assisting
with studies of the Han River Basin following which OOE will undertake the
Nagdong River Basin studies,  An understanding was reached during nego-
tiations that the Nagdong studies for which the draft terms of reference
have been reviewed by the Bank and are satisfactory, will be completed by
December 31, 1986 which is in time to accommodate detailed design for the
next stage expansion of the Daegu and Masan water supply which draw from the
Nagdong River.
Past Tnvestments in the Sector
lii       Data onL sector investments have been analyzed as best as possible
since none of the agencies referred to in para. 1.06 produce complete sector
stat7isticS or even com-arable data covering the same subsector.  In the
Go-vet-nment s Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) W 181.9 billion was allocated
for         wavbli  works in the sector and W 62.9 billion (1975 prices) for health
and eDirironment.  Actual expenditure up to the end of 1980 was about 66% of
pl -r targets and by the end of the plan period inivestment is estimated to



-5-
reach only 75% of planned amounts. For regional water supplies and
metropolitan sewerage, about W 30 billion and W 29.0 billion respectively
were provided in the Plan but no major investment had been made up to end
1980. Out of the 9 provinces in the country and the two special cities of
Seoul and Busan, per capita investment ranged from W 4,749 in Seoul and
W 3,334 in Busan to W 648 in Chungcheong Nam province. With the exception
of Daegu, there has been no major investment under the Plan in the five
cities included in the proposed project.
The Fifth Five-Year Plan
1.12      The Government's policies for the sector in the next Plan (1982-86)
include preservation of water quality, replacing obsolete equipment and
pipelines and investments for sewerage together with the institution of
policies for cost recovery of sewerage services. As an example of the
sectoral organization problems discussed earlier, both MOC and MRA have
produced different programs for sectoral investments in the Fifth Plan. MOC
has approached the task by setting targets (for 1986: population served 80%,
demand 300 lcd, system losses 38%, etc.) to provide a basis for arriving at
the investments required for city water supplies and for regional schemes,
which aggregate to W 1,092 billion. MRA has come up with an investment plan
of W 1,390.8 billion, about 20% higher than MOC's estimate. The basis of
MIHAs estimate is not known. The approved investment program is W 486.0 bil-
lion (1980 prices) which is approximately two- and one-half times as much as
the Fourth Plan budget.
1.13      MOC has long term goals for sewerage service levels in about 36
cities: it aims at providing service to 25%, 30% and 50% of the population of
those cities by 1986, 1991 and 1996 respectively. In general, it is planned
to provide sewage treatment facilities by 1986 to cities (including industrial
areas) with populations of over 0.3 million and to other smaller cities by
1990. The proposed plan is ambitious, and it does not provide for investment
in separate sanitary sewage collection systems without which sewer service
cannot be provided and costs recovered. Work has, however, started in three
cities, partly with ADB funding, for the construction of sewage treatment
plants.
1.14      No investments for environmental pollution abatement are envisaged
in the Plan, except for the studies of the Nagdong River and Han River Basins.
It is expected that by about 1984 and 1986 these studies would have identified
projects which will require priority investments.
Manpower
1.15      There is a lack of basic information on availability of manpower
in the sector and on training needs.  A survey will be made by the
Government in the context of national planning by MOC and OOE to identify
manpower resources (water supply, waste water treatment and environmental
protection) their utilization, future needs, competing demands and the



-6 -
factors which give rise to attrition. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the survey would be conducted under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank and completed by December 31, 1982, and following
discussion with the Bank provide a basis for the training programs in the
proposed project, in accordance with an implementation schedule acceptable
to the Bank.
Bank Lending in the Sector
1.16      The Bank's Kyongju Tourism Project (Loan 953-KG) and the Second
Regional Development Project (Loan 1758-KO) included water supply components
for Kyongju, Mogpo and Yeosu Cities. The Bank's Rural Infrastructure
projects Loan 1216/18-KO and Loan 1530-KO included about 11,400 simple rural
piped water systems. No evaluation of these projects has yet been prepared.
The Bank's strategy in the sector is to help government develop a least cost
investment program for improving water supply, sewerage sanitation and
environmental pollution abatement facilities and to provide technical
assistance and training for institution building and staff development. The
Government is preparing a second water supply and sanitation project for
1984. Water supply and sanitation investments will also be included in the
Regional Development Project proposed for Korea's Jeonju Region.
2. THE BORROWER, EXECUTING AGENCIES AND BENEFICIARIES
The Borrower
2.01      A Bank loan of $90.0 million is proposed.  The Borrower will be
the Government of the Republic of Korea which will relend $86.5 million on
the same terms as the Bank loan, plus a service charge of 0.05% per annum,
to the five municipalities of Gwangju, Daegu, Masan, Changwon and Jinhae to
finance their respective water supply subprojects. The execution of a
subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank, with each city, will be a
condition of disbursement of the Bank loan for expenditures on the project
(see para. 4.07). -The Government will allocate the balance of the loan to
the Ministry of Construction ($3.5 million) for project preparation studies,
manpower development and staff training.
Executing Agencies
2.02      The coordinating agency for the water supply subprojects will be the
Water Resources Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, which will also be
responsible for preparing future water supply projects. The Bureau is being
strengthened to make it more effective in performing such functions as
project preparation; monitoring performance of project construction; loan
administration and ensuring that the various subprojects are completed by



- 7 -
the five cities as scheduled. The Water Supply Division of the Bureau has
already gained some experience in the preparation and implementation of
water supply projects financed by the ADB, and no special problems are
anticipated. Nevertheless MOC requires additional training in preparing
projects using appropriate techniques for achieving a least cost solution.
The proposed project will provide on-the-job training in these areas. The
Water Resources Bureau's organization structure /1 relative to its functions
in water supply and sewerage is shown in Chart 22312. The adequate
strengthening /2 of the Bureau would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan (see para. 4.12).
2.03      The Office of the Environment (OOE) will be responsible for the
environmental management study of the Nagdong River Basin and for the
preparation of environmental projects. OOE was established under the
Ministry of Health and Social Affairs on December 29, 1979 and charged with
the execution of the Environmental Preservation Law of December 31, 1977.
This legislation is satisfactory and OOE, in its brief existence of one year,
has made adequate institutional arrangements to enable it to undertake the
Nagdong River Basin studies.
Beneficiaries
2.04      The main beneficiaries of the proposed project will be the five
cities of Gwangju, Daegu, Masan, Changwon and Jinhae. These cities, which
were selected by Government for rapid industrial development, are growing at
a fast pace (total projected population of 3.9 million by 1985) and are
currently experiencing water shortages, of which the most serious are in
Gwangju and Masan. Master plans and feasibility studies have been prepared
for water supply expansion and it is projected by the consultants that by
1985, almost 90% of the population of these cities, of which 5 - 10% would be
urban poor, would be served with water.
Organization and Management
2.05      The Water Supply Bureaus of Gwangju and Daegu will be responsible
for project construction in these two cities. Because of the special
nature of the regional municipal bulk water supply scheme, Masan's Water
Supply Bureau will construct the major facilities for the three cities of
Masan, Changwon and Jinhae. The Mayor of Masan is organizing a special
Project Office in the Masan Water Supply Bureau for this purpose. The three
cities are about to enter into a Regional Management Agreement by which
Masan would appoint consultants, award contracts, supervise construction and
/1 Based upon latest information
/2 The selection of one water supply engineer and two financial
analysts is considered the minimum required.



-8-
operate the bulk municipal water supply facilities (see para. 4.13). The
installation of house connections, production metering, local distribution
improvements, upgrading works, including improved plumbing practices and
leakage surveys would be the responsibility of the individual cities.
2.06      In order to maximize the economic utilization of water resources
the Government has ensured that all capital works in the sector require
clearance by MOC. Future water supply investments in Masan Region, both in
the proposed municipal water supply schemes and the existing industrial
water supply system would be made only after careful technical and economic
reviews by MOC./I   This will have the benefits of lower costs for both
industrial and municipal categories. Assurances were also obtained during
negotiations that all major investments for municipal and industrial water
supplies in the Masan Region would only be implemented with the Bank's prior
approval on the basis of technical and economic reviews by MOC.
2.07      Four of the five cities suffer from frequent staff changes and a
general lack of experience in dealing with problems in the sector. Daegu is
the exception with highly motivated and competent management and staff. The
proposed project will therefore include a component to provide engineering
and financial consultants as well as staff training to assist the four
cities.  In the case of Gwangju City there is, in addition, a special
provision for management services for the design and supervision of
construction of a 43 m high rockfill dam (see Annex 1), since this city has
little experience in the construction of large projects.
2.08      Gwangju, Daegu and Masan have Water Supply Bureaus responsible for
the water supply operation. Chart 22313 sh3ws a typical organization of
these Bureaus. Each Bureau is headed by a Director who reports directly to
the Mayor and enjoys limited autonomy. The Business Section is responsible
for accounting, finance and commercial activities and the Construction
Section is responsible for planning and implementing its expansion programs.
This organizational structure is considered adequate.
2.09      Jinhae has a Water Supply Section and Changwon a Water Supply
Subsection of the Urban Planning Section. Both municipalities are
planning to convert the Sections to Bureaus when the volume of operations
justify the upgrading. The best operated Bureau is the one in Daegu mainly
because its Director has remained in that position for nearly seven years.
He has implemented projects financed by AID and ADB. The Masan Bureau will
be entrusted with the implementation of the projects for Masan, Changwon and
Jinhae.
/1 The industrial bulk water supply scheme, known as the Majin System is
owned by OC and operated by the Industrial Sites and Water Resources
Corporation (ISWACO) and serves industrial complexes in Masan region.



-9-
Accounting and Auditing
2.10      Water supply accounts are kept separate from the other activities
of the municipality and funds generated are not transferred to other
municipal activities. The Masan, Gwangju and Daegu water supply bureaus
follow an accounting system designed by the Ministry of Home Affaiirs while
the water supply sections of Changwon and Jinhae use municipal accounting
guidelines provided by the provincial government. Neither accounting system
is on a fully accrual basis: both are geared mainly to budgetary purposes.
Accordingly financial reports are of limited use as management tools.
Financial reports are prepared annually and the records kept up to date.
Accounts for Masan, Daegu, Gwangju and Changwon are audited by independent
private auditors and audit of Jinhae-s accounts is conducted by the
provincial government. The audited financial reports for 1980 have been
reviewed and are of varying quality with many shortcomings. Financial
planning is limited to budgets prepared annually for the following year and
reviewed periodically.
2.11      During negotiations the five cities agreed:  (a) to hire consul-
tants under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank to assist the
municipalities introduce (i) required adjustments to convert the accounting
system of their water supply operations to an accrual-based, commercial
accounting system, (ii) financial planning, management and internal control
systems which would provide for the compilation and control of statements of
expenditure and are essential for the successful implementation of future
expansion programs. Both accounting and financial systems should be in
operation by December 31, 1983; (b) unless the Bank otherwise agrees, not to
transfer the funds generated by the water supply operations to other
municipal activities; and (c) to have their accounts audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and to furnish to the Bank the annual
audited financial statements and the auditors report to management within
six months of the close of each year.
Billings and Collections
2.12      The five water supply systems are almost fully metered.  Meters are
read and bills prepared monthly. Except for Daegu which recently started to
process bills by computer, all the water bureaus do the billing manually.
Daegu's experience is being followed by the other cities to decide if they
should also computerize billings in the future.
2.13      Collections are made through commercial banks and branch offices.
Collection procedures are tight and are strictly enforced. Although the
accounting systems make it difficult to determine accurately the level of
accounts receivable outstanding, they are estimated to be equivalent to about
30 days of billings.

3. WATER DEMAND
General
3.01      Per capita water consumption in the two largest project cities of
Daegu and Gwangju will be about the same, although Gwangju has a low
consumption at present because of inadequate production facilities. Masan's
consumption will reach the level of Changwon when the new Masan Satellite
Industrial Town comes on line in about 1986. Jinhae's consumption is
projected to be a little less than all of the others because there are no
immediate plans for new industry; it serves as a dormitory town for
neighboring Changwon and is a recreation center for the Masan region. In
projecting demand, it is assumed that the economy will overcome the present
recession and industrial growth will continue as planned in the project
cities. The existing situation of the water systems is described in Annex 2c
3.02      Service Areas.  The water supply service areas cover the munici-
palities of Gwangju and Daegu and the contiguous municipalities of Masan,
Changwon and Jinhae; these latter three cities are referred to as the MlAsan
Region. Changwon is a planned new city designed with the express purpose of
encouraging industry. With the exception of a few residential suburbs in
Daegu, the water supply development program to the year 2000 will take place
mostly within the boundaries illustrated in Maps IBRD 15432 to 15434.
3.03      Population.  The population projections for the service areas were
based upon demographic variables of population by age and gender, death and
fertility rates and migration, derived from historical population data.
An important factor affecting growth is recent government policy to
restrict the expansion of Seoul and Busan and divert industry to the five
provincial cities of Gwangju, Daegu, Masan, Daejon and Chongju. This means
more new manufacturing industries than anticipated in three of the project
cities with corresponding changes in urban planning; some of these changes
have already been made, for example, Masan has made firm plans to build a
satellite town to accommodate this policy. The corresponding growth rates
are therefore high in the initial years of the project.
3.04      On the basis of these assumptions, upper and lower population
growth curves were derived and curves near the median selected for design
of the water supply systems. For Daegu the selected curve assumes an annual
growth of 4.5% from 1978 to 1988; during that period its population is
projected to increase from 1.49 to 2.31 million, Gwangju, in the same
period would grow at 4.6% per annum with a population increase from 0.69 to
1.09 million.  Because of the Changwon Industrial Complex, situated betw een
Masan and Jinhae, the Masan Region is expected to achieve a very high rate
of growth of 7% per annum until 1985 when the complex would be completed.
Even after 1985, growth is expected to be a high 5% per annum until l990,
because of Masan Satellite Town.  During the 1978-1988 period Masan wouLd
have grown from 0.39 to 0.60 million, Masan Satellite gained 0.19 million,
Changwon grown from 0.07 to 0.29 million and Jinhae from 0.11 to 0.14
million. Should population increase follow the lower growth assumption thie
water supply systems would reach maximum capacities between 1986 and iQ92.



- 11 -
Population Served
3.05      Population served with water in 1979 ranges from a high 92% in
Daegu to 69% in Masan. Changwon was just being built and no statistics are
available. The first stage of the project would improve the quality and
level of service and in the face of high population growth would slightly
improve coverage. At the end of 1985 population served will increase to 94%
in Daegu, 86% in Gwangju, 77% in Masan, 76% in Jinhae and 83% in Changwon
(see para. 3.10). These are reasonable targets since by the end of the
decade Daegu would achieve 96% service coverage and the others about 90%.
Without the project, the quality of service would rapidly deteriorate
because of the rapid populatiion growth, and the possible recurrence of
cholera would pose a threat to public health. The projected growth of
industry in these cities would also be adversely affected.
3.06      Water Use.  Field surveys were made in Daegu and Gwangju in 1979
to determine water use characteristics. The Gwangju survey based upon
actual measurements of metered consumption, showed water consumption to be
about 134 liters per capita per day (lcd) in middle income residential
areas and 200 lcd in upper income residential areas. The Daegu surveys were
based upon interviews supplemented by metered consumption data. Although
there was no evidence of absolute poverty, some relative poverty was identi-
fied in the poorest sections of Daegu wherever this was possible, since
generally small pockets of poor coexist with upper and middle level
residences. According to the Daegu surveys, annual incomes in poor house-
holds were estimated to range from $1,180 to $4,800 with the number of
persons per household ranging from 2 to 9 with an average per capita income
of $493.90./l The average per capita income of the middle income group was
$1,177.  Water use by the relative poor in Daegu averaged 77 lcd, the middle
income residential 117 lcd and the upper income residential 175 lcd, a
little lower than the findings in Gwangju. (See para. 6.06).
3.07      A limited leakage survey was carried out by the consultants in
Gwangju. Though leaks at service connections were noted, no major losses
from pipelines were detected. Meters were also found to over-register. In
Jinhae, where most of the service connections are of plastic materials
unaccounted for water was the lowest at 28%. Daegu, Gwangju and Masan with
unaccounted for water at levels of 36%, 40% and 45%, respectively are pre-
paring programs to reduce the level to 25% by 1985. It was agreed during
negotiations that these programs which are to be implemented throughout the
project period, would be sent to the Bank for review by June 30, 1982.
/1 This is higher than the average estimate for urban absolute poverty
for the country of $320 for 1978. Daegu is a comparatively wealthy
city and the higher per capita income is to be expected.



- 12 -
3.08      There are some 70 public taps (owned by the city and providing
water to groups of more than 20 households) in Gwangju and 200 in Daegu.
Daegu also has 138 common use taps (privately owned and providing water to
groups ranging from 6 to 20 households). The numbers of these taps
have been steadily declining and are expected to be phased out by 1990.
Water from public and private taps is charged at a subsidized rate.
Water Production Estimates.
3.09      The projected water demand in each of the five cities was based upon
(a) a study of the historical water consumption by different categories of
users such as domestic, commercial, industrial and public use; (b) planned
future growth in each user category; and (c) expected improved efficiency in
operations with reduction in unaccounted for water.  By 1985, on average,
half the water consumption is expected to be for residental use, one quarter
for commercial use, about 10% for industrial use and the remainder for other
uses.
3e10      Between 1981 and 1983 water production estimates are indicative
of the maximum system capacities and interim augmentation works undertaken
in Daegu, Gwangju and Changwon. Water from the proposed project will enter
the system in 1985 for Gwangju and in late 1984 for the other cities.
Water production estimates and population projections for 1981 and 1985 are
given below:

4. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
4.01      The main objectives of the project are to improve access to safe
water supplies to the populations in the five project cities, develop a
strategy for improving the institutional organizanization of the sector and
prepare priority water supply projects for the future.
Project Concept and Composition
4.02      Water supply improvements in most cities in Korea are often made
in an ad hoc manner with minimum planning, inadequate preparation and
financing, often leading to costly delays.  In the case of this project,
however, the concept and composition are unique because, in accordance with
the Bank's advice, this is the first time that long-term master plans for
water supplies have been prepared and feasibility studies made to select
projects identified as being the least cost solution for staged implementa-
tion. With the institutional improvements proposed in the project it is
expected that this approach would be adopted routinely in similar projects
in the future.
4.03      The project was prepared in about 18 months by the Water Supply
Bureaus of Gwangju, Daegu and Masan, and Water Supply Sections of Changwon
and Jinhae with the assistance of consultants and was appraised in
September/October 1980. The consultants for Daegu, Masan, Changwon and
Jinhae were Stanley Associates Engineering Ltd (Canada) in a joint venture
with Korean Engineering Consultants Corporation (SAEL/KECC). The consult-
ants for Gwangju were initially Chas T. Main (USA) in a joint venture
with Korean Engineering Consultants, Ltd. (CTM/KECL). These studies were
subsequently reviewed and completed by SAEL/KECC with assistance from
CTM/KECL. SAEL/KECC consultants are also preparing the detailed designs
which are now substantially advanced and would be in sufficient detail for
tendering purposes by the time of board presentation in December 1981. The
local consultants KECC and KECL have gained valuable experience in the
preparation of the studies. Because of difficulties experienced by the cities
in obtaining foreign exchange to finance the foreign costs of the consulting
services retroactive financing of $1.0 million equivalent, representing
expenditures incurred after project appraisal is recommended.
Project Description
4.04      Detailed project descriptions for each city, which would be
incorporated in the subsidiary loan agreements, are presented in Annex 3. The
main features of the project are described below:
Part A - Municipal Water Supply Systems
(a) Source development including the construction of two river
intakes, pumping stations for Daegu and Masan and the
construction of a rockfill dam and pumping station for Gwangju;



- 15 -
(b) the construction of raw and treated water transmission systems
including booster stations;
(c) the construction and upgrading of water treatment facilities;
(d) the construction and upgrading of water distribution systems
including reservoirs, booster stations, pipelines, service
connections and metering;
(e) leakage control;
(f) consultant services for engineering and construction supervision;
and
(g) training.
Part B - Technical Assistance
This component will assist in the preparation of future water
supply projects as listed below:
(a) consultant services for preparing water supply projects; and
(b) consultant services for manpower surveys and training.
Project Cost and Financing
4.05      Cost Estimates.  The cost estimates made from the feasibility
studies completed in September 1980 have since been revised on the basis of
detailed surveys, field investigations and geologic studies for dam foun-
dations, river intakes and treatment plant sites. For example, because of the
detailed field survey a proposed 6.0 km of tunnel has been reduced to 1.8 km
in Gwangju. This is further reflected in reduced physical contingencies for
major civil works. 'The cost estimates are reasonable and project implementa-
tion can start shortly after loan approval. The summary project estimates
are given below in Table 4.1. The detailed cost estimates are given in
Annex 4 and the facilities to be constructed are illustrated in Maps IBpD
15432 to 15434. The foreign costs represent approximately 37% of the total
construction cost. It is expected that Korean contractors will win all of
the civil works contracts. A forecast of detailed design completion and
bid dates is given below in Table 4.2.
4.06      Contingencies.  The project cost estimates are calculated at a
base line of September 1981 to which were added physical contingencies on
local components of 25% for river intakes, 15% for Dongbok dam and other
major civil works on source development except land and service connections

in Gwangju at 5%; 10% was added to all other categories. The project is to
be constructed over a period of four years. Price contingencies were
calculated at 14% for 1982 and 11% thereafter for the local component and
8.5% for 1982 and 7.5% for 1983 to 1985 on the foreign component.
4.07      Financing.  The project cost, before interest during construction,
is estimated to be $240.5 million including a foreign exchange component
of $90.0 million. A financing plan for the project is given in Table 4.3.
The proposed Bank loan will cover the foreign exchange component and
represent 22% of the total financing requirements. The foreign exchange
component of Part A is $86.5 million and represents 37% of the total cost of
municipal water supplies. Government policy is to finance, through local
loans, up to 50% of the local cost of each subproject; the municipalities
financing the balance from city bonds and water tariff revenues. The
Government would relend to the five municipalities $86.5 million of the
proceeds of the loan under subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the
Bank (see paras. 2.01 and 5.05). The foreign exchange risks will be borne
by the individual municipalities. The loan amounts to the five cities are
given below. There would be a provision in the Bank loan for reassignment
as may be needed in the future.

Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      Civil Works.  All of the major facilities in the construction
program are suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB) and will be
procured according to Bank Group's guidelines. Minor works, such as local
improvements estimated at $7.7 million will be constructed at different
times and in many scattered areas in the five municipalities and would not
interest international bidders. The replacement and upgrading works and
extensions to the distribution system at Jinhae, estimated at $2.2 million
are also unlikely to interest international bidders because of their
relatively small size, the nature of water treatment plant upgrading works
and the remoteness of Jinhae. The total value of these minor civil works is
about $10.0 million (foreign exchange component of about 45%) and represents
about 4% of the project cost. These works would be advertised locally and

interested foreign bidders would have opportunities to participate.  In
respect of the leakage reduction program and service connections totalling
about $9.5 million the municipalities would use their regular staff and/or
local plumbing contractors. The cities would submit to the Bank statements of
expenditure, covering these works, according to procedures acceptable to the
Bank. Supporting documents will be retained by each city with copies in MOC
and made available to Bank missions if required. The statements of
expenditure will be audited according to procedures acceptable to the Bank.
4.10      Specialized Equipment.  Leakage control equipment estimated at
about $1.0 million would be procured through limited international
tendering. This equipment is highly specialized with a limited number of
suppliers and deliveries are required to be carefully coordinated with staff
training, which would be difficult to achieve through normal ICB.
4.11      Disbursement.  Disbursements for civil works would be 40% of the
expenditures. For equipment and materials, disbursements would be 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of directly imported equipment, 100% of the
ex-factory price of locally manufactured equipment; and 65% of goods
procured locally (off the shelf items), with a ceiling of $500,000 for such
purchases. For costs of consultants and training, disbursements would be
100% of expenditures. The estimated schedule of disbursements is presented
in Annex 5.. Because these are heavy infrastructure type of works and since
detailed design will be substantially completed by the time of loan approval
the disbursement profile is an improvement on the country wide disbursement
profile for Korea. The closing date for the proposed Bank loan is June 30,
1986.
Project Implementation
4.12      MOC.  MOC's Water Resources Bureau will employ consultants to carry
out master plans and feasibility studies, detailed designs and tendering
services for the preparation of future water supply projects in both urban and
rural areas, carry out a manpower survey and train staff in the sector. The
tentative list of areas that will benefit include a regional water supply
system based on the dam at Daechong, Samjin Basin, Nam River Basin, Daechun
region and extensions to cities on the outskirts of the Seoul Metropolitan
area. MOC would consult with other concerned ministries such as MRA and MOXSA
in deciding upon priorities. MOC would also coordinate implementation of the
project (see para. 2.02).
4.13      Masan Region.  The director of the Masan City Water Bureau will head
a Project Office to be established in the Bureau to build the municipal bulk
water supply system serving Masan, Changwon and Jinhae. The Project Office is
expected to be created by February 1, 1982 and the terms of the agreement
between the three municipalities of Masan, Changwon and Jinhae should be
acceptable to MOC, EPB and the Bank (see para. 2.05). The execution of the
agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. The
satisfactory staffing of the Project Office would be a condition of
disbursement of the portion of the loan to the Masan Region.

procedures for the maintenance of the dam, acceptable to the Bank.  The dam
and appurtenant works including tunnels will be designed by a Canadian
consuilting f rm t'Shawinigan) in a joirnt venture arrangement with SAEL/KECC
the consultants w-ho prepared the feasibility studies.  Gwangju would also
appoint a Special Board of Consultants (SBC) comprising an engineering
geolOgist an expert on dam design and a dam and ttune±, construction
speacialist to advise upon any special technical problems concerning the
safety of the dam encountered in the desigi and construct-ion of the project0
A hydrologist and otner specialists would be employed for short periods, as
required by the Bank.  It was agreed during negotiations that as a condition
of disbursement Gwangju wovld have appointed ISWACO and SBC. The qualifi-
cations of the members and terms of reference of the SBC should be
aceeptatbe to the BWnka.

or detaled des.igns and super is4bn of construction for the five cities are
based upoa 5X of the base line construction costs; this is reasonable.
Though there are local Korea consulting companies it is not anticipated that
they would play the lead role and for the Durpose of the cost estimates it
is assumaed that internationally recruited consultants would be employed in
joint ventura arrangements with local consultants.  The MOC studies for
future water supplvy proiects are expected to have foreign inputs in areas
where local consultants ha-ve to acquire adequate expertise.  The average
man-mor.t!h cost for Internationally recruited consultants including housing,
transportation and local costs in 1981 is expected to vary between $9,000
and $11,000 depending on qualifications, experience and country of origin.

firms or by direct hire of foreign experts in areas which require strength-
ening, develop sufficient capability to be able to carry out future
engineering with minimum assistance from foreign consultants. This approach
has been sufficient'ly demonstrated in the preparation of the feasibility
studies (see para. 4.02).
4.17      For Masan Region, Daegu and Gwangju, internationally recruited
consultant man-months are estimated to be 106, 109 and 154 respectively;
local counterpart man-months will be approximately double.
4.18      Based upon the experience with the preparation of this first
project MOC, with the available financing, would be in a position to prepare
about 10 major projects in water supply to the stage of completing tender
documents and bid evaluation which would require about 25 internationally
recruited man-months representing 10% of the total estimated consulting time.
4.19      It was agreed during negotiations that the five cities and MOC
would employ consultants for detailed design and supervision of construction
whose experience, qualifications and terms of reference will be acceptable to
the Bank. The five cities also gave assurances during negotiations that all
land acquisition for the project, which has already commenced, would be
completed by June 30, 1983 except for Gwangju where it would be completed
by June 30, 1984. The project is expected to be completed by December 31,
1985.
5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past and Present Financial Performance
5.01      Water supply expansion programs in Masan, Gwangju and Jinhae have
been carried out in a piece-meal fashion and have not required the mobiliza-
tion of large financial resources. Daegu has however satisfactorily
undertaken large projects financed by USAID and ADB. Changwon is a new
inidustrial town inadequately serviced by MOC's Majin system with very little
investment in water supply systems of its own. It has been Government
policy not to make any grants for development of water supply systems to
large and medium-sized cities. Consequently, expansion is normally financed
from internally generated funds, bonds issued by the municipalities, city
funds, MOC approved government loans and rarely, foreign borrowing.
5.022     The following table prepared on the basis of projected financial
statements summarizes the estimated financial highlights of the five water
bureaus at the end of 1980.

/a Excluding depreciation.
5.03      These highlights show that Gwangju, Changwon and Jinhae present a
satisfactory financial position. Daegu has a negative rate of return in 1980
when depreciation on adjusted revalued fixed assets is charged; nevertheless,
the bureau of this city will generate enough income before depreciation to
maintain a healthy debt service coverage. In addition, it will have non-
operating revenues mainly from connection fees - which will improve its
liquidity position. Masan's position is not satisfactory in 1980 due to lower
revenues and higher expenditures than those anticipated at the time of
appraisal. However the municipality has recognized this position by imposing
the largest average tariff increase of all the cities in 1981 and the finan-
cial situation is expected to show progressive improvement.
Tariffs
5.04      Tariffs are customarily reviewed every one or two years, municipa-
lities presenting their requests for tariff increase to the MHA through the
provincial government. The tariff structures are progressive, penalizing
wasteful use of water. The five cities made tariff increases in April 1981 so
that the average tariff in 1981 will increase over 1980 by the following per-
centages Gwangju 21%, Daegu 21%, Masan 62%, Changwon 61%, Jinhae 34% and are
undertaking a further tariff review with a view to implementation not later
than March 1, 1982. Implementation of the tariff increases proposed for 1982
was discussed during negotiations. The cities would use their best efforts to
implement these increases by the due date.
Financing Plan
5.05      Table 5.1 summarizes the financing plans for each one of the five
water bureaus in the project. The proposed financing plan is satisfactory and

it assumes that; (a) tariffs were increased by up to 60% in April 1981 (see
Annex 7) with further increases in subsequent years; (b) that the Bank loan
will be onlent to the municipalities to finance the foreign components of
their projects on the same terms as the Bank loan to the Government plus a
service charge of 0.05% per annum; (c) that according to Government decision
70% of the local component for Gwangju and 50% /1 for other cities will be
financed from government loans at 13% interest p.a. and 20 years repayment
period including 5 years grace period; (d) that city bonds will carry 8%

years. Changwon is planning to use municipal funds instead of bonds to help
finance its project. Assurances by the cities with respect to these financial
arrangements were obtained at negotiations.
5.06      The terms assumed for Government loans and city bonds are those
presently used in Korea to finance this kind of investment. City bonds are
bought by contractors and other users of municipal services. Agreement
was reached during negotiations that the Government would make the loans
required by the cities for the project.
Future Financial Performance
5.07      Financial projections for each one of the five cities are
presented in Annex 6 and the underlying assumptions in Annex 7. Projections
were prepared with the objective of attaining a long-term sound financial
position for each water bureau, based on a sustainable balance between
equity and debt, minimizing financial cost to the cities. During the
project construction period estimated revenues from water sales are those
required to cover the resultant financing gap after the loans from IBRD,
Government, city bonds and, in the case of Changwon the municipal equity
contributions. Although the resultant average tariffs reflect substantial
increases in the early years, they are considered realistic given their
present low level, the users capacity to pay and the municipal and central
government-s willingness to bring their water rates to levels more in line
with the financial needs of the systems.
5.08      It was estimated that after project completion, the tariffs would
cover operation and maintenance, depreciation or debt service, whichever is
higher and contribute to future expansion requirements. Additionally, a
target was set to maintain the debt service coverage ratio above 1.3. This
ratio is adequate for these projects since the debt service will be high in
the 3 or 4 years following project completion due to the repayment of city
bonds but will then drop considerably. For this reason a higher ratio would
require unnecessarily high tariffs. Appropriate covenants have been incor-
porated in the legal documents of the proposed loan to ensure that the cities
achieve the above objectives and maintain the financial soundness of the water
systems (see paras. 5.10, 5.11 and 5.14).
5.09      Table 5.2 presents a summary of the project financial position of
the five cities during the period 1982-88. Based on the underlying assump-
tions their performance is expected to be satisfactory.

Revaluation of Assets
5.10       By law the Water Supply Bureaus are required to revalue their
fixed assets every five years. These revaluations are incorporated in the
Bureaus' accounts. The proposed revenue covenants (para. 5.14) would
require that the Bureaus' fixed assets should be revalued every year using
the GNP deflator published by the EPB or other index acceptable to the Bank.



- 26 -
Debt Control
5.11      To help protect the financial position of the Water Supply Bureaus
of the five cities, agreement was reached during negotiations that the cities
on behalf of their Water Supply Bureaus (Gwangju, Daegu and Masan) and the
Water Supply Sections (Changwon and Jinhae) will not, without the Bank's
approval, incur any long-term debt in any year, unless a reasonable forecast
of the net revenues for each year, during the term of the debt to be incurred,
is not less than 1.3 times its projected debt service requirements for each
such year, on all such debt including the debt to be incurred.
Duties and Taxes
5.12      The Water Supply Bureaus (and Sections) do not pay income taxes but
they pay custom duties ranging from 10% to 15%.
Insurance
5.13      The cities in the project carry limited insurance or no insurance at
all as in Gwangju. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the
municipalities should have their Water Supply Bureaus covered against the
normal risks related to their operations.
Revenue Covenants
5.14      Agreement was obtained during negotiations that the five cities will
undertake on behalf of their Water Supply Bureaus and Water Supply Sections an
immediate review of their financial position to establish the level of tariffs
to meet their cash flow requirements in 1982 and implement such findings by
March 1, 1982 and thereafter take the following actions:
(a)  each year, starting in 1982, review their financial position
and update their financial projections for the following five
years;
(b)  as a result of said review, they will establish the level of
tariffs needed to meet their cash flow requirements for the
following year and to achieve (i) self-financing ratios during
the period 1982-85 of at least 20%; and (ii) after 1985 obtain
the following rates of return on revalued fixed assets in
operation: 7% for Changwon, 8% for Daegu, Masan and Jinhae and
10% for Gwangju;
(c)  furnish such reviews to the Bank for its comments not later
than October 1 of the year preceding the projection period; and
(d)  taking into account the comments of the Bank, implement the
findings of such review by March 1 of the following year.

Monitoring Indicators and Reports
5.15      Monitoring indicators for each city are presented in Annex 6.
During negotiations these indicators were discussed with the five cities and
MOC. The content and frequency of the reports required to monitor their
operations and the implementations of their respective projects were also
discussed.
6. JUSTIFICATION
General
6.01      Because of the rapid urbanization, municipal water supplies in Korea
are becoming more scarce and expensive to develop. These problems, however,
cannot be successfully tackled without some institutional reforms. The pro-
posed project, while meeting the urgent water supply needs of the five cities,
and raising living standards of the low income population would support the
Government's efforts to make a start on reorganizing the sector and also to
prepare future high priority water supply projects. The project would put
special emphasis on the application of sound financial and management policies
in the five cities and also increase the efficiency of the allocation and use
of water resources in the country, beginning with the Masan Region.
Least Cost Solution
6.02      Planning and design criteria suited to local conditions were selec-
ted for developing alternative solutions for major project components such as
the siting of river intakes and transmission systems for Masan and Daegu and
for the selection of the dam site and raw water transmission system for
Gwangju. Cost curves were developed based upon local information, MOC s
standard cost tables and experience elsewhere. For some major components such
as the Dongbok dam the curves were checked against recent bids received by MOC
for similar works. Economic lives were assigned to pumping stations (30
years), pipelines (50 years) and dams (100 years). As a first step technical-
ly feasible alternatives were developed and compared using discount rates of
10% and 12%. Of these the best three were subjected to rigorous financial and
economic analysis to determine affordability and tariff structures.
6.03      The economic analyses for Daegu and Masan to select the least cost
solution, were straight forward because the source selection variables were
limited to two locations, in each case, for river-intakes and treatment plant
sites. The analysis for Gwangju, however, was complicated by staging needed
to supply long-term needs (year 2010) from two dam sites - Dongbok and Juam
to a new treatment plant site near Gwangju at Seongdong. Eleven alternatives



- 28 -
were identified, of which six were selected for present worth analysis at a
discount rate of 12% of both capital and operating costs. (See Chart 22347).
All but one of the discounted costs were close to each other and of these the
alternative judged to be most practical and having least construction risks
under the present circumstances was selected for the project.
6.04      Three types of dams, zoned earthfilled, earthfilled dam with rock
shell and rockfill dam with concrete face, have been identified as being suit-
able for the Dongbok site. Rockfill material is readily available at the
site; sandy silty clay which will require some mixing with coarser material to
increase the strength characteristics of the clay sufficiently to make it
acceptable as an impervious core material, is available about 12 km from the
site; and sand suitable for filter material (or concrete aggregate) is avail-
able 23 km from the site. The preliminary engineering estimates were based on
a rockfill dam with concrete or asphalt face as being the least cost dam type.
A final study on the type of dam made during the design phase following a more
detailed investigation of the availability of material has confirmed the
earlier selection.
Service to the Poor
6.05      There is little reliable data on the urban poor, and the following
represents best estimates only, based on limited studies. An estimated 18% of
the urban population can be categorized as being below the absolute poverty
income level./l The population served in the five cities on project comple-
tion would be 3.5 million, about 90% of their total population. Using the 18%
estimate of the population in the absolute poverty category, the poor popula-
tion benefitting would be 630,000. Since the poor do not live in well defined
pockets and are scattered in areas which are also partly commercial and middle
income residential, no precise estimate is possible of what proportion of the
total project cost can be attributed to meeting the needs of the group.
Affordability
6.06      Assuming a poor family of 6 persons consuming 77 lcd (as found in
the 1979 Daegu Survey) the monthly household water consumption would be 14.0
cu m and the family would be charged W 500 - the minimum block rate for 15
cu m in effect at that time. Using the exchange rate of W 484 prevalent in
1979 - this represents 1.0% of the monthly income of $93 of a poor family at
the lower end of the scale (see para. 3.06). Assuming that incomes of poor
families increase at the same rate as inflation and the minimum block rate
increases at the same rate as average tariffs, the poor family in 1985 would
be charged about 1.7% of family income. This is not a high charge and in
part explains the anticipated reduction in the number of standpipes in the
cit-ies. The number of public/private standpipes (360 in Daegu, 23 in Gwangju
and 200 in Masan Region) are expected to be phased out by about 1990. The
/1 As defined by the Bank.



- 29 -
present charge for lifeline amounts (10 cu m/month) in Daegu is W 50 and if
purchased from vendors, about W 70 per cu m. This is a typical situation.
After project completion in 1986 the tariffs are likely to have increased
in the individual cities by between 30% and 80% in real terms over 1981.
This is reasonable in relation to the greatly improved service to be
provided and is affordable. This was discussed during negotiations and the
cities understood the implications of the financial covenants related to
increases of tariffs required to meet the 20% self-financing ratio and rate
of return requirements.
Incremental Rates of Return
6.07      The incremental rate of return (IRR) for each one of the
five projects was calculated in border prices using revenues from consumer
charges as a proxy for the economic benefit of the project. Details are at
Annex 8. Tariff increases were projected for all cities. Assuming that the
consumers will be willing to pay those tariffs, the IRR for the five
projects are adequate considering that they represent the minimum benefits
expected. The following table shows the IRR for each bureau and their
sensitivities to increases in costs and reductions in benefits:

Long Run Marginal Cost and Tariffs
6.08      The average incremental cost (AIC) method was used to compute the
long-run marginal cost. The following table presents the AIC for different
discount rates, compared to the average water rate for each project. It
shows that the tariffs expected to be implemented are not too far from the
AIC except for the comparatively less economically developed Jinhae and
Changwon.

Employment
6.09      The project construction is expected to generate demand totalling
420,000 man-days of skilled, 840,000 man-days of semiskilled and 2,000,000
man-days of unskilled labor. In addition employment in the city's water
supply systems is expected to increase - Masan region 50; Gwangju 60 and
Daegu 80.
Environmental Impact
6.10      Daegu and Masan are making plans to build wastewater treatment
facilities, while Changwon has a new sewage treatment plant. In Jinhae
waste water from domestic sources and industry pose a serious problem to the
bay and the city has plans for a future wastewater treatment plant. By
project completion time all of the cities could start implementing programs
for improving the environment and dealing with the additional waste water
generated by the project. All the cities have surface water drainage
systems in most areas and no unusual drainage problems are anticipated as a
result of the project.
Project Risks
6.11      Except for Daegu, this is the first major water supply expan,.ion
being undertaken by the Water Supply Bureaus of Masan and Gwangju. This is
also the first time that MOC has been involved in a major Bank project in
the sector. There is, however, adequate provision in the project for
engineering consultants to advise on project preparation and in designing
and supervision of construction of all the major components, There is also
an adequate number of skilled contractors in Korea who can construct tne
project. No unusual risks are therefore anticipated with the implemertation
program.



- 31 -
6.12      With regard to the institutional changes, the Government recognizes
their need and with Bank supervision missions giving this aspect special
attention, no unusual problems are anticipated.
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with Government and the
five cities on the following main points:
(a) that the Government would:
(i)  upgrade the organization of the sector (para. 1.06);
(ii)  study pollution in the Nakdong River Basin (para. 1.10);
(iii) carry out a manpower survey (para. 1.15);
(iv)  review future water supply investments in the Masan region
(para. 2.06); and
(v)  make satisfactory financing arrangements (paras. 5.05 and
5.06).
(b)  that the five cities would, respectively:
(i)  not transfer funds generated for water supply, introduce
accrual based accounting and appoint independent
auditors (para. 2.11);
(ii)  Daegu, Gwangju and Masan implement leakage surveys
(para. 3.07);
(iii)  complete all land acquisition by June 30, 1984 (4.19);
(iv)  employ consultants for supervision of construction (4.19);
(v)  not exceed the 1.3 debt service coverage; (5.11);
(vi)  take insurance against normal risks; (5.13); and
(vii) review annually their financial positions and
adjust tariffs to achieve the revenue covenants
(para. 5.14).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be the
strengthening and staffing of MOC's Water Supply Bureau (para. 2.02) and
the signature of the Regional Management Agreement between the cities of
Masan, Changwan and Jinhae (4.13).



- 32 -
7.03      Conditions of disbursement of the portions of the loan to be made
to the individual cities would be:
(a)  signing of subsidiary loan agreements (para. 2.01);
(b)  staffing of the Masan Project office (para. 4.13);
(c)  preparation by Gwangju of resettlement program
(para. 4.14);
(d)  Gwangju appointing ISWACO and an SBC (para. 4.14).
7.04      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of $90 million
for a term of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years.

KOREA
FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Gwangju City
New Dongbok Dam
Background
1.        Gwangju City employed Chas. T. Main in a joint venture with Korean
Engineering Consultants Ltd. to prepare the feasibility studies for
the selection of the source. The preliminary engineering studies which
proposed the New Dongbok Dam were reviewed by Mr. Ralph Bloor, Bank
consultant and on his advice additional drillings were carried out at the
Dongbok site. The results of the drilling were discussed by Mr. Bloor with
Chas. T. Main geologist and decided as being adequate for preparing an
estimate with a physical contingency provision of 15%. Following a change
in consultants, the studies were completed in August 1980 by Stanley
Associates Engineering Ltd. in association with Chas. T. Main and Korean
Engineering Consulting Corporation. Two members of the Special Board of
Consultants (SBC), a geologist and dam specialist, visited the site,
reviewed the reports and made comments on the Terms of Reference for the
detailed design. The SBC also reviewed the Terms of Reference of the
Industrial Sites and Water Resources Corporation (ISWACO) selected
by Gwangju City for construction management servcies.
Source Selection
2.        Least-Cost Solution.  The Dongbok dam site was selected as the
least-cost solution for source development for the first stage after a
review of all feasible alternative sources including groundwater
availability. The Juam dam site was selected as the source for the second
stage, up to year 2010.
Water Resources
3.        Groundwater Resources.  Groundwater is used extensively from some
12,000 shallow private wells (10 m to 30 m) and 500 public and irrigation
wells. Drilled wells up to 80 m in depth of diameters ranging from 150 mm
to 200 mm have widely varying yields - averaging 450 cu m/d in 30 wells, for
which data is available. Water in the shallow wells is generally polluted.
The aquifer is mostly alluvium - about 7 m in thickness - and bedrock forma-
tions of andesite and granite around the city. The weathering zone of the
bedrock varies from 1 m to 23 m and under certain conditions yields 500-700



- 34-                               Page 2
cu m/d.  There are five basins in the area suitable for  c 11k li r d evelop-
ment, however, natural recharge has been reduced because oF la-r base flows
in the rivers following the construction of irrigation dams, making
groundwater unreliable for long-term development as a municipal water supply
source. Groundwater is, however, being developed for agricultural and
industrial use.
4.        Surface Water Resources.  Surface water has been developed for
large irrigation - Dam Yang, Jang Seon and Seong Dong reservoirs managed by
the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC).  All these reservo-irs
control tributaries flowing into the Yeong San River. None  or them have
extra capacity to provide municipal water supplies. Neighboring basins are:
Boseong River, Seon Jin River and Tam Jin River. Potential reservoir sites
in these basins were screened for yield and dam design feasibility.
Precipitation studies were based on correlations of the annual rainfall
records of 25 stations in the region with that of Gwangju the longest (64
years) and most reliable of all. Hydrometric records or discharge
measurements are virtually nonexistent for the purposes of establishing
rainfall-runoff relationships or estimating yields. The consultants
therefore used the "Japanese Formula," an empirical relationship widely used
in Korea to calculate runoff. Due to lack of hydrologic data synthetic
runoff and flood hydrographs determined spillway designs and diversion
requirements. Reservoir capacity investigations and flood studies were made
for each selected dam site followed by a review of the available geological
information. The Yeong San River is tidal for a distance of 60 km from its
mouth near Mogpo. An estuary dam to prevent tidal inflow is expected to be
completed in 1981. The estuary reservoir is therefore a potential source for
Gwangju but would require a 70 km transmission pipeline with a static lift
of about 100 m and several pump stations.
5.        The preliminary screening eliminated the estuary reservoir as an
immediate source for Gwangju because it was not only the hoSt costly but
also was the lowest in water quality due to uncontrolled industrial and
organic pollution of the Yeong San River. Out of four possible dam sites 
Dongbok on the Dongbok tributary of the Boseong River, Dong Gae on the Dong
Gae tributary of the Seom-Jin River, Jam Heung on the Tam Jin River and Juan
on the Boseong River - two sites, Dongbok and Juam, were selected to be the
least-cost sources for closer study. Six alternatives were tested and tne
new Dongbok dam selected as the first stage project (see Alternative 1,
Chart 22347).
Dongbok Dam - Main Features
6.        Based on the hydrological analysis the followinlg capacities and
preliminary design parameters were established for a yield of 250,000 cu m/d,

8.        Information available from (i) the construction of the existing
mass concrete Dongbok Dam, (ii) the geological survey report on a proposal
(now abandoned in favor of the Juam site) to build a dam 100 m downstream of
the existing dam, and (iii) additional investigatory drilling   made by the
consultants provided the basis for their conclusions that with adequate
treatment of the foundation the site was suitable for a rockfill dam with
concrete face. This concluision was generally confirmed by Bank consultant
Mr. Bloor and subsequently by the two members of the SBC (para. 1.0).

FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Water Supplies in the Project Cities
General
1.        Water demand is about the same with a little variation because of
differing economic situations and state of facility development in each of
the five cities. Daegu is the fastest growing city, where despite recent
works to improve supply parts of the suburbs suffer shortages. All the
other cities experience severe water shortages - especially Gwangju in which
there has been no major facility development since 1973 when consumption
exceeded system capacity.
Water Resources
2.        Water resources unless carefully conserved would soon become
increasingly unreliable towards the end of the century in all of the five
cities. Groundwater is available in small quantities in Gwangju and
Changwon and is presently exploited by industry. It is also endangered by
industry in Changwon because of the uncontrolled discharge of industrial
wastes into adjacent water courses which recharge the aquifers. Jinhae
supplements its municipal water supply with 3 wells yielding small
quantities of about 2,000 cu m per day.
3.        Gwangju presently obtains its water from an upland catchment at
Dongbok about 18 km from the city. In the future it will have to go another
10 km to Juam for water. The other cities obtain their water from the
Nakdong River. Not only is this river becoming more and more polluted by
industry but also competing demands for water unless controlled could
decrease abstraction in the future. All of the cities are affected by the
cyclical droughts every five or 3iX years when water has to be rationed.
The government is alert to the situation and is taking action through a
program of water resources development and implementation of the
Environmental Preservation Law.
4.        Nagdong River.  The Nagdong River is 520 km long and has a drainage
basin of 23,656 sq km that covers almost one quarter of the country (see Map
IBRD 15431). Following an UNDP/FAO study in the late 1960s, the Government
has constructed and now operates the Andong multipurpose reservoir (storage
1,000 x 106 cu m) which regulates the flow of the main stem of the Nakdong
River from near its source, down to the sea at Busan. On the ma:in stem,
there are substantial abstractions and returns of water, which are used for
municipal, industrial, and agricultural (irrigation) purposes. The UNDP
study and later studies showed that the Andong reservoir would meet demands
on the main stem to the mid-1980s, provided droughts no more severe than the
1967/68 drought, judged to be the 1 in 10 year event occured. However, with
increasing development and use of the water resources of the basin, this
design drought criterion needs to be reviewed since the I in 10 year event
is too low a standard for large industry and municipal needs. Major resource



- 38 -                            ANNEX 2
Page 2
development works are usually designed and operated to withstand droughts of
1 in 20 year to 1 in 100 year frequency. The lower frequency relates to
works whose failure would have the greater adverse social and economic
impact, as it would in Daegu, Masan, Changwon and Busan.
5.        In parallel with proper development and management of the Basin's
water resources quantitatively is the protection of Twater quality. To
date, little attention or capital investment has been directed towards
the prevention of pollution of the Nakdong River. The predictions of river
water quality in the 1980s and 1990s are ominous, unless major wastewater
treatment facilities are installed. In respect of Daegu and the Masan
region, serious water treament problems for their municipal supplies will
arise, unless the quality of the Nakdong River is safeguarded. These
problems are almost exclusively from the discharge of untreated waste water
from Gumi and especially Daegu. Also the proposed installation of a barrage
at the mouth of the river below Busan to prevent saltwater intrusion could
compound pollution problems in the lower reaches. In order to ensure that
the water supplies for Daegu and the Masan Region are adequate, both in
terms of quantity and quality, the project provides for the preparation of
an environmental management plan with an optimum development strategy for
the day-to-day operation and management of the basin's resources both for
water quantity and water quality.
6.        Dongbok Reservoir.  An average of 60,000 cu m per day is pumped
to Gwangju City from the Dongbok reservoir, formed by a 18 m high mass
concrete dam, through a 800 mm diameter 28.5 km long raw water pipeline.
The reservoir has a catchment area of 189 sq km and a storage volume of
7.06 million cu m. Except for seasonal problems caused by algal growths which
make water treatment difficult, water quality is good. Detailed flow data for
the Dongbok reservoir are not available and the consultants used an empirical
Japanese Formula for projecting yield of the Dongbok catchment area./l It is
estimated that the safe yield of the catchment is 250,000 cu m per day.  The
raw water would be conveyed through an 18.8 km pipeline to a new treatment
plant near Gwangju. (Alternative 1, Chart - 22347). The feasiblity of this
proposal was tested against five other alternatives and selected as the least
cost solution for the first stage of a long term master plan to meet Gwangju-s
water supply needs. (See Annex 1 for description of the Dongbok Dam).
Existing Water Supply Systems
7.        Daegu.  All five cities have water supply systems.  The biggest
is in Daegu, which in addition to abstracting 240,000 cu m per day from the
/1 Chas. T. Main and the Korean Engineering Consulting Coporation made
the original calculations. Stanley Associates Engineering reviewed
the projection.

ANNEX 2
Page 3
Nagdong River, has three other local sources of varying quality and
reliability yielding another 1.10,000 cu m per day.  This is reputedly
the best water utility in the country. The water is treated in four
conventional water treatment plants the largest of which has a capacity of
220,000 cu m per day. The plants work generally well, there being few
operational problems.  The water is distributed through some 70 km of pipe of
diameter ranging from 1,200 mm to 150 mm at pressures varying between 2.0 to
5.0 kg/sq cm. Distribution storage volume in 35,060 cu m and there are
several booster stations. Chlorine residuals at these points vary between 0.3
and 1.0 ppm.  There were 131,445 service connections in 1978 of which 98% were
below 25 mm. All services are metered and unaccounted for water was reported
to be a high 36% in that year. This is reputedly the best Twater utility in
the country.
8.        Masan Region.  Masan, Ghangwon and Jinhae presently purchase
their raw water from MOC½s Majin Industrial Bulk Water Supply System. The
Majin system was built in two stages in 1967 and 1976 and has a total
capacity of 285,000 cu m per day. The source of supply is also the Nagdong
River. The two stages are built in parallel and have similar components:
river intakes, pumping stations, and about 18 km of raw water transmission
pipelines. The 1976 system has a design capacity of 200,000 cu m per day
and also a treatment plant with a capacity of 120,000 cu m per day and a
treated water transmission pipeline to serve industry. The Majin system
presently supplies 7,000 cu m per day of raw water to Jinhae, 42,000 cu m
per day to Masan and 1,600 cu m per day of treated water to Changwon. An
evaluation of the Majin system with a view to possible upgrading revealed
serious problems of silting of the river intake and bottlenecks in the
transmission system.  The system, although presently operating at 70% of
design capacity is expected to be fully used up in the next five years to
meet industrial demand.
9.       Masan's water treatment plant is badly designed, poorly operated
and situated in a commercial downtown location. The plant will 'be closed
down and the land sold when the proposed project is completed. Changwon is
about to complete work in developing a small local source expected to yield
10,000 cu m per day to supplement the MOC supply until the proposed project
is complete. Jinhae has in addition to the Majin supply another 6,000 cu m
per day of row water from local sources. The water is treated in a
conventional treatment plant with a design capacity of 25,000 cu m per day.
Some improvements such as providing treated water storage facilit:ies and
treatment quality control and maintenance are needed and are incLuded in the
proposed project.  The treated water is distributed th-ough some 71 km and
49 km of pipeline in Masan and Jinhae with diameters varying between 700 mm
and 75 mm.  Masan has 6,000 cu m of storage capacity, presently unused but
could be put into service when adequate water is available. At present both
cities suffer low pressures and in Masan water is distributed to six
different areas at various time periods each day. Chlorination is
intermittent and operational standards need considerable improvement.



ANNEX 2
- 40-                             Page 4
Changwon has the beginnings of a distribution system. The three cities had
18,345, 9,141 and 505 service connections at end of 1978, all of which
were metered9
10.      Gwangju.  In addition to the Dongbok reservoir, yielding 60,000 cu m
per day there are three local sources of varying degrees of reliability
bringing the average day supply to about 120,000 cu m per day. The water is
treated in two conventional treatment plants, the larger of which is rated at
105,000 cu m per day. Both plants need repair, upgrading and improvement in
operation and maintenance standards. There are some 157 km of distribution
piping with diameters varying between 1,000 mm and 50 mm with 14,000 cu m of
treated water storage at the treatment plant and 3,500 cu m in five booster
pumping zones. Service is very poor with negative pressures frequently
occurring in many parts of the system. Unaccounted for water is about 40%
mostly from leakage. All service connections are metered and there were
50,132 service connections at mid-1979. Chlorination is inadequate and
distribution service standards require improvement.
Metering
11.       The calibration of production meters reported to be difficult
problem in these cities. There is provision in the project for the training
of staff and rehabilitation works which includes the training of
instrumentation technicians. production metering. The maintenance of
domestic meters is. not a serious problem - the cities either sending defective
meters back to the factory for repair or doing it themselves in meter repair
workshop.

FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
Revenues
1.        Sales were calculated following the assumptions for demand, produc-
tion and unaccounted for water presented in Annex 6. Tariffs were increased
on April 1, 1981 and the average tariffs charged in 1981 as a result of this
increase are as follows (average tariffs won/cu m).
Gwangju   Daegu   Masan  Changwon  Jinhae
Previous tariff 1980          103       84       99      64        70
Average tariff 1981           156       102     160     103        94
% increase                     51        21      62      61        34
2.        A large tariff increase in the earlier part of the project
construction was necessary to generate the funds required and to better
reflect the actual production costs.
3.        A meter maintenance charge is customarily added to the water
bills. It has been assumed that it will be adjusted in line with the
inflation rate.
4.        It is usual practice in Korea to charge new users with a
connection fee in addition to the actual cost of construction and the meter.
It has been assumed that both costs will increase in line with inflation.
Since new connections in Gwangju will serve mostly low income areas, the
construction costs have been included in the project and it was assumed to
be recovered through the water tariffs and not by charging directly the new
customers. This procedure was considered advisable for Gwangju only given
its relatively less developed economy and it is expected to help avoid
delays in getting new customers connected to the system.
Operating Costs
5.        It was assumed that labor costs should reflect various degrees of
adjustments in the bureaus to correct present weaknesses and to handle a
larger level of operations. The following inflation rates were used to
escalate the operating costs: 19% in 1981, 14% in 1982, and 11% in 1983 and
thereafter.



- 72 -                              ANNEX 7
Page 2
6.        Cost of chemicals and power was projected to increase faster than
the general inflation level (3% for chemicals and 5% for power); addition-
ally they reflect the new operating characteristics of each system.
7.        It is expected that by 1984 the Government will have implemented
a charge to those who extract water from the Nakdong River. The charge was
assumed to be periodically adjusted for inflation.
8.        There is no reliable data on the present level of accounts
receivable. Nevertheless, it is clear that collection procedures are tight
and strictly enforced. Accordingly, it was considered that 30 days of
billing was an adequate assumption.
9.        Inventories are projected to reflect the requirements and
practices of each system.
10.       Accounts payable were estimated considering the level of investment
program of each bureau and their inventory requirements.
11.       Other assets mostly include advances to contractors.
Debt
12.       IBRD loan was assumed to be passed to the municipalities to cover
100% of the foreign component, with an interest rate of 11.6% p.a., 0.75%
commitment fee and a repayment period of 15 years including 3 years grace
period. A further 1% has been provided in the projections to cover the
possibility of foreign loan revaluation due to currency devaluation. The
funds provided by this additional 1% will be used to pay any additional
annual charge arising from loan revaluation or, if not so required, will be
held by the municipalities in reserve against future liabilities.
13.       Government loans were assumed to finance 50% of the local compo-
nents of all projects except for Gwangju for which a special government
decision increased it to 70%. Interest rate was assumed to remain as at
present 13% and as well as the repayment period of 20 years including 5
years of grace period.
14.       City bonds were assumed to be issued, following the present
practice, at 8% interest p.a. and repayment of interest and principal at the
end of five years.
15.       Changwon, instead of issuing city bonds, is planning to ailocate
from its Urban Development fund the amounts required for the project.

FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
1.        The internal rate of return was computed using border prices,
instead of domestic prices. The following conversion factors were used.
Standard            : 0.89
Skilled labor       : 0.89
Semiskilled labor  : 0.81
Unskilled labor         0.86
Investment          : 0.87
Electricity         :  0.89
Consumption         :  0.87
2.        All costs are expressed in January 1981 prices and include
engineering, administration and physical contingencies. Taxes and customs
duties have been deducted.
3.        Incremental revenues from consumer charges were used as a proxy
for economic benefits of the project. For this purpose, the average water
rates assumed to be effective at the end of the project construction were
deflated to January 1981 prices. Following negotiations tariff increases up
to 1985 were smoothed. Nevertheless as the forecast tariffs were modified
by less than 4% for 1985 and thereafter (which is within the range of the
sensitivity analysis), no changes were introduced in the economic
evaluation.
4.        Given the lumpiness of investment, Average Incremental Cost (AIC)
was used to estimate the Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC). Since border prices
were used to make the resulting AICs comparable with average tariffs, the
AICs were converted into domestic prices by dividing them by the conversion
factor for consumption. The conversion factor for consumption was used
since most of the incremental water sales in the project areas will go to
residential consumers.
